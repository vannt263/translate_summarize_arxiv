    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 has attracted much theoretical and experimental interest @xcite .",
    "the time reversal symmetry is broken for the superconductor sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 , and the magnetic field is spontaneously induced as shown by @xmath5sr experiment . @xcite .",
    "the knight - shift shows no change when passing through the superconducting state and is a clear indication for spin triplet pairing state , with a @xmath6-vector aligned to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "in addition the band structure calculations @xcite and de haas van alphen measurements @xcite show little dispersion along @xmath8 which is consistent with a two dimensional basis function on a cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a large residual density of states of quasiparticles inside the superconducting gap is evident from the linear temperature dependence of the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath9 of @xmath10ru bellow @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite also specific heat measurements support the scenario of line nodes within the gap as in the high @xmath12 cuprate superconductors @xcite .    in the tunneling experiments between normal metals and superconductors",
    "andreev reflection process take place @xcite . in the andreev reflection process an electron incident , in the barrier with an energy bellow the gap can not drain off into the superconductor .",
    "it is instead reflected as a hole and a cooper pair is transfered into the superconductor . in anisotropic high @xmath12 superconductors due to the sign change of the pair potential that the transmitted quasiparticles feel ,",
    "zero energy states are formed , which are detected as peaks in the conductance spectra at @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite also in the presence of an imaginary @xmath13-wave component , which breaks the time reversal symmetry , the zero energy peak is shifted to the amplitude of the subdominant component .",
    "@xcite    the properties of the andreev reflection are modified in the presence of an exchange field as in ferromagnet / insulator / superconductor junctions , since the retro - reflection of the andreev reflection is broken in the ferromagnet . this phenomenon has been clarified both in @xmath13-wave and @xmath14-wave junctions and interesting aspects of the andreev reflection have been revealed .",
    "@xcite also the properties of ferromagnet / insulator / triplet superconductor junctions have been studied where two types of pairing potentials are assumed for the triplet superconductor , i.e. the unitary and the non unitary with @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "@xcite in the unitary case the conductance within the gap is reduced with the exchange interaction while in the non unitary it is not much influenced since the latter pairing state conserves spin .    in order to identify the pairing state of sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations have been used to calculate the quasiparticle bound state wave function around non - magnetic impurities in unconventional superconductors .",
    "@xcite the characteristic patterns were distinguished for two proposed order parameters , ( i ) @xmath15 , and ( ii ) @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper we will use the bdg equations to calculate the tunneling conductance of ferromagnet / triplet superconductor contacts , with a barrier of arbitrary strength between them , in terms of the probability amplitudes of andreev and normal reflection . for the triplet superconductor we shall assume three possible pairing states of two dimensional order parameters , having line nodes within the ruo@xmath3 plane , which break the time reversal symmetry .",
    "the first two are the @xmath17 @xmath1-wave states proposed by hasegawa et al , @xcite having @xmath16 and @xmath18 symmetry respectively . the other one is called nodal @xmath0-wave state and has been proposed by dahm et al @xcite , where the pairing potential has the form @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",

    "generally the tunneling conductance is suppressed with the increase of the exchange interaction and the peaks are removed .",
    "this is due to the suppression of the andreev reflection in the ferromagnet . for the nodal pairing states",
    "the linear dependence of the tunneling conductance with @xmath22 is not much influenced .",
    "for the nodeless cases , the normalized conductance develops a constant value within the gap , which is suppressed as the exchange field gets larger .",
    "when the ferromagnet is a normal metal , the magnetic field splits the tunneling spectrum symmetrically around @xmath2 .",
    "the exchange field eliminates the negative branch of the tunneling spectra in the half metallic ferrogmagnetic limit .",
    "for spin - triplet superconductors the wave functions describing the quasiparticles @xmath23 are four - spinors in nambu ( particle - hole @xmath24 spin ) space .",
    "their particle and hole components are determined by the solutions of the bdg equations @xcite @xmath25 where , @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28 is the @xmath29 triplet pairing matrix with elements of the form @xmath30 , and the spin index @xmath13=@xmath31 , or @xmath32 .",
