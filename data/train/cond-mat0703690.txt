[ singlesyscoherence ] ) is almost the same for all possible initial nuclear configurations in the thermal ensemble , except for a global phase factor related to the static overhauser field resulting from the diagonal hyperfine interaction .",

    ". such recoherence by disentanglement is fundamentally different from spin echoes which result from re - focusing of random phases .",

    "the solution of the bath quantum dynamics provides a simple geometrical basis for the design of pulse sequences for recoherence .",

    "for example , a coherence recovery at a time different from the spin echo time would have been totally eclipsed in ensemble dynamics , since the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening is usually faster by orders of magnitude than the decoherence due to the entanglement .",
    "it is also shown that the single - pulse hahn echo signals do not measure the electron spin decoherence in fid configuration : first , the decoherence caused by hyperfine - mediated nuclear pair - flips has a strong effect on the fid when the external field is not too large , but it is removed from the hahn echo signal due to disentanglement ; second , the decoherence by the intrinsic nuclear spin interaction is also partially suppressed , which results in a hahn - echo decay time approximately @xmath263 times the fid time due to the intrinsic interaction . the decoherence behavior in single - system dynamics ( such as the recoherence at @xmath2 ) could eventually be directly observed in experiments if the inhomogeneous broadening can be filtered out , e.g. , by a projective measurement of the local overhauser field.@xcite    to observe the recoherence by disentanglement in ensemble experiments,@xcite pulse sequences can be designed to force the disentanglement to coincide with a spin echo . the simplest solution is the carr - purcell sequence , which has one pulse at @xmath1 and another at @xmath378 and forces the disentanglement to take place at the echo time @xmath294 .",
    "more sophisticated designs such as concatenated sequences can be employed to suppress the decoherence to an arbitrary order of the pulse delay time in units of the inverse nuclear interaction strength , and a repetition of the concatenated sequences can preserve the electron spin coherence until other decoherence mechanisms ( such as phonon scattering ) become significant .    the design of concatenated pulse sequences for disentanglement resembles the dynamical decoupling schemes which have been developed in decades for nmr spectroscopies@xcite and recently studied for quantum computation.@xcite the disentanglement schemes exploit the controlling power of pulse sequences in a subtly different way from the dynamical decoupling schemes : the latter uses short pulses to flip the quantum object frequently so that the object - bath interaction is dynamically averaged to zero , while the former does not seek to eliminate the effective coupling but rather focuses on controlling the evolution of the bath wavefunction .",
    "for example , for local nuclear spin pair - flips in the single - pulse control configuration , the effective interaction @xmath379 at the disentanglement time @xmath2 , defined by @xmath380 and @xmath381 , does not vanish even in the leading order of the hyperfine coupling .",
    "this is also the case for the disentanglement under the control of equally spaced pulses .",
    "one may question why a non - zero effective object - bath interaction could lead to vanishing decoherence .",
    "the reason is that the control steers the wavefunction evolution and the initial state of the bath is of some special form ( namely , the nuclear spin states at the temperature under consideration possesses no off - diagonal coherence ) .",
    "the disentanglement time is in general dependent on the initial state ( a universal disentanglement scheme independent of the initial state is only possible when the effective system - bath coupling vanishes ) .",
    "the dependence of the disentanglement on the initial state is implied in the control by evenly separated pulses shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_geometrycp ]  ( a ) : for instance , if the nuclear spins there at @xmath2 is set as the initial state ( which possesses off - diagonal two - spin coherence ) , the disentanglement after the electron spin flip at @xmath382 would occur at @xmath383 ( on the contrary , for initial states @xmath384 which has no off - diagonal coherence , the disentanglement occurs at @xmath385 ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to study the decoherence and the disentanglement for spin baths with certain initial off - diagonal coherence such as in quantum memory applications.@xcite    even though the concatenated disentanglement does cause the effective electron - nuclear coupling vanish , the difference from the dynamical decoupling is still unambiguously evidenced by their different controlling small parameters .",
    "the controlling small parameter in dynamical decoupling is the object - bath interaction strength , and the pulse delay time should be much shorter than the inverse of that strength . in the dynamical disentanglement , the object - bath interaction strength is a quite irrelevant parameter , but the short - time condition is given by the bath interaction .",
