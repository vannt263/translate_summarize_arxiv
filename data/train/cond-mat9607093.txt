    "the concept of symmetry breaking plays a crucial role in modern physics , and one of its most interesting consequences is the formation of topological defects .",
    "these defects have been observed and studied in a wide variety of condensed matter contexts , including metal crystallization@xcite , liquid crystals@xcite , superfluid helium@xcite and superconductors@xcite . in models where they are allowed",
    ", defects will form whenever the rate of the phase transition is fast relative to the scale of the system size ( in other words , a ` quench ' ) .    on the other hand , they are also believed to have formed in the early universe ,",
    "and they can play an extremely important part in its evolution@xcite . in this context , the conditions for their formation were first established by kibble@xcite  except for some subtleties in the case of the breaking of a gauge symmetry@xcite , they are entirely analogous .    the scaling evolution of vortex - string networks has been extensively studied analytically in both condensed matter and cosmological settings@xcite , but using rather different methods .",
    "this difference is perhaps understandable given the extremity of these two physical regimes , but it may not be necessary .",
    "condensed matter descriptions tend to focus on a coarse - grained order parameter @xmath0 , providing a low - level picture of defect motion by estimating energy dissipation rates .",
    "on the other hand , high energy physicists take an ` idealized ' one - dimensional view of string dynamics by integrating out the radial degrees of freedom ( in the higgs @xmath0 and other fields ) to obtain a low - energy effective action  the nambu action .",
    "the resulting relativistic equations of motion can then be averaged to describe the large - scale evolution of the string network .",
    "naturally one should also account for energy loss mechanisms , such as loop production  something that is not done in condensed - matter contexts .",
    "the analytical study of cosmological string networks was started one decade ago by kibble s ` one - scale ' model@xcite ( later modified by bennett@xcite and albrecht & turok@xcite ) .",
    "there it was assumed that the evolution of the long - string network could be described by a single lengthscale , which is usually called the ` correlation length ' .",
    "one then supposes that a scaling solution exists at late times and ends up showing that such a solution will in fact exist and be stable subject to conditions on the loop production mechanisms .",
    "one of the caveats of this model is that it is only valid in the latter evolutionary stages when strings are moving relativistically .",
    "however , at early times the string dynamics is friction - dominated , due to particle  string scattering .",
    "of course , this is also the relevant case in condensed matter physics .",
    "a model of string evolution including the effects of frictional forces has been recently proposed by the authors@xcite .",
    "it is a simple generalization of the ` one - scale ' model in which the average string rms velocity becomes a dynamical variable .",
    "this simple model provides the first quantitative description of the complete evolution of a string network in the early universe@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use it to study string evolution at constant temperature , which is relevant in condensed matter contexts .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that one can easily account for the production and evolution of string loops .",
    "although it should be seen as the basis for further work , the model is already predictive enough to be testable in laboratory experiments .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section , after a review of string dynamics , the evolution equations for the ` characteristic lengthscale ' and the average velocity of the long string network and each individual loop are derived and justified .",
    "the cases of strings arising from the breaking of gauge and global symmetries are both considered .",
    "the validity of these ` averaged ' evolution equations is then tested against a simple  but physically relevant ",
    "loop solution in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we describe string evolution at constant temperature .",
    "the case where the dynamics is friction - dominated is directly applicable to a whole range of situations in condensed - matter systems .",
    "it will be shown that this model can easily reproduce some well - known results , notably the @xmath1 law .",
    "furthermore , new quantitative predictions regarding loop evolution are made .",
    "we also discuss the opposite limit , where strings are initially ` free ' and find that in that case a network quickly evolves towards the previous regime .",
    "we note that the evolution equations for the string network and the string loops are relatively straightforward , but the intervening derivation is not . first - time readers may wish to skip straight to the results in section iv .",
    "the usual condensed matter approach to vortex dynamics is based on a ` coarse - grained ' complex scalar field @xmath0 . in quantum field theory , for example , one can consider the abelian - higgs model , which is a relativistic generalization of the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity .",
    "it is also of interest to consider the global version of this , that is the goldstone model .    in high - energy physics",
    "it also proves to be convenient to adopt a one - dimensional view of string dynamics ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the issues below ) . in this description",
    "a string sweeps out a two - dimensional surface ( the worldsheet ) which can be described by two ` worldsheet coordinates'one is time - like and can in fact be identified with the background time ( which we will denote by @xmath2 ) , while the other is space - like and simply labels points along the string ( we will call it @xmath3 ) .",
    "this one - dimensional description is essentially acheived by integrating over the radial modes of the vortex solution on the assumption that the scale of perturbations along the string is much larger than its width  thereby obtaining a low - energy effective action . for the case of a gauge ( global ) string , one thereby obtains the nambu ( kalb - ramond ) action from the abelian - higgs ( goldstone ) model .",
    "note that in the global case there are long range forces between the strings , in general there can be both external and self - field contributions to this .",
    "however , it can be shown ( again , see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) that the later can be ` renormalized out ' , yielding the well - known logarithmically divergent string energy per unit length @xmath4 ( which is a constant for gauge strings ) . by varying these actions",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain the string equations of motion .",
    "there is , however , a crucial ingredient for string evolution missing .",
    "since strings move through a background fluid , their motion is retarded by particle scattering .",
    "vilenkin has shown@xcite that this effect can be described by a frictional force per unit length that can be written @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the string velocity , @xmath7 is the lorentz factor and @xmath8 is a constant damping coefficient , that can be written as the square of a characteristic propagation speed ( which need not necessarily be the speed of light ) times a ` friction timescale ' @xmath9 , whose explicit value depends on the type of symmetry involved . for a gauge string ,",
    "the main contribution comes from aharonov - bohm scattering@xcite , while in the global case it comes from everett scattering@xcite .",
    "for example , if the background fluid is a perfect gas , we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the background temperature and @xmath12 is a numerical factor related to the number of particle species interacting with the string ( strictly speaking , its value is slightly different in the two cases , but a common symbol will be used for simplicity ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the everett scattering formula is only valid when the particle wavelength is much larger than the string thickness @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath8 can be written as the characteristic propagation speed times a ` friction lengthscale ' @xmath14 .",
    "for string motion in a flat background , the string equations of motion with the frictional force ( [ ff ] ) can then be written as@xcite @xmath15 @xmath16 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 ( which can be interpreted as a ` coordinate energy per unit length ' ) is defined by @xmath18 and dots and primes respectively denote time and space derivatives .",
    "this form of the evolution equations proves to be particularly useful because dissipation is naturally incorporated in the decay of the coordinate energy density @xmath17 , while preserving the gauge conditions .",
    "note that while this is a truly relativistic formalism , it is straightforward to obtain the non - relativistic limit that will be adequate to condensed matter contexts where the dynamics is friction - dominated . in this case ,",
    "( [ spc]-[epsil ] ) reduce to @xmath19 \\ , , \\label{nrll}\\ ] ] and one can recognize the right - hand side as the friction force term ( which is dominant in this limit ) , e.g. on a superfluid vortex@xcite    incidentally",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that a global string will behave as a superfluid vortex if it is introduced in a homogeneous background ( with a density @xmath20 , say)physically , this corresponds to giving it angular momentum .",
    "the interaction between this background and the string originates an additional force , known as the ( relativistic ) magnus force , and ( [ spc ] ) becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 ; note that ( [ tc ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "we can now proceed to average the string equations of motion to describe the large - scale evolution of the string network .",
    "we therefore define the total string energy and the average rms string velocity to be @xmath23 @xmath24 differentiating ( [ et ] ) and using ( [ tc ] ) and ( [ vv ] ) , we see that the total string energy density will obey the following evolution equation : @xmath25    this includes both long strings and loops which have a low probability of interacting with other strings before decaying .",
    "we shall study the evolution of the long - string network on the assumption that it can be characterized by a single lengthscale @xmath26 ; this can be interpreted as the inter - string distance or the ` correlation length ' .",
    "strings larger than @xmath26 will be called long or ` infinite ' ; otherwise they will be called loops . for brownian long strings",
    ", we can define the ` correlation length ' @xmath26 in terms of the network density ' refers to properties of the long ( ` infinite ' ) string network . ] @xmath27 as @xmath28    following kibble@xcite , the rate of loop production from long - string collisions can be estimated as follows .",
    "conceptually , we divide the network into a collection of segments of length @xmath26 , each in a volume @xmath29 .",
    "consider another segment of length @xmath30 moving with a velocity @xmath31 ; the probability of it encountering one of the other segments within a time @xmath32 is approximately @xmath33 .",
    "consistently with our ` one - scale ' assumption , we then assume that the probability of such an intersection creating a loop of length in the range @xmath30 to @xmath34 will be given by a scale - invariant function @xmath35 .",
    "the rate of energy loss into loops is then given by @xmath36 where the loop ` chopping ' efficiency @xmath37 is assumed to be constant . by subtracting the loop energy losses ( [ rtl ] ) from ( [ dens ] ) and then using ( [ correlation ] ) , we obtain the overall evolution equation for the characteristic lengthscale @xmath26 , @xmath38      the main advantage of the present approach is that we can also study the evolution of the loop density and distribution , which have so far been neglected in the condensed matter literature .",
    "the traditional approach in cosmology is to define @xmath39 to be the number density of loops with length in the range @xmath40 at time @xmath2 ; the corresponding loop energy density distribution is @xmath41 note that the total loop energy density is @xmath42 and @xmath43 ' refers to properties of the entire loop population , while ` @xmath44 ' refers to the loops with length in the range @xmath45 . ] from our assumptions on the loop production rate ( [ rtl ] ) it is then easy to see that @xmath46 however , note that this equation is ` static ' , in the sense that it does not include loop decay mechanisms .    instead , we start by using our analytic model to describe the evolution of each individual loop . knowing the energy density transferred from long strings into loops and estimating their sizes at formation ( see below )",
    ", one can determine the energy density in loops and other relevant quantities at all times .",
    "this formalism does not allow for possible loop reconnections or self - intersections but these should not be important in a friction - dominated regime .",
    "the physical size of a loop is simply given by @xmath47 and its time evolution is easily found to be @xmath48    now , we will assume that loop production is ` monochromatic ' , ie that loops formed at a time @xmath49 have an initial length @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a parameter of order unity .    with this ansatz",
    "the scale - invariant loop production function @xmath52 ( see ( [ rtl ] ) ) becomes @xmath53 and the rate of energy loss into loops becomes @xmath54    hence the energy density converted into loops from time @xmath2 to @xmath55 is @xmath56 this corresponds to a fraction @xmath57 of the energy density in the form of long strings at time @xmath2 .",
    "then using our ansatz ( [ wansatz ] ) , the corresponding number of loops produced in a volume @xmath58 is @xmath59 hence the ratio of the energy densities in loops and long strings at time @xmath2 is ( neglecting the initial loop population at @xmath60 ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the moment of the network formation and @xmath63 is the length at time @xmath2 of loops produced at time @xmath64 .",
    "we can therefore numerically ( and , in some simple limit cases , analytically ) determine the loop density at all times .",
    "this generalized ` one - scale ' model can therefore provide a complete description of a string network .",
    "we now consider the evolution of the average string velocity @xmath65 .",
    "a non - relativistic equation can be easily obtained : it is just newton s law , @xmath66 this merely states that curvature accelerates the strings while friction slows them down . on dimensional grounds",
    ", the force per unit length due to curvature should be @xmath4 over the curvature radius @xmath67 .",
    "the form of the damping force can be found similarly .    a relativistic generalization of the velocity evolution equation ( [ nonrelvel ] )",
    "can be obtained more rigorously by differentiating ( [ vv ] ) : @xmath68    this is exact up to second - order terms . in the curvature term ,",
    "we have introduced @xmath67 via the definition of the curvature radius vector , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a unit vector and @xmath71 is the physical length along the string ( related to the coordinate length @xmath3 by @xmath72 ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath73 is defined by @xmath74    note that in the case of long strings , our ` one - scale ' assumption implies that the curvature radius coincides with the correlation length , @xmath75 ; on the other hand , for a loop of size @xmath44 we should have @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 is ` phenomenological ' , and is related to the presence of small - scale ` wiggles ' on strings : on a perfectly smooth string , @xmath70 and @xmath77 will be parallel so @xmath78 ( up to a second - order term as above ) ; however this need not be so for a wiggly string@xcite . on the other hand , one can show that in flat spacetime ( with no friction ) @xmath79 .",
    "in the case of long strings , we should expect @xmath78 since the correlation length @xmath26 is much larger than the ` friction length ' @xmath14 .",
    "now , consider a particular string loop .",
    "while it is large compared with the friction lenghtscale , taking @xmath80 should again be a good assumption . in the opposite limit friction",
    "is no longer effective in damping its motion , and it moves as if it was in flat spacetime .",
    "thus one requires that @xmath81 as @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , demanding that their limiting velocity be @xmath83 leads to the requirement that @xmath84 as @xmath82 . with these requirements in mind , and after comparing with the ` microscopic ' ( ie , unaveraged ) evolution of some simple solutions ( to be described in the next section ) one arrives at the following ansatz : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a numerical coefficient@xcite of order one . recall that the physical loop length is approximately @xmath87 , while for the long - string network @xmath88 .",
    "equations ( [ evl ] ) , ( [ evlps ] ) and ( [ evv ] ) form the basis of our generalized ` one - scale ' model , which we will now proceed to apply .",
    "in order to check the validity of our ` averaged ' evolution model , and in particular our ansatz for @xmath73 , we will test it against a simple loop solution .",
    "consider a circular loop in a flat background with a constant friction timescale  that is , a condensed - matter - like situation .",
    "we can describe the loop trajectory simply by @xmath89 \\ , .",
    "\\label{ccl}\\ ] ] then equations ( [ spc],[tc ] ) reduce to @xmath90 note that the physical ( ` invariant ' ) loop radius is @xmath91 , obeying @xmath92 also the ` microscopic ' velocity is @xmath93 and obeys @xmath94    on the other hand , our averaged evolution equations ( [ evlps],[evv ] ) take the form @xmath95 @xmath96 notice the similarity between the two approaches . loops with size much larger than a ` friction lengthscale ' that can be defined in the obvious way from the friction timescale",
    "will be overdamped , with the velocity being approximately given by @xmath97 in this case the two sets of evolution equations actually coincide  hence justifying our @xmath78 ansatz for large r. as the loop gains velocity @xmath98 and @xmath67 become significantly different and this equivalence ceases to be valid .",
    "when @xmath67 becomes much smaller than @xmath14 , the loop still looses energy due to friction , but this is no longer effective in damping its motion  the loop now begins to oscillate relativistically . in particular , over one ` period ' @xmath65 oscillates between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "but we know that the averaged velocity should ( in the limit ) be @xmath101 ; this is the physical reason why we need a ` phenomenological ' varying @xmath73 on small scales .",
    "as we mentioned previously , this requirement fixes the behaviour of @xmath73 on small scales to be as shown in ( [ kans ] ) .",
    "the remaining question is then how to match the two regimes .",
    "first of all , we need a clear idea of when ( and where ) the transition occurs .",
    "a good guess would be the moment of the ` first collapse ' , ie , the moment when we first have @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , this turns out to be a well - defined event . as was first pointed out by garriga and sakellariadou@xcite ( and",
    "can be easily seen by analytical or numerical study of the equation of motion ( [ smallr ] ) ) , circular loops with initial radius much larger than the friction length always reach @xmath102 for the first time when @xmath103 note that @xmath104 is the physically relevant case for string dynamics in condensed matter contexts ( recall that the dynamics in that case is always friction - dominated ) .",
    "also note that because of friction , all loops will rapidly become ( almost ) circular .",
    "after numerically comparing the averaged and microscopic evolution equations , we find that the simplest possibility , @xmath105 ( see figure [ fig31 ] ) provides the best answer ( see figures [ fig32],[fig33 ] ) . in particular , this turns out to be significantly better than assuming smoother ( and slower ) transitions between the two regimes . as can be readily seen , this ansatz provides a very good fit , considering the lack of parameters available .    in passing ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that one can also easily calculate the loop lifetime@xcite . in the relativistic regime",
    ", the @xmath106 evolution equation can be written @xmath107 so we can immediately estimate that the loop will disappear in a time @xmath108 after its first collapse .",
    "having thus established , in a simple but physically relevant case , the validity of our generalized ` one - scale model ' , and in particular of the ansatz for @xmath73 , we now proceed to apply it to the study of string evolution in condensed matter contexts .",
    "as we already noted , in this case the dynamics is always dominated by friction .",
    "this means that the ` correlation length ' @xmath26 should always be larger than the ( constant ) friction length , so we can take @xmath78",
    ". then the evolution equations can be approximated by    @xmath109    @xmath110    the friction lengthscale and the string energy per unit length being respectively @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the temperature at which the strings form and @xmath71 is a constant .",
    "we then find the following late - time asymptotic behaviour : @xmath114 @xmath115 note that in both cases the asymptotic behaviour of the long - string density is @xmath116 the extra logarithmic dependencies in the global case cancel out .",
    "it should be emphasized that in condensed - matter analyses one does not consider loop formation , although there is experimental@xcite and computational evidence for them .",
    "our results show that loop formation can play an important evolutionary role",
    ". the asymptotic ratio of the loop production and friction terms is a constant , which is precisely @xmath37which in this way acquires a clearer physical meaning .",
    "as expected , increasing @xmath37 ( or including loop losses in the first place ) leads to a lower network scaling density and a smaller average velocity @xmath65 ; furthermore , the approach to the scaling regime is also faster .",
    "figure [ fig41 ] illustrates the relaxation to scaling of a network of gauge strings for a particular set of initial conditions , with and without loop production .",
    "the differences between the two cases are clearly visible .",
    "notice that in the gauge case the temperature only enters the scaling solution in the prefactor @xmath71 ; hence the plots of figure [ fig41 ] ( where the dimensionless variable @xmath117 is used ) are ` universal curves ' , that is , hold for all relevant temperatures .",
    "in the global case , the logarithmic dependence of the friction lengthscale gives rise to an additional logarithmic dependence of the scaling solution on temperature .",
    "one can define @xmath118 via @xmath119 ; in the goldstone model we then have @xmath120 the approach to scaling of a network of global strings is shown in figure [ fig42 ] for two different temperatures .",
    "note the enhancement of loop production at the early stages , since the string velocity is high ; correspondingly , there is a fast growth of the correlation length . comparing with the gauge case ( see figure [ fig41 ] ) , one finds that the effect of the extra logarithmic terms is significant for at least three orders of magnitude in time .",
    "now let us consider the loop populations . in the traditional ( that is ,",
    "` static ' ) approach one would simply calculate the loop distribution @xmath121 in the scaling regime  which we assume starts at some time @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding evolution equation is then @xmath123 since the loop size and velocity are initially ( that is , while the loops are overcritically damped ) slowly - varying quantities , this approach will only be accurate at the early stages of evolution of each lengthscale @xmath44 .",
    "afterwards @xmath44 and @xmath65 will vary quickly ( the averaged @xmath65 will be a constant later ) , and in this situation this approach is no longer useful . note that since friction is dominating the dynamics , irregularities are quickly erased and all loops become circular  hence the discussion of section 3 is particularly relevant here .",
    "consistent with what we found there , we will use the following simplifying ansatz @xmath124 ( where @xmath87 ) ; naturally in this approach only the first case is relevant .",
    "furthermore , the loop production parameter @xmath51 ( defined is ( [ inls ] ) ) should be a constant ( we are considering a scaling regime ) of order unity .",
    "after some algebra , we find the following solution @xmath125 } & \\mbox{$\\alpha l_s<\\ell < \\alpha l$ } \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{otherwise }   \\end{array } \\right . \\label{lpldelta}\\ ] ] where we have neglected any loops present at time @xmath122",
    ". note that in the global string case these expressions are only approximate , since there are additional logarithmic dependencies in the energy per unit length @xmath4 and the friction length @xmath14 .",
    "however , we can do more than that . to begin with",
    ", we can determine the loop lifetime .",
    "during most of it the loop will have a length greater than the friction lenghtscale , so we can approximate their velocity by ( [ vloopans ] ) .",
    "then its length will vary according to @xmath126 so its lifetime is @xmath127    of course a more accurate result can be obtained numerically ( see figure [ fig43 ] ) ; for large enough loops we find @xmath128 showing our analytical estimate to be correct to within a fraction of one percent .    on the other hand , we can simply use ( [ ratio ] ) to determine the ratio of the energy densities in the form of loops and long strings . in this case , taking @xmath129 , it simplifies to @xmath130    in fact , an approximate analytic solution for @xmath131 can be found in the scaling regime .",
    "we will assume that such a regime starts at a time @xmath122 and neglect any existing loops at @xmath122 .",
    "the contribution of each loop to the loop density will only be significant while it overdamped . in this regime",
    "we can assume that its length is approximately constant , @xmath132 ( hence we will be deriving an overestimate of @xmath131 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the end of this regime approximately coincides with the moment of loop decay , which according to ( [ llifecdm ] ) for a loop formed at time @xmath64 happens at @xmath133 t ' \\ , , \\label{estimativa}\\ ] ] for a loop formed at time @xmath64 .",
    "then we have @xmath134 and there are two corresponding cases to consider for the integral ( [ ratiod ] ) ( see figure [ fig44 ] ) , according to whether or not loops have decayed at the time in question , @xmath135 where @xmath136 we then obtain @xmath137    this is easily confirmed numerically",
    ". figure [ fig45 ] displays the evolution of the ratio of the loop and long string densities corresponding to the gauge string network of figure [ fig41 ] . in this case @xmath138 , so our analytical estimate is @xmath139 , while numerically we find @xmath140 .",
    "notice that with our initial conditions the ratio of the energy densities in loops and long strings is larger while the network is approaching scaling than in the scaling regime .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that loops with initial sizes not much larger than the friction lengthscale live longer than predicted by ( [ llifecdm ] ) ( as can be seen in figure [ fig43 ] ) .",
    "naturally , since we can find out how each loop evolves , it is always possible to find out how many loops there are at any time on any given length interval .",
    "note that in this context reconnections and self - intersections should be negligible , at least when the loops are large compared to @xmath14 ( because they are non - relativistic)which is when their contribution to the loop density is significant .",
    "furthermore , using the results from our discussion in section 2c , we easily find that the fraction of the energy density in long strings at time @xmath2 that is converted into loops in the time interval @xmath141 is asymptotically @xmath142 note that this is a very small number .",
    "furthermore , note that as we increase @xmath37 there is a limiting fraction .",
    "also , the number of loops formed in a time interval @xmath141 and volume @xmath143 is @xmath144 in this case , @xmath145 goes to zero as @xmath37 grows  this is because @xmath26 and hence the loop size at formation grow with @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath146 scaling law for the characteristic lengthscale is a well - known result in the theory of phase ordering ( that is , the growth of ` order'as measured by some correlation length  by domain coarsening when a system is ` quenched ' from a homogeneous phase into a broken - symmetry phase ) with a non - conserved order parameter . in this context",
    "it is usually called the lifshitz - allen - cahn@xcite growth law , and it is widely supported by simulations and experiment@xcite ( see also ref . for a recent review ) . in the usual approach ,",
    "one sets up a continuum description in terms of a coarse - grained order parameter @xmath0 and then assumes a _ scaling hypothesis _ , that is , that at late times there is a single lengthscale such that the domain structure is time - independent ( in a statistical sense ) when all lengths are rescaled by it .",
    "the growth law is usually derived by studying the dynamics of the defects in @xmath0 ( see , for example , section 3 in bray s review@xcite ) . a recent alternative approach@xcite proceeds instead by comparing the global rate of energy change due to the energy dissipation to the local evolution of the order parameter ; with the scaling hypothesis , the time - dependence of the lengthscale can be determined self - consistently .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 law has been experimentally confirmed for the evolution of a string network in a nematic liquid crystal ( roughly speaking , a liquid made of rod - like molecules)eg , see ref .",
    "where , as mentioned , loop formation and decay have been seen .",
    "the @xmath147 scaling law is also known in hydrodynamical contexts .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that it holds for superfluid vortex - rings@xcite in the context of a modified goldstone model ( in a way described in the previous section ) .",
    "hence the above result seems to indicate that a global string network at constant temperature asymptotically behaves as if it was made of loops of size @xmath26 .",
    "as we hopefully made clear , the above discussion of the loop lifetime and density is entirely new in this context .",
    "it is hoped that these results , obtained in a fairly simple way in this approach will stimulate condensed matter theoreticians an experimentalists ...    finally , in the case of superfluid vortices , despite the additional magnus force term , the evolution equations also have the form ( [ evlcml],[evlcmv ] ) . in this case , however , the physical meaning of the friction lengthscale is not clear .",
    "furthermore , it is also not clear how one can describe the effect of the magnus force on the evolution of the network .",
    "we hope to address these issues at a later stage .",
    "therefore , a model aimed at describing the evolution of cosmic strings@xcite can be straightforwardly applied to rather more ` down - to - earth ' situations , with some advantages over previously existing analytical approaches ( in particular , allowing a precise treatment of loop production ) .",
    "this is rather remarkable , considering the difference in the energy scales involved .      as a matter of completeness as well as mathematical curiosity ,",
    "we now consider the evolution of a string network in flat space with a constant friction lengthscale when the initial conditions are such that the correlation length is much smaller than the friction lengthscale .",
    "this is therefore the opposite regime to that usually observed in condensed matter .",
    "the evolution equations will now be @xmath148 @xmath149 where we will assume that our ansatz for @xmath73 for string loops also holds for long strings ( see ref . for a more complete discussion of this point )",
    ", that is @xmath150    in the regime where @xmath151 the @xmath65-equation is independent of @xmath26 , so its particularly easy to find the scaling regime @xmath152 - 2\\sqrt{2}{\\tilde c } \\ , , \\label{lfast}\\ ] ] @xmath153    hence @xmath26 grows exponentially fast and quickly ` catches up ' with @xmath14 ; in other words , a network starting in the ` free ' regime rapidly evolves to the usual friction - dominated regime .",
    "figure [ fig46 ] displays the evolution of a gauge string network in the free regime , and in particular the transition to the damped regime .",
    "note that if loop production is allowed , this fast growth of the correlation length will obviously mean that an extremely large number of loops is produced . in this case",
    ", the energy density in loops actually exceeds the energy in long strings  in the above plot , by a factor of @xmath154 .",
    "a word of caution is however needed here . in this case",
    ", loop reconnections onto the long string network should play an important role .",
    "however , since we still get an exponential growth if loop production is switched off ( @xmath155)although the growth rate of @xmath26 is obviously much larger for @xmath156our results should at least be qualitatively correct .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the applicability in condensed matter contexts of a recently - developed model of string evolution@xcite , where a ` characteristic lengthscale ' and the average velocity are the dynamical variables .",
    "this has allowed us to properly describe friction - dominated string dynamics , hence providing the first complete and fully quantitative study of string networks and their corresponding loop populations in condensed matter ( as well as cosmological@xcite ) contexts .",
    "the fact that these results can be obtained in a model initially aimed at describing cosmic string evolution is , of course , a manifestation of the universality of symmetry breaking and defect formation phenomena , but it also lends weight to the validity of this approach because these cosmological models have been extensively tested numerically .    we have confirmed two previously known condensed matter scaling laws , while noting the significant effects of loop production ( which is not considered in standard approaches ) .",
    "we also presented the first ( analytic or otherwise ) discussion of the evolution of the overall loop density , while also determining loop lifetimes .",
    "as we have already stated , the literature on string loops in phase ordering kinetics appears to be restricted to a few references to the observation of loop production and decay in laboratory experiments@xcite .",
    "it is hoped that these more quantitative predictions will trigger further efforts from the condensed matter community .",
