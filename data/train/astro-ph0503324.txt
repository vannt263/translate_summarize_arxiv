    "the fate of the most massive stars in galaxies is not well understood .",
    "such stars have been theoretically linked to black - hole formation , to some gamma - ray burst sources , and to early metal enrichment in the universe ( e.g. , umeda & nomoto 2003 ) . in principle , stars with initial masses @xmath4@xmath5 should pass through the red supergiant phase , or directly to the short - lived luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase , on to the wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase ( e.g. , langer et al .",
    "1994 ; stothers & chin 1996 ) , before exploding as supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , woosley , langer , & weaver 1993 ) or ending as `` collapsars '' ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . the great eruption of 1843 for @xmath0 carinae ( see davidson & humphreys 1997 ) , where the star s bolometric luminosity increased by a very large amount , demonstrated that some very massive stars go through spectacular eruptive phases of pre - sn mass ejection . this instability may play a role in shaping the appearance of the upper hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "however , lbvs , and particularly phenomenal cases such as @xmath0 car , are extremely rare ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) ; isolating additional examples is therefore necessary for a better understanding of the evolution of very massive stars .    the identification of a number of extragalactic objects as genuine sne ( strictly defined to be the violent destruction of a star at the end of its life ) has been questioned by several teams of investigators ( e.g. , goodrich et al",
    ".  1989 ; filippenko et al .  1995 ; van dyk et al .  2000 , 2004 ; smith , humphreys , & gehrz 2001 ; wagner et al .  2004 ) .",
    "these authors have argued that the `` sn impostors '' are more likely the pre - sn cataclysmic event of a very massive star , analogous to @xmath0 car ( hence , the term  @xmath0 car analogs \" or `` @xmath0 car variables '' ; humphreys , davidson , & smith 1999 ) .",
    "similarly to @xmath0 car , the precursor star is expected to survive the eruptive super - outburst .",
    "the prototypical examples are sn 1961v in ngc 1058 ( zwicky 1964 ; goodrich et al . 1989 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; humphreys et al . 1999 ; van dyk , filippenko , & li 2002 ) and sn 1954j in ngc 2403 ( humphreys et al . 1999 ; smith et al .",
    "five more - recent examples are sn 1997bs in m66 ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) , sn 1999bw in ngc 3198 ( filippenko , li , & modjaz 1999 ) , sn 2000ch in ngc 3432 ( filippenko 2000 ; wagner et al . 2004 ) , sn 2001ac in ngc 3504 ( matheson et al . 2001 ) , and sn 2002 kg , also in ngc 2403 ( schwartz & li 2002 ) .",

    "1999 ) and sn 2002 kg ( weis & bomans 2005 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2005 ) , luminous , very massive precursor stars have been directly identified .    whereas the early - time optical spectrum of sn 1961v was dominated by narrow emission lines of h , he  i , and fe  ii ( indicating a relatively low maximum expansion velocity of @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ; zwicky 1964 ) , similar to what is seen for",
    "the  type iin \" sn classification ( schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 ) , no spectra of sn 1954j exist at a comparable epoch .",
    "the identification of this latter event as a sn , therefore , has always been debatable .",
    "kowal et al .",
    "( 1972 ) considered it a sn , possibly of  type v \" ( zwicky 1965 ) , based on the relative similarity of its light curve to the highly peculiar one of sn 1961v .",
    "tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) had identified the object as an irregular blue variable , variable 12 ( v12 ; see their figure 11 for the unusual light curve ) . in quiescence",
    "the star showed only minor variability , with @xmath8 mag , but subsequently in outburst it fluctuated drastically in brightness over a 5-yr span , beginning in 1949 , reaching a maximum @xmath9 mag in mid - to - late 1954 , when it was the brightest star in ngc 2403 . by late 1954 , it had declined steeply to a level fainter than its pre - outburst state .",

    "no survivor of an extragalactic super - outburst has yet been unambiguously recovered years to decades afterwards .",
    "the most contentious case is sn 1961v ( see chu et al .",
    "2004 ; van dyk 2005 , and references therein ) , where an @xmath0 car - like star has been detected in the sn environment , but it is still uncertain if it can be directly linked to a putative survivor . a more clear - cut case may be sn 1954j / v12 , where smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) first identified , through ground - based optical ( @xmath10 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath11 ) imaging , an object they considered the post - outburst survivor star .    here",
    "we contribute further imaging of sn 1954j / v12 from the ground with the keck - i 10-m telescope and the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope , confirming the source identified by smith et al .",
    "more importantly , we demonstrate with the superior spatial resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) that the object seen from the ground is actually a group of stars .",
    "furthermore , we are able to isolate a star within the group as the likely candidate for the 1954 super - outburst survivor . by combining these data with an optical spectrum from the keck - ii telescope",
    ", we argue that this star is a rare , very luminous and massive , @xmath0 car - like variable star .",
    "we assume throughout this paper that the true distance modulus to ngc 2403 is @xmath12 mag ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) . at this distance",
    ", 1  corresponds to 15.2 pc .",
    "sn 1954j / v12 was imaged in @xmath13 with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck - i telescope on 1996 october 20 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "exposure times were 240 s in each band , and the seeing was quite good in the @xmath14-band ( @xmath15 ) , less so at @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , and mediocre at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , largely due to less - than - optimal focus ) .",
    "standard image - calibration procedures ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , etc . ) were employed in the reduction of these data .",
    "we extracted photometry from these images using iraf / daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and fitting an empirically derived model point - spread function ( psf ) for each band .",
    "unfortunately , no photometric calibration was obtained during this night ; thus , we had to tie the photometry to the calibrated photometry obtained from the nordic optical telescope ( not ) images ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "from the digitized red poss - i image ( the digitized sky survey ; dss ) we measure an accurate absolute position for sn 1954j / v12 of @xmath20(j2000 ) = @xmath21 , @xmath22(j2000 ) = @xmath23 , with a total uncertainty of @xmath24 , using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) as the astrometric reference ( see van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003 ) . applying the same astrometric grid to the keck images , we confirm in these images at this position the source identified by smith et al .",

    "the appearance of the source changes in the @xmath16 band ; see figure 1 ( right panel ) .",
    "two closely spaced sources are identified by daophot in this band , with the `` appendage '' source becoming more obvious , and the main source to the north containing less light in this band .",
    "we identify the main source , seen clearly in the left panel , as the smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) object and list its photometry from the keck images in table 1 , along with the photometry from smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "larsen & richtler ( 1999 ) obtained @xmath10 ( plus h@xmath20 ) images of ngc 2403 with the 2.56-m not on 1997 october 13 , under very good seeing conditions of @xmath26 .",
    "these images were contributed to the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) and posted for public distribution on their website .",
    "we extracted photometry from the broad - band images , first with a 4  aperture and then using psf fitting within iraf / daophot .",
    "the resulting instrumental psf - fitting magnitudes , after aperture corrections , were calibrated using photometry of a number of isolated stars in the images through a 20  aperture , which matches the aperture used to establish the calibration through observations of standard stars by larsen ( 1999 ; his table 1 and  3.1 ; we also first applied the appropriate extinction corrections , supplied via a private communication from s.  s.  larsen ) .",
    "we have compared the overall photometry with the @xmath27 bright - star photometry in sandage ( 1984 ) and @xmath28 photometry in zickgraf & humphreys ( 1991 ) and find very good agreement across all bands .",
    "the same astrometric grid applied to the dss and keck images was also applied to the not images , again confirming the smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) source .",
    "the varying shape of the source as a function of wavelength , as seen in the keck images , is also seen in the not data . in particular , the `` appendage '' is also detected in the not @xmath16-band image .",
    "the @xmath10 photometry for the source from the not images is given in table 1 .",
    "an optical spectrum of the sn 1954j / v12 site was obtained with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) on the keck - ii telescope on 2002 november 9.56 ( exposure time 2400  s ) .",
    "the 1  slit included both the smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) source and the `` appendage , '' but the seeing was poor ( @xmath29 ) and the two sources were blended .",
    "variable seeing ( it was @xmath30 during the observation of the standard star ) and the presence of thin cirrus compromised the absolute flux calibration to some degree .",
    "conventional data reductions were performed within iraf , including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and wavelength calibration , while our own idl routines were used for flux calibration and removal of telluric lines ( e.g. , matheson et al .",
    "the extraction from the relevant order containing h@xmath20 ( the only feature detected in the overall spectrum ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "although the spectrum is somewhat noisy , broad - line emission with full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath311650 km s@xmath7 is clearly seen .",
    "the gaussian velocity width , @xmath32 , of the line is then @xmath31700 km s@xmath7 . the equivalent width of this emission line is @xmath31240   .",
    "we suspect the origin of this emission is either within the extended source or from the appendage , but can not tell from the spectrum alone ( we discuss this in more detail below ) .",
    "the recent , bright sn 2004dj in ngc 2403 was imaged by program go-10182 ( pi : filippenko ) with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on - board _ hst _ on 2004 august 17 .",
    "both the wide field channel ( wfc ) and the high resolution channel ( hrc ) were used , and the resulting data immediately became publicly available in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "images were obtained with the wfc in the bands f475w , f606w , f814w , and f658n , with respective exposure times of 600 , 350 , 350 , and 650 s. the imaging strategy for sn 2004dj was purposely designed so that the site of sn 1954j / v12 would also be contained in the wfc images .",
    "we recombined the individual flat - fielded `` flt '' exposures in all four bands at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) , in order to more reliably remove cosmic - ray hit features from the images , and , in effect , produce our own drizzled ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) `` drz '' images independent of the _ hst _ data pipeline . in figure 3",
    "we show the f606w , f814w , and f658n images .",
    "comparison with figure 1 ( in particular , see the inset to figure 3a ) clearly shows that the source identified from the ground is actually a resolved group ( or cluster ) of stars .",
    "we label in figure 3 the four brightest members of the cluster , in decreasing order of their f606w apparent brightness .    since the stellar environment is crowded , we measured the brightnesses of the four stars in the three broad - band images and the one narrow - band image using daophot , fitting the stellar profiles with psfs , based on a @xmath33 aperture and generated from the @xmath34 brightest , uncrowded stars in a @xmath35 pixel area around the sn site .",
    "we verified that this produces , to within the measurement uncertainties , equivalent results as measuring , first , the instrumental magnitudes through a @xmath36 aperture and , second , correcting these magnitudes to those through a @xmath33 aperture , at least for the two blue broad bands ( aperture corrections for the f814w band are more complex , due to the possible presence of the red halo feature around stars ; see sirianni et al .",
    "we determined that any correction to the magnitudes for the degradation of charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) is @xmath370.6% in the three broad bands ( see riess & mack 2004 ) .",
    "the cte correction for the f658n band measurements , however , was more appreciable , at @xmath312% .    for the f475w , f606w , and f658n measurements we next applied the correction from a @xmath33 aperture to infinite aperture from table 5 in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; the same is also true for the blue star 3 in the f814w band . for stars 1 , 2 , and 4 in the f814w band we applied the corrections from figure 12 in sirianni",
    "we then applied the zeropoints in table 11 of sirianni et al .  to the corrected instrumental magnitudes , vegamag for the broad bands and stmag for the narrow band",
    "the resulting flight system magnitudes are given in table 2 .",
    "we also transform the broad - band magnitudes into the standard johnson - cousins system , following the translation established by sirianni et al .",
    ", with the understanding that this transformation is fraught with uncertainties , especially for objects with non - standard photospheres .",
    "furthermore , we do not know _ a priori _ the extinction toward the four stars , so we perform the transformation for each star first , then establish the extinction , contrary to the recommendation by sirianni et al .",
    "in table 2 we list the resulting @xmath38 magnitudes for the four stars .",
    "we suggest that what is seen from the ground for sn 1954j / v12 is the composite of the stars resolved in the _ hst _ images , with the various individual stars contributing different amounts to the overall brightness at different wavelengths .",
    "this is borne out in table 1 , where at @xmath38 we sum up the flux contributions from stars 1 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "( when the wfc images are smoothed using a gaussian with widths corresponding to the ground - based seeing for the keck and not images , it is readily apparent that the smith et al .",
    "2001 source consists of these three stars . )",
    "star 2 is almost certainly the `` appendage '' to the main source , as seen from the ground , and we therefore do not include the contribution from its light .",
    "these sums at each band agree quite well with the brightness of sn 1954j / v12 in the ground - based measurements .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath39 and @xmath16 magnitudes from smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are generally fainter than the other measurements .",
    "( smith et al .  employed a 1  aperture with 2  seeing for their measurements , and for the @xmath16 band the measurement",
    "is tied to one comparison star , without an adequate set of observed standard stars , which could account for some of the discrepancies . )",
    "also , our @xmath40 measurement from the 1997 image data and our @xmath18 measurement from the 1996 data are somewhat brighter than the ensemble in that band , but we have already noted the degraded focus in the keck @xmath18-band image .",
    "we can not exclude that one or more of the stars in the environment , even sn 1954j / v12 itself , is somewhat variable .",
    "however , it appears that the brightness and color of the smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) source have been relatively constant overall between 1996 and 2004 .",
    "the properties ( line width , equivalent width ) of the broad h@xmath20 emission line in sn 1954j / v12 , as seen in the ground - based spectrum , are strikingly similar to those of @xmath0 car itself . in figure 4",
    "we directly compare the sn 1954j / v12 spectrum with a recent ( 1998 january 1 ) spectrum of @xmath0 car obtained with _",
    "hst_/stis by the _ hst _",
    "treasury program ( go-9420 ; pi : k.  davidson ) on @xmath0 car .",
    "the broad components of the two spectra agree quite well , although the narrower component , as well as the pronounced p - cygni profile in the broader component , seen in the @xmath0 car spectrum are both noticeably absent in the sn 1954j / v12 spectrum .",
    "we contend that this late - time spectrum of sn 1954j / v12 is not of a decades - old sn : the spectrum of sn 1957d in m83 , of comparable age , is dominated by lines due to oxygen with velocities in excess of @xmath312000 km s@xmath7 ( long , winkler , & blair 1992 ) .",
    "we also consider the probability of such a rare @xmath0 car - like object being in the immediate vicinity of sn 1954j / v12 ( which photometrically resembles @xmath0 car ; humphreys et al .",
    "1999 ) , yet _ not _ being the sn itself , to be extremely small .",
    "it is most likely that one of the four brightest stars at the sn site seen in the _ hst _ images is the source of the broad h@xmath20 emission in the keck spectrum , and that it is the survivor of the sn 1954j / v12 outburst .",
    "but , which one ?    examining figure 3c we see that , within the environment , one star has a clear , luminous excess of emission in the f658n band , relative to the other three stars . comparing with figures 3a and 3b , star 4 is exactly at the position of this emission source . from table 2",
    "we see that the stmag for star 4 at f658n is @xmath41 mag ( without any continuum subtraction ) , which corresponds to an equivalent flux density per unit wavelength of @xmath42 erg s@xmath7 @xmath43 @xmath7 .",
    "we note that this agrees quite well with the value of @xmath44 near 6580    in the spectrum shown in figure 2 .",
    "( this agreement assumes that the line flux has not changed between 2002 november and 2004 august , and also may be fortuitous , given the variable seeing conditions and thin cirrus present at the time of the keck observations . )",
    "thus , we find it suggestive that the source of the broad h@xmath20 emission is indeed star 4 .",
    "this is further supported by inspection of the 2-dimensional esi spectrum of the specific order ( # 9 ) containing h@xmath20 . in figure",
    "1a we label a star ( `` a '' ) , to the northeast of the sn environment , which also fell within the esi slit . using this star as a fiducial , and measuring the spatial offset between the spatial peak of this fiducial star s spectrum and that of the h@xmath20 source",
    ", we find @xmath45 . measuring the offsets between this star and stars in the grouping on the acs / wfc images",
    ", we find @xmath46 for star 1 , @xmath47 for star 2 , @xmath48 for star 3 , and @xmath49 for star 4 ( with uncertainties of @xmath50 wfc pixel , i.e. , @xmath51 ) . we can reject stars 1 and 2 as the h@xmath20 source , given their large displacement from the fiducial .",
    "star 3 , at face value , is in closest agreement with the spectrum offset ; however , we see very weak emission in the f658n image at its position ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this , again , leaves star 4 as the most likely candidate for the emission seen in the spectrum , whose displacement from the fiducial star is within the uncertainties in the measured offset .    what are the stars in the environment of sn 1954j / v12 ? in particular , are the characteristics of star 4 consistent with an @xmath0 car - like star and the survivor of sn 1954j / v12 , as suggested by the spectrum ?",
    "to provide possible answers to these questions , we place the four stars ( from the magnitudes in table 2 ) on a [ ( @xmath52 ) , ( @xmath53 ) ] color - color diagram , shown in figure 5 . also illustrated are the intrinsic color tracks for dwarfs and supergiants from drilling & landolt ( 2000 ) , as well as the reddening vector for the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) reddening law .",
    "we note that , for these colors , the reddening vector runs parallel to the stellar tracks . at their exposure levels",
    ", we would expect the acs images to be sensitive generally to supergiants and the bright end of the main sequence .",
    "stars 1 and 2 could be blue supergiants experiencing local extinction @xmath54 mag",
    ". however , their absolute magnitudes , corrected for this extinction and the true distance modulus , would then be an implausible @xmath55 .",
    "these two stars could possibly be reddened , luminous yellow ( g - type ) supergiants ; in this case , the required extinction would be @xmath56 mag , with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 mag . however , such yellow supergiants , or so - called hypergiants , are relatively rare ( it seems even less likely that _ both _ stars would be hypergiants ) . alternatively",
    ", both stars 1 and 2 have colors consistent with early - m supergiants ( at least for @xmath53 ; the transformation to @xmath52 appears to be too red , but the uncertainty in this color for both stars is large and still consistent with the supergiant track ) , assuming low reddening ( the galactic contribution to extinction toward ngc 2403 is only @xmath60 mag ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) , and we consider this the more likely case .    star 3 could be a blue star with @xmath61 mag ; its reddening - free colors would be @xmath62 and @xmath63 mag ; its absolute magnitude , @xmath64 , would imply that it is a hot main - sequence dwarf . however , star 3 also has colors consistent with early - a to early - f type with little reddening ( although the star s locus is offset in color by @xmath65 from the stellar tracks in figure 5 ) . additionally , this star is @xmath310.7 mag fainter in f658n than in f606w , implying a relatively high h@xmath20 absorption equivalent width , consistent with an a - type star ; using the stsdas package synphot , together with synthetic spectra from the bruzual - persson - gunn - stryker ( bpgs ) spectral atlas , we find that the flight - system colors for this star are most consistent with those of an early - to - mid a star .",
    "its inferred absolute magnitude is then only @xmath66 .    with little reddening , star 4",
    "has colors generally consistent with spectral type g ( although its locus in figure 5 is also offset in color by @xmath65 from the stellar tracks ) .",
    "based on its observed brightness , it would have to be a supergiant .",
    "however , we would still need to account for the presence of the broad h@xmath20 line from a g - type supergiant .",
    "the yellow supergiants ( hypergiants ) , such as @xmath67 cassiopeiae ( e.g. , lobel et al .",
    "2003 ) , do show h@xmath20 emission associated with a massive wind .",
    "however , the emission profile for @xmath67 cas is quite different in shape , velocity width , and equivalent width from what we see in the keck spectrum for star 4 .",
    "additionally , @xmath67 cas , spectroscopically of late - f or early - g type , has @xmath682 mag ( e.g. , joshi & rautela 1978 ) and @xmath57 mag ( e.g. , lobel et al .  2003 ) , whereas star 4 , as a g - type star , corrected only for galactic extinction and the distance modulus , would be too faint , at @xmath69 mag .",
    "we therefore consider the possibility that star 4 is a yellow hypergiant to be unlikely .",
    "star 4 , however , also could be a reddened early - type supergiant .",
    "we have already pointed out the similarity of its spectrum to that of @xmath0 car , so it is plausible for us to assume that star 4 could be a lbv seen through appreciable extinction , as is the case for @xmath0 car . even with the color offset from the stellar tracks , the star s locus in figure 5 does , in fact ,",
    "appear consistent with a blue star experiencing an extinction of @xmath70 mag .",
    "we note that it is reasonable to assume that the reddening is variable across @xmath3118 pc at the sn site .",
    "unfortunately , we do not possess another observed color ( such as @xmath71 ) or stellar spectral features for these four stars to help break some of the degeneracy between the stars possible intrinsic colors and the amount of reddening in the environment .",
    "all four stars are somewhat redder in @xmath52 and/or bluer in @xmath53 than we might expect for the inferred stellar types , possibly due to underestimation of the uncertainties in the observed colors and to errors in the color transformation .",
    "( for stars 1 and 2 using , for example , synphot and the bpgs atlas , we can transform the flight system colors to @xmath722.3 and @xmath73 mag , putting the stars closer to the supergiant track . )",
    "although we can not readily account for the color offset for star 3 , at least some of the offset for star 4 ( @xmath74 mag ) from the supergiant track likely results from contamination of the continuum light in the broad f606w band by the significant emission at h@xmath20 .",
    "we can explore this further using synphot : normalizing a 32,000  k blackbody ( or , equivalently , a late o - type or early b - type supergiant ) spectrum to an unreddened f814w magnitude of 19.8 ( absolute magnitude @xmath75 for a luminous supergiant at the distance of ngc 2403 ) , then applying a reddening @xmath76 mag ( @xmath77 mag ) , and , finally , adding a synthetic ( gaussian - shaped ) h@xmath20 emission line with the characteristics of the observed emission line in figure 2 and the observed f658n magnitude for star 4 in table 2 , results in a good fit to the observations , to within the uncertainties , for the f475w , f606w , and f814w magnitudes of 24.13 , 23.09 , and 22.14 , respectively .    without the h@xmath20 emission in the model , the f475w and f814w magnitudes , of course , remain relatively unchanged ; however , the f606w magnitude is then 23.24 . following the transformations in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we find @xmath78 and @xmath79 mag .",
    "( the @xmath52 and @xmath53 colors , 0.95 and 1.30 mag , respectively , for the model derived using synphot are unaffected by the h@xmath20 emission , which is outside the @xmath18 passband . )",
    "these colors now place the locus of star 4 much closer both to the supergiant track and to being along the vector for a reddened luminous blue star .",
    "the h@xmath20 emission clearly leads through the bandpass tranformations to a redder @xmath52 and a bluer @xmath53 color ( exactly the trend seen in figure 5 ) than without the emission .    in light of these arguments",
    ", we consider it quite plausible that , like @xmath0 car , star 4 is a very luminous o - type or early - b star hidden behind a dusty ( @xmath70 mag ) shell or lbv - like nebula .",
    "we argue that this is the most likely scenario , given the star s brightness , color , and the characteristics of the h@xmath20 line emission . the shell , analogous to @xmath0 car s homunculus , was possibly ejected during the 1954 super - outburst .",
    "we therefore assume the unreddened colors for the model star , @xmath80 and @xmath81 mag , and the model extinction - free absolute magnitude , @xmath82 . including the measured uncertainties in the corresponding flight - system f475w@xmath83f606w and f606w@xmath83f814w colors and f606w magnitude from table 2 , we can place star 4 in color - magnitude diagrams shown in figure 6 , along with the possible properties of the other three stars in the environment .    for comparison",
    "we show in figure 6 stellar evolutionary tracks from lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) , with enhanced mass loss , for a range of stellar masses . at the position of sn 1954j / v12 in the galaxy ( @xmath84 from the nucleus , or galactocentric distance @xmath85 kpc ) the metallicity could be somewhat subsolar : from a study of the metallicity gradient in ngc 2403 by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the value of log(o / h)+12 at this distance is 8.6 dex , which is a factor 1.58 below solar metallicity ( the solar log(o / h)+12 abundance is 8.8 dex ; grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . however , the first available subsolar model tracks from lejeune & schaerer are for @xmath86 , which is a factor 2.5 below solar metallicity ( @xmath87 ) , and we consider this too low to adequately represent the sn 1954j / v12 environment .",
    "therefore , we choose the model tracks with solar metallicity ( although we note below the ramifications if we used the @xmath86 tracks instead ) .",
    "we conclude from figure 6 that stars 1 and 2 are either yellow supergiants of @xmath88 or , more likely , lower - mass ( @xmath89 , or @xmath90 for the @xmath86 track ) red supergiants , whereas star 3 could be a blue main - sequence dwarf with a range of possible ( likely , low ) masses .",
    "more importantly , we conclude that star 4 has a mass @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 for the @xmath86 track ; the mass is most constrained in figure 6b ) .",
    "unfortunately , the photometric uncertainties do not allow us to more rigorously constrain the mass of star 4 . however , the spectral and photometric similarities to @xmath0 car , and its implied high absolute @xmath18 magnitude , argue that the star s mass is likely closer to the upper range of massive stellar tracks shown in figure 6 .",
    "we therefore find it highly suggestive that this star is the very luminous , massive survivor of the sn 1954j / v12 eruption .",
    "what about the stellar environment of sn 1954j / v12 , relative to the environments of @xmath0 car and other lbvs ?",
    "how likely is it that these four stars constitute an association of massive stars spread over @xmath93 ( @xmath94 pc ) ?",
    "the star @xmath0 car is a member of the populous ob association trumpler 16 , part of a much larger ( @xmath95 pc ) site of intense massive star formation in the carina nebula ( walborn 1995 ) .",
    "p cygni appears to be a member of a rich young cluster @xmath96 pc northeast of the cluster ic 4996 and part of the larger cyg ob1 association ( turner et al .",
    "sn 1961v also sits in an environment of luminous , presumably massive supergiants over @xmath97 pc ( filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; van dyk et al .",
    "although not an @xmath0 car analog , sn 1987a arose from a high - mass blue supergiant and occurred in a loose , young ( age @xmath3112  myr ) cluster ( panagia et al .",
    "2000 ) ; its closest known companion is a coeval b2iii star ( scuderi et al .",
    "however , the lbv ag car does not seem to be associated with any cluster of luminous , massive stars over @xmath98 pc ( hoekzema , lamers , & van genderen 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , although the tendency is for the lbvs and @xmath0  car analogs to occur in rich , massive clusters spread over many pc , a range of environments exists for very massive stars .",
    "it is possible , then , for the four stars in the sn 1954j / v12 environment to be a sparse cluster of roughly coeval massive stars ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "what about the dusty nebula ?",
    "the profile of the source in the f658n image is unresolved ( @xmath311.5 wfc1 pixels fwhm ) , which implies a radius @xmath99 pc for the nebula . we can further constrain the size of the nebula from the luminosity in the h@xmath20 emission line and recombination theory , following wagner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . assuming an average @xmath100 erg s@xmath7 @xmath43 @xmath7 and equivalent width @xmath31240   for the line , and correcting for extinction using the relation @xmath101 ( viallefond & goss 1986 )",
    ", we derive an estimate of the h@xmath20 luminosity for the nebula @xmath102 erg s@xmath7 at the distance of ngc 2403 . assuming the same properties for this nebula as did wagner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the nebula around sn 2000ch , we find @xmath103 pc , comparable to ( within a factor of two of ) the size of @xmath0 car s homunculus ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "through imaging and spectroscopy obtained with the keck 10-m telescopes and imaging with the acs on - board _ hst _ , we have confirmed that the precursor star of sn 1954j / v12 in ngc 2403 has survived a super - outburst , analogous to the 1843 eruption of @xmath0 car .",
    "it is not a sn , in the classical sense , but an `` impostor '' masquerading as a sn .",
    "furthermore , the acs images , in combination with the keck spectroscopy , have revealed this quite rare @xmath0 car analog as a highly luminous , massive star ( @xmath2 ) , surrounded by a dusty , homunculus - like nebula .",
    "( based on this conclusion for sn 1954j , we also now consider it even more likely that the @xmath0 car - like star detected in the sn 1961v environment by chu et al .",
    "2004 is , in fact , the survivor of that event . )",
    "the fact that the sn 1954j / v12 super - outburst survivor has changed little in brightness and color over the last eight years implies that the star is now in a relatively quiescent state .",
    "its behavior in the recent past suggests that monitoring of the object should continue into the future , in order to understand more about this important , but rare , phenomenon in the evolution of massive stars .",
