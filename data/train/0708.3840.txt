    "since the unambiguous experimental realization in dilute ultra - cold atom cloud of the bose - einstein condensed phase ( bec)exp1,exp2,exp3,exp4,exp5,exp6,exp7 a lot of work has been devoted for searching the dynamic and physical properties of the nonlinear matter waves and excitations of the condensate .",
    "the observation of this effect in dilute atomic gases has allowed to invoke the weakly interacting mean field theory to describe the properties of the bec systems.@xcite hence , the dynamics of the process for the order parameter has been ruled by equations of nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type and mainly by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) . nowadays , nls equations with attractive ( negative scattering length@xcite ) and repulsive ( positive scattering length@xcite ) nonlinear interactions",
    "have been reported to describe experimental observations of different types of wave solitons.eiermann  most of the theoretical work has been devoted to implement numerical solutions of the gpe for the order parameter ( see ref . [ ] and references therein ) . to study and to control the physical properties of the condensate it will be very useful to manipulate analytical expressions for the chemical potential and for the order parameter as well .",
    "a typical example of the great physical interest is the attention devoted to the collective excitation spectrum of a bec . in this case",
    "we have to deal with the time - dependent gp equation under the linear response approximation . here , as input parameter , we have to insert in the bogoliubov equations@xcite the order parameter and the chemical potential solution of the nls . in that sense ,",
    "some analytical results for those magnitudes are priceless .",
    "also , many order problems can be stressed on the field of cold atoms bec as the dynamical stability , ruprecht atomic current in an optical lattice,@xcite etc .    in order to achieve closed solution",
    "the variational procedure with a gaussian as a trial wave function has been proposed ( see ref . [ ] and reference therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is well know that this ansatz does not reproduce well the properties of the condensate .",
    "for example , in the repulsive interaction case and in the strong nonlinear limit , the shape of the order parameter should be similar to the thomas - fermi ( tf ) solution ( see below eq .",
    "( [ tfwf ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , the results obtained with the standard variational procedure is , in many cases , qualitative and , even if the real shape of the wave function resembles the trial wave function , the variational method is not always a good reference for solving nonlinear equations.@xcite    nowadays , available numerical methods for solving differential equations are fast and accurate .",
    "nevertheless , if the evaluation of several physical magnitudes is carried out , such as the optical properties among others , or to control the properties of the condensate ( as we just discussed above ) , this advantage is lost due to cumbersome numerical computational procedures that must be performed at the end of the calculation . moreover ,",
    "if we work with a given basis of functions , it is difficult to know _ a priori _ if , in fact , the basis is a complete set for the hilbert space of the specific nonlinear equation .",
    "also , the type as well as the swiftness of convergence to the real solution is not always well established . in that sense , to implement manageable analytical expressions for the order parameter , where the accuracy and the absolute error of the obtained solution are controlled , has becomes a necessity .",
    "this is a fact in the study of nonlinear equation and in particular for the gpe .",
    "a description of the order parameter @xmath0 in terms of a controlled truncated basis becomes a useful tool if we are dealing with not many implemented functions and the degree of accuracy is well established .",
    "so , the obtained expansion will be given by a sum of few basic functions , allowing in that way to handle with explicit solution to describe the physical properties of the condensate .",
    "unfortunately , the beauty of such a mathematical result is restricted to certain range of values for the parameter involved in the nonlinear equation under study .",
    "the challenge is to find precisely this range of convergence , to give the absolute error in terms of physical parameters , and to provide other handled compact solutions outside the obtained range of the desire accuracy .",
    "we would like to remark that the most important requirements for analytical solutions are simplicity , flexibility , and the viability to be used in perturbation approaches for the calculations of physical properties .",
    "in this paper we present different methods of solutions of the time independent gpe based on the equivalent integral gpe  and its relation with the green function of the corresponding linear operator , on the soliton solution , and on a bright soliton - like variational function",
    ". this discussion will provide general analytical expressions for the order parameter and for the chemical potential in a universal range of the non - linear interaction parameter .    to describe the order parameter @xmath0 we started with the isomorphic one - dimensional nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe),groos1,pitaevskii which can be written as    @xmath4    with the normalization condition    @xmath5    in the above equation @xmath1 represents the chemical potential",

    "first we will study the variational method based on a soliton wave function as ansatz function , secondly we analyze the validity of the spectral method based on the equivalency between the integral and differential equation ( gp1 ) and the green function , solution of the linear harmonic oscillator operator .",

    "are of universal validity , giving an absolute estimation of the accuracy of each employed method as a function of a unique dimensionless parameter @xmath142 the present results teach us the way to get simple and exact analytical solutions for the gpe in the attractive interaction case in terms of @xmath142 indeed , for @xmath171 using a small base ( of the order of 50 oscillator wave functions ) we obtain an accuracy of @xmath158 for the chemical potential along with a minimum accumulated error , @xmath183 of 0.005 for the order parameter . for smaller values of @xmath2 the soliton solution ( [ so ] ) and ( [ soexa ] ) can be implemented as the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ gp1 ] ) . at this point , it is necessary to analyze the convergence to the exact solution provided by the series ( [ fi ] ) . in principle , as it was derived in sec .",

    "( [ gp1 ] ) independent of the sign of the non - linear interaction term .",
    "nevertheless , the number of the harmonic oscillator wave functions needed to reach the necessary convergence to the real solution depends on the values and sign of @xmath2 .",
    "the key point is to know when the series ( [ fi ] ) is really a good method for calculations and more efficient than the numerical ones . in our case , we selected 50 even functions @xmath185 reaching an accuracy for the chemical potential less than @xmath158 in the range @xmath186 to get the same accuracy for the chemical potential in the attractive region with @xmath172 it is necessary to deal with matrixes ( matriz ) of rank larger than 50@xmath17850 .    in order to clarify this peculiarity of the expansion ( [ fi ] ) we define",

    ", we represented the exact calculation of @xmath1 for each considered value of @xmath2 .",
    "it becomes clear that for the repulsive case , @xmath189 resembles the harmonic oscillator potential ( fig . 8 a ) ) and",
    "the chemical potential falls within certain range of the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues .",

    ", the effective potential becomes more localized as @xmath2 decreases and for @xmath190 @xmath191 the function @xmath189 does not resemble the harmonic oscillator potential , thus the values of the chemical potential are far away from @xmath192 eigenvalues . although the basis \\{@xmath64 } is complete , the number of functions @xmath64 needed to describe the order parameter @xmath16 and chemical potential @xmath1 with certain accuracy should increase enormously as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "this performance of the attractive interaction , determines that the green function solution or equivalently the galerkin or spectral method becomes computational expensive and the method is not adequate to describe the gpe for strong attractive interaction case , that is for @xmath193 .",
