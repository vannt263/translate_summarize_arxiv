    "that the properties of galaxies differ with environment has been recognized at least since hubble ( 1936 ) .",
    "that much of the difference between clusters and the field is of recent origin has been known since butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) .",
    "however the mechanisms that have produced these population differences are still in dispute .",
    "many processes have been suggested which are capable of transforming field  like populations into the predominantly early hubble types seen in clusters today .",
    "these include gas stripping by galaxy  galaxy collisions ( spitzer & baade 1951 ) , gas stripping by ram pressure from the intracluster medium ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , a shutoff in gas replenishment ( larson , tinsley , & caldwell 1980 ) , tidal shocks , either due to the cluster core ( byrd & valtonen 1990 , henriksen & byrd 1996 ) , to unvirialized subclusters ( gnedin 2003 ) , or to other galaxies ( richstone & malmuth 1983 , icke 1985 , moore 1996 ) , and galaxy - galaxy mergers ( dressler 1999 , van dokkum 1999 ) . since all these processes produce , by design , the same outcome , and have , again by design , a qualitatively similar dependence on environment , distinguishing between them is challenging at best . given that most extant observations consist of snapshots at one epoch of the cores of individual clusters , it is hardly surprising that the responsible process(es ) have still not been unambiguously identified .",
    "the imacs cluster building survey is an attempt to resolve this problem by following the evolution of galaxies as they move from the supercluster environment , through the infall stage and end finally with incorporation into the virialized central cluster .",
    "it takes advantage of the very wide field and high multiplexing of the imacs spectrograph on the baade telescope ( dressler 2011 ) , which allow one to observe , in one exposure , hundreds of galaxies over a 30   field , equivalent to a circle with radius of about 5 mpc surrounding a cluster at redshift 0.4 . the goal is to identify the changes that occur in galaxies as they move from field  like environments into increasingly dense and massive assemblies .",
    "the much longer baselines of time and environment which these data provide should help distinguish between the various candidate processes for transforming galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we describe the design and execution of the survey , up through the production of redshifts , luminosities , colors , masses , and star formation rates of galaxies .",
    "we describe new calibrations of star formation rates based on optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy and we discuss several methods for detecting starbursts using the available data .",
    "the immediately following papers ( dressler 2013- paper ii , oemler 2013- paper iii , gladders 2013- paper iv ) discuss certain aspects of the behavior of galaxies in the cluster and supercluster environment , and the evolution of the field galaxy population .",
    "two papers using icbs data to analyze environmental variations in the mass function of galaxies have already been completed ( vulcani 2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "future papers will address other aspects of both the field and cluster populations . throughout this and",
    "following papers we shall assume cosmological parameters of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "we wish to map a group of rich intermediate redshift clusters including still - forming objects unlikely to be discovered by x - ray searches .",
    "to do this we use the cluster red - sequence detection method ( gladders & yee 2000 ) , applied to data from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; gladders & yee 2005 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york 2000 ) data release 2 ( dr2 ) .",
    "the rcs data are @xmath3 and @xmath4 imaging to a depth sufficient to detect clusters to @xmath5 , more than sufficient to find clusters at the redshift considered here .",
    "the sdss data are much shallower , but sufficient to find rich / massive clusters at the redshift of interest .",
    "approximately 50 square degrees of the rcs imaging are readily visible from the las campanas observatory and we initially searched this area for candidate rich clusters in the desired 0.3@xmath60.5 redshift range .",
    "clusters were detected as over - densities on the sky and in color and magnitude space .",
    "the richest systems were considered as candidates for the icbs program . the lack of sufficient rcs imaging area visible from the southern hemisphere at @xmath7 to @xmath8 and @xmath9 to @xmath10 forced us to use the sdss dr2 data as a secondary source for rich cluster candidates . in order to ensure a reasonable match in mass between the two cluster sub - samples",
    ", we restricted our attention in the sdss to areas of low - extinction sky comparable in size to the rcs search area , at two ras selected to facilitate the extensive icbs data collection .",
    "the total comoving volume covered by this search is equal to that in the two galactic caps out to a redshift @xmath11 , and should , therefore , include a number of rich clusters comparable to those found in local surveys .",
    "we identified 5 fields which , from the rcs or from our analysis of the sdss data , appeared to contain very rich clusters at redshifts between 0.3 and 0.5 .",
    "preliminary spectroscopy showed that the cluster in one of the five fields was not sufficiently rich to be interesting , leaving 4 fields , two from the rcs and 2 from the sdss search , whose locations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "slit masks for each field were populated with objects from the photometric catalogs , with a slight preference for brighter objects and a strong preference for objects brighter than @xmath12 .",
    "after the first mask in each field , later masks contained unobserved objects plus a number of already observed objects , most with poor spectra plus some with adequate spectra to use for repeatability tests .",
    "most ( 39 slit masks ) spectroscopy was done with the full 30   field of the imacs @xmath13 camera on the baade telescope . however , in order to increase the fraction of objects observed in the cluster cores , where slit overlap issues make it particularly difficult to obtain adequate sampling , 3 masks were obtained using the gismo image slicer ( q.v .",
    "dressler 2011 ) on imacs , and 16 masks were obtained using the ldss3 spectrograph on the clay telescope , which has an 8.3   field .",
    "observations were done with a mixture of stare mode and nod  and  shuffle mode .",
    "typical total integration time per mask were in the range of 3 to 4 hours , divided into individual integrations of 30 to 45 minutes .",
    "all imacs and ldss3 spectroscopy , except for the ldp observations discussed below , were made at a dispersion of about 2   per pixel , resulting in a spectral resolution of about 6 .",
    "typical image quality during the spectroscopic and imaging observations was 0.60.8 .",

    "later observations were done with a filter limiting coverage to 4800   to 7800 .",
    "the shorter spectra allowed more spectra- about 300- to be packed onto a single mask , but lost coverage of the line at redshifts @xmath18 . in order to obtain observations of as many cluster galaxies as possible ,",
    "one mask per field was devoted to observations of already discovered cluster members through a 1000   wide filter centered on at the cluster redshift .",
    "one mask each was obtained in all fields except sdss1500 with the imacs low dispersion prism ( ldp ) . with a mean resolution @xmath19",
    ", the ldp spectra can not be used to measure individual line strengths , but are sufficient to obtain redshifts with a mean accuracy of about 0.01 . because the spectra are very short , of order 1000 objects",
    "can be observed on one slit mask , to a depth considerably fainter than with grism spectroscopy .",
    "more information about the ldp prism can be found in kelson ( 2012 ) .",
    "the data sets derived from all of these observations are referred to in the following as the icbs data sets . for calibration purposes",
    ", we also construct a local sample of galaxies with optical spectroscopy , and optical and 4 m infrared photometry .",
    "this sample consists of galaxies with sdss redshifts between 0.04 and 0.08 located in the three fields of the swire survey ( lonsdale 2003 ) which are within the sdss survey area .",
    "we take 4 m flux from the swire observations , and take spectra , redshifts and optical photometry from the sdss database .      with the exception of ldp observations , all imacs and ldss3 spectra",
    "were reduced using the cosmos data package ( oemler 2011 ) . in general , all observations of an individual mask , whether from one night or from several observing runs were combined into one stack of 2dimensional ( flux vs wavelength and slit position ) spectral images of individual slits . using the interactive spectral analysis program from the cosmos package ,",
    "a boxcar 1dimensional extraction of each spectrum was made .",
    "most spectra were extracted over a 1   length along the slit , but wider extractions were used for particularly diffuse galaxies .",
    "ldp spectra were reduced using the methods described in kelson ( 2012 ) .",
    "extracted 1dimensional slit spectra were turned into final calibrated spectra in a 3step process .",
    "firstly , spectra were put onto a relative flux scale by correcting for the instrumental response using observations of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "because the spectral response of imacs is very stable , a mean spectral sensitivity function for each instrumental setup was derived by combining all standard star spectra taken with this setup .",
    "secondly , spectra were corrected for atmospheric absorption using the sum of all of the spectra on each slit mask obtained on a given night . because the galaxies observed on most individual slit masks have a wide range of redshift and spectral type , the spectral features of the individual galaxies",
    "are averaged out in this summed spectra , leaving only the spectrum of the atmospheric absorption plus a slowly  varying sum of the individual ( redshifted ) continuum shapes .",
    "this spectrum , after removing the continuum variations , was divided into each galaxy spectrum to remove the atmospheric absorption .",
    "absorption corrections for spectra observed through one of the filters of cluster members could not be performed in this manner , since the wavelength range was too narrow and because all of the objects had similar redshifts .",
    "absorption corrections for these masks was performed using sky absorption spectra obtained from other observations of the same cluster .",
    "thirdly , the spectra are put on an absolute flux scale by scaling their values using the difference between the synthetic r magnitude calculated from each spectrum and the total r magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "assuming that there are no significant color gradients between the roughly 1   square area of the galaxy observed with imacs and the total galaxy , this corrected spectrum represents the total flux of the galaxy .",
    "we shall test this assumption later .",
    "after calibration , spectra of galaxies obtained from multiple slit masks were combined .",
    "we have found that better results were obtained if spectra were combined using a single weight for all data points in spectra from each slit mask , rather than using the pixel  to  pixel statistical weights obtained as part of the reduction process .",
    "relative weights varied by a factor of a few between the best and the worst slit masks .",
    "the final quality of the spectra is , of course , quite variable . a small fraction ( typically 20% )",
    "were too poor to yield a redshift . for the remaining , the median signal  to ",
    "noise ratio , per 2   pixel , at a rest wavelength of 4500 , ranges from 30 at @xmath20 to 7.5 at @xmath21 .",
    "redshifts of galaxies were measured using the cross - correlation method of kelson ( 2005 ) .",
    "analysis of repeat observations of galaxies show a typical error @xmath22 .",
    "this error is , to first order , independent of spectral type ( absorption or emission lines ) or galaxy brightness . it is larger than that expected due to the typical wavelength errors determined by measuring atmospheric emission lines @xmath23 , but is comparable to that expected due to slit errors .",
    "the location of spectra along the slits show a scatter about the expected position of about 1 pixel , equivalent to astrometric errors in the galaxy catalogs of @xmath24 .",
    "a scatter of 1 pixel in the centroid of the galaxies in the dispersion direction corresponds to a redshift error @xmath25 of @xmath26 .",
    "the completeness of the rcs1102 redshift sample , typical of all fields , is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the total completeness , shown by the black curve is the product of two factors : the fraction of objects observed , shown by the red curve , and the rate of success in obtaining redshifts from the spectra , shown by the green curve .",
    "although the success rate declines from almost 100% for the brightest objects to about 75% by @xmath27 , most of the incompleteness is due to object selection , which varies both with magnitude and with position with the field .",
    "the decline with magnitude in the fraction of objects observed , from about 70% for bright objects to 55% at @xmath27 , is completely due to the algorithm which selects objects to be included on a slit mask , and which has a mild preference for brighter objects .",
    "the spatial variation in completeness is small . because of the number of masks used in each cluster , and because a concerted effort was made to sample well the cluster core , there is very little under - sampling of objects in groups and the cluster .",
    "typically , what under - sampled regions exist lie near the periphery of the field .",
    "since it is generally easier to identify redshifts for galaxies with strong emission lines , we have checked for such a bias in our redshift catalog . to minimize evolutionary effects ( fainter galaxies tend to be at higher redshift , and star formation rates increase with redshift- q.v .",
    "paper iii ) , we examine the fraction of galaxies with @xmath28 ) \\ge 5\\aa$ ] in the redshift range @xmath29 .",
    "brighter than @xmath30 absorption spectra increase in frequency , because early  type galaxies dominate the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "however , between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the fraction of emission line galaxies is constant , demonstrating that any spectral type bias is minimal in our sample .",
    "emission and absorption lines in both the icbs and swire samples were measured using .",
    "this is a semi",
    " automatic process , in which gaussian profiles are fit to each line .",
    "the wavelength intervals of continuum side bands , and of the line itself , are specified in advance .",
    "however , one can interact with the fitting process to correct for less than perfect fits by altering any of the fitting parameters .",
    "output of the fitting includes equivalent widths of emission and absorption lines as well as fluxes of emission lines .",
    "because the spectra have previously been given an absolute calibration , the resulting fluxes represent the total line flux for the entire galaxy .    in fitting balmer emission lines , an attempt was made to properly set the continuum in the bottom of the stellar absorption line ; however , given the typical signal  to  noise ratios of these spectra , there is a limit to how well this can be done . when measuring the absorption line , no attempt was made to remove contamination from emission .",
    "because the line is often of marginal signal  to  noise ratio in these spectra , an improved measure of ew ( ) was constructed by combining the strength with that of the @xmath32 line , which lies on top of the ca h line .",
    "@xmath32 was determined from the difference between the ca k line and the ca h + @xmath32 equivalent width .",
    "empirically it was found that the equivalent width is related to that of h+@xmath32 and k as :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the difference , in angstroms , between the equivalent withs of h+@xmath32 and k. our final values are the average of and that derived from h and k.    the [ oii ] line lies in a rather clean spectral region and is easy to measure except for one complication . some galaxies ,",
    "even some with very strong [ oii ] , have a very weak stellar continuum at 3727 .",
    "slightly incorrect continuum levels in the reduced spectra due , for example , to sky subtraction errors , can result in quite large fractional changes in the continuum value , and therefore quite large errors in the equivalent width of [ oii ] . to avoid this problem",
    ", we define a pseudo  continuum at 3700   based on an empirical relation between 3700   flux and a combination of m(b ) magnitude and b - v color , derived from synthetic photometry of the swire sample of sdss spectra , and from this plus measured [ oii ] flux , determine ew([oii ] ) .",
    "the relation between synthetic and directly  measured ew([oii ] ) is presented , for the swire sample , in figure 2 ; a best fit to this relation is :    @xmath35 ) = -1.13\\times10^{-32 } l(oii)/10^{-0.4m37}\\ ] ]    where the 3700   monochromatic magnitude @xmath36 is approximated as    @xmath37    analysis of repeat measurements of individual galaxies show that and determinations have typical errors of 0.07 dex , and determinations have typical errors of 0.13 dex , however these errors are quite dependent on spectral quality .",
    "the icbs spectra are typically extracted from an aperture 1   square , equivalent to a 5.3 kpc square area in a @xmath38 galaxy .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the area containing the bulk of the stars of the typical luminous galaxy .",
    "since many of the galaxy parameters which we derive depend on an extrapolation from the spectroscopically observed area to the total galaxy , any systematic shift between line strengths in the galactic center to those of the entire galaxy could lead to systematic errors in , for example , star formation rates and internal extinction . to test for this ,",
    "we take 2-dimensional spectra from several of the best masks and construct synthetic spectra of an area 3   in diameter .",
    "figure 3 compares 1   and 3   measures of ew([oii ] ) and ew ( ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra are necessarily quite noisy , resulting in considerable scatter , but it is clear that there in no systematic trend of either with area , indicating that our measured line strengths are reliable indicators of the total galaxy values .",

    "the rcs0221 and sdss0845 fields were mapped by the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",

    "data were taken in guest observer program 40387 , pi dressler . including overheads , the observations lasted 11.7 hr per field .",
    "for each cluster , the circular 27  diameter imacs field of view was tiled with four overlapping mips raster - map photometry sequences .",
    "this covered the area more efficiently than would scan mapping . for almost all the imac field of view , at least two raster - maps overlap , providing @xmath40 exposure time per pixel for sdss0845 , and @xmath41 for rcs0221 .",

    "the sdss0845 catalogs were edited by hand to remove artifacts caused by this star and account for missing survey area obscured by the star . comparing object counts in our fields with the deep 4 m counts by papovich ( 2004 )",
    "we determine that our photometry is complete to about 60@xmath44jy , equivalent to a star formation rate of about @xmath45 at @xmath46 , with typical errors of about 15@xmath44jy .",
    "the star formation indicators available to us are the optical [ oii]3727 , , and emission lines , and the 4 m mid - infrared flux . in principle , the most direct measure of star formation rates comes from extinction  corrected hydrogen recombination lines ( see , e.g. kennicutt 1998a for a discussion of the general problem ) . however , our data is inadequate to determine reliable extinction corrections . of those methods available to us ,",
    "many studies have established that using the 4 m flux is the best choice .",
    "a number of empirical calibrations have been made of the correlation of star formation rate with infrared luminosity . since most of the mid  ir flux comes from warm dust heated by absorbed uv radiation from hii regions ( see e.g. wang & heckman 1996 ) , one would expect the best correlation to be between star formation rate and the ir bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , that is an observationally difficult quantity , and luminosities in either the iras 25 band or the spitzer 4 m band are more practical measures .",
    "most studies ( e.g. wu 2005 , calzetti 2005 , alonso - herrero 2006 , rieke 2009 ) have looked at correlations between bolometric or 4 m luminosities and other measures of star formation rates . among the most sophisticated analyses",
    "is that of rieke ( 2009 ) , who make use of spectral templates to predict 4 m bolometric corrections , as a function of ir luminosity and as a function of redshift .",
    "however , as perez - gonzalez ( 2006 ) have pointed out , the true expected correlation should be between ir luminosity and the _ absorbed _ rather than total uv luminosity , since only the former heats the dust .",
    "put another way , the correlation should be between the star formation rate and the sum of the ir luminosity and the _ escaped _ uv luminosity .",
    "perez - gonzales ( 2006 ) , calzetti ( 2007 ) , kennicutt ( 2009 , hereafter k09 ) and calzetti ( 2010 ) have all provided calibrations of this relation .",
    "all have substituted the easily  observed escaped flux for the unobserved uv flux in this analysis .",
    "this is not strictly correct , because the ratio of absorbed to escaped radiation is much higher in the uv than it is at .",
    "k09 argue that this discrepancy is compensated for by other factors .",
    "this is not necessarily true , but the k09 formulation , also used by calzetti ( 2010 ) is more convenient than a more strictly correct analysis , and the best test of its usefulness is the tightness of the correlation between predicted and true star formation rates .",
    "we shall use the relations between 4 m and luminosities and star formation rate given by equation 17 of calzetti 2010 , but with a slight modification to remove the discontinuities in their formulation at @xmath47 and @xmath48 . with this modification , and",
    "renormalizing to a salpeter imf , we have in this and all following equations for star formation rates , luminosities are in units of @xmath49 , star formation rates is in units of @xmath50 , and we assume a mass scale based on a salpeter imf .    at higher redshift",
    "the line is often not observable , and we have no measurements of it for about two thirds of our galaxy sample ; is the best substitute . although the relationship between line strength and star formation rate is more straightforward with the balmer lines than with , the higher  order balmer lines are both weaker than and also increasingly complicated by underlying stellar absorption lines .",
    "using instead of in the calzetti ( 2010 ) method should be equally good or better , since the extinction at is closer to that in the uv . using the data on normal galaxies from moustakas & kennicutt ( 2006 ) , as tabulated in table 2 of k09 ( hereafter called the k09t2 data set ) , as well as our own data , we find best consistency between sfr calculated from l(24 ) and l ( ) with that calculated from l(24 ) and l ( ) , with the following set of relations :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     this relation seems to be valid for galaxies at all redshifts and all 4 m luminosities within our samples .",
    "if mid  infrared photometry is not available , the only recourse is optical emission lines . in principle",
    ", one should be able to use line ratios to correct these lines for extinction , as has been used to obtain , e.g. @xmath51 for the k09t2 sample .",
    "unfortunately , this requires better data than is usually available for faint galaxies .",
    "experimenting with the icbs and even the swire data sets demonstrate that using balmer lines , or balmer to [ oii ] ratios to correct the optical line strengths only introduces noise , without improving either random or systematic errors in star formation rates . instead",
    ", we will derive empirical relations between observed line luminosities and star formation rates .",
    "in figure 5 we present the relation between star formation rate and _ observed _ luminosity , for galaxies , in the k09t2 sample , and in the swire and icbs samples , where star formation rates were calculated using equations 4 and 5 .",
    "all three data sets show a similar relation between sfr and l24 ; the best solution is shown by the green line .",
    "the scatter about the line has a dispersion @xmath52 for the k09t2 sample , and 0.25 larger for the noisier icbs data .    if is not observable , is the next best choice . in figure 6",

    "@xmath53    the scatter in the determined sfr is larger : @xmath54 for the k09t2 sample , somewhat larger for the icbs data .    finally ,",

    "the data is    @xmath55    the scatter for is @xmath56 for all samples .    it must be emphasized that all of these star formation rate calibrations , and particularly those using only one optical line or ir band , are only claimed to be valid for the star formation rates and galaxy types used in the calibration .",
    "however , the galaxy sets which we use should fairly sample normal luminous galaxies are redshifts @xmath57 .",
    "the similarity in the relations between , for example , the k09t2 and icbs galaxy samples , which contain galaxies at quite different redshifts , observed in very different manners , gives us some confidence that these calibrations are indeed appropriate for our sample , and for any of the other galaxy samples produced by surveys of the general galaxy population of the universe .",
    "they may or may not be equally applicable to unusual objects such as ulirg s , or to extreme dwarf galaxies , or to objects at very high redshift .",
    "for those galaxies with detected 4 m flux , and detected or flux , we can calculate @xmath58 , the extinction towards the emission line regions , from the ratio the star formation rate calculated from equations 4 or 5 , and that obtained from the same equations in the limit of @xmath59 , i.e. the case of zero extinction",

    "we call the v band extinction of the galactic stellar population , determined in this way , @xmath68 , and in figure 9 present , for the objects in figure 8 , the ratio of @xmath69 to @xmath68 , vs sfrm",
    ". this ratio of the extinction towards the stellar population to that towards emission line regions has been extensively studied by calzetti , who finds an average value of 0.5 ( calzetti 2001 ) . for those galaxies with well determined ratios ( i.e. those with significant values of a(v ) , there is a remarkably tight relation between @xmath70 and star formation rate per _ observed _ luminosity .",
    "galaxies with weak star formation have low ratios of @xmath70 , in other words most of the extinction is close to the hii regions , while , in galaxies with vigorous star formation the extinction is spread throughout the galaxy .",
    "there is a simple explanation of this .",
    "let us make two ( oversimplified ) assumptions : ( 1 ) all dust is associated with star  forming regions , and ( 2 ) the star  forming",
    "regions are distributed over the volume of the galaxy in the same way as the stars .",
    "therefore , the average path length for a photon exiting the galaxy will be the same for emission line and continuum photons . now , if @xmath71 is the number of star  forming regions along the line of sight of a photon departing the galaxy , then the number of dust clouds encountered by a photon from an hii region within a star  forming region on the way out of the galaxy is @xmath72 , while the number of dust clouds encountered by photons from a star in the general galaxy population is @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 , which goes from 0 for small @xmath71 to unity for large @xmath71 . while an undoubted oversimplification , a qualitatively similar trend must exist as long as some fraction of the galactic dust is associated with star  forming regions , which we know is true .",
    "the solid line in figure 9 is the relation : @xmath75      bell & de jong ( 2001 ) present simple prescriptions , based on bruzual & charlot population models , for determining the mass  to  light ratios of galaxies from optical broadband colors .",
    "as they point out , their prescription for rest frame b - v colors , for galaxies with a salpeter imf and solar metallicity : @xmath76 , has the great virtue that it is almost parallel to the standard reddening vector .",
    "thus , although mass  to  light ratios derived by this method are very sensitive to galactic extinction , _ masses _ are not since they are the product of two quantities , @xmath77 and @xmath78 with almost exactly inverse dependence of extinction .",
    "if the predictions of such population models are close to correct , our derived masses will be as well .",
    "the most important dependence in such models is on the initial mass function , and we make the same assumption in calculating masses- a salpeter imf , as we have made in calibrating star formation rates .",
    "rrrrrrr 0.00 - 0.25 & -4.23 & 34.64 & -121.05 & 220.29 & -197.31 & 69.03 + 0.25 - 0.55 & -1.60 & 6.85 & -9.35 & 5.22 & & + 0.55 - 1.00 & -1.78 & 8.14 & -12.41 & 7.28 & &    we use a variant of the bell & de jong approach , but calculate mass  to  light ratios using the delayed exponential models described in the previous section .",
    "we calculate the predictions at the epochs observed at redshifts between 0.0 and 1.1 ; the results are presented , in comparison with the bell & de jong prescription , in figure 10 .",
    "our results are similar to those of bell & de jong , but they vary with epoch , and a linear relation is not the best representation , instead , we use the polynomials of the form @xmath79 , with values of @xmath80 presented in table 2 .",
    "these polynomials do not reflect the full upturn seen in the models at the red end .",
    "this is deliberate ; given errors in the observed colors , a relation as steep as the model curves would produce much too large values of m / l for some galaxies .",
    "since these relations are not exactly parallel to the reddening vector , we correct both m / l and @xmath77  for extinction before calculating masses .",
    "if a continuum extinction values is not available for a galaxy , we assume a value @xmath81 . because the above relations are close to the reddening line , the effect of incorrect extinction values on the derived masses will be small .",
    "the role that starbursts might play in the evolution of galaxy populations , both in clusters and the field , has been a subject of considerable attention and controversy , at least since dressler & gunn ( 1983 ) .",
    "papers ii and iii of this series ( dressler 2013 , oemler 2013 ) will examine the evidence provided by this survey in some detail .",
    "the icbs data provide multiple means of detecting starbursts .",
    "we first reexamine the usual spectroscopic indicators .",
    "the equivalent widths of [ oii]3727   and have been used for many years as starburst indicators , ( e.g. dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 , dressler 1999 ) ; too strong an [ oii ] line can only be produced in galaxies during a starburst , and too strong an line is produced either during or after a starburst .",
    "we wish to recalibrate the threshold strengths of both lines which separate normal from bursting star formation , using stellar population models and empirical evidence .",
    "the behavior of is fairly simple to understand .",
    "its equivalent width is the ratio of the emission produced by hii regions to the nearby stellar continuum , to which stars of all ages contribute , but younger , hot stars contribute the most .",
    "dust extinction can only produce one possible effect : selectively diminishing the hii emission line strength relative to that of the more broadly distributed blue stars .",
    "figure 11 presents the ew([oii ] ) vs ssfr distribution of galaxies in the swire and k09t2 samples , and of icbs galaxies .",
    "the red lines are the predictions of the extinction  free delayed exponential models for normal galaxies at redshifts ( bottom to top ) of 0.0 , 0.5 , and 1.0 .",
    "these predictions can be taken as maximum allowed values of ew([oii ] ) , since selective extinction of star  forming regions , as described in section 3.1",
    "will generally reduce the observed value of ew([oii ] ) below its extinction  free value .",
    "we take as the threshold for starbursts the green line , which has the form @xmath28 ) = \\sum\\limits_0^n { { a_i}{{(\\log ( ssfr))}^i}}$ ] , with values of @xmath80 as presented in table 3 .",
    "necessarily an oii criterion for starbursts must miss a significant fraction of them , since objects which start off far from the green line may not cross the threshold during even a strong starburst .",
    "the effect of extinction on the line is more complex , and has been studied in some detail by poggianti ( 2001 ) . in a dust  free system",
    ", will be strongest in systems dominated by a stars- such as post  starburst galaxies in which the ob stars have died but the a stars have not . in systems dominated by older , cooler stars the line is weaker , in younger , hotter systems the line begins to be filled in by hii region emission .",
    "the effect of adding dust will depend on the relative distribution of dust , hii regions , a stars , and cool stars , and may either enhance or diminish the strength of the line .",
    "some starbursts are known with no visible optical emission lines but strong ( smail 1999 , dressler 2009b ) , presumably cases where the hii regions are heavily absorbed , but the a star products of the starburst have migrated away from the dustiest regions .    because of the complexities , a theoretical prediction of strength is impossible for any but dust  free systems . for galaxies with significant population",
    "i , an empirical determination is necessary .",
    "correlates equally well with strength and with broadband color ; we choose , following previous practice , to use . in figure 12",
    "we present the dependence of on ew([oii ] ) for galaxies in the swire and k09t2 samples . because there is no reliable theoretical prediction , and because the distribution is broad , we define a measure , which is the strength of relative to the line defined in figure 12 , with values , @xmath82 ; @xmath83 , and a linear increase between the two .",
    "crrrr @xmath84 & -10 & & & + @xmath85 & 3940 & 1126 & 123.2 & 4.033 + @xmath86 & -56 & & &    the quantity is a measure of the likelihood that an object is a starburst ; within the swire sample about 95% of objects have values of less than zero . as with our measure",
    ", the criterion will necessarily miss some fraction of starbursts in galaxies whose initial location in the -plane is far from the @xmath87 line .",
    "however , unlike our oii measure , there will be , at any positive value of , some chance that the object is _ not _ a starburst , but merely an outlier in the -distribution . for dust ",
    "free passive galaxies we can have more confidence ; theoretical models ( poggianti 1999 ) agree with empirical evidence that 3   is an upper limit to the strength of normal galaxies .",
    "larson & tinsley ( 1978 ) were the first to demonstrate that the color distribution of starburst galaxies is broader than that of normal objects . in figure 13",
    "we plot the distribution of rest frame b - v colors , corrected for extinction as described in section 3.1.2 vs ssfr for galaxies in the mk06 and swire samples , and , as a green line , our delayed exponential model predictions for a redshift of 0.0 .",
    "( at higher redshifts , the predictions for high values of ssfr move parallel to the @xmath88 locus , extending the line to higher ssfr s and bluer colors . )",
    "we have determined morphological classifications for as many as possible mk06 galaxies , using images from the nasa extragalactic database , and have identified agn s using the line strength criteria of kauffmann et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "galaxies which are morphologically and spectroscopically normal are displayed as large black circles , agn s and morphologically peculiar galaxies are displayed as red circles .",
    "swire galaxies , for which no morphology information is available , are shown as small blue circles .",
    "normal galaxies have a very tight distribution about the predicted relation , with @xmath89 . on the other hand , as larson & tinsley originally demonstrated , peculiar galaxies- almost all of which have morphological peculiarities suggestive of interactions , and therefore of starbursts , scatter more widely . the two black lines , containing the region of normal galaxies , have the following form , where @xmath90 :    @xmath91    objects beyond the region defined by these lines are presumed to be in some phase of a starburst .",
    "objects above the top line , with star formation rates too high for their colors , are likely young starbursts .",
    "those below the bottom line , with colors too blue for their star formation rates , are probably young post  starbursts .",
    "only about 1/3 of the morphologically  defined starburst candidates lie beyond the normal region . as with the previously defined oii and starburst indicators",
    ", color selection can only discover a fraction of starbursts .",
    "since most of the outliers have very high specific star formation rates , it will be predominantly the stronger starbursts which are detected by this criterion .",
    "figure 14 presents redshift - declination pie diagrams for galaxies in the 4 fields in the redshift interval 0.10 to 0.80 .",
    "the rcs0221 and sdss0845 fields each contain one dominant cluster , at redshifts near where the red cluster sequence cluster detection method predicted one to lie .",
