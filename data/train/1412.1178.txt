    "volatile elements , such as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulfur , and phosphorus , are important ingredients in the atmosphere and biosphere of planets .",
    "since molecules carrying these elements are readily found in the gas phase and/or ice mantles on dust grains in molecular clouds , the question is if and how they are delivered to protoplanetary disks and then to planets . in our solar system , the relative abundances of volatiles to water in comets are observed to be similar to those in interstellar ice , which suggests that interstellar ice could have been the raw material of the solar system , at least in comet forming regions ( @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", theoretical models of the chemistry in protostellar cores and in forming disks have been constructed by several groups .",
    "as the infall material enters the central regions of protostellar cores , complex organic molecules can be formed via grain - surface reactions on warm grains ( @xcite ) . in spherical symmetric models of a protostellar core",
    ", molecules are sublimated at their sublimation temperatures , forming an onion - like distribution of molecular abundances in the envelope ( e.g. @xcite ) . in axisymmetric core models , which can form disks",
    ", the temperature distribution is not spherically symmetric , and the chemical composition of an infalling fluid parcel depends on its trajectory ; if the fluid parcel experiences only low temperatures , a significant amount of interstellar ice can survive to reach the disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the infalling flow is usually supersonic , accretion onto protoplanetary disks is accompanied by a shock wave .",
    "the kinetic energy of the bulk flow is converted to thermal energy .",
    "while the gas is decelerated by the enhanced pressure at the shock front , the dust grains are not , and they fall into the disk .",
    "the dust grains are heated by gas drag and energy transfer from shock heated gas .",
    "the ice mantles are thermally sublimated ( e.g. @xcite ) and/or sputtered by collisions with gas particles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite investigated sublimation of volatiles by the drag heating in the primitive solar nebula .",
    "they showed that 90 @xmath8 of water ice is sublimated by the drag heating at the radius of 30 au .",
    "the water vapor then re - condenses onto the grain surfaces , because the solar nebula is cold .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , performed more general calculations of dense molecular shocks with pre - shock density @xmath9 @xmath3 and velocity @xmath10 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they obtained grain vaporization criteria for various grain materials such as water ice , organic refractory materials , silicate , and iron .",
    "observational studies on chemistry in these protostellar cores and disk forming stages have made significant progress in the last decades .",
    "various complex organic molecules ( coms ) are detected in hot corino sources , such as iras16293 - 2422 ( @xcite and references therein ) , while unsaturated carbon chains such as c@xmath11h and c - c@xmath12h@xmath13 are found in l1527 and iras15398 - 3359 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these emission lines are generally considered to originate in the warm envelope heated by the protostar(s ) , rather than accretion shock .",
    "@xcite found that c - c@xmath12h@xmath13 abundance is enhanced in the protostellar envelope at the radius of @xmath14 au , where the dust temperature reaches the sublimation temperature of ch@xmath11 .",
    "abundances of coms in hot corinos are derived by assuming a spherical envelope with radial gradients of density and temperature , although high - resolution observations have found more complex physical structures , such as infall , outflow and binarity ( ( e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite detected so gas towards l1527 . the position velocity diagram ( p - v diagram )",
    "indicates that so is located and rotating in a ring region at the centrifugal barrier of radius @xmath15 au .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath16 k ) derived from the lvg analysis of so lines is higher than the estimated sublimation temperature of so ( @xmath17 k ) , which indicates that so is desorbed to the gas phase at this radius . according to the theoretical models of protostellar cores ( @xcite ) ,",
    "so ice could indeed be abundant in infalling material .",
    "@xcite considered three possible desorption mechanisms : accretion shock in front of the centrifugal barrier , outflow shock , and protostellar heating .",
    "the compactness of the so emission and the p - v diagram indicate that the outflow shock could not be the major cause of the enhancement of so . with regards to the protostellar heating",
    ", @xcite constructed a detailed model of l1527 by solving radiation transfer and considering existing observational data in the infrared and radio wavelengths .",
    "the derived temperature at the radius of 100 au is about 30 k , which is in agreement with the excitation temperature of c - c@xmath12h@xmath13 ( @xmath18 k ) in the infalling gas at @xmath15 au @xcite .",
    "although contributions of the outflow shock and protostellar heating are not completely ruled out , the coincidence of the so emitting region with the centrifugal barrier is most naturally explained by so desorption via accretion shock .",
    "it should also be noted that the so emission detected towards l1489 irs shows a similar p - v diagram to that of l1527 @xcite .    if the so emission is really tracing the accretion shock onto the forming disk , it will have a significant impact on the studies of the physics and chemistry of disk formation .",
    "since the accretion flux is largest around the temporal centrifugal radius ( @xcite ) , so emission could be a useful probe of disk formation .",
    "chemical composition of the infall material might be altered at the accretion shock .",
    "although @xcite predicted that the vapor simply re - condenses in the disk , they did not include chemical reactions in their model .",
    "it is thus important to confirm if the warm so really originates in the accretion shock . on the observational side ,",
    "high resolution observations of the emission lines are desirable to distinguish which desorption mechanism , accretion shock , outflow shock , or protostellar heating , is responsible for the so emission around l1527 . on the theoretical side , it is useful to investigate the critical condition for so and other volatiles to be desorbed to the gas phase in the accretion shock .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the desorption of volatile species in the accretion shock onto protoplanetary disks .",
    "our goals are twofold : to investigate ( 1 ) if the so emission detected toward l1527 is consistent with an accretion shock model and ( 2 ) what other molecules can be detected in the accretion shock .",
    "we calculate the physical structure of a one - dimensional j - shock with pre - shock gas density and velocity relevant to disk formation .",
    "then we evaluate the drag heating of grains and a fraction of volatile molecules desorbed to the gas phase via thermal desorption and sputtering .",
    "while @xcite investigated a wide range of pre - shock velocity , we concentrate on low pre - shock velocities @xmath19 km s@xmath1 and investigate desorption of various volatile molecules which were not included in @xcite , in addition to water .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe our physical and chemical models . in  3 , we show the resultant shock structure and the fraction of volatiles sublimated as a function of pre - shock density and velocity .",
    "we also evaluate the column density of warm gas in the post - shock region . in  4 , we compare our model results with the observation of l1527 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "we investigate the accretion shock onto protoplanetary disk using 1d plane - parallel model .",
    "figure [ cal - picture ] schematically shows the configuration of our model .",
    "we consider a collision of gas flow with a rigid wall .",
    "this configuration also corresponds to the head - on collision between two gas flows with the same density .",
    "our calculations consist of two steps .",
    "firstly , we calculate the physical structure of the shock , i.e. density , temperature , and velocity of the gas .",
    "secondly , we calculate the dust velocity , temperature , and the desorption of ice mantles in the post shock region .",
    "we explain the basic equations in the following subsections .",
    "we perform one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we solve the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy :    @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the gas mass density , velocity , thermal pressure , ratio of specific heats , and cooling rate per unit mass , respectively .",
    "external heating , i.e. the protostellar heating , is not explicitly included in our model .",
    "it is , however , implicitly taken into account by setting the initial and minimum gas temperature ( see below ) .",
    "we use an operator - splitting technique to solve these equations , which are split into two parts : ( 1 ) ideal hydrodynamics , and ( 2 ) cooling ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the former is calculated by the second - order godunov method with lagrangian coordinates @xcite .",
    "we solve the exact riemann problem iteratively at each grid cell interface to calculate numerical fluxes , and determine the position of grid cell interface in the next time step .",
    "after solving ideal hydrodynamics , the energy equation @xmath28 is solved by the second - order explicit method .    in this work ,",
    "we consider high density gas ( @xmath29 @xmath3 ) accreting onto protoplanetary disk . at such high densities ,",
    "gas is cooled by gas - dust collisional cooling . referring to @xcite , the cooling rate per unit volume is @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are grain radius , number density of dust grain , boltzmann constant , and mean mass of gas particle , respectively . in this work , we set @xmath31 = 0.1 @xmath35 m , which is a typical grain radius in interstellar clouds ( @xcite ) , and the mean mass of gas is set to be @xmath36 g. @xmath37 is determined by the balance between heating and cooling : gas - grain energy transfer and cooling by thermal emission of dust ( see section 2.2 ) . at this stage",
    ", we neglect the relative velocity between gas and dust ; the heating rate of dust grains is given by equation ( [ gas - cooling ] ) .",
    "the dust temperature derived here is slightly different from the value obtained in section 2.2 .",
    ", where we take into account the gas - dust drag .",

    ", we set the minimum and initial gas temperature to be 20 k. we explore the parameter space of pre - shock number density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt this temperature and these densities for pre - shock gas referring to the recent three dimensional sph simulation of disk formation and evolution with radiation transfer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the assumed initial temperature is slightly lower than the envelope temperature of l1527 derived from the observation of c - c@xmath12h@xmath13 lines ( @xmath18 k ) ( @xcite ) and from radiation transfer modeling ( @xmath44 k ) ( @xcite ) .",

    "these velocities are chosen considering the spatial resolution of alma observation .",
    "the highest spatial resolution of line observation by alma is of order 0.1 arc second .",
    "if we consider the nearest star forming regions such as taurus , the spatial resolution is about 15 au .",
    "our numerical domain varies from 1.0@xmath47 pc to 2.0@xmath48 pc depending on the model parameters ( see table [ parameter ] ) .",
    "the numerical domain is divided into 450 grid cells with equal intervals .",
    "although our hydrodynamics code is time - dependent , we use it to obtain the steady state structure of 1d shock ; we run our code until the flow around the shock front reaches the steady state .",
    "while the gas is decelerated by shock , dust particle flows through the gas , and heated by the gas - dust collision . in the 1d steady state shock obtained in  2.1 .",
