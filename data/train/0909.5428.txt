    "in many ways , the early stages of galaxy - galaxy interactions are the easiest to identify and study .",
    "when they exist as a resolved pair , large samples of hundreds or thousands of pre - merger galaxies can be selected readily and objectively from a redshift survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique has a major advantage : subjective , morphological , and/or kinematic measures of whether two galaxies are merging are completely unnecessary . because the common indicators of interaction depend on merger stage and surface brightness , and because they can miss retrograde encounters and minor interactions , samples selected based on merger signatures are less complete than pair samples .",
    "unfortunately , pair samples include significant contamination from pairs that are physically well separated and seen projected , pairs that are not physically close but are part of the same larger group , and pairs that have not yet interacted . in @xcite , we use cosmological @xmath0-body simulation coupled with a semianalytic substructure model @xcite to explore the contamination inherent in pair samples selected from redshift surveys . here",
    ", we describe that technique and extend it to study star formation suppression in small groups .",
    "@xcite contains a detailed description of our technique for isolating triggered star formation in galaxy pairs .",
    "the essence of the approach is to identify galaxy pairs that are unlikely to be part of larger and more complex systems , to estimate the likely contamination from isolated galaxies seen in projection , and to identify an appropriate control sample of isolated galaxies for direct comparison .",
    "we use the cosmological model to understand galaxies in pairs .",
    "specifically , we create an artificial volume - limited redshift survey from the hybrid @xmath0-body simulation and substructure model by matching the abundances of simulated dark matter halos and sub - halos to the abundances of the galaxies in the redshift survey .",
    "this technique rests only on the assumption that galaxy luminosity depends monotonically on halo mass or , in our case , on the surrogate maximum circular speed of the simulated halo or sub - halo , v@xmath1 . for sub - halos , we use the circular speed of the dark matter halo at the time it fell into the parent halo",
    "because it is consistent with the two - point correlation function and pair counts statistics of existing redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sims]a employs this technique , showing the primary limitation of pair samples selected from redshift surveys . for a volume - limited sample that corresponds to @xmath2 in the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , we show that most galaxies in close pairs are actually members of larger groups of 3 or more galaxies . as a result , many galaxies in statistical pair samples are actually cluster or group galaxies , which likely have suppressed star formation for other reasons .",
    "this effect causes a strong and systematic underestimate of the aggregate amount of star formation in close galaxy - galaxy pairs .",
    "this effect , and not dust , is likely responsible for the result that somewhat widely separated pairs ( @xmath360 - 100 h@xmath4 kpc ) are actually _ redder _ than the field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we restrict the sample to galaxies with at most one neighbor within 700 h@xmath4  kpc on the sky and 1000  km s@xmath4 in redshift , however , as we do in fig .",
    "[ fig : sims]b , it becomes straightforward to identify isolated galaxy pairs . for pairs with separations @xmath5",
    "kpc , the contamination in the pair sample from isolated ( n  @xmath6 ) galaxies is @xmath7% and the contamination from systems with @xmath8 members is negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2df ] , we show the distribution of star - forming properties of isolated galaxies and isolated pairs measured via this technique from the 2df survey @xcite . the close ( @xmath5  h@xmath4 kpc ) pairs show a distinct , 14% excess of galaxies with high star formation rates . in @xcite , we show that the ability to measure this effect accurately depends dramatically on whether pairs in denser environments are removed from the sample .",
    "while close pairs are ideal for the study of triggered star formation , more widely separated isolated pairs reveal other group processes . most galaxies in systems with n  @xmath9 members have actually not had a recent close galaxy - galaxy pass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : passes ] , we use the simulation to compute the cumulative number of galaxies that have had a close pass `` recently '' ( 200 myr to 1 gyr ago ) , for two different halo masses ( or v@xmath1 values ) , corresponding to two different magnitude limits for the data . in both cases , the fraction of galaxies that have had a close pass is a strong function of the distance to their nearest neighbor , becoming @xmath10% for pair samples with maximum separations above @xmath11  @xmath12 h@xmath4 mpc . as a result ,",
    "more widely separated pair samples can be used to study whether the processes that cause the morphology - density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) operate in extremely sparse systems that have only two members .",
    "these processes include rapid quenching , where the cold gas is stripped directly from the system , and `` strangulation , '' where only the rarefied outer halo is removed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chris ] , we demonstrate the difference in color distributions between the wider pairs and isolated galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "the satellite galaxy is defined as the less luminous member of each pair ( @xmath13-band ) .",
    "the satellites show a slight blue excess , presumably due to triggered star formation , and a much stronger red excess due to quenching and/or `` strangulation . '' specifically , 21% more satellites than isolated galaxies are redder than @xmath14 , _ even when galaxies with the same stellar masses are compared . _",
    "thus , 21% of satellite galaxies in even the tiny n  @xmath15 systems have moved from the blue to the red sequence .",
    "at least some of the processes that give rise to the morphology - density relation operate in even very sparse groups .    the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : chris ] uses the simulation to measure the amount of time that the satellites ( subhalos ) have been substructure in these n  @xmath9 systems .",
    "almost independent of star formation history , it takes roughly 2 gyr to go from blue to red when star formation stops .",
    "if star formation ceased as soon as the galaxy became substructure , roughly @xmath360% of all satellites would have stopped forming stars . because @xmath377% were blue to begin with , roughly @xmath346% of the satellites would have moved from blue to red . because the number that have actually moved from blue to red is only 21% , we conclude that star formation continues well after a galaxy becomes substructure , for typically @xmath32 gyr .",
    "this analysis yields significant constraints on quenching and ram pressure stripping outside of the cluster environment @xcite .",
    "with present - day technology , the signatures of interaction are difficult to identify unambiguously at high redshift .",
    "new kinematic techniques enabled by adaptive optics and integral field unit spectrographs are effective ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these observations are limited to the brightest systems and do not reveal individual star - forming clusters . in the era of the next generation of large optical and infrared telescopes , adaptive optics and huge mirror sizes will allow a very detailed identification of merging systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmt ] , we present a simulation of the antennae galaxies observed with the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) and the infrared imaging spectrograph ( iris ) , which is planned to work with adaptive optics at first light .",
    "the observation reveals individual superstar clusters even at @xmath16 , and likely beyond , allowing very detailed kinematic and metallicity maps of the galaxy .",
    "we would like to thank our collaborators , risa h. wechsler and andrew r. zentner , for allowing us to quote these results prior to publication .",
    "we would also like to thank brad whitmore for sharing his reduced h@xmath17 image of the antennae ."
