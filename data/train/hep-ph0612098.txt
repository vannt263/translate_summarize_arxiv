    "the absorption probability and the propagation speed of polarized light propagating in a magnetic field depends on the relative orientation between the polarization and the magnetic field .",
    "these effects are known as vacuum magnetic dichroism and birefringence , respectively , resulting from fluctuation - induced vacuum polarization .    in a pioneering experiment ,",
    "the bfrt collaboration searched for these effects by shining linearly polarized laser photons through a superconducting dipole magnet .",
    "no significant signal was found , and a corresponding upper limit was placed on the rotation ( dichroism ) and ellipticity ( birefringence ) of the photon beam developed after passage through the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , a follow - up experiment done by the pvlas collaboration reported the observation of a rotation of the polarization plane of light after its passage through a transverse magnetic field in vacuum  @xcite . moreover , preliminary results presented by the pvlas collaboration at various seminars and conferences hint also at the observation of an ellipticity ( birefringence )  @xcite .",
    "these findings have initiated a number of theoretical and experimental activities , since the magnitude of the reported signals exceeds the standard - model expectations by far .",
    "if the observed effects are indeed true signals of vacuum magnetic dichroism and birefringence and not due to a subtle , yet unidentified systematic effect , they signal new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .    one obvious possible explanation , and indeed the one which was also a motivation for the bfrt and pvlas experiments , may be offered by the existence of a new light neutral spin-@xmath0 boson @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this possibility has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the conclusion that the rotation observed by pvlas can be reconciled with the non - observation of a rotation and ellipticity by bfrt , if the hypothetical neutral boson has a mass in the range @xmath2  mev and a coupling to two photons in the range @xmath3  gev@xmath4 .",
    "clearly , these values almost certainly exclude the possibility that @xmath1 is a genuine qcd axion @xmath5  @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "a mass @xmath6mev implies a peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite breaking scale @xmath7gev . since , for an axion , @xmath8 of electromagnetic and color anomalies in order to arrive at an axion - photon coupling in the range suggested by pvlas",
    "this is far away from the predictions of any model conceived so far .",
    "moreover , such a new , axion - like particle ( alp ) must have very peculiar properties  @xcite in order to evade the strong constraints on its two photon coupling from stellar energy loss considerations  @xcite and from its non - observation in helioscopes such as the cern axion solar telescope ( cast )  @xcite .",
    "a light scalar boson is furthermore constrained by upper limits on non - newtonian forces @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative to the alp interpretation of the pvlas results was proposed  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the observation that the photon - initiated real and virtual pair production of millicharged particles ( mcps ) @xmath9 in an external magnetic field would also manifest itself as a vacuum magnetic dichroism and ellipticity . in particular ,",
    "it was pointed out that the dichroism observed by pvlas may be compatible with the non - observation of a dichroism and ellipticity by bfrt , if the millicharged particles have a small mass @xmath10  ev and a tiny fractional electric charge @xmath11 . as has been shown recently  @xcite",
    ", such particles may be consistent with astrophysical and cosmological bounds ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , if their tiny charge arises from gauge kinetic mixing of the standard model hypercharge u(1 ) with additional u(1 ) gauge factors from physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "this appears to occur quite naturally in string theory  @xcite .",
    "it is very comforting that a number of laboratory - based low - energy tests of the alp and mcp interpretation of the pvlas anomaly are currently set up and expected to yield decisive results within the upcoming year .",
    "for instance , the q&a experiment has very recently released first rotation data @xcite .",
    "whereas the q&a experimental setup is qualitatively similar to pvlas , the experiment operates in a slightly different parameter region ; here , no anomalous signal has been detected so far .",
    "the interpretation of the pvlas signal involving an alp that interacts weakly with matter will crucially be tested by photon regeneration ( sometimes called `` light shining through walls '' ) experiments  @xcite presently under construction or serious consideration  @xcite . in these experiments ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ph_reg ] ) , a photon beam is shone across a magnetic field , where a fraction of them turns into alps .",
    "the alp beam can then propagate freely through a wall or another obstruction without being absorbed , and finally another magnetic field located on the other side of the wall can transform some of these alps into photons  seemingly regenerating these photons out of nothing .",
    "another probe could be provided by direct astrophysical observations of light rays traversing a pulsar magnetosphere in binary pulsar systems  @xcite .",
    "clearly , photon regeneration will be negligible for mcps .",
    "their existence , however , can be tested by improving the sensitivity of instruments for the detection of vacuum magnetic birefringence and dichroism  @xcite",
    ". another sensitive tool is schwinger pair production in strong electric fields , as they are available , for example , in accelerator cavities  @xcite .",
    "a classical probe for mcps is the search for invisible orthopositronium decays  @xcite , for which new experiments are currently running  @xcite or being developed  @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", the two scenarios are substantially different : the alp scenario is parameterized by an effective non - renormalizable dimension-5 operator , the stabilization of which almost inevitably requires an underlying theory at a comparatively low scale , say in between the electroweak and the gut scale .",
    "by contrast , the mcp scenario in its simplest version is reminiscent to qed ; it is perturbatively renormalizable and can remain a stable microscopic theory over a wide range of scales .",
    "the present paper is devoted to an investigation of the characteristic properties of the different scenarios in the light of all available data collected so far .",
    "a careful study of the optical properties of the magnetized vacuum can indeed reveal important information about masses , couplings and other quantum numbers of the potentially involved hypothetical particles .",
    "this is quantitatively demonstrated by global fits to all published data . for further illustrative purposes , we also present global fits which include the preliminary data made available by the pvlas collaboration at workshops and conferences .",
    "we stress that this data is only used here to qualitatively demonstrate how the optical measurements can be associated with particle - physics properties .",
    "definite quantitative predictions have to await the outcome of a currently performed detailed data analysis of the pvlas collaboration .",
    "still , the resulting fit regions can be viewed as a preliminary estimate of `` target regions '' for the various laboratory tests mentioned above . moreover ,",
    "the statistical analysis is also meant to help the theorists in deciding whether they should care at all about the pvlas anomaly , and , if yes , whether there is a pre - selection of phenomenological models or model building blocks that deserve to be studied in more detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec2 ]",
    "we summarize the signals for vacuum magnetic dichroism and birefringence in presence of axion - like and millicharged particles .",
    "we use these results in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] to show how the different scenarios can be distinguished from each other and how information about the quantum numbers of the potential particle candidates can be collected . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we start here with some general kinematic considerations relevant to dichroism and birefringence , which are equally valid for the case of alp and the case of mcp production .",
    "let @xmath12 be the momentum of the incoming photon , with @xmath13 , and let @xmath14 be a static homogeneous magnetic field , which is perpendicular to @xmath12 , as it is the case in all of the afore - mentioned polarization experiments .",
    "the photon - initiated production of an alp with mass @xmath15 or an mcp with mass @xmath16 , leads , for @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively , to a non - trivial ratio of the survival probabilities @xmath19 of a photon after it has traveled a distance @xmath20 , for photons polarized parallel @xmath21 or perpendicular @xmath22 to @xmath14 .",
    "this non - trivial ratio manifests itself directly in a dichroism : for a linearly polarized photon beam , the angle @xmath23 between the initial polarization vector and the magnetic field will change to @xmath24 after passing a distance @xmath20 through the magnetic field , with @xmath25 here , @xmath26 are the electric field components of the laser parallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field , and the superscript `` 0 '' denotes initial values . for small rotation angle @xmath27 , we have    @xmath28    we will present the results for the probability exponents @xmath29 for alps and mcps in the following subsections .    let us now turn to birefringence .",
    "the propagation speed of the laser photons is slightly changed in the magnetic field owing to the coupling to virtual alps or mcps .",
    "accordingly , the time @xmath30 it takes for a photon to traverse a distance @xmath20 differs for the two polarization modes , causing a phase difference between the two modes , @xmath31 this induces an ellipticity @xmath32 of the outgoing beam , @xmath33 again , we will present the results for @xmath34 for alps and mcps in the following subsections .",
    "a neutral spin-0 particle can interact with two photons via @xmath35 if it is a scalar , or @xmath36 if it is a pseudoscalar . in a homogeneous magnetic background @xmath37 , the leading order contribution to the conversion ( left half of fig .",

    "we conclude that a careful determination of the signs of ellipticity and rotation in the case of a positive signal can distinguish between spinor and scalar fluctuating particles . in eq .  . in the sense of classical optics , this can be either sign depending on the initial photon polarization relative to the magnetic field . in this work ,",
    "the notion of the sign of rotation therefore refers to the two experimentally distinguishable cases of either @xmath102 or @xmath103 . ]",
    "finally , let us briefly comment on the case of having both fermions and bosons .",
    "if there is an identical number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom with exactly the same masses and millicharges , i.e. if the millicharged particles appear in a supersymmetric fashion in complete supersymmetric chiral multiplets , one can check that the signals cancel .",
    "an exactly supersymmetric set of millicharged particles would cause neither an ellipticity signal nor a rotation of the polarization and one would have to rely on other detection principles as , for example , schwinger pair production in accelerator cavities @xcite .",
    "however , in nature supersymmetry is broken resulting in different masses for bosons and fermions .",
    "now , the signal typically decreases rather rapidly for large masses ( more precisely when @xmath104 becomes smaller than one ) and the lighter particle species will give a much bigger contribution .",
    "accordingly , for a sufficiently large mass splitting the signal would look more or less as if we had only the lighter particle species , be it a fermion or a boson .",
    "in principle , one can set up a series of different experiments distinguishing between the different scenarios , alps or mcps .",
    "for example , a positive signal in a light - shining - through - wall experiment @xcite would be a clear signal for the alp interpretation , whereas detection of a dark current that is able to pass through walls would be a clear signal for the mcp hypothesis @xcite .",
    "but even with a pvlas - type experiment that measures only the rotation and ellipticity signals , one can collect strong evidence favoring one and disfavoring other scenarios .",
    ".summary of the allowed particle - physics interpretation arising from a sign analysis of birefringence induced by different refractive indices @xmath69 and dichroism induced by different probability exponents @xmath65 .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     performing one measurement of the absolute values of rotation and ellipticity , one can typically find values for the masses and couplings in all scenarios , such that the predicted rotation and ellipticity is in agreement with the experiment .",

    "a measurement of the sign of either the rotation or the ellipticity is sufficient to decide between a scalar or pseudoscalar . measuring",
    "the sign of both signals already is a consistency check ; if the signal signs turn out to be inconsistent , the alp scenarios for both the scalar and the pseudoscalar would be ruled out . in the mcp scenario",
    ", a measurement of the sign of rotation decides between scalars and fermions .",
    "if only the sign of the ellipticity signal is measured , both options still remain , since the sign of the ellipticity changes when one moves from large to small masses : the hierarchy of the refractive indices is inverted in the region of anomalous dispersion .",

    "because of the negative sign of the birefringence signal , only the large-@xmath79/small-@xmath160 branch remains acceptable for the fermionic mcp , whereas the small-@xmath79/large-@xmath16 branch is preferred by the scalar mcp , cf .",

    "comparison between the fermionic mcp ( @xmath140d.o.f.@xmath161 ) and the scalar mcp ( @xmath140d.o.f.@xmath162 ) points to a slight preference for the scalar mcp scenario .",
    "this preference is much more pronounced in the fit to the pvlas data ( published + preliminary ) only , cf . table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the best mcp candidate would therefore be a scalar particle with mass @xmath163  ev and charge parameter @xmath164 .",
    "let us first stress that the partly preliminary status of the data used for our analysis does not yet allow for a clear preference of either of the two scenarios , alp or mcp .",
    "based on the published data only , the alp scenarios give a better fit , since the upper limits by bfrt and q&a leave an unconstrained parameter space open to the pvlas rotation data .",
    "by contrast , the bfrt and q&a upper limits already begin to restrict the mcp parameter space of the pvlas rotation signal in a sizable manner , which explains the better @xmath155/d.o.f .",
    "for the alp scenario .",
    "based on the ( in part preliminary ) pvlas data alone , the mcp scenario would be slightly preferred in comparison with the alp scenario , see table [ tab2 ] , bottom row .",
    "the reason is that the pvlas measurements of birefringence and rotation for the different laser wavelengths show a better internal compatibility in the scalar mcp case than in the scalar alp scenario .",
    "the signal observed by pvlas  a rotation of linearly polarized laser light induced by a transverse magnetic field  has generated a great deal of interest over the recent months .",
    "since the signal has found no explanation within standard qed or from other standard - model sectors , it could be the first direct evidence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the proposed attempts to explain this result fall into two categories : + 1 .",
    "conversion of laser photons into a single neutral spin-0 particle ( scalar or pseudoscalar ) coupled to two photons ( called axion - like particle or alp ) and + 2 .",
    "pair production of fermions or bosons with a small electric charge ( millicharged particles or mcps ) .",
    "+ the corresponding actions associated with these two proposals should be viewed as pure low - energy effective field theories which are valid at laboratory scales at which the experiments operate .",
    "a naive extrapolation of these theories to higher scales generically becomes incompatible with astrophysical bounds . in this paper",
    ", we have compared the different low - energy effective theories in light of the presently available data from optical experiments .",
    "we have summarized the formulas for rotation and ellipticity in the different scenarios and contributed new results for millicharged scalars .",
    "we have then studied how optical experiments can provide for decisive information to discriminate between the different scenarios : this information can be obtained in the form of size and sign of rotation and ellipticity and their dependence on experimental parameters like the strength of the magnetic field , the wavelength of the laser and the length of the magnetic region .",
    "our main results are depicted in figs .",
    "[ alpfit ] and [ mcpfit ] which show the allowed parameter regions for the different scenarios . on the basis of the published data",
    ", none of the scenarios can currently be excluded .",
    "the remaining open parameter regions should be regarded as good candidates for the target regions of future experiments . as the preliminary pvlas data illustrates , near future optical measurements",
    "can further constrain the parameter space and even decide between the different scenarios .",
    "for instance , a negative ellipticity @xmath156 together with a rotation corresponding to probability exponents @xmath102 would rule out the scalar or pseudo - scalar alp interpretation altogether .",
    "be it from optical experiments like pvlas or from the proposed `` light / dark current shining through a wall '' experiments , we will soon know more about the particle interpretation of pvlas .",

    "since the sign of the ellipticity signaling birefringence can be a decisive piece of information , distinguishing between the spin properties of the new hypothetical particles , let us check our results with the effective - action approach @xcite . since the formulas in this appendix are equally valid for the mcp scenario as well as standard qed , we denote the coupling and mass of the fluctuating particle with @xmath165 , or @xmath166 , and @xmath167 with the dictionary : @xmath168    the effective action in one - loop approximation can be written as @xmath169=s_{\\text{cl}}[a]+\\gamma^1[a ] = -\\int_x \\mathcal f + \\gamma^1[a ] , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the field - strength invariant @xmath170 corresponding to the maxwell action .",

    "next we turn to the effective action which is induced by charged scalar fluctuations , i.e. , the heisenberg - euler effective action for scalar qed .",

    "expanding the scalar - induced action to quartic order in the field strength results in @xmath187 where the constant prefactors this time read @xmath188 the velocities of the two polarization modes then results in @xmath189 this time , the @xmath97 mode is significantly slower than the @xmath180 mode , since the order of the coefficients is now reversed @xmath190 .    in a birefringence experiment ,",
    "the induced ellipticity in the two cases is different in magnitude as well as in sign . already at this stage",
    ", we can expect that the same difference will also be visible in the dichroism . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the slower mode necessarily has to exhibit a stronger anomalous dispersion . by virtue of dispersion relations",
    ", we can expect that this goes along with a larger attenuation coefficient . as a result",
