    "noma has been recognized as a promising band efficient candidate for 5 g wireless systems @xcite .",
    "different from conventional orthogonal multiple access ( oma ) such as time - division multiple access ( tdma ) , noma exploits the power domain to serve multiple users simultaneously . early work on noma has mainly focused on the enhancement of spectral efficiency .",
    "in@xcite , different cooperative noma schemes have been investigated , respectively , for improving transmission reliability .",
    "in@xcite , resource allocation has been considered in a relaying system using the noma principle .",
    "in@xcite , multiple - antenna technologies have been used to further improve the performance of noma systems .    due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications , information exchange between transceivers is vulnerable to eavesdropping , which poses a challenge to realize secure wireless transmission .",
    "recently , physical layer security , which achieves secure transmissions by exploiting the dynamics in the physical layer , has drawn considerable attention@xcite .",
    "naturally , this new concept of security can be applied to noma in order to realize robust secure transmission .    in this letter , we investigate the maximization of the secrecy sum rate ( ssr ) of a siso noma system , where each user has a predefined quality of service ( qos ) requirement . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first effort to study physical layer security in noma .",
    "we firstly identify the feasible region of the transmit power for satisfying all users qos requirements .",
    "then we derive the closed - form expression of an optimal power allocation policy that maximizes the ssr .",
    "numerical results are provided to show a significant ssr improvement by noma compared with conventional orthogonal multiple access ( oma ) .",
    "consider a downlink system consisting of a transmitter , @xmath0 legitimate users and a passive eavesdropper .",
    "each node in the system is equipped with a single antenna .",
    "the channel gain from the transmitter to the @xmath1-th user is denoted by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rayleigh fading channel gain , @xmath4 is the distance between the @xmath1-th user and the transmitter , and @xmath5 is the path loss exponent .",
    "similarly , the channel gain from the transmitter to the eavesdropper is modeled as @xmath6 .",
    "the instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) of each user is known at the transmitter while that of the eavesdropper is unknown . without loss of generality ,",
    "the channel gains can be sorted as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the number of the legitimate users whose channel gains are not greater than that of the eavesdropper .",
    "it should be pointed out that the transmitter neither knows @xmath9 nor @xmath8 .    employing the noma scheme@xcite ,",
    "the transmitter broadcasts a linear combination of @xmath0 signals to its users .",
    "the transmitted superposition signal can be expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the message for the @xmath1-th user , @xmath12 denotes the total transmit power , and @xmath13 represents the power allocation coefficient , i.e. , it is the ratio of the transmit power for the @xmath1-th user s signal to the total transmit power @xmath12 .",
    "each user has a predefined qos requirement , which demands the transmitter to send the message to each user with a minimum data rate , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the eavesdropper tries to intercept all legitimate users messages .",
    "the users apply the successive interference cancellation ( sic ) to decode their own signals : the @xmath1-th user will first detect the @xmath14-th user s message , @xmath15 , and then eliminate this message from its observed mixture , in a successive way .",
    "the @xmath14-th user s message , @xmath16 , will be treated as noise .",
    "thus , the achievable rate of the @xmath1-th user , @xmath17 , is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the power of additive noise .",
    "we denote @xmath20 as the achievable rate of the eavesdropper to detect the @xmath1-th user s message .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the secrecy rate of the @xmath1-th user and the ssr , respectively .",
    "in this work , we make a pessimistic assumption that the first @xmath23 users messages have already been decoded before the eavesdropper tries to decode the @xmath1-th user s message , which overestimates the eavesdropper s capability .",
    "thereby , @xmath22 given below serves as a lower bound on the ssr correspondingly .",
    "then , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be given by    [ ree ] @xmath24^+,\\\\      & r_s = \\sum\\nolimits_{m=1}^{m}r^m_s,\\label{rso }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively , where @xmath25^+\\triangleq \\max(0,\\cdot)$ ] .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath26 when @xmath27 @xcite , making @xmath21 be zero when @xmath28-th user , @xmath28 , should be guaranteed by using conventional cryptography implemented at upper layers . ] .",
    "then , @xmath22 can be rewritten as @xmath29",
    "in this section , we propose a power allocation policy to maximize the ssr of the system subject to all users qos requirements .",
    "particularly , the closed - form expressions for the optimal power allocation coefficients @xmath30 , which maximize the ssr , are derived analytically .",
    "we denote @xmath31 as the minimum data rate required by the @xmath1-th user and then the qos constraints are characterized as @xmath32 which can be retransformed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "then , the ssr maximization problem can be formulated as    [ see_mv_original ] @xmath35    due to the qos requirements , there must exist a minimum transmit power , denoted by @xmath36 , that satisfies all users qos requirements . then problem ( [ see_mv_original ] ) is feasible only when @xmath37 . as a result , it is important to identify the feasible region of the transmit power before dealing with problem ( [ see_mv_original ] ) .",
    "let @xmath38 represent the power of the @xmath1-th user s signal , then the problem of seeking out @xmath36 is formulated as    [ minp ] @xmath39    where @xmath40 and ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) is from the qos constraints ( [ rmqm ] ) .",
    "[ theo1 ] the objective function in ( [ ob rmqm2 ] ) is minimized when all the constraints in ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) are active .",
    "we prove this theorem by contradiction .",
    "suppose that a set of transmit power of all users signals @xmath41 is the optimal solution to problem ( [ minp ] ) with at least one constraint in ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) inactive .",
    "without loss of generality , we suppose that the @xmath42-th constraint in ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) is inactive , i.e. , @xmath43 now , we create a new set @xmath44 by defining @xmath45 for @xmath46 while @xmath47 is set to the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ proof_contra ] ) . observing the structure of the constraints ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) , we find out that the rhs of ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) , for an arbitrary @xmath1 , is a monotonically non - decreasing function of @xmath48 for @xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "the setting of @xmath47 , whose value is less than @xmath50 , ensures that all the constraints in ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) hold for the newly created set @xmath44 .",
    "however , with the definition of @xmath44 , we can obtain @xmath51 , which contradicts to the assumption that @xmath41 is the optimal solution to problem ( [ minp ] ) .",
    "thereby , we conclude that all the constraints in ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) must be active for minimizing ( [ ob rmqm2 ] ) and thus the proof is complete .    note that when all the constraints in ( [ c rmqm2 ] ) are active , the optimal solution to problem ( [ minp ] ) , denoted by @xmath52 , can be calculated sequentially in the order @xmath53 , since @xmath54 is determined by @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a deterministic quantity .",
    "then , we have @xmath57 and the feasible region of the transmit power is @xmath37 .",
    "having obtained @xmath36 , we are going to deal with the ssr maximization problem in ( [ see_mv_original ] ) given @xmath37 . by substituting ( [ rm ] ) and ( [ re ] ) into ( [ rs ] ) , @xmath22 can be reformulated as follows .",
    "@xmath58.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for notational simplicity , we define @xmath59 then @xmath60 in ( [ proof1_rs ] ) can be recast as @xmath61    after the reformulation , we can see that problem ( [ see_mv_original ] ) has two important properties : 1 ) the objective function @xmath22 is the sum of @xmath62 non - convex subfunctions with a uniform expression ; and 2 ) the arguments @xmath63 are coupled with each other in the constraints ( [ rmqm2 ] ) in a complicated way .    in the following we propose an algorithm to solve problem ( [ see_mv_original ] ) by exploiting the properties of the optimization problem .",
    "our basic idea is : we firstly solve the maximization problem of each subfunction @xmath64 for @xmath65 individually subject to the constraints ( [ gammaequ1 ] ) .",
    "then we prove that the set of the optimal solutions to each maximization problem possesses a _ unique common solution_. in other words , we can find a unique solution that simultaneously maximizes @xmath64 for each @xmath1 from @xmath8 to @xmath66 and satisfies all the constraints in ( [ gammaequ1 ] ) , which consequently solves the problem . more specifically ,",
    "let @xmath67 represent the set of the optimal solutions that maximize @xmath64 subject to all the constraints in ( [ gammaequ1 ] ) , where @xmath65 , then our goal is to prove @xmath68 , where @xmath30 is the unique common solution of the @xmath62 optimization problems .",
    "we now solve these optimization problems .",
    "we first transform the original problem of maximizing @xmath64 by using its monotonicity .",
    "the first - order derivative of @xmath64 is given by @xmath69 this indicates that @xmath64 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the maximization of @xmath71 is equivalent to the maximization of @xmath70 .",
    "then , the @xmath62 optimization problems mentioned above can be uniformly formulated as    [ op_uniform ] @xmath72    problem ( [ op_uniform ] ) is solved by the following proposition .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal solution to problem ( [ op_uniform ] ) is that both the constraints in ( [ gamma_condition1 ] ) for @xmath73 and the constraint ( [ gamma_condition3 ] ) are active .",
    "the closed - form solution to problem ( [ op_uniform ] ) is given by    [ cfs_prop ] @xmath74}{2^{q_i}},~ 1\\leq i\\leq m.\\label{calculate gamma}\\\\      & t_m=1-\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{m}\\gamma_i.\\label{calculate tm }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      supposing @xmath81 and setting @xmath82 in ( [ kkt_lambda ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 substituting ( [ v_lambda ] ) into ( [ kkt_lambda ] ) yields @xmath84 obviously , ( [ v_mu ] ) implies that @xmath85 for @xmath86 , because @xmath81 and @xmath87 can be calculated sequentially in the order @xmath88 .",
    "however , under the condition that @xmath85 , @xmath86 , we set @xmath89 in ( [ kkt_lambda ] ) and then obtain @xmath90 , which contradicts to ( [ v_lambda ] ) obtained using the assumption @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath80 and @xmath91 which indicates the inequality constraint ( [ gamma_condition3 ] ) must be active .    we then substitute ( [ v_t_lambda ] ) into ( [ kkt_lambda ] ) for @xmath86 and obtain @xmath92 which demonstrates that @xmath93 for @xmath86 , since @xmath77 is a positive number according to ( [ lambdan0 ] ) and ( [ v_t_lambda ] ) .",
    "thereby , the constraints in ( [ gamma_condition1 ] ) are active when @xmath86 .    in order to obtain the closed - form solution of problem ( [ op_uniform ] )",
    ", we replace @xmath94 with @xmath95 in ( [ gamma_condition1 ] ) since ( [ gamma_condition3 ] ) is proved to be active . setting the constraints in ( [ gamma_condition1 ] ) active for @xmath73",
    ", we have the expressions of @xmath96 and of @xmath70 given by ( [ calculate gamma ] ) and ( [ calculate tm ] ) , respectively . according to ( [ calculate gamma ] )",
    ", @xmath97 can be obtained by recursive calculation in the order @xmath98 .",
    "thereby , the closed - form expression for the optimal solution , which maximizes @xmath70 , can be obtained when both the constraints in ( [ gamma_condition1 ] ) for @xmath73 and the constraint ( [ gamma_condition3 ] ) are active .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "based on proposition 1 , which solves problem ( [ op_uniform ] ) with the closed - form solution given by ( [ cfs_prop ] ) , the following theorem gives the unique solution for maximizing @xmath22 .",
    "the unique optimal power allocation coefficients @xmath30 , which maximize @xmath22 , are given by @xmath99}{2^{q_m } } ,          & 1\\leq m < m,\\vspace{4pt}\\\\         1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}\\gamma_i^{\\textrm{opt}},&m = m .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ]    according to proposition 1 , when both the constraints in ( [ gamma_condition1 ] ) for @xmath73 and the constraint ( [ gamma_condition3 ] ) are active , the arguments @xmath96 are uniquely determined with the formulas ( [ calculate gamma ] ) .",
    "this implies that more power allocation coefficients are uniquely determined with the growth of @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the size of the set of the optimal solutions to problem ( [ op_uniform ] ) , i.e. , @xmath100 , becomes smaller as @xmath1 increases , which can be characterized as    @xmath101    accordingly , @xmath102 is the set of the optimal solutions that simultaneously maximize @xmath64 for @xmath65 , which consequently solves problem ( [ see_mv_original ] ) . by setting @xmath103 in the closed - form solution provided by ( [ cfs_prop ] ) in proposition 1 ,",
    "the first @xmath66 arguments @xmath104 are uniquely determined with the formulas ( [ calculate gamma ] ) in the order @xmath105 and the last argument @xmath106 is uniquely determined with @xmath107 since the constraint ( [ gamma_condition3 ] ) has been proved to be satisfied at equality .",
    "thus the proof is complete .",
    "the analysis above demonstrates that with @xmath37 , the optimal power allocation policy for maximizing the ssr of the noma system is to use the extra power @xmath108 only for increasing the @xmath0-th user s secrecy rate .",
    "this is because the @xmath0-th user has the best channel condition and thereby it is most likely to improve the ssr of the system .",
    "that is why the terms @xmath109 and @xmath8 do not appear in the closed - form solution given by ( [ gammamaxs ] ) , namely , the proposed power allocation policy does not need the eavesdropper csi .",
    "in this section , we provide numerical results to demonstrate the ssr performance of the noma system by using the proposed power allocation policy .",
    "a tdma system , where the time slots with equal duration are allocated to users individually , is used as a benchmark .",
    "we randomly generate 50,000 channel realizations with parameters @xmath110 , @xmath17 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 m , @xmath17 , and @xmath113 dbm .",
    "particularly , when the value of the transmit power @xmath12 is not in the feasible region , the transmitter will not send the messages .",
    "in other words , when @xmath12 is not large enough to satisfy all users qos requirements , we set @xmath22 to zero .    fig . [",
    "fig : see_p ] shows the average ssr versus the transmit power .",
    "one can see that noma outperforms conventional oma and the performance gain becomes more significant as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is because , a higher diversity gain is offered when @xmath0 is large , and higher spectral efficiency is achieved when more users are served simultaneously .",
    "[ fig : ssr_qos ] shows the effect of the qos requirements on the ssr performance .",
    "we can see that the ssr decreases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "this is because , the increase of @xmath31 requires the transmitter to use the extra power for improving the data rate of the users with poor channel conditions , which will obviously deteriorate the ssr performance .",
    "further , as @xmath31 becomes very large , the ssr approaches zero , since @xmath12 is not large enough to satisfy all users qos requirements and then the transmitter does not send the messages to the users .",
    "in this letter , we studied physical layer security in a siso noma system , in which each legitimate user has a predefined qos requirement .",
    "we firstly identified the feasible region of the transmit power for satisfying all users qos requirements .",
    "then , the optimal power allocation policy for maximizing the ssr was obtained in closed - form expressions .",
    "numerical results showed that noma has the superior ssr performance compared with conventional oma and the performance gain is more significant as the number of users increases .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the highly demanding qos requirements will degrade the ssr performance of the system .",
    "one promising future direction is to adopt multiple antenna settings to further enhance the security of noma systems",
