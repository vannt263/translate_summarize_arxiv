    "the calice collaboration  @xcite is a group of 140 people from 24 institutes in europe , us and asia .",
    "the collaboration is planning a beam test program starting in 2004 to study both electromagnetic ( ecal ) and hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeters for a future linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "the ecal will be a silicon - tungsten sandwich sampling calorimeter  @xcite and there are various options under investigation for the hcal , namely using tile scintillators with analogue readout  @xcite or rpcs or gems with digital readout  @xcite as the sensors .",
    "the main driver for these choices is the requirement of fine granularity for the `` energy flow '' algortihms used to obtain the jet resolutions necessary for lc physics  @xcite .",
    "the beam test program will test the ecal and all versions of the hcal in an integrated data acquisition system so the data from both calorimeters can be analysed together .",
    "it is planned to do a systematic study of the dependence of the shower structure on particle energy , type and incident angle , as well as adding a `` preshower '' in front of the calorimeter to generate narrow cones of particles to simulate jets .",
    "the total number of different configurations which will be tested is of order @xmath0 , and to see the fine detail required , of order @xmath1 events is estimated to be needed for each configuration .",
    "the calice beam test ecal will consist of 30 layers of silicon and tungsten .",
    "each silicon layer comprises nine wafers , each being a @xmath2 array of diode pads and each of these is a readout channel .",
    "this gives 324 channels per layer , or 9720 channels in total .",
    "these need to be read for every event , preferably without any threshold or other data suppression so as to allow pedestal and noise studies offline .",
    "the signals expected in the diodes range from the energy deposited by one minimum ionising particle ( mip ) to around 1000 mips in the core of high energy electron showers , a range of 10 bits . the intrinsic noise from the on - detector preamplifier  @xcite is expected to be equivalent to around 0.1 mip or less .",
    "it is of interest to measure this noise level , so the dynamic range required is 14 bits in total . at the highest energies of around 1000 mips ,",
    "the resolution is degraded if the precision is below a mip , so 10 bits of precision are required",
    ". the on - detector preamplifier has a cr - rc shaper with a peaking time of 180ns .",
    "this defines the trigger latency needed to ensure the waveform is sampled at this peak .",
    "a trigger jitter of 10ns is acceptable ; this leads to a maximum shift below the peak of 0.1% , which is within the 10 bits precision requirement .",
    "it consists of 15 identical readout boards and a single trigger board .",
    "the readout boards handle the on - detector preamplifier signals and all digitisation for two layers of the ecal , or 648 channels .",
    "these signals are received on six cables per readout board .",
    "each cable connects to an electrically independent on - detector board which holds the preamplifier and which handles three silicon wafers of 108 channels .",
    "the trigger board is a simple board to prevent further triggers until readout is complete and to distribute the trigger and the system clock across the backplane to the readout boards .",
    "it contains very few components and will not be described further below .",
    "an schematic diagram of the readout board is also shown in figure  [ fig : overview ] .",
    "the board is controlled by a `` master fpga '' which handles the vme interface and distributes the clock and trigger from the backplane across the board .",
    "it interacts with the `` slave fpgas '' by distributing configuration data ( written to the board via vme ) and collects the event data prior to vme readout .",
    "there is one slave fpga for each cable from the on - detector electronics and so six per readout board .",
    "each operates independently of the others although they contain identical firmware so , in standard operation , they would effectively be synchronised together .",
    "the slave fpgas send the control and timing signals needed by the on - detector electronics and receive six analogue signal lines .",
    "the 108 channels are multiplexed onto these six lines , with 18 channels per line .",
    "the slave fpgas control six 16-bit , 500khz adcs , one per signal line .",
    "the extra bits give robustness against loss due to non - optimal range matching .",
    "the adc speed results in a time to digitise all 18 channels of less than 50@xmath3s , or only 5% of the allowed 1ms event time .",
    "the trigger is also distributed to the on - detector electronics via the slave fpgas , rounded to a 100 mhz clock , giving the required 10ns maximum jitter .    to save any parallel development of similar electronics for the tile hcal option , the on - detector electronics for",
    "this system is attempting to become similar enough to the ecal such that the same readout boards could be used for both .",
    "there will be around 1500 channels in the tile scintillator hcal .",
    "the 16-bit adc would be more than ample for the range and precision required and would result in 3kbytes per event .",
    "the number of channels multiplexed per board for the hcal is also not known , so it is not clear how many extra readout boards would need to be fabricated .",
    "however , it is clear that a common solution would save significant effort and is being actively pursued by the groups involved .",
    "the maximum rate of data readout over vme is around 30mbytes / s . for a desired 1khz rate , this implies the event size needs to be below 30kbytes .",
    "there will be no threshold suppression of the data on the readout board , so the ecal data size will be 19kbytes per event .",
    "both options of the hcal will be around 3kbytes and the size of any beam monitoring , particle idenitification and trigger data are uncertain , but likely to be around 1kbyte .",
    "hence , the total event size should be around 25kbytes .",
    "this makes a 1khz peak rate tight but not impossible .",
    "the readout board vme interface will be optimised for speed , using dma transfers and asynchronous vme access .",
    "a fallback solution will be to split the system between two or more crates , with two vme - pci bus convertors ."
