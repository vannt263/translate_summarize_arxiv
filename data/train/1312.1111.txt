    "antiferromagnetic interactions between the spins carried by magnetic ions placed on a nonbipartite lattice ( like the triangle lattice or the kagome lattice ) are competing , i.e. , frustrated . the zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field introduces even more competition . as a result , the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on a low - dimensional nonbipartite lattice in a magnetic field provides an excellent playground for the study of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and frustration . in such systems",
    "new phenomena may emerge .",
    "therefore , the study of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets attracts much attention nowadays.@xcite interestingly , in some cases frustrated quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets admit a rather detailed study of their low - temperature properties at high magnetic fields , namely for the so - called localized - magnon systems which have a dispersionless ( flat ) lowest magnon band.@xcite it has been shown that the localized - magnon systems in the high - field low - temperature regime may be understood using specific methods of classical statistical mechanics.@xcite however , this classical description of the localized - magnon quantum spin systems was developed under the assumption of the so - called ideal geometry , i.e. , the conditions for localization of the magnon states are strictly fulfilled ( i.e. , the lowest magnon band is strictly flat ) . as a rule , this assumption is violated in real - life systems .",
    "hence , the case of nonideal geometry , when the localization condition is ( slightly ) violated , is more relevant from the experimental point of view .",
    "there were several papers related to this nonideal situation,@xcite which , however , did not use the localized - magnon paradigm .    ) .",
    "the trapping cells for localized magnons ( squares ) are indicated by bold red lines ( @xmath2 bonds).,width=321 ]    recently@xcite we have developed a systematic treatment of a certain class of localized - magnon systems , namely the monomer class,@xcite to consider small deviations from ideal geometry .",
    "in particular , we have investigated the antiferromagnetic quantum heisenberg model in a field on the diamond chain , the dimer - plaquette chain , and the square - kagome lattice ( for the latter lattice see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "we mention that all of these models of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets have attracted attention previously as strongly frustrated quantum spin systems , and they were investigated by various authors also at zero or moderate fields , where the localized - magnon scenario is not relevant , see refs .  .",
    "inspired by the situation in the diamond - chain like compound azurite,@xcite in ref .",
    "it was assumed that @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "fig .  [ fig01 ] ) that we will call azurite - like geometry .",
    "for that type of exchange geometry , by eliminating high - energy degrees of freedom , we constructed several low - energy effective hamiltonians which are much simpler to treat than the initial ones .",
    "thus for the @xmath5-site frustrated square - kagome lattice with the azurite - like deviation from ideal geometry@xcite we obtained the hamiltonian of the @xmath6-site ( @xmath7 ) unfrustrated square - lattice ( pseudo)spin-1/2 @xmath0 model in a @xmath1-aligned magnetic field .",
    "then we performed exact - diagonalization studies for the obtained effective model of @xmath8 sites ( corresponding to @xmath9 sites for the initial square - kagome system ) to discuss the low - temperature properties of the spin-1/2 square - kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet in a field .",
    "the most intriguing feature that we found in ref .",
    "is the existence of a magnetic - field driven berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition at low temperatures .",
    "the aim of the present paper , which continues the preceeding study@xcite with a special focus on the square - kagome system , is three - fold .",
    "first , we will provide effective hamiltonians for a general exchange coupling scheme , see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , going beyond the the azurite - like geometry .",
    "( besides , we will report in appendix  [ a ] similar results for the one - dimensional diamond - chain case . )",
    "second , instead of the exact - diagonalization method that is restricted to small systems only , we now present data obtained by quantum monte carlo simulations for the effective model of much larger size up to @xmath10 sites ( corresponding to @xmath11 sites for the initial square - kagome system ) . based on these data we are able to make more precise predictions for the high - field low - temperature properties of the square - kagome quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet , in particular , for the phase diagram of the model .",
    "third , we will provide a more detailed discussion of the bkt phase transition which may occur in the square - kagome quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet emphasizing some tasks for further studies .",
    "in this paper , we consider the standard spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic isotropic heisenberg model in a magnetic field with the hamiltonian @xmath12 here the first sum runs over all nearest - neighbor bonds on the square - kagome lattice , whereas the second one runs over all @xmath5 lattice sites .",
    "it is convenient to label the sites by a pair of indeces , where the first vector index @xmath13 enumerates the @xmath7 unit cells and the second one enumerates the position of the site within the unit cell , see fig .  [ fig01 ] . since @xmath14=0 $ ] , the eigenvalues of @xmath15 are good quantum numbers .",
    "we consider magnetic fields in the vicinity of the saturation field @xmath16 .",
    "for the ideal geometry , when @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 . then for @xmath19 the ground state is the fully polarized ferromagnetic state , and the band of the lowest - magnon excitations is dispersionless ( flat ) .",
    "an eigenstate from this band can be written as a localized - magnon state,@xcite where the spin - flip ( magnon ) is trapped on a square ( trapping cell ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . owing to the localized nature of these states the many - magnon states in the subspaces",
    "@xmath20 can be constructed by filling the traps by localized magnons .",
    "clearly , all these states are linear independent.@xcite moreover , these localized - magnon states have the lowest energy in their corresponding @xmath15-subspace , if the strength of the antiferromagnetic bonds of the trapping cells @xmath2 exceeds a lower bound.@xcite the degeneracy of the localized - magnon states is calculated via mapping of these states onto spatial configurations of hard monomers on an auxiliary square lattice.@xcite at low temperatures and for magnetic fields @xmath21 around the saturation field @xmath22 the contribution of localized - magnon states dominates the partition function.@xcite    in what follows we consider the most general violation of the ideal geometry by allowing that all values of @xmath23 are different , see fig .  [ fig01 ] .",
    "however , we assume that the deviations from ideal geometry are not too large , i.e. , perturbation theory is applicable . to derive the effective hamiltonian",
    "we follow closely the lines given in ref .  .",
    "at high fields considered here , only a few states of the trapping cell are relevant , namely , the fully polarized state @xmath24 with the energy @xmath25 and the one - magnon state @xmath26 with the energy @xmath27 .",
    "all other sites carry fully polarized ( i.e. , @xmath1-aligned ) spins . decreasing the magnetic field from @xmath19 to @xmath28 , in the case of ideal geometry ,",
    "the ground state of the cell undergoes a transition from the state @xmath29 to the state @xmath30 at the saturation field @xmath31 .",
    "therefore it is a reasonable approximation to take into account further only these 2 most relevant states @xmath29 and @xmath30 for each square instead of the complete set of 16 states of a square . according to ref .",
