    "several recent financial disasters have made clear the necessity for a diverse set of risk management tools .",
    "traditional models of risk management often rely on trivial probabilistic tools and often fail to relax key assumptions for the underlying statistics .",
    "an effective tool for risk management should be a withstanding measure of uncertainty robust to a large set of situations . moreover , it should be suitable for its users , adaptive to complex situations , and compatible for various sample sizes .",
    "risk management is not simply a tool to establish the upper bound on a loss , but also a preventative measure that should lead to the development of an informed decision - making process .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    perhaps the most well known tool for risk management amongst finance practitioners is value at risk ( var ) .",
    "conceptually , var measures the supremum of a portfolio s loss with a particular level of confidence .",
    "consider a portfolio of unitary value with an annual standard deviation of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 daily var is simply the product of the daily standard deviation and the total value , or @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath0 daily var of 0.3525 means that , if our day were hypothetically conducted an infinite number of times , the loss of our one dollar portfolio would be greater than 0.3525 with probability 0.05 .",
    "we say with @xmath0 confidence that on a given day , the maximum loss implied by var is 0.3525 for the one dollar portfolio .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    a more rigorous definition of var is a particular quantile of future portfolio values , conditional on current information . in particular",
    ", we say that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a time t return , @xmath5 is the set of available information in a weak sense , and @xmath6 is the confidence level or probability .",
    "the immediate considerations for a functional model include a closed - form representation , a set of well - defined intermediary parameters , and a test to validate the proposed model . in advance of our model proposition(s ) , we will review and evaluate existing models for var .    [ [ section-2 ] ]    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii will introduce and evaluate existing models for value at risk , all of which will guide us in constructing caviar .",
    "section iii will cover the notion of conditional autoregression , the understanding of which is critical to realistic non - i.i.d processes .",
    "section iv will introduce various methods of testing quantile regression , which will enable us to compare the set of well - known models with ours .",
    "section v will focus on the empirical test of caviar on ibm , gm , and spx time series data .",
    "we will conclude with section vi .",
    "var has become a quintessential tool for portfolio management because it enables funds to estimate the cost of risk and efficiently allocate it .",
    "moreover , a growing number of regulatory committees now requires institutions to monitor and report var frequently .",
    "such a measure discourages excessive leverage and increases transparency of the `` worst - case scenario '' .",
    "while var , methods of estimation vary across both markets and firms . for ease and convenience of terminology",
    ", we will refer to all institutions and funds concerned with monitoring var as `` holders '' .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    one component that often varies between different var models is the method by which the distribution of portfolio returns is estimated .",
    "a rudimentary example was readily introduced at the beginning of the paper , in which returns were assumed to be independently and identically distributed , or i.i.d .",
    "as we will see , however , returns almost never follow a martingale process , but rather , are markov . a portfolio s performance on any given day almost always effects the performance on subsequent days .",
    "thus , the probability of observing a specific return or variance as an event is dependent on the probability of observing the same event one period prior .",
    "the calculation of returns falls within two categories :    1 .",
    "* factor models : * here , a universe of assets are studied for their factors , all of which are correlated .",
    "thus , the time variation in the risk of the portfolio is derived from the volatility of the correlations .",
    "a well known example is the fama - french four - factor model .",
    "the approach , however , assumes that negative returns follow the same approach as non - negative returns .",
    "perhaps an even more alarming assumption by such models is the homoscedasticity between returns per unit risk .",
    "* portfolio models : * here , var is instantaneously constructed using statistical inference of past portfolios .",
    "then , quantiles are forecast via several approaches , including generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ( garch ) , exponential smoothing , etc .",
    ", most of which incorrectly assume normality .",
    "moreover , the set of models assume that after a certain amount of time , a particular historical return has probability zero of recurring .",
    "we can deduce without an empirical demonstration that that portfolio models will underestimate var after time t , and factor models will fail to account for autoregression .",
    "interestingly enough , the last decade has motivated the introduction of extreme quantile estimation , and the notion of asymptotic tail distributions .",
    "many of these models , however , are only representative of especially low ( @xmath7 ) quantiles , and do not relax the weak i.i.d . assumption .",
    "we now address many of the concerns above with caviar .",
    "in particular , we will study the asymptotic distribution , account for autocorrelation , and do so under various regimes .",
    "suppose that there exists an observable vector of returns , @xmath8 .",
    "we denote @xmath9 as the probability associated with the value - at - risk . letting @xmath10",
    "be a vector of time t observable variables ( i.e. returns ) , and @xmath11 be a vector of unknown parameters , a conditional autoregressive var model may take the following form :    @xmath12    * interpretation : * + the quantile of portfolio returns at a time t is a function of not only the past period returns , but also the past period quantile of returns .",
    "that is , @xmath13 . the lag operator in the third term , l ,",
    "links the set of available information at @xmath14 to the quantile of returns at t. the autoregressive function , @xmath15 , creates a smooth path between time - oriented quantiles .",
    "the first term , @xmath16 , is simply a constant .",
    "the example provided at the beginning of the paper , which does not account for autoregression , would simply remain a constant : @xmath17 .",
    "now that we have developed an understanding of the basic form for a caviar model , we will explore a few examples .      in general",
    ", an adaptive model follows the form @xmath18^{-1}-\\theta \\}\\ ] ] the adaptive model successfully accounts for increase in expected var . whereas the traditional model would change only with a change in portfolio value , the adaptive model increases the value - at - risk by unit one whenever it is exceeded",
    "moreover , it decreases var by unit one if initial estimates proved to be too high .",
    "it is clear to see that such a conditional adjustment , in the form of a step function , would provide for a more accurate myopic estimation .",
    "however , because all changes are of magnitude one , the adaptive model overlooks large deviations in returns upwards or downwards .",
    "for example , consider a state in which the portfolio halved in value for three consecutive days . while the portfolio has been left at an eighth of its value ,",
    "the var only increased by three units from its value at t=0 .",
    "the sav model takes the form @xmath19 the sav is an autoregressive model in which a change in returns , regardless of direction , results in a change in var .",
    "what is particularly useful about this model is its ability to generalize movement in portfolio value .",
    "however , it is because of this very feature that sav should not be used as a primary tool for measurement .",
    "consider a series of large deviations in portfolio value , alternating upwards and downwards .",
    "while the long - run change in value is zero , the var implied by sav would be unrealistically high .",
    "similarly , a series of small deviations would imply an unrealistically low var .",
    "the as model takes the form @xmath20 the as model is intended to capture the asymmetric leverage effect .",
    "specifically , it was designed to detect the tendency for volatility to be greater following a negative return than a positive return of equal magnitude .",
    "the model relies on magnitude of error , rather than squared error , as in garch .",
    "the indirect garch model takes the form @xmath21 while the garch model is estimated by maximum likelihood , indirect garch is estimated via quantile regression .",
    "thus far , we have understood the general form of a conditional autoregressive value at risk model , and have also seen several possible forms .",
    "the primary difference between any pair of caviar models is the organization and treatment of @xmath22 , the regressive parameter . in the case of sav , we were interested in a @xmath11 that reflected magnitude of change in portfolio returns , where in as , we were interested in only extreme ends of a series of returns",
    ". however , how are the underlying parameters actually measured ?",
    "koenker and basset ( 1978 ) introduced the notion of a sample quantile to a linear regression .",
    "consider a sample of observations @xmath23 generated by the linear model @xmath24 where @xmath10 is a length p vector of regressors ( i.e. returns ) , and @xmath25 is the @xmath9-quantile of @xmath26 conditional on @xmath10 .",
    "consider the linear representation of an adaptive process : @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath9 regression quantile is @xmath28 to satisfy the objective @xmath29[y_t - f_t(\\beta)]\\ ] ] qualitatively , we adjust beta until var is no longer exceeded , or `` hit '' by a certain amount . such a condition is satisfied when the observed indicator variables are 0 . to account for the set of available information , @xmath30 = f_t(\\beta^0 ) + \\epsilon_{t \\theta } , \\ \\",

    "while the expanded set of models available now account for the autocorrelation of returns , as well as large deviations , they must be tested . given a new observation , the model remains valid if @xmath35 = \\theta$ ] .",
    "if such a condition holds for the entirety of the time series , then it is proven valid . as shown by christoffersen ( 1998 ) ,",
    "such a method is equivalent to testing for the independence of indicator variables for the same condition . in other words ,",
    "@xmath36_{t=1}^t = \\{i_t \\}_{t=1}^t$ ] .",
    "while this provides for a natural test of forecasting models , it does not fully assess the validity of quantiles . to test conditional quantile models , we introduce a representative indicator variable that changes with the quantile itself .",
    "define a sequence of independent random variables @xmath37 such that    * @xmath38 * @xmath39    expressing positive or negative autocorrelated returns in terms of @xmath40 indeed accounts for the probability of exceeding a quantile .",
    "however , whilst the unconditional probabilities are uncorrelated , the conditional probabilities for a hit still depend on one another . because these tests evaluate the lower bound of the var in the weakest sense",
    ", we work towards defining a dynamic quantile .",
    "let @xmath41 @xmath42 assumes a value of @xmath43 for underestimations of var , and @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "notice that the expected value is zero , and that there should be no autocorrelation in the values between successive hits .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    for our first test , we determine whether the test statistic , @xmath45 is significantly different from zero where @xmath46 may depend on @xmath28 , and is q - measurable information ( i.e. returns ) .",

    "such a test would be run both in - sample , as well as out - of - sample .",
    "we will define and prove the conditions of each .",
    "if the assumptions made ( see appendix ) are valid , the following holds @xmath48^{-\\frac{1}{2}}t^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } x'(\\hat{\\beta } ) hit(\\hat{\\beta } ) \\sim n(0,i)\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the difference between @xmath51 and a function of the gradient of @xmath52 .        essentially , the dq test above tests whether or not the test statistic follows a normal distribution in the sense of an identity matrix , and whether the set of all dynamic quantiles in - sample follow a chi - squared distribution .",

    "the ideal quantile test would be one in which all hits @xmath56 are independent .",
    "regulators would be able to choose between different measures of var when evaluating a portfolio .",
    "the historical series of portfolio returns were studied for four different regimes of caviar .",
    "a total of 2,553 daily prices from wdrs / crsp for general motors ( gm ) , international business machines ( ibm ) , and the sp 500 ( spx ) were retrieved .",
    "daily returns were computed as 100 times the difference of the log of the prices .",
    "two sets of ranges were used : one from april 7 , 1986 to april 7 , 1999 , and the other from april 7 , 1999 to june 1 , 2009 . from the total set of daily prices ,",

    "information in the 2000 s was much more readily available than it was during 1980 - 2000 .",
    "consequently , a rapid digestion and reflection of information in asset prices may have resulted in more dynamic expectation .",
    "we see immediately that conditional var is much lower , indicating that the arrival of information did not induce as much uncertainty as it did in the decade prior .",
