    "this together with theorem [ thm_not_quasi - line_3 ] shows that the only facet - defining subgraphs @xmath28 of @xmath0-perfect claw - free not quasi - line graphs @xmath1 with @xmath126 have @xmath303 and are , by theorem [ thm_n+imperfect_alpha2 ] , cliques , odd antiholes or their complete joins .",
    "thus , every @xmath0-perfect claw - free not quasi - line graph @xmath1 with @xmath126 is joined a - perfect and , thus , the @xmath0-perfect graph conjecture holds true for this class . combining corollary",
    "[ cor_alpha2_2 ] with the above results shows that all @xmath0-perfect claw - free but not quasi - line graphs are joined @xmath39-perfect and we obtain :    [ cor_not_quasi - line ] the @xmath0-perfect graph conjecture is true for all claw - free graphs that are not quasi - line .",
    "finally , we obtain our main result ( theorem [ thm_main ] ) as direct consequence of corollary [ cor_quasi - line ] and corollary [ cor_not_quasi - line ] : the @xmath0-perfect graph conjecture is true for all claw - free graphs .",
    "the context of this work was the study of @xmath0-perfect graphs , i.e. , graphs where a single application of the lovsz - schrijver psd - operator @xmath0 to the edge relaxation yields the stable set polytope .",
    "hereby , we are particularly interested in finding an appropriate polyhedral relaxation @xmath49 of @xmath2 that coincides with @xmath304 and @xmath2 if and only if @xmath1 is @xmath0-perfect .",
    "an according conjecture has been recently formulated ( @xmath0-perfect graph conjecture ) ; here we verified it for the well - studied class of claw - free graphs ( theorem [ thm_main ] ) .        from the presented results and proofs",
    ", we can draw some further conclusions .",
    "first of all , we can determine the subclass of joined @xmath39-perfect graphs to which all @xmath0-perfect claw - free graphs belong to . in @xcite",
    ", it is suggested to call a graph @xmath1 _ @xmath306-perfect _ if the only facets of @xmath2 are associated with cliques and minimally imperfect graphs . according to @xcite ,",
    "@xmath1 is _ joined @xmath306-perfect _ if @xmath2 is given only by facets associated with cliques , minimally imperfect graphs and their complete joins .",
    "theorem [ hipomatch ] together with the results from section [ results ] provide the complete list of all facet - defining @xmath0-perfect claw - free graphs :              note that galluccio and sassano provided in @xcite a complete characterization of the rank facet - defining claw - free graphs : they either belong to one of the following three families of rank - minimal graphs    * cliques , * partitionable webs @xmath307 ( where @xmath308 and @xmath309 stand for stability and clique number , resp . ) , * line graphs of minimal 2-connected hypomatchable graphs @xmath97 ( where @xmath310 is not hypomatchable anymore for any edge @xmath311 ) ,    or can be obtained from them by means of two operations , sequential lifting and complete join .",
    "our results show : an @xmath0-perfect claw - free graph @xmath1 has , besides cliques , only odd holes and odd antiholes as rank - minimal subgraphs ; cliques are the only subgraphs in @xmath1 that can be sequentially lifted to larger rank facet - defining subgraphs , where complete joins can only be taken of odd antiholes .",
    "note further that , besides verifying the @xmath0-perfect graph conjecture for claw - free graphs , we obtained the complete list of all minimally @xmath0-imperfect claw - free graphs .",
    "in fact , the results in @xcite imply that the following graphs are minimally @xmath0-imperfect :    * graphs @xmath1 with @xmath77 such that @xmath78 is an odd antihole for some node @xmath79 , not completely joined to @xmath78 , * the web @xmath92 , * @xmath0-imperfect line graphs ( which are all node stretchings of @xmath76 or @xmath48 ) .      finally , the subject of the present work has parallels to the well - developed research area of perfect graph theory also in terms of polynomial time computability .",
    "in fact , it has the potential of reaching even stronger results due the following reasons .",
    "recall that calculating the value @xmath312 can be obtained with arbitrary precision in polynomial time for every graph @xmath1 , even in the weighted case , by @xcite .",
    "thus , the stable set problem can be solved in polynomial time for a strict superset of perfect graphs , the @xmath0-perfect graphs , by @xmath313 .",
    "hence , our future lines of research include to find    * new families of graphs where the conjecture holds ( e.g. , by characterizing the minimally @xmath0-imperfect graphs within the class ) , * new subclasses of @xmath0-perfect or joined a - perfect graphs , * classes of graphs @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath304 are `` close enough '' to have @xmath314 .    in particular ,",
    "the class of graphs @xmath1 with @xmath314 can be expected to be large since @xmath304 is a much stronger relaxation of @xmath2 than @xmath14 . in all cases ,",
    "the stable set problem could be approximated with arbitrary precision in polynomial time in these graph classes by optimizing over @xmath304 .",
    "finally , note that @xmath315 with @xmath316 clearly gives an even stronger relaxation of @xmath2 than @xmath304 .",
    "however , already approximating with arbitrary precision over @xmath317 can not be done in polynomial time anymore for all graphs @xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath0-perfect graphs or their generalizations satisfying @xmath314 are the most promising cases in this context .",
