    "to solve a conformal field theory ( cft ) amounts to finding its spectrum and 3-point correlation functions , since higher point functions may be obtained using the operator product expansion ( ope ) . in the former case",
    "this means finding the anomalous dimensions of the operators of the theory , while in the latter case it means finding the couplings in 3-point correlation functions , whose space - time dependence is otherwise fixed by conformal invariance . in the simplest case of scalar primary operators",
    "the 3-point function has the simple form _ a(0)o_b(x)o_c(y)= . where @xmath11 is the dimension of the operator @xmath2 , and so on .",
    "the definition of the couplings @xmath12 requires that the operators diagonalise the anomalous dimension matrix and depends on the choice of normalisation in the 2-point function of each operator .",
    "our main interest is to explore new methods to compute the couplings @xmath12 for certain single trace operators in @xmath4 sym . in recent years",
    "there have been great progresses in finding the spectrum of this theory , in the planar limit and for any value of the coupling constant , using integrability @xcite-@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , much remains to be done in the computation of the couplings @xmath12 . at weak coupling these",
    "may be evaluated , order by order in perturbation theory , by computing feynman diagrams @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although this approach is essential to uncover new structures and to verify new exact results , it is unpractical to obtain exact results for general operators .",
    "a more promising approach is to explore integrability of planar @xmath4 sym .",
    "however , how integrability will enter computations of the couplings @xmath12 remains unclear .",
    "one strategy to compute the couplings in a cft is to deform the theory from its fixed point with a marginal or irrelevant operator @xmath0 .",
    "we will show in section 2 that this deformation introduces new divergences in the renormalised operators of the critical theory , which are determined by the couplings @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , to leading order in the deformation parameter , the entry of the deformed anomalous dimension matrix between operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 is determined by the coupling @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in planar @xmath4 sym , finding the action of such matrix on operators diagonalized by means of the bethe ansatz is a new method to compute the couplings @xmath1 . in practice",
    ", we will show in section 3 how to implement these ideas in the case of the coupling deformation , which is considerably easier since it is an exact deformation .",
    "another example , that is expected to work in a similar fashion is the @xmath13 deformation of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "more general deformations may also be considered . whether this technique will be useful in unveiling new integrability structures in the perturbative computation of the couplings",
    "@xmath12 remains an open problem .    at strong t hooft coupling",
    "we may use the ads / cft duality @xcite to compute the couplings @xmath12 .",
    "the duality relates the @xmath14 string partition function , computed with suitable boundary condition , to the generating functional for correlation functions of the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "however , in practice this relation has been useful only to compute , at strong coupling , correlation functions of chiral operators that are dual to the supergravity fields @xcite .",
    "recently , a path integral approach to compute the string theory partition function for a heavy string state propagating between two boundary points has been developed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the string path integral is dominated by a classical saddle point , giving a new method to compute at strong coupling the 2-point function of single trace operators with a large number of basic fields @xcite . in section 4",
    "we shall extend this computation to the case of a 3-point function with an additional chiral operator .",
    "the basic idea is that , taking into account the coupling between the heavy string worldsheet and the supergravity fields , the path integral giving the aforementioned 2-point function can be extended to include the interaction with light fields . in practice",
    "all one needs to do is to compute a witten diagram with a supergravity field propagating from the @xmath14 boundary to the heavy string worldsheet , which acts as a tadpole for this field .",
    "we will show how this computation works for the dilaton field and several heavy string configurations , obtaining couplings of the form @xmath15 , in complete agreement with the value predicted by renormalisation group arguments .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with comments and open problems .",
    "the goal of this section is to show how to relate the 3-point correlation function in a cft to the anomalous dimension matrix obtained from deforming the cft with a marginal or irrelevant operator @xmath0 of dimension @xmath16 at the cft fixed point .",
    "we emphasise that the results presented in this section are valid at a cft fixed point with coupling @xmath17",
    ". we shall explore basic ideas given in @xcite ( see also appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "the example that we have in mind , and that we will work in detail in the following sections , is @xmath4 sym , so we shall stick to four dimensions . in this case",
    ", the dimension @xmath16 of the operator @xmath0 satisfies @xmath18 . in the case of @xmath4 sym",
    "we have a line of cft s parameterised by the coupling constant @xmath17 , so we may wish to take the coupling to be finite and large , or to expand to arbitrary order in the coupling constant . we may also wish to consider an operator @xmath0 of protected dimension , but that is not necessary .    our starting point is a cft with action @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the deformed theory with action @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimensionless deformation parameter at the cut - off scale @xmath22 of dimension inverse length , and the operators that appear in this action are the renormalized operators of the undeformed theory .",
    "the beta function for the coupling @xmath21 has the form , @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents terms quadratic , or of higher powers , in the couplings to all operators around the fixed point . for what we are doing it will be sufficient to work to linear order in @xmath21 ,",
    "so we keep only the first term in the beta function @xmath25 with @xmath16 computed at the fixed point .",
    "sending the cut - off to infinity , the coupling @xmath26 at a fixed scale @xmath27 is constant for @xmath28 ( marginal deformation ) and vanishes for @xmath29 ( irrelevant deformation ) . for simplicity we shall consider the operator @xmath0 to be a scalar primary . but",
    "this can be generalised to more operators , for instance , @xmath0 could be the energy - momentum tensor , in which case @xmath21 would be a tensor valued deformation parameter .    for the sake of clarity",
    ", we shall consider in what follows the case of an operator @xmath0 with dimension @xmath28 at the fixed point .",
    "since we are interested in the case of @xmath4 sym at any value of the coupling , this means the operator has protected dimension . in the appendix",
    "we extend our results to the case of irrelevant deformations .",
    "we decided to separate the discussion because in the following sections we shall be working with the marginal case , therefore avoiding the duplication of formulae in the main text .    a final introductory word about notation",
    ", we shall use the label @xmath21 to denote quantities computed in the deformed cft with action given by ( [ deformedaction ] ) .",
    "quantities without the label @xmath21 are computed at the undeformed theory for which @xmath30 .",
    "we now analyse the divergences that appear in the deformed theory , in terms of renormalized quantities of the undeformed theory .",
    "let @xmath2 be any renormalized operator of the undeformed theory .",
    "we shall denote its full dimension ( classical + quantum ) , at the fixed point , by @xmath11 . when computing the correlation function of this operator with any other operators , we obtain in the deformed theory to linear order in @xmath21 , @xmath31 where the right hand side of this equation is computed in the undeformed theory .",
    "in general new divergences can appear in equation ( [ expansionn - pf ] ) , that can be cancelled by renormalizing the operators @xmath32 , and that come from the behaviour of the correlation function involving @xmath33 , when @xmath34 approaches any of the positions of the other operators .",
    "the form of this divergences is entirely determined by the ope in the undeformed theory of the operator @xmath0 with the operators appearing in the correlation function . for the operator @xmath35 we have @xmath36 where the constants @xmath1 are precisely the couplings appearing in the 3-point function @xmath37 .",
    "we remark that for now we assume that the complete basis of operators @xmath38 is diagonal with unit norm , i.e. @xmath39 the physically meaningful couplings @xmath1 are defined with respect to operators satisfying this normalisation .    using the ope expansion ( [ ope ] ) , we conclude that the divergence in the @xmath34 integral of ( [ expansionn - pf ] ) , arising from the region of integration @xmath40 , is given by @xmath41 hence , powerlike divergences arise from operators that enter the ope of @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and whose dimensions satisfy @xmath42 . by the unitarity bounds this is a finite number of operators , for instance",
    ", for scalar operators in four dimensions we must have @xmath43 .",
    "logarithmic divergences appear from operators in the ope with @xmath44 .",
    "we are now in position to define renormalized operators @xmath45 of the deformed theory , expressed in terms of renormalized operators of the undeformed theory , such that the general correlation function ( [ expansionn - pf ] ) is finite .",
    "this is quite simple , because there is a finite number of operators @xmath3 entering the ope ( [ ope ] ) and contributing to the divergences in ( [ divergences ] ) .",
    "we define the renormalized operators @xmath46 as usual , we see that operator mixing occurs for @xmath47 . in terms of bare operators of the undeformed theory , then , in a theory without dimensional couplings , mixing will only occur between operators of the same classical dimension , i.e. for @xmath48 .",
    "then , the last term in ( [ renormalized ] ) only concerns operators with different anomalous dimensions , since the power like divergence becomes logarithmic when expanding in the coupling @xmath17 . ] with this renormalization scheme , correlation functions @xmath49 computed at the fixed value of the coupling @xmath17 , and to linear order in @xmath21 for the theory with action ( [ deformedaction ] ) , are finite",
    ".    of particular importance to us will be the case of 2-point functions .",
    "for operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the same dimension in the undeformed theory , it is simple to see that @xmath50 for @xmath51 this gives @xmath52 if there are different operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 of equal dimension , we see that the effect of turning on the deformation is to induce operator mixing , since the above 2-point function is no longer diagonal .",
    "it is also simple to see that the 2-point function for operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 of different dimension still vanishes .",
    "we now wish to better understand the basis of renormalized operators introduced in the previous section , by defining a deformed anomalous dimension matrix . we will then verify the callan - symanzik equation for correlation functions in the deformed theory .",
    "let us start by defining renormalized operators of the deformed theory using the usual renormalization matrix @xmath53 where we omitted the summation in @xmath54 .",
    "from ( [ renormalized ] ) we can read the entries of this matrix , @xmath55 it is now simple to compute the anomalous dimension matrix associated to the deformation , defined by @xmath56 its non - vanishing entries are _ ab = u 2 ^ 2 a_dab ^_a-_b , [ deformedgamma ] for @xmath57 .",
    "we remark that the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath58 is defined with respect to renormalized operators of the undeformed theory with total dimension given by @xmath11 at the fixed point . if we order the operators in blocks with descending value of dimension , the non - diagonal top - right blocks of the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath59 have zero entries .",
    "it is then clear that its eigenvalues @xmath60 are independent of the cut - off @xmath22 , although the eigenvectors do depend in general on @xmath22 ( when there is mixing between operators of different dimension ) .",
    "thus , in the diagonal basis we have , as usual , @xmath61 .    an alternative way of deriving the relation between the anomalous dimension @xmath58 and the couplings @xmath62 is to verify the callan - symanzik equation .",
    "this is simpler for a marginal deformation , and to linear order in @xmath21 , because the beta function @xmath25 vanishes ( in the appendix we consider the case of irrelevant deformations ) . for the non - renormalized two - point function of the deformed theory , computed using renormalized operators of the cft at the fixed point",
    ", the callan - symanzik equation has the form @xmath63 using ( [ expansionn - pf ] ) and the form of the divergences given in ( [ divergences ] ) this equation is satisfied provided ( [ deformedgamma ] ) holds .    for practical perturbative computations it is useful to relate the couplings @xmath62 to the anomalous dimension matrix computed with respect to bare operators of the cft ( not renormalized ) .",
    "let us denote a basis of such operators by @xmath64 .",
    "now assume that we manage to diagonalize the anomalous dimension matrix of the critical theory , so that in the basis @xmath64 we have @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are the eigenvalues ( for instance , in @xmath4 sym we can use integrability techniques to do that quite effectively ) . in this basis , and denoting by @xmath67 the classical dimension of operators , it is simple to see that the renormalization matrix @xmath68 relating bare operators to the renormalized operators of the deformed theory in the usual way , @xmath69 , has entries @xmath70 the corresponding deformed anomalous dimension matrix has entries ^u_ab = _ ab _ a + u 2 ^ 2 a_dab ^^0_a-^0_b .",
    "[ deformedh ] note that these are the entries of the matrix @xmath71 in the basis @xmath64 that diagonalizes the anomalous dimension matrix of the critical theory .",
    "again , it is important to realize that the structure of the matrix @xmath71 , given by ( [ deformedh ] ) , implies that its eigenvalues are independent of the cut - off @xmath22 , although the eigenvectors may depend on @xmath22 .",
    "let us show explicitly how the knowledge of the deformed anomalous dimension @xmath71 allows to relate the couplings @xmath1 to the deformed anomalous dimensions and renormalized operators @xmath45 expressed in terms of the bare quantities .",
    "first we write the anomalous dimension matrix as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the anomalous dimension matrix of the critical theory , and @xmath74 is the term arising from the deformation which we treat as a perturbation . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the operators @xmath65 and @xmath75 do not have the same anomalous dimension at the critical point ( they may or may not have the same classical dimension ) .",
    "then , writing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath71 respectively as @xmath76 basic quantum mechanics formulae gives @xmath77 where the matrix elements are computed in the basis @xmath38 with unit normalised operators . from the explicit form of the deformed anomalous dimension matrix in the basis @xmath64 given in ( [ deformedh ] ) , we conclude that @xmath78 note that ( [ final2 ] ) has the correct dependence in the cut - off @xmath22 to relate operators @xmath2 and @xmath79 of different dimension , as required by ( [ quantummechanics ] ) .",
    "it is now clear that if we have a way of determining the action of the perturbation matrix @xmath80 on the bare operators , we may then compute the corresponding couplings using ( [ final ] ) and ( [ final2 ] )",
    ". this will be the case in the next section , where we consider coupling deformations of @xmath4 sym and the known form of the integrable anomalous dimension matrix at a given order in the coupling constant .",
    "we finish this section with a word on normalization of operators . in the next section",
    "it will actually be convenient to perform computations with operators that are not normalized to unit , i.e. after diagonalizing the eigenvectors of the undeformed theory we will have @xmath81 with this normalization , to obtain the physically meaningful couplings for the unit normalized operators , we need to divide the operators in equations ( [ final ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) by their norm .",
    "in this section we consider the simplest case of @xmath4 sym deformed by the lagrangian operator , since this theory is actually a line of fixed points parametrised by the coupling constant .",
    "we shall use integrability to show how to compute the couplings in the 3-point function of the lagrangian with any two operators of the theory . for simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the @xmath82 scalar subsector , and consider in detail operators corresponding to two - magnon excitations in the spin chain language .",
    "we shall use the following convention for the @xmath4 sym action @xmath83 ^ 2 + { \\rm fermions}\\big)\\ , , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and the covariant derivative is defined by @xmath85 $ ] . all fields are in the adjoint representation and the @xmath86 generators are normalized with @xmath87 .",
    "we will be considering the @xmath82 sector with complex scalars @xmath88 now consider the theory at some fixed value of the t hooft coupling , defined by @xmath89 we will consider ( planar ) perturbation theory to some order in the coupling @xmath90 .",
    "we are therefore considering the cft at the fixed point with coupling @xmath90 .",
    "then , to deform the theory with @xmath91 , it is clear from ( [ action ] ) that we should write @xmath92 hence , making this replacement in the anomalous dimension matrix of @xmath4 , to a given order in @xmath90 , and then keeping only the linear terms in @xmath21 , we obtain the form of the deformed anomalous dimension matrix @xmath71 .",
    "we may then use the results ( [ final ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) to compute the couplings .",
    "alternatively , we can also compute the derivative of @xmath93 or @xmath45 with respect to @xmath21 or , instead , the derivative @xmath94 of @xmath95 or @xmath2 to a given order in @xmath90 .",
    "finally , note that the two - point function of the lagrangian is ( dropping the @xmath96 correction ) @xmath97 we shall compute the couplings with respect to this normalization , but it is simple to re - scale with respect to the unit normalised lagrangean @xmath98 . in that case",
    "we would obtain that all the couplings @xmath99 computed in this paper are of order @xmath96 , for fixed t hooft coupling , as expected .",
    "as an example consider single trace operators made by @xmath100 fields of the @xmath82 sector and regard the fields @xmath101 as impurities in the vacuum state @xmath102 . for operators with @xmath103 impurities , we use the integers @xmath104 to indicate the position of the impurities in the corresponding spin chain , @xmath105",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix is that of an integrable spin chain and may be diagonalized by solving the bethe equations @xcite . then the operator @xmath2 , with anomalous dimension @xmath95 , is given by @xmath106 where the wave function @xmath107 is parameterized by the momenta @xmath108 of the magnons , which in general can be complex , sum to zero mod @xmath109 , and depend on the t hooft coupling .",
    "then , the contribution of the @xmath110-th magnon to the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath2 is given by @xcite @xmath111 this formula is believed to be correct to all orders in the t hooft coupling , provided wrapping effects , that become important at order @xmath112 , are neglected .",
    "the interactions between magnons are responsible for the dependence of their momenta on the t hooft coupling .",
    "this effect appears in the computation of the anomalous dimension at two - loop order , while is appears at one - loop in the computation of the coupling @xmath113 .",
    "thus , neglecting wrapping effects , ( [ final ] ) gives the all - loop result @xmath114 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "we remark that the normalised coupling @xmath115 scales with @xmath96 as expected .",
    "we shall compute in the next section this coupling up to order @xmath116 , in the simple case of operators with two - magnons .",
    "next we consider the dilute limit of @xmath117 . in this limit",
    "the magnons propagate freely on the spin chain and their momentum is trivially quantised as @xmath118 in this case the second term in the numerator of ( [ alllooplaa ] ) can be dropped .",
    "one may now study both weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "the leading order term in @xmath90 , which comes from the 1-loop correction to the anomalous dimension of @xmath2 , is given by @xmath119 and can be derived simply by doing wick contractions between @xmath120 , @xmath2 and @xmath121 . on the other hand , at strong coupling and neglecting wrapping effects ,",
    "we have @xmath122 in section  [ sec : strongcoup ] we shall confirm this computation of the coupling @xmath113 , by directly computing this 3-point function using the ads / cft duality in the gravity limit .",
    "we shall now illustrate how one can use integrability techniques and the general results given in ( [ final ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) to compute the couplings of two operators , each with two magnons , and the lagrangian .",
    "we will compute 1-loop corrections to these couplings , which correspond to diagonalizing the anomalous dimension matrix at two - loop order .",
    "the corresponding spin chain hamiltonian includes next to neighbour interactions @xcite , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the permutation operator . at this order ,",
    "the bethe wave function includes a contact term and can be written in the following form @xcite @xmath125 with @xmath126 since for two magnons the total momentum vanishes , we have @xmath127",

    "this amounts to computing the matrix element @xmath144 . using the two - loop anomalous dimension matrix given in ( [ anomalousdimmatrix ] ) we have @xmath145",
    "now we argue that the first two terms in this expression do not contribute to @xmath144 .",
    "first recall that @xmath146 and @xmath147 are eigenstates of @xmath73 , with terms of order @xmath148 and @xmath90 . since @xmath73 is diagonalized by these eigenstates , the contribution from the first term in @xmath80 vanishes .",
    "moreover , since the second term in @xmath80 starts at order @xmath116 , for this term we may consider the eigenstates @xmath146 and @xmath147 only at order @xmath148 .",
    "thus , this term is proportional to the hamiltonian @xmath73 at one - loop , and it will also give a vanishing contribution .",

    "it is expected that such computation will show a direct relation with integrability , but that remains to be seen .    * acknowledgements *    the authors are grateful to joo penedones and pedro vieira for helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank konstantin zarembo for sharing with us a draft of his work @xcite , which has some overlap with section 4 of this article . m.s.c . wishes to thank nordita for hospitality during the programme _ integrability in string and gauge theories ; ads / cft duality and its applications_. d.z .",

    "in this appendix we re - write the formulae of section 2 for the case of irrelevant deformations .",
    "the main results for the renormalization of operators are essentially the same , so we shall be brief .",
    "the first modification is that we must be careful with the running of the coupling @xmath21 , so that correlation functions involving a renormalized operator of the undeformed theory @xmath2 become @xmath280 where we work to linear order in the deformation parameter @xmath21 , as defined at the cut - off scale @xmath22 . using the ope expansion between @xmath0 and @xmath2 given in ( [ ope ] ) , we conclude that the region of integration @xmath40 contributes with @xmath281 for @xmath57 .",
    "we renormalize the operators of the deformed theory according to @xmath282 so that the correlation functions @xmath283 are finite . with this prescription",
    "the two - point function between operators @xmath284 remains the same .",
    "this is expected because the deformation is irrelevant and therefore , to leading order in @xmath21 , it is not expected to change the anomalous dimension of operators .",
    "we remark that the constant renormalization in ( [ irr_renormalized ] ) for @xmath44 guarantees that this two - point function remains diagonal and with the same normalization .",
    "the above renormalization scheme corresponds to a renormalization matrix ( [ rmatrix ] ) with entries z_ab = _ ab + u 2 ^ 2 a_dab .",
    "the corresponding anomalous dimension matrix @xmath58 defined in ( [ gamma ] ) is the same as for the marginal case given in ( [ deformedgamma ] ) .",
    "the callan - symanzik equation will now include the running of the coupling @xmath21 .",
    "for example , for 2-point functions we have @xmath285 with @xmath286 .",
    "this equation is verified provided ( [ deformedgamma ] ) holds .    finally , it is useful to define the renormalized operators starting from the undeformed bare theory . in this case",
    "the renormalization matrix @xmath68 has entries _",
    "ab = _ ab _ a+ u 2 ^ 2 a_dab .",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix again has entries given by ( [ deformedh ] ) .",
    "the relation between the entries of the deformed anomalous dimension matrix @xmath80 , computed in a diagonal basis of the anomalous dimension matrix of the critical theory , and the couplings @xmath1 is as for the marginal case presented at the end of section 2 .",
