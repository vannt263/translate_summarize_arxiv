    "einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite put forth the question of whether the quantum mechanical description of physical reality is complete , giving the example of a two - particle quantum state showing peculiar correlations ( dubbed `` entanglement '' or `` verschrnkung '' by schrdinger @xcite ) : if one measures the position or momentum of one particle , one can predict with certainty the outcome of measuring their counterpart for the other particle .",
    "thus , depending on which measurement is chosen for the first particle , the value of either the position or momentum can be predicted with arbitrary precision for the second particle .",
    "the ensuing controversy has revolved around the interpretation of the epr problem and its implications on quantum theory @xcite .",
    "later , bohm considered @xcite two entangled spin-1/2 particles , which have become the focus of attention on this epr issue : their _ discrete - variable _ entangled states have served to demonstrate the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with local realism , by the violation of bell s inequality @xcite . in recent years , there has been revival of interest in _ continuous - variable _ entanglement , in the spirit of the original epr problem @xcite .",
    "the original _ ideal _ epr @xcite state of two particles1 and 2 , is , respectively , represented as follows in their coordinates or momenta ( in one dimension ) , @xmath0 if two particles are prepared in such a state , and one measures the value of @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) of particle 1 , one can predict the result of measuring @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 , respectively ) with perfect precision . the state of eq .",
    "( [ eprstatedelta ] ) would , however , occupy infinite space and have infinite kinetic energy .",
    "one can consider more realistic variants of this state , e.g. , a gaussian state given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( see fig . [ figepr ] ) .",
    "the original epr state corresponds to the limit @xmath7 .",
    "after measuring the position of particle 1 , the position of particle 2 is centered at @xmath8 with the uncertainty @xmath9^{-1/2}$ ] . in the limit of @xmath10 , the position of particle 2",
    "is centered at @xmath1 , and its uncertainty is @xmath11 .",
    "similar relations hold also for the momentum of particle 2 after the momentum of particle 1 is measured .",
    "thus , either of the two conjugate quantities of particle 2 can be predicted with arbitrarily high precision .",
    "of course , the heisenberg uncertainty relation is not violated , since for a single system one can measure only one of the two conjugate quantities .",
    "approximate versions of the translational epr state , wherein the @xmath12-function correlations are replaced by finite - width distributions , have been shown to characterize the quadratures of the two optical - field outputs of parametric downconversion @xcite , or of a fiber interferometer with kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "such states allow for various schemes of continuous - variable quantum information processing such as quantum teleportation @xcite or quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "a similar state has also been predicted and realized using collective spins of large atomic samples @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that if suitable interaction schemes can be realized , continuous - variable quantum states of the original epr type could even serve for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding its applications to quantum information processing , the translational epr state of eq .",
    "( [ eprstategauss ] ) does not entail a violation of local realism : such a state has a _ non - negative _ wigner function , controlling the position and momentum distribution of each particle .",
    "nevertheless , there exist measurement schemes in which an analog of bell s inequality is violated @xcite for such a state  as for any pure entangled state .",
    "the realization and measurement of the epr translational correlations of _ material particles _ appears to be very difficult .",
    "there have been suggestions to start with entangled light fields and to transfer their quantum state into the state of trapped ions in optical cavities @xcite or of vibrating mirrors @xcite .",
    "we have proposed to realize translational epr states by taking advantage of interatom correlations in a dissociating diatom @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have considered dipole - dipole coupled cold atoms in an optical lattice as a source of translational epr states @xcite .    in order to generate the translational epr entanglement between interacting material particles , one must be able to accomplish several challenging tasks : ( a ) switch on and off the entangling interaction ; ( b ) confine their motion to single dimension , and ( c ) infer and verify the dynamical variables of particle 2 _ at the time of measurement _ of particle 1 .",
    "the latter requirement is particularly hard for free particles , since by the time we complete the prediction for particle 2 , its position will have changed . in @xcite",
    "we suggested to overcome these hurdles by transforming the wavefunction of flying ( ionized ) atoms emerging from diatom dissociation by an electrostatic / magnetic lens onto the image plane , where its position corresponds to what it was at the time of the diatom dissociation .",
    "in @xcite we have proposed a solution based on the following steps : ( i ) controlling the diatom formation and dissociation in an optical lattice by switching on and off a laser - induced dipole - dipole interaction ; ( ii ) controlling the motion and effective masses of the atoms and the diatom by changing the intensities of the lattice fields . in this article",
    "we discuss our proposal in more detail and elaborate on its principles .",
    "our aim here is to demonstrate the feasibility of preparing a momentum- and position - entangled state of atom pairs in optical lattices , which would be a variant of the original epr state , owing to lattice diffraction . in sec .",

    "[ fig - lattice ] .",
    "the lattices are very sparsely occupied by two kinds of atoms , each kind interacting with only one of the two lattices .",
    "this can be realized , e.g. , by assuming two different internal ( say , hyperfine ) states of the atoms @xcite . in both lattices",
    ", the potentials are strongly confining in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions ( realized by strong laser fields ) , whereas in the @xmath16 direction the lattice potential is only moderately to weakly confining .",
    "thus , the motion of each particle is restricted to the @xmath16 direction . in each direction",
    "we assume that only the lowest vibrational energy band is occupied .",
    "initially , the potential minima of the lattices are displaced from each other by an amount @xmath17 in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "an auxiliary laser produces a laser - induced dipole - dipole interaction ( liddi ) between the atom pairs .",

    "the position - dependent part @xmath29 is a function of @xmath30 , the distance between the atoms , and @xmath31 , the angle between the interatomic axis and the wavevector of the coupling laser .",
    "since @xmath32 , @xmath33 has a pronounced minimum for atoms located at the nearest sites , @xmath34 , where @xmath35    the liddi energy as a function of @xmath36 and the relative position of the atoms is shown in figs . [ f - ddint ] and [ f - potent1 ] . under the above assumptions , we can treat the system as consisting of pairs of `` tubes '' , either empty or occupied , that are oriented along @xmath16 .",
    "only atoms within adjacent tubes are appreciably attracted to each other along @xmath14 , due to the liddi .",
    "let us focus on the subensemble of tube - pairs in which each tube is occupied by exactly one atom .",
    "in the 1d optical lattice , the single - atom hamiltonian is @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the atomic mass , @xmath39 is the momentum operator , @xmath40 is the maximum potential energy due to the interaction of the atomic dipole with the laser field , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dipole matrix element of the lattice transition , @xmath43 is the detuning of the lattice field from this transition , and @xmath44 is the intensity of the lattice field .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq - hlat2 ] ) describes a quantum pendulum .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the corresponding schrdinger equation are the mathieu functions @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues form bands , whose spectrum depends on the ratio of @xmath40 to the recoil energy , @xmath45 so that one can distinguish between strongly binding ( @xmath46 ) and weakly binding ( @xmath47 ) potentials .",
    "we assume that the atoms are cooled down to the lowest energy band of the lattice , in the absence of liddi .",
    "the state of each atom is then conveniently described in terms of wannier functions @xmath48 @xcite that are localized at lattice sites labeled by index @xmath49 .",
    "the wannier functions are superpositions of the delocalized bloch eigenfunctions @xmath50 of the same band , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of lattice sites , and @xmath53 is the position of the @xmath49th site .",
    "since the wannier functions are not eigenfunctions of the single - particle hamiltonian , an atom initially prepared in a wannier state that is localized at one site , will subsequently tunnel to the neighboring sites .",
    "nevertheless , if the tunneling rate is sufficiently slow , the single - particle hamiltonian in the wannier basis has a relatively simple form : @xmath54 here the diagonal elements @xmath55 are equal to the energy at the center of the band , and only two sets of off - diagonal elements , expressing hopping between the neighboring sites , are non - negligible : @xmath56 the hopping rate is related to the energy bandwidth of the lowest lattice band @xmath57 by @xmath58 ) , the quantum - pendulum schrdinger equation yields the approximate formulae for @xmath59 and the single - atom effective mass : @xmath60 the wannier functions of the lowest band can be approximated by gaussians : @xmath61 where @xmath62 this approximation is relatively accurate for @xmath63 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ figconprobx ] ) with fidelity @xmath64% .",
    "note , however , that the gaussian approximation is not suitable for calculating the hopping potential ( [ eq - vhop ] ) since this quantity is very sensitive to the non - gaussian tails of the wannier wavefunctions .",
    "let us now assume that two neighboring tubes in fig .",
    "[ f - lattice3 ] are occupied by one atom each and the liddi is turned on .",
    "if the tubes are close to each other ( @xmath65 , as in fig . [ f - ddint ] ) , the interaction hamiltonian in the wannier basis has nonzero elements only for atoms residing at the nearest sites , @xmath66 and the total two - atom hamiltonian is @xmath67 this hamiltonian has been diagonalized numerically , and its eigenvalues are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - envdd ] as a function of the hopping and binding potential strength .",
    "one can see that for a sufficiently large ratio @xmath68 a band of diatomic states is split off the band of independent atoms , towards lower energies .    for a strong liddi binding",
    ", @xmath69 , the ground state of the hamiltonian corresponds to a tightly bound diatom which can be approximated by @xmath70 this is a highly correlated state : when particle 1 is found at the @xmath49th site of lattice 1 , then particle 2 is found at the @xmath49th site of lattice 2 , with position dispersion given by the half - width @xmath71 of the atomic wannier function in the lowest band , @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - xx]a ) .",
    "the fourier transform of this wave function yields its momentum representation . the corresponding momentum probability distribution exhibits anti - correlation similarly to the epr states ( [ eprstatedelta ] ) or ( [ eprstategauss ] ) , but it reflects the lattice periodicity ( fig . [ fig - pp]a ) . in momentum space ,",
    "the state occupies a region of half - width @xmath73 , and the probability distribution has narrow ridges along @xmath74 .",
    "the width of the ridges is inversely proportional to the lattice size , @xmath75 , and they are shifted by @xmath76 from each other .    the probability of atoms to escape their epr partners `` over the next '' sites increases with the ratio @xmath77 .",
    "this leads to an increase of the position dispersion which can be estimated by first - order perturbation theory : let atoms 1 and 2 occupy the @xmath49th site in the absence of @xmath59 . with the perturbation @xmath59 on , atom 2 can occupy also sites @xmath78 , which have energies @xmath79 above the unperturbed state , with the probability @xmath80 .",
    "this contributes to an increase in the diatomic separation dispersion , @xmath81 resulting in the joint probability distribution of the atomic positions and momenta as a function of @xmath77 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - xx]b and fig .",
    "[ fig - pp]b , respectively .    the states of the tightly bound diatom form a separate band whose bandwidth is @xmath82 below the lowest atomic vibrational band .",
    "the _ diatomic _ hopping potential @xmath83 can be estimated by assuming that the two atoms consecutively hop to their neighboring sites , i.e. , the change @xmath84 is realized either via @xmath85 or via @xmath86 by adiabatic elimination of the higher - energy intermediate states , one obtains @xmath87    all the states of the diatomic band have correlated positions .",
    "however , the momenta are not anti - correlated in all these states in the same way as in the diatomic ground state . to realize strong momentum anti - correlations",
    ", we have to prepare a state that predominantly originates from the bottom of the diatomic band .",
    "if we work with thermal states this means that the temperature of the system must satisfy @xmath88 near the bottom of the band , the diatomic dynamics can be described by means of the 2-atom effective mass given by @xmath89 the thermal ( kinetic ) energy of the diatom is then related to the degree of momentum anti - correlation through the sum - momentum spread @xmath90 , @xmath91    to determine how `` strong '' the epr effect is , we compare the product of the half - widths of the position and momentum peaks in the tightly bound diatom state with the heisenberg uncertainty limit through the parameter @xcite : @xmath92 a value of @xmath93 higher than 1 indicates the occurrence of the epr effect ; the higher the value of @xmath93 , the stronger the effect .    strictly speaking , for the multi - peak momentum distribution , one should use a more general uncertainty relation , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite , that distinguishes the uncertainty of multiple narrow peaks from that of a single broad peak .",
    "however , even the simple half - width of the peaks is a useful measure of the epr effect . in order to maximize @xmath93",
    ", we must adhere to the trade - off between reducing either @xmath94 , by decreasing @xmath95 , or @xmath96 , by increasing @xmath95 .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath93 generally depends on the temperature of the diatom , as detailed below .",
    "cooling down the diatomic system to prepare the epr state is a non - trivial task .",
    "we suggest a `` cooling '' procedure which takes advantage of the difference between the single - atom and the diatom bandwidths , and of the possibility to change the light - induced potentials . the key is first to cool down individual atoms and then separate the unpaired atoms from the diatoms .",
    "the scheme consists of three steps :    \\(i ) we first switch on only an external , shallow , harmonic potential in the @xmath16 direction ( all other potentials being off ) , and cool the @xmath16-motion of the atoms down to its ground state .",
    "the width @xmath97 of the ground state should be several times the lattice constant ; it is related to the desired momentum anti - correlation by @xmath98 . the temperature necessary to achieve this must be @xmath99    \\(ii )",
    "a weak lattice potential in the @xmath16-direction is then slowly switched on , so that the state becomes @xmath100 where the coefficients @xmath101 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are gaussians localized around the minimum of the external potential .",
    "\\(iii ) we switch on the liddi and change the external potential , from an attractive well to a repulsive linear potential , acting to remove the particles from the lattice .",
    "the two parts of the wavefunction will respond differently : the motion of the paired atoms ( corresponding to @xmath102 ) will remain in the vicinity of the initial position because of their narrow energy band ( fig .",
    "[ pasy ] ) .",
    "single ( unpaired ) atoms , whose bandwidth is substantially larger , will travel a much longer distance before hitting the top of the energy band .",
    "thus , after a properly chosen time , the unpaired atoms could be removed from the @xmath16-region of interest , which is @xmath103 longer for single atoms than for diatoms [ see eq .",
    "( [ bandwidthdiat ] ) ] .    provided the time @xmath104 is short enough for the system to remain near the bottom of these two bands , the dynamics can be interpreted in terms of the appropriate effective masses : the `` heavy '' diatoms with mass move much slower than the `` light '' single atoms with mass ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "thus , after changing the sign of the external potential , the unpaired atoms will be ejected out of the lattice and separated from the diatoms as glumes from grains .",
    "this effect is illustrated by the numerical simulation in fig .",
    "[ celek ] for two lithium atoms in two lattices with @xmath105 323 nm ( corresponding to the transition 2s3p ) and a dipole - dipole coupling field of @xmath106 670.8 nm ( transition 2s2p ) .",
    "the dipole moment element of the lattice transition is @xmath107 cm , while the liddi coupling dipole element is @xmath108 cm . from these values",

    "the lattice and liddi field intensities are @xmath110 0.186 w/@xmath111 and @xmath112 0.023 w/@xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding field detunings are @xmath113 , @xmath114 , the respective decay rates being @xmath115 s@xmath116 , and @xmath117 s@xmath116 .",
    "the two lattices are displaced by @xmath118 40  nm . from these values",
    "we get the lattice potential @xmath119 , the liddi potential of the nearest atoms @xmath120 , and the hopping potential @xmath121 .",

    "the correlated pairs are prepared by first cooling independent atoms in an external harmonic potential with the ground - state half - width of @xmath123 ( frequency of 1 khz @xmath124  nk ) . when the linear external potential is switched on ,",
    "the atoms start moving in the direction of decreasing potential energy . figure  [ celek ] , which captures the situation at three consecutive times , shows that unpaired atoms ( off - diagonal peaks ) are displaced by a much longer distance than the diatoms ( diagonal peaks ) .",

    "the small effective mass of unpaired atoms allows us to cool them to temperatures higher than that corresponding to the bottom of the diatomic band .",
    "the price is , however , that most of the atoms are discarded and only a small fraction of @xmath131 will remain in the bound diatom state .",
