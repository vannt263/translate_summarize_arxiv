    "quantum discord ( qd )  @xcite has recently been identified as a general resource in quantum information protocols  ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in quantum computation",
    ", it has been conjectured as the origin of speed up in the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) mixed - state model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a fundamental role has been attributed to qd in tasks such as quantum locking  @xcite and quantum state discrimination  @xcite . besides quantum protocols , remarkable applications of qd have also been found in the characterization of quantum phase transitions  @xcite and in the description of quantum dynamics under decoherence  @xcite .    in order to use quantum correlations ( as provided by qd ) as a resource , we are faced with the problem of their distribution throughout a multipartite state . in this context , a monogamous behavior may reveal important information about the structure of quantum correlations . for instance , monogamy has been found to be the essential feature allowing for security in quantum key distribution  @xcite . in general grounds",
    ", it has been investigated whether any given measure @xmath0 of bipartite quantum correlation can obey a monogamy bound in an arbitrary tripartite quantum system @xmath1 .",
    "a measure @xmath0 has typically been defined as monogamous if it follows the inequality @xmath2 therefore , given a fixed value for the quantum correlation @xmath3 between subsystem @xmath4 and the remaining part @xmath5 of the system , then @xmath4 can not be freely correlated with the individual subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "such a monogamy bound is obeyed by certain entanglement measures , which is indeed the origin of _ tangle _",
    "@xcite as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement . whether or not monogamy can be obtained for a quantum correlation measure in arbitrary ( pure or mixed ) quantum states poses therefore as a further challenge . however , many attempts turned out to find a polygamous behavior for qd  @xcite .",
    "more generally , such a negative answer has been obtained for any sensible measure @xmath0 of quantum correlations  @xcite ( even though a function of @xmath0 may be able to yield a state - dependent trade - off  @xcite ) .",
    "the violation of the monogamy inequality  ( [ mon1 ] ) means that the _ single - site correlation _ @xmath3 is unable in general to set a limit for the sum of pairwise correlations .",
    "however , it does _ not _ imply that subsystems can be freely correlated . more specifically",
    ", it is possible to restore monogamy if we can find out a physical quantity that is able to provide a bound for the sum of pairwise correlations .",
    "_ here , we will investigate this problem by exploring such a route , providing a monogamy bound that holds for either pure or mixed states in a multipartite system composed of a number @xmath8 of subsystems_. in order to achieve this aim , we will show that a limit for the sum of pairwise quantum correlations is provided by a multipartite extension of qd , named as _ global quantum discord _ ( gqd ) , which has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of tripartite states , a monogamy bound",
    "will then be obtained by replacing @xmath3 for the gqd , denoted by @xmath9 , yielding @xmath10    a schematic description comparing the monogamy bounds for @xmath3 and @xmath9 is displayed in fig .",
    "the validity of inequality ( [ mon2 ] ) will be shown for all quantum states whose bipartite quantum discords do not increase under discard of subsystems . moreover , we will show that gqd allows for the extension of eq .",
    "( [ mon2 ] ) for the case of @xmath8 subsystems .",
    "we observe that the maximum of gqd typically increases with @xmath8 , which accounts for the fact that pairwise correlations are less monogamous than entanglement . on the other hand , as will be illustrated in several examples , gqd is sufficiently limited to provide a relevant constraint for the sum of pairwise qd . as an application , we will use eq .",
    "( [ mon2 ] ) to propose a natural measure of residual multipartite quantum correlations .",
    "qd , which has been introduced in ref .  @xcite and provides a measure of the quantumness of correlations , can be suitably defined as the minimal loss of total correlation after a non - selective measurement  @xcite . indeed , consider a bipartite system @xmath11 composed of subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath6 . denoting by @xmath12 the density operator of @xmath11 and by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the density operators of parts @xmath4 and @xmath6 ,",
    "respectively , the total correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath6 is measured by the quantum mutual information  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the von neumann entropy for @xmath4 and @xmath17 is the entropy of @xmath4 conditional on @xmath6 . by operating on subsystem @xmath6 , qd can then be expressed as @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 denotes a non - selective measurement @xmath20 on part @xmath6 of @xmath12 , which yields @xmath21 .",
    "note that this definition is asymmetric with respect to measurement on @xmath4 or @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , a strictly classical state requires both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , this corresponds to a density operator @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a joint probability distribution and the sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 constitute orthonormal bases for the systems @xmath4 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "such strictly classical states can also be identified by a single measure , which is the symmetrized version of qd @xmath28 ,   \\label{bipartitediscord}\\ ] ] where the measurement operator @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 eq .",

    "the vanishing of @xmath31 occurs if and only if the state is classical .",
    "in particular , the absence of @xmath31 is the key ingredient for local sharing of pre - established correlations ( local broadcasting )  @xcite .",
    "generalizations of quantum discord to multipartite states have been considered in different scenarios  @xcite , which intend to account for quantum correlations that may exist beyond pairwise subsystems in a composite system . in this direction ,",
    "one possible approach to account multipartite quantum correlations is to start from the symmetrized qd and then to systematically extend it to the multipartite scenario .",
    "this originates gqd as a measure of global quantum discord , as proposed in ref .",

    "moreover , it can be detected through a convenient ( with no extremization procedure ) witness operator  @xcite .",
    "concerning its applications , gqd has been shown to be useful in the characterization of quantum phase transitions  @xcite . in terms of operational interpretation",
    ", gqd may play a role in quantum communication , in the sense that its absence means that the quantum state simply describes a classical probability multidistribution @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and , therefore , allows for local broadcasting of correlations  @xcite .",
    "let us begin by defining the loss of correlation @xmath47 in a quantum state @xmath33 generated by a measurement @xmath48 , which is given by @xmath49 we can then show that @xmath47 can be decomposed in terms of loss of correlation for suitable bipartitions , as provided by the following theorem .    _ given a non - selective measurement @xmath48 , the loss of correlation @xmath47 can be decomposed as _ @xmath50 [ t1 ]    we rewrite @xmath47 by using eqs .",

    "( [ dentropy ] ) .",
    "after rearrangement of the terms , we obtain @xmath54 by recursively applying eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) , we can reduce the term @xmath55 to a sum of bipartite contributions @xmath56 which , when added to @xmath57 in eq .",

    "( [ eqdphi ] ) provides a decomposition of @xmath59 in terms of bipartite contributions . as a further step to achieve a monogamy trade - off ,",
    "we will now introduce gqd by minimizing @xmath47 over all measurements @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath60 .\\ ] ] then , a monogamy bound for quantum correlations in @xmath8-partite systems can be obtained , which is proved below .    _ for an arbitrary density operator @xmath33 with an amount of gqd given by @xmath32 , pairwise qd obeys the monogamy bound _",

    "( [ dn ] ) with respect to @xmath48 , yielding @xmath65 however , we have that @xmath66 then , by inserting eq .",
    "( [ minim ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ discord - in1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath67 hence , by using the condition that @xmath64 we obtain the monogamy bound stated by inequality  ( [ monogamybound ] ) .    in particular , for tripartite states , the monogamy inequality  ( [ monogamybound ] ) reduces to inequality  ( [ mon2 ] ) , provided that the condition @xmath68 is satisfied .",
    "we observe that this non - increasing behavior of bipartite qd under discard of subsystems is a sufficient condition for the validity of monogamy , but it is _ not _ a necessary requirement .",
    "this means that monogamy may hold even in more general scenarios .",
    "for example , consider a tripartite system composed of qubits abc in the mixed state @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the computational basis and @xmath71 .",
    "for this state , we have that qd vanishes for the bipartition a with bc , i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "however , by discarding subsystem c , we obtain @xmath73 , which mixes nonorthogonal states for subsystem b. we then obtain a nonvanishing qd between a and b , which is given by @xmath74",
    ". however , the monogamy trade - off @xmath75 keeps still valid , since gqd turns out to be equal to @xmath76 , namely , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "hence , we obtain a monogamous behavior as given by inequality  ( [ mon2 ] ) , with saturation achieved for this state .",
    "let us illustrate the monogamy bound  ( [ monogamybound ] ) in the case of multipartite pure states @xmath79 that admit schmidt decomposition , whose explicit conditions of existence are discussed in ref .",
    "we will assume that the system is composed by a set of qubits .",
    "in such a case , we can write @xmath80 , where @xmath81 are orthonormal bases , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . for the density operator @xmath84",
    ", we obtain @xmath85 since schmidt decomposition implies equal spectrum for all single - qubit reduced density operators @xmath86 , we obtain that @xmath87 , for any individual subsystem @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the mutual information is @xmath89 . in order to consider measurements @xmath48 over @xmath33",
    ", it can be shown that , by adopting projective ( von neumann ) measurements , the minimization of the loss of correlation is obtained in schmidt basis , namely , @xmath90 .",
    "this is a consequence of both the group homomorphism of @xmath91 to @xmath92 and the monotonicity of entropy under majorization ( see discussion for the state @xmath93 in ref .",
    ". then , @xmath94 , which implies @xmath95 . moreover @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the mutual information after measurement is @xmath97 , which implies that @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the sum of pairwise qds is upper limited by the von neumann entropy @xmath99 of an individual subsystem , which holds for quantum systems composed of an arbitrary number @xmath8 of qubits . as an example , consider the ghz state for @xmath8 qubits , namely , @xmath100 . for this state",
    ", we obtain @xmath101 ( independently of @xmath8 ) and vanishing pairwise correlations @xmath102 , which is in agreement with theorem  [ t3 ] .",
    "let us now consider a tripartite system @xmath1 described by the w - ghz state @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "note that , for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , we have pure states , given by @xmath108 and @xmath109 states , respectively .",
    "therefore , by adopting projective measurements , we will have that @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "as @xmath112 increases , we numerically find out a monotonic increase of gqd until @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "this can be seen as a consequence of the absence of schmidt decomposition for the @xmath115 state , which leaves gqd unconstrained by the entropy of an individual subsystem . for the complete range of @xmath112 , we plot gqd in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] as well as the pairwise sum @xmath31 + @xmath116 .",
    "we observe that monogamy as given by inequality  ( [ mon2 ] ) is obeyed for any @xmath112 , with distinct minimizing bases @xmath117 for gqd and pairwise qd .",
    "note also from the plot that the bound is considerably tight in the sense that , for any @xmath112 , the value of gqd is sufficiently limited to ensure that the subsystems are _ not _ freely correlated .",
    "the monogamy bound  ( [ mon2 ] ) allows for the definition of a measure @xmath118 for _ residual _ multipartite quantum correlations , namely , contributions to quantum correlations beyond pairwise qd .",
    "this is similar to the definition of _ tangle _ as a measure of residual multipartite entanglement  @xcite .",
    "indeed , let us consider the particular case of tripartite permutation invariant states , such the w - ghz state .",
    "in such a case , we can define the residual qd as @xmath119 note that , by considering the non - increasing behavior of qd under discard of subsystems ( such as in the w - ghz state ) , monogamy is ensured , implying that @xmath120 .",
    "if permutation invariance is absent , the tripartite residual correlations can be defined by @xmath121 , where minimization is taken over all subsystem permutations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar definition in the case of entanglement ) . applying the residual measure for the ghz state",
    ", it follows that @xmath122 , since pairwise contributions vanish . for the w state ,",
    "residual qd is lower than in the case of the ghz state , since pairwise qd is nonvanishing .",
    "indeed , it can be be shown that @xmath123 ( with the minimizing measurement found in the @xmath124 eigenbasis ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath125 .",
    "this behavior is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and is in agreement with the hierarchy found in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a monogamy bound for pairwise quantum correlations based on the amount of gqd available to a multipartite system .",
    "remarkably , this monogamy inequality holds for general states whose bipartite quantum discord is non - increasing under discard of subsystems .",
    "in particular , oppositely to the typical monogamy bound  ( [ mon1 ] ) , it covers both ghz and w tripartite classes of states , providing therefore a promising setup for the investigation of measures for multipartite classical and quantum residual correlations .",
