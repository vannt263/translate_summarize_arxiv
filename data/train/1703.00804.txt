    "quantum information theory has impacted in many ways our knowledge on how information may be stored , manipulated , and transmitted @xcite .",
    "much of its achievements were consequence of a unique type of correlation among physical systems exhibited only by the quantum systems , namely the entanglement .",
    "this is , for instance , the resource that enables information to be transmitted in an unparalleled and secure fashion as shown in quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite , respectively .",
    "another remarkable application of entanglement is the quantum communication protocol called dense coding , proposed by bennett and wiesner @xcite .",
    "they have shown that if two parts share this resource , one part can send more information to another than would be possible without entanglement .",
    "the simplest example of this protocol works as follows : alice , the sender , and bob , the receiver , share a pair of qubits ( two - level systems ) in a known maximally entangled bell state .",
    "she performs , on her qubit , one of the four unitaries @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 given by the identity and the pauli operators , respectively .",
    "each of these local unitary operations maps the initial two - qubit state into one of the four orthogonal bell states , which then can be used to encode two bits of information . after this encoding",
    ", alice sends her qubit to bob who can extract these two bits of information by performing a bell - state measurement on both qubits in his possession .",
    "therefore , by sending a single qubit , part of a shared maximally entangled pair , alice is able to communicate two bits of classical information to bob .",
    "if there was no entanglement , a single qubit would enable just one bit of information to be transmitted between them .",
    "likewise any other quantum information protocol that relies on maximally entangled states to work perfectly , dense coding is also affected when the entanglement shared between alice and bob is not maximal . in this scenario , many schemes have been proposed to optimize the protocol @xcite .",
    "we can divide these schemes into two main lines of investigation . in the first , one optimizes the encoding / decoding processes while trying to transmit the same amount of information that would be possible with a maximally entangled state @xcite . in the second ,",
    "one seeks to maximize the number of perfectly distinguishable messages that can be encoded and transmitted through the shared entangled state @xcite .- level systems ) , this number will be intermediate between the one achieved by a maximally entangled and a non - entangled state . for qubits ,",
    "this number would be 3 , but as shown in @xcite , it is impossible to encode three perfectly distinguishable messages in any partially entangled two - qubit state . ]",
    "our work follows the first line of investigation and , in this context , we assume that alice s encoding scheme will be the standard one presented in the original dense coding proposal @xcite . this encoding , performed with a set of orthogonal unitary operators . ] applied with equal _ a priori _ probabilities , maximizes the information transmission capacity of the protocol , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .    within the framework established above ,",
    "the set of possible classical messages encoded by alice will not be perfectly distinguishable due to the non - orthogonality of the quantum states carrying them .",
    "what remains is to optimize bob s decoding process , i.e. , to find the measurement strategy which optimally discriminates among these non - orthogonal states .",
    "so far , this problem has been approached in two ways :    * bob implements a measurement which _ always _ infers alice s message and minimizes the inevitable error in doing so .",
    "this strategy admits no failure probability and , as shown in @xcite , it maximizes the mutual information between them in the dense coding . *",
    "bob implements a measurement that infers alice s message _ without _ error , but only with a certain success probability , which must be maximized in order to optimize the process .",
    "in case of failure , nothing else is done .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this strategy provides full confidence in identifying the non - perfectly distinguishable messages at the cost of reducing the mutual information between them in comparison with the case ( i ) .    the decoding processes ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "are implemented via minimum - error ( me ) and maximum - confidence ( mc ) measurements , respectively .",
    "reviews on these discrimination strategies may be found in refs .",
    "the field of quantum - state discrimination has rapidly evolved in the last years , becoming a fundamental tool in quantum information theory .",
    "many new optimized measurement strategies have been proposed @xcite and applied in protocols like , for instance , quantum teleportation @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite .    here",
    ", we propose the application of the probabilistic discrimination strategies introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite by one of us and co - workers , in the decoding process of the dense coding protocol .",
    "firstly , we present a family of probabilistic decoding schemes which include ( i ) and ( ii ) described above as special cases and continuously interpolate between them .",
    "it is implemented via quantum - state separation , namely a map that transforms the states carrying part of alice s message into more distinguishable states , with an optimal success probability @xcite . after a successful event ,",
    "the decoding is accomplished with a me measurement .",
    "this scheme allows bob to trade - off between the level of confidence he wishes to identify alice s messages and the success probability for this task .",
    "the second group of probabilistic decoding schemes applies _ only _ for dense coding with qudits .",
    "it relies on the following fact : after a failed discrimination attempt in a probabilistic strategy , the qudit states , in general , still carry information about the input states .",
    "thus , they can be subjected to further discrimination attempts and the process may be iterated @xcite .",
    "we call this process multistage decoding and show that it improves over scheme ( ii ) increasing the mutual information between alice and bob .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    ". if these errors are below the unavoidable errors from other sources ( e.g. , imperfect communication channel and detection ) , she will remain undetected .",
    "* if eve chooses to apply mc strategy ( sect .",
    "[ sec : separation ] for @xmath117 ) , she will learn the key with much more confidence .",
    "however , since the overall probability of identifying the states incorrectly is always larger than in the me strategy , she will introduce a higher error rate .",
    "thus , she could be detected more easily .    how the discrimination strategies studied in sects .",
    "[ sec : separation ] and [ sec : multi - stage ] would fit in this problem ?",
    "first of all , since both are probabilistic , the errors in identifying the states are always larger than in the deterministic me strategy @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the error rate introduced by eve would always be higher than in ( i ) should she applies any of those strategies",
    ". however , there may still be advantages in using them :    * if eve chooses to apply the state separation ( sect .",
    "[ sec : separation ] for @xmath178 ) followed by a me measurement , she can trade - off ( by setting the distinguishability parameter @xmath116 ) between the level of confidence in learning the key and the error rate introduced in the protocol .",
    "the former would be larger than in ( i ) and the latter , lower than in ( ii ) . * if eve chooses to apply the multistage decoding ( sect .",
    "[ sec : multi - stage ] ) , she will have the chance of learning the key with as much confidence as in ( ii ) and , at the same time , to introduce a lower error rate .",
    "this is because the overall error probability in identifying the states is reduced in comparison with a single - stage mc measurement .",
    "therefore , for high - dimensional qkd  considering the b92 protocol using symmetric states ",
    "alice and bob must be aware of these many discrimination strategies which eve can implement to get the key . with this knowledge , they will be able to establish the range of errors introduced by a possible eavesdropper adopting any of these strategies and hence , to detect his / her presence .",
    "in summary , we revisited the problem of dense coding with non - maximally entangled states for protocols adopting the standard encoding method . using the recent advances in the field of quantum - state discrimination",
