    "heavy - fermion compounds are well - known candidates for a search and investigation of unconventional superconductivity . in these three dimensional systems ,",
    "the symmetry analysis of the possible superconducting state , depending on the crystalline lattice of the compound @xcite , sets the frame for the identification of the unconventional superconducting phase .",
    "this analysis gives a complete list of possible superconducting phases together with their properties determined by symmetry , including the type and order of nodes in the superconducting gap . in spite of a favorable theoretical situation and numerous experimental work ,",
    "there does nt exist yet a firm and widely accepted identification of these superconducting phases ( comparable to the results on superfluid @xmath2he ) in any heavy fermion superconductor .    in this paper , we examine the upper critical field @xmath3 of the heavy fermion superconductor ube@xmath1 as a probe of the symmetry of its superconducting phase .",
    "the upper critical field is usually not very sensitive to gap nodes ( see for example the quantitative studies for various scenarios in upd@xmath4al@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "but it is sensitive to the spin state of the cooper pairs or more generally to the parity of the order parameter , because in heavy fermion systems , the orbital limitation is so large that @xmath3 may be governed by the paramagnetic limitation .",
    "ube@xmath1 is a cubic compound with a @xmath6 of order 1k , and it is a non - magnetic superconductor . since the first measurements of its upper critical field @xcite , it is known that it presents two very unusual and intriguing features .",
    "first , @xmath3(t ) has a strong negative curvature close to @xmath6 which changes sign at intermediate fields .",
    "then , taking account of a realistic value of the conduction electrons gyromagnetic @xmath7 , the paramagnetic limit at t=0 is exceeded several times , while the strong negative curvature close to @xmath6 shows that there exist a pronounced effect of the paramagnetic limitation .",
    "numerous explanations have been proposed since the first precise measurements of @xmath0 in this compound @xcite .",
    "some have relied on additional hypothetic magnetic phase transitions @xcite , or on the field dependence of the normal state properties @xcite . but none of these phenomenological interpretations have found a firm basis in other measurements or theoretical developments .",
    "another hypothesis , much closer to the point of view adopted here , relies on two different superconducting order parameters with a weak pauli limitation @xcite .",
    "it has not been carried out quantitatively , but experimental support has been seeked through the detection of a possible second phase transition already in zero field below the main superconducting transition @xcite . to our opinion , such a second phase transition is not supported by the data , which only show a weak and smeared maximum in the specific heat or minimum in the thermal expansion .",
    "the model that we propose here involves a mixture of two different irreducible representations , but does not rely on nor predict such a second phase transition .    at present",
    ", the only competing quantitative explanation relies on a simple strong - coupling model @xcite .",
    "it has been also successful in describing the evolution of both features up to pressures of 20 kbars @xcite : the complete temperature and pressure dependence of @xmath3 comes out from a straightforward strong - coupling calculation with a single even parity state .",
    "the conflict with the paramagnetic limit at t=0 is resolved by its enhancement due both to direct strong - coupling effects ( increase of the ratio @xmath8 ) and to the ( parameter free ) inclusion of the formation of a spatially modulated superconducting state ( fflo ) , induced by the dominance of the paramagnetic limitation .",
    "very good agreement with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite is provided in the whole pressure range , for @xmath9 being close to its free electron value , by fitting the strong coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath10 agrees with that of the effective masses ( as indicated by the sommerfeld coefficient or the slope of @xmath3 at @xmath6 ) , but it also turns out to be exceptionaly large : @xmath11 at p=0 . for all other known superconductors where the strong coupling regime due to electron - phonon interaction is well characterized",
    ", @xmath10 does not exceed 5 .    the model in this paper",
    "is based on a field - induced mixture of two odd - parity irreducible representations of the symmetry group ( @xmath12 ) of the normal phase of ube@xmath1 .",
    "this possibility was already evoked in the literature @xcite , but it has not been worked out to the extent that it could justify the particular choice of the order parameters and could be compared directly with the experimental data . here , the choice of the two representations is unique , thus providing a firm identification scheme for the superconducting state of ube@xmath1 . within this scheme ,",
    "the dominant component of the order parameter is analogous to the b - phase of the superfluid @xmath2he .",
    "we make a quantitative comparison of the theoretical predictions with the data of ref.@xcite and propose an experimental check of the suggested scheme .",
    "as we shall see , our choice of order parameters does not allow for a consistent interpretation of all data in ube@xmath1 : in particular , it does not predict any nodes of the gap , whereas both old @xcite and new @xcite thermodynamic experiments hint at the presence of point nodes .",
    "we consider this approach as a first step which may help to clarify at least one aspect of the properties of ube@xmath1 , bearing in mind that the complexity of the physics of heavy fermion systems rarely allows for fully satisfying explanations ",
    "rotational symmetry of the crystalline lattice of ube@xmath1 is described by the @xmath12 group . following the list of ref .",
    "@xcite for strong spin orbit coupling , we have to consider 10 irreducible representations : @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 .",
    "the subscripts g and u denote correspondingly even or odd symmetry of the particular representation with respect to the inversion .",
    "the even representations are the analogs of the spin singlet pairing and the odd - of the spin triplet .",
    "the order parameter for an even representation is a scalar and for the odd - a vector function of the direction in the momentum space @xmath18 .",
    "the capital letters denote a - one - dimensional , e - two - dimensional and f - three - dimensional representations .",
    "to determine which of the representations is realized as the order parameter in a particular compound , one has to know the projections of the scattering amplitude @xmath19 of quasiparticles in the normal phase on the basis functions of these representations .",
    "the scattering amplitude is then represented in the form : @xmath20 the spin matrices are defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 , are pauli matrices .",
    "the sums are taken over all even and odd representations respectively .",
    "the greatest of the positive amplitudes @xmath26 ( the dominant one ) determines the temperature of the real superconducting transition @xmath27 as prescribed by the bcs - theory @xmath28 where @xmath29 is euler s constant , @xmath30 a cut - off parameter and n(0 ) the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "all other amplitudes are subdominant .",
    "the transformation properties of the order parameter not too far from @xmath27 are described by the representation @xmath31 .",
    "a magnetic field ( h ) changes the symmetry of the system and the classification of the representations .",

    "@xcite , if the direction of the field h coincides with the symmetry axis of the lattice , the different branches are classified by two quantum numbers .",
    "the first is n = m+n , where m is the projection of angular momentum on the direction of field and n is the number of the landau level , which describes the spatial dependence of the order parameter for the nucleating superconducting region .",
    "the second quantum number is the parity @xmath32 with respect to reflection in the plane perpendicular to the direction of h. the branch with the highest h for a given t determines the true @xmath3(t)(t ) starting from @xmath6 and corresponding to different n , but one knows that the highest branch corresponds to n=0 . ]",
    "the dependence @xmath3(t ) for p - wave pairing has been analyzed in detail by scharnberg and klemm @xcite .",
    "no change of sign of the curvature was found , which is natural in a problem with only one parameter @xmath26 .",
    "but if all terms are retained in the sum ( [ scatamp ] ) , the magnetic field has an additional effect : it can mix basis functions having the same quantum number n , which originally belonged to different representations . substantial change of the original basis functions can take place for fields of order @xmath33 .",
    "a change of the basis functions will change the projections @xmath34 on these functions , including the projection which determines the superconducting transition",
    ". a substantial admixture of the subdominant coefficients @xmath35 may therefore also take place on energy scales @xmath36 , imitating an extreme strong coupling effect . as regard",
    "the field induced change of the interaction potential itself , it is of the order of @xmath37 and can be neglected .",
    "the minimum model which can include these effects must contain two representations well mixed by the magnetic field .",
    "an advantage of the minimum model is that it remains tractable and contains only one additional parameter .",
    "whether or not the two - representations model is sufficiently accurate for a description of the magnetic properties of a particular superconductor depends on the values of coefficients in the sum ( [ scatamp ] ) for this material , and on the temperature interval in which one expects to reproduce these properties . in what follows ,",
    "we apply the two - representation model to reproduce the unusual temperature dependence of @xmath3 in ube@xmath1 .",
    "we use the above mentioned characteristic features of this dependence as a guidance for the choice of two dominating representations .",
    "the critical magnetic field can exceed the paramagnetic limit if the order parameter in the high field region is predominantly of the odd - parity type ( i.e. a vector - function @xmath18 ) , and if the projection of @xmath18 on the magnetic field is small or absent . to provide a good mixing of the two participating representations by the magnetic field we assume that both representations are of the odd - parity type . the pronounced paramagnetic effect in the low field region",
    "indicates that in that region the order parameter is dominated by a one - dimensional representation . in that case",
    "it is not possible to eliminate completly one projection of @xmath18 .",
    "such an elimination becomes possible in strong fields when the admixture of the second representation is appreciable .",
    "an inspection of the representation table for the @xmath12 group with the corresponding basis functions @xcite suggests the following scheme : the superconducting phase which appears at h=0 and t=@xmath27 belongs to the @xmath38 representation with the basis function @xmath39 the unit vectors @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are directed along three mutually perpendicular four - fold axes of the cube .",
    "the order parameter of the form ( [ a1u ] ) corresponds to a state of spin s=1 , orbital momentum l=1 and total angular momentum j=0 .",
    "this is the most symmetric odd - parity state , which is analogous to the b - phase of superfluid @xmath2he .",
    "the superconducting gap for that state has the full symmetry of the @xmath12 group and it does not have nodes required by symmetry .",
    "we assume in what follows that the magnetic field is oriented along the z - direction .",
    "only one branch of @xmath3(t ) starts from @xmath27 ( ignoring higher landau levels ) and this branch is characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the second representation is @xmath45 . for the present discussion it is convenient to choose the basis functions of @xmath45 in the following form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a cubic root of 1 .",
    "@xmath48 transforms as a function with m=0 , and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "one can see immediately that the z - component of the combination @xmath51 is zero and the paramagnetic limitation is absent for such an order parameter .",
    "the elimination of the z - component would not be possible for the @xmath52 representation , since as a function of @xmath53 it is orthogonal to z - components of the basis functions of all other odd representations .",
    "so , we assume that the pairing potential contains contributions of only two representations @xmath38 and @xmath45 .",

    "first of all , we note that the two - representations ( @xmath38 , @xmath45 ) model can reproduce the unusual features of @xmath0 in ube@xmath1 .",
    "good quantitative agreement is obtained everywhere except in high fields .",
    "at least two reasons can be invoked for the observed deviations : the effect of the omitted representations in equation ( [ scatamp2 ] ) is expected to become stronger in the low temperature range , and the strong coupling effects , known to exist in this compound ( @xcite ) , have been neglected in our calculations and would also reinforce @xmath0 in this temperature range @xcite .",
    "so these deviations can be ascribed to some oversimplifications of our model , without fundamentally questionning its validity .",
    "the fitting parameters have realistic values .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath103 is in agreement with that of the sommerfeld coefficient ( deduced from ref .",
    "this is not a surprise , as this feature is almost model independent and it has been already pointed out in ref .",
    "the effective @xmath7 increases slowly from 1.2 to 1.5 and is not too far from the free electron value . in the absence of any other probe of @xmath9 ,",
    "no additionnal cross - checking seems possible .",
    "the more characteristic parameter of the model is the ratio @xmath57/@xmath27 .",
    "pronounced effect of the subdominant interaction via admixture of the second representation is observed even when the temperature of the subdominant transition @xmath57 is much smaller than the real transition temperature @xmath27 . at ambient pressure",
    "@xmath57/@xmath27 is of the order of 0.1 , whereas it grows linearly with pressure in the interval @xmath106 , up to a value of 0.7 .",
    "extrapolation of this dependence in a region of higher pressures predicts a crossover of the two temperatures at @xmath107 . for @xmath108 , @xmath57 would be larger than @xmath27 and the transition in zero magnetic field will take place in one of the three possible phases belonging to the @xmath45 representation @xcite .",
    "an experimental observation of this crossover would be a good check of the proposed two - representation scheme .",
    "the details of the crossover ( if observed ) could give support to the proposed choice of the two representations .",
    "the observed qualitative changes ( suppression of the upturn ) of the curve @xmath3(t ) with increasing pressure are easily understood within the proposed scheme . when @xmath57 approaches @xmath27 , two representations can be considered as one three - dimensional representation , in which case the paramagnetic limitation",
    "can already be suppressed in low fields by a suitable combination of the basis functions , and no upturn will appear . a possibility to fit better the experimental curve when @xmath57 ( and v@xmath109 ) is growing is also natural , since in that case the role of the omitted representation is getting relatively smaller",
    ".    eventually , let us note the difference between our model and the two transition proposal of ref . @xcite . in the latter one",
    ", it is proposed that a second transition is present below @xmath110 , and that the upturn comes from the apparition of a new phase with a weaker pauli limitation .",

    ", the second phase ( the @xmath45 representation ) does not appear in zero field - zero pressure .",
    "it is only the applied field which introduces the mixture of the representations at finite temperatures ( see fig . [",
    "fig : n1-n2 ] ) .",
    "a new phase transition is avoided precisely because the field allows such a mixture without additionnal symmetry breaking .",
    "the present scenario , in addition to providing quantitative predictions , also has the advantage of giving a realistic account of the smoothness of all features observed below @xmath27 in ube@xmath1 .",
    "the proposed scheme satisfactory explains the temperature dependence of @xmath3(t ) in ube@xmath1 , but it is in conflict with the observed power - law temperature dependencies of the specific heat , london penetration depth and of the longitudinal relaxation time in nmr - experiments @xcite which reveal the existence of gap nodes : with the @xmath38 order parameter , the nodes in the superconducting gap can only be accidental . the argument given above for the choice of the representations indeed leaves no other possibility than this @xmath111 mixture among odd representations .",
    "there remains a possibility of a mixture of even and odd representations @xcite .",
    "the choice of possible pairs of competing representations in that case is much bigger .",
