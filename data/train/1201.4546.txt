    "the accelerating expansion of the universe has been established by several cosmological observations , such as those from type ia supernovae  @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , large scale structure  @xcite and weak lensing  @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to explain this phenomenon .",
    "one is to add dark energy to modify matter and the other one is to modify gravity in the einstein s equation . the simplest version for the latter is @xmath0 gravity  @xcite , which is by extending the ricci scalar of @xmath2 to a function of @xmath0 in the einstein - hilbert action . as a result , the late time accelerating universe can be realized in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "many viable @xmath0 gravity models have been constructed by satisfying various conditions as well as constraints from cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "the finite - time singularity problems  @xcite have been examined in many modified theories , such as @xmath0 models  @xcite , modified gauss - bonnet models  @xcite , @xmath3 models  @xcite , modified horava - lifshitz gravity  @xcite and non - local gravity models  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that some of the viable @xmath0 models contain one kind of the finite - time singularities , leading to a divergence of curvature , but it can be avoided by taking a fine - tune initial condition  @xcite .",
    "however , this kind of singularities must be induced and can not be avoided when the local background density of matter becomes dense @xcite .",
    "even though the singularity depends on the background density as well as the model parameters , it happens in a finite time .",
    "this behavior could exist in many physical systems , such as cluster , galaxy , nebula collide , and star collapse .",
    "however , if an additional @xmath4 term with @xmath5 is introduced in the viable @xmath0 models  @xcite , the singularity can be avoided .",
    "we note that adding the @xmath6 term to the viable @xmath0 gravity models could also lead to the unification of dark energy with inflation  @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the curvature singularity arises naturally in the viable @xmath0 models unless some fine - tuning is taken  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first show the singularity problem in the popular viable @xmath0 models and then try to modify them to remove the singularity .",
    "we will explore the possible cosmological consequences in these modified models under the minkowski background .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the scalar mode of gravitational waves  @xcite , which is a characteristic signature to distinguish @xmath0 gravity from general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "we will also show that the minkowski approach still holds when the curvature close to the singularity .",
    "we use the natural unit @xmath7 with @xmath8 and the metric @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : oscillation ] , we study the curvature oscillation in the viable @xmath0 gravity models with a highly dense background . in sec .  [",

    "the scalar mode of gravitational waves is also discussed .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the action of @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the action of matter , @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the matter field with the minimal coupling to gravity , and @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath2 . by varying the action ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to @xmath12 , we obtain equation of motion @xmath16 where @xmath17 , the subscript @xmath2 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the covariant derivative , @xmath21 is the dalembertian operator , and @xmath22 is the matter energy - momentum tensor from the local matter distribution .      it has been widely accepted that a viable @xmath0 gravity model has to satisfy the following conditions  @xcite : ( a ) @xmath23 for @xmath24 , which keeps the positivity of the effective gravitational coupling and avoids anti - gravity , where @xmath25 is the present background curvature ; ( b ) @xmath26 for @xmath24 , which gives the stability condition of cosmological perturbations ; ( c ) @xmath27 in the large curvature regime ( @xmath28 ) , which realizes the @xmath29 behavior at @xmath28 ; ( d ) a stable late - time de - sitter point ; and ( e ) passing local gravity constraints , including those from the equivalence principle and solar system . under these conditions , many viable @xmath0 models have been proposed @xcite . in table",
    "[ table : models ] , we give the explicit forms of the popular viable @xmath0 models in the literature  @xcite , where ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) correspond to hu - sawicki @xcite , starobinsky @xcite , tsujikawa @xcite , the exponential gravity @xcite and appleby - battye ( ab ) @xcite models , respectively .    0.2 in [ table : models ]    .explicit forms of @xmath0 in ( i ) hu - sawicki , ( ii ) starobinsky , ( iii ) tsujikawa , ( iv ) the exponential gravity , and ( v ) ab viable models [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the physical system , we can estimate the order of @xmath30 in different background densities in the modified type - ii @xmath0 models . under the natural selection of the mass factor @xmath31 , leading to @xmath32",
    "we find that @xmath33 , where we have assumed @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is a very low energy density since the physical density , such as that in the inner galaxy regime , is much larger . as a result ,",
    "it is hard to detect the oscillation behavior and scalar mode of gravitational waves in the type - ii @xmath0 models . on the other hand , the curvature oscillation and scalar mode of gravitational waves",
    "could still be detected in the modified type - i @xmath0 models .",
    "note that the amplitude depends on both @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see figs .",
    "[ fg:5]a and [ fg:5]c ) .",
    "the galaxy collision takes billions years ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , so that @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "the curvature oscillation and scalar mode of gravitational waves can only be observed for a small value of @xmath44 as it corresponds to @xmath45 , which can be estimated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : prevhsspara ] ) with @xmath46 .",
    "for example , for the inner galaxy ( sun ) with the density @xmath47 , one finds that @xmath48 . in the above discussions",
    ", we have assumed the flat space - time .",
    "now , we would check whether this approach is valid or not when the curvature becomes large .",
    "if the high density region is described by the locally homogeneous and isotropic frw metric , one has the form of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the scale factor .",
    "then , the gravitational field ( friedmann ) equation is given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the hubble constant . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : friedmann1 ] ) , the second term of is approximately equal to a constant curvature of @xmath54 , which is much smaller than the first term ( @xmath55 ) , while the third term is @xmath56 as the large curvature oscillation corresponds to a small @xmath57 , we can estimate each quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimh2 ] ) . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : prevplnum ] ) approximately describes a simple harmonic oscillator @xmath58 for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , leading to the oscillating frequency @xmath61 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath62 . consequently , the order of the oscillation amplitude of @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimh2 ] ) is @xmath64 .",
    "similarly , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : friedmann2 ] ) , the oscillation amplitude of @xmath65 is dominated by @xmath66 , which has the same order as the curvature oscillation amplitude : @xmath67 as a result , the singularity behavior comes from the small amplitude and high frequency of the scale factor oscillation .",
    "hence , the result still holds under in the flat space - time limit .",
    "explicitly , the covariant derivative yields the same result as the partial derivative , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .    ll    finally , it is worth to mention that the amplitude of @xmath70 would be converge if @xmath71 in the original type - i @xmath0 models without the @xmath1 term as shown in fig .  [ fg:7 ] .",
    "this result can be seen as the time reversion of @xmath72 .",
    "this kind of singularity does not exist in the cosmological evolution .",
    "we have demonstrated that the singularity appears in the finite time in the viable @xmath0 gravity models .",
    "however , this singularity could be avoided by adding the @xmath73 term with @xmath5 into the lagrangian .",
    "we have explicitly shown the cases with the most reasonable parameters of @xmath40 and @xmath74 . even though we can prevent the divergence",
    ", the oscillation behavior still exists .",
    "if the oscillating amplitude is large enough , it would be detected by cosmological observations . the oscillating effect in the different scale",
    "depends on the types of @xmath0 models .",
    "in particular , in the type - i models the effect can be induced in inner galaxy regime , but it is hard to distinguish the type - ii models from gr .    as the simplest example , the scalar mode of gravitational waves is a typical phenomenon , which is different from gr , and it has the same origin as the curvature oscillation . as shown , the type - i viable @xmath0 models can give good sources of the scalar gravitational waves when @xmath75 .",
    "however , if @xmath44 is too large ( the case of @xmath76 leads to @xmath77 with the inner galaxy regime ) or the background is too dense ( denser than the solar density ) , the amplitude stays in a stable small fluctuation regime and it can not be the source of the scalar mode . this behavior does not appear in the type - ii viable @xmath0 models , because the factor @xmath30 is too large when @xmath78 .",
    "this is still a very low density regime and hence , the energy of the scalar mode of gravitational waves  @xcite can not be emitted .",
