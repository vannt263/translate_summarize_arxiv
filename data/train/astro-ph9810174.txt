    "3 of komossa & schulz 1998 ; for a discussion of aligned x - ray sources in / around nearby galaxies see e.g. arp 1997 , radecke 1997 ) .",
    "we produced long- and short - term x - ray lightcurves for both sources . whereas the emission from the core of ngc1365 and ngc1365x1 is constant within the errors on short timescales , that of ngc1365x1 is strongly variable on a longer timescale .",
    "a clear detection during the first hri observation in 1994 was followed by a non - detection one year later implying a countrate drop by more than a factor 2 . for a comparison of the hri counts with the pspc and data",
    ", we converted the counts from the latter instruments to equivalent hri counts , assuming a spectral shape as estimated in i97 ( @xmath65 and their galactic @xmath23 = 0.1510@xmath28 @xmath21 ; see also our sect .",
    "the following countrates are obtained : @xmath66 = 0.0014 ( pspc-2 ; 2/1993 ) , 0.0026 ( hri-1 ; 7/94 ) , 0.0095 ( _ asca _ ; 1/95 ) , @xmath15 0.001 cts / s ( hri-2 ; 7/95 ) .",
    "so far , the highest known state , corresponding to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath67 erg / s at the distance of ngc1365 , was reached during the observation ( i97 ) .",
    "half a year later , during the hri-2 observation , the source had dropped by a factor @xmath68 10 as compared to the ` high state ' .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve is displayed in fig .",
    "[ light_offn ] .",
    "given the extraordinary properties of ngc1365x1 , we made several checks to test the robustness of the results ( concerning amplitude of variability , derived luminosity , assumed spectrum ) :    \\(i ) first , we note , that measurements with the _ same _ instrument under similar conditions exhibit clear variability of the source : it is only detected in one out of the two hri observations which have the same exposure time and pointing direction .",
    "ngc1365x1 is immediately visible in the first exposure , but absent in the second .",
    "a similar argument holds for the two asca observations of i97 .",
    "\\(ii ) the total _ amplitude _ of variability depends on the inter - instrument countrate conversion ( from -sis to -hri ) . to test the reliability of the conversion",
    ", we also converted the countrate of the central source ( which did not show variability during the or the observations ) to hri countrate and we find good agreement .",
    "( explicitly , starting with cr = 0.023 cts / s ( sis ) and assuming constant spectral shape ( we used the rs model ) , we derive @xmath69 = 0.017@xmath58 , in agreement with the observed value of 0.019@xmath57 . )    \\(iii ) the _ luminosity _ of the source depends on the assumed spectral shape and is particularly sensitive to the value of cold absorption .",
    "i97 used the galactic @xmath23 only , which corresponds to a lower limit on source luminosity . to get a crude spectral shape in the band",
    ", we used the on - axis pspc observation ( pspc-2 ) and extracted source photons in a circle around ngc1365x1 .",
    "a potential problem is the closeness to the nuclear source , and the weakness of the target source .",
    "clearly aware of being at the limit of the applicability of the chi - square fit procedure , we fit a powerlaw to the source spectrum .",
    "in a first step , we fixed @xmath23 to the galactic value .",
    "we derived a photon index of @xmath70 which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath71 .",
    "we then repeated the spectral fit for a second background region ; the results are the same within the errors .",
    "this insensitivity to the background chosen also implies that a potential contribution to the x - ray spectrum from other spiral arm sources in ngc1365 or weak extended emission from the fornax cluster is negligible .",
    "we note that the observed ( isotropic ) high - state luminosity is a _ lower _ limit to the total luminosity ( except if dominated by beaming ) since the source may not have been observed exactly at maximum light , and the x - ray spectrum may extend into the euv and/or have a soft excess added .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , we recall that a foreground or background object can not be ruled out at present .",
    "we consider this unlikely , though , due to the following reasons : ( a ) bright off - nuclear x - ray sources are being observed in more and more nearby galaxies ( the present case just seems to be an extreme one ) ; ( b ) foreground object ( e.g.  a galactic x - ray binary ) : given the high galactic lattitude of ngc1365 ( @xmath72 ) a chance coincidence has a low probability ; ( c ) background quasar : located behind the dusty / gaseous spiral arm seen at the position of ngc1365x1 , the cold absorbing column in the direction of a background object should significantly exceed the galactic value .",
    "however , the source is separately detected in the soft ( below 1 kev ) and the hard band .",
    "we again used the crude pspc spectrum described above , fixed = 1.9 and treated @xmath23 as free parameter for an order - of - magnitude estimate of its value .",
    "this yields @xmath73  @xmath21 and is consistent with the galactic value or only slightly larger .",
    "again , we repeated the spectral fit for the second background region and get the same results within the errors .",
    "cccc +   +   +   +   +   +",
    "a description of the soft x - ray spectrum in terms of a _ single _ pl ( sect.2.1 , see also fig .",
    "1 ) leaves systematic residuals suggesting the presence of a thermal component .",
    "unless metal abundances are strongly reduced ( a factor @xmath74 relative to cosmic ) a _ single _ rs model is unfeasible as well .",
    "all evidence from hii regions in ngc1365 ( alloin et al .",
    "1981 , roy & walsh 1988 , zaritsky et al .  1994",
    ", roy & walsh 1997 ) leads to an o / h and n / h of above - solar or close - to - solar values in the center and a slight decrease outwards .",
    "the shallowness of the gradient is explained by bar - induced _ strong mixing _ of the gas .",
    "hence , strongly depleted metal abundances in the central x - ray gas are unexpected so that the successful metal - reduced single - rs fit is considered as an unlikely solution.solar abundances see also buote & fabian ( 1998 ) . ]    in addition , the requirement of at least two components is in agreement with the data analysis by i97 . beyond the band they found a significant hard component which shows up as a very hot rs component ( @xmath75 kev ) in our rs+rs fit or is consistent with either a canonical pl ( @xmath76 ) plus a hot rs ( 1 kev ) or a flat ( @xmath42 ) pl and a ` moderate ' rs temperature ( 0.7 kev ) in our rs+pl fits .",
    "a warm - absorber model seen _ purely _ in absorption did not fit the spectrum , either suggesting the lack of highly ionized gas directly along the l.o.s or a very high column density .    aside from the amount of cold absorption , the two - component fits and the agn warm - scatterer model ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) are strikingly similar to our results for the ultraluminous ir galaxy ngc6240 ( schulz et al .",
    "1998 , komossa et al .  1998 ) in which we proposed an agn contribution in soft x rays . for ngc1365 ,",
    "however , one of the arguments , the huge luminosity , can not be used against generation of the total x - ray flux in a starburst induced scenario .",
    "our rs+pl@xmath48 model fit of the core source yields @xmath77 erg / s ( @xmath78 erg / s ) for @xmath23 free ( fixed to @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is at least twenty ( more likely more than forty ) times less luminous than the central source of ngc6240 .    in the following , to ease the luminosity demands , we use the solution for @xmath79 of which",
    "the rs contribution is @xmath80 erg / s or 52% of the total .",
    "the simplest idea one can have is to attribute the thermal rs component to a starburst source and the pl to the agn which means that they contribute in equal proportions in the band .",
    "we take these numbers as a working hypothesis clearly having in mind that a precise decomposition is not possible at the present stage of measurement resolution and theory .",
    "are we able to constrain the relative amounts of the agn and starburst contribution via multi - wavelength properties of ngc1365 ?",
    "firstly , we formed ir gradients @xmath81 from the iras flux densities @xmath82 ( labeled by wavelength : @xmath83 jy , @xmath84 jy , @xmath85 jy ( @xmath86 ; retrieved from ned ) at @xmath87 and 100@xmath88 m and checked the location of ngc1365 in the @xmath89 diagram . samples of seyfert class-1 , class-2 and hii - type objects in this diagram are shown in miley et al.(1985 ) and mulchaey et al.(1994 ) . with @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    ", ngc1365 lies in a region mainly occupied by hii - galaxies and seyfert-2 galaxies .",
    "the slope indices signify dominating flux at smaller wavelengths ( ` warm ' dust components ) , warmer than typical seyfert-1s in the mid - ir ( 25,60 ) and warmer than the _ average _ of hii region type galaxies in the far ir ( 100,60 ) , making the fir cool dust component ( that dominates in normal spirals ) insignificant .",
    "altogether this suggests that the ir emission comes from the central region where the agn and relatively young star formation components contribute a substantial portion of the observed ir emission in ngc1365 .",
    "its more x - ray and ir - luminous sister ngc6240 contains a much stronger cool - dust fir - component ( @xmath92 ) but has nearly the same gradient in the mid - ir ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "putting ngc1365 with @xmath94 into the scheme of heisler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows a discrepancy .",
    "this scheme assumes that objects with @xmath95 ( cold mid - ir , more edge - on view of torus ) should not even show a ` hidden ' blr .",
    "but ngc1365 clearly exhibits broad balmer lines . converting the ratio into a power - law index @xmath96 ( 4 corresponds to @xmath97 ) and checking mulchaey s et al .",

    "this could be a seyfert outflow , driven by a wind from the active core , or a starburst outflow , driven by a series of supernova explosions .",

    "assuming that starformation takes care of the rest we take the iras @xmath104 erg / s as an estimate for the bolometric luminosity of the starburst for which models from gehrz et al .",
    "( 1983 ) predict a sn rate between 0.01 and 1 yr@xmath105 ( depending on the imf and the lower and upper mass limits ) and @xmath106 in the range @xmath107 erg / s of which kristen et al .",
    "see only @xmath108 erg / s in the central region . hence ,",
    "90% to 99% of the h@xmath1 emitters ionized by young stars are hidden .",
    "could this hidden burst supply the x - rays in a wind driven shell ? from the velocity field in hjelm & lindblad ( 1996 ) we read off a radius @xmath109 kpc with a corresponding velocity @xmath110 km / s . with the thermal rs x - ray luminosity of @xmath80 erg / s",
    "we get the following solution of the maclow - mccray equations given in scaled form as in schulz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 here , @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115 erg / s or a sn rate of 0.015 yr@xmath105 which is consistent with the gehrz et al .",
    "starburst models .",
    "the expansion time @xmath116 corresponding to @xmath117 yrs and the density @xmath118 ( 1.2 @xmath119 ) are reasonable for the central region of this strong bar .",
    "we conclude that this crude scenario can account for the observed thermal x - ray luminosity if more than 90% of the ionized gas emitting optical lines in the starburst region is obscured . due to less clear constraints",
    "an analogous estimate for an agn wind is not attempted .",
    "we now compare the data with the sample of hard x - ray detected agn from piccinotti et al .",
    "concerning the two excellent agn tracers broad lines and hard x - rays this sample is homogeneous and comprises qsos , seyfert-1 galaxies and broad - line radio galaxies so that contributions by starburst components are minimized . for the piccinotti sample ,",
    "ward et al .",
    "( 1988 ) showed that the luminosities ( determined for @xmath120 km / s / mpc ) of hard x - rays , h@xmath1 and mid - ir - radiation from the flux parameter @xmath121 are well correlated ( their figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "we represent their results by the relations @xmath122 the scatter in the ordinate is @xmath123 for both relations .    for ngc1365 these quantities are observed to be ( cgs - quantities scaled to @xmath124=50 for the comparison ) : @xmath125 ( from i97 ) ; @xmath126 ( broad component measured by schulz et al .",
    "1994 ) ; @xmath127 ( derived from iras data given by ned ) .",
    "it turns out that these combinations of data do not fit the relations of the piccinotti sample for which we assume that it defines ` pure ' agn properties .",
    "e.g. , if the hard x - rays come from the agn in ngc1365 we would expect @xmath128 which is only 0.43% of the observed 44.87 .",
    "the remaining ir could either be attributed to star formation or the source for the hard 2 - 10 kev photons is for a large part obscured which would , however , require column densities exceeding @xmath129 @xmath21 .    utilizing the first piccinotti - sample relation of eq .  4 ,",
    "the x - rays predict @xmath130 , only 8.3% of the observed 40.82 .",
    "the data were taken at different epochs , so variability can not be excluded to explain part of the discrepancy . however , the data for the piccinotti sample were collected non - simultaneously as well and their total scatter corresponds to only a factor four .",
    "another possibiiity would be some arrangement of obscuring material in front of the x - ray source or / and the blr possibly combined with scattering elsewhere .",
    "compton thick and balmer electron - scattering highly ionized thick columns might as well be envisioned in the extreme environment of the nucleus , but detailed models are beyond the scope of this work . taking h@xmath1 as representative for the agn , @xmath131 , i.e.  ten times the observed hard x - ray luminosity , and @xmath132 , i.e.  2.5% of the observed mid - ir , would be predicted .",
    "this type of solution would fit to our warm scatterer model ( last model in sect.2.2 ) which could explain both the hard pspc ( and _ asca _ ) pl - like component and the high equivalent width of the fek complex ( like in ngc6240 , see komossa et al .",
    "1998 ) .    a crude upper limit for the contribution from a stationary agn would be one that dominates the mid - infrared , leading to the prediction of @xmath133 = 44.22 and 43.05 for the hard x - ray and h@xmath1 luminosities , respectively . in this case , the corresponding observed ( see above ) hard x - rays and h@xmath1 luminosities are 0.06% of the predicted ones requiring esentially complete obscuration of the emission - line and hard x - ray sources .",
    "such an extreme situation appears to be ruled out for ngc1365 because star formation is spatially extended over a diameter of @xmath134 and will provide an appreciable part of the ir .",
    "ngc1365 does not fulfill expectations of the simplest version of the unified model in which only the torus blocks the light and detection of a blr would imply an unobscured view of the x - ray source as well .",
    "complicated models appear to be necessary to let this agn be an _ intrinsically normal _ broad - line object .",
    "other , currently vague , possibilities would be that the agn in ngc1365 as a low - luminosity object is qualitatively different from the piccinotti objects or that this object is an example for non - mainstream scenarios , like the starburst - agn models developed by terlevich et al .",
    "however , such models have not yet been worked out to satisfactorily account for the hard x - ray data .",
    "ngc1365x1 is a bright x - ray source .",
    "the excellent spatial resolution of the rosat hri locates it on one of the spiral arms of ngc1365 .",
    "the source is highly variable on the timescale of months .    in sect .",
    "4 we already gave cautious comments on the possibility of a foreground or background source and considered it unlikely . in the following discussion , we assume the source to be intrinsic to ngc1365 . in this case , ngc1365x1 is one of the brightest off - nuclear point sources known , with an isotropic luminosity of @xmath135 erg / s ( for @xmath136 mpc ) in the source s observed high - state .",
    "off - nuclear x - ray sources , some of them variable , are frequently discovered in nearby galaxies ( e.g. fabbiano 1989 , vogler 1997 ; turner et al .",

    "1996 , vogler et al .",

    "1997 , immler et al .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are typically of order 10@xmath137 erg / s up to several 10@xmath138 erg / s . among the most x - ray bright",
    "observed sources in other galaxies are supernovae ( of type ii ; see e.g. the review by schlegel 1995 ) .",

    "1998 ) and 310@xmath139 erg / s ( sn 1986j , bregman & pildis 1992 ; all luminosities are as given by the authors ) . on long timescales ,",
    "variability is detected in some sn ( cf .",
    "schlegel 1995 ) . within our galaxy , one of the most luminous individual x - ray emitters is the superluminal - motion source grs 1915 + 105 with @xmath140 erg / s ( daily average during high - states ) and peak luminosities up to @xmath141 erg / s ( on a timescale of seconds ; greiner et al . 1998 ) .",
    "ngc1365x1 is exceptionally luminous .",
    "its temporal variability excludes an interpretation in terms of several spatially unresolved weak sources .",
    "another definitely bright ( @xmath142 erg / s ) source was found by vogler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in an outer spiral arm of ngc 4559 .",
    "they suggested an interpretation in terms of a ` buried supernova ' .",
    "in contrast to ngc1365x1 , this source did not show any x - ray variability .",
    "although a supernova in dense medium is an efficient way to reach high x - ray luminosities ( e.g. shull 1980 , wheeler et al .",
    "1980 , terlevich et al . 1992 ) , the huge variability on the timescale of months we detect seems to favour an interpretation in terms of accretion onto a compact object . the amplitude and rapidity of variability share similarity with the off - nuclear source in ngc4945 reported by brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . however , the present case is much more powerful , by at least a factor of @xmath4716 in luminosity .",
    "erg / s in the 0.82.4 kev band , ngc1365x1 shows @xmath143 erg / s in the same band . ]    at present , the most likely interpretation seems to be an ultra - powerful x - ray binary , with either a highly super - eddington low - mass black hole or a very massive black hole . the hard powerlaw component derived from the and spectral fits",
    "is known to be present in galactic x - ray binaries ( see tanaka 1997 for a recent review ) ; they have soft - excesses added in their high - states . in case",
    "the accretion is not super - eddington , a rather high - mass black hole of @xmath47100200 m@xmath144 is inferred which may pose a challenge for stellar evolution models .",
    "we studied the nuclear and circumnuclear x - ray emission of ngc1365 using pspc and hri observations .",
    "the hri image shows compact emission from the nucleus , from the highly variable southwestern source , and resolves the source just outside the sw spiral arm into a double source .",
    "the analysis of the spectral and temporal x - ray properties of the nucleus of ngc1365 and the enigmatic source rxj0333 - 3609 = ngc1365x1 is summarized as follows : + _ the core of ngc1365 . _ to describe the x - ray spectrum , we favour a two - component model consisting of about equally strong contributions from a raymond - smith ( rs ) plasma ( with @xmath47cosmic abundances ) and a powerlaw .",
    "although a single rs model yields a successful spectral fit as well , it requires heavily depleted metal abundances which seems to be in contradiction to optical observations .",
    "the powerlaw component signifies the presence of a hard component not common in simple starbursts ; this hard component as well as an fek line is also present in asca data of i97 strengthening the view that it arises in the agn .",
    "the thermal rs part of the x - ray spectrum is found to be consistent with being produced in starburst - induced superwind shocks if the starburst dominates the mid to far ir and its h@xmath1 emitters are largely hidden .    a detailed comparison of the x - ray properties with multi - wavelength observations of ngc1365 and a large sample of type - i agns was performed .",
    "we find that , if the hard x rays ( 210 kev ) or the broad h@xmath1 are representative tracers of the active nucleus in ngc1365 , they can only account for a minute amount of the ir ; or , conversely , if the ir were due to dust heating by the agn , the latter has to be essentially completely hidden .",
    "this and the large extent of the starformation region support the view that the ir is starburst dominated although emission - line h@xmath1 from the starburst has to be largely obscured as well .",
    "a puzzle is the low x - ray luminosity of ngc1365 as compared to the strength of the blr balmer line component ; this poses a problem for the simplest version of the unified model .",
    "in particular , a comparison with the piccinotti sample of type-1 agns strengthens the view that we see scattered x - rays in the 210 kev range .",
    "this is in line with our alternative successful x - ray spectral model of a warm scatterer ; highly photoionized and high column density material close to the agn continuum source .",
    "such a scenario , as alternative to a low - luminosity agn viewed directly , still requires a peculiar viewing geometry to simultaneously explain the observed strength of the broad lines .",

    ", the most likely interpretation seems to be an ultra - powerful x - ray binary . if this interpretation is confirmed , this or similar x - ray sources in nearby galaxies will be important probes for the extremes of stellar evolution .",
