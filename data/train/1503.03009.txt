    "toric codes @xcite proposed by kitaev are one of the most studied classes of topological quantum codes and of fundamental importance in fault tolerant quantum computing .",
    "although toric codes and their generalization  surface codes , have many attractive features ( such as local stabilizer generators , low complexity decoders , efficient fault tolerant protocols , a high circuit threshold @xcite ) , they have a limited set of transversal gates . on other hand , a class of topological color codes can implement the entire clifford group transversally @xcite .",
    "this might suggest that color codes are inequivalent to toric codes .",
    "however , in a very surprising development , bombin et al .",
    "@xcite showed that translationally invariant 2d color codes can be mapped to a finite number of copies of kitaev s toric code .",
    "however , the result in @xcite , as well the subsequent papers @xcite which explore the equivalence between stabilizer codes and toric codes in great detail , have one important qualifier , namely translational invariance . for 2d color codes , delfosse @xcite relaxed the constraint on translation invariance and mapped a 2d color code to three surface codes . in this paper , we propose an alternate map based on linear algebra .",
    "we map arbitrary color codes , including those that are not translationally invariant , onto two copies of a surface code .    the main differences between the proposed map ( and its variations ) and that of @xcite are : first , the map therein requires local translation symmetry .",
    "second , in the map in @xcite , the number of toric codes onto which the color code is mapped need not always be two . on the other hand , our map always gives exactly two surface codes .",
    "these surface codes need not be copies of the toric code on the square lattice .",
    "third , the proposed map does not require any ancilla qubits , as may be the case for some codes under the map in @xcite . even for arbitrary color codes ,",
    "our map is efficiently computable locally and we compute the images for all the single qubit errors on the color code in closed form . on the other hand ,",
    "the results in @xcite go beyond color codes and include all local translationally invariant 2d stabilizer codes and certain subsystem codes .",
    "our work differs from that of @xcite in the following aspects .",
    "the map in @xcite projects onto three copies of surface codes .",
    "therefore , our map leads to a lower decoding complexity compared to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unlike our map which is a bijective map onto the surface codes , the map in @xcite is not bijective , although it is injective .",
    "this has a bearing in the context of decoding . in some cases ,",
    "a decoder using the map in @xcite may not be able to lift an error ( estimate ) from surface codes to ( the parent ) color code .",
    "this will not occur with a decoder using our map .",
    "following the submission of our paper , we became aware of the work by kubica , yoshida , and pastawski @xcite who showed equivalence between color codes and toric codes for all dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "in 2d , for color codes without boundaries , their result is similar to ours but there are substantial differences .",
    "first , they map the color code onto two _ different _ surface codes , we map onto two copies of the _ same _ surface code .",
    "second , we use linear algebra to study these equivalences , which is simpler than the approach taken in @xcite ( or @xcite ) .    one immediate application of our results , as in @xcite , is an alternate decoding scheme for color codes via surface codes .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with stabilizer codes @xcite and topological codes @xcite .",
    "the pauli group on @xmath1 qubits is denoted @xmath2 .",
    "we denote the vertices of a graph @xmath3 by @xmath4 , and the edges by @xmath5 .",
    "the set of edges incident on a vertex @xmath6 is denoted as @xmath7 and the edges in the boundary of a face by @xmath8 . assuming that @xmath3 is embedded on a suitable surface we use @xmath9 to denote the faces of the embedding and",
    "do not always make explicit reference to the surface .",
    "a surface code on a graph @xmath3 is a stabilizer code where the qubits are placed on the edges of @xmath3 and whose stabilizer @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the pauli group on the qubits of a surface code is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "a 2-colex is a trivalent , 3-face - colorable complex .",
    "a stabilizer code is defined on a 2-colex by attaching qubits to every vertex and defining the stabilizer @xmath10 as @xmath14 we denote the pauli group on these qubits as @xmath15 ; the @xmath16-colored faces of @xmath3 by @xmath17 and the @xmath16-colored edges of @xmath3 by @xmath18 .",
    "we restrict our attention to 2-colexes which do not have boundaries or multiple edges ( the surface codes could contain multiple edges though ) .",
    "this is not a severe restriction because a 2-colex with multiple edges can be modified to another 2-colex without such edges but encoding the same number of qubits and possessing the same error correcting capabilities ( in terms of distance ) .",
    "all embeddings are assumed to be 2-cell embeddings i.e. faces are homeomorphic to unit discs .",
    "there are four types of topological charges on a surface code : i ) electric charge ( denoted @xmath19 ) localized on the vertices , ii ) magnetic charge ( denoted @xmath20 ) living on the plaquettes , iii ) the composite electric and magnetic charge denoted @xmath21 which resides on both the plaquettes and vertices , and iv ) the vacuum denoted @xmath22 . of these ,",
    "only two charges are independent .",
    "we shall take this pair to be the electric and magnetic charges . a charge composed with another charge of the same type",
    "gives the vacuum i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "the electric charges are created by @xmath24-type errors and magnetic charges by @xmath25-type errors on the surface code .    on a color code ,",
    "the topological charges live on the faces .",
    "in addition to being electric and/or magnetic , they also carry a color depending on which face they are present .",
    "let us denote the electric charge on a @xmath16-colored face as @xmath26 , the magnetic charge as @xmath27 and the composite charge as @xmath28 .",
    "the electric charges are not all independent @xcite .",
    "any pair ( two out of three colors ) of them can be taken as the independent set of electric charges . similarly , only two magnetic charges are independent . as for surface codes ,",
    "electric ( magnetic ) charges are created by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) errors on the color code .",
    "a hopping operator is any element of the pauli group that moves the charges . on a surface code",
    ", we can move the electric charges from one vertex to another by means of a @xmath24-type pauli operator .",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the operator that moves @xmath19 from vertex @xmath30 to @xmath6 and vice versa .",
    "if we consider the magnetic charges , then the movement can be accomplished by means of an @xmath25-type pauli operator .",
    "the operator that moves a magnetic charge from face @xmath31 to @xmath32 ( or vice versa ) is denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "elementary hopping operators are those which move charges from one vertex to an adjacent vertex or from one plaquette to an adjacent plaquette .",
    "let @xmath34 be the edge incident on the vertices @xmath30 , @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the elementary hopping operator along @xmath35 as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "it is a specific realization of @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , the elementary operator that moves @xmath38 across @xmath35 is denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the edge shared by the faces @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then @xmath33 can be realized by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "observe that @xmath29 and @xmath33 anti - commute when they act along the same edge , while operators for the same type of charges commute .",
    "in general , @xmath29 and @xmath33 commute if and only if they cross an even number of times .",
    "similarly , we can define hopping operators for color codes .",
    "let @xmath42 be two plaquettes connected by an edge @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the operators that move @xmath26 and @xmath27 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "a realization of these operators along @xmath43 is @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "an element of the stabilizer can be viewed as a combination of hopping operators which move a charge around and bring it back to the original location . since this movement can not be detected , we can always adjoin an element of the stabilizer to the hopping operators .",
    "our goal is to find a map between a color code and some related surface codes .",
    "we shall denote this map by @xmath50 for the rest of the paper .",
    "we shall first describe the construction of @xmath50 in an informal fashion , emphasizing the principles underlying the map , and then rigorously justify all the steps .",
    "the key observation , due to @xcite , is that there are four types of charges on a surface code and sixteen types of charges on a color code .",
    "this is the starting point for relating the color code to surface codes .",
    "the two pairs of independent charges on the color code i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 suggest that we can decompose the color code into a pair of toric codes by mapping @xmath51 charges onto one toric code and @xmath52 onto another .",
    "however , charge `` conservation '' is not the only constraint .",
    "we would like a map that preserves in some sense the structure of the color code and allows us to go back and forth between the color code and the surface codes .",
    "we shall impose some conditions on this map keeping in mind that we would like to use it in the context of decoding color codes .",
    "first , observe that the electric charges on the surface codes live on the vertices while the magnetic charges live on the plaquettes .",
    "but , if we consider the pair of charges @xmath51 , they both live on plaquettes ",
    "one on the @xmath16-colored plaquettes and another on @xmath53-colored plaquettes .",
    "a natural way to make the association to a surface code is to contract all the @xmath16-colored plaquettes in the embedding of @xmath3",
    ". this will give rise to a new graph @xmath54 .",
    "we can now place the charges @xmath26 and @xmath55 on the vertices and plaquettes of @xmath54 respectively .",
    "similarly , the charges @xmath56 can live on the vertices and plaquettes of _ another _ instance of @xmath54 .",
    "we impose the following ( desirable ) constraints on the map @xmath50",
    ". it must be ( i ) linear , ( ii ) invertible , ( iii ) local , ( iv ) efficiently computable , ( v ) preserve the commutation relations between the ( pauli ) error operators on @xmath4 i.e. @xmath15 , and ( vi ) consistent in the description of the movement of charges on the color code and surface codes .",
    "these constraints are not necessarily independent and in no particular order .",
    "it is possible to relax some of the constraints above .",
    "the maps proposed in @xcite are based on the following ideas : i ) conservation of topological charges ii ) identification of the hopping operators and iii ) preserving the commutation relations between the hopping operators .",
    "these ideas are central to our work as well .",
    "however , we take a simpler linear algebraic approach to find the map .",
    "suppose we have a 2-colex @xmath3 .",
    "then , upon contracting all the @xmath16-colored faces including their boundary edges , we obtain another complex .",
    "we denote this operation as @xmath57 and the resulting complex as @xmath58 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tau ] ) .",
    "we suppress the subscript if the context makes it clear and just write @xmath59 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath16-colored faces of @xmath3 and the vertices of @xmath60 , so we can label the vertices of @xmath60 by @xmath61 .",
    "we also label them by @xmath62 to indicate that the vertex was obtained by contracting @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , the edges of @xmath60 are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath16-colored edges of @xmath3 , so an edge @xmath60 is labeled the same as the parent edge @xmath34 in @xmath3 .",
    "the faces which are not in @xmath17 are mapped to faces of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we label the faces as @xmath31 or more explicitly as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the complex @xmath60 has the vertex set @xmath17 , edge set @xmath18 and faces @xmath64 . since every vertex @xmath6 in @xmath3 has a unique @xmath16-colored edge incident on it , we can associate to it an edge in @xmath60 as @xmath65 .    now , each @xmath16-colored face in @xmath3 can host @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "with respect to @xmath54 , they both reside on the vertices of @xmath66 .",
    "so we shall place them on two different copies of @xmath67 ) denoted @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then , the charges @xmath26 and @xmath27 will play the role of an electric charge on @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "so , we shall make the identification @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the associated magnetic charges on @xmath72 will have to reside on @xmath73 .",
    "possible candidates for these charges must come from @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath55 , @xmath76 .",
    "the following lemma addresses these choices .",
    "[ lm : charge - pairing ] let @xmath77 be three distinct colors .",
    "then , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are permissible pairings of the charges so that the color code on @xmath3 can be mapped to a pair of surface codes on @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the electric and magnetic charges of the surface code on @xmath72 .    first , observe that operators that move the electric charges @xmath26 and @xmath74 are both @xmath24-type , therefore they will always commute .",
    "this means that if @xmath26 is identified with the electric charge on a surface code , @xmath74 can not be the associated magnetic charge . that leaves either @xmath87 and @xmath55 .",
    "of these , observe that any operator that moves @xmath87 will always overlap with any operator that moves @xmath26 an even number of times .",
    "therefore , this leaves only @xmath55 .",
    "the operators that move @xmath26 and @xmath55 commute / anti - commute when they overlap an even / odd number of times just as the electric and magnetic charges of a surface code justifying the association @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "a similar argument shows the validity of the equivalence @xmath83 and @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath3 have @xmath1 vertices and @xmath89 vertices of color @xmath16 .",
    "then , @xmath72 has @xmath89 vertices , @xmath90 edges and @xmath91 faces .",
    "together @xmath68 and @xmath69 have @xmath1 qubits .",
    "we desire that @xmath50 accurately reflect the movement of the independent charges on the color code and the surface codes .",
    "so , @xmath50 must map the hopping operators of the charges of the color code on @xmath3 to the hopping operators of the surface code on @xmath72 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , @xmath92 moves electric charges on @xmath16-colored plaquettes and @xmath93 electric charges on @xmath53-colored plaquettes .",
    "but , although these charges may appear to be independent , due to the structure of the color code they are not . a @xmath94-colored plaquette on the color code is bounded by edges whose color alternates between @xmath16 and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath24-type stabilizer associated to this plaquette , i.e. @xmath95 , can be viewed as being composed of @xmath92 hopping operators that move @xmath26 , in which case we would expect to map @xmath95 onto @xmath68 .",
    "but , @xmath95 can also be viewed as being composed of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we see that there are two possible combinations of hopping operators that give the same plaquette stabilizer ; one composed entirely of hopping operators of @xmath16-colored charges and the other of hopping operators of @xmath53-colored charges .",
    "this suggests that there are dependencies among the hopping operators and some of them , while ostensibly acting on only one kind of charge , could still be moving the other type of charges .",
    "however , the overall effect on the other charge must be trivial , i.e. it must move the charge back to where it started . a similar argument can be made for @xmath97 which moves the magnetic charges .",
    "the next lemma makes precise these dependencies .",
    "[ lm : dep - ops ] let @xmath98 and @xmath99 be the vertices in its boundary so that @xmath100 , @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 . if @xmath50 is invertible , then @xmath104 and there are @xmath105 independent elementary hopping operators along the edges of @xmath31 .    the stabilizer generator @xmath95 is given as @xmath106 we see that @xmath95 can be expressed as the product of @xmath107 hopping operators of type @xmath92 or type @xmath93 .",
    "further , we have @xmath108    if @xmath109 , then @xmath110 which means that @xmath111 is not invertible and it would not be possible to preserve the information about the syndromes , as @xmath112 would commute with all the error operators .",
    "so , we require that @xmath113 .",
    "this means that only one of these hopping operators is dependent and there are @xmath114 independent hopping operators .",
    "the linear independence of the remaining @xmath114 operators can be easily verified by considering their support .",
    "similarly , @xmath97 also implies that there are another @xmath114 independent hopping operators , giving us @xmath105 in total .",
    "we are now ready to define the action of @xmath50 on elementary hopping operators . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume if @xmath115 has @xmath116 edges , then the dependent hopping operators of @xmath31 are @xmath117 and @xmath118 i.e. @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
