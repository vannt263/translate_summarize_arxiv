    "thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been attracted a lot of attention during the last three decades .",
    "many interesting physical phenomena are related to it , such as the equation of state of quark gluon plasma(qgp ) , chiral symmetry breaking and restoration , deconfinement phase transition , and so on .",
    "thus , the study of the qcd thermodynamics becomes a basic problem in our understanding of the strong interaction .",
    "particularly , the deconfined qgp is expected to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions(hic ) @xcite and many experiments like those at the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have been built to explore the nature of the qgp and to search for the critical point of the phase transition , which enables many theoretical ideas testable and makes the research area more exciting .    in this paper , we are going to study the thermodynamic properties of the effective chiral dynamical model(cdm)@xcite of low energy qcd with spontaneous symmetry breaking via the dynamically generated effective composite higgs potential of meson fields .",
    "the main assumption in such an effective cdm was based on an effective lagrangian of chiral quarks with effective nonlinear - realized meson fields as the bosonized auxiliary fields , which may be resulted from the nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) four quark interaction@xcite due to the strong interactions of nonperturbative qcd at the low energy scale , then after considering the quantum loop contributions of quark fields by integrating over the quark fields with the loop regularization ( lore ) method@xcite , the resulting effective chiral lagrangian for the meson fields in the cdm@xcite has been turned out to provide a dynamically generated spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism for the @xmath4 chiral symmetry . the key point for deriving the dynamically generated spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism",
    "is the use of the lore method which keeps the physically meaningful finite quadratic term and meanwhile preserves the symmetries of original theory .",
    "more specifically , the advantage of the lore method is the introduction of two intrinsic energy scales without spoiling the basic symmetries of original theory , such intrinsic energy scales play the role of the characteristic energy scale @xmath5 and the sliding energy scale @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the characterizing energy scale of nonperturbative qcd below which the effective quantum field theory becomes meaningful to describe the low energy dynamics of qcd , and @xmath6 reflects the low energy scale of qcd on which the interesting physics processes are concerned . as a consequence",
    ", it was shown that the resulting effective cdm of low energy qcd can lead to the consistent predictions for the light quark masses , quark condensate , pseudoscalar meson masses and the lowest nonet scalar meson masses as well as their mixing at the leading order@xcite .",
    "based on the success of the effective cdm at zero temperature , we will show in this paper how the cdm can be extended to an effective chiral thermodynamic model ( ctdm ) at finite temperature by applying the closed - time - path green function(ctpgf ) approach@xcite , and how the ctdm enables us to describe the critical behavior of the low energy dynamics of qcd , and in particular to determine the critical temperature of the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration .",
    "this comes to our main motivation in the present paper . for our present purpose",
    ", we will investigate the ctdm with considering only two flavors and ignoring the possible instanton effect which is known to account for the the anomalous @xmath7 symmetry breaking .",
    "following the almost same procedure in deriving the cdm for the composite meson fields , we will arrive at an effective ctdm at finite temperature by adopting the ctpgf formalism .",
    "the key step in the derivation is the replacement of the zero - temperature propagator for the quark field with its finite temperature counterpart in the ctpgf formalism which has been shown to be more suitable for characterizing the nonequilibrium statistical processes@xcite .",
    "we then obtain the dynamically generated effective composite higgs potential at finite temperature , its minimal condition leads to the gap equation at finite temperature and enables us to explore the critical behavior and temperature for the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration .",
    "after fixing the free parameters in the effective lagrangian , we present our numerical predictions for the temperature dependence of physically interesting quantities , such as the vacuum expectation value @xmath0 , the pion decay constant @xmath2 , and the masses of pseudoscalar and scalar mesons .",
    "the resulting critical temperature is found to be @xmath8 mev , which is consistent with the njl model prediction@xcite .",
    "before exploring the thermodynamic behavior of the chiral dynamical model , it is useful to have a brief review on its derivation of the effective chiral lagrangian at zero - temperature . for our present purpose with paying attention to the investigation of the chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature , we shall consider the simple case with only two flavors of light quarks @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and ignore the instanton effects .",
    "for simplicity , we also assume the exact isospin symmetry for two light quarks @xmath11 by taking the equal mass @xmath12 .",
    "our discussion here is mainly following the previous paper by dai and wu@xcite .",
    "let us begin with the qcd langrangian for two light quarks @xmath13 where @xmath11 denotes the su(2 ) doublet of two light quarks and the summation over color degrees of freedom is understood .",
    "@xmath14 are the gluon fields with su(3 ) gauge symmetry and @xmath15 is the running coupling constant .",
    "@xmath16 is the light quark mass matrix @xmath17 . in the limit @xmath18 ( @xmath19 )",
    ", the lagrangian has the global @xmath20 chiral symmetry . due to the instanton effect , the chiral symmetry @xmath21 is broken down to the diagonal @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "this instanton effect can be expressed by the effective interaction@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the constant containing the factor @xmath25 .",
    "obviously , such an instanton term breaks the @xmath7 chiral symmetry . as our present consideration",
    "is paid to the phenomenon of the @xmath26 chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite temperature , we will switch off the instanton effect by simply setting @xmath27 in the following discussions .",
    "the basic assumption of the cdm is that at the chiral symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath28 ) the effective lagrangian contains not only the quark fields but also the effective meson fields describing bound states of strong interactions of gluons and quarks . after integrating over the gluon fields at high energy scales , the effective lagrangian at low energy scale",
    "is expected to have the following general form when keeping only the lowest order nontrivial terms : @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\mu_m^2 tr(\\phi m^\\dagger+m\\phi^\\dagger)-\\mu^2_f tr \\phi\\phi^\\dagger\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are the effective meson fields which basically correspond to the composite operators @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are introduced as the external source fields",
    ". it is noticed in eq.([lag1 ] ) that the effective meson fields @xmath30 are the auxiliary fields in the sense that there is no kinetic term for them , which may explicitly be seen by integrating out @xmath30 , we then obtain the following effective lagrangian of quarks : @xmath34 which arrives exactly at the nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) model@xcite of effective four - quark interaction with the quark mass matrix @xmath35 .",
    "when the mass term is understood as the well - defined current quark mass term in the qcd lagrangian eq.([qcd ] ) , it is then clear that @xmath36 .",
    "note that the high order terms with the dimension above two for the effective meson fields are not included , which are assumed to be small and generated in loop diagrams , so only the lowest order nontrivial fermionic interaction terms are taken into account after integrating over the gluon field .    for our present purpose ,",
    "we only focus on the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons while the vector and axial vector sectors will not be considered here . as the pseudoscalar mesons are known to be the would - be goldstone bosons , the effective chiral field theory is naturally to be realized as a nonlinear model .",
    "thus we may express the effective meson fields @xmath37 into the following @xmath38 complex matrix form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) with @xmath42=if^{abc}t^c$ ] and @xmath43 are the four generators of @xmath44 group .",
    "the fields @xmath45 represent the pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath46 the corresponding scalar chiral partners . where @xmath47 is known as the decay constant with mass dimension .    the lagrangian eq.([lag1 ] ) with the definition of composite meson fields @xmath48 eq.([meson_def ] )",
    "is our starting point for the derivation of the effective chiral lagrangian for mesons .",
    "the lagrangian can be obtained by integrating over the quark fields and the procedure for the derivation can be formally expressed in terms of the generating functionals via the following relations @xmath49 [ d q ] [ \\bar{q } ] e^{i\\int d^4x { \\cal l}_{qcd } } &   = & \\frac{1}{\\bar z } \\int [ d\\phi ] [ d q ] [ d\\bar{q } ] e^{i\\int d^4x { \\cal l}_{eff}(q,{\\bar q},\\phi ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{z_{eff } } \\int[d\\phi ] e^{i\\int d^4x { \\cal l}_{eff}(\\phi)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us first demonstrate the derivation of @xmath50 .",

    "however , at high temperature , the environment has a non - negligible density of matter which makes the assumption of zero - temperature field theories inapplicable .",

    ", we will briefly outline the main method with the schwinger - keldysh propagators and the universal feynman rules for the general theory .",
    "let us begin by the general discussion of statistical physics .",
    "a dynamical system can be characterized by its hamiltonian @xmath224 and a statistical ensemble of this system in equilibrium at a finite temperature @xmath225 ( in units of boltzmann constant ) is described in terms of a partition function @xmath226 here @xmath227 is known as the density matrix operator and @xmath228 can be thought of as the generalized hamiltonian of the system .",
    "for example , for a canonical ensemble in which the system can only exchange energy with the heat bath , @xmath228 is defined as : @xmath229 while for a grand canonical ensemble in which the system can not only exchange energy with the heat bath but also exchange particles with the reservoir , @xmath230 is taken as @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the chemical potential and @xmath233 represents the particle number operator .",
    "a observable in a statistical ensemble is the ensemble average for any operator @xmath234 since the partition function and ensemble averages involve a trace operation , this feature leads to the famous kms ( kubo - martin - schwinger ) relation .",
    "@xmath235 note that kms relation only rely on the trace operation and does not depend on any periodicity property of operators along the temperature ( imaginary time ) interval .",
    "now it is easily seen that the operator @xmath236 in the definition of the partition function is very similar to the time evolution operator in the imaginary time axis @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "we promote this similarity and analytically extend the time variable to the complex plane .",
    "so the operator @xmath236 would live on the line interval which is parallel to the negative imaginary time - axis , with its length @xmath238 .",
    "the analogy implies that we can define our theory on some certain contour on the complex t - plane .",
    "the contour should satisfy the following several requirement : ( i ) the two endpoints of the contour must be fixed in an interval in a line parallel to the imaginary axis with its length @xmath238 .",
    "the stating point a ( corresponding to time @xmath239 ) and the ending point b(corresponding to @xmath240 ) are identified , and one requires that @xmath241 if @xmath242 is bosonic and and @xmath243 if @xmath244 is fermionic ; ( ii ) for a system whose spectrum of the hamiltonian is semi - positive ( at least bounded below due to the stability of the system ) , the contour needs to have a monotonically decreasing or constant imaginary part for the reason of the convergence of the complete partition function.the same result can also be obtained by analyzing the convergence of the two - point green function.@xcite ; ( iii ) the contour needs to pass the whole real axis of t - plane on which the field operators @xmath245 are defined ( real - time formalism . otherwise , like the imaginary time formalism , the field operators need to be analytically extended to the imaginary axis first ) .",

    "thus , the first two lines of terms in eq.([chef5 ] ) can be written in a form with respect to @xmath338 : @xmath339\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}l_0[\\xi_l^\\dagger(d_e\\hat{\\phi}\\cdot d_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger)\\xi_l + \\xi_l(d_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\cdot d_e\\hat{\\phi})\\xi_l^\\dagger \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\xi_l^\\dagger(\\hat{\\phi } \\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)^2\\xi_l + \\xi_l(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger \\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{m}^2)^2\\xi_l^\\dagger]\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{n_c}{2}\\int d^4 x_e \\text{tr}_f \\{m_c^2 [ ( \\xi_l l_2\\xi^\\dagger_l)(\\hat{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2 ) + ( \\xi_l^\\dagger l_2\\xi_l)(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{m}^2)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\{(\\xi_ll_0\\xi_l^\\dagger)[d_e\\hat{\\phi}\\cdot d_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger+(\\hat{\\phi } \\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)^2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( \\xi_l^\\dagger l_0\\xi_l)[d_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\cdot d_e\\hat{\\phi}+(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger \\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{m}^2)^2]\\}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general the matrices @xmath327 and @xmath324 ( @xmath325 ) do not commute with each other when different flavors do not have the same current masses .",
    "so the part of effective chiral lagrangian shown in eq.([chef6 ] ) is in general not equivalent to eq.([lag_meson ] ) by just comparing to the same truncated terms .",
    "in fact , by taking into account the higher - order terms in eq.([lag5 ] ) and the last four lines of terms in eq.([chef5 ] ) , it is expected that the extra terms would cancel the unwanted terms in eq.([chef6 ] ) due to non - commutativity of @xmath327 and @xmath324 ( @xmath325 ) . in our present case ,",
    "as we only consider two flavors with the same current quark mass , @xmath327 can commute with @xmath324 and @xmath325 , there is no such extra terms .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned before , the last four lines of terms in eq.([chef5 ] ) will vanish due to commutativity of @xmath327 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following effective chiral lagrangian : @xmath340\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2 } l_0 [ d_e\\hat{\\phi}\\cdot d_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger+ d_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\cdot d_e\\hat{\\phi}+ ( \\hat{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)^2+(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{m}^2)^2]\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is exactly agree with eq.([lag_meson ] ) obtained in the original unrotated basis .    following the procedure in sec.[title ]",
    ", we can derive the effective chiral lagrangian at finite temperature in the chiral thermodynamic model ( ctdm ) , which is : @xmath341\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2 } l_0(t ) [ d^\\prime_e\\hat{\\phi}\\cdot d^\\prime_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger+ d^\\prime_e\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\cdot d^\\prime_e\\hat{\\phi}+ ( \\hat{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger)^2+(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m})^2]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + m_c^2l_2(t)[(\\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)+(\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m}-\\bar{m}^2)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}l_0(t)[(\\hat{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger)(\\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)+(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m})(\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m}-\\bar{m}^2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( \\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)(\\hat{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger-\\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger)+(\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m}-\\bar{m}^2)(\\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger\\hat{\\phi}-\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m})\\nonumber\\\\ & & ( \\bar{\\cal m}\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger-\\bar{m}^2)^2+(\\bar{\\cal m}^\\dagger\\bar{\\cal m}-\\bar{m}^2)^2]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by using the same argument as the one for the zero - temperature chiral dynamical model ( cdm ) analyzed in the text , we can prove the equivalence between eq.([chef7 ] ) and eq.([chef8 ] ) .",
    "thus , based on the equivalent lagrangians , the resulting physics , especially the spectrum of mesons , will not be changed .",
