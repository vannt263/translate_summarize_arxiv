    "the theoretical difficulty in understanding the smallness of the fermi scale in the standard model ( sm ) with respect to any new physics at very high energies is the main motivation for expecting new phenomena to show up already in the energy range that is probed by the cern lhc .",
    "one of the most appealing solutions to this ` hierarchy problem ' is supersymmetry ( susy ) , to the point that it is sometimes called ` the standard way beyond the sm ' .",
    "since superpartners have not been found at colliders , supersymmetry is apparently pushed more and more to higher energies and this in principle weakens its power in solving the hierarchy problem , or equivalently some amount of finetuning is apparently reintroduced in the determination of the electroweak scale . while this is more and more unavoidably true at least for its minimal implementation , the minimal supersimmetric standard model ( mssm ) , it is also clear that non - minimal implementations or non - standard configurations can still have the chance to be natural , i.e. not finely - tuned .",
    "it is then crucial , from a conceptual point of view , to keep an eye on these natural configurations until they are excluded since , if it were not for the hierarchy problem , susy could manifest itself at much higher energies . ] .",
    "the main recent experimental inputs that are relevent for our considerations are the following :    * a sm - like higgs boson is now excluded from about 127 gev up to 600 gev @xcite@xcite . at the same time , there is a @xmath1 hint for a higgs - like scalar close to 125 gev . * direct searches of s - particles",
    "@xcite-@xcite have already set very strong lower bounds on their masses .",
    "these bounds are quite model dependent , however it can be said that typically the squarks of the first two generations have to be heavier than about 1 tev .",
    "the case in which only the third generation is light , which is very motivated by naturalness as we shall see , is instead much less constrained , see @xcite@xcite for theoretical estimates . in such a situation",
    "the gluino could still be as light as @xmath2 gev , with the third generation even down to @xmath3 gev , and the lhc phenomenology depends crucially on the mass difference between the gluino and the charginos / neutralinos ( see figure [ fig : gluinodecays ] ) . *",
    "lhcb @xcite , and later cdf @xcite , have measured with a high precision the direct cp violation in the decays of a @xmath4 meson into @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the world average now yields : @xmath7 which deviates by approximately 3.8@xmath8 from the no - cp violation point , and is quite larger than the value @xmath9 that one would expect in the sm .",
    "we focus on naturalness considerations in section [ sect : nat ] , we consider other possible issues and points of view in section [ sect : other ] , and then conclude in section [ sect : concl ] .",
    "the main purpose of this discussion is to conceptually clarify the various possibilities in a compact way , while providing a relatively rich list of references with particular attention to the most recent studies .",
    "we hope that this summary may be useful at least as an orientation in this subject that is now a very hot topic @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "as already said naturalness , or the problem of finetuning , is the main theoretical motivation for physics beyond the sm at the lhc energies .",
    "it makes thus sense to discuss this point in some detail .",
    "it is usually said that the problem stems from the ` quardatic divergences ' that are present in the radiative corrections to the mass of an elementary scalar , or from the fact that these corrections are quadratically sensitive to the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory .",
    "this statement may sound strange , because it seems to depend on the way the theory is regularized : for example , where is the problem if one uses dimensional regularization instead of a sharp momentum cutoff to make the loop integrals finite ? given the importance of the issue ,",
    "let us briefly see how it can be expressed in terms of renormalized quantities : this will give us more insight in the meaning of finetuning in the supersymmetric case .",
    "consider a heavy fermion field @xmath10 coupled to the higgs boson @xmath11 through a yukawa interaction : @xmath12 and let us regularize the higgs self energy @xmath13 with a cutoff @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant diagram is shown in figure [ figura : loops ] left , and we have : @xmath15\\right|_{p^2=0}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the momentum of the @xmath11 line and ` @xmath18 ' are finite terms .",
    "let us now consider a process involving energy scales @xmath19 much higher than the value @xmath20 of the mass of the higgs particle when it is produced on shell ( the ` pole mass ' , that corresponds to the pole of the propagator ) .",
    "if we do renormalized perturbation theory using @xmath20 , then quantum effects will give in general significant corrections to the physical observables , and it will be necessary to compute the relevant amplitudes at many orders in perturbation theory .",
    "it is instead convenient to treat @xmath21 as a parameter of perturbation theory , defined by a renormalization prescription at the scale @xmath19 , for example : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the renormalized propagator of the scalar @xmath11 .",
    "as a result @xmath21 becomes an ` effective mass ' and starts running with the energy scale @xmath19 according to the renormalization group ( rg ) flow , like the other parameters of perturbation theory , with initial condition : @xmath24 in this way the most important quantum corrections are resummed provided that one uses the value of this ` running mass ' @xmath25 to compute the mass effects in a process involving the typical momentum scale @xmath19 . in words , @xmath25 is ` the mass that minimizes the quantum corrections if we probe the theory at the energy scale @xmath19 ' .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     to summarize , natural supersymmetry with stops and left - handed sbottom well below the tev and heavier first two generations stands now as the only ` conventional ' left out possibility for supersymmetry to solve the hierarchy problem with @xmath26 , or equivalently 10% finetuning ( other ` less conventional ' possibilities are discussed in section [ sect : escaping ] ) .",
    "our considerations are briefly summarized in table [ table : naturalsusy ] .",
    "the main point , as already said , is that the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : natspectrum ] has now the right to be called ` natural supersymmetry ' .",
    "moreover , if the hint for a higgs boson at 125 gev is confirmed , @xmath27susy with singlet - doublet mixing stands as the most natural possibility .",
    "notice also that , due to the large increase in the higgs quartic , in @xmath27susy all the squarks are naturally allowed to be heavier by a factor of 2 or 3 ( see also figure [ naturalness12gen ] ) .",
    "thus , for example , if in the future no stops are found below 1 tev and/or the squarks of the first two generations are excluded up to about 5 tev , then only @xmath27susy - like configurations will have the right to be called ` natural supersymmetry ' ... in this last case , the easiest way to exclude natural supersymmetry might be to exclude the extended higgs sector",
    ". we will come back on these issues in the conclusions .    as a final remark we quote that , maybe also motivated by similar considerations , there has been recent interesting model building activity focussed on susy breaking with split families , or natural supersymmetry as we now say : see e.g. the recent idea of ` flavor mediation ' @xcite @xcite or other possibilities @xcite @xcite-@xcite , including even natural supersymmetry from string theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , since a low @xmath28 can help in minimizing the amount of finetuning in ( [ eq : natbounds ] ) given the sparticle masses , we can also say that low - scale susy breaking is somehow favoured by data(+naturalness ) ; see e.g. @xcite@xcite for very recent studies .",
    "besides taking heavier superpartners , another way to keep supersymmetry alive is escaping the experimental bounds through less - standard or peculiar configurations .",
    "a first well - known possibility is r - parity violation .",
    "recall that , from the superfield point of view , the down - type higgs doublet @xmath29 has exactly the same quantum numbers of the left - handed lepton doublet .",
    "it is thus clear that the baryon number and the lepton number are not accidental symmetries of the theory at the renormalizable level , as instead is the case for the sm .",
    "introducing all the couplings allowed by the gauge symmetry without any suppression mechanism , one ends up with large contributions to excluded processes like proton decay .",
    "the standard way to avoid these terms is to impose by hand an additional discrete symmetry , namely the r - parity , whose quantum number is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the baryon number , @xmath32 is the lepton number , and @xmath33 is the spin of the field @xmath34 and @xmath32 are separately violated by nonperturbative effects at high energies , while @xmath35 is conserved . ] .",
    "notice that all the sm particles have r - parity @xmath36 , while all the superpartners have r - parity @xmath37 .",
    "the most striking consequence of this fact is that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) must be stable , and can thus be a very good dark matter candidate . from the point of view of collider signatures",
    ", r - parity leads to the crucial prediction of abundance of events with missing energy , since the lsp necessarily escapes the detector .",
    "most of the experimental susy - search analyses published so far assume in fact that the production of any supersymmetric particle is accompained by the missing energy carried away by the lsp at the end , eventually , of a decay chain .",
    "for the case of r - parity violating ( rpv ) supersymmetry , on the contrary , very few experimental analyses have been published so far , see e.g. @xcite @xcite , and it is clear that the present stringent bounds on the ` conventional ' r - parity conserving case can be escaped , at least in part . from the conceptual point of view , for rpv to be ` natural ' one needs a rationale to make the effect small enough in order not to be in trouble with proton decay and other very constrained processes . for example a mechanism that one could use , and that is well known to be very efficient in suppressing the flavor violation that additional flavor structures can introduce in beyond - the - sm contexts , is minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) .",
    "the possibility of rpv with mfv has been studied in @xcite@xcite and also recently in @xcite@xcite .",
    "see also @xcite@xcite for recent discussions .",
    "even with conserved r - parity , the signal of jets plus missing energy can be significantly reduced if the mass splittings between some superpartners are small .",
    "for example , a small gluino - lsp splitting reduces the phase space for the gluino dacay : as a consequence the typical missing transverse energy and momentum coming from processes involving gluinos are reduced , leading to a reduced acceptance for given selection cuts . for recent studies of this configuration , called ` compressed spectrum ' , see e.g. @xcite@xcite .    a similar way to reduce the missing energy , that in some cases is even more efficient , is ` stealth susy ' @xcite@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "r - parity is conserved but the lsp of the ordinary sector decays into particles belonging to a ` stealth sector ' in which the relative mass splittings within a supermultiplet are small . moreover , r - parity - even stealth particles can decay back into sm particles ; the phase space is thus again reduced for the decay chain that terminates with the true ` stealth lsp ' .",
    "another example of possible non - standard signatures is given by dirac gauginos , which may distort the phenomenology in a significant way @xcite@xcite@xcite , see also @xcite@xcite@xcite for recent studies",
    ".    in summary , given the negative results of the susy searches so far , trying to see whether the detection may have been escaped for a reason that is not simply large mass is probably being to become a very hot topic in the near future , as an alternative way in which a natural supersymmetry could be realized .",
    "known possibilities are suppressing the missing energy ( rpv ) , suppressing the ` visible energy ' that goes into jets ( compressed spectrum ) , suppressing both ( stealth susy ) , or suppressing the production cross section by giving the gauginos a large dirac mass ( dirac gauginos ) .",
    "new phenomenological studies and ideas about the above issues would probably be very timely .",
    "recall that the main motivations for supersymmetry are , broadly speaking : ( i ) it can solve the hierarchy problem , in a perturbative way ; ( ii ) it gives a good dark matter ( dm ) candidate ; ( iii ) gauge couplings unify at high energy ; ( iv ) it is very elegant and a necessary ingredient of string theory .",
    "moreover all this is done in a way that is almost automatically compatible with the ewpt .    retaining all the features ( i)-(iv )",
    "provides a very attractive picture .",
    "however , that nature must be without finetuning is not a necessity ( we will come back on this in the conclusions ) , and it is meaningful to study what happens retaining ( ii)-(iv ) while abandoning the requirement ( i ) .",
    "it is clear that for dm one needs at least some neutralino at low energy , although its mass may be relatively heavier than the usual susy dm .",
    "it can be seen that the only choice that is radiatively stable is to keep all the gauginos and higgsinos around the tev scale , while the squarks and one higgs scalar doublet can be at a very high mass scale @xmath38 .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that this is also what is required for obtaining a precise gauge coupling unification .",
    "this scanario is called ` split supersymmetry ' @xcite-@xcite , and the only finetuning that is needed is the ( large ) one that makes one of the two scalar doublets much lighter than its natural mass scale , which would be @xmath38 .",
    "split supersymmetry has many interesting peculiar features , whose discussion go beyond our present scopes ; we refer for example to @xcite for a review .",
    "to cite one of them , the gluino can be very non - standard and its dominant dacay width can be into a gluon and a gravitino , giving a single - jet signal with a distinctive energy distribution . alternatively , although it is not the lsp , the gluino can be very long lived if its dominant decay mode is mediated by the heavy squarks , with a variety of possible unusual signatures not only at the lhc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the experimental discovery of a slowly decaying gluino would be a strong indication for split susy , and would also provide a way to measure the high scale @xmath38 .",
    "a more radical point of view is to retain only the motivation ( iv ) and to accept again a large finetuning in the value of the fermi scale .",
    "actually , having accepted the finetuning , string theory is a very plausible framework since it provides a huge number of vacua ( the ` landscape ' ) , and one can speculate about environmental / anthropic selection among them @xcite . in any case , what one ends up with is ` high - scale supersymmetry ' @xcite , in which all the superpartners are relegated at a very high energy and dm is plausibly made of axions .    what can lhc data to - date say about these scenarios",
    "? an interesting feature of both models is that , assuming that there is no additional field content besides the one of the mssm , the value of the higgs mass is very precisely determined in terms of the parameters of the theory , in particular the scale @xmath38 , with some variability depending on the boundary condition at the scale @xmath38 . by carefully performing the running and the various matchings @xcite-@xcite@xcite , it can be seen that a higgs mass of 125 gev implies @xmath39 tev for the case of split susy , while no bound can be derived on @xmath38 in the case of high - scale susy .",
    "finally , these models are practically designed so that the direct bounds on sparticle masses do not touch them , and in particular the second case would not be touched even by eventual strong exclusion bounds on higgsinos and gauginos . if , on the contrary , particles resembling charginos and neutralinos are found , then it will be crucial to measure their couplings with high precision and see whether they are compatible with supersymmetry or not . to do so",
    ", a linear collider would be probably necessary .",
    "so far we have assumed that the hint for a higgs boson at 125 gev stands indeed for a signal , and we discussed some of the consequences for supersymmetric models .",
    "given the importance of the issue , however , it is clear that we can not content ourselves with a @xmath1 evidence , and more data is definitely needed ( as the experimental collaborations also say ) . moreover the fact that the channel in which most of the excess is seen , namely the diphoton one , prefers a rate that is _ larger _ than in the sm is precisely what one would expect in case of a background fluctuation .",
    "let us than say something about the possibility ( that may be disproved quite soon ) that the present excess goes away and a sm - like higgs boson is excluded up to a mass of 500 - 600 gev .",
    "the sm alone would then be excluded by the combination of higgs searches and electroweak precision tests . in the context of supersymmetry",
    ", the most plausible explanation would be that the cp - even scalars of the higgs sector have a reduced production cross section times branching ratio with respect to the sm higgs boson .",
    "namely , what counts is the quantity : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a given final state . in particular , above @xmath42 the higgs boson decay into vector bosons is the dominant channel in the sm .",
    "looking at the exclusion plots we see that a heavy ` not - so - much - sm - like higgs boson ' is still allowed by data provided that @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "this suppression is not difficult to achieve , generally speaking , in supersymmetric models @xcite@xcite , thanks to mixing effecs ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or top - loop effects that modify the gluon - fusion efficiency @xcite , or a depletion of @xmath46 due to a significant decay width into two neutralino lsp . in the case of @xmath27susy , in which such non - sm - like higgs particles above @xmath42",
    "can be achieved very easily , it can be seen that it is not implausible to have @xmath47 for both the cp - even scalars , and it can also happen that the next to lightest state is more easily detectable than the lightest one @xcite-@xcite .    in conclusion , strictly speaking at the moment of writing it is not excluded that the hint for a higgs boson at 125 gev is just a fluctuation of the background . in this case",
    "there may be one or more not - so - much - sm - like higgs bosons with mass between 200 and 300 gev and @xmath48 .",
    "waiting for more data to disprove these possibilities , we can say that if no sm - like higgs boson is found at 125 gev , then in reasonable models we typically expect at least one almost - sm - like such scalar below 500 gev with . ] @xmath49 .",
    "if the lightest scalar , with reduced couplings , is found to be above 200 gev , then in the context of supersymmetry this would be a strong indication for models with largely increased quartic coupling , like @xmath27susy .",
    "on the contrary , if a sm - like higgs boson is indeed found at 125 gev , then eventual additional scalars can have very low @xmath50-values .      as a last issue ,",
    "let us give attention to the possibility that the recently measured direct cp - violation in the @xmath4-meson decays , reported in equation ( [ eq : deltaacp ] ) , is a signal of physics beyond the sm . whether the experimental value can be explained within the sm or not is still under discussion .",
    "what we can say is that it is _ possible _ that the sm accounts for the observed effect @xcite@xcite , but maybe not very easily or at least it is fair to say that _ new physics is not implausible _ ( see e.g. @xcite -@xcite ) .    in the np interpretation ,",
    "what one needs is a rationale to understand why the main effect comes out in a @xmath51 process without disturbing the very tightly - constrained @xmath52 ones . referring to @xcite for details , a way to understand",
    "it in the context of supersymmetric models may be that flavor violation in the squark sector comes mainly from left - right mixings ( i.e. from the a - terms ) , while the left - left and right - right mixings are subleading .",
    "the size of the experimental value can then be naturally explained in the configuration called ` disoriented a - terms ' , in which the size of the entries of the a - term matrices is the same of those of the corresponding yukawa matrices but without respecting exact proportionality .    a concrete realization of this configuration that may actually be considered also independently of supersymmetry can be @xcite to invoke the paradigm of partial compositeness .",
    "in fact , if the flavor structure is originated by this mechanism , than one expects an effective lagrangian of the type : @xmath53 while the yukawa matrices are given by : @xmath54 where the @xmath55 are ` suppression factors ' generated by the strong dynamics .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath56 operators tend to be suppressed more than the @xmath57 ones , and thus we are going in the right direction .",
    "moreover as discussed e.g. in @xcite and @xcite , the best candidates for producing a sizable effect in the charm sector while being consistent with the other flavor constraints are the @xmath58 chromomagnetic operators , such as : @xmath59 together with the other one with opposite chiralities whose effect is typically relatively suppressed by a factor @xmath60 . in the notation ( [ eq : finalparametrization ] ) we have , following @xcite@xcite : @xmath61 where im@xmath62 is the hadronic matrix element of @xmath63 , and we used the fact that @xmath64 is expected to be @xmath65 times the cabibbo angle . since a reasonable estimate can be @xmath66 , in order to be compatible with the observed value ( [ eq : deltaacp ] ) one needs either an enhanced sm contribution @xmath67 , or a np contribution that corresponds in our case to : @xmath68 in a supersymmetric context these flavor - violating operators are generated by the flavor - mixings in the squark mass matrices , that are of the form ( looking at the order of magnitudes , no proportionality between matrices ! ) : @xmath69 moreover the effects come at the loop level , so that ( [ eq : fixingthescale ] ) can translate into : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the typical scale of superpartner masses . notice that until last year this would have been more than welcome , as a possible signal of supersymmetric particles , while now it starts being in tension with the bounds from direct detection !    for a detailed study along this direction",
    "we refer to @xcite , in which this possibility is thoroughly discussed .",
    "it can be seen that the other bounds on flavor - violation in the quark sector are easily satisfied , while the electric dipole moments ( edm ) turn out to be the strongest constraint .",
    "this picture could also be extended to the lepton sector , and in this case the strongest bounds come from @xmath72 and the electon edm .",
    "we discussed the status of a few motivated beyond - the - mssm models in the light of the recent lhc data .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "* insisting on naturalness : natural supersymmetry . *",
    "the present hint of a higgs boson at 125 gev tells us that , in the mssm , the stop should be too heavy to be natural according to the criterion @xmath26 .",
    "this instead is not a problem for non - minimal extensions , and thus we can at least say that beyond - the - mssm models with increased quartic coupling are more motivated than before . apart from that , the most solid input so far is that the first two generations must be above the tev , thus either one tolerates @xmath73 or typically one needs the third generation to be lighter than the first two . for this reason , ` more minimal ' or ` hierarchical ' scenarios",
    "can now be renamed ` natural supersymmetry ' ( since it is the only left natural possibility ... unless point 4 , below ) .",
    "actually in @xmath27susy the stop at about 1 tev , eventually degenerate with the other squarks , can be compatible with @xmath26 . in this case",
    "however also the first two generations can naturally be much heavier .",
    "low scale susy breaking is also favoured in this view , since broadly speaking it reduces the amount of tuning .",
    "+ how to exclude natural supersymmetry ?",
    "a relatively fair statement may be : _ not finding the higgs boson _",
    "( which would actually exclude also most of the finely - tuned susy scenarios ) , _ and/or especially not finding superpartners at the lhc_. 2 .",
    "* escaping the lhc bounds . * r - parity violation after all is not compulsory , and without it the present bounds are partly escaped .",
    "other possibilities can be susy with a compressed spectrum , stealth mechanisms , or dirac gauginos .",
    "it is important to be ready to these distortions of the ` usual ' lhc phenomenology .",
    "+ this is clearly a very hot topic ! in the future ,",
    "if the bounds get stronger , we might be forced to call it something like ` alternative natural supersymmetry ' ... 3 .   * insisting only on dm and unification and/or strings : split and high - scale susy . * by construction",
    ", these possibilities are not touched by direct bounds on squarks .",
    "thus for the moment the only experimental input for these models is the value of the higgs boson mass , from which we can say that split susy has to be ` not - so - split ' ( @xmath39 tev ) , while nothing can be said so far in case of high - scale susy .",
    "* higgs boson not at 125 gev . *",
    "the importance of the issue is such that we can not content ourselves with a @xmath74 evidence : although there are a lot of good reasons for the higgs boson to be there , the significance of the present hint is such that it may well be a background fluctuation .",
    "more importantly , heavier scalars with reduced couplings are present in susy as well as in other motivated extensions of the sm , and they must be looked for .",
    "+ what can be said is that , if the present hint turns out to be a fluctuation , then it is obviously crucial to look for the most - sm - higgs - like particle ( with reduced couplings ) . in this case , it is fair to say that such a particle can not be considered to be reasonably excluded until the exclusion bound at 95% c.l .",
    "is at least down to @xmath75 .",
    "* direct cpv in @xmath4 decays . * in the context of supersymmetry , assuming that the sm contribution is not enough to explain the data , a very natural possibility is to have ` disoriented a - terms ' .",
    "this may be explicitly realized in a context in which the flavor structure has something to do with the mechanism of partial compositeness .",
    "if this is the case , new effects are predicted to be around the corner in the neutron edm and , if the picture is extended to leptons in the most straightforward way , in the electron edm and in @xmath72 .    to conclude , in the near future a very fundamental question has a chance to be answered : _ was naturalness a good guiding principle ?",
    "_ the lhc will tell us .",
    "the very minimal requirement is a colored sector mainly coupled to the top , at or below the tev .",
    "if supersymmetry is the way of nature , this will be the scalar partner of the top .",
    "thus a very important point is whether the stop is there or not .",
    "notice that if this sector is made of scalars the first option would be susy , while in case of fermions the most plausible possibility would be compositeness .    in any case , also being open to the possibility that naturalness is implemented in an unexpected way , at least new particles / resonances within the lhc reach and/or a non - standard higgs boson are requred .",
    "thus , in case the higgs boson is discovered , it will be crucial to measure its couplings and check whether it is sm - like or not , also looking at ww - scattering and looking for a second higgs doublet .",
    "if the higgs particle is discovered to be exactly sm - like and no new particles are found , this will be a _ _ strong indication that there is fundamental finetuning in nature _ _ , we like it or not . on the contrary , a non - standard higgs boson and especially new particles would probably tell us that naturalness arguments were correct . confirming or discarding the naturalness of the fermi scale will be a very nontrivial conceptual input for the scientific though .",
    "thus for the moment it makes sense to keep insisting on natural supersymmetry , until it is found or excluded .",
    "a quite non - conventional alternative is that _ nothing _ is found at the lhc , not even the higgs particle , which is probably what most people expect least .",
    "finally , we must not forget about flavor physics : even in presence of a totally - sm - like higgs boson and no extra particles , non - ckm flavor effects would at least imply that there is some new physics relatively at hand , although maybe beyond the lhc reach for direct discovery .",
