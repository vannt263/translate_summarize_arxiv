    "<S> a thin fiber or sheet curled into a circular container has a detached region whose shape and force ratios are independent of material properties and container radius . </S>",
    "<S> we compute this shape and compare it with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete forces acting at either end of the detached region have a ratio that depends only on the length of the fiber or sheet relative to the circle radius . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate this force ratio in three regimes of circle radius .    </S>",
    "<S> a sheet of office paper coiled into a mailing tube hugs the wall of the tube in order to minimize its bending . </S>",
    "<S> but the contact with the wall is incomplete ; near the edge , the paper detaches or takes off from the wall and rejoins the cylinder only at the edge . </S>",
    "<S> such detachment is a commonplace feature of coiled sheets or fibers small and large . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the detached region has a universal shape that touches down at an angle of 24.1 degrees . moreover , the takeoff point experiences a focused force controlled by the length of the fiber or sheet . to    to explain@xcite this behaviour , we consider a fibre confined in a circular ring of radius @xmath0 ; the same reasoning applies to a sheet confined in a cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the detached region is necessary because the fibre must be uncurved at the touchdown point . to bend the fiber at any point requires an external torque around that point@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the external force @xmath1 at the touchdown point exerts no torque . since the end of the fiber is uncurved </S>",
    "<S> , it must angle inward in order to remain in the ring . </S>",
    "<S> thus a segment of some length @xmath2 must be detached . </S>",
    "<S> the universal properties reported below arise from the mechanical equilibrium of this detached segment .    the fiber curves </S>",
    "<S> so as to minimize its mechanical energy . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the fiber shape by giving its deflection angle @xmath3 from the vertical at a distance @xmath4 from the takeoff point . </S>",
    "<S> this point @xmath5 is at angle @xmath6 to the vertical axis , so that @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( figure 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the end of the fiber , at the bottom of the circle , is at distance @xmath8 from the takeoff point , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the upward touchdown force @xmath1 acts normal to the circle ; thus , frictional forces are not included . </S>",
    "<S> the energy per unit length then consists of the deformation energy , proportional to the square of the curvature @xmath10 , and the work done against @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath11 is thus given by @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the bending stiffness of the fiber@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 that minimizes such an energy must satisfy the euler - lagrange equation@xcite : @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the fiber at the takeoff point has the same angle and curvature as the adjacent fiber lying against the circle . </S>",
    "<S> this determines @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath1 must be chosen to make the end of the fiber lie on the constraining circle . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints uniquely determine the fiber shape@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the detached region subtends an angle @xmath6 that is independent of the nature of the fiber or the size of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> that is , it is independent of the bending stiffness @xmath13 and the confining radius @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , there is no way to combine @xmath13 , which involves energy , with @xmath0 , which does not , in a way that gives a pure number . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the touchdown angle @xmath17 , the relative arc length @xmath18 and the shape of the detached region are independent of @xmath13 and @xmath0 ( figure 1b )    the ring exerts a discrete kickoff force denoted @xmath19 between fiber and ring at the takeoff point . </S>",
    "<S> the tensile counterpart of this force is familiar in de - lamination of multilayer sheets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this kickoff force is needed to balance the touchdown force @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the detached region experiences a tangential pushing force from the remainder of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> however @xmath1 also has a component normal to the takeoff surface , and the ring must supply this normal force . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 ; the fiber functions as a precision force divider .    </S>",
    "<S> short fibers behave differently from the longer fibers discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> a ring with radius @xmath0 can accommodate a fiber of half - length @xmath22 without bending . if r decreases and becomes smaller than s , the fiber bends while continuing to touch the ring at either side . once @xmath0 has decreased to a value @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , the fiber touches the ring at its midpoint . as @xmath0 decreases further , </S>",
    "<S> the fiber is pressed harder against the ring , its curvature radius at the midpoint @xmath24 increases , the kickoff force @xmath19 increases as the touchdown points slide away . </S>",
    "<S> finally @xmath0 reaches a value @xmath25 where the radius @xmath26 has increased to @xmath0 . now </S>",
    "<S> the fiber has begun to lie along the ring . </S>",
    "<S> further decrease in @xmath0 simply expands this contacting region so that the two takeoff points move away from the midpoint of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the two detached regions then take on the long - fiber shape treated above ( figure 1c )    it is easy to confine a straight fiber in a circle of known radius . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry could prove useful for making precisely controlled shapes and forces on the macro- and micro scale . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this force - focusing mechanism to be useful where controlled forces need to be exerted on nanometer - scale objects such as surfactant vesicles or biomolecules </S>",
    "<S> . the forcing fiber can be _ </S>",
    "<S> e. g. _ a carbon nanotube @xcite , a biofilament @xcite , or a wormlike micelle@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the use of different boundary shapes or deformable boundaries add additional control possibilities .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank juliano denardin for providing the metal strip used in the experiments , and sidney nagel and aaron dinner for useful comments . </S>",
