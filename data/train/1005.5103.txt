    "topologically ordered phases are fascinating states of quantum matter characterized by a ground - state degeneracy which depends on the genus of the considered topology @xcite .",
    "they are also known to exhibit exotic elementary excitations , dubbed anyons , which have nontrivial braiding statistics @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest for the study of topologically ordered phases has been triggered by the possibility to use anyons as an essential ingredient either to perform quantum computation or to provide a quantum memory @xcite .",
    "to understand these properties , much focus has been drawn on two - dimensional quantum spin systems especially since kitaev has proposed two exactly solvable models , the toric code @xcite and the honeycomb model @xcite , in which such anyons are present .    in the present work ,",
    "we provide an extension of the kitaev honeycomb model for which many experimental realizations in optical lattices @xcite , josephson junctions arrays @xcite , or solid state systems with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite have been proposed . up to now",
    ", many variations of this model have already been investigated , but almost all of them rely on changing the geometry of the underlying lattice @xcite . here , we choose an alternative route by keeping the honeycomb geometry but by changing the coupling configuration .",
    "doing so , we propose a set of exactly solvable models which , as we will see , can give rise to surprising properties as compared to the original one @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : themodel ] we recall the basic properties of the kitaev honeycomb model and we explain how to extend it by considering different dimer coverings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasediag ] , we focus on three simple coupling patterns for which we compute the ground - state ( vortex - free ) phase diagrams using majorana fermionization and analyze the influence of a three - spin interaction term . the following sec .",
    "[ sec : vortexprop ] is dedicated to sparse vortex configurations .",
    "there , we use a perturbative treatment to show that the nature ( attractive or repulsive ) of vortex - vortex interaction is very sensitive to the dimer configuration .",
    "the kitaev honeycomb model describes a set of spins 1/2 located at the vertices of a hexagonal lattice which interact via the following hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the usual pauli matrices at site @xmath2 . in the original model @xcite , kitaev considered the case where the type of links ( @xmath3 , or @xmath4 ) depends only on its orientation as depicted in fig .",

    "so far , extensions of this model were based on a different lattice geometry @xcite or a different underlying algebra @xcite .",
    "sticking to a spin-1/2 model , the exact solvability is preserved only if the following two constraints are satisfied : @xmath8 each site of the system must be trivalent and @xmath9 the three links connected to a given site have to be of different types ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) can be defined and solved on any trivalent graph .    here ,",
    "by contrast , we study the kitaev model ( [ eq : ham ] ) in the original honeycomb lattice but for different link distributions or dimer coverings ( we shall use the expressions link distributions or dimer coverings as synonyms , so dimer coverings do not have the same meaning here as they have in the context of quantum dimer models ) . more precisely , we focus on the three simple dimer coverings shown in figs .

    "as shown below , the phase diagram strongly depends on the dimer covering and displays very different properties when switching on a three - spin interaction term already introduced by kitaev  @xcite to break the time - reversal symmetry explicitely . such a term is built in the following way : if two dimers @xmath17 of type @xmath18 and @xmath19 of type @xmath20 share a common site @xmath21 , then the three - spin term is defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the direction orthogonal to @xmath18 and @xmath20 .    the hamiltonian considered in the present work",
    "can thus be written as @xmath24 here , we only consider positive couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 . a crucial feature of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamk ] ) is that it commutes with plaquette operators defined , on each plaquette @xmath27 , as @xmath28 where @xmath2 runs over the set of six spins around the plaquette @xmath27 , and where the notation @xmath29 means the `` outgoing '' direction at site @xmath2 , with respect to the plaquette s contour @xcite . since @xmath30 , plaquette operators @xmath31 have eigenvalues @xmath32 . consequently , there is one conserved @xmath33 degree of freedom per plaquette .",
    "following kitaev @xcite , we will say that there is a vortex on a plaquette if @xmath34 and no vortex if @xmath35 .",

    "the three dimer coverings considered here differ by the number and the type of plaquette operators @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , for covering @xmath14 there is only one type of plaquette operator @xmath40 where @xmath41 to @xmath42 are the six spins numbered clockwise around any plaquette @xmath27 , spin number @xmath41 being at the bottom of the plaquette .",
    "covering @xmath43 has two types ( a and b ) of plaquette operators ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : lattice2 ] ) @xmath46 one can readily see that the structure of these operators is similar for coverings @xmath14 and @xmath43 since they contain two pauli matrices of each kind ( @xmath7 and @xmath4 ) whereas , for covering @xmath45 , each plaquette operator is made of identical pauli matrices .",

    "@xcite , the ground state , at least for @xmath47 , lies in the vortex - free sector ( @xmath38=@xmath48 for all @xmath27 ) on which we focus thereafter .",
    "undoubtedly , one of the most remarkable properties of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamk ] ) is that , in each vortex sector , it can be mapped onto a free majorana fermion problem in a static @xmath33 gauge field . as detailed in ref .",
    ", @xmath37 can be written in terms of majorana fermion operators @xmath49 at site @xmath21 , and reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 . in the latter expression , @xmath52 is the coupling on the link @xmath19 and @xmath53 is a gauge field which describes the vortex configuration through the relation @xmath54 where @xmath21 belongs to the black sublattice and @xmath55 to the white one ( see figs .",

    "thus , for a given vortex configuration , one simply has to diagonalize the matrix @xmath57 to get the spectrum of the corresponding sector .",
    "obviously , such a task is easy for periodic configurations but difficult otherwise . in particular ,",
    "when one is interested in sparse vortex configurations , one needs to diagonalize large systems and perform some finite - size analysis ( see sec .  [",

    "one important remark is that , using periodic boundary conditions , vortices can only be created in pairs @xcite .",
    "thus , to compute the one - vortex gap , one has first to consider the two - vortex gap @xmath85 of a pair of vortices on plaquettes @xmath2 and @xmath21 defined by @xmath86 the right - hand side is the energy difference between the ground - state energy @xmath87 of the considered two - vortex sector and @xmath88 which is the ground - state energy of the vortex - free sector .",
    "then we use the fact that , in the abelian phase , vortex excitations are gapped @xcite so that the interaction of two distant vortices decreases exponentially .",
    "this allows us to define the one - vortex gap as @xmath89 where it is essential that both vortices are of the same type , _ i.  e. _ a or b for model @xmath43 , and a or b or c for model @xmath45 , see sec .",

    "[ sec : single_vortices ] ) .      to have a better understanding of these few - vortex properties",
    ", we have also developped an alternative approach .",
    "we computed the spectrum of @xmath37 perturbatively up to high orders using the perturbative continuous unitary transformation ( pcut ) method @xcite around the isolated - dimer limit , where one of the couplings is much larger than the others .",
    "such a strategy has been shown to be very successful in the original kitaev model @xcite although restricted to abelian phases . here",
    ", we proceed along the same line as in ref .   and we skip all technical details which can be found in this reference .     by replacing @xmath4-dimers by effective sites ( filled black circles ) .",
    "the effective lattice for coverings @xmath14 ( left ) and @xmath43 ( middle ) is a  square \" lattice . for covering @xmath45 ( right ) ,",
    "one gets a kagome lattice .",
    "gray - shaded areas show the different types of effective plaquette identified by the same labels as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice2 ] .",
    "red ( green ) bonds denote @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) links . ]    as discussed in refs .",
    ", in the limit @xmath91 it is convenient to analyze the problem by replacing @xmath4-dimers by effective sites with four degrees of freedom corresponding to the four possible dimer states .",
    "then , depending on the dimer configuration , one can face different structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_lattices ] ) .    for covering @xmath14 ,",
    "the effective lattice is a  square \" lattice in which all plaquettes are identical . for covering @xmath43",
    ", one still has a square lattice but one must distinguish between two kinds of plaquettes ( a and b ) which reflect the operator structure ( [ eq : wp_ii ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the effective lattice for covering @xmath45 is a kagome lattice with three different types ( a , b and c ) of plaquettes : one hexagonal plaquette with alternating @xmath10- and @xmath11-links and two triangular plaquettes with either only @xmath10- or only @xmath11-links .",
    "it is worth noting that such an effective lattice was also obtained in ref .  , starting from a different initial geometry .    as already explained , in the abelian phase the kitaev honeycomb model contains two different kinds of excitations : low - energy vortices and high - energy fermions .",
    "the pcut method around the isolated - dimer limit provides ( order by order in @xmath92 and in the thermodynamic limit ) an effective hamiltonian which commutes with the number of fermions .",
    "thus , the low - energy spectrum is obtained by considering the zero - fermion ( quasiparticle ) block usually denoted 0qp . in this model ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the 0qp sector is particularly simple because it can be fully expressed in terms of the conserved @xmath33 plaquette operators @xmath93 .",
    "its general structure reads @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a constant and where @xmath96 denotes a set of @xmath97 plaquettes .",
    "the sum runs over all possible plaquette numbers and configurations . in the present work ,",
    "we have computed the corresponding coefficients @xmath98 of this multi - plaquette expansion up to order 10 .",
    "the ground - state energy of any vortex configuration is then readily obtained by replacing @xmath39 by @xmath99 if there is a vortex and by @xmath48 otherwise .    before presenting the results",
    ", we would like to point out that the validity range of the pcut results does _ not _ depend on the vortex filling .",
    "however , this perturbative treatment is only valid as long as all fermionic gaps are finite .",
    "for instance , this implies that although the gapless phase is reduced to a single point for dimer covering @xmath45 , this perturbative approach breaks down well before this point is reached since some fermionic gaps in other vortex sectors vanish @xcite .",
    "for the three dimer coverings considered here , we are led to conjecture that there always exists a vortex configuration such that the fermionic gap vanishes for @xmath68 . for covering @xmath14 and @xmath43 , this",

    "these findings have been analytically confirmed by perturbative expansions around the isolated - dimer limit inside the abelian phase .    finally , let us point out two routes left for the future .",
    "firstly , it would be interesting to investigate other vortex congurations since , as recently observed in the original kitaev model @xcite , vortex interactions could lead to new topological phases characterized , notably , by exotic chern numbers @xcite .",
    "secondly , it would be worth studying the effect of disordered dimer and/or vortex configurations to see if an anderson - type transition can occur in such systems .",
    "note that other kinds of disorder have recently been considered in refs .  .",
    "we hope that the present work will stimulate further investigations in a near future ."
