    "star clusters have long been important tools for studying stellar evolution , specifically because they play _ the _ pivotal role in determining the ages of stars .",
    "the most commonly used method for measuring the age of an open star cluster involves fitting an isochrone to the cluster s observed color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , specifically to the cluster s main sequence turn off ( msto ) . generating and fitting isochrones to a cluster cmd to determine its age also requires knowledge of the cluster s metallicity , distance , and reddening .",
    "oftentimes , finding a best fit of these three parameters ( plus age ) is a subjective process , as some of these parameters are correlated with each other .",
    "this difficulty is reflected in isochrones that appear to fit the cmd equally well with various combinations of cluster parameters ( see , for example , figure 2 of vandenberg & stetson 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the fit of the msto can be challenging and isochrones may give inconsistent results in different filters , even when using the same cluster parameters ( see , for example , figure 10 of sarajedini et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "an independent method to measure the age of a cluster involves using the cluster white dwarfs ( wds ) . because a wd s luminosity is directly related to its cooling time ( mestel 1952 ; winget et al .",
    "1987 ) , this information , along with wd masses and atmospheric types , provide the wd cooling age and ultimately the cluster age . measuring and comparing the msto age and the wd age of a cluster is currently the best means to test and calibrate both methods and their underlying theory .",
    "we seek a more objective way to fit isochrones to cluster cmds to more precisely determine ages from both the msto and the cluster wds .",
    "high - precision ages will allow for more meaningful comparison and calibrations between the two methods . to this end",
    ", our group has developed and successfully implemented a robust technique that utilizes bayesian statistical methods .",
    "the bayesian method determines the posterior distribution of model parameters , resulting in something akin to a best fit . in this paper , we determine the age and cluster parameters of metallicity , distance , and reddening for four intermediate - age ( @xmath11 gyr ) open clusters : ngc 2360 , ngc 2477 , ngc 2660 , and ngc 3960 .    our motivation in choosing these clusters is primarily related to testing wd models .",
    "clusters in this age range are sensitive to crystallization and phase separation of carbon and oxygen in wds .",
    "our group has obtained deep observations of these clusters with the hubble space telescope , and we will analyze the wd sequences in these clusters in a future companion paper . in this paper",
    "we focus on new photometric ground - based data we have obtained for the purpose of measuring the msto age and improving cluster parameters for these four clusters .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows : we discuss the clusters and the observations in section [ obs ] , including observed cmds for the complete field around each cluster ; in section [ isochrones ] we determine the msto age for each cluster using traditional methods of fitting isochrones , largely by eye ; in section [ bayes ] we describe the bayesian technique and how it is applied to each cluster ( including the necessary prior distributions on several parameters ) ; we discuss the results in section [ results ] ; and we end with concluding remarks in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the four clusters in this study ( ngc 2360 , ngc 2477 , ngc 2660 , and ngc 3960 ) have long histories of prior observations .",
    "we summarize some of the previous determinations of these clusters parameters in tables [ lit2360 ]  [ lit3960 ] . for consistency , values of distance and reddening",
    "are reported in the tables as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , regardless of how they are reported in the original source .",
    "if the original source reported @xmath4 , we converted this to @xmath3 using the relationship    @xmath5    similarly , when a literature source reports unreddened distance modulus @xmath6 , we converted it to the apparent distance modulus using the standard definition :    @xmath7    for this study we obtained new observations of each of these clusters . in this section ,",
    "we describe the observations , data reduction , and the process of obtaining photometry .",
    ".cluster parameters from the literature for ngc 2360 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      one of the advantages of using a disciplined bayesian method is the recovery of posterior distributions that may be asymmetric or even multi - modal .",
    "these types of distributions can lead to an increased understanding in , e.g. , how individual stars can drive the solution . to illustrate this , we explore the bimodal posterior distribution of the age of ngc 3960 ( see the lower right panels of figure [ all_pdfs ] ) .    first , we did a cut of the mcmc result of age to separate the two modes , as we show in figure [ bimodal3960 ] . in this figure , we plot the complete posterior distributions ( from figure [ all_pdfs ] ) in gray , the draws from the left mode with the dotted line and the draws from the right mode with the dashed lines . in the remaining three panels we plot",
    "metallicity , distance , and reddening , and we see that these draws separate from each other , e.g. , also explaining the bimodality of the posterior distribution of distance . based on these distributions , we were able to produce and compare isochrones generated with the means of each distribution and compare their fits .",
    "in the left panel of figure [ cmd2modes ] we overplot these two isochrones on the @xmath8 cmd of ngc 3960 . as before",
    ", the dotted line represents the isochrone produced using mean values from the draws from the left mode of the age distribution , while the dashed line uses mean values for the right mode .",
    "the isochrone fits are very close but a small visible difference can be seen in the red giant branch .",
    "the gray box on the full cmd shows the region that is zoomed in the lower right panel of figure [ cmd2modes ] . in the zoomed cmd ,",
    "the gray stars are those that were consistently rejected as field stars by base-9 .",
    "we investigated the effect of the four labeled stars ( 384 , 487 , 531 , and 695 ) on the solution .",
    "we first re - ran the cluster using base-9 , but this time we remove star 695 completely and set the prior probability of cluster membership of stars 384 , 487 , and 531 to 1.0 .",
    "this forces those stars to be cluster members by not allowing base-9 to consider the possibility that they may be field stars .",
    "we then ran base-9 again , this time setting the prior probability of cluster membership of star 695 to 1.0 and removing stars 384 , 487 , and 531 .",
    "the posterior distributions resulting from these tests are shown in the upper right panel of figure [ cmd2modes ] .",
    "the solid gray line shows the original age distribution for ngc 3960 , with the other distributions overplotted and re - scaled arbitrarily for comparison .",
    "based on these plots , the explanation for the bimodal age distribution is clear .",
    "base-9 identifies two possibilities for stars 384 , 487 , 531 , and 695 : either star 695 is a cluster star and the others are not , or stars 384 , 487 , and 531 are cluster stars and star 695 is not .",
    "the first possibility corresponds to the left mode in the age distribution and the second possibility corresponds to the right mode .",
    "looking at the zoomed cmd ( bottom right panel ) this is not surprising , as these stars straddle the isochrones , corresponding to the left and right modes .",
    "this test demonstrates the power of base-9 in isolating and understanding the role individual stars on the cmd can play , and understanding non - gaussian distributions .",
    "we note that because the peaks of the two modes of the age distribution of ngc 3960 are within one standard deviation of the average of the total distribution ( see table [ results_table ] ) , we retain the estimates and errors we previously reported for this cluster .",
    "in section [ isochrones ] we employed the long - used , eye - based technique of fitting isochrones to cluster cmds to obtain ages , as well as other cluster - wide parameters .",
    "performing a best fit by eye can be difficult , as the effects of some parameters can mimic others in the cmds .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ cmd_iso ] , the fits look good , but at times the crudeness of the technique limits confidence that the fits are optimum .",
    "the by - eye technique is further complicated when photometry in multiple filters is available .",
    "the data used here are photometry in three filters ( @xmath9 ) , meaning we could have three possible cmds for each cluster ( i.e. , @xmath10 vs. @xmath8 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 ; more cmds are possible by also varying the color on the vertical axis ) .",
    "we want to optimize over all of the cmds .",
    "plotted cmds are , in reality , two - dimensional ( 2d ) projections of what is really a higher dimensional diagram ; various structures may not be apparent in these 2d projections .",
    "with base-9 we simultaneously fit isochrones to photometry in @xmath13 available filters , and these challenges disappear .",
    "the specific issue of fitting isochrones to a variety of filter combinations with base-9 has been explored in detail by hills et al .",
    "they found that limitations in stellar models create systematic differences among some filter combinations , and find a general preference for the fits that involve more filters .",
    "the ages we determined using base-9 for ngc 2360 and ngc 2477 are within the uncertainty of the ages found using the by - eye technique ( table [ results_table ] ) . for ngc 2660 and ngc 3960 ,",
    "the ages determined by base-9 are higher and lower ( respectively ) than those found using by - eye isochrone fitting , but fall among values found by previous authors ( tables [ lit2660 ] and [ lit3960 ] ) .",
    "reasons for this discrepancy could include the difficulty encountered in fitting isochrones due to the abundance of field stars ( of which these two clusters suffer from more than ngc 2360 or ngc 2477 ) , or uncertainty in metallicity , distance , or reddening . in all cases ,",
    "the error bars on age found using the bayesian technique are considerably smaller , by an order of magnitude .",
    "more importantly , however , the most probable fit was determined in an objective and statistically robust way .",
    "we have employed a powerful software suite , base-9 , to determine the best - fit isochrones for four intermediate - age open clusters : ngc 2360 , ngc 2477 , ngc 2660 , and ngc 3960 .",
    "our primary interest is in high - precision cluster ages , which we determine to be 1.35 @xmath0 0.05 , 1.02 @xmath0 0.02 , 1.64 @xmath0 0.04 , and 0.860 @xmath0 0.04 gyr , respectively .",
    "this precision in age ranges from as little as 2% to @xmath14 5% uncertainty .",
    "this approaches a new level in high - precision stellar cluster ages .",
    "although by - eye methods can be used to approximate the best - fit values , they can not achieve the high precision of principled bayesian methods . given the expense of quality modern data , it is important to use a robust statistical approach that maximally leverages these valuable data .",
    "we emphasize the importance of such an objective technique as a way to determine higher precision ages and cluster properties , making better use of and providing useful feedback for stellar evolution models .",
