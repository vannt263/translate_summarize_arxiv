    "the asymptotic plateau problem in hyperbolic space asks the existence of a least area ( area minimizing ) plane @xmath2 asymptotic to given simple closed curve @xmath3 .",
    "this problem is solved by michael anderson in his seminal papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "he proved the existence of a solution for any given simple closed curve in the sphere at infinity .",
    "later , by using topological techniques , gabai proved a similar result for @xmath4 with any cocompact metric in @xcite .",
    "then , the author generalized these results to gromov hyperbolic @xmath5-spaces with cocompact metric @xcite .",
    "properly embeddedness of the solution has been questioned by both anderson and gabai .",
    "nevertheless , only known results about the properly embeddedness of least area planes in @xmath4 is the existence of some properly embedded least area plane for a given simple closed curve in @xmath6 by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is still not known if there exists a nonproperly embedded least area plane in @xmath4 whose asymptotic boundary is a simple closed curve in @xmath6 .    on the other hand , recently colding and minicozzi proved a very powerful result about properly embeddedness of complete embedded minimal disks in @xmath7 in @xcite .",
    "they proved calabi - yau conjectures for embedded surfaces by relating intrinsic distances and extrinsic distances of the minimal disk .",
    "as a corollary , they proved that any complete embedded minimal plane in @xmath7 must be proper .    in this paper ,",
    "we prove an analogous result in @xmath1 .",
    "we show that if @xmath0 is an embedded least area plane in @xmath4 whose asymptotic boundary is a simple closed curve with at least one smooth point , then @xmath0 is properly embedded in @xmath1 . instead of relating the intrinsic and extrinsic distances as colding and minicozzi did ,",
    "we use powerful topological arguments .",
    "the main result of the paper is as follows :    * theorem 5.2 .",

    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will cover some basic results which will be used in the following sections . in section 3 , we will analyze the intersection of a least area plane @xmath0 with balls exhausting @xmath4 . then in section 4",

    "a _ least area disk _ is a disk which has the smallest area among the disks with the same boundary .",

    "if an embedded surface @xmath11 in @xmath4 is proper , we will call @xmath11 as _ properly embedded_.    let @xmath12 be a subset of @xmath6 .",
    "then the _ convex hull _ of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is the smallest closed convex subset of @xmath4 which is asymptotic to @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath13 can be defined as the intersection of all supporting closed half - spaces of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is a well - known fact in minimal surface theory that if @xmath14 is a minimal surface in @xmath4 with @xmath15 , then @xmath16 .",

    "now , we can prove the main result of the paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete embedded least area plane in @xmath4 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a simple closed curve in @xmath6 with at least one smooth ( @xmath10 ) point .",
    "then , @xmath0 must be proper .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is not proper .",
    "then by lemma 5.1 , for any @xmath246 , there exist @xmath186 such that the intersection @xmath187 contains infinitely many separating disks .",
    "let @xmath247 be a path from @xmath54 to @xmath55 through @xmath32 .",

    "let @xmath253 be the family of paths in @xmath0 between @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "let @xmath256 .",
    "in other words , @xmath257 is the smallest closed ball among the balls @xmath258 where at least two of the disjoint disks in @xmath250 can be connected in @xmath259 .",
    "say , we can connect @xmath48 and @xmath260 in @xmath257 via path @xmath261 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the component of @xmath262 containing @xmath48 and @xmath260 , i.e. @xmath263 . because of the assumption on @xmath264 , @xmath265 .",
    "hence , @xmath266 in @xmath267 is a nonsimple closed curve ( with degenerate point @xmath268 ) .",
    "then , by changing the center a little bit from @xmath32 to @xmath269 , if necessary ; we can find a sufficiently small @xmath270 such that @xmath271 is a generic radius in the sense of lemma 3.1 , and the component @xmath272 in @xmath273 containing @xmath48 and @xmath260 is a nonseparating disk . since @xmath48 is a separating disk in @xmath274 , @xmath275 .",

    "since @xmath278 , this is a contradiction .",
    "the proof follows .",
    "as it is mentioned in the introduction , even though many experts of the field has questioned the problem , there is a very few results about the properly embeddedness of least area planes in @xmath4 .",
    "for example , it is still not known if there exists a nonproperly embedded least area plane in @xmath4 whose asymptotic boundary is a simple closed curve in @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", there is a construction by freedman and he communicated to gabai of a nonproper least area plane in @xmath1 .",
    "it is not clear to the author as to how a plane constructed in this manner can have limit set a simple closed curve .",
    "recently , colding and minicozzi solved an analogous question in @xmath7 in @xcite .",
    "they proved calabi - yau conjectures for embedded surfaces by relating intrinsic distances and extrinsic distances of the minimal disk .",
    "as a corollary , they proved that any complete embedded minimal plane in @xmath7 must be proper .",
    "our approach is very different from them as they use purely analytic methods , while our techniques are purely topological . when starting this problem , our aim is to prove the following conjecture . + * conjecture : * let @xmath0 be a complete embedded least area plane in @xmath4 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a simple closed curve in @xmath6 .",
    "then , @xmath0 must be proper .",
    "+ in this paper , we proved this statement with the existence of a smooth point condition on @xmath9 .",
    "we needed this condition for the key lemma to show existence of a least area annulus linking @xmath279 .",
    "if one can bypass this without the smooth point condition , then the theorem can be proved in full generality . on the other hand ,",
    "since the smooth point condition also means the finite thickness of @xmath56 in one direction , this might be an essential point for the result ."
