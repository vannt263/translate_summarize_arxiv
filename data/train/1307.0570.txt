    "the publication of the paper by bak and sneppen @xcite gave rise to a significant number of contributions in the literature both on evolution modeling and in related fields , regarding the analysis and application of this model , and other similar models .",
    "this interest has been explained on the basis of the simplicity of the model and its ability to capture some forms of complex behavior such as `` self - organized criticality '' , @xcite , a property that is often observed in physical and biological systems .",
    "these are of interest in the modeling of evolution processes but also of other processes .",
    "in particular , the model shows power - law behavior in the distribution of some of its performance measures , while not requiring the fine - tuning of any parameters to achieve this criticality , thus it is considered to be `` self - organized '' .",
    "the study of the theoretical properties of the model , and in general of related models presenting this self - organized criticality property , has been based mostly on the analysis of `` avalanches '' associated to its evolution .",
    "these avalanches are defined as epochs in the process between times when the fitnesses of all agents are above a certain threshold .",
    "in particular , in paczuski et al .",
    "@xcite some results were obtained on the evolution of the gap between avalanches and the span of an avalanche , for a class of self - organized models ( `` extremal '' models ) that included bak - sneppen .    in spite of the simplicity of the bak - sneppen ( bs ) model and the significant literature devoted to its study ,",
    "its properties have proven to be quite difficult to analyze in detail , and many of them are known mainly from simulation results . in meester and znamenski @xcite and @xcite , and meester et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , the non - triviality of the marginal distributions was proved and some parameters associated to the limiting distributions were studied , based on a characterization of the behavior of avalanches .",
    "other results establishing different properties of the limiting behavior of these avalanches in the bs model can be found in maslov @xcite and tabelow @xcite .",
    "a more detailed understanding of these models can be obtained from the consideration of simplified versions , which would still preserve some of the interesting characteristics of bs while being much more amenable to analysis .",
    "one of the first modifications to be considered was the `` mean - field '' variant of bs , that is , the case when the replaced agents were chosen as the one with the minimum fitness and a fixed number of other agents selected at random .",
    "this model was studied in de boer et al .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that power laws were still obtained for the distribution of avalanche durations .",
    "meester and znamenski @xcite present another model where fitnesses were required to take the values either 0 or 1 , and show that it exhibits non - trivial behavior .",
    "another promising and more complex approach to approximate the models of interest has been proposed by grinfeld et al .",
    "@xcite . they introduced and adapted so - called `` rank - driven '' processes , that is , processes where the agents to be replaced are defined in terms of the order statistics of the current population distribution .",
    "these processes have been described in detail , and their limiting properties have been characterized for some cases , in grinfeld et al .",
    "in particular , they showed that if the replacements were chosen from a uniform distribution , the limiting distribution for appropriate rank - driven processes had a structure similar to that observed in simulations of a bs process .",
    "we are interested in considering situations that extend these cases to more general settings .",
    "there is no perfect equivalence between a bak - sneppen process and rank - driven processes .",
    "nevertheless , the results available show that the limiting marginal distributions of these processes provide reasonable approximations to study the limiting behavior of the bak - sneppen process and some of its extensions .",
    "the usefulness of these processes as approximations for other more complex ones , as well as their flexibility to generate different types of limiting behaviors , provide our main motivation to study this class of processes .",
    "we introduce a simplifying hypothesis , namely that our observations are statistically independent .",
    "we then use the resulting approximate theory to characterize the limiting distribution of rank - driven processes for any continuous replacement distributions , in a manner that is simple and computationally tractable .",
    "the result is a new type of dimensional dynamical system acting on the space of cumulative distribution functions , and whose solutions are accessible through analysis .",
    "we will denote these systems by _ rank - driven dynamical systems_.    these same procedures are also used to analyze the behavior of the system in a case that has not been previously considered in the literature , namely when the replacements are taken from the same population ( the `` endogenous '' case ) . also here",
    "the limiting measures are easily computable .",
    "an interesting dichotomy occurs . in the endogenous case",
    "the limiting measure is singular with respect to lebesgue . in the case",
    "discussed above where the replacements are taken from an unchanging distribution  we refer to this situation as the _ exogenous _ case , the limiting measures for many reasonable initial conditions are absolutely continuous , though in some cases the underlying exact solution may still be singular ( see section [ chap : discussion ] ) .",
    "thus , endogenous evolution may optimize fitness if the conditions are right , but all agents tend to become identical ( no diversity ) .",
    "exogenous evolution on the other hand can also improve fitness , but often diversity is retained : a nontrivial _ range _ of fitnesses is preserved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ chap : interlude ] we present the rank - driven processes of interest , and we enumerate some well - known results on the distribution of order statistics .",
    "section [ chap : zero ] characterizes the temporal evolution of the process under endogenous and exogenous replacement schemes .",
    "it also introduces and justifies the main characterization results for both of these cases . in section [ chap : two ] we give some examples of these dynamics and show that we get behaviors similar to those observed under the bs model .",
    "section [ chap : asympt ] presents a precise characterization of the limiting measure ( in the limit for many agents ) for exogenous replacement schemes similar to , but much more general then , the one used in the bs model . in the last section",
    "we compare our approximation to the known exact solution for a particular system .",
    "in the bak - sneppen model , the lowest value plus its two immediate neighbors in a given graph @xmath1 are replaced by random values from a known distribution @xmath2 .",
    "this procedure introduces a `` geometric '' dependence that greatly complicates its analysis .",
    "simulation results indicate that after many iterations the neighbors of the worst performer consist of ( on average ) one very bad performer and one ( @xmath2- ) average performer .",
    "indeed , it appears very hard to prove these correlations ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to approximate the bs model by a rank - driven model whose parameters can be chosen to obtain a model that is much more tractable and provides a close approximation .",
    "we now introduce a ( simplified ) formal model for this system , and its associated notation .",
    "let @xmath3 be a distribution function for a distribution supported on @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be a sample of @xmath5 ( almost surely distinct ) random variables with marginal distribution @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath6 = r(x)$ ] for each @xmath7 . denote the corresponding order statistics @xmath8 , and the marginal distribution function of the @xmath7-th order statistic by @xmath9 $ ] , where the notation @xmath10 is motivated by our interest in the study of the properties of @xmath3 .",
    "consider the @xmath11-out - of-@xmath5 order - statistics @xmath12 from a set of identically distributed observations .",
    "their distributions @xmath13 satisfy : @xmath14 [ lem : order - stats ]    it holds that @xmath15 and taking expectations , @xmath16    let @xmath17 denote the empirical distribution of @xmath1 : @xmath18 then , @xmath19 = r(x ) , \\ ] ] and @xmath3 is also the one - dimensional marginal distribution of a randomly chosen member of @xmath20 .",
    "the characterization of this distribution is the object of interest of this paper .",
    "assume now a random index @xmath21 , uniformly distributed on @xmath22 .",
    "it holds that @xmath23 ] = \\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\theta_{i : n } ( r ) ( x ) = r(x ) .\\ ] ]    on the model described above , we will conduct the following stochastic `` update '' : let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be independent ( and independent of @xmath20 ) , with @xmath26 = 1 - { \\cal p}[\\xi_i = 0 ] = \\alpha_i \\in [ 0,1]$ ] , and @xmath27 = n(x)$ ] . construct @xmath28 by , for each @xmath7 , selecting @xmath29 if @xmath30 or @xmath31 if @xmath32 : @xmath33",
    "then the `` updated '' empirical distribution corresponding to @xmath28 is @xmath34 using lemma [ lem : order - stats ] it follows that @xmath35 & = & \\frac1n { \\mathbb e } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i 1\\ { y_i \\leq x \\ } + \\frac1n { \\mathbb e } \\sum_{i=1}^n 1\\ { g_{(i ) } \\leq x \\ } - \\frac1n { \\mathbb e } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i 1\\ { g_{(i ) } \\leq x \\ } \\\\   & = & \\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i n(x ) + r(x ) - \\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i \\theta_{i : n } ( r ) ( x ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the one - dimensional marginal of a randomly chosen member of the new sample @xmath28 .",
    "the iteration of this update will be the basis to define the dynamics of our rank - driven dynamical system .    at this point",
    "we introduce a distinction between exogenous and endogenous evolution in a rank - driven dynamical system . in the first case",
    "the cdf @xmath36 represents individuals from an outside ( _ exogenous _ ) distribution replacing disappearing individuals .",
    "thus in _ exogenous _ evolution we consider @xmath36 to be fixed .",
    "one can say that in this case @xmath36 is the distribution that `` drives '' the dynamics .",
    "in contrast , _ endogenous _ evolution would replace the selected fitnesses with new fitnesses from the same distribution .",
    "those new individuals are thus taken from the same ( marginal ) distribution as the disappearing individuals .",
    "thus in this case the driving measure is @xmath3 itself .",
    "the following are the equations governing exogenous and endogenous evolution ( @xmath37 fixed ) for a rank - driven system @xmath38 where for all @xmath7 , @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "[ defn : exo - endo ]    note that from lemma [ lem : order - stats ] , @xmath40 in definition [ defn : exo - endo ] can be written as @xmath41 since @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath2 and @xmath10 are distributions , it follows that @xmath43 is also a distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "both equations map the space @xmath44)$ ] of cumulative distribution functions on @xmath0 $ ] to itself .",
    "the intuition behind this exogenous dynamic model is that at each iteration we take out some values , namely for each @xmath7 we take out ( on the average ) @xmath45 times the @xmath7-th lowest value , and replace those by random values from the cdf @xmath2 .",
    "our goal is the study of the marginal cumulative stationary distribution functions ( with support in @xmath0 $ ] ) of the values @xmath1 .",
    "this study will be based on the properties of order statistics , and in particular on the characterization of their distribution functions .",
    "to conduct this analysis we will impose the additional assumption that , at each stage , the @xmath46 are independent draws from their marginal distribution . under this independence assumption , we now present several well - known results related to the behavior of order statistics and their distributions .",
    "most of these results are standard and can be found in many basic references , such as for example @xcite .",
    "these are presented without proof .    given a ( cumulative ) distribution ( function ) @xmath47 , for the @xmath11-out - of-@xmath5 order - statistics @xmath12 from an independent set of trials we have distribution functions @xmath13 , @xmath48 [ theo : order - statistics ]    the partial of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath3 is non - negative , and is strictly positive if @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore we have that @xmath50 [ lem : derivatives ]    this result follows from the expressions for @xmath13 in theorem [ theo : order - statistics ] being differentiable with respect to @xmath3 , and satisfying @xmath51    let @xmath45 as in definition [ defn : exo - endo ]",
    ". then @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "it can only be equal to one if @xmath47 is 0 or 1 .",
    "[ lem : derivatives2 ]    we note that @xmath53 which , by lemma [ lem : order - stats ] , equals : @xmath54 since all the coefficients are nonnegative , we have that by the previous lemma each of these two terms is nonnegative with the extremal case only possible if @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "it is amusing to illustrate these concepts with a simple coin - toss example . as usual",
    "we denote the heaviside step function with the step at @xmath57 by @xmath58 and its distributional derivative the delta function by @xmath59 .",
    "suppose @xmath60 this corresponds to throwing head ( = 0 ) or tail ( = 1 ) with equal probability .",
    "one easily checks that for a set of two independent trials one has a probability of @xmath61 that the lowest throw is a 0 and the same probability that the highest throw is a 1 .",
    "indeed the formulae of theorem [ theo : order - statistics ] give us that @xmath62 note that these distributions sum to @xmath63 as in lemma [ lem : order - stats ] and that their derivatives with respect to @xmath3 satisfy lemma [ lem : derivatives ] .",
    "it is also straightforward to check from this that @xmath64 these expression illustrate the fact that even though the @xmath65 may very well be singular , the @xmath66 are smooth polynomials in @xmath3 .",
    "as we mentioned above , in order to work with a manageable representation of the distribution functions of the order statistics , we will study the system assuming that the different components of @xmath1 were independent .",
    "note that in general , even if we start with @xmath5 i.i.d .",
    "random variables , this independence property will not be preserved by our dynamical systems .",
    "thus , this assumption would seem to be quite strong , but we believe it is not entirely unjustified . for example , it has been observed that it appears that in the limit as @xmath67 the fitnesses behave as if they are independent @xcite , and that at the end of an avalanche the fitnesses of the elements affected by it are independent @xcite . also , it seems reasonable to assume that the stationary distribution for this process is at least interchangeable , implying that its marginal distribution could be recovered from the fixed - point of the dynamical system under the independence assumption .",
    "one interesting insight resulting from our assumption and our ability to recover the limiting behavior of the marginal distributions in the bs model , see section [ chap : asympt ] , is that the dependence structure of these models does not seem to impact this limiting behavior .",
    "note that we impose the condition that the @xmath68 and @xmath29 used to define our iteration are independent , and independent of @xmath20 .",
    "this condition corresponds to the structure used in the model defined in @xcite .",
    "we now show that under this assumption the measures @xmath69 converge .",
    "let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be the dynamical systems on @xmath72 as given in definition [ defn : exo - endo ] .",
    "assume that at each step the distributions of the fitnesses are independent",

    "this model was thought to apply to the `` biological evolution of interacting species '' by its original authors ( see @xcite for further discussion of this aspect ) .",
    "other examples are for example the modeling of the dynamics of economic agents , see @xcite or @xcite , or the study of small - world networks , @xcite . as long as the components to be replaced are selected in an ( approximately ) independent manner , our theory shows that there is an essentially unique fixed point distribution which can easily be constructed from the initial distribution and the fixed distribution @xmath2 .    in the paper",
    "we also show that the behavior of these systems is quite different if the replacements come from the evolving distribution itself",
    ". that would be the case if the characteristics of the replacements are somehow inherited from those of the existing population . in this case",
    "we have show that again there is a unique fixed point that can easily be constructed from the initial distribution .",
    "the difference with the previous case is that in this case the limiting distribution is always a countably singular measure , while in the former case there are many plausible scenarios where the limiting measure actually has a non - singular density ."
