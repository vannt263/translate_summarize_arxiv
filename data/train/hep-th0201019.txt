    "in the past few years we have learned a lot about the physics of the strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories from the study of their supergravity duals @xcite .",
    "this progress is based on the ads / cft correspondence . in its basic version the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence is the equivalence between the @xmath5 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in four dimensions with the gauge group @xmath2 and the type iib superstring theory on the space @xmath6 .",
    "the radius of curvature of @xmath7 is equal to the radius of curvature of @xmath8 and is related to the parameters of the yang - mills theory : @xmath9 this equivalence is usually understood as a strong coupling duality , because the supergravity description of the type iib string theory is valid when @xmath10 , or @xmath11 .",
    "the loop counting parameter on the supergravity side is inversely proportional to the number of colors @xmath0 . therefore the leading large @xmath0 computations in the gauge theory correspond to the computations in the classical supergravity in the bulk . in the language of string theory",
    "this means that we are considering only the worldsheets with the topology of the sphere .",
    "suppose that we start decreasing @xmath12 keeping @xmath0 large .",
    "what happens on the string theory side ?",
    "we should still consider only the spherical worldsheets ; higher genus surfaces will correspond to @xmath13 corrections .",
    "however the worldsheet sigma model becomes strongly interacting .",
    "this suggests that from the spacetime point of view we will be dealing with some complicated classical theory .",
    "we can study this classical theory by looking at its boundary s - matrix , which is read from the correlation functions in the free theory on the boundary .",
    "this program was initiated in @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath14 the theory on the boundary becomes the free @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills .",
    "consider the correlation functions of @xmath15 primary operators in the free field theory .",
    "when @xmath3 the correlation function factorizes into the product of @xmath16 two point correlation functions .",
    "this means that the theory in the bulk in this limit should be a free theory .",
    "the fields of this free theory should correspond to the primary operators in the free theory on the boundary .",
    "since the primary operators on the boundary are in general tensors of the arbitrary rank , in the bulk there should be many tensor fields of the arbitrary rank .",
    "perhaps one should think of these higher spin fields as corresponding to the excited states of the string whose mass in the limit @xmath10 is determined by the radius of the ads space rather than the string length .",
    "when @xmath0 is finite , the correlation functions of the gauge invariant operators on the boundary do not factorize into the product of the two point functions .",
    "this corresponds to introducing the interactions in the bulk .",
    "it is crucial that the strength of the interaction depends on @xmath0 and can be made arbitrary small by making @xmath0 very large . for finite large @xmath0 , the leading @xmath13 contribution to the connected correlation function",
    "is given by the tree diagrams .",
    "this means that the correlation functions on the boundary define a classical higher spin theory in the bulk , with the coupling constants the positive powers of @xmath13 .",
    "one can ask whether this theory has local interactions , that is whether the vertices have a finite number of field derivatives .",
    "if this is true , then it should be possible to determine the interaction vertices from the symmetries",
    ". the resulting local classical theory would be the effective description of the string theory in the ads space of the very small radius .",
    "we do not know any clear string theoretic argument showing that the interactions should be local .",
    "one can accept this statement as a hypothesis .",
    "it is remarkable that the problem of constructing the local interactions of the higher spin fields with the right symmetries is very old .",
    "the question was formulated by c.  fronsdal @xcite in 1978 .",
    "significant progress was achieved in the works of e.s .",
    "fradkin and m.a .",
    "vasiliev @xcite and in the following papers ( see @xcite and references therein . )",

    "_ the free field theory has a large group of symmetries involving the higher derivatives of the fields @xcite .",
    "it is natural to try to find the theory in the bulk which has this large symmetry group as the group of gauge symmetries .",
    "this group contains scalar gauge symmetries acting on the fields without derivatives and conformal symmetries acting with one derivative .",
    "these two types of symmetries generate two closed subgroups , and these are presumably the only symmetries preserved by the interactions . in the large radius ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the corresponding gauge fields in the bulk are the vector gauge fields and the spin two gauge field  the graviton . the other symmetries exist only in the free theory .",
    "the corresponding gauge fields in the bulk should be the higher spin gauge fields .",
    "in fact , the correlation functions in the field theory are almost fixed by the symmetry ( we will discuss `` almost '' in section 6 ) .",
    "this suggests that if there is a theory in the bulk having this large group of symmetries then this theory should be unique",
    ". it would be enough for the purpose of reproducing the correct correlation functions on the boundary to have this higher spin symmetry as a global symmetry group .",
    "but we know that it should be a gauge symmetry .",
    "the current operators generating the higher spin symmetry on the boundary should correspond to the massless fields in the bulk .",
    "for the theory of massless fields to be consistent one needs gauge invariance .",

    "the set of such operators is closed under the operator product expansion .",

    "we use the general interpretation of the ope in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . consider @xmath20 operators @xmath21 inserted at the points @xmath22 on the boundary .",
    "consider the diagram with @xmath20 external lines being boundary to bulk propagators ending on @xmath23 and one external line being the bulk to bulk propagator for the bulk field @xmath24 to the point @xmath25 inside ads :    here @xmath24 is the field in the bulk corresponding to the primary operator @xmath26 on the boundary .",
    "this diagram defines a function @xmath27 in ads .",
    "the projection of @xmath27 on the space of zero modes of the kinetic operator for the field @xmath24 gives a solution @xmath28 of the free equation of motion for @xmath24 .",
    "this solution corresponds to some operator on the boundary .",
    "this operator has the following meaning : it is the contribution to the operator product expansion @xmath29 of the single trace primary operator @xmath30 and its descendants . for the free theory on the boundary , we know that the only single trace primaries in the ope of the traces of the bilinears are the traces of the bilinears .",
    "this implies that if @xmath26 is not a bilinear in the free fields , then @xmath31 the consistent truncation requires that for @xmath32 not a bilinear in the free fields @xmath33 .",
    "this is a stronger condition than ( [ weaker ] ) .",
    "one could imagine that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "however this is unlikely if the interactions are local . if @xmath34 and @xmath35 , this most probably implies that the interaction vertex contains the kinetic operator acting on @xmath24 .",
    "but in this case the interaction vertex can be eliminated by the redefinition of the other interaction vertices .",
    "the existence of the truncation allows us to consider a simplified problem . before looking for the theory in the bulk reproducing the correlation functions of arbitrary primary operators",
    ", one can ask about the theory describing only the traces of the bilinears .",
    "in fact , one can truncate the theory even further .",
    "consider the bilinears in the free fields which involve only scalars : @xmath36 .",
    "there are also bilinears involving the gauge field and the fermions .",
    "but we think that there should be a consistent truncation to the bilinears involving only the scalars .",
    "the reason is again that all the operators in the operator product expansion of the product of the bilinears of scalars involve only scalars .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on this simplified theory , which describes only bilinears in scalars .",
    "the currents generating the higher spin symmetries are the traces of the expressions bilinear in the free fields .",
    "in fact , all the primary fields in the free scalar theory which are bilinears in the free fields are the conserved currents .",
    "therefore all the operators bilinear in fields are either conserved currents or their descendants .",
    "the correlation functions of the bilinears have the following dependence on @xmath0 : @xmath37 \\rangle \\simeq { 1\\over n^{n-2}}\\ ] ] this means that in the dual theory , vertices with @xmath20 lines should count with the coefficient @xmath38 :    therefore @xmath13 is the coupling constant of the theory in the bulk .",
    "_ in this paper we will discuss the free ( @xmath3 ) theory in the bulk . in section 2 we will review the structure of the higher spin currents in the theory of the free scalar fields . in section 3",
    "we will study the solutions of the free higher spin equations in ads space .",
    "we explicitly construct the boundary to bulk propagator and show that the solutions of the free field equations are in one to one correspondence with those deformations of the free field action which are bilinear in the free fields .",

    "we review the algebraic structure of the higher spin symmetries and prove that the higher spin symmetries determine the correlation functions up to the finite number of parameters .",
    "this implies that the higher spin theory with the right gauge symmetry will automatically reproduce the correlation functions of the free theory on the boundary .",
