    "the discovery of extragalactic objects with very low heavy element abundance was made by searle and sargent ( 1972 ) who reported on the properties of two intriguing galaxies , izw18 and iizw40 .",
    "they emphasised that they could be genuinely young galaxies in the process of formation , because of their extreme metal under - abundance , more than 10 times less than solar , and even more extreme than that of hii regions found in the outskirts of spiral galaxies . at the time of this discovery",
    "the general wisdom that most galaxies ( in particular the ellipticals ) had been formed over a short period during a dynamical free fall time of few @xmath1 years ( eggen et al . 1962 ) started to be challenged ( e.g. searle and zinn 1978 ) .",
    "it is also during the 70s that the first hierarchical models of galaxy formation were constructed ( press and schechter 1974 ) .",
    "because dwarf galaxies condense from smaller perturbations than giants , the cold dark matter models ( cdm ) predict that low mass galaxies could still be forming at the present epoch .",
    "the discovery by searle and sargent ( 1972 ) has been an impressive stroke , since one of these two galaxies ( izw18 ) is still in the book of records , as we shall later elaborate more on .",
    "these two objects gave rise to many systematic searches for more objects in a quest for local genuine young galaxies or  unevolved galaxies \" , depending upon the alternative viewpoints that some galaxies could be caught in the process of formation or that they simply were the result of a very mild evolution over the hubble time .",
    "these galaxies had the advantage of being gas - rich , with spectra dominated by strong emission lines ( see fig .",
    "6 ) favouring their detection .",
    "many techniques have been employed to find them , sometimes at large distances despite their intrinsic low luminosity .",
    "the last nearly three decades have brought a wealth of data from numerous studies on dwarf galaxies , including information on their chemical composition .",
    "it became clear that `` metal - poor '' would be analogous of `` low mass '' galaxies ( lequeux et al . 1979 ) .",
    "for this reason , our review will largely focus on dwarf galaxies , but we shall address the question of the existence of large and massive proto - galaxies - essentially devoid of metals - at large redshift in the last section .",
    "the dwarf galaxies are not only interesting for understanding the process of galaxy formation . for the gas - rich ones with active star formation , one motivation to study them",
    "has been the hope to better understand the processes of massive star formation in low metallicity gas .",
    "they turn out to be test cases for chemical evolutionary models and offer the possibility to approach the primordial helium abundance with a minimum of extrapolation to early conditions .",
    "many galaxies of different kinds can be identified as metal - poor and it is an interesting question to find out about the connections that bridge them together . finally , a lot of new studies concentrate on the impact of massive star formation onto the interstellar medium ( ism ) in star - bursting dwarf objects , that in turn can lead to constrain the supernovae rate , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the metal dependence of the winds in wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars etc .",
    "in fact there are many issues in astronomy where it is essential to understand dwarf galaxies ( actively forming stars or not ) .    a definition of what",
    "is a metal - poor galaxy is indeed necessary at this point . to define the metallicity ( @xmath2",
    ", i.e. the mass fraction elements other than hydrogen and helium ) of a galaxy requires some words of caution because in a given galaxy , depending on where one looks , this quantity may vary substantially .",
    "for example in our galaxy , the bulge , the solar neighbourhood and the halo differ in metallicity .",
    "the most metal - poor halo stars have heavy element abundances 10@xmath3 times that of the sun ( cayrel 1996 ) while stars in the galactic centre may be three times more metal rich than the sun .",
    "on the other hand , the large ionised complexes in the ism show a narrower range down to only 1/10 the solar value .",
    "thus metallicity depends on what one looks at : stars or gas , and if one considers gas  what phase : neutral atomic , molecular or ionised ?",
    "moreover the metallicity of stars is found to depend on their age , and depends on which elements are investigated . that a star or nebula is deficient of a certain element does not automatically mean that the overall chemical abundances are low .",
    "thus , one must be careful in defining what metallicity means for a given galaxy before comparing observations and looking for trends .",
    "another complication stems from the different techniques in use for determining chemical abundances .",
    "metallicities of local group dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) have largely been investigated through photometry of their resolved stellar populations , which are dominated by old stars , and they are found to be metal - poor , as measured by [ fe / h ] .",
    "in general dsph galaxies contain little or no gas , and no hii regions .",
    "dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxies on the other hand usually have plenty of gas and ongoing star formation as witnessed by the presence of hii regions .",
    "it is relatively easy to derive metallicities , especially oxygen ( o ) of the ionised gas in hii regions explaining why most investigations are based on such .",
    "hence the `` metallicity '' of dsphs and dis measures quantities that are not directly comparable . for galaxies which have no hii regions and very low surface brightness , the only available spectroscopic method hitherto , has been to study individual bright stars which are within reach in nearby galaxies only . in more distant galaxies , individual stars are not observable and the metallicity has to be inferred from either absorption line spectra of an integrated stellar population ( not necessarily homogeneous in age or composition ) or from the nebular emission lines , if any .",
    "again , the different methods in general measure different elements .",
    "so what useful definitions of `` metallicity ''",
    "do we have at hand ?",
    "the possibility of using the metallicity of the hii regions has the advantage of providing an `` up to date '' metallicity , while stars provide the metallicity of the cloud from where they were born , perhaps a hubble time ago .",
    "nebular abundances show large spatial abundance variations and gradients in some galaxies , e.g. giant spiral galaxies , like the milky way .",
    "although measurable abundance inhomogeneities could be expected , most dwarf galaxies seem rather well mixed .",
    "a possible problem with metal - poor hii regions is self - pollution of fresh metals by winds from young massive stars , so that the abundance inferred from the nebular emission lines may not be representative of that in the local ism ( kunth & sargent 1986 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the metallicity of the stars in a galaxy depends on which stellar population is studied .",
    "thus it is not surprising , in particular for galaxies which have experienced continuous star formation , that stars have different abundances .",
    "integrated spectra of galaxies provide a luminosity - weighted average of the metallicity .",
    "this average metallicity will change with time due to the photometric evolution of the stellar population , even if no new stars are formed .",
    "a good , well defined , metallicity indicator would be the fraction of baryonic matter that has been converted into heavier elements by means of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "this material may have been returned to the ism or may still be locked up in stars .",
    "such a definition would indicate that our main interest goes beyond the element abundances themselves from the fact that they provide information about the history of a galaxy .",
    "the relative abundances and gas mass fractions might unveil different histories among galaxies with the same metallicities .",
    "however , it is clear from he above discussion that such a definition of metallicity remains impractical , since not directly measurable .",
    "however , we would like to keep this ideal definition in mind for the rest of the discussion .",
    "now we wish to go back to the question  what is a metal - poor galaxy ? under the assumption that various tracers give a plausible picture about the `` ideal metallicity '' we can now try to compare different kinds of galaxies",
    ". one of the most fundamental parameters for a galaxy is of course its mass .",
    "this mass , which may consist of stars , gas , dust , baryonic- and non - baryonic dark matter , is more difficult to measure , than e.g. the luminosity , but to the first approximation , mass and luminosity correlate .",
    "based on their luminosity and size , galaxies can be divided into dwarfs and giants .",
    "it has been found that the metallicity of a galaxy in the local universe correlates positively with its luminosity ( although with a large scatter ) , thus also reflecting a positive correlation with mass .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is a fundamental issue to understand .",
    "one explanation could be that dwarfs evolve more slowly because of smaller mass densities , which to the first order fits with the observation that dwarfs , except dwarf elliptical / spheroidals , are more gas - rich than giants .",
    "another possible explanation is that dwarfs have weaker gravitational potentials hence are more susceptible to loose metal enriched material from supernova driven winds .",
    "a natural reference for element abundances and the ratio between them , could be the sun .",
    "thus a starting point could be that `` metal - poor '' means anything which has sub - solar abundances and vice versa for `` metal rich '' , which implies that basically all local galaxies fainter than our galaxy are metal - poor .",
    "high redshift neutral gas clouds , which may be the building blocks of today s galaxies , are observed to have metallicities down to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , there is a large range of metallicity to explore , and it is meaningful to distinguish between metal - poor , very metal - poor and extremely metal - poor .",
    "since this review is called `` the most metal - poor galaxies '' it is natural that we focus on the latter two subclasses .",
    "what do we see locally ?",
    "among dsph we find metallicities extending down to 1/100 @xmath5 , while the lmc and smc are at roughly 1/3 @xmath5 and 1/8 @xmath5 respectively .",
    "dwarf irregulars have sub - solar abundances , ranging down to 1/40 @xmath5 .",
    "in addition there are many blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) in the range 1/10 to 1/50 @xmath5 , with , as we shall show later , izw18 at the extreme .",
    "a more workable definition could use the minimum enrichment one predicts for a single burst of star formation , using the instantaneous recycling closed box model .",
    "kunth and sargent ( 1986 ) found that such minimal expected metallicity increment in a pristine hii region would be higher than or equal to the metallicity of izw18 .",
    "similarly one finds that even converting only on the order of two percent of pristine gas in a galaxy to stars , results in a metallicity of 1/50 @xmath5 , i.e. the metallicity of izw18 .",
    "there are of course a lot of uncertainties that go into these calculations , but they can be a useful guide .",
    "another , more practical guide , is to consider the o / h distribution of star forming dwarf galaxies studied over the last 30 years .",
    "this shows a peak around 1/10 @xmath5 and drops sharply below that value .",
    "moreover , for most models : of stellar winds , evolutionary tracks , wr - stars , star formation etc . , a critical dependence on metallicity is seen around 1/10 @xmath5 .",
    "this is why we have adopted throughout this review the working hypothesis that galaxies with metallicity below 1/10 @xmath5 will be considered as very metal deficient .",
    "therefore galaxies like the magellanic clouds will not be our main interest in this paper .",
    "moreover , such a limit means that this review will be biased towards dwarf galaxies .",
    "in particular we will focus on blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "the reason is partly due to selection effects : since blue compact galaxies have bright emission lines and high surface brightness , it is fairly easy to discover them and derive their metal content .",
    "thus , there exists a lot of high quality data on bcgs , but we should keep in mind that very metal - poor galaxies may be as common among other types of dwarf galaxies .",
    "metallicities can be studied at great distances under special conditions .",
    "observations of high redshift qsos and radio galaxies ( e.g. dunlop et al .",
    "1994 ) , reveal the presence of dust and metal rich gas , suggesting that prior stellar nucleosynthesis has already taken place .",
    "high redshift qso absorption line systems show a wide range of metallicities , from one thousandth solar up to 1/3 solar .",
    "thus , while the average metallicity of the universe certainly must have increased since the early epochs , the situation is more complex than a simple picture where high redshift means metal - poor , and low redshift metal - rich",
    ". objects with high and low metallicities are found at all redshifts .",
    "surely we expect objects that in the local universe appear as metal deficient to be even more deficient at high redshift , if we could observe their precursors .",
    "also the ancestors of the local metal rich galaxy population , i.e. the giant spirals and ellipticals , should have started out with very low abundances unless they were gradually built up by merging smaller galaxies .",
    "currently , both the theoretical and observational pictures suggest that the latter is an important mechanism .",
    "dwarf galaxies , the survivors who form the local metal - poor galaxy population , may thus be the principal building blocks of the universe on large scales .",
    "the structure of the rest of paper is as follows : in section 2 we discuss how metallicities are measured and in sect .",
    "3 the physical mechanisms that control the metallicity of a galaxy . in section 4",
    "we review the physics of metal - poor galaxies in the local universe , while in sect .",
    "5 turning to some key objects like izw18 . in sect .",
    "6 we discuss survey techniques , and the distribution in space and luminosity of metal - poor galaxies . in sect .",
    "7 we examine observed trends in the metal - poor galaxy population and various possible evolutionary links . in sect .",
    "8 we focus on cosmology and the high redshift universe , and in sect .",
    "9 we conclude .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt 12+log(o / h)=8.91 as the solar oxygen abundance . as customary ,",
    "element ratios given in square brackets represent logarithmic values with respect to solar values , e.g. [ fe / h ] @xmath6 log(fe / h ) @xmath7 log(fe / h)@xmath8 .",
    "we use h@xmath9km / s / mpc , and rescale results from the litterature based on other values of h@xmath10 when necessary .",
    "a list of commonly used abbreviations and acronyms are given at the end of the paper .",
    "below we list the main ways that have been used to derive metallicities for metal - poor galaxies .",
    "one has to be aware that these different abundance estimators sample not only different elements , but also look - back times and population mixes .",
    "abundances are relatively easy to measure in star - forming dwarf galaxies because they contain gas clouds in which large numbers of hot stars are embedded .",
    "their spectra are dominated by nebular emission lines similar to those of high - excitation giant hii regions in late type spiral galaxies . what is observed in the optical are narrow emission lines superimposed on a blue stellar continuum ( see fig 6 . ) .",
    "they are identified as helium and hydrogen recombination lines and several forbidden lines .",
    "methods used in determining abundances are well understood and generally more reliable than those based on stellar absorption line data because transfer problems become of minor importance . from the optical , o ,",
    "n , s , ne , ar and he lines are currently measured . with modern detectors fainter lines such as lines of fe have been studied ( izotov and thuan , 1999 ) .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) region is dominated by the hot stellar continuum and shows relatively weak emission lines except for those that originate in stellar winds .",
    "however there are a few notable exceptions and owing to the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) and more recently the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nebular carbon and silicon abundances have been determined .",
    "oxygen is the most reliably determined element , since the most important ionisation stages can all be observed .",
    "moreover the [ oiii]@xmath11 line allows an accurate determination of the electron temperature . the intrinsic uncertainty in this method ( reflecting a simplified conception of the hii region physics , possible problems with temperature fluctuations etc .",
    ") is of the order of @xmath120.1 dex ( pagel 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , when the electron temperature can not be determined , empirical relations ( cf .",
    "pagel 1997 ) between the oxygen abundance and the [ oii]@xmath13 and [ oiii]@xmath14 strength relative to h@xmath15  are used , though with lower accuracy ( 0.2 dex or worse ) . for other species , in general",
    ", one does not observe all the ionisation stages expected to be present in the photoionisation region and an ionisation correction factor must be applied to derive the total abundance of the element in question .",
    "one important aspect of hii region abundances is that they can be obtained also at great distances .",
    "this makes them powerful tools also for studying high redshift galaxies , with the price that our view will be biased towards actively star - forming systems . for a discussion on possible problems associated with deriving abundances in very distant galaxies ,",
    "see kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) enable a spectroscopic abundance determination , using the same technique as for hii regions .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty due to temperature fluctuations ( peimbert 1967 ) and gradients is probably at least 0.1 dex ( pagel 1997 ) .",
    "the derived oxygen abundances reflect the initial composition of the star since the ejected gas that forms the pn has not been enriched in oxygen by the central nucleosynthesis ( however see remark below ) and that moreover , the hot ejecta has not mixed with the surrounding colder ism .",
    "the progenitor stars of pne have masses up to several times that of the sun , meaning that the derived o abundance traces the ism abundance 0.1 to several gyr ago , depending on the mass of the progenitor .",
    "this is a large range in lookback time over which significant chemical evolution may have occurred , and thus it is important to assess the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "a model that relates the oxygen abundance as derived from pne and hii regions ( i.e. the present ism abundance ) has been presented by richer et al .",
    "they find that the abundance gap , the difference between these two abundance estimators , is a function of the star formation history and metallicity .",
    "the more extended the epoch of star formation has been and the higher the ism metallicity , the larger the abundance gap .",
    "while the pne abundances of oxygen traces the ism abundance at the birth of the progenitor star , this is not true for carbon and nitrogen which have been enriched during the stellar evolution ( pagel 1997 , p. 199 ) .",
    "moreover for some types ( pne type i , cf . peimbert and serrano 1980 ) there might have been also enrichment of oxygen .",
    "colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) provide a photometric estimate of the stellar abundances , usually assumed to be represented by iron , from the colour of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "stars more massive than approximately 2 solar masses never ascend it and thus stars on the rgb have ages from approximately 1 to 15 gyr , and their abundance reflects the ism abundance of fe when the stars were born .",
    "the width of the rgb provides a measure of the metallicity spread , of course convolved with the broadening from age dispersion and the photometric error function ( see e.g. lee et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the calibration of this method rests upon the comparison of the rgbs with those of old galactic globular clusters with metallicity estimated from integrated spectroscopy or spectroscopy of individual giant stars ( see da costa and armandroff 1990 ) .",
    "therefore the rgb colour of an old population measures an average metallicity and is unable to reveal abundance ratios .",
    "moreover , comparison with old galactic globular clusters rests upon some degree of similarity between the two kinds of objects .",
    "however since it is now evident that the bulk of the stellar population in many des is younger than that of galactic globular clusters , and has a considerable abundance spread , one must be aware that physically different properties of globular clusters and galaxies may possibly cause systematic errors .",
    "other metallicity indicators include the colour and morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) in the cmd ( grebel 1998 ) , although this can not be uniquely translated into metallicities due to poorly understood `` second parameter effects '' , also known from the study of hbs in globular clusters .",
    "intermediate in character between photometric and spectroscopic abundance determinations is the fraction of carbon ( c ) stars among the late type giants , and the number of carbon rich ( wc ) to nitrogen rich ( wn ) wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "such indicators give only very crude guesses of the the metallicity .",
    "moreover , each population sample stellar populations of different age and are not directly comparable .",
    "a major drawback in using cmds for abundance determinations is that it is limited to nearby galaxies , basically the local group and its immediate surroundings .",
    "photometric abundances can also be derived using strmgren photometry .",
    "however the relatively narrow filters employed , limit the usefulness of strmgren photometry for extragalactic objects , a situation that could change with the new generation of large telescopes .",
    "there are also other photometric systems designed for metallicity sensitivity , e.g. the intermediate wide washington system .      in the nearest galaxies it is possible to spectroscopically determine the abundances of individual stars . while this method should yield accurate abundance determinations , it is not directly translatable into global values , since there are star to star variations and poor statistics ; in practice , only few stars , and in general the most luminous ,",
    "can be observed for each galaxy .",
    "the magellanic clouds have been accessible since more than a decade ( spite et al .",
    "1986 ; russell and bessell 1989 ; see also haser et al .",
    "1998 ) as well as the most nearby dwarf satellites of the milky way with present instrumentation ( e.g. shetrone et al . 1998 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of young metal - poor stars would also be of great importance for improving models of stellar evolution and population synthesis .    with the new generation of 8 m class telescopes , the distance to which individual luminous stars can be studied has been increased , and",
    "it is now possible to reach outside the local group .",
    "an outline of the merits of spectroscopy of luminous early type stars and on some work in progress can be found in kudritzki ( 1998 ) . in the near future",
    "the situation will change when 8 m class telescopes are equipped with spectrographs that allow observations of many stars simultaneously with sufficient spectral resolution .",
    "in remote galaxies without hii regions , integrated spectroscopy may be used to derive metal abundances .",
    "this method have been widely employed e.g. for giant ellipticals .",
    "absorption line features , such as the mg@xmath16 band , are compared to populations of observed or model stars to estimate metallicities ( cf .",
    "mould 1978 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "this method is difficult to use since the interplay between stellar population mixes , star formation history and stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , which influences the spectral shape and the absorption line strengths , is not known a priori ; and it has turned out to be non trivial to transform the observed mg@xmath16 strengths into metallicity . in addition , there are indications of nonsolar [ mg / fe ] values ( e.g. worthey et al .",
    "1992 ) . since , in general , the surface brightnesses of dwarf galaxies decrease with decreasing luminosity , even integrated spectroscopy is difficult and time consuming , and practically impossible for the really faint dwarfs .",
    "integrated photometry is a poor - man s tool .",
    "when no spectroscopic information may be obtained and the galaxy is too distant to resolve the stellar population , some constraints may be put on the metallicity ( cf .",
    "4.2.2 ) from integrated photometry under certain assumptions .",
    "however , as for the case of integrated spectroscopy ( but to a much greater extent ) , the assumed population mix , star formation history , imf , internal extinction etc .",
    ", influence the broad - band colours and make the derived metallicity very uncertain .",
    "the infamous age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy is here acting in its full power .",
    "if some of these parameters can be constrained , this method may be used in a statistical sense for large samples .",
    "another possible metallicity indicator is that of the cold ( neutral ) ism in a galaxy , where problems with self pollution should be small or absent . by using background continuum sources , absorption lines from the neutral ism",
    "may be used to estimate chemical abundances .",
    "kunth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used uv - absorption lines arising in the neutral gas in the line of sight towards the young stellar association in izw18 to derive oxygen abundances of the gaseous halo of izw18 .",
    "the method is similar to the one used for deriving abundances in qso absorption line system .",
    "this method is rather unexplored for galaxies , but may prove to be of future use if the difficulties due to line saturation can be tackled or circumvented ( pettini and lipman 1995 )    x - ray observations have been used to derive metallicity of the hot intra cluster medium in rich galaxy clusters , and has recently been applied also to starburst galaxies ( persic et al .",
    "x - ray observations are interesting because they may provide a means of observing `` hot '' metals produced in the current star formation event that have not yet mixed with the photoionised gas , and to study abundances in gas expelled by `` superwinds '' .    in principle , abundances may be derived also from radio observations .",
    "this has been done in the local ism in our galaxy . for external galaxies",
    "they have not been applied much due to sensitivity problems .",
    "co observations of dwarf galaxies are complicated by the fact that for low metallicities the co flux depends both on the mass and metallicity of the molecular gas complex .",
    "these questions may be further addressed by space based infrared spectroscopy .",
    "the chemical composition of the ism has been studied in the ultraviolet ( uv ) with e.g. the iue and hst satellite observatories .",
    "a relatively unexplored wavelength region is however the far uv .",
    "new space borne instruments like fuse ( far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) may be of importance here .",
    "other methods include observations of supernova remnants ( see pagel 1997 ) and the concept of dynamical metallicity , cf .",
    "haser et al .",
    "here we will discuss some mechanisms of importance for understanding why some galaxies are more metal - poor than others .",
    "it is unavoidable that this will include a discussion on nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models , however this is not the main scope of this paper and excellent reviews can be found elsewhere , e.g. pagel ( 1997 ) , matteucci ( 1996 ) , maeder ( 1992 ) , prantzos ( 1998 ) .      as the igm condenses into galaxies it contains the primordial abundances of h , d , @xmath17he , @xmath18he and @xmath19li .",
    "one of the beauties of some star - forming dwarf galaxies is that they can be so metal - poor that their abundance analysis bear strong cosmological implications .",
    "the current wisdom is that most of the element production in the universe , apart from the early `` big bang '' nucleosynthesis , occurs in stellar interiors .",
    "part of the products of stellar nucleosynthesis are released when stars die or in stellar winds from evolved stars , while another part remains locked up in stellar remnants : white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes .",
    "these remnants may not be completely sterile since in a binary system , accretion onto a white dwarf may lead to a type ia supernova .",
    "the end products that enrich the ism can be predicted from models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis . the returned mass in metals as a function of the initial mass is referred to as the stellar yield ( maeder 1992 ) .",
    "the absolute and relative yield for different elements depend on stellar mass in a non - linear fashion . moreover , the yields for the so called `` secondary '' elements depend themselves on the initial composition of the star .",
    "an example is @xmath20n , although observations strongly indicate the need also for primary production .",
    "furthermore the mass - loss history of stars needs to be accounted for , since elements that would have been subject to further nucleosynthesis might have been ejected , and also the effects of stellar binarity .",
    "unfortunately , the yields for many elements are still very uncertain , also for important elements like c and n ( prantzos , 1998 ) , and this has to be kept in mind when interpreting abundances and abundance ratios .",
    "the oxygen yield is among the best determined ones , still the uncertainty is around a factor of two .",
    "low mass stars ( @xmath21 ) are long lived and simply lock up part of the gas , since their lifetimes are longer than or comparable to the age of the universe . on the other hand they contribute to light and",
    "have imprinted in their chemical composition the conditions of the ism at the time and place they were formed .",
    "intermediate mass stars ( between 1 and 8 @xmath22 ) undergo dredge - up processes that significantly affect the c and n abundances and even the @xmath18he abundance , and such stars are important contributors to these elements . massive stars ( @xmath23 ) are short - lived and complete their evolution in less than @xmath24 years .",
    "as such a star collapses and becomes a neutron star its envelope is ejected in a supernova explosion , carrying away the earlier nucleosynthesis products and the ones resulting from explosive nucleosynthesis in the inner layers .",
    "this picture is still uncertain since the initial masses for which this is valid are not well known and it has been argued that some of the most massive stars may collapse into black holes , without an associated sn explosion . before their dramatic end ,",
    "massive stars undergo mass - loss processes via stellar winds as exemplified by wolf - rayet stars and other variable stars ( e.g. luminous blue variables ) that can carry away some cno processed material , reducing the yield of o and increasing that of c , n and he .",
    "the efficiency of stellar winds depend strongly on their chemical composition ( maeder 1992 ) since metals increase the opacity . at low metallicity",
    "the mass loss is small and the resulting he , c and o production is insensitive to the initial stellar composition , although it can be affected by the tendency of mass loss to increase with metallicity .",
    "hence one expects the yields of these elements to be metallicity dependent .",
    "in addition to stars losing part of their mass , a galaxy as a whole may be subject to mass loss , which will influence the ism abundances , ( see sect .",
    "3.3 ) . since",
    "different elements are produced in stars of different mass , they enrich the ism on different timescales .",
    "massive stars constitute the main source of oxygen and other @xmath0-elements , thus these elements are ejected on short timescales .",
    "also significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen are produced in massive stars . for iron ,",
    "massive stars dominate , but on long timescales the contribution from sn - ia produced in binary systems may be important .    the initial mass function ( imf , the distribution of stellar masses in a population of newly borne stars ) is a critical issue . to predict the element production of a population of stars , the stellar yields have to be convolved with the imf to form the _ net _ yield , defined as the mass of newly synthesised elements per unit mass locked up in remnants and long lived stars .",
    "unfortunately , the imf is not yet well determined even locally , and it is uncertain whether it is universal or depends on environment and metallicity . in most extragalactic studies",
    "the imf is assumed constant in time .",
    "this assumption needs to be examined with care although no observational evidence has convincingly contradicted it by now .",
    "the strongest claim by terlevich and melnick ( 1981 ) for imf variations with metal content of gas has never been compelling .",
    "there have been some suggestions that starburst galaxies should have an imf biased towards massive stars or deficient in low mass stars ( cf .",
    "scalo 1990 ) .",
    "however there is no direct evidence for this or for a low mass cut - off in giant hii regions like 30 doradus or in globular clusters .",
    "marconi et al . ( 1994 ) argue that the chemical evolution of starburst galaxies is well understood with a normal salpeter - like imf .",
    "currently it seems that , for massive and intermediate massive stars , the imf is reasonably well described with a power - law and a slope close to salpeter s ( 1955 ) original value while it flattens , but does not cut off , at masses below 1 @xmath22 . for a discussion on the imf , its derivation , and possible variations , see scalo ( 1998 ) .",
    "if the total mass involved in star formation at each instant is modest , the high mass part of the imf will be badly populated and consequently predictions for nucleosynthesis and spectral evolution will be sensitive to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the most important parameter of the chemical enrichment is expected to be the star formation history ( sfh ) . since massive stars",
    "dominate the production of most elements , the metal production rate will to a first approximation be directly proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "likewise , in a simple chemical evolution picture , the metallicity is a function of the fraction of gas turned into stars .",
    "star formation ( sf ) seems to occur in different modes : one being relatively undramatic with continuous star formation at a regular pace while in `` bursting '' galaxies , star formation may be dominated by a small number of short intense bursts of star formation separated by extremely long intervals of time .",
    "while the latter scenario is mainly observed in blue compact galaxies it is believed to occur also in dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "an intermediate picture is that of `` gasping '' sf , characterised by extended star formation episodes separated by moderately long periods of less active sf , which probably is the most realistic picture for many dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "while a starburst produces a lot of metals , the supernovae and stellar winds may eject gas into the intergalactic medium on short time scales .",
    "if , on the other hand , the sf is continuous , the energetic feedback from dying stars will have less influence on the ism .",
    "different scenarii for sf regulation have been implemented with stochastic self - propagating star formation , self regulated star formation and also a gas density threshold .",
    "moreover interactions , mergers and stripping may play an important rle in regulating the sf .",
    "discrete star - bursting behaviour in dwarf galaxies may strongly affect the abundance ratio of elements such as n , fe and c which partly come from longer lived intermediate mass stars as compared to o ( garnett 1990 , gilmore and wyse 1991 , richer and mccall 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , this could explain the tendency of c / o and fe / o to increase with o / h especially at low o / h , but this awaits more accurate measurements of these ratios in extremely metal - poor galaxies .",
    "moreover , since the net yield for many elements appears to be metallicity dependent ( maeder 1992 ) , element production by subsequent generations of stars will depend on how fast the ism is enriched and hence the star formation history .",
    "in addition , variations in element ratios could affect nucleosynthesis and thus the net yields for a given stellar generation .",
    "a last note concerns `` starbursts '' : this notion is frequently used in the literature to describe regions / galaxies with varying degree of active star formation .",
    "a proper definition of a starburst is that it involves an unsustainably high star formation rate ( sfr ) in terms of the gas consumption timescale or the timescale to build up the observed stellar mass ( i.e. the time averaged sfr is much lower than the present ) .",
    "many galaxies have sfrs fluctuating with time , but this does not necessarily imply that the sfr is unsustainable over a hubble time .      when massive stars are about to end their lives they explode as a supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the energy output from a sn is over a short period , comparable to that of a whole galaxy . in a galaxy with a high local star formation rate ,",
    "the collective action of supernovae may lead to a galactic superwind , which may cause loss of gas .",
    "stellar winds can also contribute to the energetics of the ism at the very early stage of a starburst ( leitherer et al .",
    "the relative importance of winds compared to sne increases with metallicity .",
    "a continuous wind proportional to the star formation rate has been applied in models predicting the evolution of starburst galaxies .",
    "but since different elements are produced on different timescales , it has been proposed that only certain elements are lost ( or in different proportions ) hence reducing the effective net yield of those metals as compared to a simple chemical evolution model ( matteucci and chiosi 1983 , edmunds 1990 ) .",
    "the sne involved in such a wind are likely to be of type ii because type ia sne explode in isolation and will less likely trigger chimneys from which metals can be ejected out of the plane of a galaxy . in this framework",
    "o and part of fe are lost while he and n ( largely produced by intermediate stars ) are not .",
    "this would result in a cosmic dispersion in element ratios such as n / o between galaxies that have experienced mass loss and those that have not .    in a dwarf galaxy which has a weaker gravitational potential",
    ", these effects may result in gas loss from the galaxy .",
    "recently galactic winds have been observationally investigated in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. israel and van driel 1990 , meurer et al .",
    "1992 ; marlowe et al . 1995 ; martin 1996,1998 ) . in vii  zw403",
    "papaderos et al .",
    "( 1994 ) detected extended x - ray plumes which they interpreted as the result of outflows of hot gas .",
    "lequeux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and kunth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that the escape of the ly@xmath0 photons in star - forming galaxies strongly depends on the dynamical properties of their interstellar medium .",
    "the lyman alpha profile in the bcg haro2 indicates a superwind of at least 200 km / s , carrying a mass of @xmath25 , which can be independently traced from the h@xmath0 component ( legrand et al .",
    "however , high speed winds do not necessary carry a lot of mass .",
    "martin ( 1996 ) argues that a bubble seen in izw18 ( see also petrosian et al .",
    "1997 ) will ultimately blow - out together with its hot gas component .",
    "although little is known about the interactions between the evolving supernova remnants , massive stellar bubbles and the ism it is possible that an outflow takes the fresh metals with it and in some cases leaves a galaxy totally cleaned of gas .",
    "will the gas leave a galaxy or simply stay around in the halo ?",
    "tenorio - tagle et al . ( 1999 ) point out that superbubbles may initially expand with speeds that well exceed the local escape velocity of the galaxy but their motion into the gaseous halo causes a continuous deceleration lowering the velocity to values well below the escape speed . in such a case , ejecta condense into a cold phase , forming droplets that fall back and settle down onto the disc of the galaxy hence changing the composition of the ism ( the `` galactic fountain '' model ) .",
    "similarly in chemodynamical models ( hensler and rieschick 1998 , and references therein ) , the gas cools and falls back . modelling the effect of sne feedback on the ism ,",
    "de young and heckman ( 1994 ) suggested that the smallest dwarfs could have their entire ism removed by a superwind .",
    "however , using models including dark matter , maclow and ferrara ( 1999 ) and ferrara and tolstoy ( 1999 ) conclude that winds are not very efficient in ejecting the ism .",
    "outflows are in most cases confined to the galaxy and `` blow - away '' occurs only for the smallest ( luminous mass @xmath26 ) galaxies considered , while in other cases the mass loss is very modest .",
    "winds may however still be efficient in ejecting fresh metals .",
    "ferrara and tolstoy ( 1999 ) nevertheless argue that outflows are not likely to be more metal rich than the average ism value .",
    "moreover , in their model , the sfr is a function of mass density which results in a mass  metallicity relation . since the least massive dwarfs loose their entire ism after the first star formation event , this results in a minimum expected ism metallicity for a gas rich dwarf of 12+log(o / h)=7.2 , i.e. the abundance of izw18 .",
    "many assumptions go into these calculations , which must be further examined .",
    "murakami and babul ( 1999 ) showed that in high density environments the igm pressure could confine outflows to the parent galaxies , inhibiting mass loss ( cf .",
    "babul and rees 1992 ) .",
    "it is clear that the rle of galactic winds in regulating the chemical evolution is not a settled issue yet . if the metallicity  luminosity relation ( cf .",
    "4.1 , 4.2 and 7.1 ) holds from gas - rich to gas - poor systems then the loss of metals due to galactic winds should be a second order effect ( skillman 1997 ) .",
    "it is also possible that a galaxy is subject to infall of gas , although evidence for this is scarce .",
    "infalling gas may come from external galaxies , stolen in the process of interaction or from an external origin , perhaps via isolated pristine hi clouds ( if such clouds exist ) .",
    "there is evidence that blue compact galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) are sometimes associated with hi clouds ( taylor 1997 ) , which in general have optical counterparts ( taylor , private communication ) .",
    "a third possibility is that gas expelled in a previous superwind falls back on its host galaxy .",
    "there are indications that infall of metal - poor gas , perhaps in the form of gassy dwarf galaxies , may have had major impact on the chemical evolution of the disc of our galaxy ( edvardsson et al .",
    "however one should recall that the existence of infalling gas on the galactic disc is well established , as inferred from high velocity clouds ( mirabel 1989 ) .",
    "infall of unpolluted gas could act as to lower the ism abundance .",
    "generally , models of galactic chemical evolution including infall assume pristine gas , but results with pre - enriched matter do not differ as long as the metallicity does not exceed @xmath27 ( tosi 1988 ) .",
    "it has become evident that interactions and merging between galaxies is a major driver in the evolution of galaxies , affecting the number evolution and morphological mix of the galaxy population .",
    "mergers and interactions will also affect the star formation activity in galaxies , and in this respect be important for chemical evolution .",
    "gas flow or accretion may lead to increased star formation ( sf ) activity or starbursts , whereas stripping or harassment in rich environments may inhibit sf .",
    "gas accretion may also affect ism abundances even if new star formation is not triggered , and may also provide a means for large scale mixing of the ism .",
    "are some dwarfs ejected debris from interacting disc galaxies , and what consequences for their chemical evolution would this have ?",
    "one would expect rather high metallicities , but if the process occurred long ago , before the interacting giants were enriched , this is not necessarily true .",
    "evidence that dwarf - like objects are being formed within the gaseous tails of the encounters is now quite well established ( e.g. duc and mirabel 1994 , 1998 ) , although their ultimate fate is unknown .",
    "abundance analysis shows that their metal content is comparable to that of the parent galaxies re - enforcing the view that the gas from which they originate comes from the central regions of their parents .",
    "another aspect is that many metal - poor dwarf galaxies in clustered environments may have been swallowed or torn apart by massive galaxies . the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , a recently discovered galactic satellite ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) , may perhaps be such a case .",
    "measured abundances in interstellar gas will of course depend on how well , and on what timescale , the ism is mixed and on what timescale fresh metal cools and becomes visible .",
    "kunth and sargent ( 1986 ) argue that hii regions are self - polluted within the ongoing burst providing the ejected oxygen can recombine fast enough to be observed in the hii zone while some can become neutral and be observed in the hi cloud .",
    "pantelaki and clayton ( 1987 ) dismiss this possibility from the fact that most of the ejecta should remain for a long time in the hot gas generated by sn events .",
    "spiral galaxies display radial abundance variations , indicating that radial mixing is inefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "barred spirals display smaller abundance gradients , since bar perturbations induce radial gas flows .",
    "roy and kunth ( 1995 ) discuss mixing processes in the ism of gas rich galaxies , and conclude that dwarf galaxies are expected to show kpc scale abundance inhomogeneities . on the other hand , chemodynamical models ( hensler and rieschick 1998 ) ,",
    "predict that the ism will be well mixed and chemically homogeneous through cloud evaporation .",
    "the observational situation is still not completely clear and rather few dwarfs have been subject to high quality studies of their chemical homogeneity .",
    "most dwarf irregulars seem rather homogeneous ( kobulnicky and skillman 1996 , kobulnicky 1998 ) with the exception of ngc  5253 where local n / h overabundances has been attributed to localised pollution from wr stars ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "there is also marginal evidence for a weak abundance gradient in the lmc ( on the scale of several kpc , kobulnicky 1998 ) .",
    "the situation is less clear in bcgs : in iizw40 , walsh and roy ( 1993 ) found a factor two variation in the oxygen abundance .",
    "izw18 appears to be rather homogeneous ( e.g. skillman and kennicutt 1993 , vilchez and iglesias - pramo 1998 , legrand et al . 1999 ) while recent spectroscopy of sbs0335 - 052 ( izotov et al .",
    "1999b ) reveals small but significant variations in accordance ( though to a much lesser extent ) with previous results ( melnick et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the possibility that metallicities in the neutral gas phase are orders of magnitude below the hii region abundances would be an ultimate test of large scale inhomogeneities .",
    "recent o / h abundance determination in the hi envelope of the very metal - poor compact dwarf izw18 ( kunth et al .",
    "1994 ) suggests the possibility of a striking discontinuity between the hi and hii gas phases : the measured o / h in the cold gas appears to be 30 times lower ( i.e. @xmath121/1000 @xmath5 ) than that of the associated hii region .",
    "note however that pettini and lipman ( 1995 ) have strongly warned against the use of the oi interstellar lines in deriving o / h for the neutral gas , mainly because these lines are saturated and the velocity dispersion is unknown ( see also van zee et al .",
    "a further hst observation of o and s lines in izw18 has unfortunately not produced consistent results ( unpublished ) .",
    "nevertheless thuan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) circumvented these problems in the case of sbs0335 - 052 although their result awaits independent measurement of unsaturated lines such as the sii@xmath28 multiplet .",
    "a crucial question would be how to interpret the presence of metals in the hi zone . if indeed izw18 experiences its very first episode of star formation , the oxygen present in the ionised gas should originate from the ongoing burst and one",
    "can speculate that metals in the hi were produced at an earlier epoch from population iii stars prior to the collapse of the proto galaxy . on the other hand",
    "the enrichment in the neutral gas could originate in a previous burst allowing for a time scale long enough to homogenise a cold cloud of 1 kpc diameter as discussed by roy and kunth ( 1995 ) , but see tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) . to circumvent the problem , legrand ( 1998 )",
    "has conjectured that in between bursts , izw18 had maintained a minimum continuous star formation rate of only @xmath29/yr over the last 14 gyrs .",
    "such a sfr is comparable to the lowest sfr observed in low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "this scenario nicely explains the lack of galaxies with metallicities below izw18 , the absence of hi clouds without optical counterparts and the homogeneity of the metal abundances in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the question of the metallicity of the cold neutral gas is indeed very important for understanding how much enrichment has really occurred , since for many galaxies , a considerable fraction of the total baryonic mass is in the form of neutral hydrogen . if some dwarfs are not well mixed on large scales ( e.g. lsbgs which have large hi - discs ) they would appear more metal - rich after converting a given fraction of gas into stars , because one would be observationally biased towards the star - forming , more metal rich regions . on the other hand ,",
    "if some dwarfs can mix their whole ism on not too long timescales , the fresh metals will be efficiently diluted and the galaxy appear more metal - poor .",
    "galaxies with very turbulent ism and those involved in mergers could possibly mix more easily on large scales .    once ejected into the ism , part of the metals",
    "may be locked up into dust grains .",
    "this is observed in the local ism for some elements ( see e.g. pagel 1997 ) and may result in strange element ratios and apparent under - abundances in extragalactic hii regions , although the effect is believed to be small for hii regions , due to grain destruction . in fact",
    "bautista and pradhan ( 1995 ) find that in the orion nebula , the depletion of iron into dust grains is probably a minor effect . in the colder gas associated with",
    "damped ly@xmath0 systems ( see sect . 8.2 ) depletion onto dust grains may be important for some elements .      with assumptions about stellar yields ,",
    "imf and star formation history , models of the chemical evolution of galaxies can be constructed .",
    "various assumptions such as instantaneous recycling and closed box ( i.e. the total mass of the system is conserved and perfectly mixed at all times ) allows one to construct simple analytic models ( cf .",
    "pagel 1997 ) . in the simplest case , with a constant net yield",
    ", the ism abundance will be a simple function of gas mass fraction ( @xmath30 )",
    ". however , many of the effects mentioned above are likely to complicate the real picture .",
    "many dwarfs are believed to undergo short bursts of star formation separated by long quiescent epochs .",
    "several additional ingredients were added to the closed - box models when it was realised that they could not account for the observed @xmath31 distribution by simply changing the number of bursts from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "models with normal or differential winds ( selectively enriched in heavy elements ) have been applied to starburst galaxies ( see matteucci 1996 for a review ) .",
    "they seem to be successful in reproducing the observed he / h vs. o / h distribution with a number of bursts between 7 and 10 in general , differential winds and various amounts of primary and secondary nitrogen from intermediate stars .",
    "this is in agreement with pilyugin s conclusions ( pilyugin 1992 , 1993 ) although other possibilities have been explored .",
    "for instance , one can vary the imf from galaxy to galaxy by changing the slope of the lower mass cut - off ( marconi et al .",
    "1994 ) while olofsson ( 1995 ) proposed that different behaviour of n / o versus o / h can be attributed to an effect of mass loss as a function of metallicity .",
    "on the other hand individual galaxies do not fit into these schemes whenever one enters into details .",
    "a few galaxies for instance tend to have large n / o for their their o / h .",
    "the galaxy izw18 falls into this category and one is forced to assume that n is produced as a primary element in massive stars .",
    "even this assumption does not relax the need for a strong star formation efficiency ( expressed as the inverse of the time scale of star formation ) and strong o - enriched winds ( kunth et al .",
    "note that recent work , e.g. by izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) on low metallicity bcgs , shows a reduced scatter for n / o and c / o at low abundances , to some extent removing the need for all the mechanisms originally invoked to produce a scatter . clearly , the way that chemical evolution in metal - poor galaxies proceeds is far from beeing a settled issue .",
    "more sophisticated `` chemodynamical '' models attempt to describe both the star formation history , its impact on the abundances and the interaction with the ism in a self consistent way .",
    "lately , these models have been applied to dwarf galaxies with some success ( hensler and rieschick 1998 ) .",
    "recent models of the chemical evolution versus redshift in the universe by cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) predict that metallicity shows a stronger dependence on the local density ( i.e. galaxy mass ) than on redshift , hence objects with high and low abundances are found at all @xmath32 . in the local universe ,",
    "these models predict that any region denser than the cosmic average ( a minimum requirement for a galaxy ) should have a metallicity of  @xmath33 or higher .",
    "here we will give an overview of the observed properties and chemical abundances of metal - poor galaxies , while in sect .",
    "5 we will discuss a few of these in more detail . as",
    "a metal - poor galaxy is in general a dwarf galaxy , this section will be biased towards dwarf galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies come in different kinds , with different properties and metallicities .",
    "there is a partial overlap in the classification and physics of metal - poor galaxies . at faint absolute magnitudes the dwarf irregular ( di ) , dwarf elliptical ( de ) and low surface brightness galaxy ( lsbg ) classes converge .",
    "moreover blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) to some extent overlap with actively star forming dis . the possible connections between different types of galaxies will be further discussed in sect .",
    "a lot of the data on di and de / dsph galaxies are from the local group .",
    "it is not our intent here to give a general description of the local group dwarfs , recent and excellent reviews can be found in e.g. mateo ( 1998 , which also contains a compilation of very useful data ) and grebel ( 1998 ) ; see also the book `` stellar astrophysics for the local group '' ( eds .",

    "we will only focus on those points that are relevant for the understanding of the most metal - poor galaxies .",
    "as we have mentioned , metallicity correlates with luminosity for galaxies , at least in the local universe .",
    "more metal rich galaxies are on average more luminous and have in addition higher surface brightness .",
    "this produces a bias against detecting metal - poor galaxies .",
    "moreover , except for hii region spectroscopy , most ways of measuring metallicity discriminate against low luminosity galaxies .",
    "dwarf irregulars are in general well described by exponential surface brightness profiles .",
    "they contain fair amounts of neutral and perhaps molecular gas and in general show evidence for star formation , at low ( or moderate ) rates .",
    "there are some examples of galaxies of intermediate type between di and de , e.g. the local group dwarfs pegasus and phoenix .",
    "such galaxies have no signs of ongoing star formation , but contain gas ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "dwarf irregulars partially overlap bcgs in the classification criteria , i.e. many bcgs are indeed irregular , and dis often contain bright hii regions which may be picked up in emission line surveys .",
    "of course the transition is gradual and to some extent arbitrary .",
    "there is also some overlap with the lsbg class of galaxies discussed in sect .",
    "the local group contains around a dozen ( depending on the magnitude limit ) dis most of which are rather metal - poor .",
    "dwarf irregulars are also found in the local field and in nearby clusters and groups , but metallicity determinations become rarer with increasing distance .",
    "dwarf irregulars in general show ongoing star formation and hii regions . the star formation history ( sfh ) of local group dis has been reviewed recently by grebel ( 1998 ) , and mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "most dis seem to have experienced more or less continuous star formation over a hubble time .",
    "many local group dis show evidence for an episodic star formation history to a varying degree ( e.g. leo a , tolstoy et al .",
    "1998 ) , but it is difficult to say if the past sfh should be described in terms of short bursts or more extended periods of increased sf as compared to the time averaged value . there seems to be no clear pattern when comparing different galaxies , i.e. no support for co - ordinated bursts .",
    "star formation in dis is probably governed by different mechanisms than in spiral galaxies , i.e. there are no density waves available for triggering star formation . despite their closeness , it is quite fair to say that the regulation of star formation in the local group dis ( and des too ) is not yet well understood .",
    "interactions , ram - pressure stripping , superwinds and other recipes have been suggested as processes governing the star formation history and morphological segregation , but results are still inconclusive .",

    "models with exponentially decreasing sfr ( e - folding time 3 gyr ) produced slightly better fits with similar metallicity and a median age of 11 gyr . assuming a distance of 16.2 mpc to the virgo cluster ( macri et al . 1999 ) we find a median luminosity @xmath41 , which with a median metallicity of @xmath36[fe / h]@xmath42 means that the virgo des are more metal rich by @xmath43 dex as compared to the  @xmath44   relation for local des by caldwell et al .",

    "( 1999 ) suggest that the principal difference between blue and redder lsbgs is the e - folding timescale for star formation .",
    "the general conclusion seems to be that lsbgs are gas rich and unevolved , both chemically and photometrically , which may be related to their low mass densities .    in view of their probably high space density and large gas mass fractions ,",
    "the lsbgs constitute an important fuel reservoir for star formation in the universe .",
    "gas in lsbgs can be made accessible to other galaxies e.g. in collisions .",

    "moreover , there have been suggestions that lsbgs may be responsible for some of the metal line absorption systems seen in qso spectra ( e.g. phillipps et al . 1993 ) .      despite their faintness , many lsbg contain hii regions and the metallicity of lsbgs have been investigated through the derivation of nebular oxygen abundances .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1994 ) used an empirical determination of the oxygen abundance to find values of  @xmath50log(o / h ) ranging from 7.3 to 8.8 , for individual hii regions with a strong peak around 8.4 .",

    "this together with small or non existent colour gradients ( rnnback & bergvall 1994 , de blok et al .",
    "1995 , patterson and thuan 1996 ) suggests that the stellar populations are spatially homogeneous in age and metallicity .",
    "this is supported also by recent near infrared surface photometry ( bergvall et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there is only a weak correlation between metallicity and absolute blue luminosity ( mcgaugh 1994 , and bergvall & rnnback 1994 ) , see however fig .",
    "metallicity and surface brightness are related in the sense that lsbgs have lower than average abundances for their absolute magnitudes as compared to high surface brightness galaxies . however , neither investigation found any strong correlation between surface brightness and oxygen abundance .",
    "some lsbgs have a too low surface brightness to be observable spectroscopically at the time of these studies .",
    "the new generation of 8 - 10 m class telescopes may be used to investigate if late type galaxies with extremely low surface brightness are even more metal - poor .",

    "the concept of `` compact galaxies '' was introduced by zwicky ( 1965 ) to denote galaxies barely distinguishable from stars on the palomar sky survey plates .",
    "originally , most studies of blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) concerned objects from the lists of compact / emission line / uv - excess galaxies produced by zwicky ( 1966 ) , haro ( 1956 ) and markarian ( 1967 )",
    ". however , only a fraction of the objects in these lists are bcgs , the others being agns , normal spirals with nuclear star formation , hii regions in the outskirts of nearby spirals etc .",
    "later , many apparently similar objects have been added , mostly from emission line surveys ( cf .",
    "this type of galaxy is sometimes also referred to as hii galaxies ( melnick et al .",
    "1985b , hazard 1986 , terlevich et al .",
    "1991 ) , since they have spectra reminiscent of galactic hii regions ( and were often discovered because of this property ) .",
    "other types include `` blue amorphous galaxies '' ( sandage and brucato 1979 , gallagher and hunter 1987 ) . different notation reflects a focus on different physical aspects meaning that the classifications do not necessary overlap completely , and this loosely classified group may contain objects with different evolutionary history . without arguing that any name is better than the other , we shall henceforth use the name bcgs , unless we want to draw attention to differences .",
    "since many bcgs have been discovered by means of objective prism surveys , which are not very sensitive to the properties of the host galaxy , `` ordinary '' dis with bright hii regions may `` contaminate ''",
    "samples selected in this way . note also that not all galaxies denoted as bcgs in the literature are strictly compact according to a surface brightness criterion .",
    "bcgs have luminosities in the range @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "those bcgs which are less luminous than @xmath60 are commonly referred to as blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) .",

    "6 a spectrum of one of them ( izw18 ) .",
    "the blue compact galaxies are the class of objects where most galaxies with low abundances as derived from hii regions have been found . the over - representation of bcgs is probably related to selection effects , since high surface brightness and prominent emission line spectra make it relatively easy to determine nebular abundances .",
    "early studies ( e.g. arp 1965 , zwicky 1966 ) hinted that bcgs had dramatically different properties compared to `` normal '' dwarf and giant galaxies .",
    "the wide interest in low metallicity bcgs was triggered by the work of sargent and searle ( 1970 ) and searle and sargent ( 1972 ) where they showed two bcgs to be metal - poor and forming stars at high rates .",
    "they concluded that either these galaxies were young , now forming their first generation of stars , or that star formation occurred in short bursts separated by long quiescent periods ( searle et al . 1973 ) .",
    "today the latter explanation seems the correct one for the majority of bcgs , if not all .",
    "bcgs are smallish galaxies with high central surface brightness .",
    "the detailed morphology and surface photometry of bcgs have been studied by many investigators .",
    "the central morphology is often irregular due to the presence of active star formation , but this contains very little information on the extended light distribution which likely traces the dominant stellar mass .",

    "kunth et al .",
    "( 1988 ) reached the similar conclusion that bcgs constituted a `` mixed bag '' of morphologies , including objects that appeared to be isolated extragalactic hii regions ( e.g. pox186 ) , irregular morphologies , as well as more common cases with symmetric outer envelopes suggesting the presence of an old population .",
    "salzer et al .",
    "( 1989b ) classified the emission line galaxies in the um survey according to morphology and emission line properties .",
    "telles et al .",
    "( 1997 ) divided hii galaxies into two classes : type i which have irregular morphology and are more luminous , while type ii have symmetric and regular outer structure .",
    "the existence of regular haloes , if corresponding to stellar emission , is in itself suggesting fairly high ages since relaxation times are of the order of a few times @xmath61 years . of course the stars may be younger if they formed later on in an already relaxed gaseous disc .",
    "quantitative surface photometry reaching faint isophotal levels began with the development of ccd detectors .",
    "bergvall ( 1985 ) found that eso  338-ig04 ( = tol1924416 ) followed an exponential like surface brightness distribution in the i - band , suggesting the presence of an old stellar disc .",
    "loose and thuan ( 1986b ) on the contrary found haro2 to follow a more elliptical like light distribution , with some suggestion of redder colours in the halo .",
    "similar results were obtained by kunth et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "the shape of surface brightness profiles in bcgs has been subject to some debate and both exponential and @xmath62 laws have been claimed to best match the data .",
    "papaderos et al .",
    "( 1996a ) have proposed that profiles in general can be fit with a three - component model , with an exponential light profile in the outer parts .",
    "exponential outer profiles were also found by telles and terlevich ( 1997 ) . on the other hand doublier",
    "( 1997 ) find @xmath62 profiles in a substantial fraction of objects , while the rest have exponential light profiles .",
    "we note however that these studies do not compare easily because only a few objects are in common . for most bcgs the shape of the profile",
    "changes with radius , meaning that the fitting shape will be uncertain and critically depend on the sensitivity limits .",
    "bergvall and stlin ( 1999 ) go deeper than other published studies ( to levels fainter than @xmath63 mag / arcsec@xmath46 ) , and claim that @xmath62 types laws are favoured when using deep red ( r or i band ) data , but that discs provide decent fits to the outer parts , and are favoured for b - band data .",
    "the shape of the luminosity profiles depends on how one constructs them , and especially the amount of central excess ( identified with the `` starburst '' component ) depends critically on the chosen method ( marlowe et al .",
    "several investigators have found high underlying surface brightness ( @xmath64 to @xmath65 mag / arcsec@xmath46 ) and short scale lengths in bcgs as compared to other dwarf galaxies ( papaderos et al .",
    "1996a , telles and terlevich 1997 , marlowe et al .",
    "bergvall and stlin ( 1999 ) find much lower central surface brightness values when using deeper data for a sample of luminous bcgs .",
    "thus there might be differences arising from the different nature of the objects , but also from different observational methodology .",
    "now , one can ask what meaning the shape of the luminosity profile really has ?",
    "most dis and lsbgs , and faint des , are well described by exponential like laws , while @xmath62 laws are found in ellipticals of high and low ( e.g. m32 ) luminosity .",
    "recently , jerjen and binggeli ( 1997 ) showed that brighter des gradually approach the luminosity profiles of ellipticals , although they never become as curved as @xmath62 . a systematic homogeneous survey at faint isophotal levels , including all known types of low luminosity galaxies would be illuminating and moreover useful in understanding relations between dwarfs . for an example , see fig .",
    "8 where we show a luminosity profile of izw18 .",
    "in general , the central parts of bcgs contain one or a few star forming knots ( often found to be composed of many individual bright star clusters ) , which may be identified with the `` starburst '' region . the central knots in most cases give rise to excess surface brightness . to quantify the strength of the starburst the excess light may be integrated and compared to the underlying galaxy light .",
    "this gives rather modest starbursts in most bcgs , amounting to a brightening with typically less than one magnitude in the blue ( marlowe et al .",
    "1999 , papaderos et al .",
    "given that it must have a low mass to light ratio , this suggests that the starburst contains only a minor fraction of the integrated stellar mass , and that the subsequent fading in luminosity will be very moderate .",
    "of course , some of these galaxies may already have passed their sfr peak and be in the process of fading .",
    "however , the amount of central excess depends on how luminosity profiles were constructed and to what depth the profiles are fitted , and moreover depends on an a priori assumption of the true shape of the underlying galaxy .",
    "if whatever creates the increased star formation does so , not only in the centre , but throughout the galaxy in question , the `` burst strength '' will be underestimated .",
    "colour profiles can here yield useful additional information .      to detect underlying old populations",
    "it is essential to reach faint isophotal levels , and moreover to take into account the possible contamination from gas ionised by uv - photons leaking out from the central starburst .",
    "thuan ( 1983 ) attempted to constrain the star formation histories by nir aperture photometry and concluded that bcgs were old .",
    "however , this was based on central colours and old models , and the data do no longer allow for an unambiguous conclusion .",
    "surface photometry or resolved star photometry would be the preferred method to investigate ages of bcgs . with modern detectors , it is feasible to make surface photometry of metal - poor bcgs at faint levels in the near ir .",
    "bergvall and stlin ( 1999 ) found a very clear signal in @xmath66 of old stars formed on rather short timescales in the haloes of some luminous bcgs , while e.g. @xmath67 remained inconclusive , illustrating the power of nir observations .",
    "loose and thuan ( 1986b ) and kunth et al . ( 1988 ) found @xmath68 colours to redden with increasing radius , suggesting the presence of underlying old populations .",
    "optical surface photometry has continued to unveil red haloes in most bcgs studied in detail ( papaderos et al .",
    "1996 , doublier et al . 1997,1999",
    "; marlowe et al . 1999 ) and telles and terlevich ( 1997 ) found the underlying colours to be consistent with those of blue lsbgs and amorphous galaxies .",
    "however ages and star formation histories are not yet well constrained , since model predictions are degenerate . in many cases ,",
    "the most influential parameter is the assumed shape of the star formation history which is what one wants to determine ultimately .",
    "depending on how deep the halo is to be probed , and what pass band is used , different ages are obtained for the underlying population , indicating that composite stellar populations are present , or that nebular emission contributes to the colours , or both . for an example of colour profiles revealing a redder halo , see fig .",
    "nevertheless , all these studies demonstrate that the majority of bcgs are not young .",
    "cases were no underlying populations have yet been found exist , but as more detailed studies are performed , old populations turn up in most young galaxy candidates , as e.g. in the previous young galaxy candidates pox186 ( kunth et al . 1988 ; doublier et al . 1999 ) and eso  400-g43 ( bergvall and jrster 1988 ; bergvall and stlin 1999 ) .      the present star formation process is another important aspect of bcgs , since they offer fine laboratories for studying vigorous star formation in metal - poor environments with relatively small extinction problems . the ongoing star formation has been studied by means of spectral synthesis of either integrated colours ( thuan 1983 , bergvall 1985 ) or spectral energy distributions ( lequeux 1981 , thuan 1986 , fanelli et al .",
    "1988 , etc . ) or both .",
    "this gives information on the current star formation event and in general short bursts are found to best match the data ( e.g. mas - hesse and kunth 1999 ) .",
    "however this does not exclude longer star formation episodes as the following example illustrates : if star formation propagates through a galaxy , but typically takes place in individual luminous short lived hii regions , from studying the most luminous hii region one might get the illusion to witness a sudden starburst event although the average sfr might have been continuous . with this in mind , we can use spectral synthesis to investigate the duration of individual star - forming events , the initial mass function ( imf ) , the stellar content ( e.g. wr stars ) , and other interesting properties .    that most bcgs are not necessarily efficient star formers was shown by sage et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who investigated the neutral and molecular gas , infrared and optical properties of a small sample of bcgs and dis .",
    "most galaxies were found to be not more efficient than normal spirals in forming stars , the star formation efficiencies being high only when compared to other dwarfs .",
    "however compact star clusters ( see below ) require high sfrs to be gravitationally bound and there are indeed bcgs which appear to be very efficient star formers , and true dwarf analogues of giant starbursts .",
    "detailed studies have revealed that star formation in bcgs and dwarf starbursts often take place in dense `` super star clusters '' ( e.g. ngc1569 , arp and sandage 1985 ; ngc1705 , melnick et al .",
    "super star clusters ( sscs ) are comparable in luminosity to r136 ( the central cluster of 30 doradus in the lmc ) , and are sometimes much more luminous .",
    "it has been proposed that these may be newly born globular clusters , although it is still quite uncertain whether they are massive enough and if they are gravitationally bound .",

    "it would be interesting to know to what extent it is a general feature of bgcs to reveal young star clusters when studied with enough spatial resolution . given that special conditions may be required for sscs to form , their presence and abundance can yield important insights into the starburst mechanism .",
    "similar objects are found in massive starbursts ( e.g. m82 , oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ) , merging galaxies ( e.g. the _ antennae _ , whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) , and in the circum - nuclear regions of giant barred spirals ( e.g. barth et al . 1995 ) . ho and filipenko ( 1996 ) managed to determine the velocity dispersion of sscs in ncg1569 and ngc1705 and showed that they have masses on the order of @xmath69 , comparable to old galactic gcs .",

    "moreover , young sscs may be used to investigate the recent evolution of the starburst because they represent true `` simple stellar populations '' ( coeval on a time scale of around one million year ) and should be chemically homogeneous . in the case of eso  338-ig04 it is clear from the age distribution of young sscs that the present burst has been active for at least 30 myrs ( stlin et al .",

    "( 1989 ) , cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 ) , meynet ( 1995 ) and schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) have discussed the dependence of the wr bump strength on the parameters that define the star - forming episodes ( metallicity , age , imf slope , etc . ) .",
    "the two most interesting properties of the wolf - rayet bump is its strong dependence on metallicity and the constraints it can impose on the age of the cluster . since the wr phenomenon is tightly coupled to the generation of strong stellar winds , its incidence decreases significantly with decreasing metallicity , so that at @xmath70 only very massive stars ( initial mass @xmath71 80 m@xmath72 ) might become wr stars .",
    "this small mass range implies that the detection of the wr bump in low metallicity galaxies can provide important information on the upper mass limit of the imf .",
    "the relative population of wr to o stars is usually measured through the @xmath73 ratio , the luminosity of the wr - bump over the @xmath74-luminosity . to compare with model predictions",
    "it is necessary to integrate over the whole ionised region which poses some observational technical problems .",
    "the measurements of this ratio might also be strongly affected by differential extinction .",
    "since @xmath75 is of stellar origin , it should be affected by the same extinction as the stellar continuum . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath76 is of nebular origin and might suffer from a larger amount of extinction . ignoring this effect may lead to a significant overestimation of the @xmath73 ratio .",
    "schmutz and vacca ( 1999 ) have questioned the use of the 4640  emission feature which may not entirely be due to wr stars but to large numbers of o stars or contamination from other nebular lines .",
    "observations show that very short bursts are compatible in general with a salpeter imf and a large upper mass cut - off .",
    "recent results by cervio ( 1998 ) show that if a significant fraction of massive stars are formed in binary systems , mass transfer episodes can lead to the formation of wr stars during longer periods of time than predicted by models based on the evolution of single stars alone .",
    "therefore , age calibrations through wr features has to be taken with caution .",
    "schaerer ( 1996 ) has evaluated the effect of the evolution of the wr stars population on the heii narrow emission line at 4686   , by combining model atmospheres accounting for stellar winds with evolutionary tracks .",
    "he concludes that for metallicities in the range @xmath77 to @xmath5 , a strong nebular heii emission line should originate in early wr phases when wc stars begin to appear . the heii emission line is indeed detected in a few objects with very young stellar populations , below 3  myr , and therefore starting to produce wr stars ( ngc  2363 and mrk  36 ) , in good agreement with the scenario proposed by schaerer .",
    "this is also supported by the detection of wr stars in izw18 ( that came as a surprise in view of its very low metallicity ) ( see fig 7 ; legrand et al .",
    ", 1997b , izotov et al .",

    "gordon and gottesman ( 1981 ) and thuan and martin ( 1981 ) conducted the first extensive systematic surveys of neutral hydrogen in bcgs , and in total more than 200 bcgs , predominantly in the northern hemisphere , were observed and the majority detected .",

    "( 1998c ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of bcgs seems to have hi companions ( taylor 1997 ) , probably representing uncatalogued gas rich lsbgs .",
    "there is a current view suggesting that the formation of stars depends primarily on the amount of molecular gas .",
    "however the situation in low metallicity gas is still under debate .",
    "many attempts to detect co in bcgs galaxies have been reported so far ( combes 1986 , young et al .",
    "1986 , arnault et al .",
    "1988 , sage et al .",
    "1992 , israel et al .",
    "1995 , gondhalekar et al . 1998 )",
    "but the co luminosity of bcgs is very low , in comparison with their observed star formation rate , mostly yielding only upper limits .",
    "this lack of detection may be because the low metallicity of bcgs hides the true molecular phase by a low co to h@xmath16 conversion factor .",
    "however other explanations may be invoked as well : the co excitation could be lower than for molecular clouds in our galaxy , or the molecular clouds in bcgs could be uv - photodissociated as a result of high star formation rates .",
    "gondhalekar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that the co luminosity correlates rather weakly with the fir luminosity , i.e. fir luminosity may not be a good tracer of molecular gas .",
    "obviously the lack of co detection does not preclude the presence of h@xmath16 molecules in these gas - rich galaxies .",
    "in fact there are mechanisms by which molecular hydrogen can be formed in absence of grains from hydrogen atoms in gaseous phase via a reaction involving negative hydrogen ions ( lequeux and viallefond 1980 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that in star - forming galaxies with well localised massive star formation surrounded by huge hi gaseous envelopes that the molecular hydrogen is abundant and makes up a significant fraction of the dark matter dynamically detected ( lequeux and viallefond 1980 , lo et al .",
    "new capabilities such as the fuse mission will offer the unique possibility to detect for the first time cold h@xmath16 in absorption against the stellar continuum of blue massive stellar clusters .",
    "izw18 will be the first target to be searched for h@xmath16 .",

    "( 1999a , b ) investigated the h@xmath0 velocity fields of a sample of luminous bcgs utilising scanning fabry - perot interferometry .",
    "the velocity fields were found to be complex , and in many cases showed evidence for dynamically distinct components , e.g. counter rotating features .",
    "their analysis suggests that mergers involving gas rich dwarfs are the best explanations for the starbursts in these systems .",
    "masses were modelled both dynamically and photometrically , and some galaxies showed apparent rotational mass deficiencies which could be explained if the studied bcgs are not primarily supported by rotation , if stars and gas are dynamically decoupled ( e.g. due to gas flows ) or if the galaxies are not in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "there are also indications that the width of emission lines in bcgs is related to virial motions and may provide dynamical mass estimates ( see sect .",
    "7.1 , and melnick et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "flows in the ionised gas have been detected in several bcgs ( marlowe et al . 1995 ; martin 1996 , 1998 ; meurer et al .",
    "1997 ) , and suggested by x - ray observations in viizw403 ( papaderos et al .",
    "flows have also been found from studies of the ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "although ly@xmath0 emission in starbursts is expected to be strong , it turns out that dust is very effective in suppressing this line because the effects of resonant scattering in a gas - rich medium dramatically reduce the effective mean free path of the ly@xmath0 photons . on the other hand",
    "this mechanism does not explain why in many galaxies with little dust content such as izw18 ( kunth et al .",
    "1994 ) ly@xmath0 is seen in absorption whereas in dustier ones such as haro2 ( lequeux et al .",
    "1995 ) the line is seen in emission but with a clear p - cygni profile .",
    "kunth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the strength of ly@xmath0 emission is in fact only weakly correlated with metallicity and suggested that the dynamical state of ism is also a major regulating mechanism .",
    "a new model explains ly@xmath0 profiles in starburst galaxies by the hydrodynamics of superbubbles powered by massive stars ( tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "searle and sargent ( 1972 ) had already speculated on the reasons for a sudden increase of the star formation rate in bcgs , followed by long quiescent phases .",
    "the regulation of their star formation histories in general , is of course a very important question , intimately linking to the physical relations between bcgs and other dwarfs , which will be addressed in sect .",
    "moreover , given the heterogeneity of bcgs as a class the possibility that different mechanisms operate is not excluded .",
    "the star formation rate in bcgs ( even the mass averaged value , cf .",
    "3.2 ) varies considerably , and some are rather star forming dwarfs than starburst ones . given the increased central hi densities ( van zee et al .",
    "1998c ) it is evident that some mechanism that can concentrate gas in the centres is needed .",
    "a scenario with statistical fluctuations proposed by searle et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , has been further elaborated by gerola et al .",
    "the basic ingredients are a positive feedback of star formation which in combination with the small masses of bcgs give rise to large fluctuations in the sfrs .",
    "a popular explanation is that supernova driven winds halt star formation by expelling the gas .",
    "later , the lost gas might accrete back on the galaxy and create a new starburst ( tayler 1975 , dekel and silk 1986 , silk et al . 1987 , babul and rees 1992 ) . a problem with models where the precursor accretes gas continuously is the time scale for onset of rapid star formation ,",
    " why would the galaxy wait to form stars for a long time , then suddenly ( on time scales of the order of @xmath79 years ) burst into an unsustainable star formation rate ?    it is well known that mergers between giant galaxies can produce impressive starbursts ( sanders et al . 1988 ) , and it is possible that mergers are key mechanism in building up the galaxy population and regulating starburst activity ( lacey et al .",
    "therefore this possibility is attractive also for explaining dwarf starbursts , i.e. bcgs .",
    "it is evident that there are at least a few bcgs that seem to be interacting / merging in some form ( e.g. iizw40 , he2 - 10 , and galaxies in stlin et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "moreover , many of these bcgs show super star clusters ( sscs ) of the same kind as those found in giant mergers .",
    "on the other hand several studies indicate that many bcgs are pretty isolated ( cf .",
    ". however there might be low surface brightness or pure hi companions missing in present catalogues .",
    "a related question is whether tidal interactions are strong enough to ignite bursts in dwarfs that , like bcgs ( salzer 1989 ) are not accompanied by giant galaxies .",
    "first , tidal forces between dwarfs are too modest to trigger radial gas flows unless the galaxies are almost in contact ( campos - aguilar et al .",
    "moreover it is uncertain whether dwarfs are at all unstable against tidal perturbations ( mihos et al .",
    "perhaps a direct contact is needed to trigger dwarf starburst explaining why pairs are rare since one would only pick up the burst once the merger is already in progress . while mergers would be sufficient for producing bcgs it is uncertain how common they are .",
    "the environments of isolated bcgs should be studied in more detail for this purpose .",
    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) include galaxies with the lowest measured abundances as derived from hii regions .",
    "since both bcgs and dis in general possess bright hii regions , many investigations of nebular abundances deal with objects of both classes , which in any case are not always very distinct .",
    "very little is known about the metallicity of the stellar population of bcgs .",
    "schulte - ladbeck et al . ( 1999 ) , using a colour magnitude diagram , derive [ fe / h]@xmath80 for the old population in viizw403 , one of the most nearby bcgs , which has a previously reported oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h ) @xmath81 ( tully et al .",

    "the metallicity of bcgs was first addressed by searle and sargent ( 1972 ) , who showed that the abundances of oxygen and neon in i  zw18 and ii  zw40 were sub - solar .",
    "their work has been followed by numerous investigations over the years which have established their nature as metal - poor galaxies , as regards oxygen : alloin et al .",

    "the abundances of heavy elements in these objects range between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , making them among the least chemically evolved objects in the universe .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution for oxygen abundance among hii galaxies .",
    "oxygen is assumed to be representative of the total metallicity of the entire galaxy , although claims have been reported that this may only concern the hii region because of incomplete mixing ( kunth and sargent 1986 , kunth et al .",
    "1994 , roy and kunth 1995 , see sect .",
    "figure 3 reveals that the oxygen abundance in this class of objects peaks slightly above 1/10 of the solar value .",
    "this peak may be related to selection effects since many surveys have selected galaxies with strong forbidden oxygen emission lines , which happen to be strongest for an oxygen abundance of around ten percent of the solar value .",
    "there is indeed another strong selection bias in fig .",
    "3 because it includes only galaxies with `` measurable '' electron temperatures ( through the use of [ oiii]@xmath844363 ) hence restricts the sample to abundances lower than 12+log[o / h ] @xmath85 .",
    "the apparent low abundance cut - off is bounded by izw18 ( sect .",
    "the utter lack of known galaxies with abundances smaller than izw18 , despite concentrated observational efforts ( see sect .",
    "6 ) has been a puzzle .",
    "kunth and sargent ( 1986 ) suggested that izw18 could indeed be a primordial galaxy in which the observed hii regions have been self - enriched in the current burst .",
    "this idea has been tested by several distinct approaches , but we will see ( sect .",
    "5.1.2 ) that there are many indications that izw18 is in fact old .    according to izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) , nine bcgs more metal - poor than 1/20 of solar exists .",

    "the investigation of carbon abundances in the hii gas poses some difficulties since there are no strong emission lines in the optical regions .",

    "garnett et al . (",
    "1995 ) presents c / o ratios for seven galaxies , including some bcgs , and three others are presented by kobulnicky and skillman ( 1998 ) .",
    "thus carbon abundances are still not very well explored in bcgs .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1995 ) found that c / o increases with increasing oxygen abundance .",
    "the average value of this ratio is rather low , as compared to solar , except possibly for izw18 which has c / o about a factor of two larger than predicted from stellar nucleosynthesis ( garnett et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the relative abundance of nitrogen to oxygen increases with o / h ( pagel and edmunds 1981 , serrano and peimbert 1983 , torres - peimbert et al .",
    "1989 ) , implying a secondary origin of n in the cno cycle .",
    "such a behaviour was not seen at very low o / h ( lequeux et al . 1979 ; kunth and sargent 1983 ; campbell et al .",
    "1986 ) indicating that nitrogen is mainly a primary element in very metal - poor gas .",
    "the current interpretation of this behaviour from stellar nucleosynthesis models is that intermediate stars produce primary nitrogen by hot - bottom burning .",
    "in such a phase , the third dredge - up brings carbon - rich material from the core onto the hydrogen burning shell ( renzini and voli 1981 ; van der hoek and groenewegen 1997 ) .",
    "the scatter of the n / o versus o / h diagram has been considered as larger than the observational uncertainties ( although they were nearly comparable two decades ago ) .",
    "time delays between the production of oxygen due to massive stars and that of nitrogen is likely part of the explanation although this point of view has been challenged by recent data from izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) . indeed their high signal to noise observations not only suggest a small intrinsic dispersion of log n / o ( @xmath89 dex ) at low metallicities but a similar behaviour is found for c / o and other ratios , see fig .",
    "the disagreement with garnett et al .",
    "( 1995,1997 ) comes mainly from the reassessment of c / o in izw18 , the abundances of which are thoroughly discussed in sect .",
    "izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) find positive correlations between c / o and n / o with o / h but for 12+log(o / h ) @xmath90 , c / o and n / o remain constant and independent of o / h .",
    "they conclude that galaxies with such low abundances are genuinely young ( less than 40 myr old ) , now making their first generation of stars .",
    "moreover they suggest that all galaxies with 7.6 @xmath91 12+log(o / h ) @xmath91 8.2 have ages from 100 to 500 myr .",
    "thus , the question raised by searle and sargent almost 30 years ago would after all have a positive answer . however , there are independent data suggesting that these galaxies do in fact contain old stars ( see sect . 5 ) . moreover , there are definitely many bcgs with @xmath92 which have been convincingly shown to be much older than 500 myr , e.g. eso  338-ig04 from its globular clusters ( stlin et al .",
    "moreover , as we shall discuss below , there are alternative interpretations of the abundance patterns which do not require the galaxies to be young .",
    "hii regions in the outskirts of spiral galaxies may have c / o values as low as those of the most metal - poor galaxies , and hii regions in spiral galaxies follow the same c / o vs. o / h relation as dwarf galaxies ( garnett et al .",
    "this suggests that they evolve chemically in the same manner .",
    "now , the discs of spiral galaxies are several gyr old , still the c / o ratio is as low as in the most metal - poor bcgs , clearly indicating that c / o is not simply a function of age .",
    "the observed trend of c / o vs. o / h could equally well be explained by a metallicity dependent yield ( maeder 1992 ) .",
    "gustafsson et al . ( 1999 ) studied the carbon abundances of disc stars in our galaxy and concluded that the observed relation could be explained if carbon production occurs mainly in massive wr(wc ) stars . in this scenario , c /",
    "o would be mainly a function of metallicity and not age .",
    "a similar pattern is seen for n / o observations of hii regions in spirals .",
    "outlying hii regions appear to have n / o similar to the most metal - poor galaxies ( van zee et al .",
    "moreover , the low surface brightness galaxies studied by rnnback & bergvall ( 1995 ) and which are fairly old systems ( bergvall et al .",
    "1999 ) , have n / o comparable to those of the most metal - poor bcgs . pilyugin ( 1999 ) finds that if significant n production occurs in intermediate mass stars , and the heavy element abundances have not been polluted by the present star formation event ( i.e. the time scale for cooling of fresh metals is longer than the typical lifetime of a giant hii region ) the constant n / o found at low metallicity is consistent with the presence of previous starbursts , i.e. high ages .",
    "it is also worth commenting that if the time scale for recycling is longer than the duration of a typical burst of star formation , this can explain the lack of abundance gradients in dwarfs ( sect .",
    "the elements ne , si , s and ar all shows a constant abundance relative to oxygen , independent of o / h as expected from stellar nucleosynthesis , since they are products of @xmath0-processes ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "finally the fe / o abundance ratio in bcgs is on average 2.5 times smaller than in the sun with a mean [ o / fe]@xmath93 with no dependence on oxygen abundance ( izotov and thuan 1999 ) .",
    "the scatter is surprisingly small considering the short time scale for the production of oxygen as compared to iron production because different stellar masses are involved .",
    "if real , it would imply that fe could have been produced by explosive nucleosynthesis of sne type ii for both o and fe at the early stage of chemically unevolved galaxies .",
    "in summary we find that the study of heavy elements in bcgs shows that these systems are chemically unevolved but does not allow to infer a young age in terms of galaxy formation . in the range 7.1 @xmath94 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath94 8.3 more than 100 objects have good quality data .",
    "alpha - elements ( ne , si , s and ar ) have abundances relative to oxygen that show no dependence on oxygen abundance and are close to solar values and similar to that in halo stars and distant galaxies . at low metallicities ,",
    "c / o is constant , independently of the oxygen abundance but more metal deficient galaxies should be observed to confirm the presence or absence of a trend .",
    "the behaviour of n / o indicates a primary origin as anticipated already by several investigators ( see matteucci 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the conclusion that n , c , fe and o are produced only by massive stars in the most metal - poor systems ( izotov and thuan 1999 ) needs to be checked by independent observers with larger samples .",
    "there is a possibility that metals observed in the most metal - poor galaxies originate from previous population iii star enrichments , previous bursts or continuous star formation at very low rate . in this case",
    "the minimum metallicity should be increasing with time , consistent with quasar absorption line data ( lu et al .",
    "1996 ) , although admittedly the connection to dwarfs is not clear .",
    "the question of young galaxies has to be further addressed before it can be settled , but as we have seen , most bcgs ( including objects with less than 1/10 solar metallicity ) are definitely not young .",
    "even the best candidates i  zw18 and sbs  0335 - 052 seems to be old although izotov , thuan and their collaborators still dispute this .    while abundances and abundance ratios are the footprints of the past chemical evolution , many factors need to be taken into account to unveil the enrichment history and chemistry alone is of limited value in constraining the history of galaxies .",
    "still , the set of data presented by izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) is probably unique with respect to data quality , homogeneity and the large number of atomic species included , making it a most valuable tool .",
    "zwicky ( 1956 ) proposed that dwarf galaxies could be formed from debris when large galaxies collide , an idea that was further addressed by schweizer ( 1978 ) .",
    "though not a real morphological class of its own , this group of galaxies have a common history which is likely to have a considerable impact on their chemical composition .",
    "if dwarfs can form from material originating in giant galaxies we would expect them to be comparatively metal rich for a given luminosity .",
    "some recent progress in this field ( mirabel et al .",
    "1992 , duc & mirabel 1994 , 1998 ) suggests that , even though the final fate of dwarf galaxoids forming in mergers is uncertain , they have metallicities that are systematically higher than in other dwarfs of similar luminosity .",
    "tidal dwarfs thus appear to be a fundamentally distinct class of galaxies .",
    "moreover , their future evolution is uncertain : are they stable , do they contain dark matter , how will they be affected by future interactions with their parent galaxy ?    in rich clusters , where interactions should have been frequent , explaining the presence of cd galaxies and the overabundance of ellipticals , we would expect a larger fraction of tidal dwarfs .",
    "if they can survive and escape their progenitor , dwarfs in clusters must be more metal rich than field dwarfs .",
    "there are preliminary indications that this may be the case ( as well as indications that it is not , cf .",
    "sect . 4.1.1 . ) . of course",
    ", galaxies may simply evolve faster in high density environments .",
    "interactions with other galaxies and the intercluster medium may stimulate star formation in dwarfs and make the chemical evolution clock run faster .    in view of their chemical abundances , it is not likely that the local dwarfs have formed this way .",
    "but what if this process occurred early in the universe , at high redshifts when the parent galaxies were not yet significantly enriched ?",
    "the blue compact galaxy izw18 ( also known as markarian 116 ) was first described by zwicky in 1966 .",
    "izw18 is the galaxy with the lowest known metallicity as derived from the ionised gaseous component .",
    "its oxygen abundance is only @xmath121/50 of that of the sun .",
    "thus , often being referred to as `` the most metal - poor galaxy known '' , it is still two orders of magnitude more metal rich than the most metal - poor stars in the milky way .",
    "it is intriguing that while izw18 was the first bcg ( together with ii  zw40 ) in which ionised gas abundances were investigated ( searle & sargent 1972 ) , it remains still the most metal - poor bcg known , despite large efforts in searching for more metal - poor ones .",

    "the oxygen abundance seems to be constant , within the errors , over the optical face of the galaxy ( e.g. skillman and kennicutt 1993 , vilchez and iglesias - pramo 1998 , legrand et al . 1999 ) .",
    "c / o was first derived by dufour et al .",
    "( 1988 ) who found [ c / o]@xmath97   from iue and ground based optical observations , an unexpectedly high value : higher than [ c / o ] in dwarfs like the lmc , indicating that the chemistry in izw18 is anomalous .",

    "garnett et al . ( 1995 ) used the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on hst but only got a lower limit [ c / o ] @xmath99 .",
    "later , they re - observed izw18 with the fos and found [ c / o]@xmath100 and @xmath101 for the north - west ( nw ) and south - east ( se ) regions respectively ( garnett et al . 1997 )",
    ". these values are again rather high when compared to other metal - poor dwarfs and garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed that a carbon enrichment from an intermediate age population had occurred previous to the current star formation burst .",
    "recently , izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) reanalysed the hst data by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , now finding [ c / o]@xmath102 and @xmath103 for the nw and se regions respectively .",
    "their lower c / o follows mainly from a higher adopted electron temperature based on new ground based spectra .",
    "izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) also found indications of a temperature gradient , giving rise to the apparent abundance difference between the nw and se components .",
    "these last [ c / o ] values for izw18 follow nicely the trend for other very metal - poor galaxies ( see fig .",
    "however , the fact that the [ c / o ] determination has changed so much with time is of course not satisfying . hence the new value adopted by izotov and thuan ( 1999 )",
    "should perhaps not be taken at face value since part of their disagreement with other authors might be associated with the imperfect match between hst and ground based apertures . a deep hst uv+optical spectrum with a single instrument like stis",
    "could resolve this issue .",
    "similar problems were encountered with the study of the nitrogen to oxygen ratio in izw18 that first yielded lower limits until dufour et al .",
    "( 1988 ) were able to derive [ n / o]@xmath104 .",
    "izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) recently derived a lower [ n / o ] of @xmath105 in perfect agreement with their overall trend that [ n / o ] stays constant at low [ o / h ] in metal - poor galaxies , contrary to previous findings ( see fig .",
    "the helium abundance of izw18 has been a concern for some time .",
    "its value is of special importance for deriving the primordial helium abundance , since izw18 has the lowest known ism heavy element abundance of galaxies .",
    "searle and sargent ( 1972 ) found a rather normal he abundance , that later was revised down , e.g. @xmath106 ( davidson and kinman 1985 ) , and @xmath107 ( pagel et al . 1992 ) .",
    "these values were rather low in view of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) theory .",
    "izotov and thuan ( 1998a , b ) find @xmath108 , in comfortable agreement with sbbn .",
    "kunth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) attempted to measure the oxygen abundance in the neutral gas cloud surrounding izw18 by using uv absorption lines , observed with the ghrs onboard hst .",
    "they found that the oxygen abundance could be as low as 1/1000 of the solar value , indicating near pristine gas with abundances lower than what is found in qso absorption line systems .",
    "however the use of saturated lines was criticised by pettini and lipman ( 1995 ) .",
    "van zee et al . (",
    "1998 ) argue that the hi velocity dispersion together with the measured oi line of kunth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) imply an oxygen abundance  @xmath1091/60 of the solar value , suggesting that the chemical enrichment products are well mixed .",
    "izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) come to the conclusion that all galaxies with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath94 7.6 must be younger than 40 myr , thus in practise newly born galaxies ; and this would be very much so for izw18 with its record low abundance ( 12+log(o / h)=7.18 ) .",
    "there are however other possible interpretations of the abundance ratios of metal - poor galaxies ( as we already pointed out in sect .",
    "moreover there is some independent evidence suggesting that izw18 does indeed host an old underlying population .",
    "the age of izw18 has been debated ever since the early seventies when the intriguing properties of this galaxy were first realised .",
    "being the most metal - poor galaxy , it is of course one of the most promising candidates for a genuinely young galaxy . the absence of an outer regular envelope made izw18 a good young galaxy candidate .",
    "thuan ( 1983 ) argued from near infrared aperture photometry that the galaxy was old , but comparing his colours with the recent bruzual and charlot ( 2000 ) leads to a different conclusion .",
    "moreover the apertures only cover the central part of the galaxy which is dominated by young stars irrespective of the possible presence of an underlying population .",
    "pantelaki and clayton ( 1987 ) claimed a high age for izw18 based on the observed c / o and n / o ratios , but these were later revised downwards .",
    "a similar argument was given by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from their new c abundance , that however was revised downwards recently by izotov and thuan ( 1999 ) weakening the conclusion .",
    "in view of the uncertainties on the n / o and c / o ratios and yields , and that these ratios are subtle to interpret anyway , it is clear that they give very limited constraints on the star formation history in izw18 .",
    "the chemical evolution model used by kunth et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the spectro - chemical evolution model of legrand ( 1998 ) also suggest that izw18 is not young .",
    "the latter one predicts that izw18 could have experienced a low but continuous star formation rate for several gyr prior to the present burst .",
    "of course the difficulties outlined in sect .",
    "3 make all constraints on galaxy ages derived from chemistry very uncertain .",
    "izw18 has been imaged in the optical by hst by two different groups ( hunter and thronson 1995 ; dufour et al .",
    "1996 ) , both finding a resolved population of young massive stars .",
    "there was no evidence for old stars , but none against , since the observations were not sufficiently deep to allow old stars to be detected .",
    "these data sets were recently reanalysed by aloisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and give support for an age in excess of 0.5 gyr .",
    "stlin ( 1999a ) studied the resolved stellar population in the near infrared with nicmos onboard hst , and found that while the nir colour magnitude diagram was dominated by stars 10 - 20 myr old , numerous red agb stars require a much higher age in agreement with aloisi et al .",
    "the nicmos data require stars older than 1 gyr to be present , and an age as high as 5 gyr is favoured .",
    "this holds even if a distance slightly higher than the customary 10 mpc is adopted .    in fig .",
    "8 we show surface brightness and colour ( @xmath68 and @xmath110 ) profiles of izw18 from deep ccd images obtained at the nordic optical telescope and infrared images from the ukirt ( stlin 1999c ) .",
    "the colours rise continuously with increasing radius and reach @xmath111 ( cousins r ) and @xmath112 at a radius of 10 arcseconds .",
    "if due to purely stellar emission , a single stellar population model with a metallicity of @xmath113 ( bruzual and charlot 2000 ) indicates an age of @xmath114 for both colours , irrespective of imf ( salpeter , scalo or miller - scalo ) . with a more realistic assumption of a more or less continuous star formation rate ( e.g. for an exponentially decaying sfr with e - folding time @xmath115 gyr )",
    "we predict an age of at least 5 gyr .",
    "one possible caveat is that there might be a substantial contribution from ionised gas to the colours , but we believe that this is not a dominant effect .",
    "the b - band profile has an exponential shape for radii greater than 10 arcseconds ; fitting a disc to the outer parts yields a central surface brightness of @xmath116 mag / arcsec@xmath46 and an integrated disc luminosity @xmath117 . with a mass to light ratio for a @xmath118 years old single stellar population",
    ", the disc luminosity is equivalent to a stellar mass of @xmath119 , but may be a factor of two higher if the sfr has been continuous ( cf . the predictions by legrand 1998 ) .",
    "with a mass of the young population of @xmath120 this means that while difficult to detect , the old population dominates the stellar mass .",
    "this suggests that izw18 could be hosted by a low surface brightness galaxy .",
    "thus , although not foolproof , photometry ( of individual stars and surface photometry ) now indicates that the galaxy is in fact old , although izotov et al .",
    "( 1999a ) in a last attempt to resurrect its youth , suggested that the distance of izw18 has been severely underestimated .",
    "zwicky noted what he called a `` flare '' at the north west of izw18 , which has turned out to be a separate galaxy .",
    "h@xmath0 images showed nebulosity close to the centre of this putative companion galaxy ( fig .",
    "5 ) , suggesting that it had the same redshift as izw18 ( dufour and hester 1990 , stlin et al .",
    "this was later confirmed by spectroscopy ( petrosian et al .",
    "1996 , dufour et al .",
    "1996 ) . the hst imaging study by dufour et al .",

    "it is located in the same hi cloud as izw18 and its location coincides with a peak in the hi column density ( van zee et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "in view of its position , just a kpc away from izw18 , its chemical composition would be of considerable interest .",
    "this galaxy is fainter than izw18 but still very blue .",
    "however spectra have failed to unambiguously detect any oxygen lines , and consequently its metallicity is not known .",
    "the problem is that the galaxy has very low central surface brightness ( @xmath121 mag / arcsec@xmath46 , stlin 1999c ) making spectroscopy difficult .      for a long time",
    "i  zw18 seemed to play in its own league , with no other bcg coming really close to its low oxygen abundance in the hii - gas .",
    "however the entrance of sbs0335 - 052 on the stage changed the situation .",
    "this galaxy was found in the second byurakan survey ( sbs , markarian and stepanian 1983 ) .",
    "a number of papers from 1990 and onwards have shown it to be a galaxy with an oxygen abundance comparable to that of izw18 ( izotov et al .",
    "1990 , 1997b ; melnick et al .",

    "1997 ) is shown in fig . 9 and",
    "reveals a complex morphology . like izw18 ,",
    "sbs0335 - 052 has a faint companion galaxy ( sect .",
    "5.2.1 ) .",
    "there have been several claims that this galaxy is a truly young galaxy , not containing any underlying old population , ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 , izotov et al .",
    "1997b , papaderos et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the argument put forward is the low metallicity and the lack of any underlying population in surface photometric data .",
    "however lipovetsky et al . ( 1999 ) in their study of the companion , present also surface photometry of sbs0335 - 052 .",
    "the @xmath123 colours at a radius of 10 arcseconds is @xmath124 which indicates an age of several gyr for a single stellar population model with metallicity 2% solar and a standard salpeter imf ( bruzual and charlot 2000 ) .",
    "nebular gas contamination can not account for this , since that would make @xmath123 bluer , leading to an underestimate of the age . even allowing for an internal extinction of @xmath125 an age of 1 gyr or more is required .",
    "changing imf , or metallicity ( to 20% solar ) still leads to an age in excess of 1 gyr . relaxing the assumption of instantaneous star formation , and allowing for more realistic sfhs would increase the age to",
    "around 10 gyr ( for @xmath126 gyr , cf .",
    "thus , in view of the surface photometry presented by lipovetsky et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the age of  @xmath127 gyr can be regarded as a conservative lower limit .",
    "moreover the presence of red star clusters ( stlin 1999b ) suggests an age of several gyr .",
    "these star clusters were discussed by papaderos et al .",
    "( 1998 ) but the models they used to interpret the ages do not agree with other published models , but are systematically off - set , apparently leading to an underestimate of the age of the clusters .",
    "thus , sbs0335 - 052 , like izw18 , is probably not a genuinely young galaxy . in some sense sbs  0335 - 052",
    "is more extreme than izw18 in that despite being almost as metal - poor as izw18 , it is more luminous ( @xmath128 ) and thus lies further off the metallicity  luminosity relation for dis , see fig .",
    "10 .      like izw18 ,",
    "sbs  0335 - 052 also has a physical companion , sbs  0335 - 052w at a projected distance of 22 kpc ( pustilnik et al .",
    "lipovetsky et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h)=7.2 , even lower than that of sbs  0335 - 052 , and fully comparable to izw18 .",
    "this companion , though blue is not very compact and it has evidently avoided inclusion in any bcg catalogue . its central r surface brightness and",
    "sfr is rather low , comparable to a `` normal '' di .",
    "the fact that both sbs0335 - 052 and its companion resides in the same hi cloud but at least 22 kpc apart , poses a problem for the youth hypothesis since it would require a coordinated ignition of star formation in the two clouds .",
    "the most metal - poor bcgs : izw18 and sbs0335 - 052 ( and its companion ) , are probably not young galaxies .",
    "nevertheless they are important laboratories for studying star formation at low abundances and the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the metallicities of their old stellar populations can not be assessed with any accuracy .",
    "there is nothing that requires these galaxies to be more metal - poor than the most extreme dsph galaxies which have [ fe / h ] @xmath129 , see table 2 ( their oxygen abundances are still not known ) .",
    "in addition to these galaxies , there are more than a dozen other bcgs with abundance 12+log(o / h)@xmath130 or lower , and more objects are about to be discovered ( cf . sect .",
    "the local group , and its immediate surroundings , contains another half dozen di with very low metallicity .",
    "moreover there are many de / dsph galaxies in the neighbourhood with [ fe / h ] @xmath131 .",
    "in addition , lsbgs have proven a good hunting ground for very metal poor galaxies . in table 3 below we present all known galaxies with 12+log(o / h)@xmath130 or lower .",
    "when several measurements ( representing different hii regions ) for the same galaxy were available we took weighted linear averages ; and the same was done if there were differing o / h determinations of similar quality in the litterature ( in these cases , only galaxies for which the weighted average was lower than the limit were included in the table ) .",
    "these galaxies , taken together form an important , yet hardly homogeneous , set of data for investigating dwarf galaxy evolution .",

    "he identified a number of compact galaxies with strong emission lines .",

    "the underlying assumption was completely opposite however since v.a .",
    "ambartsumian had the view that galaxy nuclei originated from explosive events .",
    "many metal - poor galaxies known at present undergo enhanced star formation event .",
    "this type of activity has obviously favoured their discovery ( a metal - poor galaxy not necessarily needs to be an active one ! ) . following the early discovery of two bona fide metal - poor galaxies by searle and sargent ( 1972 ) that indeed turned out to experience an active star formation episode many astronomers have embarked in the building of large samples of such objects .",
    "surveays were aimed to study their statistical importance in the universe as a function of time , their relation to large structures and their contribution to the luminosity function .",
    "one way to select star - forming galaxies is to rely on their ultraviolet excess and emission line spectrum .",
    "this property is not completely unambiguous since it is shared to some extent by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "there are complications of course , mainly because of the effect of dust that reduces the uv flux and re - radiate the lyman continuum photons in the far infrared ( ir excess in iras 60 micron band ) .",
    "follow - up observations need to distinguish the full population of starbursts from the agn with non thermal activity .",
    "ground - based surveys have used morphological criteria , colour selection and emission line selection .",

    "spectroscopic follow ups have revealed a large proportion of hii galaxies and agns ( kunth et al .",
    "1981 )    the colour selection proceeds by searching for blue or ultraviolet excess objects involving various techniques such as the use of very low dispersed images or multiple colour direct images .",
    "dispersed images have been used by the first and second byurakan surveys ( fbs , sbs ) by markarian ( 1967 ) on iiaf emulsion and later the university michigan survey ( um , macalpine et al .",
    "1977 ) and case survey ( pesch and sanduleak 1983 ) with iiiaj emulsion . the second method has been pioneered by haro ( 1956 ) and extensively developed by the kiso observatory survey ( takase and miyauchi - isobe 1984 ) .",
    "low resolution slitless spectroscopy enables to detect [ oii]@xmath13 , h@xmath15 , [ oiii]@xmath14 and h@xmath0 lines depending on the chosen emulsion or filter .",
    "good seeing and excellent guiding are a requisite to avoid trailing and loss in detectivity .",
    "these techniques face a trade off between the dispersion and the spectral range covered .",
    "the higher the dispersion , the easier it becomes to detect weak emission lines against the continuum , while a narrow spectral range cuts significantly the sky background at the expense of the redshift range .",
    "the recent surveys discussed in gallego et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and salzer ( 1999 ) use the h@xmath0 line which can be bright even in low - excitation or very metal - poor objects .",

    "the most difficult problem that these surveys have to face is that of the follow - up observations ( terlevich et al .",
    "getting even a rough oxygen abundance for faint galaxies requires long telescope time and suggests the use of multi - object - spectroscopy .",
    "selection effects have to be considered in comparing objects drawn from different surveys and for the derivation of a luminosity function , as first pointed out by wasilewski ( 1983 ) and summarized by comte ( 1998 ) , who noted that selected populations have different statistical properties that depend on their selection modes .",

    "( 1997a ) pointed out that very blue objects selected from their emission lines were also missed by the markarian surveys .",

    "only metal - poor galaxies with metallicity of the order of 0.1 solar that undergo starbursts are easy to pick out just because oxygen is the major cooling species , hence the [ oiii ] lines at 4959 and 5007   are particularly strong . but as one moves to more deficient objects , say below 0.01 solar , forbidden lines fade and the dominant cooling agents are h and he ( kunth and sargent 1986).therefore a combination of h@xmath0 objective - prism spectroscopy and uv - excess searches should be promising .",
    "comte ( 1998 ) suggests a mid - uv imaging survey from balloon borne or orbiting instruments .",
    "so far the sbs and um surveys has given a handful of new galaxies but never with metallicity below 1/50 solar .",
    "why this is so",
    "? it may be that extreme metal - poor star - forming galaxies are very rare or do not exist locally      because it was observationally difficult to confirm the recurrent burst picture against the idea that blue compact dwarf galaxies are young , several hi surveys have provided independent clues . in their decisive early hi survey ,",
    "lo and sargent ( 1979 ) showed that the space density of protogalactic clouds required by the youth hypothesis must be at least 8 mpc@xmath154 , each cloud having a mass of about @xmath155 which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than what they found .",
    "hi - selected sample of clouds unavoidably turn out to have optical counterparts . in all cases ,",

    "1995 ) but they are likely to be associated with ( or bridge ) nearby large visible galaxies .",
    "tyson and scalo ( 1988 ) have suggested that the majority of dwarf galaxies may be in a quiescent state , not forming young stars , and that they might consequently be missed by optical selection methods .",
    "a recent analysis of hi - selected galaxies ( szomoru et al . 1994 ) shows that hi searches do not yield a population of optically underluminous galaxies .",
    "some faint nearby galaxies with strong emission lines remaining undetected in hi must have very little gas or store their gas in ionised or molecular form .",
    "interestingly , the recent work by schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows that the hi mass function may become steeper at faint masses , in analogy with an upturn in the optical luminosity function at faint luminosities .",
    "detection limits for hi surveys remain quite high ( @xmath156 ) hence smaller pockets may still be hidden .",
    "on the other hand , isolated hi clouds with masses and sizes comparable to present dwarf galaxies would be easily seen with modern radio telescopes hence they must be very rare .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the damped qso absorption lines that tend to occur in the haloes of bright galaxies and not in smaller hi clouds ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; however see discussion in sect .",
    "it has been noted that the diffuse ionising background could drive hi clouds under the detection limits of current surveys ( see corbelli and salpeter 1993a , b ) .      evidently , the quest for finding more metal - poor galaxies is not over .",
    "the kiss ( kpno international spectroscopic survey , see salzer 1999 ) is a ccd based objective prism survey .",
    "it selects candidates from their h@xmath0 emission , an advantage in searching for low metallicity systems .",

    "the real advantage is the usage of ccd detectors which enables a more than fivefold increase in limiting distance compared to photographic surveys .",

    "follow - up spectroscopy to investigate low metallicity candidates is under way ( salzer , private communication ) .    in an attempt to detect low metallicity galaxies ,",
    "the calan - tololo survey plates have been searched by eye for objects without visible continuum , but with strong emission lines ( maza et al .",

    "more than two dozen galaxies with oxygen abundance of 1/10 @xmath5 or less have been found so far , and of these 8 are around 1/20 @xmath5 ( masegosa and maza , private communication ) .",
    "the hss ( hamburg / sao survey ) selects emission line dwarf galaxy candidates from the hamburg quasar survey plates . the hss has already yielded many new emission line dwarf galaxies ( ugruymov et al .",

    "in particular , since metallicity , luminosity and surface brightness are positively correlated we expect the existence of very metal - poor lsb dwarfs , like des and lsbgs .",

    "how do active star forming galaxies , in particular dwarf systems contribute to the luminosity function ( lf ) as compared to normal galaxies ?",

    "completeness problems are severe and combined with the need of large spatial coverage .",
    "even when samples become large enough , the problem remains to establish the nature of selected objects .",
    "low dispersion spectra must be used and require a diagnostic diagram to disentangle hii region - like spectra from agn .",
    "most lf determinations use a schmidt estimator ( schmidt 1968 ) combined with a v / vm test for completeness .",
    "one must bear in mind that such a test may not be adequate if large structures of our local universe are not sufficiently averaged out .",
    "the very faint end of the lf is naturally the most difficult to establish .",
    "deep ccd imaging using narrow - band filters complemented by follow up spectroscopy ( boroson et al . 1993 ) , dedicated to this problem points towards a moderate slope of the lf at low luminosities in agreement with larger samples from the case surveys or the um .",
    "these studies are not in agreement with others , showing that this problem will be settled only by a better understanding of selection biases .",
    "certainly surveys involving ccd techniques will allow to build larger and deeper samples .",
    "the space density of dwarf emission line galaxies has been addressed by salzer ( 1989 ) , who finds @xmath158 galaxies per mpc@xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath127% of the local field galaxy density based on the um survey .",
    "this number is dominated by intrinsically faint systems . a rough calculation of the space density of sbs galaxies from pustilnik et al .",
    "( 1995 ) immediately shows these to be an order of magnitude less abundant , probably an effect of different selection criteria .",
    "the case survey is even richer than the um survey and the emission line galaxies ( elgs ) , which it contains , may contribute up to one third of the field galaxy population ( salzer et al .",
    "the reason is that the case survey also is sensitive to galaxies with a low level of hii activity .",
    "a comparison of derived space densities of emission line / uv - excess dwarfs is given by comte et .",

    "these differences demonstrate once more that different surveys effectively target different types of galaxies .",
    "normal giant galaxies are found both in clusters and low density environments in the field .",
    "in particular giant ellipticals are strongly clustered and are predominantly found near the centres of rich clusters , while spiral galaxies are less clustered .",
    "the difference in the galaxy population in clusters and the field is an important observable , but not easy to interpret in view of the various effects that may affect galaxies in different environments : merging , interactions , harassment , dynamical disruption , stripping , cooling flows , pressure confinement by hot gas etc .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies are found predominantly in clusters or as companions of giant field galaxies ( binggeli et al .",
    "1990 ) and there appears to be a lack of isolated field des . the last point may in part be due to selection effects , since low luminosity des have low surface brightness and may therefore have been missed by most local surveys .",
    "new de members of the local group are still being discovered ( armandroff et al .",

    "large volume limited samples of lsbgs are required for this purpose .",

    "these hi companions tend to have faint optical counterparts ( taylor , private communication ) , and are thus likely to be lsbgs themselves .",
    "this suggests that lsbgs need not to be extremely isolated .",
    "it is however clear that lsbgs avoid massive giant galaxies , which is understandable since lsbgs close to giant galaxies have a high probability to interact which would lead to increase their star formation rate , thus transforming the lsbg into a high surface brightness galaxy .",

    "( 1985 ) presented results suggesting that hii galaxies are less clustered than normal giants .",

    "( 1995 ) who found similar results , but in addition a significant fraction ( @xmath159 ) was found in voids .",
    "most hii galaxies / bcgs seem to be rather isolated when compared to existing galaxy catalogues and redshift surveys ( campos - aguilar et al .",
    "1993 , telles and terlevich 1995 ) . but",
    "these results mainly show that bcgs avoid giant galaxies , since these constitute the catalogues used for comparison .",
    "no constraint can be imposed on the clustering with other dwarf galaxies , e.g. lsbgs .",
    "the latter have indeed been found to be common companions to hii galaxies from the studies by taylor and collaborators ( cf .",
    "taylor 1997 ) .",
    "a recent study ( telles and maddox 1999 ) attempts to address also the dwarf - dwarf clustering by comparing bcgs with apm ( automatic plate measuring machine ) catalogues , which contains more low luminosity galaxies , and comes to similar conclusions as previous studies in the sense that bcgs mainly populate environments less dense than normal galaxies .",
    "however , even the apm is badly incomplete for lsbgs , which are the likely companions in view of taylor results .    given the apparent tendency of bcgs to avoid dense environments , such as rich clusters , it has been speculated whether the voids may be filled with bcgs and other faint dwarfs such as lsbgs . if so the current view of the baryonic matter distribution in the universe would be very biased , and a large mass fraction would have been missed .",
    "this would be in agreement with `` biased '' galaxy formation theories ( e.g. dekel and silk 1986 ) where dwarfs arise from low density peaks in the primordial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "there have been some studies addressing this question : pustilnik et al .",

    "bcgs in or near voids are predominately found near the borders ( lindner et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the cases for other types of dwarfs , e.g. lsbgs , are less clear , but there is presently nothing that points toward a large density of any galaxy type in void , although this should be further investigated .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies seem to be abundant in most environments , both in rich clusters and as pure field galaxies ( binggeli et al . 1980 ) .",
    "however there are few studies addressing the dis directly , and we have already seen that this class generally encompasses many different kinds of low mass irregular galaxies , including bcgs and lsbgs .    in conclusion ,",
    "metal - poor bcds and lsbgs avoid rich cluster environments , but may have neighbours of the lsbg type .",
    "dwarf ellipticals are found in clusters or nearby luminous galaxies , while dis are found in most environments ( binggeli et al .",
    "as we saw in sections 3.1 and 3.2 , the metallicity of des and dis correlate positively with their luminosity ( aaronson 1986 , lequeux et al .",
    "1979 , kinman and davidson 1981 , skillman et al . 1989 ) . whether they follow the same relation is a subject of debate due to the uncertain scaling between [ o / h ] and [ fe / h ] ,",

    "4.2.1 ; and richer and mccall 1995 ) .",
    "it would be instructive to examine the location of bcgs and lsbgs in the metallicity  luminosity diagram .",

    "if there is no classification in the literature , but published images are available , we classified the galaxies according to this scheme .",
    "the solid line shows the @xmath57 relation for dis by richer and mccall ( 1995 ) , while the short and long dashed lines shows the relation for des ( see caption ) .    at first sight",
    "many bcgs do not appear extreme when compared to the normal dis .",
    "indeed some bcgs are more metal rich than dis at a given luminosity , while the opposite would be expected if bcgs were bursting dis . these bcgs may be in a post burst stage and the fresh metals may have become `` visible '' already .",
    "secondly , some `` extreme bcgs '' appear much more metal - poor at a given luminosity .",
    "these extreme bcgs ( xbcgs ) are 3 magnitudes brighter or more at a given metallicity , or equivalently 0.5 dex less metal rich at a given luminosity as compared to the di relation .",
    "there is a tendency for the marlowe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) blue amorphous galaxies to lie above the di relation .",
    "galaxies of type  ii follow the di relation in a broad sequence , while type i have a tendency to fall below the di relation .",
    "the same phenomenon is seen for four galaxies from the sample by stlin et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , of which three have irregular morphology ( type i ) .",
    "the most metal - poor galaxies also have irregular morphologies and fall far below the di relation .",
    "thus the bcgs span a factor of 10 in metallicity at a given luminosity .",
    "the intriguing xbcgs include izw18 and sbs  0335 - 052 , eso  338-ig04 ( = tololo  1924 - 516 ) , eso  400-g43 , haro  11(=eso  350-ig38 ) , eso  480-ig12 ( stlin et al .",

    "lsbgs occupy locations in the range from dis to xbcgs ( see also bergvall and rnnback 1994 , bergvall et al .",
    "1998 ) . while enriched galactic winds could possibly explain the extreme metal deficiency of the least massive dwarfs , the existence of xbcgs in general can not be understood in this way . while suggestive of important differences between different samples and types , these trends should be regarded as preliminary and should be put on more solid ground .",
    "another important relation , between hi mass and blue luminosity , has been addressed by several authors .",
    "a positive correlation was found by chamaraux ( 1977 ) for a sample of zwicky bcgs .",
    "it has been found ( e.g. staveley - smith et al .",
    "1992 ) that for gas rich dwarfs , the hydrogen mass to blue luminosity decreases with increasing luminosity , i.e. low luminosity galaxies are more hi rich , and have apparently converted a smaller fraction of their neutral gas content into stars .",
    "moreover , lsbgs have proportionally more hi than bcg in the sense that they have higher @xmath160 values ( see e.g. fig 1a in bergvall et al .",
    "bcgs and dis seem to have similar @xmath160 ratios .",
    "mcgaugh and de blok ( 1997 ) showed that , for a sample of disc galaxies ( extending from normal spirals to lsb dwarfs ) , @xmath160 increases systematically with decreasing surface brightness , and is typically @xmath161   ( solar units ) for lsbgs .",
    "lsbgs have low mass densities and have thus been inefficient in converting hi to stars and metals .",
    "thus , to a first approximation , metallicity anticorrelates with the gas mass fraction ( cf .",
    "lequeux et al .",
    "1979 , kinman and davidson 1981 , pagel 1997 ) as expected from closed box models , but this can not be the whole explanation ( matteucci and chiosi 1983 ) .",
    "dust  to ",
    "gas ratios positively correlate with metallicity for dis , while bcgs appear comparably more dust rich ( lisenfeld and ferrara 1998 ) , although in many bcgs one can only put upper limits to the dust content .",
    "the general relation between surface brightness and luminosity for dwarf and late type galaxies ( ferguson and binggeli 1994 ) , implies that dwarfs have low mass densities and/or are inefficient star formers .",
    "it has been argued that this could be a pure selection effect , since faint low surface brightness would be more difficult to detect ( phillipps et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "terlevich and melnick ( 1981 ) report a positive correlation between the h@xmath15 luminosity , the h@xmath15 line width , and linear size for giant hii regions and hii galaxies .",
    "subsequent work confirmed a dependence also on metallicity ( melnick et al .",

    "kobulnicky and zaritsky ( 1999 ) studied rather luminous emission line galaxies at redshift 0.1 to 0.5 , and found oxygen abundances from @xmath183 to @xmath5 , and n / o values consistent with local galaxies of similar metallicity .",
    "if , as in the local universe , low metallicity galaxies at high redshift would be dwarf galaxies of low or moderate luminosity , they would be missing in existing surveys .",
    "indeed , the luminosity function of lbgs at faint magnitudes is very steep , indicating a large population of intrinsically fainter objects lurking below the current detection threshold ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 )      the work of steidel and collaborators ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) has confirmed a substantial population of star - forming galaxies at  @xmath184 , with a comoving number density of roughly 10 to 50 % that of present day luminous ( @xmath185 ) galaxies . from these data it has been possible to sketch - although with large uncertainties and questions - the star - forming history of the universe at high redshifts ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) . from this work , and other similar samples , e.g. from the hdf",
    ", the overall sfr of the galaxy population seems to increase from  @xmath186   to  @xmath187 , during which time a significant fraction of the heavy elements in the universe are formed , while it tails off again towards higher redshift .",
    "recently , steidel et al . ( 1999 ) questioned the decrease in the number of star forming galaxies at high redshift , and suggest that the cosmic star formation rate as inferred from lyman break galaxies has been constant from @xmath188   to  @xmath189  .",
    "recent results from sub - mm observations of redshifted dust emission with the scuba bolometer array ( e.g. hughes et al . 1998 ) and from the iso satellite ( aussel et al . 1999 ; puget and guiderdoni1999 ) suggest that a significant amount of high redshift star formation may be dust obscured , meaning that estimates of the cosmic metal production rate from optical observations might be too low .",
    "the cosmic metal production history may also be constrained by observations of the extragalactic background at different wavelengths ( see pagel 1997 for a discussion ) .",
    "numerical simulations by cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) predict the evolution of the metal content of the universe as a function of density , by incorporating star formation and its feedback on the igm . at a given density ( corresponding e.g. to a rich cluster , a disc galaxy , dwarf etc . )",
    "their models predict an evolution with redshift , but more importantly , the metallicity is found to be a strong function of density . at low redshift ,",
    "low density environments will still be very metal - poor as suggested by the presence of very metal - poor gas - rich dwarf galaxies , and ly@xmath0 absorption systems ( shull et al .",
    "ferrara and tolstoy ( 1999 ) find in their simulations of the feedback from star formation on the ism in dwarf galaxies , that low mass galaxies could be the main contributor to metals in the igm .",
    "the idea of so called population iii objects has been discussed for quite a while .",
    "these hypothetical objects would be ( or host ) the first generation of stars , appearing before the main epoch of galaxy formation , and thus be a source of pre enrichment in the universe .",
    "the subject remains speculative , but the existence of pop iii stars can not be ruled out ( cayrel 1996 ) .",
    "what rle do metal - poor dwarf galaxies play in the hierarchical build - up of galaxies in the early universe ?",
    "observations suggest high merger frequencies at high redshift , but what is merging ?",
    "certainly not just normal spirals but more likely dwarfs that may or may not have counterparts in the local universe .",
    "if galaxies form by the cooling and condensation of gas within dark matter halos , the ability to detect them depends on the sizes of the pieces out of which galaxies are assembled and on the time interval during which this takes place .",
    "there have been suggestions that the principal galaxy building blocks are to be found throughout the redshift range of about  @xmath190   to  @xmath191 . in any case ,",
    "such young galaxies would , in their earliest phase , be expected to have strong emission lines but faint continua and would hence fall far below the magnitude threshold of current lyman break surveys .",
    "in fact there is a trend for local galaxies ( see for instance the terlevich et al .",
    "1991 , catalogue of hii galaxies , and fig .",
    "12 ) with very strong emission lines to have fainter magnitudes . moreover , if galaxies are more inclined to be in groups and clusters at the time of formation they offer an interesting challenge for existing cdm models .",
    "hst images obtained by pascarelle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have revealed emitting objects in sheets or clustered in ways that fit the theoretical picture of rauch et al .",
    "observations suggest high merger frequencies at high redshift , but again the nature of the merging blocks ( masses and metallicity ) remains to be investigated .",
    "have today s giant galaxies ( big spirals and ellipticals ) ever been metal - poor ?",
    "the intuitive answer would of course be ",
    "but , if massive galaxies are built up by successive merger of small galaxies , it is possible that they were already rather metal rich when reaching a total mass comparable to that of an @xmath153 galaxy . in that case",
    ", the only metal - poor galaxies at any redshift will be low mass galaxies , difficult to study at cosmological distances .",
    "a long standing problem in galaxy formation models is the so called overcooling problem ( white and rees 1978 ) , leading to an overproduction of dwarf galaxies at the expense of massive galaxies , in disagreement with observations of the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "this problem still remains in current galaxy formation models ( cf .",
    "somerville and primack 1998 ) .",
    "various mechanisms , have been proposed such as sn feedback and a high uv background keeping dwarf sized clouds ionised , preventing them to cool ( efstathiou 1992 ) .",
    "the problem may be somewhat relaxed if most dwarfs have merged into giants or have been disrupted .",
    "if some low mass galaxies formed before the universe was re - ionised and subsequently experience a blow - out of their ism , they could represent population iii objects , responsible for cosmic metal enrichment at very early epochs ( see ferrara and tolstoy 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "it is established that giant extragalactic hii regions ( gehrs ) display a correlation between their intrinsic luminosities and the width of their emission lines , the @xmath192@xmath193 relation ( terlevich & melnick 1981 ) .",
    "melnick et al . ( 1987,1988 ) have shown that the relation found for gehrs holds also for hii galaxies .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath192@xmath193 relation is small enough that it can be used to determine distances .",
    "recent work with hires at the keck ( koo et al .",
    "1995 , guzmn et al .",
    "1996 ) has shown that a large fraction of the numerous compact galaxies found at intermediate redshifts have kinematical properties similar to those of luminous local hii galaxies .",
    "they exhibit fairly narrow emission line widths ( @xmath194   to   @xmath195  km / s ) rather than the 200 km / s typical for galaxies of similar luminosities .",
    "in particular galaxies with @xmath196 km / s seem to follow the same relations in @xmath192 , @xmath135 and @xmath193 as the local ones .",
    "recent infrared spectroscopy of balmer emission lines in a few lyman break galaxies at @xmath197 ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that these adhere to the same relation , although this has to be confirmed for a larger sample .",
    "this opens the important possibility of applying the distance estimator and map the hubble flow up to extremely high redshifts and simultaneously to study the behaviour of starbursts of similar luminosities over a huge redshift range .",
    "it may prove to be a useful method to measure @xmath198 because the redshift interval of present day applicability considering the most luminous hii galaxies is larger than for methods involving sne , allowing a good discrimination between deceleration ( @xmath198 ) and curvature ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "possible complications concern the treatment of the effects of metallicity and extinction in these systems .",
    "extreme properties are often sought for in astronomy as one way to sharpen our understanding of fundamental concepts . in such a context",
    ", metallicity proves to be of crucial importance . because metals build up as a function of time after the release of nucleosynthesis products , the most metal - poor galaxies help us to understand the primordial universe and the subsequent formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we have discussed in this paper the reason why local metal - poor galaxies are found amongst the dwarfs .",
    "whether this property remains true at high redshift where proto - galaxies begin to form , is certainly a challenging question . if the hierarchical model of galaxy formation is correct and if building block galaxies are similar to the well - studied dwarfs we discussed in this review they may be unreachable observationally , even with the advent of the most recent large telescopes .",
    "on the other hand , large , massive and gas - rich proto - galaxies may have some properties similar to those of the most unevolved objects we see today .",
    "the same applies to the distant starbursts that have been found using lyman break techniques or ly@xmath0 emission searches .",
    "evolution versus formation has been a clear issue in order to characterise the few known extreme star - forming dwarfs like izw18 . most of the properties of these galaxies : blue colours , gas and dust content , and extreme metal deficiency once led to the belief that , although rare , small condensations were able to produce genuinely young galaxies at the current cosmic epoch .",
    "this question has indeed received a lot of attention in the recent years but we consider it as somewhat `` pass '' . in most cases - but for a few intriguing ones - an old underlying stellar population has been found , revealing one or several previous bursts of star formation .",
    "the same seems to apply to dwarf gas - poor galaxies as one can tell from the study of their colour magnitude diagrams .",
    "the problem of the existence of local young galaxies may not be completely solved yet but its importance is less acute , since in any case , there is no significant population of dwarf galaxies still in the process of formation .",
    "evidences that most of the galaxies were formed at ealier epochs come from a more direct view of what the universe looks like at high redshift and also the hint that the metal production rate in the universe has passed its peak",
    ". the question of present cosmological interest would rather be to determine the epoch when the bulk of dwarfs were formed .",
    "was the formation of dwarfs confined to very high redshifts , or was it still going on at intermediate redshifts where the faint blue galaxies emerge and the universe was about 2/3 its present age ?    nevertheless , for years , local extremely metal poor galaxies turned out to be our best test laboratory .",
    "we have learned a lot about the properties of their massive stars ( formation and evolution , appearance of wr stars ) , the evolution of the dynamics of the gas in the gravitational potential of the parent galaxy as a superbubble evolves and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium after the fresh products are well mixed .",
    "we have discussed their dynamical properties and interactions with companions in order to understand the triggering mechanism that ignites their bursts of star formation .",
    "these galaxies have been modelled to constrain the scenario of the starbursts , with the major motivation of describing how various classes of dwarfs could be linked together into one or several evolutionary scenarios .",
    "this is not completely settled yet and a lot of work is still needed both theoretically and observationally in this area .",
    "surveys are aimed to build luminosity functions that will help in answering some of the above questions and also produce new targets that will open the possibility to investigate the properties of metal - poor galaxies at much larger redshift .",
    "we clearly enter a new area in which metal - poor galaxies and the sub - class of metal - poor dwarf galaxies will observationally begin to be considered in cosmology .",
    "they enter in the study of the cosmic metal enrichment , the possibility to establish new distance indicators , the study of the yield of heavy elements and the derivation of the primordial helium , and finally the rle these galaxies play in the hierarchial buildup of structures in the universe .",
    "will we ever find a metal - free galaxy ?",
    "in our local universe we concur that young galaxies ( hence possible metal free candidates ) are unlikely to be found .",
    "in fact we have stressed that the most metal poor known dwarf galaxies are orders of magnitudes more metal rich than the most extreme halo stars in our galaxy ( cayrel 1996 ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the galactic disc stars and the so - called g - dwarf problem ( pagel 1997 ) indicate pre - enrichment before the disc formed . the oldest known systems in our galaxy ( and the universe ) , the halo globular clusters , have metallicities similar to local dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "hence , the oldest globular clusters were self enriched or formed from pre - polluted material . at high redshift",
    "the challenge is to pick up galaxies at the epoch of formation . if our galaxy is a representative case we do not expect pristine ( or nearly pristine , with abundances much lower than the most metal - poor local dwarf galaxies ) matter to be found anywhere but in dwarfs or sub galactic clumps .",

    "<S> metallicity is a key parameter that controls many aspects in the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the metal deficient galaxies , in particular the most metal - poor ones , because they play a crucial rle in the cosmic scenery . </S>",
    "<S> we first set the stage by discussing the difficult problem of defining a global metallicity and how this quantity can be measured for a given galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanisms that control the metallicity in a galaxy are reviewed in detail and involve many aspects of modern astrophysics : galaxy formation and evolution , massive star formation , stellar winds , chemical yields , outflows and inflows etc . </S>",
    "<S> because metallicity roughly scales as the galactic mass , it is among the dwarfs that the most metal - poor galaxies are found . </S>",
    "<S> the core of our paper reviews the considerable progress made in our understanding of the properties and the physical processes that are at work in these objects . </S>",
    "<S> the question on how they are related and may evolve from one class of objects to another is discussed . while discussing metal - poor galaxies in general , we present a more detailed discussion of a few very metal - poor blue compact dwarf galaxies like izw18 . although most of what is known relates to our local universe , we show that it pertains to our quest for primeval galaxies and is connected to the question of the origin of structure in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss what qso absorption lines and known distant galaxies tell us already ? </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the importance of star - forming metal - poor galaxies for the determination of the primordial helium abundance , their use as distance indicator and discuss the possibility to detect nearly metal - free galaxies at high redshift from ly@xmath0 emission . + * keywords : * galaxies : abundances  galaxies : compact  galaxies : dwarf  galaxies : individual : izw18  galaxies : individual : sbs  </S>",
