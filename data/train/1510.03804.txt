    "[ r2 ] here , we remark that the measurable function @xmath47 parametrizes absolutely continuous changes of measure to the stochastic representation in ( e.g. , see @xcite for additional discussions on transforming stochastic processes ) . such changes of measure can be used to specify model uncertainty in terms of relative entropy as a single constraint on the entire path of perturbation ( e.g. , see @xcite or @xcite for additional discussions ) .    before concluding this section it is worth mentioning that some studies on the controllability of systems , governed by parabolic equations , have been reported in literature ( to mention a few , e.g. , see @xcite in the context of stackelberg optimization ; and @xcite and @xcite in the context of stackelberg - nash controllability - type problem ) .",
    "recently , apart from the issue of modeling and uncertainty , the authors in @xcite ( which is a companion to the present work ) have also provided some results pertaining to a chain of distributed control systems .",
    "note that the rationale behind our framework follows in some sense the settings of these papers , where we provide a mathematical framework that addresses the problem of optimal distributed control , in the context of hierarchical control argument , with model uncertainty .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ] , using the basic remarks made in section  [ s1 ] , we state the hierarchal control problem considered in this paper .",
