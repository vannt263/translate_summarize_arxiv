    "polymer electrolytes @xcite have received increasing attention for electrolytic applications in energy storing devices like batteries .",
    "cations , ideally lithium ions ( li@xmath0 ) , supplied by a dissociated salt in a polymer medium provide for the charge conduction .",
    "it is known from experiments and computer simulations that the collective diffusivity ( which is directly related to the ionic conductivity ) in polymer electrolytes falls short of the average diffusivity of the charge carrying species ( i.e. cations and anions ) . the reason is attributed to the presence of motional correlations between the unlike charges .",
    "molecular dynamics simulation @xcite of an amorphous polymer electrolyte offers the possibility of exploring the nature of ionic correlations and their repercussions on the ionic conductivity . during the past decade realistic simulations on linear chains of poly(ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) with lithium salt have yielded insight into the ionic mobilities and conductivities @xcite .",
    "typically , cations in polymer electrolytes can exist with or without the presence of anions in their vicinity .",
    "cations which are coordinated solely by the ether oxygen ( eo ) atoms of the polymer host ( i.e. peo ) are the so called _ free _ carriers and their proportion is important for the magnitude of ionic conductivity .",
    "however , a cation can also attract one , two or more anionic neighbors around itself forming the so called _ pairs _ , _ triplets _ or higher order _ clusters_. the distribution of the oxygen and the anionic coordination numbers is a consequence of the rich interplay between the interionic interactions and polymer entropy .",
    "presence of ionic aggregates , specifically the neutral ones like the _ pairs _ , will not contribute to conductivity .",
    "the average diffusivity of the ions , @xmath1 is related to the ionic conductivity , @xmath2 , in an electrolyte at temperature t by the equation    [ nernst ] @xmath3    here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the diffusivity and the ionic fraction of species @xmath6 , respectively ; @xmath7 the haven ratio , @xmath8 @xcite the collective diffusivity ; and @xmath9 is the total number of ions ( both cations and anions ) , in a volume @xmath10 . with @xmath11",
    ".   expresses the nernst - einstein equation .",
    "@xmath8 can be found from conductivity experiments @xcite whereas @xmath4 can be obtained from tracer diffusion measurements @xcite or pfg - nmr @xcite . without ionic correlations",
    "the haven ratio @xmath7 is unity , yielding @xmath12 .",
    "if ionic correlations are present this relation needs to be augmented by the contributions from the cross correlation terms between the distinct ions , yielding @xmath13 .",
    "correlated ionic motion can cause either @xmath14 ( as in inorganic ionic conductors ) or @xmath15 ( as in polymer electrolytes ) . note that in the latter case several cross correlations are present ( cation - cation , anion - anion and cation - anion ) .",
    "recently stolwijk and obeidi proposed a model ( so - model ) that aims to explain the depression of ionic conductivity relative to the average ionic diffusivity in a representative electrolyte system of peo and sodium iodide ( nai ) @xcite .",
    "this model is an attempt to determine the mobilities of free ions and ion - pairs from the experimental information comprising of the tracer diffusivities of the ions and the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte system .",
    "the key assumption of the model is that the ions exist either as free na@xmath0 and free i@xmath16 or in the form of contact ion - pairs ( na@xmath0 @xmath17 i@xmath16 ) .",
    "though the ion - pairs contribute to mass transport , they do not participate in charge transport due to charge neutrality , thereby , resulting in a diminished ionic conductivity .",
    "their model predicts that , over a broad temperature range , the ion - pairs are orders of magnitude faster than either of the free ionic species @xcite",
    ". this led them to interpret that the ion - pairs are not coordinated with the ether oxygen atoms . in light of the insights from computer simulations where most of the cations ( both free and those associated with anions )",
    "are structurally correlated and dynamically coupled to the ether oxygen atoms @xcite the so model can be extended to accommodate the scenario where the free ions and ion - pairs should display similar mobility .    in this work",
    "we explore in detail the microscopic characteristics of the cross correlation contribution in a polymer melt via computer simulations for peo with lithium iodide ( lii ) as a salt .",
    "our goal is fourfold .",
    "first , we derive an exact formal equation for @xmath18 [ viz .",
    "eq .  ] which fully contains the effect of dynamic correlations .",
    "second , these correlations are interpreted in terms of simple physical pictures .",
    "for example it will be shown that ionic correlations exist beyond the nearest neighbor shell which implies that structural ion - pairs , i.e. those which are nearest neighbors , are not sufficient to grasp correlation effects .",
    "third , we introduce a number of approximations such that the exact equation boils down to the phenomenological so - model together with a few phenomenological parameters ( all close to but not exactly one ) by which we keep track of the approximations . for the present system",
    ", the values of these parameters can be retrieved from the simulations .",
    "this offers the possibility of turning the so - model more general and accurate .",
    "this attempt also brings out the necessity of additional information apart from merely the tracer diffusivities and ionic conductivity to quantify the microscopic dynamics .",
    "fourth , we apply the extended so - model to the experimental data , reported in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the data can be explained without invoking significant dynamical differences between the free ions and ion - pairs .",
    "the resulting fraction of associated ions from the model can be compared against the experimentally obtained information about the proportions of structural pairs via raman scattering techniques .",
    "we have performed _ all - atom _ molecular dynamics simulation @xcite on a system of a polymer electrolyte comprising of chains of peo and lii as the salt in the canonical ensemble ( nvt ) using the gromacs @xcite package .",
    "the salt concentration in terms of the number of eo units and li@xmath0 ions in the system was eo : li@xmath0=20:1 .",
    "conventional periodic boundary conditions were applied to get rid of surface effects .",
    "the simulation box contained 32 peo chains .",
    "each of the polymer chains had the chemical formula h(ch@xmath19@xmath17o@xmath17ch@xmath19)@xmath20h where @xmath21 is the number of repeat units or chain length ( fig .",
    "[ peo ] ) . in this work",
    "we have chosen @xmath22 which is a reasonable chain length to study the dynamics of the ions / polymers within a production run time window of @xmath23 85 ns following an equlibration time of about 10 ns .",
    "the nose - hoover thermostat @xcite algorithm was set to maintain an average temperature throughout the simulation run .",
    "the temperatures chosen were t = 425 k and t = 450 k. the relaxation time of the peo chains in terms of the rouse time , calculated by fitting the rouse model @xcite to the dynamics of the oxygen atoms were about 9.5 and 4.3 ns at t = 425 k and t = 450 k , respectively .",
    "these relatively high temperatures were necessary to achieve equilibration and obtain reasonable estimates , in particular , for the collective diffusivity . prior to",
    "the nvt runs the system density had been adjusted via an npt ( isobaric - isothermal ensemble with constant number of particles ) run for durations of about 5 ns with an average pressure of 1 mpa .",
    "the starting configuration of the polymer melt for the npt run was picked up from a thoroughly equilibrated system of neat peo at a temperature of 500 k. the ions were then randomly dispersed in it ( i.e.   positions of the ions were randomly selected ) such that the minimum distance between a newly placed ion and the already existing particles ( i.e.  previously placed ions as well as atoms of the polymer ) in the system was about 3  . to obtain a stable configuration ,",
    "the system was then energy - minimised using the steepest descent technique @xcite .",
    "the subsequent npt runs produced converged average densities of 1082 g@xmath24 and 1099 g@xmath24 at t = 450 k and t = 425 k respectively .",
    "the density fluctuations were of the order of 3.5 g@xmath24 . following the npt runs , the systems were further equilibrated at constant density and temperature ( nvt ) for more than 5 ns . in this paper we restrict ourselves to the data because of the better statistics .     the atomistic model of poly(ethylene oxide ) with the partial charges used are -0.0326 for carbon ( cyan ) , -0.2792 for oxygen ( red ) , 0.0861 for hydrogen ( white ) and -0.1187 for the terminal carbon atoms @xcite . ]",
    "the force field for the description of intra- ( bond lengths , bend - angle and dihedral potentials parameters ) and inter - molecular ( e.g.  buckingham potential parameters , partial charges ) interactions of the peo and the interactions between the peo and the li@xmath0 ions are taken from refs.@xcite .",
    "the interactions between the i@xmath16 ions and the peo and between the ions are essentially from ref.@xcite with slight modifications @xcite .",
    "the attractive part of the buckingham potential between the , and have been slightly diminished .",
    "however , the charges ( @xmath251@xmath26 and @xmath171@xmath26 for li@xmath0 and i@xmath16 , respectively ) and the coulomb interactions between the ions were unaltered and calculated using the particle - mesh ewald technique within a distance cut - off of 10  .",
    "this was done in order to generate a higher number of isolated _ ion - pairs _ and _ ion - triplets_. however , the fraction of free and non - free ions in the system remained the same . notwithstanding , with this modification the equilibrium polymer conformation of the sequence of dihedrals for the triad o@xmath17c@xmath17c@xmath17o was found to be in agreement with the published results of ref .",

    "furthermore , the reduction of the ionic diffusivity [ i.e.  @xmath36 is close to the experimentally observed value .    from the simulation we identify a non - free ion as one which is associated with a counterion such that it is separated by a distance of less than 4.6 that",

    "in the first section ionic correlations in a polymer electrolyte ( e.g.  the archetypal peo / lii ) stemming from ionic associations are elucidated by constructing elementary correlation functions .",
    "one of these functions included the time - evolution of the directional correlation of a pair of ions ( both like - charged and unlike - charged ) in dependence of the separation distance between the ions .",
    "the correlations from the pairs are found to be the strongest in comparison to the and pairs of ions .",
    "furthermore , the correlation effects are found to exist beyond the nearest neighborhood of counterions , albeit reduced due to the screening of interactions .",
    "in essence , the strong structural correlations together with the non - trivial values of the directional correlations between the cation - anion pairs lead to a reduction of the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte compared to the average diffusivity of the ions . the joint mobility of a pair of ions calculated as the product of the magnitude of the displacement vectors of the ions showed that during a certain time this is almost independent of the structural correlations between the ions .",
    "one can thus infer that the dynamics of the different states of ions ( i.e.  free ions , ion - pairs , ion - triplets etc . )",
    "will be similar .",
    "intuitively , due to the fact that most of the lithium ions are coupled to the ether oxygen atoms of the peo one would expect some correlations between the dynamics of the free and the associated ions .",
    "this is , additionally , verified by computing the mean square displacement of the free li@xmath0 , isolated li@xmath41i@xmath16 pairs and the isolated i@xmath42li@xmath41i@xmath16 triplets .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the conclusion from the stolwijk - obeidi model @xcite which predicted the dynamics of ion - pairs to be orders of magnitude faster than the free ions .    in the second section the so model",
    "is extended by starting from the einstein - like equation which describes the collective diffusivity of the ions from the single - particle dynamics of the ions ( the self terms ) and the correlations from the distinct pairs of ions . instead of describing the overall correlation effects only in terms of the dynamics and the fraction of isolated ion - pairs we generalised the approach by considering the dynamics and the fraction of non - free ions .",
    "typically , the non - free ions account for the presence of ion - triplets or any higher order clusters along with the ion - pairs .",
    "additionally , various approximation parameters , @xmath43 , are incorporated that keep track of the simplifications made to the correlated term of the einstein - like equation .",
    "the simplifications can further be understood in terms of simple microscopic pictures .",
    "the parameters could be extracted from simulations and are found to be close to unity which is a consequence of the nature of ionic association and dynamics in polymer electrolytes .",
    "if each of these parameters except @xmath44 ( which appeared as a result in the so model ) are chosen to be exactly unity one recovers the so model .",
    "the extended so model along with the inference of dynamical similarity between the free and the non - free ions is applied to the same data as in ref .  @xcite but with the additional parameters chosen from simulation . it is found that the fraction of non - free ions are high and consistent with the simulation results .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 also turns out to be more important compared to the other parameters ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) specifically for yielding the estimates of the diffusivity of free i@xmath16 ions .",
    "typically , @xmath50 expresses the difference in timescales over which the cations and the anions become diffusive and reflects a characteristic of polymer electrolytes where the cations are predominantly complexed with atoms / groups located along the main backbone of the polymer for larger timescales in comparison to the anions which are coordinated to the same cationic neighbors for relatively short times .",
    "it must be , however , borne in mind that the results ( i.e.  fraction of non - free ions and the diffusivity of free ions ) from the so model depend on the accuracy of the input experimental data and possibly on the temperature dependence of one or more of the parameters ( e.g.  @xmath46 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "further work is required to map the values of the parameters as a function of interaction between ions and the resulting collective diffusivity of ions that would impart general applicability to quantifying ionic association .",
    "+ let @xmath9 be the total number of ions in the system and so the number of cations and anions are @xmath52 respectively .",
    "defining the quantity @xmath53 as follows @xmath54 one can show that eq .   can be derived from eq .   and eq .   through the following steps",
