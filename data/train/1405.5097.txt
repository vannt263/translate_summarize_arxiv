    "online social networks ( osns ) such as facebook , sina weibo , and twitter have attracted researchers much attention in recent years because of their ever - increasing popularity and importance in our daily lives  @xcite .",
    "an osn not only provides a platform for people to connect with their friends , but also provides an opportunity for researchers to study user characteristics , which are valuable for applications such as marketing decision making .",
    "for example , twitter users tweeting activities ( e.g. , number of tweets related to a movie ) can be used to predict movie box - office revenues  @xcite , and twitter users mood characteristics have a relation with stock market prices  @xcite .",
    "therefore , measuring user characteristics in osns is an important task .    exactly calculating user characteristics requires the complete osn data .",
    "however , for third parties who do not own the data can only rely on public apis to crawl the osn . to protect user privacy ,",
    "osns usually impose barriers to limit third parties large - scale crawling  @xcite and restrict the rate of requesting apis ( e.g. , sina weibo allows a user to issue at most 150 requests per hour  @xcite ) . as a result , crawling the complete data of a large - scale osn is practically impossible .    to address this challenge ,",
    "sampling methods are developed , i.e. , a small fraction of osn users are sampled and used to calculate the characteristics . in the literature ,",
    "random walk based sampling methods have become popular  @xcite .",
    "a random walker starts from an initial node in the osn , and randomly selects a neighbor to visit at the next step ; this process repeats until the sampling budget is exhausted .",
    "the random walk sampling can generate markov chain samples which are able to provide unbiased estimates of graph statistics  @xcite .",
    "* motivation : * if a graph has community structure , the random walk will suffer from _ slow mixing _ ,",
    "i.e. , requiring a long burning period to reach the steady state , which results in a substantially large number of samples so as to keep estimation accuracy .",
    "recent studies have found that the mixing time in several real - world networks is much longer than expected  @xcite .",
    "to overcome the slow mixing problem , one effective approach is to allow the random walker(s ) to randomly jump to ( or start from ) different regions of a network , such as _ random walk with jumps _ ( rwwj )  @xcite and _ frontier sampling _ ( fs )  @xcite .",
    "these methods explicitly or implicitly assume that _ random vertex sampling _ is enabled .",
    "for example , in rwwj , the walker can randomly jump to other nodes while walking , and the initializing step in fs relies on uniform vertex sampling .",
    "however , random vertex sampling can be resource - intensive when the _ effective _ account i d space is very sparsely populated such as the following example .",
    "[ exam : weibo ] a restaurant company wants to build a new chain store in one of two small candidate cities in china .",
    "a market surveyor is sent to study the consuming ability of citizens there .",
    "since most citizens use the check - in service  @xcite to share their consuming information in weibo , the surveyor decides to use weibo as a platform to conduct his research .",
    "he plans to uniformly sample two collections of weibo users in the two cities respectively .",
    "it is known that every weibo account i d consists of ten digits ranging from `` 1000000000 '' to the maximum .",
    "he generates random numbers in this range as test ids and finds that about @xmath0 of the test ids are valid weibo users .",
    "however , because the population sizes of the two cities are small ( e.g. , hundreds of thousands of citizens comparing to the hundreds of millions of weibo users ) , the valid users falling into the two cities has probability as small as @xmath1 .    in the above example",
    ", an effective test i d must fall into one of the two cities , and random vertex sampling becomes extremely inefficient because the probability that a test i d is effective equals @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this results in that the surveyor needs to try @xmath5 times on average to obtain a valid i d falling in one of the two cities . to make matters worse",
    ", in some osns such as pinterest , account ids are arbitrary - length strings , which makes random vertex sampling practically impossible .",
    "so , _ how can we sample vertex randomly in an osn when random vertex sampling is extremely inefficient or impractical at all ? _",
    "* present work : * in example  [ exam : weibo ] , the key problem is how to effectively sample weibo users within the two cities .",
    "we notice that the check - ins shared by users often contain the venue information , e.g. , in which restaurant the user lunched , and most such osns ( e.g. , foursquare ) provide apis for querying venues ( e.g. , restaurants ) within an area of interest by specifying a rectangle region with the bottom - left and top - right corners latitude - longitude coordinates given , or a circle region with the center point latitude - longitude coordinate and radius given .",
    "this function can be used to design efficient sampling methods for sampling venues on a map  @xcite .",
    "since we can sample venues within an area easily , we are able to _ indirectly _ sample weibo users in an area by _ relating users to venues through check - in relationships between them_. this will be more efficient than directly sampling users in an area . we leave the detailed design of this sampling method in section  [ sec : methods ] and evaluate it in section  [ sec : experiment ] .    more than solving a particular problem in example  [ exam : weibo ] , we are inspired to study a more generalized problem .",
    "if we consider the venues in example  [ exam : weibo ] as another type of nodes besides user nodes , we can build three graphs , i.e. , ( 1 ) a user graph formed by users and their relationships , ( 2 ) a venue graph formed by venues and their relationships ( the edge set can be empty as in example  [ exam : weibo ] ) , and ( 3 ) a bipartite graph formed by users , venues and their check - in relationships .",
    "what we learned from example  [ exam : weibo ] is that , when _ directly _ sampling the user graph is very difficult or extremely inefficient , we can try to sample the venue graph ( which is easier as in example  [ exam : weibo ] ) , and the bipartite graph acts as a bridge to connect them .",
    "this approach facilitates us to sample user graph _ indirectly _ but efficiently .",
    "because the _ affiliation relationship _ between users and venues plays an important role in these graphs , we refer to the three graphs as a _ hybrid social - affiliation network _ jointly .",
    "the formal definition of hybrid social - affiliation network will be given in section  [ sec : problem ] , and the detailed design of sampling methods on hybrid social - affiliation networks will be depicted in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "* contributions : * overall",
    ", we have three main contributions :    * ( _ problem novelty _ ) we define the idea of hybrid social - affiliation network and formulate a sampling problem over it .",
    "( section  [ sec : problem ] ) . *",
    "( _ solution novelty _ ) we design three efficient sampling methods over such a network .",
    "these methods facilitate us to indirectly sample a graph efficiently when directly sampling it is difficult ( section  [ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "* we conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed methods over both synthetic and real - world networks ( section  [ sec : experiment ] ) .",
    "in this section , we first define the graph characteristics that we want to measure in this work , and then formally define the hybrid social - affiliation network along with the sampling problem over it .",
    "we model an osn by an undirected graph @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the sets of users and relations among users , respectively .",
    "users in @xmath9 are labeled .",
    "let @xmath10 be a set of user labels of size @xmath11 .",
    "we map each user @xmath12 to a subset of labels he owned by a set function called _ characteristic function _ @xmath13 .",
    "for example , if @xmath14 , then @xmath15 represents the gender of @xmath16 .    in many applications , we are interested in measuring the fractions of users having some labels , e.g. , the fraction of male / female customers buying a product .",
    "this can be represented by the label distribution @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fraction of users with label @xmath19 .",
    "that is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the size of graph @xmath9 , and @xmath22 is the indicator function .",
    "when the graph size @xmath23 is known or can be estimated  @xcite , we can also obtain the absolute volume of users having a label @xmath19 by @xmath24 .    with this definition of graph characteristics , the objective of sampling then becomes how to collect samples ( i.e. , nodes ) from graph @xmath9 and design estimators to estimate parameters @xmath25 based on these samples .",
    "example  [ exam : weibo ] motivates us to define a _ hybrid social - affiliation network _ when directly sampling graph @xmath9 is difficult or inefficient .",
    "a hybrid social - affiliation network consists of three graphs : @xmath6 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are sets of nodes and @xmath29 are sets of edges . in detail ,    * @xmath6 is the _ target graph _ whose characteristics @xmath30 are of interest and need to be measured , e.g. , the user social network in example  [ exam : weibo ] . * @xmath26 is an _ auxiliary graph _ which can be sampled more easily or efficiently than sampling the target graph , e.g. , the venue graph ( with @xmath31 ) in example  [ exam : weibo ] .",
    "* @xmath27 is an _ affiliation graph _",
    "* chapter 8) which is a bipartite graph connecting nodes in the target and auxiliary graphs , e.g. , the graph formed by users , venues and their check - in relationships in example  [ exam : weibo ] .",

    "[ fig : exam ] .",
    "in addition to example  [ exam : weibo ] , many other measuring problems can be formed as a hybrid social - affiliation network sampling problem . as another case ,",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "[ exam : mtime ] mtime.com  @xcite is an online movie database in china .",
    "users in mtime can follow each other to form a social network .",
    "moreover , a user can follow movie actors if he is a fan of the actor .",
    "the movie actors can also form connections if they cooperated in a same movie .",
    "in example  [ exam : mtime ] , if we want to measure the characteristics of the graph formed by mtime users , and directly sampling users is inefficient ( because of the community structure formed by user interests difference , geographic constraints etc . , which make the user graph not well connected ) we can build a hybrid social - affiliation network as follows :    * _ the target graph _ is formed by mtime users and their following relationships . * _ the auxiliary graph _ is formed by actors and their cooperation relationships . * _ the affiliation graph _ is formed by mtime users and actors and the fan relationships between them .",
    "other than the ordinary people , movie actors especially pop stars are more easily to form connections since they have more chances to join same events such as oscar and cannes .",
    "that is , the auxiliary graph is more likely to be well connected than the target graph .",
    "we can leverage this feature to design efficient sampling methods to measure target graph characteristics .",
    "in this section , we design three sampling methods for measuring target graph characteristics on a hybrid social - affiliation network .",
    "the notations that will be used in this section are summarized in table  [ tab : notations ] .",
    ".notations[tab : notations ] [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     an isolated node in a graph is a node with zero degree .",
    "* analysis of the dataset . *",
    "first , we provide some basic analysis of the mtime dataset . in table  [ tab : mtime ] , we compare the first and second blocks , which are related to the target graph @xmath9 and auxiliary graph @xmath34 respectively .",
    "we find that about @xmath35 of the user ids and @xmath36 of the actor ids are valid .",
    "this indicates that vertex sampling in auxiliary graph is more efficient than in target graph .",
    "moreover , we can find that about @xmath37 of users are isolated , i.e. , having zero degree , but the same number for actors is less than @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the auxiliary graph is better connected than the target graph .",
    "although a large fraction of users are isolated nodes in the target graph , from the last block in table  [ tab : mtime ] ( regarding the affiliation graph @xmath38 ) , we find that almost all the isolated users are connected to non - isolated actors ( except a few hundreds of them ) .",
