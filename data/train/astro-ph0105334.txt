    "the jodrell bank - vla astrometric survey ( jvas ) of flat - spectrum sources yielded a catalog of 2118 compact radio sources @xcite .",
    "each compact source ( a ) has a peak flux density at 8.4  ghz @xmath1 50  mjy at a resolution of 200 milliarcsecond ( mas ) ; ( b ) contains 80% or more of the total source flux density ; and ( c ) has a position known to an rms accuracy of 12@xmath255  mas .",
    "the 2118 sources are uniformly distributed in the northern sky at galactic latitudes @xmath3 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "although these sources are primarily intended for use as phase calibrators for the jodrell bank merlin , they are also suitable as phase calibrators for the nrao very large array ( vla ) and can be considered as candidate phase calibrators for the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) and for millimeter arrays @xcite .",
    "jvas suffers from a zone of avoidance because galactic confusion prevented selection of flat - spectrum sources at @xmath4 .",
    "fortunately , there is another way of selecting potential phase calibrators that is less susceptible to galactic confusion : seek sources that vary with time and must , therefore , have significant contributions from compact components .",
    "a seven - beam receiver was used on the former nrao 91-m telescope , during 1986 november and 1987 october , to survey repeatedly the declination band @xmath5 at 4.85  ghz with a resolution of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this database to extract variability information for sources in the gb6 catalog @xcite , the large unbiased sample of 75,162 sources derived from the combined survey images .",
    "gb6 sources were selected with @xmath7  mjy and with a flux density variation @xmath8 between 1986 and 1987 .",
    "the sky distribution of these long - term gb6 variables was dominantly isotropic , implying an extragalactic population . imposing a further constraint of @xmath4 on these gb6 variables leads to 97 potential phase calibrators in the jvas zone of avoidance .",
    "new vla observations in the jvas style of these gb6 variables would help supplement the jvas lists , thereby improving the prospects for vlba phase - referencing of galactic targets and strengthening the lists usefulness for studies of the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "the vla @xcite was used 1999 june 18 ut in its a ( 36-km ) configuration to observe 53 of the 97 gb6 variables .",
    "some additional sources initially suspected of variability were also observed @xcite .",
    "data were acquired in dual circular polarizations with bandwidths of 25  mhz and at center frequencies of 4.5351 , 4.8851 , 8.1149 , and 8.4851  ghz .",
    "observations were made assuming a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "phase calibration sources were selected from the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) as realized by vlbi @xcite , with positions from the reference frame update of 1998 - 6 in the vlba correlator database ( t.m .",
    "eubanks , private communication ) .",
    "the switching time between phase calibrator observations was 6  minutes .",
    "additional astrometric check sources , also selected from @xcite , were included to quantify the observed astrometric accuracy .",
    "table  1 lists all phase calibrators and check sources used .",
    "each source , whether a gb6 variable , a phase calibrator , or an astrometric check source , was scheduled in 2-minute observations .",
    "separate observations were needed to acquire 4.5351 and 4.8851  ghz simultaneously , and 8.1149 and 8.4851  ghz simultaneously . allowing for telescope drive and electronics settling time",
    ", this gives about 1 to 1.5  minutes of integration time per observation per source .",
    "additional observations of j0137@xmath93309 ( 3c48 ) , j0521@xmath91638 ( 3c138 ) , j0542@xmath94951 ( 3c147 ) , and j1331@xmath93030 ( 3c286 ) were used to set the flux density scale to an accuracy of 3% and to fix electric - vector position angles to an accuracy of @xmath10 .",
    "instrumental polarizations were determined to an accuracy of 0.1% through observations of the phase calibrator sources j0359@xmath95057 , j0547@xmath92721 , j1928@xmath90848 , j1935@xmath92031 , j2007@xmath94029 , and j2322@xmath95057 .",
    "information on all stokes parameters was obtained at all four frequencies .",
    "this paper tabulates astrometric and photometric results for stokes @xmath11 only , and at the highest possible angular resolution at 8.4851  ghz .",
    "polarimetric and spectral information at matched , and lower , angular resolutions at all four frequencies will be presented elsewhere ( t.  e. clarke , in preparation ) .",
    "the gb6 variables were observed at _ a priori _ positions taken from , in order of preference , the vlba correlator database , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "all data were calibrated using the 1999 october 15 release of the nrao aips software .",
    "the 1999 december 31 release of aips was used to image all phase calibrators , astrometric check sources , and gb6 variables .",
    "the data were handled as described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , an automatic script was employed which first located the source by making a large image with a field of view @xmath12 , from which the source position was obtained by fitting a quadratic to the brightest component using the program maxfit . if the fitted peak was less than 40  mjy per beam area ( mjy / b ) , then the procedure was halted and the source was abandoned from further analysis .",
    "this 40-mjy filter passed all phase calibrators and check sources but only 30 of the gb6 variables .",
    "the automatic script next determined the source structure , by performing two iterations of phase only self - calibration and imaging .",
    "the final cleaned images of stokes @xmath11 were convolved with a gaussian of 200  mas fwhm and used to derive a total flux density @xmath13 , a peak flux density @xmath14 , and an rms noise level @xmath15 .",
    "the error in @xmath14 is the quadratic sum of a 3% amplitude error and @xmath15 . for one gb6 variable that passed the 40-mjy filter ,",
    "the vla pointing position was @xmath16 from the derived position and , because it is then difficult to distinguish source structure from delay smearing , that source was abandoned from this study .",
    "table  2 gives the astrometric and photometric results for the 29 gb6 variables that survived the automatic script and its quality control .",
    "a code `` nvss '' in the notes for 25 gb6 variables means that the _ a priori _ observed position was from @xcite and the position in table  2 was derived from the script prior to self - calibration .",
    "a code `` icrf '' in the notes for 4 gb6 variables means that the _ a priori _ observed position was from the vlba correlator database and the position in table  2 is from that database . for these 4 gb6 variables and the 5 astrometric check sources in table  1 ,",
    "the positions derived with the script can be compared to those from the vlba correlator database .",
    "this comparison leads to a standard deviation in right ascension of about 4  mas and in declination of about 9  mas , which when combined in quadrature give a 2-dimensional astrometric error of about 10  mas .",
    "only a few of the gb6 variables show interesting structure at 200-mas resolution ( figure  2 ) .",
    "each compact source in the jvas lists ( a ) has a peak flux density at 8.4  ghz @xmath1 50  mjy at a resolution of 200  mas ; ( b ) contains 80% or more of the total source flux density ; and ( c ) has a position known to an rms accuracy of 12@xmath255  mas @xcite .",
    "each gb6 variable in table  2 has very similar properties : it is a compact source with ( a ) a peak flux density at 8.5  ghz @xmath1 40  mjy ; ( b ) 80% or more of the total source flux density ; and ( c ) a position now known to an rms accuracy of about 10  mas ( 25 sources ) or less ( 4 sources ) .",
    "these gb6 variables therefore effectively extend the jvas lists of compact sources into the zone of avoidance at galactic latitudes @xmath17 .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , these gb6 sources can be considered as candidate phase calibrators for the vlba , thereby improving the prospects for vlba phase - referencing of galactic targets .",
    "second , the addition of these gb6 sources to the jvas lists strengthens the lists usefulness for studies of the galactic interstellar medium , including scintillation ( eg , cordes & rickett 1998 ) , angular broadening ( eg , desai & fey 2001 ) , faraday rotation ( eg , wrobel 1993 ) , and both molecular and atomic absorption ( eg , liszt & lucas 1998 ) .    the authors thank dr .  c. walker for comments on the manuscript and dr .",
