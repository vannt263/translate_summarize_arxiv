    "<S> our results establish the limits of quantum communication with arbitrary systems and set the most general and precise benchmarks for testing quantum repeaters in both discrete- and continuous - variable settings .    today </S>",
    "<S> s quantum technologies are the subject of an increasing interest by the scientific community , and represent one the biggest investments of research funding bodies . </S>",
    "<S> the promise of reliable and completely secure quantum communications  @xcite is an appealing alternative to the present classical infrastructure . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of developing a quantum internet  @xcite , which might lead to a world - wide architecture for distributed quantum processing , is attracting huge efforts from different fields , such as quantum optics and condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> hybrid solutions based on different substrates and technologies are considered the best strategies in this direction  @xcite .    however , the problem is that quantum information is generally more fragile than its classical counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> exotic quantum features may be rapidly washed away by the inevitable interactions with the external environment . </S>",
    "<S> noise and decoherence may greatly limit the performances of the various quantum protocols , as quantified by their optimal rates for transmitting quantum information , entanglement or secret correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this is an underlying limitation which potentially affect any direct quantum communication between two parties , say alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason one needs to consider quantum repeaters  @xcite , i.e. , intermediate relay stations which are meant to assist any point - to - point implementation .    </S>",
    "<S> this work is directly addressed to the core of this problem . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the optimal rates which are achievable for quantum communication ( qc ) , entanglement distillation  ( ed ) or quantum key distribution ( qkd ) between two parties , who can exploit unlimited two - way classical communication ( cc ) and adaptive local operations ( los ) , also known as adaptive loccs . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the two parties are directly connected by a quantum channel and they do not pre - share any entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation , we study the various two - way assisted capacities of the channel for qc , ed and qkd which set the ultimate limits achievable in the absence of repeaters .    by applying a technique of teleportation stretching  @xcite to suitable stretchable  channels in arbitrary dimension , we are able to greatly reduce the complexity of any quantum protocol based on adaptive loccs . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a simple protocol where each transmission through the channel is replaced by a choi matrix , and the adaptive loccs are all collapsed into a single final locc . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to bound the optimal rates for qc , ed and qkd by a single quantity , that we call entanglement flux  and represents the maximum entanglement that may survive the channel . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is computed for an arbitrary single - mode gaussian channel ( extending the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and for several discrete - variable channels , including all qubit pauli channels .    by showing coincidence with lower bounds , </S>",
    "<S> we prove a number of exact formulas . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the two - way assisted quantum capacity @xmath0 and the secret - key capacity @xmath1  of the quantum - limited amplifier are @xmath2 $ ] where @xmath3 is the gain . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the qubit dephasing channel has two - way assisted capacities @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the binary shannon entropy and @xmath6 is the dephasing probability . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend this result to arbitrary dimension .  </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also determine the secret - key capacity of the qubit erasure channel , which is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to mention that , before our study , the only two - way assisted capacities that were known were those ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) of the pure - loss channel  @xcite and @xmath0 of the erasure channel  @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> suppose that alice and bob are separated by a quantum channel @xmath8 and they want to implement the most general protocol assisted by adaptive loccs , with the aim of distributing entanglement , quantum information or secret keys . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that alice and bob have countable sets of systems , denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the first step is the preparation of the initial state of @xmath9 and @xmath10 by locc @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> next , alice picks a system @xmath12 which is sent through the channel @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> once bob gets the output @xmath13 , the parties apply locc @xmath14 on all systems @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> let us update bob s set by including @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in the second transmission , alice sends another system @xmath17 through @xmath8 resulting into an output @xmath18 for bob . </S>",
    "<S> the parties apply further locc @xmath19  on all systems @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> bob s set is updated and so on . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath21 transmissions , alice and bob will share a state @xmath22 depending on the sequence of adaptive loccs @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> this adaptive protocol has a rate of @xmath24 if @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the trace norm and @xmath27 is a target state with @xmath28 bits . if the parties implement entanglement distillation ( ed ) , the target state is a maximally - entangled state and @xmath29 is the number of entanglement bits ( ebit ) per use . </S>",
    "<S> if the parties implement qkd , the target state is a private state  @xcite with secret - key rate @xmath30  @xcite . by taking the limit of @xmath31  and optimizing over all the protocols @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> , one can define the two - way entanglement distillation capacity @xmath33 and the secret - key capacity @xmath1 of the channel as follows@xmath34    note that an ebit can teleport a qubit and a qubit can distribute an ebit : these processes are fully equivalent in the presence of unlimited two - way ccs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath35 coincides with the two - way quantum capacity @xmath36 of the channel . </S>",

    "<S> these quantities not only are computable but , thanks to the hashing inequality  @xcite , they represent achievable rates for one - way entanglement distillation and , therefore , are lower bounds of @xmath35 .    from above we may resort to the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree )  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these are the generators of a finite - dimensional weyl - heisenberg group or pauli group ( see methods ) . for a bosonic system ( @xmath50 ) , the set @xmath45 is composed by displacement operators @xmath48 with complex @xmath51  @xcite , which form the infinite - dimensional weyl - heisenberg group .  by definition , we say that a quantum channel @xmath8 is stretchable  by teleportation  if , for any @xmath52 and any input state @xmath40 , we may write@xmath53 for some unitary @xmath54 .    typically , the condition of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ stretch ] ) is satisfied with @xmath55 , i.e. , the channel is covariant with the weyl - heisenberg group . </S>",
    "<S> all qubit pauli channels are stretchable , because pauli operators commute or anticommute one with each other . </S>",
    "<S> then , all bosonic gaussian channels are stretchable since they linearly transform the quadratures , so that input displacements are mapped into output ones . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , there exist channels which are not stretchable , an example being the amplitude damping channel  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum communication over a stretchable channel can be greatly simplified . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the previous adaptive protocol can be suitably stretched  in time and reduced into a non - adaptive protocol where channels are replaced by their choi matrices and the adaptive loccs are collapsed into a single final locc . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible by introducing , before each use of the channel , an ideal teleportation circuit which is composed by an ideal epr source , i.e. , a maximally - entangled state , and a corresponding bell detection . </S>",
    "<S> the whole process is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , an adaptive protocol over @xmath21 uses of a stretchable channel @xmath8 reduces to @xmath21 choi matrices @xmath56 plus a trace - preserving locc @xmath57 , i.e. , the output reads@xmath58 this reduction of the output state greatly simplifies the computation of any entanglement measure which is non - increasing under trace - preserving locc and subadditive on tensor products . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the case of the ree , for which we may write @xmath59 . by replacing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hard ] ) , we obtain @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , let us define the entanglement flux @xmath61 of a channel @xmath8 as the ree of its choi matrix , i.e. , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> for a stretchable channel , this quantity represents the maximum amount of entanglement ( as quantified by the ree )  which can be distributed through the channel by means of adaptive protocols , i.e. , @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly zero for an entanglement - breaking channel , while it is maximum for the identity channel @xmath63 , for which @xmath64 with @xmath46 being the dimension of the hilbert space ( unbounded for cvs ) . by combining all previous results </S>",
    "<S> , we have that the two - way assisted capacities of a stretchable channel @xmath8 are upperbounded by its entanglement flux , i.e. , @xmath65    note that the entanglement flux is convex with respect to compositions of quantum channels . in other words , for any mean channel @xmath66 , defined for an ensemble of channels @xmath67 , we may write@xmath68 in particular , for ensembles of stretchable channels , the mean channel @xmath69 is also stretchable . thus , combining eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqtheo ] ) and  ( [ convex ] ) , one has an upper bound for the two - way assisted capacities of @xmath69 .      </S>",
    "<S> we can now investigate the ultimate rates of quantum communication and secret key generation over the most important channels . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider here all single - mode gaussian channels in canonical form  @xcite , extending the analysis of ref .  </S>",
