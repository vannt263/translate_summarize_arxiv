    "the spacetimes of interest here have an inner boundary @xmath28 at an _ isolated horizon _ @xcite .",
    "such horizons have the key features of a killing horizon in a stationary spacetime needed to establish the laws of black hole mechanics , but do not demand global symmetry .",
    "let us collect a few facts from the precise definition that will be useful below .",
    "an isolated horizon @xmath28 is a null surface with topology @xmath29 and a preferred null normal @xmath30 fixed up to scaling by a _",
    "constant_. in addition , @xmath28 admits a preferred foliation by 2-spheres @xmath31 , with @xmath32 real , called its `` good cuts '' in analogy with null infinity @xcite .",
    "the only attribute of this geometrically preferred foliation we need below is merely that it exists .",
    "we partially gauge fix the frame field @xmath4 at the horizon by fixing an internal null tetrad field @xmath33 there and demanding @xmath34 where the arrow denotes the pullback to @xmath28 , @xmath35 is the normal to @xmath31 within @xmath28 such that @xmath36 , and the proportionalities are _ constant _ over the horizon . in the covariant phase space framework below , we will restrict attention to cauchy surfaces @xmath15 that intersect @xmath28 in leaves @xmath31 of its preferred foliation . when the time gauge condition described above is also imposed , we will further restrict the choice of the internal null tetrad at the horizon such that @xmath37 is a fixed , unit space - like vector orthogonal to @xmath19 in the internal space . according to the definitions above ,",
    "@xmath38 is the unit normal to the inner boundary @xmath31 of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the only _ local _ internal gauge freedom remaining in the frame field @xmath4 are the _ spin transformations _ described by @xmath39 and its complex conjugate .",
    "this reduces the internal gauge group to @xmath3 at the horizon .    the null congruence generated by @xmath30",
    "is required to be expansion- and shear - free .",
    "this implies that there exist 1-form fields @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 intrinsic to @xmath28 such that @xmath43 of the three , only @xmath41 is complex . under the local spin transformations described above , @xmath40 is invariant , @xmath41 changes phase locally , and @xmath42 transforms as a @xmath3 connection .",
    "in fact , @xmath42 is just the intrinsic spin connection form on @xmath31 . taking another derivative of ( [ vkptdef ] ) leads to @xmath44\\label{vtcur }      { \\mathrm{d}}\\vartheta     & = \\bigl ( r_{abcd}\\ , \\bar m^a\\ , m^b\\ , \\bar m^c\\ , m^d \\bigr)\\ , \\epsilon                        & & = : \\bigl ( 2 \\operatorname{re}\\psi_2 - m^a\\ , \\bar m^b\\ , r_{ab } - \\tfrac{1}{6 } r \\bigr)\\ , \\epsilon = -\\tfrac{1}{2 } { \\mathcal{r}}\\ , \\epsilon,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the area element and _ intrinsic _ scalar curvature on @xmath31 , respectively , and the newman ",
    "penrose scalar @xmath47 may be evaluated in _ any _ null tetrad containing @xmath30 .",
    "finally , ( [ vkptdef ] ) shows that the flow generated by @xmath30 preserves the ( degenerate ) metric @xmath48 induced on @xmath28 .",
    "this metric symmetry is required to extend to the horizon connection , whence @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 all vanish .",
    "a spacetime @xmath6 with inner boundary @xmath28 admits only _ partial _ cauchy surfaces @xmath15 , which terminate at their intersections @xmath52 with that boundary .",
    "although the symplectic current ( [ curmod ] ) remains closed , its integrals over a pair of partial cauchy surfaces @xmath53 generally differ by its integral over the region of @xmath28 between their inner boundaries @xmath54 .",
    "if , however , the pullback @xmath55 to @xmath28 is an exact exterior derivative , say @xmath56 , then the integral over @xmath28 reduces to a difference of integrals over @xmath54 .",
    "it follows that @xmath57 has the same value for any two partial cauchy slices @xmath53 .",
    "the sign in the second term , the _ surface symplectic structure _ , arises because the orientation of @xmath54 as the inner boundary of @xmath53 assumed here is opposite to its orientation as the boundary of a portion of @xmath28 .",
    "our phase space consists of spacetimes @xmath6 that ( a ) contain a single isolated horizon @xmath28 as their inner boundary , with ( b ) a fixed , but arbitrary , total area @xmath1 . finally , as mentioned in the previous section , we also restrict ( c ) to partial cauchy surfaces @xmath53 whose inner boundaries @xmath54 are leaves @xmath31 of the preferred foliation ( _ i.e. _ , `` good cuts '' ) of @xmath28 .",
    "then , the pullback @xmath58 to @xmath28 has the form @xcite @xmath59 } \\varpi          + \\frac{1}{4\\pi g \\beta}\\ , \\delta_{[1 } \\epsilon \\wedge \\delta_{2 ] } \\vartheta.\\ ] ] moreover , the first term here is exact and the resulting integrals over @xmath54 vanish due to the restrictions ( b ) and ( c ) above .",
    "the second term in ( [ pbmod2 ] ) simplifies if we introduce a _ curvature potential _",
    "@xmath60 on @xmath31 such that @xmath61 here , @xmath62 denotes the hodge laplacian , @xmath63 the hodge dual , @xmath46 the scalar curvature , all intrinsic to @xmath31 , and @xmath64 denotes an average over @xmath31 .",
    "that is , @xmath64 is the integral of @xmath65 over @xmath31 divided by @xmath1 .",
    "the averaged term on the right side of the first equation is necessary for @xmath60 to exist , while the second condition makes @xmath60 unique .",
    "we then define @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the inverse metric on @xmath31 .",
    "the factor of one half here helps to compare to a connection defined in @xcite , also denoted @xmath68 .",
    "note , however , that ( [ rvtdef ] ) defines @xmath68 on _ any _ horizon , regardless of symmetry .",
    "also note that the second term in ( [ rvtdef ] ) is invariant under local spin transformations of @xmath69 since @xmath60 arises directly from the metric .",
    "it follows that @xmath68 transforms like a @xmath3 connection , albeit with half the weight of @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , ( [ vtcur ] ) gives @xmath71 where the double arrow in the last expression denotes the pullback to @xmath52 and @xmath72 is introduced in ( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "note that the area _ element _",
    "on @xmath52 is naturally a _",
    "pseudo_-form , whereas the final expression in ( [ rvtcur ] ) , which we call the _ area flux _",
    "below , is naturally a form .",
    "the left side is certainly a form , so there is already a reason at the classical level to prefer the area flux to the area element in this expression .",
    "this becomes a crucial distinction in the quantum theory .",
    "contracting @xmath30 with ( [ rvtdef ] ) causes the second term on the right to vanish .",
    "this determines the only component of @xmath42 that enters ( [ pbmod2 ] ) in terms of @xmath73 .",
    "together , these observations yield @xmath74 } \\vartheta          = \\delta_{[1 } \\biggl(-\\frac{4}{{\\ifx\\relax\\relax\\langle\\else\\mathopen\\relax\\langle\\fi { \\mathcal{r}}\\ifx\\relax\\relax\\rangle\\else\\mathclose\\relax\\rangle\\fi } } \\ , { \\mathrm{d}}\\ring v \\biggr)\\wedge          \\delta_{2 ] } \\bigl(2\\ring v\\bigr )          = - \\frac{4}{{\\ifx\\relax\\relax\\langle\\else\\mathopen\\relax\\langle\\fi { \\mathcal{r}}\\ifx\\relax\\relax\\rangle\\else\\mathclose\\relax\\rangle\\fi}}\\ , { \\mathrm{d}}(\\delta_1 \\ring v \\wedge \\delta_2 \\ring v).\\ ] ] with @xmath1 fixed , @xmath75 is a _ topological _",
    "invariant by the gauss  bonnet theorem .",
    "it therefore passes through the variation to give the above equation .    substituting ( [ pbbar ] ) into ( [ pbmod2 ] ) , and the result into ( [ bsint ] )",

    "this result has precisely the general form found in symmetric cases @xcite , but holds throughout the _ full _ classical phase space of _ all _ isolated horizons with area @xmath1 .",
    "this full classical phase space contains subspaces corresponding to the symmetric cases studied previously .",
    "we check that ( [ curint ] ) reproduces the known symplectic structures on those subspaces by solving ( [ cpdef ] ) explicitly .",
    "this is immediate in spherical symmetry , where @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that @xmath80 and , indeed , the spherically symmetric symplectic structure includes a chern  simons horizon term for precisely this part of the physical spin connection @xcite . in axisymmetry , we work in the canonical coordinates @xmath81 of @xcite , which generalize the coordinates @xmath82 on a round sphere .",
    "the potential @xmath60 itself is axisymmetric in this case , and ( [ cpdef ] ) becomes @xmath83 where primes denote derivatives and @xmath84 is the squared norm of the axial killing field @xmath85 .",
    "the constant of integration in the first integral of this expression must vanish to avoid logarithmic singularities in @xmath86 at the poles where @xmath87 vanishes .",
    "thus , we find @xmath88 this is precisely the axisymmetric formula @xcite .",
    "all previous expressions of the horizon symplectic structure therefore represent _ pullbacks _ of ( [ curint ] ) to subspaces of the full phase space of all horizons .",
    "the symplectic structure ( [ curint ] ) is almost identical to that studied in @xcite .",
    "the only actual difference is that its horizon term involves @xmath68 instead of @xmath89 .",
    "we now argue that in fact _ all _ elements of the classical framework necessary for quantization in @xcite are also present here .",
    "moreover , the only element _ not _ present , the restriction to round horizon geometries , was never truly incorporated at the quantum level in @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we claim that the quantization described in detail in @xcite is properly viewed as that of the _ full _ phase space of generic isolated horizons defined in this paper .",
    "let us proceed by first recalling the key steps of the detailed quantization , confirming that each remains viable here .",
    "the sum of bulk and surface terms in the the classical symplectic structure ( [ curint ] ) suggests that initially the hilbert space of the quantum theory should be a tensor product @xmath90 of bulk and surface factors .",
    "these consist of suitable functions of a generalized @xmath2 connection on @xmath15 , usually denoted @xmath91 , and of a generalized @xmath3 connection on @xmath52 , which we shall denote @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "we use the non - prejudicial notation @xmath92 for the quantum @xmath3 chern  simons connection to emphasize a point .",
    "namely , we mean to expropriate the key results of @xcite , but the _ classical _ horizon connection @xmath68 we use here is certainly _ not _ the same as the intrinsic spin connection @xmath89 on the horizon used there .",
    "we call the quantum horizon connection @xmath92 at this stage to emphasize that it currently has no interpretation in terms of _ spatial geometry_. indeed , @xmath93 is simply a tensor product in which the surface and bulk components of a state are fully independent , and _ all _ operators encoding the spatial geometry are already represented on @xmath94 alone .",
    "we now recall how the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom become related in the quantum theory . already in the classical theory ,",
    "@xmath68 may be characterized as the unique @xmath3 connection on @xmath52 whose holonomy along a given oriented loop @xmath95 is @xmath96 : = \\exp \\oint_c { \\mathrm{i}}\\ring v          = \\exp \\biggl ( -\\frac{2\\pi{\\mathrm{i}}}{{\\relax{a}_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mspace{-2mu}\\delta } } } \\int_{\\operatorname{int}c } \\sigma_i\\ , r^i \\biggr),\\ ] ] the _ interior _ @xmath97 being selected by the orientation @xmath52 .",
    "this formula , or its infinitesimal version ( [ rvtcur ] ) , shows that the _ gauge - invariant part _ of @xmath68 is _ completely _ and _ locally _ determined by the frame field at @xmath52 .",
    "that is , even though inverting the laplacian in ( [ cpdef ] ) renders @xmath68 in ( [ rvtdef ] ) _ non - local _ in the geometric spin connection @xmath89 intrinsic to @xmath52 , its gauge - invariant content is nonetheless _ locally _ determined by the full set of basic variables of the theory .",
    "note that @xmath68 is local in @xmath89 if and only if the horizon is spherically symmetric , and then the two are equal .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space @xmath98 arises in the present case by elevating ( [ rvthol ] ) to an operator equation on @xmath93 , the two sides acting in different factors of the tensor product .",
    "this defines the _ quantum horizon boundary condition _",
    "@xmath99          = \\exp \\biggl ( - \\frac{2\\pi{\\mathrm{i}}}{{\\relax{a}_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mspace{-2mu}\\delta}}}\\ , \\hat\\sigma[\\operatorname{int}c , r ] \\biggr ) \\otimes \\hat i_{\\mathrm{s}},\\ ] ] which plays two pivotal roles in the quantization .",
    "first , it fixes the chern ",
    "simons boundary state in @xmath100 in terms of data on edges that terminate at @xmath52 in a given spin network state in @xmath94 .",
    "thus , just as ( [ rvthol ] ) dictates @xmath68 classically in terms of the bulk variables , so the quantum bulk state dictates the quantum boundary state .",
    "second , ( [ qhbc ] ) links ( quantum ) @xmath3 gauge transformations in @xmath100 to @xmath2 gauge transformations in @xmath94 that preserve the internal direction @xmath72 at @xmath52 .",
    "this guarantees gauge invariance of the overall state .",
    "again , there is a classical antecedent in that such a bulk gauge transformation dictates a @xmath3 gauge transformation of @xmath70 , and thus of @xmath68 in ( [ rvtdef ] ) .",
    "in addition to fixing the boundary state in terms of the bulk state , imposing ( [ qhbc ] ) in @xmath93 does restrict the bulk state itself , but only slightly .",
    "in particular , the bulk state must lie in the subspace of @xmath94 spanned by eigenstates of @xmath101 $ ] whose eigenvalues are integer multiples of @xmath1 .",
    "these are spin network states that satisfy @xmath102 where @xmath103 runs over the horizon punctures .",
    "this ensures that holonomies of the @xmath3 connection @xmath92 are defined consistently in the quantum chern ",
    "simons theory in the sense that reversing the orientation @xmath104 of the loop replaces the holonomy on the left side of ( [ qhbc ] ) with its hermitian adjoint .    solving the diffeomorphism constraint for generic horizons",
    "proceeds exactly as described in @xcite .",
    "both the definition ( [ cpdef ] ) of @xmath60 and thus the definition ( [ rvtdef ] ) of @xmath68 are manifestly diffeomorphism covariant .",
    "thus , a bulk diffeomorphism preserving @xmath52 induces the same transformation of @xmath68 on a generic horizon that it does of @xmath89 in spherical symmetry .",
    "the passage to the hilbert space @xmath105 of solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint is therefore unchanged .",
    "the subsequent passage to the physical hilbert space @xmath106 of solutions of the hamiltonian constraint is even simpler because , as in @xcite , the lapse function must vanish at @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting constraints do not affect surface states .",
    "we now make the case that @xmath106 , as constructed in @xcite , does not incorporate spherical symmetry .",
    "we first mention a simple , but heuristic , argument based on the central result of @xcite , that @xmath106 supports an ensemble of states with ( horizon ) entropy @xmath0 .",
    "this diverges as @xmath107 , implying that @xmath106 comprises infinitely many semi - classical horizon states .",
    "in contrast , the phase space of spherically symmetric horizons includes , modulo diffeomorphisms , exactly one such state .",
    "thus , it appears that @xmath106 contains semi - classical states describing non - spherical horizons .",
    "now let s consider the question in the full quantum theory , not just in its semi - classical limit .",
    "classically , spherical symmetry restricts not only the @xmath3 horizon connection , but also the _ bulk _ frame field at every point of the horizon surface , anticipating a similar _ local _ restriction of the bulk quantum state .",
    "but the only such restriction , beyond the usual diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints , is ( [ csrev ] ) . this single , _",
    "global _ restriction is nothing like a _ local _ , classical symmetry condition .",
    "a definitive resolution of the matter would begin with a detailed study of the operators on @xmath98 corresponding to the classical bulk degrees of freedom constrained by spherical symmetry .",
    "these are the flux operators @xmath108 , the quantum analogues of the classical triad @xmath109 .",
    "the next section is devoted to this issue .",
    "we conclude this section with a comment .",
    "as emphasized above , the quantum @xmath3 chern  simons connection @xmath92 is unrelated to spatial geometry in @xmath93 .",
    "it is _ only _ the quantum horizon boundary condition ( [ qhbc ] ) that gives @xmath92 its physical interpretation . because that operator equation mirrors ( [ rvthol ] ) , the quantum theory _ forces _ us to interpret @xmath92 as nothing but the quantum analogue of the `` area flux connection '' @xmath68 .",
    "that is , the quantum horizon boundary condition ( [ qhbc ] ) is identical to that in @xcite , and one may consider ( [ rvthol ] ) its proper classical antecedent .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath92 can not be considered a quantum analogue of the classical spin connection on the horizon , and its holonomies do not generally measure quantum deficit angles .",
    "the preceding section has argued that the kinematical hilbert space @xmath98 constructed in @xcite actually describes _ all _ isolated horizons , regardless of shape .",
    "this section explores how , in principle , one would go about measuring the quantum geometry of the horizon surface in a particular quantum state in @xmath98 .",
    "these comments further clarify our claim that no symmetry is present quantum mechanically .",
    "quite generally in loop quantum gravity , the geometrical content of states is measured using the smeared flux operators @xmath110 : = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 } \\sum_{x \\in t } f^i(x ) \\sum_{e { \\text { at } } x } \\kappa(t , e)\\ , \\hat j^{(x , e)}_i,\\ ] ] where is a @xmath111 transversely oriented 2-surface in @xmath15 and the sums are over all points @xmath112 of @xmath111 and all analytic curves @xmath113 extending from each @xmath112 .",
    "the classical analogues of these operators are integrals of the smeared flux @xmath114 over @xmath111 .",
    "we define all three factors in the summand of ( [ fluxop ] ) exactly as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath115 generates either left- or right - translations , depending on whether @xmath113 starts or ends at @xmath112 , of the generalized holonomy of the ashtekar ",
    "barbero connection along @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , @xmath116 vanishes if @xmath113 does not intersect or lies entirely within @xmath111 , and is @xmath117 if @xmath113 extends either above or below @xmath111 in the transverse orientation of the surface , respectively . finally , @xmath118 is simply a smearing function and the factor on the left arises from the coefficient of the bulk term in the symplectic structure ( [ curint ] ) . when acting on a spin network state , ( [ fluxop ] )",
    "reduces to a finite sum over vertices and edges in the network .",
    "the fluxes ( [ fluxop ] ) are naturally conjugate to the @xmath2 holonomy operators @xmath119 $ ] of the generalized ashtekar  barbero connection .",
    "after quantization , however , @xcite consider holonomies only along curves @xmath95 _ transverse _ to @xmath52 , and thus only spin network states without edges tangent to the horizon .",
    "the rationale for this is evident classically , where the pullback to @xmath52 of the extrinsic curvature @xmath120 of @xmath15 is @xmath121\\ , \\ell^c\\ , r_c.\\ ] ] here , @xmath122 and @xmath123 denote the unit normal and extrinsic curvature of @xmath52 within @xmath15 , respectively , and @xmath41 is defined in ( [ vkptdef ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath123 is determined by the spin connection @xmath124 of the triad on @xmath15 .",
    "thus , only the transverse part @xmath125 of the ashtekar  barbero connection ( [ ipsbar ] ) retains degrees of freedom independent of the triad field at the horizon .",
    "it is therefore natural to restrict to curves whose holonomies probe those degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the _ pullback fluxes _",
    "@xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath111 is a region within the horizon surface @xmath52 , already provide natural conjugates to such _",
    "the algebra on @xmath94 of transverse holonomies and pullback fluxes at the horizon plays a central role in the quantization scheme .",
    "the point we wish to emphasize is that pullback fluxes and transverse holonomies form only _ part _ of the full operator algebra available at the horizon . even excluding tangential holonomies",
    ", there are fluxes @xmath126 $ ] through surfaces @xmath111 intersecting @xmath52 _ transversely _ to consider . in the classical theory ,",
    "such _ transverse fluxes _ reveal the _ intrinsic _ horizon geometry because the transverse component @xmath127 of the classical flux encodes the dyad on @xmath52 from which the horizon metric @xmath128 derives .",
    "in contrast , the pullback flux @xmath129 reveals only the classical area element , which roughly speaking gives only the determinant of @xmath128 .",
    "thus , transverse fluxes are essential to analyze the classical horizon geometry .",
    "it is also clear in the full quantum theory that pullback fluxes alone do not suffice to extract all information available at the horizon in a particular quantum state .",
    "the generators @xmath115 in the sum ( [ fluxop ] ) associated with different curves @xmath113 emanating from a given point @xmath112 of the horizon are _",
    "independent_. all of these generators contribute to a pullback flux @xmath130 $ ] with the same sign @xmath131 because @xmath52 is the boundary of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the pullback flux reveals only the _ sum _ of the @xmath115 over all @xmath113 at each @xmath112 , and not the generators individually .",
    "in contrast , a given @xmath113 may fall on either side of a transverse surface @xmath111 , and thus may enter ( [ fluxop ] ) with either sign .",
    "this flexibility allows one to recover generators from fluxes .",
    "the only way to recover all of the information probed by the generators is therefore to employ all of the fluxes at the horizon .    with this understanding of the operators available at the horizon",
    ", one can now imagine how in principle to explore its intrinsic quantum geometry .",
    "for example , the generators , or equivalently the transverse fluxes , should enable one to define operators corresponding to the lengths of curves within the horizon surface @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to write down such operators explicitly in this paper , nor to analyze the full operator algebra at the horizon in detail .",
    "rather , our purpose is merely to articulate a point of view that the _ intrinsic quantum geometry _ of the horizon inheres in a part of the operator algebra that heretofore has not been studied thoroughly in the literature , and which certainly is not explicitly constrained by symmetry at the quantum level in @xcite .",
    "let us conclude with two comments .",
    "first , the transverse flux operators highlighted above _ already exist _ on @xmath98 in the standard quantization .",
    "the boundary conditions do not _ create _ , but rather _ eliminate _ , independent degrees of freedom at the horizon .",
    "the remaining data are parametrized using the fluxes and transverse holonomies .",
    "operators representing the tangential holonomies could in principle be constructed from these . in this sense ,",
    "all of the usual gravitational degrees of freedom at the horizon are represented on @xmath98 .",
    "second , the view of quantum horizon geometry adopted here is quite different from that in previous works . in particular",
    ", the operators used to describe quantum horizon geometry in @xcite are the area and the area flux , which are functions only of pullback fluxes .",
    "this is possible classically only if the shape of the horizon is fixed up to diffeomorphism using symmetry .",
    "we have argued that the symmetry does not persist after quantization and that , if the horizon shape is not fixed classically , then it is expressed in the _ transverse _ fluxes .",
    "finally , we have shown explicitly that the quantum analogues @xmath132 $ ] of the transverse fluxes are independent of the pullback fluxes @xmath130 $ ] as operators on @xmath98 . taken together ,",
    "these facts indicate the need for a broader interpretation of intrinsic quantum horizon geometry not based purely on pullback fluxes .",
    "our proposal is essentially to use the standard formulation of loop quantum geometry in terms of _ all _ fluxes available at the horizon .",
    "quite generally , the entropy of a physical system depends on one or more macroscopic parameters . fixing values of these parameters determines a microcanonical ensemble of states in which the corresponding macroscopic observables take those values .",
    "this ensemble typically contains many states that differ in microscopic details , but give the same desired macroscopic results .",
    "the entropy for given parameter values is a measure of how many states are in the ensemble .",
    "we emphasize these points to contrast an interpretation of the entropy calculation @xcite advocated below with that previously ascribed to it in @xcite . to be clear ,",
    "we propose no modification to the detailed mathematical calculation , only to its physical interpretation . at issue",
    "is the number and nature of parameters used to select the ensemble .",
    "physically , the ensemble certainly ought to fix the total horizon area and perhaps a few other macroscopic charges of the black hole . but",
    "this is not what is done in @xcite .",
    "the situation is clearest in the axisymmetric case @xcite , where the ensemble ostensibly fixes the horizon area as well as an _ infinite _ collection of certain multipole moments @xcite of its geometry .",
    "classically , the complete collection of multipole moments characterize an axisymmetric horizon geometry up to diffeomorphism , fixing details of that geometry down to the very shortest length scales .",
    "there is nothing _ _",
    "macro__scopic about fixing _ all _ of the multipole moments .",
    "the situation is less transparent in spherical symmetry because @xcite do not _",
    "explicitly _ restrict the ensemble .",
    "rather , it is held ( erroneously in our view ) that @xmath106 describes nothing but round horizons , and thus the ensemble as well .",
    "but again , asserting the symmetry classically at all length scales clearly fixes degrees of freedom that physically can only be considered _ _ micro__scopic .",
    "we have argued above that the hilbert space @xmath106 defined in @xcite is properly interpreted to comprise quantum states corresponding to _ all _ horizons of total area @xmath1 , regardless of shape . under this interpretation",
    ", there is no obstacle to defining an ensemble of states within @xmath106 fixing only the manifestly _ _",
    "macro__scopic parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this ensemble happens to coincide precisely with that defined in @xcite .",
    "it contains all eigenstates of the total area operator @xmath133 whose eigenvalues are within a certain tolerance @xmath134 of the classical value @xmath1 prior to quantization .",
    "the horizon entropy arises by counting just the distinct surface states in this ensemble because the bulk states describe field excitations elsewhere in spacetime .",
    "intuitively , the entropy in this interpretation measures the variety of _ shapes _ a horizon with given area @xmath1 may have .",
    "moreover , quantization _ cuts off _ geometric degrees of freedom in this interpretation , rather than appearing to multiply them .",
    "more precisely , the interpretation of @xcite holds that quantizing a phase space comprising ( up to diffeomorphism ) a single horizon state , wherein any reasonable horizon entropy ought to vanish , yields a hilbert space in which the entropy is non - zero .",
    "in contrast , our interpretation holds that quantizing a phase space comprising a continuous infinity of horizon geometries , wherein the entropy ought to diverge , yields a hilbert space in which the entropy is finite .",
    "the latter interpretation is of course quite common in quantum mechanics , with historical roots going back to the very foundation of the theory .",
    "this discussion has sidestepped the important issue of how the horizon states are actually to be counted .",
    "the literature contains ( at least ) two schemes for doing this , and in principle our proposal is compatible with both .",
    "one scheme , the one adopted in @xcite , counts exactly the states of the @xmath3 chern ",
    "simons theory .",
    "this is sometimes called _ @xmath135-counting _ because it counts distinct labelings by magnetic quantum numbers ( _ i.e. _ , pullback fluxes ) of the horizon punctures . the alternative , called _ @xmath136-counting _",
    "@xcite , is to count distinct labelings of the punctures by both spin _ and _ magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "the two schemes differ only in the value of the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter they select @xcite , and it is not clear which one is `` correct . ''",
    "the inclusion of generic isolated horizons achieved here adds nothing to this discussion .",
    "however , we do remark that this question seems connected to recent efforts @xcite to quantize isolated horizons without reducing the @xmath2 gauge to @xmath3 at the horizon .",
    "at the classical level , the key technical result of this paper is that the symplectic structure ( [ curint ] ) is conserved on the _ full _ phase space of _ all _ isolated horizons of area @xmath1 .",
    "the proof depends critically on the definition ( [ rvtdef ] ) of a new @xmath3 connection @xmath68 on the horizon .",
    "it is worthwhile to note two things about this definition .",
    "first , @xmath68 yields a chern ",
    "simons surface symplectic structure ( [ curint ] ) not only on the phase space of horizons of a fixed , but arbitrary , shape , but permits one to fit all of those phase spaces together into a single , overall phase space in which the shape may vary .",
    "this is a stark contrast to past work @xcite , wherein the horizon shape had to be fixed classically in order to construct a conserved symplectic structure .",
    "second , the formula ( [ rvthol ] ) for the classical holonomies of @xmath68 parallels _ exactly _ the quantum horizon boundary condition ( [ qhbc ] ) at the heart of the seminal quantization @xcite of isolated horizons .",
    "one could say that the importance of an `` area flux connection '' whose curvature is a flux that is _ conjugate _ to the usual ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski connection was first perceived in @xcite at the _ quantum _ level , and that what we have done here is to introduce a _ classical _ connection with the same geometric meaning on a general horizon .    at the quantum level",
    ", the key technical result of this paper is that each step of the detailed quantization @xcite of isolated horizons remains viable if it begins with the phase space of classical horizons of variable shape .",
    "this is surprising because it seems as though two phase spaces , one restricted to spherical symmetry and considerably smaller than the other , lead to identical hilbert spaces .",
    "however , one can see directly in the final quantum theory that the geometric degrees of freedom probed by fluxes at the horizon are not restricted beyond the usual constraints of general relativity .",
    "this would not be the case if symmetry were present .",
    "thus the symmetry present classically in @xcite was not reasserted after quantization and the final hilbert space properly corresponds to the _ full _ phase space in which all horizon shapes are included .",
    "indeed , arguably the key achievement of this paper has been precisely to introduce a classical framework that exactly matches the quantum framework in @xcite .",
    "these technical results shed new light on the calculation of black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity .",
    "neither the entropy calculation nor the predicted value(s ) of the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter change , but how one interprets the entropy physically does .",
    "namely , the absence of symmetry at the quantum level implies that the states being counted to find the entropy correspond to different quantum shapes of the horizon .",
    "this interpretation of the statistical entropy of black holes in loop quantum gravity strongly resembles familiar interpretations of more ordinary statistical mechanical systems .",
