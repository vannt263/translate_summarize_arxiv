    "the simple , nonrelativistic quark model ( qm ) gives a qualitatively good description of the baryon moments . under the assumption that each baryon is composed of three valence or constituent quarks in a state with all internal orbital angular momenta equal to zero ,",
    "the moments are given by expectation values of the spin moment operators @xmath8 leading to the standard expressions @xmath9 where the effective quark moments @xmath10 and @xmath3 can be treated as free parameters in attempting to fit the data .",
    "the predicted pattern of the signs for the moments agrees with observation .",
    "a least - squares fit to seven measured octet moments ( the transition moment @xmath11 is left to be predicted ) gives a root - mean - square deviation of theory from experiment of 0.12 @xmath5 , about 10% of the average magnitudes of the moments .",
    "agreement at this level can be regarded as an outstanding success of the quark model , but the deviations also give a very sensitive test of baryon structure .",
    "there is presently no completely successful first - principles theory of the moments .    in this paper , we approach the moment problem dynamically using a qcd - based quark model @xcite with meson loop corrections .",
    "the model has only three parameters , namely the quark moments @xmath10 and @xmath3 , and a parameter @xmath4 that characterizes the momentum scale of meson - baryon interactions , with the particles regarded as composite .",
    "we find that this approach reduces the average deviation of the calculated moments from experiment to @xmath12 , a substantial improvement , and that the loop corrections are small compared to the leading qm terms , suggesting reasonable convergence for the loop expansion .",
    "a different approach to the moment problem using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) with loop corrections has been studied recently by a number of authors .",
    "excellent fits to the data can be obtained for either conventional @xcite or a modified @xcite chiral counting . however , as pointed out elsewhere @xcite , the general fits are essentially independent of the dynamical input , and are best thought of as giving parametrizations of the data . in particular , the introduction of the counterterms needed to eliminate divergences in the loop integrals results in the appearance of five new chiral couplings @xcite at the one - loop level in addition to the two tree - level @xcite couplings .",
    "the seven well - measured octet moments can be fitted exactly using these seven parameters , whether or not the calculated loop corrections are included @xcite .",
    "the theory is only weakly predictive with respect to the remaining quantity , the @xmath13 transition moment , which is not known precisely .",
    "furthermore , the loop corrections in chpt are nearly as large as the tree - level terms , and convergence of the expansion is at best slow , when the divergences are regularized using dimensional regularization .",
    "this problem is not unexpected , since chiral symmetry is known to be badly broken for the baryons .",
    "the remaining predictions @xcite are sum rules that can be motivated by large @xmath14 expansions or expansions in the symmetry breaking mass parameter @xmath15 in chpt , but do not depend explicitly on the dynamics .",
    "our intent here is to present a dynamical approach to the baryon moments in which we emphasize the composite nature of the baryons and use a description based on the qm rather than the chiral picture .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "ii by reviewing briefly the derivation of the qm , with corrections , from qcd using a wilson - loop approach @xcite .",
    "the derivation involves the suppression of internal quark loops ( `` quenching '' ) , an approximation that is likely to account for the deficiencies of the resulting model .",
    "the addition of quark loops necessary to remove the quenching introduces meson loops when the theory is viewed at the hadron level @xcite , and the effect of these loops on the baryon moments must be considered .",
    "we develop our approach to loop effects in sec .",
    "iii , where we define the chiral couplings we will use for low momentum meson - baryon and electromagnetic interactions in a calculation based on heavy - baryon perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the form factor needed to account for the extended structure of the baryons and mesons viewed as composite particles .",
    "we present our final expression for the octet moments , the results of our numerical analysis , and our conclusions in sec .",
    "finally , we give the detailed results needed to evaluate the formal expressions for the moments in two appendices .",
    "in previous work @xcite , we analyzed the qm for the baryon moments in the context of qcd .",
    "our approach was based on the work of brambilla _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who derived the interaction potential and wave equation for the valence quarks in a baryon from qcd using a wilson - line construction .",
    "their basic idea was to construct a green s function for the propagation of a gauge - invariant combination of quarks joined by path ordered wilson - line factors @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the color gauge field .",
    "the wilson lines sweep out a three - sheeted world sheet of the form shown in fig.1 as the quarks move from their initial to their final configurations .    by making an expansion in powers of @xmath18 using the foldy - wouthuysen approximation , and considering only forward propagation of the quarks in time , brambilla _ et al .",
    "_ were able to derive a hamiltonian and schrdinger equation for the quarks , with an interaction which involves an average over the gauge field . that average was performed using the minimal surface approximation in which fluctuations in the world sheet are ignored , and the geometry",
    "is chosen to minimize the total area of the world sheet subject to the motion of the quarks .",

    "the full hamiltonian is given in @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian , including the terms omitted here , gives a good description of the baryon spectrum as shown by carlson , kogut , and pandharipande @xcite and by capstick and isgur @xcite , who proposed it on the basis of reasonable physical arguments , but did not give formal derivations from qcd .",
