    "( c ) the effective demagnetizing field @xmath22 ( normalized by @xmath59 ) vs soft phase content @xmath24 . ]    the effective demagnetizing field @xmath22 is presented in fig . [ fig5a_plot](c ) .",
    "as expected , with increasing soft phase content @xmath24 the magnitude of the internal field increases due to increase of a magnetic charge forming at the hard - soft boundary . as a consequence , the whole manifold @xmath150 displaces downward respective to @xmath180 .",
    "when the dipolar field increases there is some critical amount of the soft phase @xmath241 , beyond which a system with magnetic or structural nonhomogeneity would undergo the phase transition into another ground state with non - homogeneous distribution of the magnetization .",
    "we finally present the dependence of @xmath238 on the value of soft phase anisotropy parameter , @xmath55 .",
    "the presented range of @xmath55 is much larger than that is in real soft magnets and was chosen to demonstrate the character of scaling of @xmath238 with @xmath55 .",
    "this dependence is illustrated in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig5a_plot ] for small , @xmath239 , and large , @xmath240 , amount of soft phase .",
    "the spin gap demonstrates a linear dependence on @xmath55 , as long as @xmath242 .",
    "it suggest that the main mechanism in formation of low - energy spin excitations in composite magnets is the interplay of the anisotropy and exchange interaction , as in the case of pure exchange spin waves , @xmath243 .",
    "the role of the dipolar interaction amounts to shifting of the spin - wave manifold as a whole and is crucial in the vicinity of @xmath244 .",
    "this is the case for smco@xmath0/feco composite , where @xmath245 and , as we have shown above , the spin excitations are mostly concentrated in the soft phase .",
    "in this paper we studied the spin - wave spectra of two - phase ferromagnetic composites .",
    "hard phase cubes inserted into a soft phase matrix form a 3d structure of exchange - coupled hard and soft phases .",
    "in such a geometry there are regions where the saturation magnetization @xmath246 is perpendicular to the hard - soft boundary , which is energetically unfavorable from the magnetostatic point of view .",
    "we have found the corresponding spin wave excitations and magnon wave functions by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the harmonic approximation .",
    "we numerically found that low - lying excitations are mostly concentrated in the soft phase , which gives rise to considerable fluctuation of soft phase spins and a lack of the remanence enhancement with increasing of the soft phase amount .",
    "the spin wave frequencies strongly depend on the magnetic charges and magnetostatic interaction in the system .",
    "as it turns out the difference in the exchange coupling constants of hard and soft phase has little effect , if any , on the eigenmodes of the system .",
    "the energy of the lowest spin wave zone is mostly affected by the presence of the effective demagnetizing field in the composite and the value of anisotropy energy of the soft phase .",
    "finally , we have shown that with adding more soft phase the fully aligned spin state @xmath8 becomes unstable relative to excitation of long wavelength spin waves with wave vector @xmath115 parallel to the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition into another ground state characterized by misalignment of spins of hard and soft phases .",
    "we have found critical values of soft phase thickness @xmath241 .",

    "<S> the dipolar interaction splits the spin wave energies into the upper and lower branches of the spin wave manifold . when the amount of the soft phase is increased the energy of low - lying spin excitations is considerably softened due to two reasons : ( i ) the low- lying mode locked into the soft phase region with a spin wave gap at @xmath1 which scales approximately proportional to the anisotropy constant of the soft phase and ( ii ) the internal dipolar field which comes from magnetic charges forming at hard - soft boundaries with normals parallel to the magnetization displaces the spin wave manifold toward the lower energies . with adding more soft phase the spin wave gap closes and the system moves to another ground state characterized by the magnetization mismatch between spins of the hard and soft phases .    </S>",
