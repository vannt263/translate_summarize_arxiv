    "the discovery of high - t@xmath1 superconductors based on cuo - compounds @xcite has led to a large amount of theoretical work about the peculiar properties of these materials .",
    "a major effort has focussed on the normal - state properties of these compounds .",
    "this research was largely motivated and substantiated by experiments that revealed striking anomalies in the normal - state properties @xcite .",
    "most prominent among these are the linear resistivity , a linear nmr - relaxation of the cu - spins , and a hall angle that behaves @xmath2 over a rather wide temperature region .",
    "furthermore , the optical conductivity shows a drude peak with a width@xcite @xmath3 , consistent with the linearity of the resistivity , and a drude weight which grows linearly with doping , consistent with the notion of holes acting as the charge carriers .",
    "in addition , there is a pronounced temperature and doping dependent mid - ir peak at frequencies above the drude peak .",
    "it was argued from the beginning @xcite that most of these anomalous properties can be explained by two special features appearing simultaneously in these materials : ( i ) they are strongly correlated , i.e.  their ( effective ) local coulomb interaction is comparable to or larger than the characteristic kinetic energy of the relevant carriers ; and ( ii ) they are highly anisotropic with the electrons being in principle confined to the cuo - planes characteristic for these compounds .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the cuo planes can be accurately described by a planar single - band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the great interest in this class of materials has led to a number of new theoretical conjectures , that , although based on the assumption of strongly correlated carriers , focussed mainly on the 2d - character of the cuo - planes@xcite .    in two earlier publications@xcite",
    ", we found that several of these anomalies can be understood from a kondo - like effect in the infinite - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "in particular , the density of states develops a sharp peak at the fermi surface as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the development of this quasiparticle peak coincides with the screening of the effective local moments and anomalies in the transport .",
    "for example , the resistivity of the model displays a distinct linear in @xmath4 behavior with a slope that increases in inverse proportion to the doping @xmath5 , consistent with experiment@xcite .",
    "the nmr relaxation rate @xmath6 displays a pronounced linear in @xmath4 region , with a slope that increases with doping , also consistent with experiment@xcite .",
    "finally , the qualitative features of the hall resistivity are consistent with experiment@xcite , including a hall angle that increases quadratically with the temperature .",
    "recently , a sharp kondo - like peak at the fermi surface has also been seen in the two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite as the temperature is lowered .",
    "_ this suggests that these anomalous normal - state properties are intrinsic to the hubbard model , independent of dimensionality ! _    in this contribution , we address the anomalous normal - state properties of the hubbard - model optical conductivity .",
    "the optical conductivity @xmath7 is an important probe of the excitations of a strongly correlated system .",
    "it measures the rate at which electron - hole pairs are created by photons of frequency @xmath8 . in a perfect ( translationally invariant ) metal ,",
    "photons couple only to electron - hole pairs with vanishing momentum and energy ; @xmath9 is proportional to a dirac delta function [ @xmath10 with drude weight @xmath11 ( we set @xmath12 ) .",
    "electron - electron correlations modify this picture at zero temperature : the charge and spin fluctuations induce a dynamic disorder to the lattice potential which reduces the free - carrier drude weight by the inverse of the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and transfers the remaining spectral weight to a frequency - dependent component of @xmath9 reflecting the incoherent charge and spin fluctuations ; the total spectral weight is , however , conserved .",
    "finite - temperature effects will broaden the zero - frequency delta function into a lorentzian and can modify both the quasiparticle renormalization and the higher - frequency excitations .",
    "this simple picture is further modified when restriction is made to a single ( or finite number ) of electronic bands . in this case",
    ", the total spectral weight can vary as a function of temperature or interaction strength because the projection onto a restricted basis set disregards all excitations to electronic bands that are higher in energy than those that have been kept in the model .",
    "if the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath15 is large enough , then the system will be a mott insulator at half - filling .",
    "the single - particle density of states @xmath16 consists of two symmetric bands , separated by @xmath15 ( called the lower and upper hubbard bands ) with the fermi level lying in the middle of the gap .",
    "the renormalization factor @xmath13 diverges since there are no quasiparticles at the fermi level .",
    "the optical conductivity will consist of a charge - excitation peak centered at @xmath17 , whose width is the order of the bandwidth .",
    "as the system is doped away from half filling , a quasiparticle resonance appears at the fermi energy as @xmath0 .",
    "the weight of the quasiparticle peak increases with doping . in this case",
    ", the optical conductivity will have a drude peak ( from the `` free '' quasiparticles at the fermi energy ) and a mid - ir band ( because of excitations between the lower hubbard band and the quasiparticle peak ) in addition to the charge - excitation peak .",
    "the drude weight can be estimated as follows : when @xmath5 holes are doped into the half - filled band , the total electron concentration is @xmath18 , and the quasiparticle renormalization factor behaves roughly as @xmath19 , so the drude weight is expected to be @xmath20 which increases linearly for small and large doping , and is peaked near quarter filling @xmath21 . in addition , the weight of the mid - ir peak should also behave qualitatively like eq .",
    "( [ eq : drude_approx ] ) because it involves excitations between the quasiparticle peak and the lower hubbard band , which also should grow as the density of holes in the half - filled band .",
    "the `` hole - like '' nature of the charge excitations near half filling results from the strong coulomb renormalizations that create the mott insulator at exactly half filling .    in this contribution",
    ", we investigate the optical conductivity of the hubbard model in infinite dimensions .",
    "our methodology is detailed in section ii , where we discuss the formalism and calculational techniques .",
    "section iii contains our results , which include a drude peak whose width @xmath22 grows linearly with temperature , a mid - ir peak that becomes more visible at low temperatures and dopings , and a charge - excitation peak that decreases with doping and is weakly dependent upon @xmath4 .",
    "comparison of our results with experiment is presented in section iv , and conclusions are given in section v.",
    "motivated by the observations of anderson@xcite and zhang and rice@xcite we will study the single - band hubbard model@xcite in d - dimensions , with @xmath23 as a model for the cuo system .",

    "this model may be solved in the limit of high dimensions , using the observations of metzner and vollhardt @xcite that with increasing coordination number of the underlying lattice the many - body renormalizations due to a two - particle interaction like the hubbard-@xmath15 in ( [ eq : hubmod ] ) become purely local .",
    "the solution of the model ( [ eq : hubmod ] ) may be mapped onto the solution of purely local correlated system coupled to an effective ( self - consistently determined ) bath @xcite .",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) scheme based on the work of hirsch and fye @xcite has proven to be the most effective method for solving this strongly correlated local problem .",
    "dynamical properties of the model are then obtained using numerical analytic continuation ( employing maximum - entropy techniques)@xcite .",
    "this method requires a default model . to obtain the single - particle density of states we use the finite - u non - crossing approximation ( nca)@xcite result for the infinite - dimensional hubbard model as a default model at high temperatures , where it is essentially exact @xcite . at low temperatures , where the nca fails , we use the numerically continued result of the next higher temperature as a default model .",
    "the posterior probability of the final result is employed to determine which default model should be used . generally , we find that the crossover temperature between using the nca default model and the higher - temperature continuation lies at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the kondo - like scale for this model@xcite",

    "our conclusion is that the method of ref .",
    "is superior to any _ ad hoc _ fitting procedure in determining the low - temperature drude weight .",
    "note , however , that the charge - transfer peak is uniquely determined by the above fitting procedure ( in the sense that the results are independent of what fitting procedure is employed ) , indicating that the harmonic - oscillator form is a reasonable approximation to that peak .",
    "the existence of the drude and charge - excitation peaks have been reported previously @xcite .",

    "in addition , we can examine how the sum rule for the total spectral weight , and for it s component pieces ( drude , mid - ir , and charge - transfer ) evolve as a function of doping at fixed low temperature ( in fact , the following analysis is an approximation to the zero - temperature behavior of the different components of the spectral weight ) .",

    "note how the mid - ir peak initially increases linearly with doping until @xmath96 where it saturates and then decreases as the system becomes less correlated , and how the system changes from a hole - like metal to an electron - like metal at about quarter filling .",
    "in addition , one can easily see that the drude and mid - ir weights both grow quite rapidly as the system is doped away from half filling ( the initial growth rate of the mid - ir weight is about a factor of 2 faster than that of the drude weight ) .",
    "this fast growth of the drude and mid - ir weights explains why the optical conductivity for @xmath97 increases so rapidly with doping as shown in fig .",
    "[ optical_fill ] .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those found in the strong - coupling limit of the hubbard model in one dimension@xcite , indicating that the optical properties of the hubbard model are not strongly dependent upon the dimensionality ( with the exception that there is no mid - ir peak in one dimension )",
    ".    one can also inquire into the temperature dependence of the drude , mid - ir , and charge - transfer peaks at fixed doping .",
    "the analysis , in this case , relies on trying to fit the optical conductivity to the form in eq .",
    "[ eq : opt_cond_fit ] , as a function of temperature .",
    "such a procedure is ill - defined , because the drude and mid - ir peaks merge at high temperatures , and it is difficult to separate them into their component pieces , without explicit knowledge of the proper fitting forms .",
    "however , the qualitative physics can be discussed : we find that as the temperature is raised , that spectral weight is lost from the system ( i. e. , the magnitude of the expectation value of the kinetic - energy operator decreases as @xmath4 increases ) , that the drude and charge - transfer weights slightly increase , and that the mid - ir weight is sharply reduced . in addition ,",
    "spectral weight rapidly shifts to higher frequency , since the drude width ( which is easy to determine by the fitting procedure ) increases linearly with @xmath4 for temperatures larger than @xmath31 .",
    "the origin of all of these features in the optical conductivity can be understood by studying the single - particle density of states , plotted as a function of both temperature ( a ) and doping ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ optical_dos ] .",
    "clearly the drude peak results from the quasiparticle band which develops at low temperatures . we have shown previously that while this peak is developing ( _ i .",
    "e. _ in the region @xmath98 ) , the scattering rate ( as measured by the resistivity ) increases in proportion to the temperature@xcite .",
    "thus , the drude width also increases in proportion to the temperature .",
    "we attribute the mid - ir peak to excitations from the lower hubbard band to the quasiparticle band at the fermi energy .",
    "note that the quasiparticle resonance is only sharp and distinct from the lower hubbard band at low @xmath4 and small @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the mid - ir peak will only be visible in the optical conductivity at low @xmath4 and small @xmath5 as well .",
    "on the other hand , the upper peak at @xmath99 is due to the charge excitations from both the lower hubbard band and the quasiparticle band to the upper hubbard band . since the upper hubbard band is distinct from the quasiparticle weight at the fermi surface , and",
    "since the weight in the upper hubbard band does not change as significantly with doping , the upper peak in @xmath68 has a weaker temperature and doping dependence , but is expected to disappear as the system becomes uncorrelated in the low - density limit .",
    "many experimental measurements have been made of the optical conductivity in doped cuprates .",
    "kramers - kronig analysis is used to determine @xmath68 from reflectivity measurements in@xcite la@xmath100sr@xmath101cuo@xmath102 ( lsco ) , in@xcite yba@xmath103cu@xmath104o@xmath105 ( ybco ) , in@xcite bi@xmath103sr@xmath103cacu@xmath103o@xmath101 ( bscco ) , and in@xcite nd@xmath103cuo@xmath106 ( nco ) ; reviews have also been published@xcite .",
    "photoinduced absorption is also employed to measure the optical conductivity in@xcite ybco and in both@xcite lsco and nco .",
    "it is interesting to compare the theoretical calculation of the optical conductivity with these experimental results .",
    "the experiments yield six trends for the cuprate superconductors : 1 ) the mid - ir peak maximum moves to lower frequency , and merges with the drude peak as the doping increases ; its spectral weight grows very rapidly with doping near half filling ; 2 ) at a fixed value of the doping , spectral weight rapidly moves to lower frequency as @xmath0 , but the total weight in the drude and mid - ir peaks remains approximately constant ; the width of the drude peak decreases linearly with @xmath4 ; 3 ) the insulating ( or undoped ) phase has a charge - transfer gap ; when doped , the optical conductivity initially increases within the gap region , but eventually saturates and then decreases with doping ; 4 ) there is an isobestic point or nearly isobestic behavior ( in that the optical conductivity is nearly independent of doping ) at a frequency that is approximately one half of the charge - transfer gap ; 5 ) the effective charge has a constant value with respect to doping near the charge - transfer edge ; and 6 ) more than one peak is observed within the mid - ir region .",
    "most of these trends are reproduced by our theoretical model .",
    "in particular , fig .  [ optical_fill ] illustrates how the mid - ir peak moves to lower frequency and joins the drude peak ( 1 ) , how the optical conductivity initially increases with doping at low frequency , but then saturates and decreases ( 3 ) , and how there is an isobestic point ( 4 ) .",
    "[ optical_mir ] shows how the spectral weight is transferred to lower frequencies as the temperature is lowered , but we find that the total ( drude plus mid - ir ) spectral weight does not remain constant as in ( 2 ) because the temperature dependence of the expectation value @xmath107 produces some temperature dependence to the total drude plus mid - ir spectral weight ( it actually decreases as @xmath4 increases ) .",
    "[ optical_int ] does not display the trend of point ( 5 ) , possibly because the restriction to a single - band model reduces the optical conductivity at higher frequencies to such an extent that the effective charge must depend on the doping level for the theoretical model .",
    "we do not see the multiple peaks in the mid - ir region of point ( 6 ) .",
    "these experimental features are usually attributed@xcite to phonons or impurities present in the system , but judging from our results , the low - energy feature may also be due to excitations from the lower hubbard band to a dynamically generated quasi - particle band at the fermi energy ( which is generated by kondo - like screening of the moments ) .",
    "naturally , the single - band model fits the experminental data much better at lower frequencies , where the single - band approximation is relevant , but fails in reproducing some of the higher - energy trends found in the cuprates , because of the neglected bands .",
    "a comprehensive theory should include both the effects of strong electron correlation ( which reproduce the insulator at half filling , and give a hole - like character to the charge excitations near half filling ) with the effect of electron - phonon coupling ( which are necessary to explain similar mid - ir features in nonsuperconducting perovskites ) .",
    "a quantum monte carlo and maximum entropy calculation of the optical conductivity of the infinite - dimensional hubbard model has been presented .",
    "the mott - insulating character of the ground state at half filling drives many anomalous behaviors in the normal state near half filling that are similar to those observed in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "in particular the system is always a fermi liquid away from half filling , but the fermi temperature vanishes , and the quasiparticle renormalization factor diverges as half filling is approached . as a result ,",
    "the free carriers in the system initially have a hole - like character ( that changes to an electron - like character at approximately quarter filling ) .",
    "the drude width for these carriers grows linearly with temperature for temperatures above @xmath31 , the drude weight grows linearly with doping , and there is a doping and temperature dependent mid - ir peak .",
    "these anomalies arise naturally from the presence of a strongly temperature - dependent quasiparticle peak , whose origin is a kondo - like screening of the magnetic moments , and which appears to occur in the hubbard model for all dimensions greater than 1 .",
    "the anomalous features in the experimentally measured optical conductivity for the cuprates are usually attributed to either polarons or impurities .",
    "however , any purely polaronic theory has difficulty in explaining the magnetic insulating character of the ground state at half filling .",
    "the hubbard model naturally describes such an insulating state , and appears to also describe many of the anomalous features present in the experimental data . in light of this fact ,",

    "<S> a monte carlo - maximum entropy calculation of the optical conductivity of the infinite - dimensional hubbard model is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the optical conductivity displays the anomalies found in the cuprate superconductors , including a drude width which grows linearly with temperature , a drude weight which grows linearly with doping , and a temperature and doping - dependent mid - ir peak . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalies arise as a consequence of the dynamical generation of a quasiparticle band at the fermi energy as @xmath0 , and are a generic property of the strongly correlated hubbard model in all dimensions greater than one . </S>"
