    "if we compare the feynman diagrams required for @xmath5 and @xmath4 , we can see that non - abelian interactions vanish completely in the first case .",
    "moreover , changing the coupling constant and removing the global color factor , nlo qcd corrections to @xmath5 are exactly the same that the corresponding qed nlo corrections .",
    "since qed is an abelian theory , we can use a covariant gauge to compute virtual corrections and the result remains unchanged .",
    "however the same explanation can not be directly applied to @xmath6 because of na diagrams , although the central idea is related with gauge invariance .",
    "note that splitting functions are computed using a fixed physical - gauge ( lcg in particular ) in order to simplify factorization properties in the collinear limit .",
