    "quasars are amongst the most luminous sources in the universe . at cosmological distances ,",
    "their relatively small size ensures the regions responsible for producing the various spectral line components remains effectively unresolved with modern telescopes .",
    "gravitational microlensing , however , can significantly magnify the inner regions , providing clues to the various scales of structure located at the heart of quasars , giving some of the best estimates of the scale of the central continuum emitting region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as offering the possibility of probing the nature of other quasar small scale structure  @xcite .",
    "the degree of microlensing magnification is dependent upon the scale size of the source , with smaller sources being more susceptible to large magnifications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the continuum emitting region of a quasar is small enough to undergo significant magnification , the more extensive line emitting regions , specifically the blr with a scale length of 0.1-a few pc , were considered to be too large to suffer substantial magnification .",
    "@xcite undertook a study to determine the degree of microlensing of various models of the blr , examining the influence of a single microlensing mass in front of the emission region .",
    "when considering microlensing in multiply imaged quasars , however , many stars are expected to influence the light beam of a distant source , and these combine in a very non - linear fashion and the single star approximation is a poor one ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considered the microlensing of a blr at substantial optical depth .",
    "these studies found that while gravitational microlensing did result in the modification of the blr emission line profiles , the overall magnification of the region was small , typically less than 30% .",
    "these microlensing studies employed estimates of the size of the quasar blr based upon simple ionization models [ see @xcite ] .",
    "reverberation mapping , however , provides a more direct measure of the geometry of the blr and early studies suggested these simple ionization models had over estimated the scale of the blr by roughly an order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , prompting a revision of blr physics @xcite .",
    "more recent reverberation measurements have refined the size of the blrs in active galaxies , finding it to be @xmath0pc in low luminosity agn , up to @xmath1pc in luminous quasars , with the size of the blr scaling with the luminosity of the quasar , such that @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these results demonstrate the blr possesses a stratified structure , with high ionization lines being an order of magnitude smaller than lower ionization lines . following this discovery",
    ", @xcite reexamined the question of the microlensing of the blr region in light of this revised scale .",
    "undertaking an analysis similar to @xcite , they considered the influence of a single microlensing mass located in the blr , finding that significant modification of the blr line profile results .",
    "as with the approach of @xcite , the study of @xcite is a poor representation of microlensing at significant optical depth , the situation for multiply imaged quasars .",
    "this paper , therefore , also examines the question of microlensing of the blr , extending the previous work of @xcite into the higher optical depth regime .",
    "the approach to this question is described in section  [ method ] , whereas the results are discussed in section[results ] .",
    "the conclusions to this study are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the known number of multiply imaged quasars has been steadily growing in recent years @xcite . for the majority of these",
    ", little temporal data has been obtained and so this study focuses upon the quadruple quasar q2237 + 0305 , the first system in which microlensing was confirmed @xcite .",
    "the microlensing parameters , the surface mass density @xmath3 and the shearing due to external mass @xmath4 , were taken from the modeling of @xcite ; for images c and d the values for @xmath5 were @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "images a and b have similar microlensing parameters , chosen to be @xmath8 for the purpose of this study .",
    "these microlensing parameters may seem quite specific and hence not applicable to the population of lensed quasars in general .",
    "however , for multiply imaged systems the microlensing parameters must be substantial and hence the simulations in this paper can be taken as representative .",
    "furthermore , the important length scale in microlensing problems is the einstein radius ( er ) of a single star projected onto the source plane , with sources substantially smaller than this size susceptible significant magnification , whereas larger sources are more mildly affected by lensing @xcite . for q2237 + 0305 ,",
    "this length scale ( for a solar mass star ) is @xmath9=0.3 , @xmath10=0.7 and @xmath11km / s / mpc , is assumed . ] and is comparable to the revised scale of the blr in quasars . as q2237 + 0305 remains one of the few multiply imaged quasars in which microlensing has been unambiguously detected , it potentially offers the best chance of observing the influence of microlensing of the blr .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed discussion on the observability of blr microlensing for various gravitational lens systems .",
    "figure  [ fig1a ] presents the er for a solar mass star for a range of source redshifts , with lenses at @xmath12 & @xmath13 .",
    "the two panels on the right hand side present the expected size for the high ionization blr ( column topped with hi ) and low ionization blr ( lo ) , for a range of absolute v - band magnitudes ; these were calculated using the measured blr sizes of ngc 5548 and the @xmath14 scaling @xcite .",
    "clearly , the low ionization blr become quite extensive in moderately bright quasars ( @xmath15 ) , up to 10@xmath16 larger than the er for the majority of cases . for some configurations , with relatively nearby lenses , the difference is only a factor of four , a blr source size that is investigated in this paper .",
    "the size of the high ionization blr , however , is similar to the er for many lensing geometries , and is amenable to microlensing for quite luminous quasars .",
    "it should be noted that the er scales with the square root of the microlensing mass ; even accounting for a typical microlensing mass of @xmath17 , the high ionization blr for relatively bright quasars should be susceptible to microlensing . as an example , q2237 + 0305 , the quasar considered in this paper , has an absolute magnitude of @xmath18 [ accounting for a magnification of @xmath19 @xcite ] , with its er being comparable the scale of its high ionization blr , although the low ionization blr may be too extensive to be significantly magnified .",
    "magnification maps were constructed using a ray - tracing algorithm . for each image ,",
    "a square region 20 er on a side was generated .",
    "the resolution was chosen such that one er corresponded to 128 pixels and the number of rays traced ensured that the poissonian error in the mean magnification was less than 0.5% .      to address the question of how microlensing influences the blr it is important to determine how the region appears at particular velocities . to undertake this",
    ", the blr models of @xcite were adopted ; the mathematics of these models are presented in this earlier paper and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the blrs were constructed via a monte carlo approach , randomly distributing large numbers of clouds with the appropriate spatial , emissivity and velocity characteristics . by selecting in velocity",
    ", images of the source in 100 velocity slices were constructed .",
    "as per the earlier study of @xcite , two sizes for the blr were considered , a smaller source with a radius of 1 er , as well as a larger source of radius 4 er .",
    "a summary of the eight models employed in this study is presented in table  [ table1 ] ; this labeling will be used through the rest of this study .",
    ".summary of blr models : for each model , p denotes the radial form of the velocity field , such that @xmath20 , while @xmath21 represents the orientation of non - spherically symmetric models [ see @xcite].[table1 ] [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "recent studies have reappraised the scales of structure in quasars , with the indication that the blr , responsible for the broad emission lines seen in quasar spectra , is smaller than previously thought .",
    "this reduction in size makes the region more sensitive to the influence of gravitational microlensing .",
    "this paper has examined this influence on eight models of the blr , considering the microlensing parameters of the multiply imaged quasar q2237 + 0305 , extending previous studies into the high optical depth regime .    for the purpose of this study , two source sizes were adopted ; a small source with a radius of 1 er and a larger source with a radius of 4 er .",
    "it was found that the smaller source can undergo significant magnification , with the total line flux being enhanced by a factor of 2 on occasions . at the other extreme",
    ", this smaller source can be substantially demagnified ( with respect to the mean magnification ) such that its total flux is reduced to 20% of the mean magnified value .",
    "as expected , the variations are less dramatic for the larger sources , with a typical demagnification to @xmath22 , with magnification extremes of @xmath23 . in earlier studies which considered larger blr models ,",
    "the total line flux was found to remain relatively unchanged during microlensing .",
    "if , however , the revised blr sizes are correct , this paper has demonstrated that substantial fluctuations in the total line flux should result .",
    "this has an important consequence for studies of gravitational lensing as it implies that the relative broad line flux between images is not a measure of the relative image macromagnifications , a quantity important to gravitational lensing modelling .",
    "furthermore , this paper investigated the degree of modification of the form of the blr emission line via a measurement of its centroid .",
    "the majority of models considered possess symmetric surface brightness structure in velocity space , and the overall velocity centroid of the emission line remains unchanged during microlensing .",
    "however , considering only one half of the emission line it was found that substantial modification of the emission line profile can result .",
    "additionally , considering disk models that present asymmetric surface brightness structure as a function of velocity , it is seen that substantial centroid shifts of the entire emission line of @xmath24 can result .",
    "important differences were found in the microlensed behaviour for the models under consideration in this paper , with the degree of magnification and shift in the line centroid being dependent upon the surface brightness distribution as a function of velocity .",
    "an obvious example of this would be the detection of asymmetric modification of the overall emission line profile , indicating a surface brightness distribution which is asymmetric in velocity , such as a structure possessing rotation .",
    "while it goes beyond this current paper , these results reveal the possibility of undertaking detailed microlensing tomography of the blr via spectroscopic monitoring of multiply imaged quasars . however , current microlensing monitoring programs focus upon obtaining broadband photometry , effectively determining the the microlensing light curves for the continuum source .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies have revealed interesting blr profile line differences between various images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although no systematic spectroscopic program has been undertaken with most studies consisting of single or double epoch observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to fully determine the observational implications of this study , an investigation of the temporal relationship between the microlensing of the blr and the continuum emitting source is required , allowing the development of an optimum override strategy such that spectroscopic observations can be obtained",
    "this is the subject of a forthcoming article .",
    "joachim wambsganss is thanked for providing a copy of his microlensing raytracing code which was employed in this study and scott croom is thanked for helping unraveling what bright means when talking about quasars .",
    "the authors are extremely grateful to the centre for astrophysics and supercomputing at swinburne university of technology for providing substantial computational resources available to this project , and apologize to b. conn , j. chapman and i. klamer for the mondas s screeching alarm when its cpus overheated ."
