    "present astrophysical and cosmological observations indicate that there is a tiny energy density ( the cosmological constant ) @xmath0 spread all over the universe , which is responsible for its accelerated expansion .",
    "this energy density is incredibly small as compared with the contribution of qcd condensates to the total vacuum energy density , which is expected to be of order @xmath1 .",
    "an even much larger contribution @xmath2 must come from the electroweak symmetry breaking , while the contribution of zero  modes should push the total vacuum energy density up to @xmath3 .",
    "because of the enormous cancellation between the contributions of different condensates to @xmath4 , the smallness of the cosmological constant should be regarded as a fine  tuning problem .",
    "the smallness of the cosmological constant could be related to an almost exact symmetry .",
    "an exact global supersymmetry ( susy ) ensures zero value for the energy density at the minimum of the potential of the scalar fields .",
    "however the breakdown of supersymmetry induces a huge and positive contribution to the total vacuum energy density of order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the susy breaking scale .",
    "the non  observation of superpartners of quarks and leptons implies that @xmath7 .",
    "in @xmath8 supergravity ( sugra ) models the scalar potential is specified in terms of the k@xmath9hler function @xmath10 which is a combination of two functions : the k@xmath9hler potential @xmath11 and the superpotential @xmath12 .",
    "here we use standard supergravity mass units : @xmath13 .",

    "it is assumed that the superfields of the hidden sector @xmath17 interact with the observable ones only by means of gravity . at the minimum of the scalar potential ,",
    "hidden sector fields acquire vacuum expectation values breaking local susy and generating a non  zero gravitino mass @xmath18",
    ".    in general the vacuum energy density at the minimum of the sugra scalar potential ( [ 2 ] ) is huge and negative @xmath19 , so that an enormous fine  tuning is required to keep @xmath20 around the observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if supergravity is supplemented by a global symmetry that ensures a zero value for the cosmological constant .",
    "this is precisely what happens in no - scale supergravity .",
    "the lagrangian of a no  scale sugra model is invariant under the imaginary translations and dilatations which are subgroups of the @xmath21 group .",
    "the simplest no  scale sugra model involves only one hidden sector superfield @xmath22 and a set of chiral supermultiplets @xmath23 in the observable sector , which transform differently under the imaginary translations ( @xmath24 ) and dilatations ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "these symmetries constrain the k@xmath9hler function so that @xmath26\\ , , \\qquad w=\\sum_{\\sigma,\\lambda,\\gamma}\\frac{1}{6 } y_{\\sigma\\lambda\\gamma}\\ , \\varphi_{\\sigma}\\varphi_{\\lambda}\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\ , .",
    "\\label{3}\\ ] ] the structure of the k@xmath9hler function ( [ 3 ] ) ensures the vanishing of the vacuum energy density in the considered model .",
    "thus imaginary translations and dilatations protect a zero value for the cosmological constant in supergravity .",
    "however these symmetries also preserve supersymmetry in all vacua , which has to be broken in any phenomenologically acceptable theory .",
    "it was argued that the breakdown of dilatation invariance does not necessarily result in a non ",
    "zero vacuum energy density @xcite@xcite .",
    "let us consider a sugra model with two hidden sector fields @xmath22 and @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 and the observable superfields @xmath23 transform under imaginary translations and dilatations as before , whereas the superfield @xmath27 transforms similarly to @xmath23 .",
    "then the hidden sector superfield @xmath27 can appear in the full superpotential of the model : @xmath28 here we include a bilinear mass term for the superfield @xmath27 and higher order terms @xmath29 that spoil dilatation invariance . at the same time",
    "we do not allow the breakdown of dilatation invariance in the superpotential of the observable sector , in order to avoid the appearance of potentially dangerous terms which lead , for instance , to the so  called @xmath30problem in the simplest susy models .",
    "we also assume that the dilatation invariance is broken in the k@xmath9hler potential of the observable sector , so that the full k@xmath9hler potential takes the form : @xmath31+\\sum_{\\sigma , \\lambda}\\biggl(\\frac{\\eta_{\\sigma\\lambda}}{2}\\,\\varphi_{\\sigma}\\ , \\varphi_{\\lambda}+h.c.\\biggr)+ \\sum_{\\sigma}\\xi_{\\sigma}|\\varphi_{\\sigma}|^2\\ , .",
    "\\label{5}\\ ] ] here we restrict our consideration to the simplest set of terms that break dilatation invariance in the k@xmath9hler potential .",
    "additional terms which are proportional to @xmath32 normally appear in minimal sugra models .",
    "the other terms @xmath33 give rise to effective @xmath30 terms after the spontaneous breakdown of local supersymmetry , solving the @xmath30 problem .",
    "we only allow the breakdown of the dilatation invariance in the k@xmath9hler potential of the observable sector , since any variations in the k@xmath9hler potential of the hidden sector may spoil the vanishing of the vacuum energy density in global minima .    in the considered sugra model the scalar potential of the hidden sector",
    "is positive definite @xmath34 so that the vacuum energy density vanishes near its global minima .",
    "the minima of the scalar potential ( [ 6 ] ) are attained at the stationary points of the hidden sector superpotential . in the simplest case when all the coefficients @xmath35 , @xmath36 has two extremum points at @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the first vacuum , where @xmath38 , local supersymmetry is broken so that the gravitino becomes massive @xmath39 and all scalar particles get non  zero masses @xmath40 . in the second minimum , with @xmath37 ,",
    "the superpotential of the hidden sector vanishes and local susy remains intact , so that the low  energy limit of this theory is described by a pure susy model in flat minkowski space . if the high order terms @xmath29 are present in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , the scalar potential of the hidden sector may have many degenerate vacua with broken and unbroken supersymmetry in which the vacuum energy density vanishes",
    ".    thus the considered breakdown of dilatation invariance leads to a natural realisation of the multiple point principle ( mpp ) .",
    "the mpp postulates the existence of many phases with the same energy density which are allowed by a given theory @xcite .",
    "when applied to @xmath8 supergravity , mpp implies the existence of a vacuum in which the low  energy limit of the considered theory is described by a pure supersymmetric model in flat minkowski space . according to the mpp this vacuum and",
    "the physical one in which we live must be degenerate .",
    "such a second vacuum is only realised if the sugra scalar potential has a minimum where the following conditions are satisfied @xmath41 this would normally require an extra fine - tuning .",
    "however , in the sugra models considered above , the mpp conditions are fulfilled automatically without any extra fine - tuning at the tree  level .",
    "since the vacuum energy density of supersymmetric states in flat minkowski space is just zero and all vacua in the mpp inspired sugra models are degenerate , the cosmological constant problem is thereby solved to first approximation by assumption .",
    "however the value of the cosmological constant may differ from zero in the considered models .",
    "this occurs if non  perturbative effects in the observable sector give rise to the breakdown of supersymmetry in the second vacuum ( phase ) .",
    "our mpp philosophy then requires that the physical phase in which local supersymmetry is broken in the hidden sector has the same energy density as a phase where supersymmetry breakdown takes place in the observable sector .",
    "if supersymmetry breaking takes place in the second vacuum , it is caused by the strong interactions . when the gauge couplings at high energies are identical in both vacua , their running down to the scale @xmath42 are also the same . below the scale @xmath43",
    "all superparticles in the physical vacuum decouple and the corresponding beta functions change . using the value of @xmath44 and the matching condition @xmath45 ,",
    "one finds the scale @xmath46 , where the supersymmetric qcd interactions become strong in the second vacuum : @xmath47\\,,\\qquad \\frac{1}{\\alpha^{(2)}_3(m_s)}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{(1)}_3(m_z)}- \\frac{\\tilde{b}_3}{4\\pi}\\ln\\frac{m^2_{s}}{m_z^2}\\ , .",

    "quark yukawa coupling in the mssm is of the same order of magnitude as the strong gauge coupling .",
    "the large yukawa coupling of the top quark may result in the formation of a quark condensate that breaks supersymmetry inducing a non  zero positive value for the cosmological constant @xmath52 .      in fig .",
    "1 the dependence of @xmath46 on the susy breaking scale @xmath43 is examined . because @xmath53 the qcd gauge coupling below @xmath43 is larger in the physical minimum than in the second one .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath46 is much lower than the qcd scale in the standard model and diminishes with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "when the supersymmetry breaking scale in our vacuum is of the order of 1 tev , we obtain @xmath54 ev .",
    "this results in an enormous suppression of the total vacuum energy density ( @xmath55 ) compared to say an electroweak scale contribution in our vacuum @xmath56 . from the rough estimate @xmath52 of the energy density",
    ", it can be easily seen that the measured value of the cosmological constant is reproduced when @xmath57 ev @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the appropriate values of @xmath46 can therefore only be obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "however the consequent large splitting within susy multiplets would spoil gauge coupling unification in the mssm and reintroduce the hierarchy problem , which would make the stabilisation of the electroweak scale rather problematic .",
    "a model consistent with electroweak symmetry breaking and cosmological observations can be constructed , if the mssm particle content is supplemented by an additional pair of @xmath59 multiplets .",
    "these new bosons and fermions would not affect gauge coupling unification , because they form complete representations of @xmath60 .",
    "in the physical vacuum these extra particles would gain masses around the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the corresponding mass terms in the superpotential are generated after the spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry , due to the presence of the bilinear terms @xmath61 $ ] in the k@xmath9hler potential of the observable sector .",
    "near the second minimum of the sugra scalar potential the new particles would be massless , since @xmath62 . therefore they give a considerable contribution to the @xmath63 functions ( @xmath64 ) , reducing @xmath46 further . in this case the observed value of the cosmological constant can be reproduced even for @xmath65 ( see fig .",
