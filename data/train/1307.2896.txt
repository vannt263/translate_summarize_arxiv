    "the processes in the interstellar medium ( ism , or gas ) that determine its distribution , structure , and the formation of stars are multiple , very complex , and operate on atomic to galactic size scales ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this makes it difficult to develop a comprehensive model for the distribution of gas and star formation in galaxies from first principles .",
    "fortunately , normal galaxies are usually in a marginally stable equilibrium state . here",
    "we use this fact as the basis of a model for the distribution of gas in galaxies , and with some additional assumptions we extend this into a model of the star formation distribution .",
    "our aim is to construct an easy to implement model for the distribution of gas and star formation in galaxies that can be used to compare to observations and to easily create realistic simulated galaxies .",
    "our approach also allows difficult to observe properties of galaxies ( e.g.  the molecular ism distribution ) to be inferred from those that are relatively easy to determine or infer ( the stellar mass profile and rotation curve ) .",
    "star formation has long been believed to be related to disk ( in)stability .",
    "major studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been carried out on gravitational disk stability since the 1960s and the theory of this subject is well developed .",
    "however , as early as 1972 , @xcite claimed that the whole galactic disk should be marginally stable due to negative feedback mechanism .",
    "he used this assumption to predict the gas surface density profile ; his model roughly matches the observations in the outer regions of his sample galaxies but overestimates the densities in the inner half of the galaxies .",
    "since then , observational evidence for quirk s statement that disk galaxies are usually in a marginally stable state has mounted and been noticed in various studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gravitational stability parameter @xmath3 ( see section [ threshold ] for details ) for a single component thin disk was first derived by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a sample of tens of galaxies to show that there is very little star formation where @xmath3 is above some critical threshold .",
    "@xcite confirmed the result using more recent data .",
    "however a single fluid @xmath3 does not accurately indicate the stability of a real disk which contains both stars and gas .",
    "@xcite derived the two - fluid ( stars and gas ) stability parameter @xmath0 for a thin disk .",
    "@xcite improved the derivation by considering the stellar component as collisionless , yielding a rigorous but elaborate form of the stability parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite proposed an approximation for the two - fluid stability parameter , @xmath1 , which is widely used because of its simple form .",
    "more recently , @xcite reexamined the @xcite approximation and gave a simple but more accurate effective two - fluid stability parameters for both an infinitesimally thin ( @xmath5 ) and finite thickness ( @xmath6 ) galactic disks .",
    "inspired by the @xcite and recent studies on disk stability theory and star formation laws , we develop and test the ` constant @xmath3 disk ' ( cq - disk ) model , which we define as : a two - fluid ( gas+stars ) axisymmetric thin disk will evolve into a marginally stable state with a constant stability parameter @xmath0 through out the galactic disk .",
    "the basic idea for this model is to use the constancy of the two - fluid stability parameter to predict the distribution of gas and then use empirical molecular - to - neutral gas ratio ( @xmath2 ) relations and the best star formation law ( sfl ) to predict the distribution of neutral and molecular gas as well as star formation rate .",
    "here we compare the observed distribution of the ism , and star formation in a small sample of galaxies to our model in order to test our assumptions and to optimise the model by trialling different recipes for its key ingredients ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and the sfl ) .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : section [ bkintro ] briefly introduces background information , e.g. the gravitational stability parameter , molecular - to - neutral gas ratio model , and star formation laws ; section [ model ] presents the detailed model we construct ; section [ data ] gives a brief description of our sample galaxies ; section [ results ] shows the results ; in section [ discussion ] we discuss the assumption and implications of our model ; and in section [ application ] we discuss further tests and possible uses of our model .",
    "through out this paper , we are only concerned with the large scale star formation in the galactic disk , hence we suppose the disk is axisymmetric and focus on the radial profiles of various physical quantities . as our research progressed it became useful to divide the galactic disk in to three regions : central ( within @xmath7 ) , intermediate ( @xmath8 ) and outer ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is the optical radius , defined by where the @xmath11 band surface brightness reaches 25 mag arcsec@xmath12 . in general , our model works best in the intermediate radii , and much of the testing of the model is limited to these radii .",
    "the profiles we create often do not match the observations in detail in the central region , although , as we will show , the match to quantities integrated over the central region is reasonable .",
    "we can not test our star formation models in the outer disk because the star formation intensity was not measured beyond @xmath10 in our data sources .",
    "in @xcite we discuss the expected ism structure in the outer disk .",
    "there we showed that a gas dominated constant @xmath3 outer disk should have a surface mass density fall - off with the same profile as the dark matter for systems with a flat rotation curve , thus explaining the close relationship between dark matter and hi @xcite .",
    "the other reason that we make these divisions is that the rcs are generally more reliable in the intermediate disk : there are less or even no data points in the central regions , while often warps and asymmetries are present in the outer regions .",
    "@xcite showed that galactic disks can be unstable to axis - symmetric perturbations , and that the stability of a thin disk to such a perturbation can be represented quantitatively in a single parameter @xmath3 .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we express the stability parameter for a gaseous disk : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gas velocity dispersion . typically @xmath14 is assumed to be constant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l08 ) , although observations show that it typically slowly varies with radius .",
    "@xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16 is the gas surface mass density and @xmath17 is the epicyclic frequency which can be calculated from the rotation curve using @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the circular velocity of the gas at a distance @xmath20 from the galactic centre .",
    "@xmath3 parameter can be an indicator for widespread star formation : a large stability parameter ( @xmath21 ) means that pressure and centrifugal forces are sufficient to support the disk and thus it is stable , while a small @xmath22 means the gravity exceeds the internal support and the disk will collapse , resulting in widespread star formation @xcite .    for a single component stellar disk , we can use a similar parameter , @xmath23 , to indicate gravitational stability of the stars @xcite , but redefined as the equation shown above by later authors e.g.  @xcite in order to use a more consistent expression with regards to @xmath24 . ] : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the star surface mass density and @xmath27 is the radial component of the stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "we follow the estimation of @xmath27 given by l08 : assuming a typical fixed shape to the velocity dispersion ellipsoid , we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the z - direction component of the stellar velocity dispersion and using the standard relationship between this , disk scale height @xmath30 , and mass density for an isothermal disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have @xmath31 here @xmath30 is assumed to be a constant through out the galaxy disk ( e.g. as done by l08 ) .",
    "since , @xmath30 is difficult to measure unless the galaxy is viewed edge - on , we follow l08 and use the exponential stellar disk s scale length , @xmath32 , to estimate it . using the average flattening ratio @xmath33 , measured by @xcite , we then obtain @xmath34    galactic disks are composed of both gas and stars .",
    "thus , we need to consider both of them in a more sophisticated disk stability theory .",
    "there have been numerous studies on the two - fluid disk stability theory and therefore different forms of two - fluid stability parameters , @xmath35 .",
    "here we introduce four of them :    @xcite explored the gravitational stability of a two - fluid thin disk .",
    "later - on , @xcite extended this work by treating the stellar part of the disk as collisionless and gave an explicit expression for the total stability parameter @xmath4 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the wave number of the instability being considered .",
    "we take @xmath39 to be the wavenumber of the most unstable mode in our calculations ( l08 ) . in this paper",
    ", we make a coarse searching through the parameter space of @xmath39 and find the value which gives the lowest gas surface mass density .",
    "we find that the galaxies studied here have @xmath40 , consistent with the result of l08 .",
    "although the @xcite derivation of the two - fluid stability parameter is quite rigorous , it is complicated and wavenumber dependent , making it hard to use .",
    "@xcite give a much simpler form , @xmath1 : @xmath41 it is widely used by astronomers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although the analysis deriving it has been criticised @xcite .",
    "@xcite improved the @xcite approximation and proposed an effective @xmath3 parameter for a two - fluid infinitesimally thin disk , @xmath5 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is defined above in eq .",
    "[ eq_y ] .    in reality , disks are not infinitesimally thin , and the thickness of the disk has a stabilising effect .",
    "therefore , @xcite also give an expression for a disk of finite thickness , @xmath6 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a factor , by which the stability parameter of each component increases , reflecting the effect of the thickness of the disk .",
    "the factor @xmath46 depends on the ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersion : @xmath47 . so that we have @xmath48 for gas , and @xmath49 for stars .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath24 values for 15 disk galaxies are almost a constant .",
    "similarly @xcite used more recent measurements to show that @xmath24 is constant over a large fraction of the outer disks of galaxies where hi dominates the mass .",
    "@xcite tested the @xcite @xmath1 on more disk galaxies and got a similar result .",
    "l08 used the @xcite @xmath4 in testing the star formation threshold for 23 nearby galaxies and get a remarkably flat @xmath4 thorough the optically bright part of galactic disks with @xmath50 .",
    "one plausible explanation for this phenomena is self - regulation by star formation @xcite : an unstable disk ( low @xmath3 ) will collapse and commence widespread star formation . the star formation will consume most of the gas in a short time @xcite , also the resulting winds from high mass stars and supernovae explosions will expel part of the gas out of the galactic disk @xcite and heat up the remaining gas @xcite .",
    "this will increase @xmath3 by lowering @xmath16 and increasing @xmath14 and thus make the disk more stable . on the other hand , a stable disk ( high @xmath3 )",
    "will have suppressed star formation because the gas can not collapse .",
    "this means less heating of the ism through winds and supernovae , and hence a relative cooling and lowering of @xmath14 , thus decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "thus a negative feedback system is set up and it will finally come to a stable equilibrium state . here",
    "we suppose that galaxies equilibrate to the same @xmath3 at all radii through this local feedback cycle : regions of low @xmath3 heat up locally due to feedback , while regions of high @xmath3 cool due to relative lack of star formation .",
    "we test whether @xmath3 is constant within the optically bright portion of galaxies , and consider whether @xmath3 may be constant within a galaxy , but vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "this might happen if the balance in the local support between epicyclic frequency @xmath17 and velocity dispersion @xmath51 varies due to changes in the relative importance of angular momentum and feedback , perhaps due to initial mass function variations @xcite or metallicity dependent cooling .",
    "it is useful to have an accurate prescription for determining the molecular to neutral ratio ( @xmath52 ) because these phases of the ism are measured with separate observations and because it is generally believed that star formation is more related to the the molecular rather than the atomic gas . in practice",
    "the molecular data has been more expensive to obtain than  data and requires use of tracers of h@xmath53 like co emission .",
    "the advent of new facilities like sma , carma and alma may change these economics .",
    "various simple prescriptions for determining @xmath2 have been raised in previous studies ( cf .",
    "l08 and references therein ) .",
    "l08 used high quality hi and co data to assess four of the most popular @xmath2 prescriptions and found two that worked well .",
    "the first is purely empirical and involves just the stellar surface mass density ( we call this the sr relation or @xmath54 ) @xmath55 the other uses hydrostatic pressure @xmath56 as a parameter ( the pr relation or @xmath57 ) and is @xmath58 where @xmath56 is given by @xcite as @xmath59 where @xmath29 can be calculated using eq .",
    "[ sigma_sz ] .",
    "although l08 found that @xmath56 is not as good of a predictor of @xmath2 as the stellar surface mass density , it has a more solid physical basis @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter kr relation or @xmath60 ) and tested by @xcite using numerical simulations . in this model",
    "the molecular gas can only exist in a region well shielded from the uv radiation field .",
    "the approximate solution is @xmath61 @xcite , where @xmath62 and where @xmath63 is a dimensionless number representing the scaled radiation field , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dust cross section per hydrogen atom and @xmath66 is the mean mass per nucleus .",
    "following @xcite , we take the approximation that @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the metallicity normalised to the solar value . from eq .",
    "[ eq_molk ] - [ eq_zprime ] we expect some troublesome asymptotic behaviour in low density and low metallicity regions because a small @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) leads to a negative @xmath60 .",
    "we therefore set negative @xmath60 values to zero in our code , which means there is no molecular gas in low density and low metallicity regions .",
    "we test all three relations to estimate @xmath2 in our calculation ( using the total gas surface mass density derived using our model , cf model description in section [ model ] ) and see which prescription best models the @xmath72 and @xmath73 profiles .",
    "the sfl is usually defined as the relationship between star formation rate and ism properties , especially density .",
    "the sfl allows one to calculate the star formation rate given gas density and some other galactic parameters or vice versa .",
    "this is usually expressed as the surface density of star formation , @xmath74 , defined as the sfr per unit area , or in other words the star formation intensity .",
    "there have been numerous sfls and here we summarise and test the most popular ones in the literature ( l08 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "[ sfls ]      probably the most well known and widely used sfl is the schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite .",
    "it is a simple empirical correlation between star formation intensity and total gas : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a coefficient with unit of [ @xmath77 , @xmath16 is the surface mass density of the gas ( both neutral and molecular ) , and @xmath78 @xcite . here",
    "we fix @xmath79 in our tests of @xmath80 .",
    "the power law index @xmath81 of schimidt - kennicutt law is very close to 1.5 , which can be explained by arguing that stars form in a free - fall time scale in a gas disk with fixed scale height : since the free fall time scale @xmath82 is proportional to the inverse square root of the local gas density @xmath83 , then for a fixed scale height @xmath84 , the star formation intensity is @xcite : @xmath85 therefore the star formation intensity in a free - fall timescale with fixed scale height can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 has the same unit as @xmath76 .",
    "so this version of the sfl is nearly the same as the schmidt - kennicutt sfl with a slightly higher @xmath88 .      if the disk scale height is not fixed but set by hydrostatic equilibrium , then the star formation law ( still assuming stars form in disk free - fall time scale ) is @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 has the same unit as @xmath76 .",
    "if we instead assume that a constant fraction of the ism is consumed in a dynamical timescale , we would have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a dimensionless coefficient and @xmath93 is the orbital angular frequency @xcite . following the suggestion of this functional form by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite showed that this form of the sfl was able to account for the star formation intensity in his sample of normal galaxies and circum - nuclear star burst , and worked equally well as @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite presented a star formation model which assumes that star formation is triggered by gmc collisions in a shearing disk .",
    "this predicts that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a dimensionless coefficient , @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the circular velocity at a particular galactocentric radius @xmath20 . note @xmath98 for a flat rotation curve .",
    "the gmc collision sfl is only meant to be valid in regions where a significant fraction of the gas is in gravitationally bound clouds , which typically means @xmath99",
    ". however , here we test it over a wider range of densities .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied 12 nearby spiral galaxies at sub - kpc resolution and concluded that the sfr is proportional to the molecular content : @xmath100 where the coefficient @xmath101 has the same unit as @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite provided a turbulence - regulated star formation model to predict the sfr by assuming stars primarily form in molecular clouds that are virialised and supersonically turbulent and that the probability distribution of densities is lognormal .",
    "the intensity of star formation by their model is given by @xmath102 where the coefficient @xmath103 has the same unit as @xmath76 , @xmath104 is the mass fraction of gas in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and can be approximated as @xmath105 , and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a two - component star formation law , @xmath107 where the coefficient @xmath108 has the same unit as @xmath76 , and @xmath109 is a ` critical ' gas surface mass density . in regions with @xmath110 ,",
    "gmcs have an internal pressure that far exceeds the ambient gas pressure and the star formation time scale is independent of the environment ; whilst in regions with @xmath111 , the star formation time scale depends on the metallicity and the clumping .",
    "our model requires at least three inputs : the rotation curve , gas velocity dispersion and the stellar mass distribution .",
    "the metallicity is also needed if using the kr relation ( cf .",

    "this systematic variation may cause over prediction of gas and sfr surface densities in the central and outer regions .",
    "a rapid central rise of @xmath1 can have several explanations , which are discussed in section [ centraldisk ] .",
    "the slow rise of @xmath1 beyond @xmath10 might be caused by undetected molecular gas in the outer disk , or may be due to the limited supply of ism as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the gas velocity dispersion is hard to measure @xcite and has large uncertainties ( cf .",
    "[ fig_vsig ] ) . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ q_vsig ] the shape of the @xmath1 profiles is not greatly affected by choosing a constant @xmath14 or adopting the observed @xmath14 profiles . in four cases ( ngc3198 , ngc3521 , ngc2841 , and ngc7331 ) the profiles",
    "are noticeably shifted vertically between the two options .",
    "this is because the measured @xmath14 is significantly higher than the assumed value of 11 km s@xmath167 .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig_vsig ] that the @xmath14 needed to keep a constant @xmath1 ( using the observed @xmath26 and @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ qg ] , [ qs ] and [ qws ] ) is pretty constant and close to @xmath168 and well within @xmath169 uncertainty of the measured gas velocity dispersion .",
    "it might be surprising that @xmath1 does not vary much no matter whether we use a constant @xmath170 or the measured @xmath14 .",
    "this is because the definition of @xmath1 ( eq . [ qws ] ) is similar to the equivalent resistance of two resistors connected in parallel and @xmath23 is usually smaller than @xmath24 in the inner and intermediate disk regions .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is usually dominated by the @xmath23 value .",
    "this also illustrates that it is the total stability parameter , @xmath0 , instead of @xmath24 that matters most and the interaction between gas and stars plays an important role in balancing the stability of galactic disk .",
    "figures [ sfr_p ] - [ sfr_k ] , suggest that our model overestimates @xmath16 and/or @xmath74 in the central disk for many of the sample galaxies . in e.g. ngc 2841 , ngc 2403 and ngc 7331 , the model overestimates @xmath16 and @xmath74 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this result is similar to that of @xcite although he used a different stability criterion @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that this is because the density - wave - induced shocks , which are very strong in the inner parts of the galaxy , make the gas in the post shock regions dense enough to be jeans unstable .",
    "thus their stability criteria , which does not consider shocks , may not be a good representation for the inner disk stability .",
    "however , our model does work well in the central part of other galaxies , e.g. ngc 7793 , and furthermore , our model sometimes underestimates the central disk sfr of galaxies like ngc 6946 and ngc 925 .",
    "possible reasons for the model - observation discrepancy in the central disk could be the fitted functional form of the rotation curves are not good enough to represent the data ( cf .",
    "section [ rcs ] ) , or the central disk is not a suitable place to apply our model because it is dominated by a bulge instead of being pure disk .    despite these complications and the poor fit to the central region in detail , fig .",
    "[ sfr_ratio ] shows that the sfr integrated over the central region from our model agrees with the data to a similar level of accuracy as it does over the intermediate radii .",
    "the specific model we are using here employs the @xmath1 recipe for @xmath0 , the sr formulation of @xmath2 , and the linear molecular sfl @xmath171 . the relatively good agreement in the central region",
    "is because usually the model only fails badly in the very central part of the disk , typically covering an area less than 50%   of the central disk .",
    "therefore , the integrated sfr does not deviate from the observation very much .",
    "the exception to this is ngc 2841 , where the modelled sfr profiles shown in figs .",
    "[ sfr_s ] - [ sfr_k ] deviate strongly from the observed over the entire central disk .    .",
    "solid symbols are for intermediate disk and open symbols are for central disk .",
    "the specific model we are using here is the @xmath1 recipe for @xmath0 , the sr formulation of @xmath2 , and the linear molecular sfl @xmath171 . ]      since @xmath3 is dependent on the derivative of the rotation curve ( through @xmath17 ) , the precise shape of the smooth fit must have a quite strong effect on the result , especially in the inner region , where the rotation curve rises rapidly . in order to test this effect",
    ", we use the exponential parameterisation to fit the rc of ngc 2403 and use these new fitting results to recalculate the gas and star formation distribution .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ngc2403_exp ] .",
    "the exponential form results in a shallower slope in the rising part of the rc and therefore a lowered gas and star formation surface density in the central region compared to the result of the urc fitting ; whilst the urc form fitting results in a steeper slope and thus a higher gas and star formation surface density in the central region . as expected , different forms of rc fittings make little difference in the middle and outer disk for galaxies with a flat rc .    .",
    "red dots are calculated using the fitted urc form and green triangles are calculated using fitted exponential rotation curve .",
    "lower - left panel is hi surface mass density and lower - right panel is sfr surface density . in these panels",
    "the black dots with error bars are measured data with uncertainties .",
    "the red lines are calculated using the fitted urc rotation curve and green lines are calculated using the fitted exponential rotation curve , in both cases the appropriate constant @xmath1 is adopted .",
    "solid lines are results using the sr prescription for @xmath2 and dash lines use the pr prescription .",
    "the sfl used here is the linear molecular sfl . ]",
    "examination of figs . [ sigma_hi ]  [ sfr_k ] and tables [ rmol_tab ] - [ sfl_parameter2 ] demonstrate that the cq - disk model does a reasonable job ( factor of @xmath166 agreement ) of matching the overall shape of the , co , and sfr radial profiles especially at intermediate radii .",
    "figure [ q_vsig ] indicates that these radii are where @xmath0 is not only fairly flat but at its minimum , i.e.  the most unstable but uniformly so",
    ". this may be because at these radii star formation feedback is effective and the timescales for ism flows are sufficient for profiles to evolve to nearly constant stability .",
    "as emphasised in sec 6.2 , the model has the most difficulties fitting the detailed profiles in the central regions of galaxies , but still is fairly reasonable in predicting quantities integrated out to @xmath172 .    even at intermediate radii",
    ", the model curves do not match the profiles in close detail , with the observed profiles having small scale bumps , dips , and kinks .",
    "often these local enhancements can also be seen in the profiles of @xmath0 , hi , h@xmath53 , and sfr ( e.g.  the kinks in the profiles in ic  2574 and ngc  3521 at @xmath173 kpc ) .",
    "these indicate that local enhancements in the gas density are reflected in the sfr profiles as expected by any reasonable sfl , but result in the @xmath3 profiles not being flat in detail .",
    "while disks may be evolving towards a uniform stability , local deviations may build up due to processes beyond the scope of this model ( e.g.  internal resonances , external perturbations , minor mergers ) .",
    "hence the cq - disk model is not as well suited to modelling the details of individual galaxies as the overall structure of galaxies in general .",
    "our sample is relatively small .",
    "further high quality observations would be useful to further test and optimise our model .",
    "new and developing generations of instrumentation including the jvla , askap , meerkat , westerbork+apertif for  observations , alma , carma , and sma for co ( and thus h@xmath53 ) , wise , panstarrs , lsst for modelling stellar content , combined with star formation surveys such as hags @xcite , singg @xcite , and 11hugs @xcite as well as the wide availability of images of star formation from galex and wise data mean that it will be possible to do studies similar to ours for well selected samples of hundreds or thousands of galaxies in the near future .",
    "examination of figures [ sigma_hi ]  [ sfr_k ] demonstrates that the various @xmath2 and sfl prescriptions diverge from each other the most in the outer and central regions of galaxies . for the reasons discussed in sec .",
    "6.2 the centre is more difficult to model .",
    "so we concentrate on how further study of lsb galaxies and outer disks may improve our model .",
    "the sr and pr recipes diverge from each other there because the former only depends on the stellar surface mass density , while the hydrostatic pressure used in the pr prescription becomes more dominated by gas .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the kr relation combined with the metallicity gradients typically seen in the bright parts of galaxies @xcite will also drive a radial gradient compared to the sr and pr prescriptions .",
    "lsb regions are also important to test because of indications of low level star formation in extended uv disk galaxies @xcite and  dominated regions @xcite .",
    "this low intensity star formation likely signifies imf variations @xcite which should be incorporated in future versions of a more comprehensive cq - disk model .",
    "comparison of the integrated  mass and star formation rate may provide a sensitive test of our model since figures 4 , and 6 - 8 show that  and star formation are largely segregated in galaxies , and the divergent behaviour of the various model profiles suggests that the /sfr ratio is likely to be dependent on the @xmath2 and sfl prescriptions .",
    "we will test this using data from the singg and sungg star formation surveys ( zheng et al .",
    "2013 , in prep ) .",
    "the cq - disk model may prove useful in galaxy simulations .",
    "for example , currently when generating the initial distribution of particles for n body simulations of interacting galaxies one often creates disks with the same scale length for stars and gas ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or giving the stellar disks exponential profiles with differing scale lengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . assuming a constant @xmath0 disk provides alternative easy to implement initial conditions for detailed simulations of galaxies .",
    "one could also use the cq - disk model to enhance semi - analytic cosmological simulations , i.e.  in a manner similar to that done by @xcite who modeled the detectability of galaxies in future  surveys .",
    "a similar application of the cq - disk model will allow better  line profile models , as well as models of h@xmath53 ( co ) , and star formation in the same volume .",
    "we have developed a simple ` constant @xmath3 disk ' ( cq - disk ) model for predicting the distribution of ism and star formation in galaxies based on the assumption that the two - fluid instability parameter ( @xmath0 ) of the galactic disk is a constant .",
    "the model predicts the gas surface mass density and star formation intensity given the rotation curve , stellar surface mass density and the gas velocity dispersion . in this paper",
    "we compared radial profiles of hi , and h@xmath53 surface mass density and star formation intensity from a sample of 12 galaxies from l08 . in order to optimise our model , we tried various prescriptions for calculating @xmath0 , the ratio @xmath174 , and the star formation law ( sfl ) .",
    "we find that    * the @xmath0 profiles are fairly flat over the intermediate radii of the disk , with variations of a factor of @xmath138 about the mean , no matter which recipe of @xmath0 is employed .",
    "the @xcite formulation of @xmath0 has the strongest physical basis of the recipes we tried , and also marginally the flattest @xmath0 profiles .",
    "however it is the most difficult to implement since it requires the wavelength of the most unstable mode to be derived .",
    "the @xcite approximation , is the most practical recipe for @xmath0 in terms of its very simple form , and the one we have adopted in our model . * we tested three prescriptions of @xmath2 by comparing the observed surface mass densities of neutral and molecular gas with our model predictions .",
    "all three prescriptions produce @xmath72 and @xmath73 profiles that match the observed profiles with typical variations better than a factor of 2 about the mean .",
    "overall , the empirical scaling of @xmath2 with stellar surface mass density ( sr ) proposed by @xcite produces the best fits to both the @xmath72 and @xmath73 profiles , and therefore we favor this model . while the @xcite self - shielding prescription kr produces typically better matches to the @xmath72 profiles than the sr relation , the matches to the @xmath73 profiles are worse .",
    "although the best @xmath149 relation selected here is based on the predicted @xmath117 from our cq - disk model , it is consistent with the l08 results based on observed neutral and molecular ism profiles .",
    "* we tested eight versions of the sfl , five that depend on just the total ism content ( defined as combined neutral and molecular component ) and three that require the ism be separated in to neutral and molecular phases .",
    "the latter three were tested with all three prescriptions of @xmath2 that we trialled .",
    "the linear molecular sfl , sfr@xmath175 produces the best matches to the @xmath74 profiles when used with the sr @xmath2 relation , with the models typically agreeing with the observed profiles to within a factor of 2 .",
    "the two - component sfl sfr@xmath176 , combined with the sr relation does second best with agreement to typically a factor of 2.2 , while the orbital time sfl sfr@xmath153 , at third best in terms of @xmath177 value , is the best of the single component ism sfls with agreement to within a factor of @xmath178 over the intermediate radii disk .",
    "again , the best sfls here are selected based on our model predicted @xmath179 as well as @xmath73 , not the observed gas surface mass densities . however , the results are consistent with those from l08 and @xcite who do use observed ism profiles for their tests .",
    "this consistency also supports our cq - disk model in an indirect way . *",
    "the modelled star formation intensity profiles ( figs [ sfr_s ] , [ sfr_p ] , [ sfr_k ] ) match the observations best at intermediate radii , and show the largest deviations in the central region ( where @xmath180 ) .",
    "this suggest that a more elaborate model is needed to explain the ism and gas distribution in the centres of galaxies , especially those with bulges or a steeply rising rotation curve .",
    "however , integrating the sfr over the entire central region area we find that the models agree with the observations within a factor of 3 in all but one case .",
    "this indicates the systematic discrepancy integrated over galaxy centres generally is not severe .",
    "since we are testing a model for the distribution of star formation and gas in galaxies that we base on inferences from things team results , there is no surprise that our model works well for large portions of galaxies selected from the things sample .",
    "our future papers will test our model on galaxies selected independently .",
    "one advantage of our models is that they are easy to calculate given the rotation curve and the distribution of stellar mass .",
    "this may prove to be a useful advantage in terms of implementation compared to more detailed models like that of @xcite .",
    "however to handle the central regions , some reasonable modifications may be required , such as requiring gas and sfr to only be at @xmath181 for galaxies with @xmath182 above some fiducial value .",
