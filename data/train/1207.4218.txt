    "many quantum computing applications @xcite and quantum communication protocols @xcite , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , are based on the sharing of entangled two - photon states between two distant receiving stations .",
    "the paired photons can be distributed through free space transmission channels , or alternatively , through single - mode fiber optical links . indeed",
    ", fiber optical links are the most practical way to share entanglement between a large number of users .",
    "the polarization degree of freedom is the most widely used resource to generate entanglement between two distant parties .",
    "polarization - entangled photons can be generated by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , a nonlinear optical process in which two lower - frequency photons ( signal and idler ) are generated when a strong pump interacts with the atoms of a nonlinear material .",
    "subsequently to the generation , each photon constituting a pair can propagate through a different single - mode fiber , with the initial degree of entanglement between the photons being preserved over long distances @xcite .",
    "one application that is attracting a lot of interest due its potential key role in the newly emerging quantum communication networks is the multi - user quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite . in order to implement a multi - user qkd network , various frequency channels",
    "can expediently be employed for transmitting individual entangled pairs . in this way , one can re - route on demand specific channels between users located in different sites of the optical network .",
    "similar schemes , considering the emission of photon pairs in different spectral and spatial modes , have been presented in @xcite for an on - demand single - photon source based on a single crystal .    to prepare polarization - entangled paired photons in many frequency channels at the same time , one needs to engineer an spdc process with an ultra - broad spectrum .",
    "usually type - i or type-0 configurations are preferred . with the type - ii phase - matching ,",
    "the two down - converted photons have different polarizations and consequently different group velocities , which reduces dramatically their bandwidth .",
    "for instance , the fwhm bandwidth of an spdc process in a type - ii periodically - poled ( pp ) ktp crystal at @xmath0 nm is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the length of the crystal @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 mm , the bandwidth is @xmath4 nm . on the other hand , in a type-0 ppln configuration with the same crystal length @xmath3 mm , lim et al .",
    "@xcite achieved an approximate tenfold increase of the bandwidth @xmath5 nm . even though one can always reduce the length of the nonlinear crystal in a type - ii configuration to achieve an increase of the bandwidth , this results in a reduction of the spectral brightness of the source .",
    "alternatively to short bulk crystals , bragg reflection waveguides ( brws ) based on iii - v ternary semiconductor alloys ( al@xmath6ga@xmath7as ) offer the possibility to generate polarization - entangled photons with an ultra - large bandwidth . the most striking feature of the use of brw as a photon source is the capability of controlling the dispersive properties of all interacting waves in the spdc process , which in turn allows the tailoring of the bandwidth of the down - converted photons : from narrowband ( @xmath8 nm ) to ultra - broadband ( hundreds of nm ) @xcite , considering both type - i and type - ii configurations .",
    "therefore , one can design a type - ii spdc process in brws with a bandwidth typical for type - i or type-0 processes .",
    "the utilization of bragg reflection waveguide ( brw ) has further advantages over other conventional spdc sources due to the large nonlinear coefficient of semiconductors ( @xmath9 pm / v ) @xcite , broad transparency window ( @xmath10 - @xmath11 m ) and mature fabrication technologies that can be used for integration of the source of entangled photons with a light source and other optical elements .",
    "additionally , a laser based on brws has already been demonstrated @xcite , opening a door for the integration in a single chip of the pump light source together with the brw , where the down - converted photons are generated @xcite .",
    "al@xmath6ga@xmath7as is an optically isotropic semiconductor , precluding birefringent phase matching .",
    "however , the modal phase - matching of the interacting waves ( pump , signal and idler ) can be achieved by letting each wave propagate in a different type of mode supported by the waveguide .",
    "for instance , the phase - matching can be successfully achieved if the pump propagates in the waveguide in a bragg mode , whereas the signal and idler photons propagate in total - internal - reflection ( tir ) modes @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the potential of the proposed design for generating wavelength - multiplexed polarization - entangled photon pairs over many frequency channels , let us examine the biphoton generation in a collinear type - ii phase - matching scheme in the bragg reflection waveguide ( see fig .",

    "the function @xmath38 is proportional to the probability of detection of a photon with polarization te and frequency @xmath39 in coincidence with a photon with tm polarization and frequency @xmath40 .",

    "( [ sigma ] ) shows that the effective nonlinearity @xmath75 of the waveguide spdc process depends on the effective area ( @xmath76 ) , which is related to the spatial overlap of the pump , signal and idler modes . for the structure considered ,",
    "the effective area exhibits only minimal frequency dependence in the bandwidth of interest and it is equal to @xmath77  @xmath78 .",
    "despite the fact that the large effective area will reduce the strength of the interaction , the high nonlinear coefficient still results in an efficiency that is a much higher than for other phase - matching platforms in waveguides or in bulk media . the total emission rate @xcite can be expressed using eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) as @xmath79 . for our brw , the emission rate is @xmath80  @xmath81 . for comparison , for a typical ppln waveguide ( type-0 )",

    "( [ eg3 ] ) , is displayed in fig .",
    "even though we are considering a type - ii configuration , the width ( fwhm ) of the spectrum is a staggering @xmath83 nm .    the degree of entanglement in each spectral channel can be quantified by calculating the concurrence @xmath84 of the biphoton @xcite .",
    "the concurrence is equal to 0 for a separable state and to 1 for a maximally entangled state . for the density matrix of eq .",
    "( [ state3 ] ) we obtain @xcite",
    "@xmath85 so the degree of entanglement depends on the symmetry of the spectral amplitude @xmath86 , i.e. , if @xmath87 the concurrence is maximum .",
    "( solid line ) , @xmath88 ( dashed line ) and @xmath89(dotted - and - dashed line ) as a function of the frequency channel . ]",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath84 for the first 200 channels .",
    "@xmath90 is reached for the first 179 channels . the decrease ( increase ) of the parameters",
    "@xmath89 ( @xmath88 ) reflects the fact that for frequency channels with a large detuning from the central frequency , one of the two polarization components of the polarization entangled state , @xmath91 or @xmath92 , shows a greater amplitude probability . in this case ,",
    "one of the two options predominates .",
    "therefore , if the goal is to generate a quantum state of the form @xmath93 in a specific frequency channel with @xmath94 , one can always modify the diagonal elements of the density matrix with a linear transformation optical system , keeping unaltered the degree of entanglement .",
    "the number of frequency channels available depends on the concurrence required for the specific application .",
    "a good example is a linear optical gate relying on the interference of photons on a beam splitter @xcite",
    ". this would be especially important for the implementation of quantum teleportation , where the fidelity of the protocol depends strongly on the spectral indistinguishably between polarizations of the entangled state @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the number of frequency channels available as a function of the minimum concurrence required .",
    "for instance , if we select only frequency channels with @xmath95 , we have at our disposal @xmath96 channels , while for @xmath97 this number is reduced to @xmath98 channels .        in the implementation of the system considered here in a _",
    "real _ fiber - optics network , the number of frequency channels available can be limited by several factors .",
    "for instance , it can be limited by the operational bandwidth of the demultiplexer ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this device should be designed to operate with the same broad spectral range of the photon pairs generated in the brw waveguide .    when using a large number of channels , inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that channels far apart from the central frequency will exhibit a lower brightness . in this case ,",
    "spectral shapers or appropriately designed filters , should be used to flatten the emission spectrum , similarly to the case of broadband gain - flattened erbium doped fiber amplifiers ( edfa ) .",
    "notwithstanding , this might introduce some losses in the generation process , especially when considering a large number of channels , deteriorating the flux rate of the source .",
    "interestingly , a similar problem appears in the context of optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , where large bandwidths are required to increase the imaging resolution . in oct ,",
    "spectral shapers are used to obtain an optimum ( gaussian - like ) spectral shape @xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention that the generation of polarization - entangled photons with the large bandwidths considered here require a precise control the group velocities of the interacting waves , which in turn requires a precise control of the waveguide parameters : refractive index and layer widths .",
    "the effective number of available frequency channels in a specific application is inevitably linked to the degree of control of the fabrication process . since both down - converted photons are propagating as tir modes , they are more resistant to fabrication imperfections . for example , a change of about 10@xmath99 in the aluminium concentration in the core will reduce the spectral bandwidth to @xmath100 nm .",
    "notwithstanding , it has to be stressed that the phase - matching condition for interacting waves is highly sensitive to any fabrication imperfection , therefore any small change of the structural parameters will lead to a shift of the central ( phase - matched ) wavelength .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a new type of highly efficient waveguide source for generating polarization - entangled photon pairs for its use in multi - frequency qkd networks . in spite of being a type - ii spdc source ,",
    "the achieved bandwidth is even larger than the bandwidth usually obtained with type - i or type-0 sources .",
    "the key enabling factor that allows us to achieve high efficiency of the nonlinear process together with a bandwidth increase is the fact that we can use a longer nonlinear material in a type - ii configuration , while at the same time keeping the broadband nature of the spdc process through the appropriate design of the bragg reflection waveguide structure .    even though _ conventional _",
    "sources based on the use of more common nonlinear materials , such as ktp or linbo@xmath101 , might also generate entangled pairs of photons with a large bandwidth , brws based on algaas compounds offer two main advantages : an enhanced capability to tailor the general properties of the downconverted photons , and the possibility of integration of different elements ( pump source , nonlinear waveguide and diverse optical elements ) in a chip platform based on an already mature technology , which could pave the way for entanglement - based technologies in _ out - of - the - lab scenarios_.",
