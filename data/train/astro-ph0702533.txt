    "after a protoneutron star ( pns ) is successfully formed in a supernova explosion , neutrinos are temporarily trapped within the star ( prakash et al .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the pns is strongly dependent on the stellar composition , which is mainly determined by the number of trapped neutrinos , and by thermal effects with values of temperatures up to 30 - 40 mev ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ; pons et al .",
    "hence , the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter at finite temperature is crucial for studying the macrophysical evolution of protoneutron stars .",
    "+ the dynamical transformation of a pns into a ns could be strongly influenced by a phase transition to quark matter in the central region of the star .",
    "calculations of pns structure , based on a microscopic nucleonic equation of state ( eos ) , indicate that for the heaviest pns , close to the maximum mass ( about two solar masses ) , the central particle density reaches values larger than @xmath0 . in this density range the nucleon cores ( dimension @xmath1 ) start to touch each other , and it is likely that quark degrees of freedom will play a role .",
    "+ in this work we will focus on a possible hadron - quark phase transition .",
    "in fact , as in the case of cold ns , the addition of hyperons demands for the inclusion of quark degrees of freedom in order to obtain a maximum mass larger than the observational lower limit . for this purpose",
    "we use the brueckner - bethe - goldstone ( bbg ) theory of nuclear matter , extended to finite temperature , for describing the hadronic phase and the mit bag model at finite temperature for the quark matter ( qm ) phase . we employ both a constant and a density - dependent bag parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the presence of qm increases the value of the maximum mass of a pns , and stabilizes it at about 1.51.6 @xmath3 , no matter the value of the temperature .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s : qm ]",
    "we present a new static model for pns .",
    "section [ s2:qm ] is devoted to the description of the hadron - quark phase transition within the eos mentioned above . in section [ s3:qm ]",
    "we present the results about the structure of hybrid pns and , finally , we draw our conclusions .",
    "calculations of static models of protoneutron stars should be considered as a first step to describe these objects . in principle",
    "the temperature profile has to be determined via dynamical calculations taking into account neutrino transport properly @xcite .",
    "many static approaches have been developed in the past decade @xcite@xcite , implementing several finite temperature eos and assuming an isentropic or an isothermal @xcite profile throughout the star .",
    "+ in our model we assume that a pns in its early stage is composed of a hot , neutrino opaque , and isothermal core separated from an outer cold crust by an isentropic , neutrino - free intermediate layer , which will be called the envelope throughout the paper .      for a pns core",
    "in which the strongly interacting particles are only baryons , its composition is determined by requirements of charge neutrality and equilibrium under weak semileptonic processes , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are baryons and @xmath8 is a lepton ( either an electron or a muon ) . under the condition that neutrinos are trapped in the system ,",
    "the beta equilibrium equations read explicitly @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the baryon number , and @xmath11 the electric charge of the species @xmath12 . because of trapping , the numbers of leptons per baryon of each flavour ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 , are conserved .",
    "gravitational collapse calculations of the iron core of massive stars indicate that , at the onset of trapping , the electron lepton number is @xmath15 ; since no muons are present at this stage we can impose also @xmath16 . for neutrino",
    "free matter we just set @xmath17 in eq.([betaeq ] ) and neglect the above constraints on lepton numbers . + we assume a constant value of temperature throughout the core and perform some calculations for a value of temperature ranging from 0 to 50 mev , with and without neutrinos .",
    "the eos employed is that of the bhf approach at finite temperature for the hadron phase and that of the mit bag model for qm .",
    "many more details on the nuclear matter eos employed together with plots for the chemical composition and pressure at increasing density and temperature can be found in @xcite .",
    "+      the condition of isothermality adopted for the core can not be extended to the outer part of the star .",
    "dynamical calculations suggest that the temperature drops rapidly to zero at the surface of the star ; this is due to the fast cooling of the outer part of the pns where the stellar matter is transparent to neutrinos .",
    "moreover , in the early stage , the outer part of a pns is characterized by a high value of the entropy per baryon ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 in units of boltzmann s constant @xcite . + for a low enough core temperature ( @xmath20 mev ) in @xcite a temperature profile in the shape of a step function was assumed , joining the hadronic eos ( bhf ) with the bps @xcite plus fmt @xcite eos for the cold crust .",
    "when the core temperature @xmath21 is greater than @xmath19 mev , we consider an isentropic envelope in the range of baryon density from @xmath22 @xmath23 to @xmath24 @xmath23 based on the eos of ls @xcite with the incompressibility modulus of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath25 mev ( ls220 ) . within this eos , fixing the entropy per baryon @xmath26 to the above values ( @xmath27 ) and imposing beta - equilibrium ( neutrino - free regime ) we get temperature profiles which rise quikly from @xmath28 ( at @xmath22 @xmath23 ) to values of temperature typical of the hot interior of a pns ( respectively @xmath29 mev ) at a baryon density of about @xmath24 @xmath23 .",
    "this explicitly suggests a natural correspondance between the entropy of the envelope @xmath30 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "+ since the energy of neutrinos , emerging from the interior , possesses some spreading @xcite and their transport properties vary quite a lot during the pns evolution @xcite , we do not think that the location of the neutrino - sphere , affected by the same spreading , is a good criterion to fix the matching density between core and envelope .",
    "all this instead indicates the possibility to have a blurred region inside the star where we are free to choose the matching density . to build up our model of pns ,",
    "a fine tuning of @xmath30 is performed in order to have an exact matching between core and envelope of all the thermodynamic quantities ( energy density , free energy density , and temperature ) . in this sense",
    "we can consider this static description of pns with only one free parameter : the temperature of the core .",
    "once @xmath21 is chosen , @xmath30 is fixed by matching conditions ( see @xcite for more details and results on pure baryonic pns ) .",
    "we review briefly the description of the bulk properties of uniform qm at finite temperature , deconfined from the beta - stable hadronic matter discussed in the previous section , by using the mit bag model @xcite . in its simplest form , the quarks are considered to be free inside a bag and the thermodynamic properties are derived from the fermi gas model , where the quark @xmath31 baryon density and the energy density , are given by _",
    "q = [ e : rhoq ] + _ q = g _ q e_q(k ) + b [ e : epsq ] where @xmath32 is the quark degeneracy , @xmath33 , @xmath2 is the bag constant and @xmath34 are the fermi distribution functions for the quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "we have used massless @xmath35 and @xmath36 quarks , and @xmath37 mev .",
    "it has been found @xcite that within the mit bag model ( without color superconductivity ) with a density - independent bag constant @xmath2 , the maximum mass of a ns can not exceed a value of about 1.6 solar masses .",
    "indeed , the maximum mass increases as the value of @xmath2 decreases , but too small values of @xmath2 are incompatible with a hadron - quark transition density @xmath38 23 @xmath39 in nearly symmetric nuclear matter , as demanded by heavy - ion collision phenomenology . in order to overcome these restrictions of the model",
    ", one can introduce a density - dependent bag parameter @xmath40 , and this approach was followed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to lower the value of @xmath2 at large density , providing a stiffer qm eos and increasing the value of the maximum mass , while at the same time still fulfilling the condition of no phase transition below @xmath41 in symmetric matter . in the following we present results based on the mit model using both a constant value of the bag parameter , @xmath42 , and a gaussian parametrization for the density dependence , = b_+ ( b_0 - b_)[eq : param ] with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ,",
    "see ref .",
    "the introduction of a density - dependent bag has to be taken into account properly for the computation of various thermodynamical quantities ; in particular the quark chemical potentials @xmath46 and the pressure @xmath47 are modified as _",
    "_ q + , [ murho ] p p + .",
    "nevertheless , due to a cancelation of the second term in ( [ murho ] ) , occurring in relations ( [ betaeq ] ) for the beta - equilibrium , the composition at a given total baryon density remains unaffected by this term ( and is in fact independent of @xmath2 ) . at this stage of investigation ,",
    "we disregard possible dependencies of the bag parameter on temperature and individual quark densities . for a more extensive discussion of this topic ,",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "+ the individual quark chemical potentials are fixed by eq .",
    "( [ betaeq ] ) with @xmath48 , which implies:@xmath49 .",
    "the charge neutrality condition and the total baryon number conservation together with the constraints on the lepton number @xmath50 conservation allow us to determine the composition @xmath51 and then the pressure of the qm phase . in both phases",
    "the contribution of leptons is that of a fermi gas . in the range of temperature considered here ( @xmath52 mev )",
    "thermal effects are rather weak , the presence of neutrinos instead influences quite strongly the composition : in this case the relative fraction of @xmath35 quarks increases substantially from @xmath53 to about @xmath54 , compensating the charge of the electrons that are present at an average percentage of @xmath55 throughout the considered range of baryon density , whereas @xmath36 and @xmath26 quark fractions are slightly lowered ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+        we now consider the hadron - quark phase transition in beta - stable matter at finite temperature . in the present work we adopt the simple maxwell construction for the phase transition from the plot of pressure versus chemical potential .",
    "the more general glendenning ( gibbs ) construction @xcite is still affected by many theoretical uncertainties and in any case influences very little the final mass - radius relations of massive ( proto)neutron stars @xcite .",
    "we therefore display in figs .",
    "[ f : pc ] the pressure @xmath47 ( upper panels ) and baryon density @xmath56 ( lower panels ) as functions of the baryon chemical potential @xmath57 for both baryonic and qm phases at temperatures @xmath58 mev .",
    "the crossing points of the baryon and quark pressure curves ( marked with a dot ) represent the transitions between baryon and qm phases .",
    "the projections of these points ( dotted lines ) on the baryon and quark density curves in the lower panels indicate the corresponding transition densities from low - density baryonic matter , @xmath59 , to high - density qm , @xmath60 .",
    "+ the main aspects of the eos for such stellar matter are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : pe ] and are well summarized as follows .",
    "the transition density @xmath59 is rather low , of the order of the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the phase transition density jump @xmath61 is large , several times @xmath59 , and the model with density - dependent bag parameter predicts larger transition densities @xmath59 and larger jumps @xmath61 than those with bag constant @xmath42 .",
    "the plateaus in the maxwell construction are thus wider for the former case .",
    "thermal effects and neutrino trapping shift @xmath59 to lower values of subnuclear densities and increase the density jump @xmath61 . for the cold case",
    "the presence of neutrinos even inhibits completely the phase transition @xcite .     +",
    "the stable configurations of a pns can be obtained from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of tolman , oppenheimer , and volkov @xcite for the pressure @xmath62 and the gravitational mass @xmath63 , once the eos @xmath64 is specified , being @xmath65 the total energy density .",
    "we schematize the entire evolution of a pns as divided in two main stages . in the first , representing the early stage , the pns is in a hot ( @xmath66 mev )",
    "stable configuration with a neutrino - trapped core and a high - entropy envelope ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the second stage represents the end of the short - term cooling where the neutrino - free core possesses a low temperature ( @xmath68 mev ) and the outer part can be considered as a cold crust ( bps+fmt ) .",
    "+ the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : mc ] , where we display the gravitational mass @xmath69 ( in units of the solar mass @xmath3 ) as a function of the radius @xmath70 ( right panels ) and the central baryon density @xmath71 ( left panels ) , for qm eos with @xmath42 and @xmath40 , respectively . due to the use of the maxwell construction ,",
    "the curves are not continuous @xcite .",
    "pns in our approach are thus practically hybrid stars and the heaviest ones have only a thin outer layer of baryonic matter . for completeness",
    "we display the complete set of results at core temperatures @xmath72 with and without neutrino trapping , although only the curves with high temperatures and neutrino trapping and low temperatures without trapping are the physically relevant ones .",
    "we observe in any case a surprising insensitivity of the results to the presence of neutrinos , in particular for the @xmath42 case , which can be traced back to the fact that the qm eos @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ f : pe ] is practically insensitive to the neutrino fraction ( see @xcite for more details ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the curves is quite pronounced for intermediate and low - mass stars , showing a strong increase of the minimum mass with temperature , whereas the maximum mass remains practically constant under all possible circumstances . above core temperatures of about 4050 mev all stellar configurations",
    "become unstable . concerning the dependence on the qm eos",
    ", we observe again only a slight variation of the maximum pns masses between @xmath74 for @xmath42 and @xmath75 for @xmath40 .",
    "clearer differences exist for the radii , which for the same mass and temperature are larger for the @xmath42 model .",
    "in conclusion , in this article we have extended a previous work on baryonic pns @xcite to the case of hybrid pns .",
    "we combined the most recent microscopic baryonic eos in the bhf approach involving nuclear three - body forces and hyperons with two versions of a generalized mit bag model for qm .",
    "the eos employed for both phases are checked by phenomenological constraints .",
    "+ we modelled the entropy and temperature profile of a pns in a simplified way taking as much as possible care about results coming from dynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to study the stability of a pns varying both the temperature of the core and the central density .",
