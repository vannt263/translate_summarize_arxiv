    "when the boundaries of an elastic sheet are sufficiently distorted , singular deformations in the sheet often occur  @xcite .",
    "these singularities are immediately apparent when one crumples a sheet of paper between the hands .",
    "analogous singularities occur whenever the sheet is forced to have points of high curvature  @xcite .",
    "one can readily form such a `` puckered '' sheet by fastening the edges of that sheet to form disclinations as shown in the cube of fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "recently it has been recognized that such structures typically have their energy concentrated into so - called stretching ridges , in which strain and curvature energies are in balance  @xcite .",
    "the ridge increases the stored elastic energy in the structure dramatically relative to that of a uniformly curved sheet occupying the same region .",
    "this enhancement of energy grows as a power of the linear size of the structures relative to the thickness of the sheet .",
    "the large energy content of these structures suggests that they should be strong .",
    "they should resist deformation and buckling under external loads qualitatively better than nonsingular structures . in this note",
    "we demonstrate this strength by showing that the scaling laws governing the ridge energy also predict its response to loads and its buckling threshold .",
    "we simulate the compression of an elastic cubic shell by the application of external , inward - pointing forces at its vertices .",
    "the cube is formed from a flat sheet as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] . with this connectivity",
    "the sheet naturally forms stretching ridges along the edges of the cube .",
    "we push on the vertices of the cube until the ridges buckle into several smaller ridges . by rescaling the compressed configuration with the same thickness scaling laws as those appropriate for the resting configuration , we demonstrate that the response of the ridge to this kind of forcing is completely described by the @xmath0 power ridge scaling solution determined in  @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrate that the onset of the buckling instability follows this scaling as well .",
    "ridge scaling comes about as a way to balance bending and stretching energy costs .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the important dimesionless parameter governing the elastic energy of a single ridge of length @xmath1 and material thickness @xmath2 is the aspect ratio @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-dimensional young s modulus of the material , @xmath6 is an effective bending modulus , and @xmath7 is its poisson ratio . if all lengths are expressed in units of @xmath1 and all energies in units of @xmath6 , the equilibrium configurations of a thin sheet are completely described by a dimensionless form of the von krmn equations , @xmath8 + p , \\",

    "the bracket product represents @xmath11 = \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu }",
    "\\epsilon_{\\beta\\nu } \\left ( \\partial_\\alpha \\partial_\\beta a \\right ) \\left ( \\partial_\\mu \\partial_\\nu b \\right),\\ ] ] @xmath12 is an arbitrary external pressure field acting normal to the surface ( in units of @xmath13 ) , and the potential fields are related to the curvature @xmath14 and stress @xmath15 by @xmath16 this form of @xmath15 automatically satisfies the equilibrium condition @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 comes into the von krmn equations multiplying the stess source term , the possible configurations of a thin elastic sheet are well described by a stress free , @xmath19 folding solution plus boundary layers at the fold lines .",
    "lobkovsky s insight in  @xcite was to try a scaling solution for the boundary layer of a single ridge which matched the @xmath20 scaling of the outer , sharp fold solution . for a fold of dihedral angle @xmath21 across the line @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "accordingly , on the boundary layer @xmath20 should scale with the same power of @xmath18 as the dimensionless transverse coordinate @xmath10 . substituting a scaling form into the dimensionless von krmn equations with @xmath24 and equating the highest order terms yields scaling of the form @xmath25 where the tildes denote dimensionless , scale free coordinates and functions .",
    "this translates to @xmath26 scaling of the boundary layer width , @xmath27 scaling of the transverse ridge curvature , and @xmath28 scaling of the strain along the ridge length .",
    "external forcing applied to the sheet enters the von krmn equations via the term @xmath12 and via boundary conditions at the sheet s edges . in this research",
    "we consider an external potential which essentially applies point forces to either end of a ridge .",
    "since the spatial extent of the applied force is a delta function we do not expect it to destroy the spatial scaling of the ridge solution .",
    "therefore we may reasonably expect to find that the equilibrium configuration of a ridge under a given compressive force is identical to rescaled configurations of ridges with different material thickness and properly rescaled external force magnitudes .    to calculate the proper rescaling of the forces on the vertices for a similarity solution",
    ", we consider our forcing as a boundary condition consisting mainly of an in - plane point force",
    ". this force amounts to a point stress at the edge of the sheet with the form @xmath29 so , to find similar scaled configurations of the sheet , we must scale @xmath30 the same way @xmath31 scales on the ridge . since @xmath32 scales as @xmath28 , and @xmath33 then @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a dimensionless , scale free function . to express @xmath30 in similar fashion , we substitute the scale free @xmath36-variable @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the proper scale free force can be written in terms of @xmath39 as @xmath40    for reasons which will become clear in the next section , we can not measure the force we apply to our ridge with very good accuracy .",
    "however , we can measure the inward displacement @xmath41 of the ridge ends caused by this forcing .",
    "these two quantities may be related by assuming that the work done by equivalent rescaled forces , given approximately by @xmath42 , scales the same as the total energy of the resting ridge configuration .",
    "the total energy of a resting ridge scales as @xmath43 , so equivalent values of @xmath44 will scale as @xmath27 . given the scaling of @xmath45 from eq.[eq : ftildeo ] ,",
    "the scale free @xmath46 must be related to the actual displacement by @xmath47",
    "to test these scaling predictions we simulate a flat elastic sheet joined to form a cube as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "the sheet is a triangular grid with variable grid spacing .",
    "strains and curvature are taken to be constant across the face of each triangle , with curvature calculated relative to the local normal at each triangle . bending and",
    "stretching energies were assigned to the curvature and strains on each triangle using the forms for elastic energy presented in  @xcite for a sheet of elastic thickness @xmath2 and poisson ratio @xmath0 . the gridding was chosen to have smooth gradients in triangle density over most of the surface while concentrating the lattice spacing at the vertices by a factor of @xmath48 and across the ridge - line by a factor of @xmath49 compared to the flat regions far from the ridge .",
    "the concentrations factors were chosen arbitrarily , within the limits of the mapping , to make the gridding near the vertices as fine as possible . pushing on the tips of the cube",
    "is accomplished by introducing repulsive potentials of the form @xmath50 centered around points @xmath51 which lie just outside the vertices of the cube . to prevent rotation ,",
    "the vertices are explicitly constrained to lie on radial lines that pass through the center of the cube and the points @xmath52 which define the vertices of a perfect cube .",
    "the center points of the pushing potentials are located on these radial lines , at the point where the vertex would lie if the sheet were sharply folded at the ridges  relaxation of the ridge curvature draws the vertices inward from these points for an unforced resting ridge .",
    "this potential concentrates the forces at the corners without creating lattice - scale numerical instabilities .",
    "@xmath53 was varied to apply different loading .",
    "an inverse gradient routine  @xcite was used to minimize the total elastic and potential energy of the sheet as a function of the coordinates of all the lattice points for given parameters @xmath6,@xmath4 and @xmath53 .    to save computational time ,",
    "energy was computed and minimized on only one ridge - line ( the diamond shaped region highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] ) .",
    "the positions of points on the rest of the cube were calculated by reflection across symmetry planes .",
    "this constraint explicitly required that the edges of the simulated region be confined to the symmetry reflection planes .",
    "thus many forms of deformation that break the symmetry of the resting state are not possible in the simulation .",
    "however , the minimization may break the left - right symmetry of the diamond - shaped region , and we found that it does so to a slight degree .",
    "the assymmetry shows up in our reconstruction as a slight mismatch in other faces of the cube , as noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "we do not believe these mismatches are important for the scaling phenomena we report .",
    "we found minimum energy configurations for ridges of aspect ratio @xmath18 ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath18 was determined by the range of validity of the ridge scaling solution  above this value",
    "the width of the ridge becomes comparable to that the sheet . at the other extreme",
    ", for @xmath56 the radius of curvature at the ridge line becomes comparable to the spacing of our lattice and the simulation ceases to be accurate .",
    "for each value of @xmath18 we first found the minimum energy configuration with no applied forces .",
    "this configuration was then used as the initial condition to find minimum total energy configurations for the ridge in the presence of the tip - pushing potential described in the numerics section .",
    "we made the tip - forcing progressively stronger by increasing the potential coefficient @xmath53 in constant steps , each time evolving the grid to an energy minimizing configuration .",
    "the forcing was increased until the ridge buckled .",
    "buckling of the ridge was marked by the appearance of new points of sharp curvature along the ridge as well as a sudden decrease in the total _",
    "energy @xmath57 of the sheet .",
    "thus the unbuckled sheet is _",
    "metastable_. we made no attempt to scale the size of the potential step with the thickness of the sheet , so while it took nearly @xmath58 steps to buckle the ridge in thicker sheets , it only took @xmath59 or @xmath60 steps for the thinnest sheets .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] shows scaling of the total elastic energy in the cube versus @xmath18 for ridges at rest ( @xmath61 ) and at the buckling threshold .",
    "scaling of the total elastic energy for the resting configuration is consistent with a @xmath43 dependence , in agreement with prior theory and simulation  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] also shows that the elastic energy measured at the buckling threshhold exhibits _ exactly the same _ scaling as on resting ridges .",
    "this suggests that the response of the cube to our tip - forcing is completely determined by the ridge , and that the particular form of our forcing potential does not destroy the length scaling of the ridge .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] shows that that the energy correction at the buckling threshold is nearly a constant fraction of the total ridge elastic energy .",
    "scaling of the force response is verified by the demonstration presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaling ] of a similarity solution for ridge shape . plot ( a ) in this figure shows values of @xmath62 , along a line in the material coordinates which bisects the simulated ridge line , for several different sheet thicknesses and two different values of rescaled ridge tip displacement @xmath41 .",
    "we tested values of @xmath41 which spanned the ridge response from zero forcing to the point of buckling .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath62 was rescaled by @xmath63 and the @xmath36 coordinate was rescaled by @xmath64 .",
    "we found that the rescaled @xmath62 profiles mapped onto each other best if the values of @xmath41 used for each sheet thickness were determine by rescaling @xmath65 , the value used for the thickest sheet , by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the aspect ratio of the thickest sheet .",
    "for comparison , the unscaled @xmath62 versus @xmath36 for a particular rescaled @xmath41 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaling](b ) .",
    "the rescaling exponents used for @xmath62 and @xmath36 were taken from the ridge scaling solution .",
    "the @xmath41 rescaling exponent is very close to the theoretical value of @xmath68 derived above .",
    "we have demonstrated scaling of the ridge response to a typical form of external forcing . since the buckling threshold of the ridge under external forcing",
    "is determined by the energy scaling of the resting ridge solution , the relatively high elastic energy content of very thin ridges translates directly into increased ridge strength .",
    "we are actively pursuing a better understanding of the buckling properties of this distinctive elastic structure ."
