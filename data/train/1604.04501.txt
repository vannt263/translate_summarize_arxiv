    "the in - plane strain anisotropy is estimated to be @xmath101 .",
    "axes of the anisotropic strain fields , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , were carefully aligned along the gaas crystal axis [ 110 ] and [ 1 - 10 ] respectively .",
    "owing to the zinc blende crystal structure of the gaas , the applied anisotropic strain fields induce anisotropic stresses @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the [ 110 ] and [ 1 - 10 ] directions of the diode nanomembrane .",

    "is applied to self - assembled in(ga)as / gaas quantum dots ( qds ) , the tuning behaviors of the fine structure splitting ( fss , @xmath0 ) and the polarization angle , @xmath15 , can be well explained by employing the uniaxial stress dependent exciton hamiltonian proposed by m. gong et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we consider the impact of the vertical electric field , @xmath2 , on the fine structure splitting ( fss , @xmath0 ) , and the exciton poalrization direction ( @xmath15 ) in our device .",
    "in fact , the effect of a vertical electric field is equivalent to the uniaxial stress along the [ 110 ] direction according to the symmetry analysis @xcite .",
    "as already demonstrated in experiment , application of the vertical electric field would induce a coherent coupling between the two bright exciton states , which subsequently results in the suppression of the fss @xcite . by combining the vertical - electric - field dependent exciton two - level hamiltonian developed by a. j. bennett and co - workers @xcite",
    ", we obtain the effective hamiltonian in the space spanned by the two bright exciton states      where @xmath111 is the energy for the degenerated bright exciton states of the qd without broken structure symmetry ; @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) and @xmath18 are parameters related to the external uniaxial stress , @xmath23 is proportional to the difference of the exciton dipole moments @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath19 are determined by the qd mesoscopic structural asymmetry .",

    "@xcite , for stress @xmath11 aligned along with the gaas [ 1 - 10 ] ( [ 110 ] ) direction , we have @xmath117 according to symmetry analysis . in the meantime , the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 can be simply deduced by using the experimentally observed fss @xmath31 and the exciton polarization angle @xmath37 at @xmath120 : @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "most importantly , provided the uniaxial stress is precisely aligned along the gaas [ 1 - 10 ] ( [ 110 ] ) direction , @xmath118 determines the minimum fss tuned by @xmath11 , while @xmath119 determines the magnitude of the critical uniaxial stress at which the minimum fss is obtained . since our @xmath119 shows a linear dependence on the vertical electric field ,",

    "considering our specific experimental arrangement , the approximately uniaxial stress is intentionally aligned along the [ 1 - 10 ] direction of the gaas and therefore it gives @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , as presented in the supplementary note 1 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 account for the qd structural asymmetry and they can be determined experimentally by the initial fss ( @xmath31 ) and the polarization angle ( @xmath37 ) at @xmath21 kv @xmath22 .",

    "<S> this probabilistic nature would cause errors in quantum algorithm protocols and thus fundamentally limits successful use of such sources in deterministic quantum applications @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> realization of entanglement swapping with qds encounters two main challenges : elimination of the energetic splitting between the two bright exciton ( x ) states known as the fine structure splitting ( fss ) @xcite , and energy tuning of emitted photons simultaneously . despite the great success of eliminating the fss ( @xmath0 ) by employing a variety of post - growth tuning techniques such as in - plane magnetic field @xcite , anisotropic strain fields @xcite and optical stack effect @xcite , the reported qds entangled - photon sources are usually restricted to different emission energies due to the lack of simultaneous control over the energy of entangled - photon emission .  </S>",
    "<S> this hurdle becomes the main obstacle impeding bell state measurements between entangled photons emitted by remote qds . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the real potential of qds for entanglement swapping can be harnessed only when a tight control over the energy of entangled - photon emission is achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been reported recently that energy - tunable entangled - photon emission from qds can be achieved by applying two or three independent strain fields using microstructured piezoactuators @xcite .  however , on - demand generation of energy - tunable entangled - photon pairs has not been demonstrated .  </S>",

    "<S> considerable benefits of electric - field - induced energy tuning are the high stability and ultrafast response @xcite without hysteresis and creep that unavoidably appears for the strain - field - induced energy tuning @xcite .  in this sense , it is highly desirable to achieve electric - field - induced energy tuning of on - demand entangled - photon emission from qds </S>",

    "<S> electrical contacts are subsequently made in such a way that electric fields can be independently applied to the diode and the pmn - pt actuator @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> although early works used a similar device , it was constrained to only eliminate the fss of qds by using the combination of an electric field and an anisotropic biaxial strain field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extending this work to achieve energy tuning of entangled - photon emission is not straightforward as the anisotropic biaxial strain field can not cancel the fss _ solely _ @xcite .  here , instead </S>",

    "<S> the energy shift induced by @xmath2 is due to the qcse , while the strain - induced energy shift with @xmath1 is ascribed to the change of the volumetric strain @xmath14 at the qd position @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this significant qd energy tunability , we now present the possibility to achieve energy - field - induced energy tuning for the entangled - photon emission from qds through simultaneous application of the uniaxial stress and the vertical electric field .    in the absence of in - plane magnetic fields , </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that the fss can be universally tuned to zero through application of both the uniaxial stress and the vertical electric field in our device .  </S>",

    "<S> this indicates that the critical uniaxial stress applied to eliminate the fss of qds can be linearly tuned by the vertical electric field . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , energy - tunable entangled - photon emission can be expected from our device .        </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the above two conditions can be satisfied by carefully aligning the gaas crystal axis [ 1 - 10 ] along the axis of the uniaxial stress , and selecting a qd whose exciton polarization angle @xmath28 is precisely aligned along the gaas [ 110 ] ( [ 1 - 10 ] ) direction .  </S>",
    "<S> these two stringent requirements can be verified by monitoring the change of @xmath0 and @xmath15 as @xmath11 is solely applied to the qd . </S>",

    "<S> 2c and 2d show the magnitude of @xmath0 and @xmath15 as a function of @xmath1 at @xmath34 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is found to be 180.23 @xmath35 0.02@xmath36 at @xmath34 , which indicates a precise alignment of the exciton polarization direction along the gaas [ 1 - 10 ] direction ( see methods ) .  </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as @xmath1 is swept from -3.3 to 10 kv  @xmath22 , we find a drastic change in the fss , whereas @xmath15 remains almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that such behaviors can occur only when both of the gaas [ 110 ] ( [ 1 - 10 ] ) direction and the exciton polarization direction are well aligned along the uniaxial stress axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we investigate the change of @xmath0 and @xmath37 as a function of @xmath2 at @xmath13 = 0  v and the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2e and 2f . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a similar behavior for the application of @xmath1 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the fss is obviously reduced while @xmath37 stays almost constant at @xmath38180@xmath36 as @xmath2 is varied . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior further confirms the precise alignment of the exciton polarization direction along the gaas optical axes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in both cases , the fss exhibits a linear change in magnitude with electric fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the gradient is found to be @xmath39 = -2.81 @xmath40 0.05 and @xmath23 = -0.104 @xmath40 0.007 @xmath3ev kv@xmath41 cm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can clearly see that the tuning rate for @xmath1 is approximately 28 times larger than that of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this fss change , the energy shift induced by @xmath1 and @xmath2 shows converse tuning trend . the energy shift due to @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is found to be 4.6 mev , which is much larger than the energy shift of 1.8 mev by @xmath1 . from these direct observations , therefore , it is intuitive to choose @xmath2 as the energy tuning mechanism , and @xmath1 as the fss tuning mechanism in our later studies .        in order to access the minimum fss ( @xmath42 ) of the qd </S>",
    "<S> , we increase @xmath1 to apply larger uniaxial stress to the qd . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a shows the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for five different values of @xmath2 .  </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the magnitude of @xmath0 at different @xmath2 decreases to an almost zero minimum value of @xmath43ev as appropriate uniaxial stresses are applied . </S>",
    "<S> as already predicted in the theory ( see supplementary note 1 and supplementary figure 1 ) , the critical value of @xmath1 at @xmath44 can be continuously shifted with @xmath2 .  </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the behavior of @xmath15 for the five different values of @xmath2 are also investigated , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 is increased , @xmath15 remains unchanged as @xmath0 is far away from its @xmath42 , and then it shows a sharp change as @xmath0 approaches the minimum value . </S>",
    "<S> further increase of @xmath1 leads to an inversion of @xmath15 from 0@xmath36 to 90@xmath36 , which , remarkably , provides an experimental signature that @xmath42 can be experimentally tuned to zero regardless of the limited spectral resolution of the setup .    </S>",
    "<S> equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are used to fit the experimental data as the solid lines show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a and 3b ( see supplementary note 2 and supplementary table 1 ) . from the theory , the minimum fss value for each @xmath2 , following the form @xmath45 sin@xmath46 @xcite , is determined by the initial fss @xmath31 and polarization angle @xmath37 at @xmath1 = 0 kv  @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted values , before varying @xmath1 , are found to be 0.44 @xmath35 0.12 , 0.13 @xmath35 0.10 , 0.26 @xmath35 0.07 , 0.20 @xmath35 0.16 and 0.10 @xmath35 0.14 @xmath3ev for different @xmath2 at -100 , -117 , -133 , -150 and -167 kv  @xmath22 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values are found to be consistent with our experimentally observed values ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . the above theoretical fits and well - predicted values of @xmath42 for different @xmath2 indicate an excellent agreement between our simple model and the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> even more , we extract the fss tuning rate @xmath39 over @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 remains constant at about -2.7 @xmath3ev kv@xmath41 cm , which reflects that the application of @xmath2 does not affect the tuning effects of @xmath1 but only changes the position of the critical stress for @xmath47ev .    instead of using @xmath1 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a plots @xmath0 as a function of the exciton emission energy , @xmath48 , for five different values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that @xmath49 ev can be achieved over a broad spectral range of about 5 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath2 at @xmath50 is shown in fig . 4b .  </S>",
    "<S> this energy shift is well ascribed to the qcse that can be formulated by @xmath51 @xcite , where @xmath52 is the energy in the absence of @xmath2 , @xmath53 is the permanent dipole moment of the qd in the @xmath54 axis , @xmath55 is the polarizability . from the theoretical fit </S>",
    "<S> we can extract @xmath53 = -4.0 @xmath35 0.4 @xmath3ev  cm  kv@xmath41 and @xmath55 = -0.26 @xmath35 0.01 @xmath3ev  @xmath56  kv@xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability to eliminate the fss of the qd and to tune its photon emission energy over a broad range allows us to demonstrate triggered energy - tunable polarization entangled - photon emission from our device . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out polarization - resolved co- and cross - correlations between the xx and x photons emitted by the qd when @xmath0 is tuned to @xmath43ev for the five different values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c shows the polarization - correlation results when the energy of the x photon is tuned to @xmath58 = 1.4068 ev , @xmath59 = 1.4048 v and @xmath60 = 1.4023 ev , corresponding to @xmath2 = -100 , -133 and -167 kv @xmath22 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all of the correlation functions show periodic correlation peaks with a well - separated temporal distance of 13.1 ns , which is consistent with the repetition rate of 76 mhz of the excitation laser , suggesting a triggered generation of the x and xx photon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> as expected for the two - photon polarization entanglement , strong correlations are always observed in the rectilinear @xmath61h , v@xmath62 and diagonal @xmath61d , a@xmath62 basis , while anti - correlation is observed in the circular basis @xmath61r , l@xmath62 for co - polarized two photons ( blue curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for cross - polarized two photons , we obtain anti - correlations in the @xmath61h , v@xmath62 and the @xmath61d , a@xmath62 bases but correlation in the @xmath61r , l@xmath62 basis ( orange curves ) . in order to obtain the entanglement fidelity ( @xmath63 ) to the bell state </S>",

    "<S> they all exceed the classical limit of 0.5 , thus proving triggered and energy - tunable generation of entangled - photon pairs from our device .    in summary , we have demonstrated a viable concept and a facile approach to realize electric - field - induced energy tuning of on - demand entangled - photon emission from a qd . this device consists of an electrically - tunable diode nanomembrane integrated onto the pmn - pt crystal capable of exerting uniaxial stress to qds .  we have experimentally demonstrated electric - field - induced energy tuning of about 5 mev for entangled - photon emission from qds . </S>",
    "<S> high entanglement - fidelities well above 0.72 have been obtained for all tuned energies under the applied vertical electric field , which indicates the entanglement of the qd emitter can be well - preserved in response to the external strain and electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that the energy tuning range is not limited to about 5 mev , and energy shift of about 25 mev is possible for this entangled - photon source when extending the vertical electric field to a range of @xmath76 kv @xmath22 ( see supplementary figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the experimental realization of electric - field control over the energy of entangled - photon emission from qds can alleviate the slow creep effect induced by the strain field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the device demonstrated in this work has practical advantages over other schemes @xcite , thus constituting an important step towards realization of entanglement swapping , as well as other hybrid quantum systems for quantum network applications .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the above newly revealed feature in such hybrid piezoelectric - semiconductor qd devices , we point out that application of the uniaxial stress and the vertical electric field can not `` universally '' eliminate the fss for every qd in the device .  since the gaas [ 1 - 10 ] ( [ 110 ] ) direction is precisely aligned along the uniaxial stress axis , we obtain @xmath77 and @xmath78 from the theory . for the rest of qds </S>",

    "<S> this indicates that experimental realization of @xmath24 for these dots requires an extremely large magnitude of the uniaxial stress . in order to make an universal fss tuning possible , the orientation of the gaas [ 110 ] ( [ 1 - 10 ] ) axis should be slightly rotated away from the uniaxial stress axis . </S>",
    "<S> we leave this for the future experimental study . </S>"
