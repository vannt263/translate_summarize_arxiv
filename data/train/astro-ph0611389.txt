    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , like other galaxies in the local group ( lg ) , represent the best place to study properties of individual stars inhabiting them and from these deduce properties of the galaxies as a whole .",
    "the main advantages are a nearby distance of the systems and a relatively low extinction along the line of sight .",
    "this research aims to obtain a global picture of the history of formation and evolution of galaxies which requires to understand the distribution of age , chemical abundance and kinematics of both stars and gas .",
    "this contribution highlights the importance of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars to make a step forward in the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , towards obtaining a global picture of galaxies of the lg .",
    "there are different galaxy properties that can be inferred from the study of agb stars , among these : their number density constrains the galaxy structure ; the ratio between carbon - rich ( c - rich ) and oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) agb stars , the c / m ratio , constrains the iron abundance ; the @xmath0 magnitude distribution constrains the star formation history of the galaxy , i.e.  using up - to - date theoretical models allows us to derive the mean - age and the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) of the underlying stellar population ( not only of evolved giants ) and with the availability of low- an high - resolution spectra we can constrain their kinematic and chemistry .",
    "the study of how the above quantities vary across the parent galaxy provides crucial information about population gradients .",
    "the first step to use agb stars as probes of galaxy evolution is to select them among other types of stars .",
    "agb stars are easily distinguished from stars in other phases of evolution using colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "for example in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) diagram they occupy a plume above the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) extending to red colours @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared cmd ( @xmath3 , @xmath0 ) provides the additional statistical distinction between c - rich and o - rich agb stars ( @xcite 2006a ) .",
    "c - rich stars are redder and somewhat brighter than o - rich stars .",
    "these can also be distinguished using other criteria ( see groenewegen , _ this proceeding _ ) .",
    "the number density of agb stars across a galaxy often describes a smooth surface distribution similar to the one obtained from , on average older , rgb stars and contrary to the clumpier and irregular distribution traced by younger stars ( @xcite 2000 ; @xcite 2005 ) .",
    "distance indicators such as the mean magnitude of c - rich stars in a narrow range of ( @xmath3 ) colours or the mean magnitude of agb stars in a narrow range of ( @xmath1 ) colours as well as the tip of the rgb have been used to probe the inclination and position angle of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; @xcite 2001 ) and to correct for differential reddening across ngc 6822 ( cioni et al .  _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "the c / m ratio is an important indicator of the distribution of iron across a galaxy . a calibration of this ratio versus the [ fe / h ] abundance shows a spread of @xmath4 dex within each mc and a larger spread across ngc 6822 . in particular",
    ", the metallicity across the lmc decreases radially @xcite .",
    "this result was later confirmed by @xcite using rgb stars . a preliminary study of the distribution of the c / m ratio across the nearby spiral m33 shows metal poor regions tracing the major spiral arms of the galaxy and a @xmath5[fe / h]@xmath6 dex ( cioni et al .  _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "this pattern supports the findings of @xcite of an increasing c / m ratio up to @xmath7 from the centre and a further flattening induced by the flattening of the rotation curve which causes gas mixing ( i.e.  metal enrichment ) at larger distances from the centre .",
    "the observed @xmath0 magnitude distribution of agb stars interpreted using theoretical distributions produced from stellar evolutionary models ( @xcite 2005 , @xcite 2003 ) allows us to measure both the metallicity and the mean - age of the underlying stellar population .",
    "this @xmath0-method has allowed to obtain for the first time a global description of the distribution of these parameters across the mcs ( @xcite 2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "results for the lmc ( * fig .  1 * ; @xcite 2006a ) indicate a stellar population which is younger in the e and in the n and s regions of the inner disk compared to an older population present in the s - w of it as well as in the n of the outer disk .",
    "the bar region has a composite stellar population .",
    "the distribution of metals , in agreement with the distribution suggested by the c / m ratio , shows two central regions with a low metal content compared to a ring - like inner disk region of higher metallicity .",
    "the metallicity is perhaps higher in the e than in the w along this structure . for the smc ( @xcite 2006b ) , a ring - like structure , which appears more metal rich than a s - central region , is also detected . within this ring",
    "the metallicity increases from s - e to n - w from a young to old stellar population .",
    "this effect is perhaps related to the dynamical history of the galaxy or to its structure ( bekki & cioni _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "recent results across another local group irregular galaxy of magellanic type , ngc 6822 ( * fig .  2 * ; cioni et al .",
    "_ in preparation _ ) , show an average stellar population which is about @xmath8 gyr old and metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath9 dex ) .",
    "the bar appears at least @xmath10 gyr younger and more metal rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath11 dex ) than the region immediately around it .",
    "these results already account for the differential reddening present in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the application of the @xmath0-method to the nearby spiral m33 shows a stellar population which , in agreement with previous determinations , is on average @xmath12 gyr old , prior correcting for differential reddening .",
    "this work , currently in progress , seems to indicate that the ne of the galaxy is more obscured than the sw of it .",
    "this finding is presently being checked against distance measurements from the literature and may explain the cause of their disagreement .",
    "galaxies that do not have a numerous intermediate - age component , like sagdig , still produce reasonable results when the @xmath0-method is applied to a confirmed , and more or less complete , sample of c - rich stars ( * fig .  3 * ; gulieuszik et al .",
    "_ in preparation _ )",
    "in fact , we obtain a stellar population on average young ( @xmath13 gyr old ) and metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath14 dex ) .",
    "summarising , the @xmath0 magnitude distribution of agb stars allows us to estimate variations in mean - age and metallicity across galaxies .",
    "modest sample of stars produce satisfactorily results .",
    "this technique will be applied to other galaxies of the lg , as soon as suitable data will become available , but also to more distant systems resolved into stars , especially those systems where only agb stars are these resolved stars .",
    "the study of the stellar population of different galaxies is important to understand the effect of the environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "modern near - infrared instruments resolve agb stars up to about 5 mpc while to reach them in the virgo and fornax clusters galaxies we need an extremely large telescope .",
    "further , a calibration of the @xmath0-method versus the integrated near - infrared light of stellar populations may allow us to study also galaxies where individual stars can not be resolved but for which population gradients can be accessed using integral field units .",
    "although the @xmath0-method provides information about population gradients it is not sufficient to determine absolute ages and metallicities .",
    "moreover , in oder to obtain a global picture of the star formation history we need to account for the three - dimensional geometry of galaxies as well as for their interaction with neighbouring systems .",
    "the determination of these parameters with an unprecedented accuracy across the mcs is the main goal of the vmc survey .",
    "vista is a new wide - field near - infrared telescope soon to be commissioned at the european southern observatory .",
    "the vmc survey aims to collect @xmath15 broad - band photometry across the magellanic system covering entirely the mcs , the bridge and some regions of the stream .",
    "this is a deep survey that will detect sources at @xmath16 with a s / n@xmath17 which is @xmath18 magnitude fainter than the 2mass limit .",
    "it will take about 5 years to cover the proposed area and multi - epoch data , especially in the @xmath0 band , will allow us to determine the mean magnitude of short period variables ( rr lyrae and cepheid stars ) which will be used , among other indicators , to trace the three - dimensional structure of the system .",
    "simulations of the system as a whole combined with the distribution of different density indicators ( i.e. stars of a different type and nature ) will allow us to account for the effect of interactions between the mcs and the milky way .",
    "the vmc survey , of strong legacy value , represents a unique counterpart for optical data with the same sensitivity and also for exploiting spitzer data .",
    "+ vista in the southern and ukirt in the northern hemisphere are truly powerful instruments for the study of lg galaxies .",
    "they allow us to resolve individual stars even in optically crowded regions and because of the wide - field we can efficiently probe substructures ( streams , tidal tails and undiscovered bound entities ) witnessing the history of our group ."
