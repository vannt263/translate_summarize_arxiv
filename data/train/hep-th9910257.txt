    "<S> we consider an abelian gauge theory with spontaneously broken symmetry containing a scalar - fermion coupling which is non - linear in the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> although in the unitary gauge it reduces to a pure yukawa term , suggesting that the theory is renormalizable , the one loop divergence structure in this gauge in the fermion - fermion elastic scattering amplitude shows this is not so . </S>",
    "<S> comparison is made with the theory with a conventional coupling , for which cancellation of the non - renormalizable divergences occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> some years ago it was proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a class of pure left su(n)@xmath0u(1 ) gauge theories with spontaneously broken symmetry , capable of accommodating the weinberg - salam model and some of its generalizations up to the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> they exhibit the unfamiliar feature of using a scalar - fermion coupling @xmath1-@xmath2 in the higgs fields , specially designed , however , to reduce to a yukawa term in the unitary gauge . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to ask whether such a construction is generally compatible with renormalizability . </S>",
    "<S> we show here , by pointing to a simple abelian model , that renormalizability can be lost .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the u(1 ) theory given by the lagrangian @xmath3 , with the first term corresponding to the goldstone model @xmath4 _ </S>",
    "<S> 1&=&-(_a_-_a_)^2 + ( d_)^+(d^ ) + ^+-(^+)^2,[l1 ] and _ </S>",
    "<S> 2&=&i|^d_-g|,d_=_-ig a_,g>0 , where the @xmath5 field is defined by writing = e^i , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 real . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion - higgs coupling is of the type mentioned above : it is not linear in @xmath7 , while in the unitary gauge @xmath8 it reduces to a genuine yukawa term .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - linearity associated with @xmath7 makes unitary gauge a most convenient choice for writing the feynman rules . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath9 , @xmath10 denote the masses ( in the tree approximation ) acquired by the fermion and vectorial field after symmetry breaking , and let @xmath11 represent the shifted @xmath5 field with zero vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> then the interaction lagrangian is _ </S>",
    "<S> int= -g|^a_+gm a^a_+g^2 ^2 a^a _ + - g|+ g^3+g^2 ^ 4 , [ lint ] and the feynman rules can be read off from the effective interaction hamiltonian @xcite _ </S>",
    "<S> eff =- l_int+i^4(0)(1+g ) , [ heff ] using the covariant vector field propagator @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , it is generally accepted @xcite that despite the bad ultraviolet behaviour of the massive vectorial propagators in unitary gauge , renormalizability should still allow the @xmath13 matrix divergences to be absorbed into a proper set of counterterms ( which is not the case for arbitrary green functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> when calculating physical quantities , the hidden gauge symmetry is expected to lead in to the cancellation of the non - renormalizable divergences in individual graphs . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out this fails to happen for our theory .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the @xmath14 contribution to the fermion - fermion elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding feynman graphs are displayed in the figure . we have not shown ( i ) diagrams which differ only by an external line permutation , ( ii ) tadpole and external line self - energy diagrams ( as taken care by mass and wave function renormalization ) , and ( iii ) diagrams involving only @xmath15 interactions . the last ones can be easily seen to contain only renormalizable divergences .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of a straightforward calculation can be summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the following pairs of diagrams are finite , though each diagram is separately divergent : ( a , b ) , ( c , d ) , ( e , f ) , ( g , h ) , ( i , j ) . diagrams ( k ) , ( l ) prove to be individually finite . </S>",
    "<S> vertex diagrams ( m ) , ( n ) are logarithmically , while ( o ) , ( p ) , ( q ) and ( r ) quadratically divergent . </S>",
    "<S> the divergences turn out to be momentum - independent , so that in principle they can be cured by coupling constant ( eventually @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> quadratical divergences in diagrams ( s ) , ( t ) correspond to vector field mass and wave function renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> one is left with the quartically divergent self - energy graph ( u ) . </S>",
    "<S> its contribution reads f=2g^4m_f^2    ( k)= . </S>",
    "<S> [ sig ] evaluating the integral in @xmath16 dimensions @xcite one gets for the divergent part _ ( k)= + , which leads , along with mass and wave function renormalization terms , to the non - renormalizable four - fermion interaction f^nr_= ( ) ^2     it is interesting to consider the same process in the theory modified to allow a conventional coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to see that the only way to do this without changing the particle spectrum ( or destroying relativistic invariance ) is to resort to the familiar choice with chiral components of @xmath17 behaving differently under gauge transformations . </S>",
    "<S> one can set , without loss of generality , _ </S>",
    "<S> le^-ig_l , _ </S>",
    "<S> r_r , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the left and right handed projections , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this does not affect @xmath20 , but maintaining u(1 ) gauge invariance requests replacing @xmath21 with _ 2^=i|^(_-iga _ ) </S>",
    "<S> -g((|_l ) _ r+|_r ( ^+_l ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ l2prime ]    the resulting @xmath22 theory is just the appelquist and quinn model </S>",
    "<S> @xcite used in the early days of electroweak theory to test divergence cancellations in unitary gauge calculations . in this gauge </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath13 matrix still follows from the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) with the sole modification in @xmath23 concerning the spinor - vector coupling |^a _ |^a_. [ ai nt ] this proves essential for divergence cancellations . </S>",
    "<S> situation now presents as follows ( the contributing feynamn graphs in both theories are obviously the same ) . </S>",
    "<S> diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) summed yield a logarithmic divergence which equals @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> . diagrams ( k ) and ( l ) produce logarithmic and quadratically divergences which added yield , for each diagram , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these four diagrams thus exactly cancel the divergence in diagram ( u ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of diagrams prove to contain either renormalizable infinities , or non - renormalizable ones corresponding to a pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar four - fermion interaction , which again cancel among themselves    in conclusion , our example shows one should be cautious in extending the renormalizability result @xcite concerning ssb gauge theories when including in the fermion - scalar terms non - linearities in the higgs sector , even though by formal power counting this might look justified . </S>"
