    "comprehensive discussions of theoretical and experimental studies on the activity coefficient of single ions in electrolyte solutions have been recently given by fraenkel @xcite , valik and boda @xcite , and rowland et al .",
    "@xcite , where more references can also be found .",
    "the poisson - fermi ( pf ) model proposed in this paper belongs to the continuum approach that traces back to the simple , elegant , but very coarse theory  the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory . as mentioned by fraenkel",
    ", the continuum theory has evolved in the past century into a series of modified poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equations that can involve an overwhelmingly large number of parameters in order to fit monte carlo ( mc ) , molecular dynamics ( md ) , or experimental data .",
    "many expressions of those parameters are rather long and tedious and do not have clear physical meaning @xcite .    the debye - hckel model is derived from a linearized pb equation @xcite . extended from the dh model ,",
    "the pitzer model @xcite is the most eminent approach to modeling the thermodynamic properties of multicomponent electrolyte solutions due to its unmatched precision over wide ranges of temperature and pressure @xcite .",
    "however , the combinatorial explosion of adjustable parameters in the extended dh modeling functions ( including pitzer ) can cause profound difficulties in fitting experimental data and independent verification because the parameters are very sensitive to numerous related thermodynamic properties in multicomponent systems @xcite .",
    "the poisson - fermi model proposed here involves only one adjustable parameter .",
    "the ineffectiveness of previous poisson - boltzmann models is mainly due to inaccurate treatments of the steric and correlation effects of ions and water molecules whose nonuniform charges and sizes can have significant impact on the activities of all particles in an electrolyte system .",
    "unfortunately , the point charge particles of pb theories have electric fields that are most approximate where they are largest , near the point .",
    "pb theories are not an appealing choice for the leading terms in a series of approximations , for that reason .",
    "the pf theory developed in our papers @xcite demonstrates how these two effects can be described by a simple steric potential and a correlation length of ions .",
    "the parameters of the pf theory describe distinct physical properties of the system in a clear way @xcite .",
    "the gibbs - fermi free energy of the pf model reduces to the classical gibbs free energy of the pb model when the steric potential and correlation length are omitted @xcite .",
    "the pf model has been verified with either mc , md or double layer data at ( more or less ) equilibrium @xcite , and nonequilibrium data from calcium and gramicidin channels @xcite .    here",
    ", we apply the pf theory to study the activity properties of individual ions in strong electrolytes .",
    "the steric effect of all particles and the interstitial voids that accompany them are described by a fermi - like distribution that defines the water densities in the hydration shell of a solvated ion and the particle concentrations in the solvent region outside the hydration shell .",
    "the resulting correlations produce a dielectric function that shows variations in permittivity around the solvated ion . the experimental concentration - dependent dielectric constant model proposed in @xcite",
    "is used to define the concentration - dependent born radii of the solvated ion in the present work .",
    "the experimental data of the activity coefficients of nacl and cacl@xmath0 electrolytes reported in @xcite are used to test the pf model .",
    "the activity coefficient @xmath1 of an ion of species @xmath2 in electrolyte solutions describes the deviation of the chemical potential of the ion from ideality ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the excess chemical potential is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 is an absolute temperature . in poisson - boltzmann theory ,",
    "the excess chemical potential can be calculated by @xcite@xmath7 where the center of the hydrated ion ( also denoted by @xmath2 ) is set to the origin @xmath8 for convenience in the following discussion and @xmath9 is the ionic charge .",
    "the potential function @xmath10 of spatial variable @xmath11 is found by solving the poisson - boltzmann equation@xmath12 where the concentration function @xmath13 is described by a boltzmann distribution ( 3 ) with a constant bulk concentration @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the dielectric constant of bulk water , and @xmath17 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "the potential @xmath18 of the ideal system is obtained by setting @xmath19 in ( 2 ) , i.e. , all ions of @xmath20 species in the system do not electrostatically interact with each other since @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "we consider a large domain @xmath23 of the system in which @xmath24 on the boundary of the domain @xmath25 .",
    "the ideal potential @xmath18 is then a constant , i.e. , @xmath26 is a constant reference chemical potential independent of @xmath14 .    for an equivalent binary system ,",
    "the debye - hckel theory simplifies the calculation by analytically solving a linearized equation of ( 2 ) so that the potential function @xmath10 becomes a constant @xcite@xmath27 dependent of the bulk concentration @xmath14 , where @xmath28 is the avogadro constant .    the poisson - fermi equation proposed in @xcite is@xmath29@xmath30 where @xmath31 is called the steric potential ,",
    "@xmath32 is a void fraction function , @xmath33 is a constant void fraction , and @xmath34 is the volume of a species @xmath22 particle ( hard sphere ) .",
    "note that the pf equation includes water as the last species of particles with the zero charge @xmath35 .",
    "the polarization of the water and solution is an output of the theory .",
    "the water can be described more realistically , for example , as a quadrupole in later versions of the theory .",
    "the distribution ( 6 ) is of fermi type since all concentration functions are bounded above , i.e. , @xmath36 for all particle species with any arbitrary ( or even infinite ) potential @xmath37 at any location @xmath11 in the domain @xmath23 @xcite . the boltzmann distribution ( 3 ) would however diverge if @xmath37 tends to infinity .",
    "this is a major deficiency of pb theory for modeling a system with strong local electric fields or interactions .",
    "the pf equation ( 5 ) and the fermi distribution reduce to the pb equation ( 2 ) and the boltzmann distribution ( 3 ) , respectively , when @xmath38 , i.e. , when the correlation and steric effects are not considered .",
    "if the correlation length @xmath39 , the dielectric operator @xmath40 approximates the permittivity of the bulk solvent and the linear response of correlated ions @xcite , where @xmath41 is the radius of the ion . the dielectric function @xmath42 is a further approximation of @xmath43 .",
    "it is found by transforming ( 5 ) into two second - order pdes @xcite@xmath44 by introducing a density like variable @xmath45 that yields a polarization charge density @xmath46 of water using maxwell s first equation @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions of the new variable @xmath45 on the boundary @xmath25 were derived from the global charge neutrality condition @xcite .    to obtain more accurate potentials at the origin @xmath8 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath47 , we need to consider the size and hydration shell of the hydrated ion @xmath2 .",

    "the evaluation of the green function @xmath82 on @xmath77 always yields finite numbers and thus avoids the singularity .",
    "note that our model can be applied to electrolyte solutions at any temperature @xmath6 having any arbitrary number ( @xmath20 ) of ionic species with different size spheres and valences .",
    "numerical values of model notations are given in table 1 , where the occupancy number @xmath83 is taken to be the experimental coordination number of the calcium ion ca@xmath84 given in @xcite for all ions @xmath85 na@xmath86 , ca@xmath84 , and cl@xmath87 since the electric potential produced by the solvated ion diminishes exponentially in the outer shell region in which a small variation of @xmath73 for @xmath85 na@xmath86 and cl@xmath87 does not affect numerical approximations too much .",
    "obviously the coordination number may be different for different types of ions and at different concentrations and so on .",
    "we were surprised that we can fit experimental data so well using a single experimentally determined occupancy number for all ions and conditions .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the solvation free energy of an ion @xmath2 should vary with salt concentrations and can be expressed by a dielectric constant @xmath88 that depends on the bulk concentration of the ion @xmath89 .",
