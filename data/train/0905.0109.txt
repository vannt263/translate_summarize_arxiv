    "<S> we describe the design , fabrication , and spectroscopy of coupled , high quality ( @xmath0 ) factor silicon nanobeam photonic crystal cavities . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the single nanobeam cavity modes are coupled into even and odd superposition modes , and we simulate the frequency and @xmath0 factor as a function of nanobeam spacing , demonstrating that a differential wavelength shift of 70 nm between the two modes is possible while maintaining @xmath0 factors greater than @xmath1 . for </S>",
    "<S> both on - substrate and free - standing nanobeams , we experimentally monitor the response of the even mode as the gap is varied , and measure @xmath0 factors as high as @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> photonic crystal cavities have been of great interest in recent years for their ability to strongly confine light in wavelength - scale volumes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality ( @xmath0 ) factors and small mode volumes of these structures have enabled a wealth of new applications in areas as diverse as low - threshold lasers  @xcite , optical switching  @xcite , low power nonlinear optics  @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics  @xcite , and chemical sensing  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> single photonic crystal ( phc ) cavities have now been optimized to a point where they can be treated as fundamental photonic components . to realize new functionality , it is essential to leverage the natural scalability of phc cavities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , phc cavities can be integrated into coupled resonator optical waveguides ( crows )  @xcite to realize novel heterostructures capable of slowing light  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also much recent excitement about the possibility of entangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom of a double cavity device@xcite . to achieve optomechanical coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the cavities require a small mass and a flexible platform . </S>",
    "<S> these two properties are inherent to photonic crystal nanobeam cavities , which have been the subject of much recent investigation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to optomechanical effects , double cavity structures could facilitate adiabatic wavelength conversion . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that the spacing of double planar phc cavities can be varied to realize broad bandwidth dynamic resonance tuning while maintaining the high @xmath0 factor of the cavity mode  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we show the static tuning of double cavity modes by varying the cavity separation , thereby demonstrating a proof - of - principle of this effect .    in this work , we study coupled photonic crystal nanobeam cavities consisting of two parallel suspended beams separated by a small gap , each patterned with a 1d line of holes , as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fab](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point for our double nanobeam design is our previously reported single phc nanobeam cavity  @xcite . to briefly summarize the approach , we start with a 220 nm thick and 500 nm wide free - standing si waveguide ( nanobeam ) which supports only a single transverse electric mode . </S>",
    "<S> the nanobeam is patterned with a linear array of air holes to introduce a stop - band in the guided mode bandstructure around 1550 nm . </S>",
    "<S> near the middle of the beam , the hole size and spacing are tapered to introduce a defect potential capable of strongly localizing light . </S>",
    "<S> optimization of the adiabatic 5-hole taper design leads to simulated @xmath0-factors greater than @xmath3 , and we have experimentally measured @xmath4 in these single beam structures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then created double cavity structures by positioning two such cavities side - by - side and varying the air gap between them . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from the physics of coupled harmonic oscillators , coupling generates new modes which are symmetric and anti - symmetric superpositions of the single cavity basis states , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sim ]  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy splitting between the modes is dependent on the strength of the coupling , which in this case is determined by the size of the gap .     </S>",
    "<S> nm , and cavity length , @xmath5 nm . ( c ) mode wavelength and quality factor for different nanobeam separations . the resonant scattering spectrum for the 150 nm double cavity is shown in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fab],width=321 ]    the mode profiles , @xmath0 factors , and resonant wavelengths are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sim ] as a function of the gap , @xmath6 , between the nanobeams . </S>",
    "<S> the data were simulated with a 3d finite - difference time - domain code ( lumerical solutions ) . </S>",
    "<S> for small @xmath6 , the coupling between the cavities is large , leading to a large splitting of the two modes . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength of the odd mode changes little with @xmath6 , whereas the even mode disperses rapidly to longer wavelength as @xmath6 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be understood from the mode profiles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sim](a ) , which show that the even mode has an anti - node in the gap , whereas the odd mode has a node in the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the significant renormalization of the even mode renders it highly sensitive to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath6 shrinks below 100 nm , the field intensity of the gap anti - node grows and becomes the dominant feature in the mode , much like an air - slot cavity  @xcite . at the same time , the @xmath0 factor declines , since the photonic crystal tapering is not optimized for the significant redistribution of the mode energy into the slot between the nanobeams . </S>",
    "<S> these factors imply that the even mode would be a sensitive probe of the inter - beam distance , and thus useful for optomechanical applications  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it would also be useful in bio- and chemical - sensing , as the gap anti - node would be highly sensitive to perturbations in the external environment . as we will show below , </S>",
    "<S> it is only this mode which can be probed experimentally in our resonant scattering setup  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> factors of even and odd coupled nanobeam modes . </S>",
    "<S> insets show @xmath7 components of the modes . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) mode wavelengths as a function of separation , showing large dispersion of even mode . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sim],width=321 ]    in contrast to the significant alterations of the even mode , the odd mode is similar in profile to a superposition of two _ uncoupled _ single cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> because of the node in the gap , the cavities do not significantly perturb each other , and this results in a relatively small dispersion with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 factor , however , is substantially higher than that of the even mode , and in fact is approximately twice the @xmath0 factor of a single nanobeam cavity ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , this is consistent with the larger mode volume , @xmath9(@xmath10)@xmath11 , which is about twice that of the single cavity ; the more extended real - space distribution of the fields results in a more localized @xmath12-space distribution , and therefore a reduction in the radiative components within the light cone  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the double nanobeam structures shown in fig .  [ fig : fab ] were fabricated on a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) wafer ( soitec inc ) consisting of a silicon device layer of 220 nm , a sio@xmath13 layer of 2@xmath14 m , and a thick silicon substrate . a negative e - beam resist , foxx-17 ( dow corning ) diluted in six parts of methyl isobutyl ketone , </S>",
    "<S> was spun onto the sample at 5000 rpm to give a layer 135 nm thick , and patterns were defined using a 100 kv electron beam lithography system ( elionix ) . </S>",
    "<S> a negative resist simplifies the pattern - writing , since the only exposed region is along the nanobeam , and foxx proved to be a robust etch mask for the rie process . </S>",
    "<S> the resist was developed for 14 s in tetra - methyl ammonium hydroxide ( @xmath15% tmah ) followed by a thorough rinse in de - ionized water . </S>",
    "<S> the patterns were transfered to the silicon layer using reactive ion etching with a sf@xmath16 , c@xmath17f@xmath18 and h@xmath13 plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the sio@xmath13 sacrificial layer was removed using a hydrofluoric acid vapor etching tool ( ammt )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally probed our double nanobeam cavities using a cross - polarized resonant scattering technique  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a tunable cw laser ( agilent ) was focused onto the cavity from normal incidence with a microscope objective ( numerical aperture = 0.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonantly scattered reflected signal was analyzed in the cross polarization before being sent to an ingaas detector . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we used the same approach to measure @xmath0 factors as high as @xmath19 in single nanobeam cavities  @xcite . because the resonant excitation field drives the ( @xmath7 ) fields in the coupled nanobeams _ in phase _ , this technique is primarily sensitive to the even mode . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in principle , the field gradient of the focussed spot could be exploited to excite the odd mode , as could butt - coupling or evanescent waveguide coupling techniques  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fab](c ) shows the resonant wavelength and @xmath0 factor of the even mode for three different nanobeam separations . as predicted by our simulations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sim ] ) , the mode red - shifts as @xmath6 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 factor varies between @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> although this is more than an order of magnitude lower than predicted by simulations , this is a highly useful range for applications , and we expect increases as the fabrication quality of our structures improves .    </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the effect of the substrate on the cavity modes . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , for small @xmath6 , the even mode field intensity is concentrated in the space between the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> this slot mode could be useful for bio- and chemical sensing , but to be robust in a liquid environment such a device would require the structural stability provided by a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> due to the limited tuning range of our laser , these data were obtained from cavities with a size ( @xmath21 ) of 136 nm , which is smaller than our optimal design of 146 nm ( data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fab](c ) ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : subrel](a ) and ( b ) , we present the results of our resonant scattering spectroscopy for unreleased , on - substrate nanobeam cavities ( i.e. supported by sio@xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the foxx resist was not removed for these cavities , since any etch process would also remove the substrate . however , we estimate that the resist layer remaining on top of the silicon nanobeams has a thickness less than 40 nm . the resonant wavelength and @xmath0 factor of the even mode </S>",
    "<S> are plotted as a function of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance blue - shifts with increasing @xmath6 as the effective index of the cavity mode decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment shows a larger dispersion than the simulation , likely reflecting the increasing role of e - beam lithography proximity effects for small gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath0 factors of @xmath22 are remarkably high for supported cavities  @xcite , considering that the designs were optimized for free - standing nanobeams . given the robust structure , high @xmath0 factors , and field intensity in the gap , the supported double nanobeam cavity is a promising approach to scalable , on - chip sensing applications .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : subrel](c ) and ( d ) show the experimental data for the same cavities after the sacrifical sio@xmath13 substrate was removed . the modes are blue - shifted compared to the results of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : subrel](a ) , as expected from the decreased effective index of the air cladding compared to the oxide . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 factors , however , are increased by a factor of @xmath23 due to the reduced leakage into the substrate .    in conclusion , by varying the spacing of two coupled nanobeam cavities , we have achieved resonance tuning over a 20 nm range for both on - substrate and free - standing structures while maintaining a relatively constant @xmath0 factor . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the same tuning principle that was predicted recently for double planar photonic crystal cavities  @xcite , and the effect would be magnified for coupled nanobeams with smaller separations . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to tune the resonant wavelength of a cavity without adverse effects on the @xmath0 factor opens up new potential areas for research in optomechanics , adiabatic frequency conversion , and sensing . </S>"
