    "the ability to focus light through highly scattering translucent or opaque random media has been a long - standing challenge .",
    "strong scattering impedes information transfer through random media and is a limiting factor in many optical imaging and characterization systems .",
    "strong scattering does not necessarily equate to information loss , however .",
    "for example , the presence of speckle patterns in the fields scattered from static translucent media illuminated by monochromatic waves implies the retention of information despite strong scattering .",
    "this realization opens up the possibility of focusing light through highly scattering media by wavefront shaping .",
    "vellekoop and colleagues @xcite were the first to show that by shaping incident wavefronts with a spatial light modulator ( slm ) one can compensate for scattering phenomena to produce light focused onto a point inside or beyond the scattering medium @xcite . their technique and variants thereof have been used to focus light through white paint layers , eggshells , clouds , dense fogs @xcite , and biological tissue @xcite . the ability to focus light at a desired location within or beyond highly scattering media",
    "has potential applications ranging from biomedical engineering @xcite and microscopy to endoscopy @xcite ( and references therein ) , optical trapping @xcite , super resolution imaging @xcite , and nano - positioning @xcite .    their enormous potential notwithstanding",
    ", widespread use of the above and related schemes in real - world applications has somewhat lagged expectations .",
    "needless to say , adoption of any wavefront shaping method to focus light through highly scattering media hinges on the practicality of the scheme for determining the optimal wavefront .",
    "methods developed to date by and large belong to one of two categories .",
    "+ ( i ) iterative methods that use measurements of transmitted field magnitudes ( square roots of field intensities ) . the majority of wavefront shaping methods developed to date use measurements of transmitted field magnitudes to progressively improve field focus by sequentially changing the phase retardation imposed on each pixel of the input beam using an slm .",
    "these methods maximize intensity of the output field at a defined location by changing one slm pixel at a time @xcite . while very powerful , these methods tend to be slow and prone to convergence to a local optimum",
    ". they also must be repeated every time a new target output intensity profile is specified .",
    "+ ( ii ) non - iterative methods that use measurements of transmitted field magnitudes and phases .",
    "knowledge of the transmission matrix ( tm ) of the medium allows for the optimal wavefront to be computed non - iteratively for any desired output .",
    "if the desired output is a focal spot , then only a portion ( e.g. a row or set of rows ) or the tm are required .",
    "the first measurement of an optical tm was undertaken by popoff et al .",
    "@xcite . using a common - path interferometer equipped with an slm , the tm of an opaque layer of zno nanoparticles was measured and then used to generate optical foci in the output plane .",
    "this method was also used to demonstrate image transmission through the opaque layer @xcite .",
    "most approaches developed to date to measure tms rely on holographic methods .",
    "needless to say , methods for determining tms that do not require a reference beam would be tremendously useful in this context .",
    "a first step in this direction recently was taken by drmeau et al @xcite , who used a phase retrieval algorithm to measure the complex tm of a highly scattering medium using a digital micro - mirror .",
    "this work introduces a new waveform - shaping technique for producing focused fields that uses semidefinite programming ( sdp ) to construct portions of the medium s tm from intensity measurements only ; once the relevant parts of the tm are calculated the method proceeds like any of the above non - iterative schemes .",
    "the sdp approach leverages a rigorous yet flexible computational framework that utilizes the algorithm developed by waldspurger et al @xcite to retrieve the phase of elements of the tm after recording intensities in the desired focal spot produced by several randomly structured illuminations of the scattering medium .",
    "we note that sdp has been successfully applied to many problems in other fields , ranging from x - ray and crystallography imaging and diffraction imaging to fourier optics and microscopy @xcite .",
    "we believe this work to be the first to apply this powerful algorithm to problems related to optical phase retrieval enabled wavefront control .",
    "we demonstrate that sdp allows the construction of the incident wavefronts that generate intense foci anywhere beyond the medium from a single set of measurements of intensities generated by random illuminations .",
    "we furthermore show that the algorithm yields a greater enhancement through the same set of measurements than the stepwise sequential ( sws ) method proposed by vellekoop @xcite .",
    "the setup under consideration is shown in fig .",

    "light in the input aperture impinging on the random medium therefore is characterized by @xmath3 complex - valued electric field samples @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the experimental setup used , we can control both the amplitude and phase of @xmath4 , or as in more common , only its phase .",
    "likewise , light in the output aperture exiting the random medium is characterized by @xmath3 complex - valued electric field samples @xmath6 with @xmath5 .",
    "our experimental setup only allows for measurements of the magnitude of each @xmath6 .",
    "note : for expositional simplicity we assume that the number of pixels in the input and output apertures are equal . in an experimental setup , they often are different with the number of pixels in @xmath1 exceeding those in @xmath0 .",
    "the arguments below however are easily generalized to this setting .",
    "likewise , we characterize electric fields in @xmath0 and @xmath1 by scalars . again , the arguments below are easily modified to account for the vector nature of the fields .",
