    "neutron stars are stellar objects produced as a result of supernova explosions .",
    "they are highly condensed since their masses are of the order of one to two times the solar mass , but their radii are only 10 to 12 km . when a neutron star is born its temperature is of the order of @xmath0 k but in a few days it cools down to about @xmath1 k by emitting neutrinos .",
    "the temperature at the surface is about one - tenth that of the interior temperature and it was found that it radiates x - rays .",
    "neutron stars are normally treated as zero temperature stellar objects because their temperatures , although high , are still very low as compared with their characteristic energies of excitation .",
    "unfortunately the x - ray emissions are still not well understood to give a clear picture of the possible interior of the neutron stars .",
    "their outer crust is believed to be formed mainly by nuclei and electrons and , as density increases free neutrons are also expected to appear .",
    "the inner core of the neutron stars however are still a source of expeculation , some of the possibilities being the appearance of hyperons , of a mixed phase of hyperons and quarks , only quarks or pion and kaon condensates .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) and the internal constitution of the neutron stars depend on the nature of the strong interaction .",
    "one possibility is the existence of matter with strangeness to baryon ratio , @xmath2 , of order unity . in a compact stars strangeness",
    "may occur in the form of fermions such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 hyperons , as a bose condensate i.e. @xmath5 meson condensate or in the form of strange quarks in the mixed phase of hadrons and quarks or in a pure quark phase . in the hadron phase",
    ", hyperons influence the neutron star structure @xcite .",
    "keplon and nelson @xcite have suggested that , above some critical density , the ground state of baryonic matter might contain a bose - einstein condensate of negatively charged kaons .",
    "there is a strong attraction between @xmath5 mesons and baryons which increases with density and lowers the energy of the zero momentum state .",
    "a condensate is formed when this energy equals the kaon chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "hence , in neutron stars charge neutrality favors kaon condensation because the neutrons at the top of the fermi sea decay into protons plus electrons , which in turn , have an increase in the energy as the density increases .",
    "when the electron chemical potential equals the effective kaon mass , the kaons are favored in helping with the conservation of charge neutrality because they are bosons and can condense in the lowest energy state .",
    "for this reason @xmath5 mesons are the ones normally included in the calculations since their charge is the same as the electric charge .    many calculations for eoss in dense matter show that the hyperons appear at densities above @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the equilibrium nuclear matter density .",
    "typically , the critical density for condensation is @xmath9 in nucleon matter ( although it is model and parameter dependent ) . a density of this order is smaller than the central density of the neutron star , so a @xmath5 condensate could be present in its core .",
    "the possibility of kaon condensation in the dense interior of neutron stars was investigated with the help of a chiral @xcite and the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) @xcite for the description of the hadronic phase @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the baryonic octet was also included . in @xcite results obtained within the zimani and moskowski ( zm ) model @xcite at zero and finite temperature ,",
    "have also been discussed .    in previous works ,",
    "we have extensively discussed many possible eos used to describe hybrid stars either after the deleptonization era @xcite or before it has taken place , when neutrinos are still trapped inside the star @xcite .",
    "the hybrid stars are constituted of a hadronic phase , present in the outer and crust parts of the star , a mixed phase of hadrons and quarks and possibly a central part composed of quarks only . in the afore mentioned works we have always followed a gibbs prescription in the construction of the mixed phase .",
    "the implementation of gibbs criteria for phase coexistence requires a global charge neutrality condition and results in a smooth eos where no discontinuities are present .",
    "both independent neutron and electron chemical potentials are enforced to be identical in both hadron and quark phases at the phase transition point .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the phase transition from a hadronic phase to a phase with baryons and kaon condensate using the quark - meson - coupling model ( qmc ) @xcite including hyperons in order to describe the hadron phase . in the qmc model ,",
    "baryons are described as a system of non - overlapping mit bags which interact through the effective scalar and vector mean fields , very much in the same way as in the walecka model .",
    "nevertheless , the quark degrees of freedom are explicitly taken into account and the coupling constants are defined at the quark level , what makes the qmc a richer model mainly when the properties of mesons in nuclear medium are investigated . here",
    "we treat the kaons as mit bags and the couplings of kaons to mesons are determined from the formalism .    in @xcite",
    "the in - medium kaon and anti - kaon properties were studied within the qmc framework .",
    "next we use their prescription to find the kaon properties namely , the bag radius in medium , the effective mass of the baryons , the coupling of kaons with hyperons .",
    "in the qmc model , the nucleon in nuclear medium is assumed to be a static spherical mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar and vector fields , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and these fields are treated as classical fields in the mean field approximation .",
    "the quark field , @xmath13 , inside the bag then satisfies the equation of motion : @xmath14 \\,\\psi_q(x)=0\\ , \\quad   q = u , d , s , \\label{eq - motion}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the classical meson fields for sigma , omega and rho mesons .",
    "@xmath18 is the current quark mass , @xmath19 is the third component of the pauli matrices and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the quark couplings with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons . the normalized ground state ( @xmath23- state ) for a quark in the bag",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the bag radius of the baryon , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the quark spinor and @xmath31 is the normalization constant .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 all depend on the baryon considered .",
    "the boundary condition at the bag surface is given by @xmath33 which reduces to @xmath34 for the ground state and determines the dimensionless quark momentum @xmath35 .",
    "the energy of a static bag describing baryon @xmath29 , consisting of three ground state quarks , can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a parameter which accounts for zero - point motion and @xmath38 is the bag constant .",
    "the set of parameters used in the present work is given in @xcite for the bag value @xmath39 mev , @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 mev .",
    "the effective mass of a nucleon bag at rest is taken to be @xmath42 as in @xcite , we assume that the kaons are described by the static mit bag , in the same way as the nucleon and the hyperons",
    ". moreover , the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons are only mediators of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 quarks inside the kaons .",
    "similarly the effective mass for the kaon is given by @xmath45 for our calculation , we have fixed the bag constant , @xmath46 , same as for the nucleon and from the kaon mass and the stability condition at vacuum , we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 fm for @xmath49 fm . the equilibrium condition for the bag",
    "is obtained by minimizing the effective masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 with respect to the bag radius @xmath52 and @xmath53    for the qmc model with kaons , the equations of motion for the meson fields in uniform static matter are given by @xmath54^{1/2 } } \\ : k^2 \\ dk + g_{\\sigma k}~ \\rho_k , \\label{field1}\\ ] ] @xmath55 @xmath56 in the above equations @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the spin , isospin projection and the fermi momentum of the baryon species @xmath29 and @xmath60 is the kaon density . in eq .",
    "( [ field1 ] ) we have @xmath61 where @xmath62    after self - consistent calculation , the kaon effective mass , @xmath51 can be parametrized as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 for @xmath49 fm .    boosting the @xmath65 bags we get the dispersion relation for the kaons @xmath66    the above prescription is equivalent to using , for the kaon sector , the effective lagrangian density @xcite @xmath67 with @xmath68 and the effective kaon mass defined by ( [ mks ] ) .",
    "we have used @xcite @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we have taken the standard values for the meson masses , @xmath75 mev , @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 mev .",
    "the hyperon couplings are not relevant to the ground state properties of nuclear matter , but information about them can be available from the levels in @xmath3 hypernuclei @xcite . in this work",
    "we have used @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are equal to @xmath82 for the nucleons and equal to @xmath83 for the other baryons @xcite . note that the @xmath23-quark is unaffected by the sigma , omega and rho mesons i.e. @xmath84 the kaon couplings are given by @xmath85 , @xmath86    the total energy density and the pressure including the leptons and the kaons can be obtained from the grand canonical potential . the kaons",
    "do not contribute directly to the pressure as they are in a @xmath23-wave boson condensate , but do contribute to the energy density .",
    "the leptons are included as a free fermi gas since they only interact with the baryons via the weak interaction .",
    "we then obtain :    @xmath87^{1/2 } + \\sum_l \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 } \\int_0^{k_l } k^2   dk\\left[k^2 + m_l^2\\right]^{1/2 } + \\varepsilon_k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath88 @xmath89^{1/2 } } + \\frac{1}{3 } \\sum_l \\frac{1}{\\pi^2 } \\int_0^{k_l } \\frac{k^4   dk } { \\left[k^2 + m_l^2\\right]^{1/2 } } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lepton fermi momenta are the positive real solutions of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the equilibrium composition of the star is obtained by solving the set of eqs .",
    "( [ field1])- ( [ field3 ] ) in conjunction with the charge neutrality condition ( [ neutral ] ) at a given total baryonic density @xmath92 ; the baryon and kaon effective masses are obtained self - consistently in the bag model .",
    "the charge neutrality condition yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 corresponds to the electric charge of baryon species @xmath29 and @xmath95 corresponds to the electric charge of lepton species @xmath96 . since the time scale of a star is effectively infinite compared to the weak interaction time scale , weak interaction violates strangeness conservation .",
    "the strangeness quantum number is therefore not conserved in a star and the net strangeness is determined by the condition of @xmath97-equilibrium which for baryon @xmath29 is then given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the chemical potential of baryon @xmath29 and @xmath100 its baryon number .",
    "thus the chemical potential of any baryon can be obtained from the two independent chemical potentials @xmath101 and @xmath102 of neutron and electron respectively .",
    "we have always used the parameter set mentioned in the previous section . the parameter set proposed in @xcite was not used since the program fails to converge at high densities for larger bag radius .",
    "as the kaons are only present within these range of densities , we have opted to use a parametrization with a smaller bag radius . in what follows",
    "we look at the neutron star properties that has a phase transition from a hadron phase described with the qmc model to a phase with hadrons and a kaon condensate .    in figure",
    "[ eos]a , we show the eoss obtained in qmc model for the nucleons and nucleons plus kaon phase .",
    "a kaon condensation is possible for densities greater than @xmath103 , where @xmath8 is the saturation density .",
    "if hyperons are included , fig .",
    "[ eos]b case , kaon condensation appears at even higher densities . in order to compare the results obtained with the qmc model with the ones obtained with the nlwm",
    ", we also plot the eos for the nlwm in figures [ eos]a and [ eos]b . if no hyperons are present ( fig .",
    "[ eos]a ) , at densities which allow kaon condensation , both models practically coincide , although the eos for the nlwm with nucleons only presents a harder eos than the qmc model .",
    "including hyperons makes the nlwm eos softer than the qmc one .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of strangeness in a harder eos , like the nlwm eos , has much larger effects . at this point",
    "it is worth emphasing that in @xcite all eos and star properties depend on the choice of the potential which fixes the scalar coupling constant in the nlwm , which is not the case in the present work within the qmc model since this coupling is density dependent and an outcome of the calculation depending on the bag properties . in figure",
    "[ coup ] we plot the density dependence of the kaon - sigma coupling for symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath97-equilibrium nuclear matter and @xmath97-equilibrium hadronic matter with hyperons .",
    "the last curve lies below the @xmath97-equilibrium nuclear matter , closer to the symmetric nuclear matter result , because including hyperons increases the proton fraction . for the nlwm we have @xmath104 . in figure [ effm ]",
    "we show the kaon and nucleon effective masses .",
    "notice that the mass of the nucleons are more affected by the medium than that of the kaons , but both decrease quite a lot at the high densities present in neutron stars .",
    "we define the kaon optical potentials in the present formalism as @xmath105 . with the present choice of parameters for the qmc model ,",
    "the @xmath106 potential is of the order of -22 mev and @xmath5 potential amounts to -123 mev at the saturation density . in table",
    "i we show how these potentials vary with the bag radius at saturation point .",
    "although the @xmath106 potential does not vary much , the @xmath5 potential changes quite drastically with the choice of the bag radius . another point of interest is the fact that , according to @xcite , the @xmath106 feels a weak repulsive potential and the @xmath5 a strong attractive one .",
    "the kaon flow in heavy - ion collisions was shown to be consistent with the predictions of the chiral perturbation theory and the values for the @xmath106 and @xmath5 potentials were calculated around 10 and -100 mev respectively . in order to obtain a value approximately equal to 10 mev for the @xmath106 potential , we could have rescaled the coupling @xmath107 as 1.625 @xmath108 for nucleon bag radius @xmath49 fm and kaon bag radius @xmath48 fm .",
    "the authors of @xcite faced the same problem but they concluded that the rescaling did not alter any of their qualitative result .",
    "also in @xcite they pointed that this shortcoming has its origin in the fact that the bag model does not deal properly with the goldstone nature of the @xmath109-mesons . in fig .",
    "[ disp ] we show that , although both potentials are attractive at the saturation density , the @xmath106 potential becomes repulsive at @xmath110 .",
    "increasing the kaon bag radius would only give rise to a small decrease of the @xmath106 potential , namely for @xmath111 fm we obtain @xmath112 mev at saturation density .",
    "for the nlwm calculations we have chosen the @xmath5 potential as -123 mev and plotted the eos in fig ( [ eos ] ) so that the comparison with the qmc model would be more appropriate .",
    "for the nlwm we have calculated the @xmath106 potential as being around 16 mev at saturation density ."
