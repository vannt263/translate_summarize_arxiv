    "the rayleigh - taylor instability is a fingering instability of an interface between two fluids of different densities .",
    "it takes place when the heavier fluid is decelerated by the lighter fluid or , in other words , density and pressure gradients have opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite occurs in numerous physical and technological situations , e.g. , gravity - driven instability of a heavier fluid atop a lighter one and inertial confinement fusion .",
    "in essence , the rayleigh - taylor instability is the first step in a fluid - mixing mechanism , the step eventually leading via formation of bubbles , spikes , and curtains to the turbulent regime of fluid mixing . along with the kelvin - helmholtz criterion for tangential discontinuities at the interface between two normal fluids ,",
    "the rayleigh - taylor criterion is among the most generic principles in the complicated subject of interface instability .",
    "for the interfaces of superfluid @xmath0he , some of the hydrodynamic instabilities have been found as well .",
    "first , we mention the faraday instability which denotes the phenomenon of the parametric excitation of standing waves on the free surface of a fluid . the flat shape of the surface becomes unstable with a periodic modulation of the acceleration of gravity .",
    "recently @xcite , generation of faraday standing waves on the free surface of @xmath0he has been realized in the experimental cell subjected to sinusoidal vibration in the vertical direction .",
    "according to @xcite , it is also possible to generate a dense fog of helium droplets by driving the capillary waves on a superfluid @xmath0he surface unstable with an intense ultrasonic beam from a piezoelectric transducer under the surface .",
    "there have been observed electrohydrodynamic interface instabilities due to charges trapped at the surfaces and interfaces of various condensed helium phases @xcite . the shear flow between the superfluid _ a _ and _ b _ phases of @xmath1he can result in the kelvin - helmholtz interface instability @xcite .",
    "dynamics of the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface due to sufficiently fast processes of crystallization and melting resembles much that of the free surface of a fluid .",
    "in particular , as was predicted by andreev and parshin , the crystal in contact with its liquid phase can support wave - like processes of crystallization and melting , see review @xcite . from the dynamical point of view such weakly damping crystallization waves are an immediate counterpart of the well - known gravitational - capillary waves at the vapor - liquid interfaces .    a series of mechanical and hydrodynamical instabilities has been predicted and observed for the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface .",
    "we mention the grinfeld instability under uniaxial stress of a solid .",
    "warping of the flat interface occurs at some threshold stress when the release of elastic energy exceeds the loss of the surface energy @xcite . like normal fluids ,",
    "the steady flow of a superfluid in the direction tangential to the interface can result in the kelvin - helmholtz instability . as the flow exceeds a threshold magnitude ,",
    "crystallization waves appear at the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has qualitatively been observed as a distortion of the crystal surface in the fluid jet @xcite .",
    "an analogy with generating sea waves by wind is fully appropriate here .    to date",
    ", the rayleigh - taylor phenomena have extensively been studied in normal fluids , but not much study has been made in superfluids or quantum solids .",
    "the classical rayleigh - taylor instability of the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface in the field of gravity is observed by demaria , lewellen , and dahm @xcite . in these experiments a cell in which the solid and liquid phases occupy initially the lower and upper halves , respectively , is inverted mechanically by 180@xmath2 .",
    "after inversion a single finger of the liquid phase ascends at the centre of a cell , and the solid phase descends along the walls . on the other hand , in experiment @xcite the flat shape of the interface remained stable for a @xmath0he crystal grown at the needle point with its lower facet under favorable condition for developing the gravity - driven instability",
    "a difference in the observations can be associated with the following reasons .",
    "the requirement for the interface instability as well as the initial stage of fingering process , as is shown in @xcite , is sensitive to the state of a crystal facet , rough or smooth , and to the size of a facet .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the faraday instability is also inherent in the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface .",
    "crystallization waves at the horizontal interface between superfluid and solid @xmath0he are generated by a periodic vibration of an experimental cell in the vertical direction .",
    "in accordance with expectation @xcite the amplitude of the waves excited at one - half of the driving frequency decreases for higher temperatures due to reduction of the interface growth coefficient describing dissipative properties of the interface . from general arguments the faraday instability can be viewed as a particular case of the taylor instability for the periodically driven interface .    on the other side ,",
    "the spectrum of crystallization waves remains invariable for the steady flow of a superfluid in the direction normal to the interface @xcite . at first sight",
    "this implies that the growth of a solid should not bring the superfluid - solid interface to instability .",
    "however , in the experiments on free growth of a @xmath0he crystal initiated at the needle point immersed into the overpressurized liquid bulk @xcite one can observe a destruction of the regular shape of the crystal triggered under sufficiently large overpressure exceeding about 6  mbar . immediately after nucleation",
    "the crystal seed has a clear hexagonal prism - like shape with slight ripples . soon afterwards by 0.10.2  ms the shape of the crystal becomes round with a highly irregular outline .",
    "far later by 100150  ms , as the net overpressure vanishes and the pressure in the cell becomes phase - equilibrium , the shape of the grown crystal relaxes to a regular hexagonal prism .",
    "we put two images of a crystal in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "he crystal at 0.47  k and initial overpressure 5.2  mbar .",
    "the left frame corresponds to 0.19  ms after nucleation .",
    "the right frame is taken 80  ms later when the net pressure is already close to the melting pressure .",
    "the vertical size of the frames is 2.4  mm . ]    for overpressures higher than 6  mbar , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we discover more exotic patterns by the same time interval 0.10.2  ms after the voltage pulse which triggers nucleation .",
    "the interfacial irregularities become more pronounced and acquire a mushroom - like shape . apparently , the fluid moves into the crystal between the neighboring spikes , resulting eventually in generation of liquid bubbles inside the crystal .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the behavior of the pressure in the course of the crystal growth .",
    "after nucleation of a crystal seed the overpressure in the cell drops and then gradually vanishes , oscillating around zero value corresponding to the equilibrium pressure .",
    "the pressure oscillations are due , in the first turn , to the finiteness of the experimental volume and the finiteness of sound velocity .",
    "the point is that the appearance of a solid seed and its next growth are accompanied by variations of the density and the volume in which the density changes .",
    "the change of the seed volume results in exciting and emitting the sound waves which propagate in the direction to the container walls with the next backward reflection from the walls to the solid seed .",
    "e.g. , the first- and second - sound emissions with an expanding @xmath1he - concentrated drop in a superfluid @xmath1he-@xmath0he mixture has been analyzed in ref .",
    "the excitation and emission of sound become more and more effective as the interface rate and acceleration increase .",
    "eventually , we obtain acoustic damping oscillations of the liquid inside the cell  @xcite . in some sense",
    "the damping of the pressure oscillations represents a quality factor of a liquid / solid or melting / freezing resonator . in the lack of any dissipative processes in the system",
    "the pressure oscillations will last infinitely long .",
    "the pressure in the cell becomes equilibrium pressure in 2  ms and the driving force vanishes .",
    "finally at 16  ms , the crystal relaxed and acquired the regular hexagonal shape .",
    "however , we still observe the liquid bubbles embedded into the crystal bulk .",
    "if we roughly estimate the velocity which the interface should acquire by the time of the overpressure release and formation of the irregular outline , we will find a rather high magnitude of several meters per second .",
    "the corresponding acceleration which provides such increment of velocity should be about 10@xmath3 , @xmath4 being acceleration of gravity .",
    "on the whole , large acceleration for a short time shows evidence in favor of a shock - driven character of the crystal growth .",
    "it is interesting to note that the irregular patterns observed are similar in appearance to those obtained in studies @xcite of a shock - accelerated boundary between two gases of different densities .",
    "the typical time of the pattern formation was of the same order of several tenths of millisecond .    in the present work",
    "we develop a linear theory on the taylor instability of an arbitrarily accelerated boundary between the superfluid and solid @xmath0he phases .",
    "in essence , we derive an equation which the small interfacial perturbations obey .",
    "we consider three typical cases of the interface acceleration : constant , shock , and periodic .",
    "the plane and spherical interface geometries are analyzed .",
    "let us assume the interface is parallel to the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , with vertical position @xmath7 which moves at the rate @xmath8 .",
    "the upper half - space @xmath9 is occupied with the liquid phase and the solid phase occupies the lower one @xmath10 . below",
    "we will consider the stability of the moving interface with respect to its small perturbations @xmath11 from the flat shape .",
    "thus , the coordinate @xmath12 gives the vertical position of the perturbed interface evolving in time .    to discover the effect of nonuniform motion on the stability of the interfacial shape",
    ", we make a number of simplifying assumptions which do not affect the main point of the phenomenon .",
    "the validity and criteria of applicability for the assumptions to be made below can be found in the papers on the kinetic interface coefficients and crystallization waves  @xcite .",
    "so , in the superfluid we employ the usual two - fluid equations without dissipation . in addition , we assume that the growth rate of a solid @xmath13 is always small compared with the velocity of the first or second sound .",
    "this is an ordinary experimental situation .",
    "thus we treat the hydrodynamics of the superfluid in the approximation of incompressible liquid and the constancy of the entropy density . in this case @xcite the velocities @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the normal and superfluid motions can be described in terms of gradient of velocity potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 which satisfy @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "since finally we will discuss only the linearized equations in the perturbation @xmath20 , it is convenient to consider a single fourier mode of the perturbation @xmath21 with wave vector @xmath22 parallel to the boundary .",
    "the solutions of @xmath23 can be represented as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the velocities @xmath26 and @xmath27 describe the undisturbed motion in the superfluid .",
    "the perturbation amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are assumed to be linear in @xmath30 and will be determined later from the corresponding boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "the pressure in the superfluid is a sum of pressures @xmath31 and @xmath32 the index @xmath33  refers to the values taken away at infinity .",
    "unlike previous considerations @xcite which are also linear in the interfacial perturbations , we have to retain the quadratic terms in the superfluid and normal velocities @xmath34 on account of nonzero value @xmath35 and product like @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "the mass continuity across the boundary gives at @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the velocity of the boundary , @xmath41 is the unit vector normal to the boundary , and @xmath42 is the mass current normal to the boundary . the densities",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 are the normal and superfluid densities , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the density of the solid phase",
    ". the normal components of velocities can be approximated by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we also believe that there is no motion in the solid phase , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "to further simplifications , we suppose the normal component sticks to the interface like a viscid fluid . also , this implies the kapitza resistance to be infinite @xcite .",
    "in addition , we disregard any excitations , e.g. phonons , in the solid .",
    "so , we put at the boundary @xmath50 using eqs .",
    "( [ f01 ] ) , ( [ f03 ] ) , and ( [ f04 ] ) , we can determine the unknown amplitudes in ( [ f01 ] ) and then the velocity fields @xmath15 and @xmath14 in the liquid . for the unperturbed motion ,",
    "it is obvious @xmath51 the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath28 are given approximately by @xmath52 as a result , we can also calculate the pressure field ( [ f02 ] ) in the liquid",
    ". the boundary conditions ( [ f03 ] ) and ( [ f04 ] ) in combination with the obvious relations ( [ f05 ] ) determine unambiguously the inertial properties of the interface described in terms of the effective density @xcite @xmath53 in the sense that @xmath54    to proceed further , we adopt the most simplifying assumptions @xcite to describe the solid and its boundary .",
    "the solid is assumed to be always unstressed and all possible shearing components @xmath55 of the stress tensor @xmath56 are neglected . in other words ,",
    "the stress tensor is isotropic , i.e. , @xmath57 , and we can define pressure  according to @xmath58 @xcite . then , from the formal point of view , the solid can be described as a liquid under pressure equal to @xmath59 .",
    "the next boundary condition stems from the continuity of the momentum flux density across the interface .",
    "the momentum flux density in the superfluid @xcite reads @xmath60 .",
    "then , we take @xmath61 into account , assume the small curvature of the interface @xmath62 , and use a frame that refers to the boundary @xmath63 neglecting the quadratic terms in velocities gives the usual laplace condition of mechanical equilibrium across the interface @xcite . here",
    "@xmath64 is the surface stiffness tensor @xcite expressed in terms of surface tension @xmath65 depending on the angles between the crystalline orientation and the normal to the surface .",
    "let us turn now to the last boundary condition .",
    "it is a reasonable assumption that any motion of the interface accompanied also by the melting and growth of a solid will dissipate a certain amount of energy .",
    "thus a finite velocity of the interface should produce some imbalance in the chemical potential difference @xmath66 between the liquid and solid .",
    "the routine in various theories of the interfacial dynamics is an introduction of the so - called growth coefficient @xmath67 which relates the interface growth rate with the difference in chemical potentials across the interface @xcite . because of @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath69 we again have to take into account the squares of velocities which are always omitted in the linear perturbation theory of the interface being initially at rest .",
    "so , at the boundary we employ an effective relation @xmath70\\ , , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the chemical potentials of the liquid and solid per unit mass . in a wide sense",
    "the growth coefficient here is a certain combination of all onsager coefficients and the kinetic coefficients describing the near - surface dissipative processes . in general , the growth coefficient @xmath67 can depend on the temperature as well as on the wave vector @xmath73 .",
    "usually , in the ballistic regime , when the mean free path @xmath74 of excitations is large , the growth coefficient is independent of wave vector . in the opposite hydrodynamic limit",
    "@xmath75 the growth coefficient may depend on the wave vector approximately as @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "lastly , we need an expression for the chemical potential difference . as usual ,",
    "the reference point is the melting pressure @xmath77 at which the chemical potentials @xmath71 and @xmath72 coincide and the liquid - solid transition takes place . we take the necessary formulae for the superfluid from ref .",
    "@xcite . after expanding chemical potentials in the vicinity of the melting pressure ,",
    "we obtain @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the entropy and the quantities with index @xmath33 stand for the magnitudes taken far from the interface .",
    "now we are in position to find the equations which the interface dynamics obeys .",
    "knowing velocity potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 expressed via @xmath80 and perturbation @xmath30 , we can calculate the normal and superfluid velocities , pressure , and chemical potential difference .",
    "next , we insert the quantities calculated at the interface into the boundary conditions ( [ f06 ] ) and ( [ f07 ] ) and eliminate the pressure @xmath59 . as a result of some algebraic formula manipulation linear in @xmath81 , we obtain an equation consisting of the @xmath81-independent component and the other one linear in @xmath81 .",
    "the first component gives an equation @xmath82 + \\rho _ { \\text{ef}}\\!\\left(\\dot{v}l+\\frac{v^2}{2}\\right ) , \\nonumber\\ ] ] which describes the undisturbed motion of the flat interface and relates overpressure @xmath83 to @xmath84 in a complicated manner in order to support the necessary behavior of the growth rate .",
    "this equation does not have much interest for us .",
    "the other equation obtained is the most significant one .",
    "it represents the equation for the linear dynamics of the interface perturbation @xmath85 when the interface is subjected to an arbitrary driving acceleration @xmath86 @xmath87\\,\\zeta _ q = 0 .\\ ] ] the new aspect of the equation derived is an additional term with the interface acceleration @xmath86 .",
    "as is expected , the uniform motion of the interface at @xmath88 does not influence the character of small interfacial oscillations . for @xmath89 , eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) amounts to the known relation determining the spectrum of crystallization waves when the melting - crystallization processes are balanced and the interface position in average is invariable , i.e. , @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , more realistic and complicated models of the superfluid - crystal @xmath0he interface will improve the magnitudes of the effective interface density , effective growth coefficient , and surface stiffness . however , we believe that the structure of eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) is generic and holds .",
    "equation ( [ f1 ] ) can have unstable solutions depending strongly on the acceleration history of the interface .",
    "first , let us consider the stability of the plane interface with respect to small perturbations @xmath91 for the uniformly accelerated growth of a crystal .",
    "the root with @xmath92 means the interface instability , i.e. , initially small - amplitude perturbations of wavelength @xmath93 will grow exponentially in time . for the acceleration exceeding the threshold @xmath94 , the interfacial perturbation will increase for the wave vectors satisfying @xmath95 . for brevity",
    ", we put @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is unit vector in the direction of perturbation .",
    "note that the threshold acceleration @xmath99 does not depend on the growth coefficient , i.e. , on the dissipative properties of the interface , and is positive .",
    "the latter corresponds to the case when the interfacial acceleration @xmath100 is directed to the superfluid .",
    "thus , the taylor instability due to non - uniform growth of the plane interface appears only for the accelerated growth of a solid .",
    "the surface stiffness stabilizes the region of long wave perturbations and establishes the most unstable wavelength having the fastest exponential growth . the value @xmath101 corresponding to the maximum magnitude @xmath102 gives the shortest time scale for the development of the instability which will be characterized by the wavelength @xmath103 .",
    "the value @xmath101 can be found from the equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the value related to the upper bounds of instability according to @xmath106 .",
    "for large magnitudes of the growth coefficient or large acceleration in the case @xmath107 , the values @xmath101 and @xmath108 are approximately equal to @xmath109 the values @xmath101 and @xmath110 depend on @xmath111 , thus implying anisotropic and complicated possible surface patterns .    in the opposite limit @xmath112",
    "one has roughly @xmath113 it is interesting that , though the spatial scale @xmath114 is sensitive to the surface stiffness and its anisotropy , the time of developing the instability becomes independent of the surface stiffness and its anisotropy .    on the whole , the values @xmath101 and @xmath110 decrease as the kinetic growth coefficient reduces or dissipation with the interface enhances .",
    "from the experimental point of view this may require a crystal surface of sufficiently large sizes @xmath115 and a large time to support the accelerated growth @xmath116 in order to realize an interfacial instability with a uniformly accelerated growth .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that periodic modulation of the gravitational constant as @xmath117 can result in parametric excitation of crystallization waves at the stationary flat interface corresponding to @xmath118 in our case . admitting some analogy between gravity and noninertial frame , one can expect a possibility of exciting crystallization waves with a periodic driving , e.g. , @xmath119 , even with the lack of gravity . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) in the form @xmath120 where we have introduced the damping coefficient @xmath121 , the frequency @xmath122 of crystallization waves in the lack of damping , and the scaled accelerating amplitude @xmath123 @xmath124 then , if a periodic process of melting and crystallization is realized in experiment so that the interface could oscillate around some average position at frequency @xmath125 and amplitude @xmath126 , equation ( [ f2 ] ) with label @xmath127 transforms to a mathieu - type equation @xmath128 which is identical to that analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the predictions which follow are well known and we refer the readers to papers @xcite for details .",
    "note only that in the free crystal growth experiments @xcite the pressure in the cell drops drastically down after nucleating a solid seed with the subsequent transition to the damped oscillations around the melting pressure .",
    "crystallization waves at the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface can also be generated with the richtmyer - meshkov mechanism when the interface is subjected to an impulsive acceleration , i.e. , @xmath129 . in ordinary fluids and gases , for this purpose , the passage of a shock wave across the interface is commonly used . unlike the taylor case of constant acceleration when the perturbation amplitude in the linear regime grows exponentially in time ,",
    "the initial stage of interface instability in the richtmyer - meshkov case of shock acceleration @xcite is characterized by a linear growth of the perturbation amplitude in time .",
    "the richtmyer - meshkov instability is independent of the direction of acceleration in contrast to the taylor one . the late time stages of both instabilities may demonstrate a formal resemblance , showing bubble and spike morphology .    according to eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , the growth rate of the richtmyer - meskov unstable interface in the linear regime can approximately be described in the overdamped regime as @xmath130 and in the weakly damped regime as @xmath131 here @xmath132 is the initial perturbation amplitude at the interface immediately after the impulsive acceleration and @xmath133 is an increment in the interface velocity due to acceleration of the boundary . at the linear stage",
    "the amplitude of crests and troughs is approximately the same .",
    "the shape of the crests and troughs is similar and the interface remains approximately sinusoidal .",
    "staying in the linear regime , we see from ( [ f3 ] ) that the finite damping of crystallization waves is a stabilizing factor and can limit the growth of the perturbation amplitude .    next , we consider two extreme cases of @xmath134 and @xmath135 . for @xmath134 which corresponds mainly to the flat interface perturbations with small wave vectors",

    "the time for ceasing the growth of perturbation amplitude is scale - dependent .",
    "the larger the wavelength , the longer the decay time .",
    "a special feature of crystallization waves in @xmath0he is that the growth coefficient @xmath67 , and thus @xmath121 , is strongly temperature - dependent .    for the opposite case when the crystallization wave damping is absent @xmath138",
    ", we arrive at the persistent oscillations of the initial interface perturbation @xmath139 the maximum amplitude of oscillations is governed by the crystallization frequency @xmath122 . since roughly @xmath140 , the large curvature of the initial interface perturbation can also be a factor that limits the infinite growth of perturbation amplitudes .    in @xmath0he the richtmyer - meshkov instability can be studied with a sound wave pulse hitting the interface in the normal direction .",
    "recently @xcite , it has experimentally been demonstrated that the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface can be set in motion with a sound wave which transmits through the interface , giving rise to the processes of crystallization and melting .",
    "in experiment @xcite a solid nucleates at the needle point and then grows free . a ratio of the crystal sizes in the different directions for the crystals grown is not drastic .",

    "the small amplitude perturbations for the spherical surface of the solid phase are described by the relation @xmath158 for large radius @xmath159 and @xmath160 so that @xmath161 is fixed , equation  ( [ f4 ] ) goes over to the result for the plane geometry . under steady conditions @xmath162 the spectrum of crystallization waves on the spherical interface",
    "is determined from @xmath163 equation  ( [ f4 ] ) can have unstable solutions giving rise to the generation of crystallization waves at the interface .",

    ", we can make the following remarks .",
    "the large value of surface stiffness @xmath111 is a factor , first , for nonzero wave vectors @xmath73 , which prevents the development of the taylor instability .",
    "the most distinctive feature of the smooth crystal surface from the rough one is the existence of a non - analytic cusp - like behavior in the angle dependence for the surface tension , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the presence of a singularity leads to qualitative distinctions in the development of instabilities @xcite .",
    "first and foremost , the threshold magnitude and the conditions determining the development of the taylor instability prove to be dependent on the initial amplitude of the interfacial perturbation .",
    "the smaller the initial perturbation amplitude , the larger the necessary threshold magnitude of acceleration , approximately as @xmath172 .",
    "we note here that the onset of the taylor instability is favored at the vicinal surfaces whose orientations are tilted by a small angle with respect to the high - symmetry faceted ones .",
    "the larger the slope of the vicinal plane , the smaller the initial amplitude of interfacial perturbations is required for the development of the instability at the same magnitudes of acceleration .    the constant acceleration of an interface works like an effective gravity .",
    "hence , the physical picture for the taylor case of constant acceleration is analogous to the gravity - driven fingering of a crystal atop a fluid and can qualitatively be interpreted in terms of an effective amplitude - dependent stiffness @xmath173 @xcite . for sufficiently large perturbation amplitudes",
    "@xmath81 , the difference between the cases of smooth and rough crystal surfaces disappears .    in the case of impulusively",
    "accelerated smooth interface , the very initial stage of instability will be similar to that of a rough surface with the perturbation amplitude increasing linearly in time .",
    "insensitivity to the surface state results from the fact that the inertial properties of the interface , associated with its effective density , are mainly responsible for a linear response on instant loading .",
    "however , the specific time when the linear time growth of perturbations breaks down becomes amplitude - dependent for the smooth surfaces and shorter as compared to the rough surfaces .",
    "experimental and theoretical study of these effects can be useful for clarifying physical aspects of the crystal @xmath0he growth under high drives and fast dynamics .",
