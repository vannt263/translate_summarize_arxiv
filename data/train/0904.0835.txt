    "the bound - electron @xmath0 factor has been the subject of intense investigations over the past decade , both experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "it describes the response of the bound electron to an external homogeneous magnetic field and is naturally different from the @xmath0 factor of a free electron , due to the binding of the electron to the nucleus .",
    "recent measurements for hydrogenlike ions with a spinless nucleus in the region of low nuclear charge number @xmath3 have been reported and discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for precision experiments with trapped hydrogenlike ions ,",
    "the most important atomic state to be considered is the ground state , and we restrict the discussion to the @xmath0 factor of the electronic ground state , for which we write @xmath4 . from the relativistic ( dirac ) theory of the bound electron ( which does not include radiative corrections ) ,",
    "one obtains  @xcite @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath3 is the nuclear charge number . the negative sign of the correction terms of higher order in the @xmath7-expansion imply that @xmath8 for higher nuclear charge numbers @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , planned experiments in the high-@xmath3 region  @xcite have been termed `` 2@xmath0''-experiments .",
    "the quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) corrections to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor can be expressed as a combined expansion in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the latter parameter describes the strength of the coupling to the nucleus  @xcite .",

    "we recall that according to fig .",
    "21 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the number of two - loop diagrams contributing to the @xmath0 factor is large , and the particular diagrams considered here form one of the most straightforward gauge - invariant subsets in two - loop order . as the whole set of two - loop diagrams can be broken up into smaller gauge - invariant subsets , the evaluation could be initiated by considering gauge - invariant subsets . since the diagrams for the @xmath0 factor are related to those for the lamb shift ( except for the additional presence of an external magnetic field ) , a byproduct of our calculations is a confirmation of results obtained previously for the contribution of corresponding diagrams to the two - loop , binding correction to the lamb shift  @xcite of order @xmath15 .",
    "this brief communication is organized as follows .",
    "after a discussion of the one - loop correction in the order @xmath16 ( see sec .  [ oneloop ] ) , we describe the two - loop calculations in the order @xmath17 in sec .",

    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "first , we would like to rederive the leading vacuum - polarization correction to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor of order @xmath18 . to this end , we recall that for the interaction of an electron with a constant magnetic field , one can derive the following , effective hamiltonian based on long - wavelength quantum electrodynamics  @xcite for the interaction of an electron with an external static magnetic field @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bound - electron momentum , @xmath22 is the electron mass , and @xmath23 is the total static potential felt by the electron",
    ". this potential can be either the coulomb potential , which we denote by @xmath24 in the following , or a vacuum - polarization correction @xmath25 .",
    "we now briefly recall how to evaluate of the one - loop vacuum - polarization correction based on the effective hamiltonian and on well - known formulas for vacuum - polarization effects .",
    "indeed , we use the well - known uehling approximation for the vacuum - polarization potential and identify the potential in as @xmath26 , @xmath27 \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath28 .",
    "the first correction @xmath29 to the spin - dependent magnetic - field interaction energy ( and thus to the @xmath0 factor ) is obtained if we replace @xmath30 in the third term in brackets in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath31 = & \\ ; \\frac13 \\ , \\left < \\phi \\left| \\vec{r } \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{\\nabla } v_u}{m } \\ , \\right| \\phi \\right > \\left < -\\frac{e}{4 \\ , m } \\,\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\vec{b } \\right > \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes the nonrelativistic atomic ket vector corresponding to the atomic state under investigation ( here , the ground state ) .",
    "of course , the rightmost term in eq .",
    "is evaluated on the bound - state wave function , but we write it as being proportional to @xmath33 , where it is understood that for a @xmath34 state , the spin is either pointing up or down .",
    "this means that the expectation value on the right - hand side is to be evaluated using the spin degrees of freedom only , and it is therefore denoted by a simple bracket . because @xmath29 is a first - order spin - dependent energy correction in a uniform external magnetic field , it can be related directly to a correction to the @xmath0 factor . for this purpose ,",
    "we write the interactions as multiplicative corrections to the normalized interaction @xmath35 ; the latter leads to a @xmath0 factor of unity .",
    "the correction @xmath29 , which is a first - order correction , now has to be supplemented by some second - order effects .",
    "let us therefore consider the case where @xmath23 in eq",
    ".   represents the coulomb potential @xmath24 . in order to evaluate the second - order effects",
    ", we investigate the uehling correction in conjunction with the second and the third term in round brackets in eq .  , which represent corrections to the @xmath36 interaction of relative order @xmath37 .",
    "the perturbation to the wave function induced by the leading - order interaction @xmath38 vanishes .",

    "feynman theorem , @xmath41 the sum of the corrections @xmath42 leads to the known result  @xcite @xmath43 in the lowest - order in the @xmath7 expansion , eq",
    ".   then immediately leads to the leading - order vacuum - polarization correction to the @xmath0 factor  @xcite , @xmath44 where the index @xmath45 reminds us of the uehling potential .",
    "we now consider the wave function slope and the @xmath46 correction . according to schwinger s textbook  @xcite , one can obtain the vacuum - polarization correction of order @xmath47 to the lamb shift by considering the slope of the bound - state wave function at the origin .",
    "this holds equally well for the @xmath0 factor .",
    "the reason is that the bound - state wave function decays exponentially as @xmath48 whereas the uehling potential decays much faster , namely according to eq .   as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is of the order of the electron rest mass . in",
    "the resulting product @xmath51 = & \\ ; \\exp ( - \\lambda r ) \\",
    ", \\left ( 1 - z \\alpha m r +   { \\mathcal o}(r^2 ) \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can thus expand in the first argument of the exponential , using @xmath52 . the correction term",
    "@xmath53 corresponds to the slope of the wave function at the origin .",
    "a straightforward evaluation gives the following vacuum - polarization correction for the ground state : @xmath54 which includes the correction of relative order @xmath7 .",
    "we here confirm the result of ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness , it is useful to recall the corresponding one - loop vacuum - polarization correction to the lamb shift , which reads  @xcite @xmath55 this concludes the consideration of the one - loop vacuum - polarization correction of order @xmath47 to the @xmath0 factor .",
    "feynman diagrams for the two - loop vacuum - polarization corrections to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor .",
    "the first of these is the loop - after - loop uehling vacuum - polarization correction and gives a contribution of @xmath56 in units of @xmath57 for the @xmath0 factor .",
    "the sum of the second and third diagram ( upper row ) , which are iterated one - loop perturbations , yields a contribution of @xmath58 in the same units .",
    "the two last two diagrams ( lower row ) are klln",
    " sabry diagrams .",
    "they lead to a @xmath0 factor correction of @xmath59 . ]",
    "we now discuss the two - loop calculation .",
    "the leading - order result  @xcite follows as we replace the uehling potential @xmath60 in eq .   by the klln ",
    "sabry  @xcite term .",
    "it reads @xmath61 the klln ",
    "sabry  term is a genuine two - loop effect , and one might wonder why the iterated one - loop diagrams do not also contribute in the order @xmath62 ( these correspond to the second and third diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , the first - order correction to the wave function induced by the leading - order magnetic interaction @xmath63 vanishes , and the remaining contribution due to the iterated uehling term cancels explicitly in third - order perturbation theory , because the term with the magnetic interaction `` in the middle '' cancels against the derivative term obtained by considering the derivative of the second - order uehling correction with respect to the bound - state energy .    for some of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath0 factor correction of order @xmath15 can be obtained by expanding the wave function about the origin , as it was done for the one - loop theory .",
    "an example is the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which can be expressed as the expectation value of the loop - after - loop uehling potential , evaluated with wave functions perturbed by the magnetic interaction . for the other diagrams ,",
    "the calculation is more complicated .",
    "in particular , since the iterated uehling correction ( second and third diagram in the first row in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    ") contributes at the order of @xmath15 , one can not avoid the complete calculation of the ( first - order ) perturbation to the wave function by the uehling correction , which involves exponentials , exponential integrals , logarithms and powers of the radial variable .",
    "e.g. , the magnetic interaction in the middle vertex demands a further integration over the radial coordinate .",
    "the further calculation proceeds along the lines outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite for the two - loop vacuum - polarization corrections to the lamb shift .",
    "we finally obtain for the two - loop binding contribution @xmath64 due to the diagrams in fig .",

    ", it is useful to compare our results to those for the lamb shift , selecting the corresponding set of diagrams . for the lamb shift",
    ", we can identify the diagrams corresponding to those in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by simply eliminating the interaction with the external magnetic field .",

    "this concludes our two - loop vacuum - polarization calculations .",
    "in this brief report , we describe the evaluation of a part of the binding , vacuum - polarization correction to the bound - electron @xmath0 factor .",
    "the vacuum - polarization corrections represent a preparatory calculation for the self - energy corrections , which are much more difficult to evaluate . in view of the multitude of terms generated in comparison to the corresponding self - energy correction to the lamb shift of order @xmath69 , and in view of the additional complexity of the calculation due to the added external magnetic field",
    ", considerable difficulties are expected .",
    "it may , already at this point , be permitted to speculate a little about the magnitude of the complete correction to the @xmath0 factor of order @xmath15 , which is less than an estimate but perhaps more than just guesswork .",
    "namely , we observe there appears to be a rather universal factor in the range of @xmath70 by which the @xmath0 factor coefficients of a given order in the @xmath7-expansion are larger than the corresponding lamb shift coefficients for the ground state .",
    "in particular , we compare in the order @xmath18 , the coefficient @xmath71 in to the coefficient @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( the @xmath0 factor coefficient is larger than the lamb shift coefficient by a relative factor four ) . at relative order @xmath7 ,",
    "the relative factor is @xmath73 ( the coefficients are @xmath74 versus  @xmath75 ) .",
    "for the @xmath0 factor at two - loop order , the relative factor at @xmath15 is @xmath76 , as evident from eqs .   and  .",
    "a factor in the range @xmath77 also appears for the self - energy corrections .",
    "we recall that the complete two - loop correction to the lamb shift in the order @xmath15 is  @xcite @xmath78 our `` educated guess '' for the complete correction to the @xmath0 factor thus is @xmath79 the magnitude of this estimate of the coefficient generates obvious interest .",
