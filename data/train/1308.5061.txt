    "transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) layered materials @xcite possess unique electronic,@xcite optical,@xcite and mechanical properties .",
    "@xcite moreover , when used together with graphene and bn sheets , they show promise for construction of ultra - thin flexible devices based solely on two - dimensional layers .",
    "@xcite first steps in this direction have recently been demonstrated with the fabrication of transistors , inverters , and memory cells .",
    "@xcite    in order to further expand the range of properties achievable by the tmd materials , the pristine systems may be modified through doping @xcite or alloying,@xcite and also by modifying the layer stacking .",
    "considering the dramatic change from indirect gap in bilayer mos@xmath0 to direct gap in monolayer,@xcite significant changes might also be expected when layers of different materials are stacked .",
    "for instance , recent computational studies suggested that the band gap may be engineered by constructing tmd / tmd heterostructures.@xcite however , several questions still remain open .",
    "first , in the case of mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 , it was shown that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) are located in different layers ( often referred to as `` type - ii alignment '' ) . through a simple picture of single - particle band structure",
    ", such band alignment would lead to decreased band gaps .",
    "however , this is true only for the fundamental gap measured as a difference between the electron affinity and ionization potential , but does not necessarily hold for the optical transitions .",
    "in essence , it is not clear what kind of transition spectrum such systems would show .",
    "second , theoretical studies of other tmd / tmd heterostructures ( such as mos@xmath0/mose@xmath0 ) suffer from the problem of incommensurate lattice constants , which has so far been circumvented by only considering strongly strained systems .",
    "the energy cost for straining both layers and the lack of barrier for relaxing to unstrained state suggest that formation of strained heterostructures is unlikely .",
    "indeed , during epitaxial growth of tmd monolayers on graphene , the lattice constants were found to be very close to those of isolated monolayers , although with some preferential orientation among the layers.@xcite as strain is known to give rise to dramatic changes in the electronic properties of 2d systems , @xcite it is difficult to distinguish which features then originate from the stacking and which are due to the strain artificially introduced into the system due to computational limitations .    in this work , by using first - principles calculations , we study bilayer heterostructures consisting of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , mote@xmath0 , bn , or graphene . by constructing heterostructure models where both constituent layers retain their optimized lattice constant and including the electron - hole interactions through the solution of the bether - salpeter equation ( bse ) for the mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 system , we go beyond the body of previous work and give answers to the open questions listed above .",
    "we also discuss the optical properties of the systems with incommensurate lattices , and demonstrate that the optical characteristics of the monolayers are largely retained in these heterostructures .",
    "all calculations are carried out with plane waves and the projector - augmented wave scheme as implemented in vasp.@xcite the plane wave cutoff is set to 500 ev .",
    "exchange - correlation contributions are treated with perdew - burke - ernzerhof@xcite ( pbe ) functional including empirical dispersion corrections ( pbe - d ) proposed by grimme.@xcite the ions are relaxed until forces are converged to less than 2 mev /  . in selected cases",
    ", we also crosscheck our pbe - d results against ab - initio dispersion corrected functionals , pw86r - vv10 and am05-vv10sol , which have been shown to give layer distances in excellent agreement with experiment.@xcite    since the constituent monolayers have generally differing lattice constants , special care is needed in the construction of the atomic models in such a way that the strain is minimized .",
    "our approach is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] .",
    "let us denote the primitive cell basis vectors of a 2d material @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "the supercell basis vector may be constructed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are integers .",
    "the second basis vector is always oriented at an 120 @xmath7 angle .",
    "we then search for a set of integers such that the magnitude of the supercell basis vectors in materials @xmath2 and @xmath8 approximately match : @xmath9 . in practice ,",
    "we choose the smallest supercell for which the strain is less than 1 % .",
    "the resulting structures contain 75102 atoms .",
    "the two integers defining our models are listed in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "for all the heterostructures in this work , one layer is always mos@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we have fixed the lattice constant of mos@xmath0 to the optimized value of 3.18  , and squeezed or stretched the other layer slightly . these resulting lattice constants ( compared to the optimized ones )",
    "are also given in table [ tab : models ] together with the relative orientation of the layers as determined by the construction scheme .",
    "the perpendicular lattice vector @xmath10 is 25.44  .",
    "we employ 4@xmath114@xmath111 k - point sampling throughout .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) top view of mos@xmath0/mose@xmath0 bilayer heterostructure as modeled in our supercell approach .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculated , as well as experimental , lattice constants of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 are very close .",
    "thus , the heterostructure can be constructed simply from the primitive cells of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 with negligible strain .",
    "the stacking adopted here corresponds to that found in 2h - mos@xmath0 i.e. , chalcogen sublattice of one layer overlaps with transition metal sublattice of the other layer . due to the large spin - orbit splitting of vbm states near k - point , spin - orbit coupling",

    "the band structures are calculated for all systems at the pbe level .",
    "the electronic states from the supercell calculations are projected to the primitive cells of each constituent layer , following ref .  .",
    "note , that when the layer orientations do not align , also the brillouin zone high - symmetry points for the two constituent monolayers reside at different points of the reciprocal space , as illustrated in fig .",

    "is first projected to one of the monolayers and then to the specific brillouin zone segment of the respective layer .",
    "although the quasiparticle gap from @xmath14 is strongly influenced by the size of vacuum , all the main features of the band structure are correctly described by pbe.@xcite therefore , when the effects of interlayer interactions on the electronic structure are considered , the pbe level of theory is deemed sufficient .",
    "electron - hole interactions need to be accounted for when optical absorption spectra are considered . in the calculations of optical spectra , we rely on the single - shot @xmath15 procedure together with solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in the tamm - dancoff approximation.@xcite due to computational cost involved , this is only done for the mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 system .",
    "hybrid functionals are known to improve the starting electronic structure,@xcite and thus the @xmath15 is solved on top of hse band structure .",
    "atomic geometry is obtained using pbe - d with lattice constant @xmath16  , which leads to mo - w distance of @xmath17  over the vacuum region . note that unlike the @xmath14 gaps , the optical transitions from bse are fairly insensitive to the amount of vacuum in the calculation.@xcite spin - orbit interaction is fully accounted for .",
    "the adopted 12@xmath1112@xmath111 k - point mesh is mostly sufficient for proper description of excitons.@xcite for monolayer , we have 192 states in the calculation and for bilayer 288 states ( scaled with the supercell volume ) .",

    "on the other hand , it allows one to achieve stronger monolayer - like optical absorption from the layered tmd materials by simply stacking them together . while our calculations do not give the dynamics of various scattering and recombination mechanisms , it is surely possible that the photoluminescence spectrum could be modified by the interlayer excitons .",

    "several trends can be observed : ( i ) for tmd / tmd heterostructures , the nature of the vbm wave functions around @xmath1-point leads to strongly split states .",
    "the magnitude of the splitting depends on the position of the states prior to the construction of the heterostructure .",
    "this behavior is akin to that found in bilayer tmd systems or even in simple diatomic molecules .",
    "we can not directly probe the sensitivity of splitting on orientation , but as it is observed in all systems here , we expect the orientation to have small effect on the splitting .",
    "( ii ) both the vbm and cbm states around k - point are consistently very close to those of the respective monolayers .",
    "as discussed above , this is due to the wave functions being confined in the transition metal sublattice .",
    "the small shifts of 0.10.2 ev are caused by formation of interface dipole between the layers .",
    "( iii ) bn and graphene work well to `` insulate '' the tmd monolayer so that their electronic structures remains very similar to the isolated layers , also around the @xmath1-point .",
    "the tmd / tmd heterostructures examined so far all yielded type - ii alignment , which may be advantageous in separating electron / hole pairs . on the other hand , in order to maximize photoemission , vbm and cbm should both reside at k - point and localized to the same monolayer ( i.e. , type - i alignment ) . among the structures studied so far , mos@xmath0/bn was the only one fulfilling these conditions .",
    "this should also hold for other tmd / bn heterostructures .",
    "in addition , using the above trends and the position of band edges in isolated monolayers @xcite , the following systems are also expected to show type - i alignment : mote@xmath0/wse@xmath0 , mose@xmath0/ws@xmath0 , hfs@xmath0/zrse@xmath0 .    naturally , the monolayer - monolayer interactions discussed within this work are also applicable when substrate - monolayer interactions are considered .",
    "for instance , mos@xmath0 on bn substrate should still retain electronic structure very similar to that of a monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , such system was found to work very well for optical studies in ref .  .",
    "in case of tmd substrates , or more generally whenever there is strong interaction at @xmath1-point with the substrate , mos@xmath0 will easily become indirect gap due to the close energies of the valence band maxima at @xmath1- and k - points , whereas ws@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , or mote@xmath0 are expected to retain their direct gaps .",
    "the position of the band edges discussed above is naturally of importance for the optical properties as far as the valley population is concerned .",
    "the incommensurate nature of the heterostructures considered here also introduces a new issue of mismatch in valley location in the reciprocal space .",
    "that is , the wave vector corresponding to the k - point of the two monolayers have different length and orientation . for many of the tmd / tmd structures , the lengths are reasonably close , but the orientation of the layers is unknown .",
    "if the heterostructure is constructed by manually placing monolayers on top of each other,@xcite the orientation is likely to be dominated by the deposition process and the layers do not reorient after that . if the heterostructure is constructed during growth or restacking of layers exfoliated in liquid , @xcite the orientation might be determined by the total energy of stacking .",
    "since the k - points are aligned in mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 , this system is expected to show the strongest mixing in the optical transitions and the mixing should become smaller in tmd / tmd systems where k - points are misaligned . in the cases of tmd",
    "/ bn and tmd / graphene , there is very little mixing of the states around the band edges .",
    "since the transitions were seen to be largely decoupled in the mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 system , it therefore seems well justified to conclude that for all heterostructures examined in this work the optical absorption spectrum should be well approximated by the sum of its monolayer constituents .",
    "when interlayer excitons are considered , the misalignment of k - points would lead to indirect interlayer excitons .",
    "although physically interesting , carrying out full @xmath14+bse calculations on these systems is computationally demanding , and thus beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a set of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures were studied via first - principles calculations .",
    "the adopted computational scheme enables us to study unstrained systems , thereby moving beyond the artificially strained or naturally commensurate systems considered previously . with regards to the electronic structure , we find that the vbm at @xmath1-point is very sensitive to interlayer interaction in tmd / tmd heterostructures .",
    "consequently this determines whether vbm is located at the @xmath1 or k - point . on the other hand , heterostructures with graphene or bn show only negligible interaction .",
    "furthermore , we calculated and analyzed the optical transitions in the mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 system .",
    "the optical properties were found to be only very weakly affected by the interlayer interactions .",
    "novel optical characteristics of monolayer tmds should be largely retained even when stacked with other layered materials , which should prove useful for amplifying their optical response .",
    "however , engineering the optical gap through heterostructuring does not appear to work .",
    "optically inactive interlayer excitons were also found that are of interest in light harvesting applications .",

    "<S> we calculate from first principles the electronic structure and optical properties of a number of transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) bilayer heterostructures consisting of mos@xmath0 layers sandwiched with ws@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , mote@xmath0 , bn , or graphene sheets . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous works , the systems are constructed in such a way that the unstrained lattice constants of the constituent incommensurate monolayers are retained . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong interaction between the @xmath1-point states in all tmd / tmd heterostructures , which can lead to an indirect gap . on the other hand , states near the k - point remain as in the monolayers . </S>",
    "<S> when tmds are paired with bn or graphene layers , the interaction around @xmath1-point is negligible , and the electronic structure resembles that of two independent monolayers . </S>",
    "<S> calculations of optical properties of the mos@xmath0/ws@xmath0 system show that even when the valence and conduction band edges are located in different layers , the mixing of optical transitions is minimal , and the optical characteristics of the monolayers are largely retained in these heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of interlayer transitions is found to be negligibly small , a discouraging result for engineering the optical gap of tmds by heterostructuring . </S>"
