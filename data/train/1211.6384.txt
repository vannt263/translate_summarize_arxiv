    "microlens planet detections routinely yield the planet - star mass @xmath7 , but since the host star is generally very difficult to observe , the host mass @xmath8 ( and so the planet mass @xmath9 ) and the system distance @xmath10 usually remain undetermined . in principle , one can determine these quantities from the microlensing event itself , provided the angular einstein radius @xmath2 and the microlens parallax @xmath0 are both measured @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ratio of the earth s orbit to the einstein radius projected on the observer plane , and @xmath13 $ ] is the lens - source relative parallax , with @xmath14 generally being known from direct observation of the source .    to date , @xmath2 has been measured in the majority of planetary events , even though it is rarely ( @xmath15 ) measured in ordinary events .",
    "this is because planets are detected when the source passes near or over a caustic induced by the planet , which yields a measurement of the source size relative to the einstein radius .",
    "hence , if a method could be found to measure @xmath0 for a large fraction of events , the information returned from microlensing planet searches would be radically improved .",
    "the microlens parallax is actually a vector @xmath16 , with the direction being that of the lens - source relative motion .",
    "it can in principle be measured either from the ground @xcite , by combining space - based and ground - based observations @xcite , or from space alone @xcite .    when i proposed the pure ground - based method @xcite , i illustrated it with an event that lasted 4 years , so that the lightcurve oscillated annually around the standard microlensing form .",
    "in practice , such 4-year events are never seen , but @xmath16 can be measured from less regular features in shorter events . however , typical events have timescales @xmath17days , so that the great majority are too short to permit a measurement .",
    "@xcite proposed a purely space - based method using _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations .",
    "since the _ hst _ orbital period is only 1.5 hours , the oscillations are obviously much shorter than @xmath18 .",
    "however , the _ hst _ orbital radius is only @xmath19 , whereas typically @xmath20 .",
    "hence , the oscillations would typically be minuscule . to overcome this obstacle , @xcite proposed that the observations should be made during caustic crossings , which he showed dramatically increase the strength of the signal .",
    "however , alerting _",
    "hst _ to imminent caustic crossings is extremely difficult , more so for planetary events , and in fact such measurements have never been carried out , nor even attempted .",
    "the ground - space combination originally proposed by @xcite remains feasible in principle , but each event must be observed very frequently @xcite , implying a huge space - craft investment .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that a much simpler and cheaper ground - space approach was feasible for high - magnification events , but these constitute a small subset .    here",
    "i show that a single survey satellite in geosynchronous orbit is a near - optimal solution to this problem . as in my original proposal ,",
    "oscillations are induced on a standard microlensing lightcurve , but since these have periods of one day rather than one year , they are shorter than the event .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations is 6.6 times larger than those of the @xcite proposed _ hst _ observations . moreover , no special warning system is required .",
    "it is true that this approach only works for moderately high - magnification ( @xmath21 ) events , but these are more sensitive to planets than more typical events @xcite .",
    "hence , this approach can yield parallaxes for a large fraction of planetary events .",
    "moreover , such a geosynchronous survey satellite is a very real possibility .",
    "the @xcite report recommended a _ wide field infrared space telescope ( wfirst ) _ as its highest priority . a large fraction of the observing time would be devoted to microlensing planet searches . although originally recommended for l2 orbit , a geosynchronous orbit is now being actively considered .",
    "hence , it is most timely to investigate the implications of such an orbit for microlensing parallaxes .",
    "consider an observatory in circular orbit with period @xmath22 and semi - major axis @xmath23 . if this is an earth orbit , these two quantities",
    "are obviously related , but here i begin with the general case .",
    "let the microlensing target be at a latitude @xmath24 with respect to the plane of this orbit , so that the projected semi - minor axis is @xmath25 .",
    "i then normalize these axes to an au @xmath26    now consider that continuous observations of a microlensing event are made at a rate @xmath27 per einstein timescale @xmath18 , with signal - limited flux errors @xmath28 this condition is not as restrictive as may first appear .",
    "we are only concerned with scaling of the errors when the source is relatively highly magnified , so that this form need not hold all the way down to baseline , where sky and blending may be important .",
    "let the lens pass the source on its right at an angle @xmath29 relative to the major projected axis of the satellite orbit , with impact parameter @xmath30 ( in units of @xmath2 ) .",
    "then the lens - source separation vector @xmath31 ( in units of @xmath2 ) is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the time of closest approach , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the orbit phase relative to peak . by definition ,",
    "hence , @xmath38    the magnification is given by @xcite @xmath39 so that the derivatives of the flux with respect to the parallax parameters are @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unmagnified source flux . in order to make a fisher - matrix analysis",
    ", i first assume that the magnification does not change much over an orbit .",
    "this will ultimately restrict the result to events for which @xmath42 .",
    "i will discuss the more general case further below .",
    "i then evaluate the mean contribution to the fisher matrix , averaged over one orbit @xmath43",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45 and so obtain the inverse covariance matrix by integrating over all observations @xmath46 where @xmath47 in the limit @xmath48 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath49 figure  [ fig : deviate ] shows that this approximation holds quite well for @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) . using this approximation",
    ", we obtain , @xmath52 since the ratio of the quantities in the right - hand vector is never greater than @xmath53 ( and is @xmath54 for @xmath55 , which is typical of galactic bulge fields and an equatorial orbit ) , the parallax error is reasonably well characterized by the harmonic rms of these two values , @xmath56",
    "the fiducial values in equation  ( [ eqn : sigmapie ] ) are plausible for a _ wfirst _ style mission . for example",
    ", a continuous sequence of 3-minute exposures yields @xmath57 for a @xmath58day event .",
    "a large fraction of sources would have 1% errors in such an exposure , whether continuous or co - added .",
    "note that the formula does not really specify @xmath59 and @xmath27 separately , but just @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , for typical @xmath58day events and a @xmath61day orbit , the assumptions of the derivation basically apply for @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "of course , the integral in equation  ( [ eqn : gdef ] ) goes to infinity , while the observations do not , but the overwhelming contribution to this integral is from a few @xmath64 near peak .",
    "the fiducial parallax error in equation  ( [ eqn : sigmapie ] ) is quite adequate to measure the mass and distance of disk lenses but somewhat marginal for bulge lenses .",
    "for example , for @xmath65 , a typical disk lens at @xmath66kpc has @xmath67 , but a typical bulge lens at @xmath68kpc has @xmath69 . at the very least ,",
    "however , such a measurement would distinguish between bulge and disk lenses .",
    "naively , equation  ( [ eqn : sigmapie ] ) appears to require `` effective errors '' of @xmath70 , which must be achieved in the face of both astrophysical and instrumental effects . in particular",
    ", it would seem to challenge the systematics limit for real crowded - field photometry , even from space .",
    "however , what is actually required is not control of systematics to this level , but only control of systematic effects that correlate with orbital phase .",
    "this requirement is still not trivial for geosynchronous orbit because of phase - dependent temperature variations , but it is not as intractable as vetting all systematic errors at this level .",
    "nothing is known about stellar variability at this level in @xmath71 ( likely wfirst passband ) . even _",
    "kepler _ has only a handful of stars for which it can make measurements of this precision in its optical passband ( fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , again what is relevant is not variability per se , but variability on 1-day timescales , and @xcite report that fgk stars typically vary on @xmath72-day timescales .",
    "moreover , most forms of intrinsic variability are very subdued in @xmath71 band relative to the optical . see @xcite for a spectacular example of this in a microlensing event . finally , @xcite find that variability declines with increasing proper motion ( so presumably age ) , and the bulge is mostly much older than the disk , though perhaps not entirely @xcite",
    "one would nevertheless like a rigorous test that undetectable variability and systematic effects are not corrupting the results .",
    "fortunately the satellite data themselves provide such a test .",
    "@xcite showed that even very short microlensing events yield `` one - dimensional parallaxes '' from the asymmetry in the lightcurve induced by the earth s ( approximately constant ) acceleration toward the sun .",
    "that is , @xmath73 is well constrained while @xmath74 is very poorly constrained .",
    "normally , such 1-d parallaxes are not considered useful because the amplitude of @xmath0 ( and so @xmath8 ) is also poorly constrained . however , in the present case these 1-d parallaxes serve two very important functions . figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the lightcurve of a simulated event with 72 days of observations centered on the vernal equinox in each of 5 years , similar to the anticipated schedule of wfirst .",
    "the event is assumed to have the fiducial parameters from equation  ( [ eqn : sigmapie ] ) : @xmath58days , @xmath62 , @xmath75 , with @xmath34 right at the vernal equinox .",
    "the lower panel shows the difference between this event as observed from a geosynchronous orbit , and the same event observed from an inertial platform .",
    "note that since the orbit is equatorial , @xmath76 , i.e. , the components of @xmath16 in the east and north directions projected on the sky .",
    "the event is at @xmath77(18:00:00,-30:00:00 ) , and is assumed to have a parallax @xmath78 .",
    "the oscillations near peak are due to the satellite s orbital motion , while the asymmetries in the wings are from the earth s orbit .",
    "the latter are much larger , but yield only 1-d information .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ell ] , which shows the error ellipses due to 1 ) earth - only , 2 ) satellite - only , 3 ) earth+satellite . also shown is the result of the analytic calculation ( which assumed observations extending to infinity ) .",
    "note that there are two sets of solutions in each case , corresponding to the ( @xmath79 ) degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the first point is that if @xmath80 as derived from geosynchronous parallax agrees with the much more precise value derived from the earth s orbit , then one can have good confidence in @xmath81 , for which there is no direct test .",
    "this is true on an event by event basis , but more true for the ensemble of parallax measurements .",
    "the second point is that these two parallax measurements will be automatically combined in the fit to any lightcurve , which means that @xmath80 will be much better determined than @xmath81 .",
    "depending on the relative values of these two components , this may add important information in some cases .",
    "finally , the ensemble of geosynchronous measurements of @xmath80 provides a test of the accuracy of the 1-d earth - orbit measurement of this quantity from the wings of the event .",
    "this is important because the source stars may show variability on 10-day timescales , even if they do not vary on 1-day timescales .    using techniques similar to those used to derive equation  ( [ eqn : stdev ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the 1-d parallax error due to earth acceleration for short , relatively high - magnification events ( and infinite observations ) is @xmath82 where 58 days is one radian of the earth s orbit and @xmath83 is the projected earth - sun separation in au at time @xmath34 . since @xmath84 for bulge observations made during the equinoxes ,",
    "the ratio of geosynchronous - to - earth parallax errors is @xmath85 since the effective @xmath86day , this implies that the earth - orbit parallax will essentially always yield a precise check on the geosynchronous parallax in one direction .",
    "the derivation underlying equation  ( [ eqn : sigmapie ] ) breaks down for @xmath87 : the errors continue to decline with falling @xmath30 , but no longer linearly .",
    "they also become dependent on the orientation and phase of the orbit in a much more complicated way . from the present perspective , the main point is that the formula with @xmath88 provides an upper limit on the errors for events with yet higher peak magnification .",
    "next , the errors derived here assume a point - lens event .",
    "however , since the observations would be near - continuous , it is likely that caustic crossings or near approaches would be captured . as pointed out by @xcite such caustic effects",
    "can significantly enhance the signal .",
    "another feature of these ( and most ) parallax measurements is that they work better at low mass , simply because @xmath89 is bigger .",
    "space - based microlensing measurements have the potential to directly detect the lens when it is more massive ( so , typically , brighter ) .",
    "for example , as the lens and source separate after ( or before ) the event , their joint light becomes extended and the centroids of the blue and red light separate ( if the source and lens are different colors ) .",
    "these effects allowed @xcite and @xcite to measure the host masses in two different planetary events using followup _ hst _ data . because geosynchronous parallax works better at low mass ,",
    "while photometric / astrometric methods work better at high mass , they are complementary .",
    "finally , i note that such parallaxes would be of great interest in non - planetary events as well . without @xmath2 ,",
    "such measurements do not yield masses and distances , but they do serve as important inputs into bayesian estimates of these quantities",
    ". moreover , since the direction of @xmath16 is the same as that of the lens - source relative proper motion @xmath90 , a parallax measurement provides an important constraint when trying to detect / measure the source - lens displacement away from the event .",
    "if the magnitude @xmath91 can be measured from these data , then so can @xmath92 , which in turn yields the mass and distance ."
