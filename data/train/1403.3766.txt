    "theoretical models of water wave transmission by large groups of floating thin plates have been developed for over thirty years now .",
    "the models are used to help predict attenuation rates of ocean surface waves in the ice - covered ocean .",
    "however , the models have not yet been thoroughly validated via experimental data .",
    "the lack of validation is conspicuous now that attenuation models are being integrated into large - scale operational forecasting and climate models .    and @xcite used measurements of waves in the ice - covered ocean to provide evidence that wave energy attenuates approximately exponentially with respect to distance travelled .",
    "further , the measurements indicate that attenuation rates depend on wave period . in particular",
    ", the ice cover acts as a low - pass filter , i.e.  large period waves maintain energy for the greatest distance into the ice - covered ocean .",
    "@xcite developed the first theoretical model of wave attenuation due to ice cover .",
    "the ice cover is modelled as a collection of floating thin plates .",
    "attenuation results from an accumulation of scattering events .",
    "the scattering events themselves are due to impedance mismatches when a wave travels between a region of open water and a region in which a plate covers the water surface .",
    "the model is two - dimensional , with one horizontal dimension and one depth dimension .",
    "potential - flow theory is used to model the water .",
    "linear motions are assumed .",
    "consequently , the boundary conditions that couple motions of the plates and the surrounding water are applied at the wetted surfaces of the plates in equilibrium .    backscatter is neglected in the model , i.e.  a single - scattering approximation is applied .",
    "the wave energy transmitted by multiple plates is , thus , the product of wave energies transmitted by the individual plates .",
    "the model therefore predicts exponential attenuation , at a rate proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the proportion of energy transmitted by a single plate .",
    "@xcite was only able to approximate the energy transmitted by a single plate ( and hence the attenuation rate ) crudely . developed a method to calculate the full - linear solution for scattering by a single plate , and thus , in principle ,",
    "obtain the attenuation rate predicted by the model of @xcite .    extended the model of @xcite to include multiple wave scatterings , i.e.  multiple reflections and transmissions between plates . in the multiple - scattering model , unlike the single - scattering model , transmission by a single realisation of the plates depends on their configuration .",
    "disorder in plate locations and properties results in exponential attenuation of wave energy with distance travelled . applied a monte carlo algorithm with respect to randomly generated realisations of the plates to calculate a mean attenuation rate for a given wave period and average properties of the plates .    developed a similar model to ,",
    "but in which wave phases between plates are considered to be random variables , and the attenuation rate , rather than the transmitted energy , is averaged .",
    "they produced an analytic solution for the attenuation rate predicted by the model , in terms of the energy transmitted by an individual plate , under the assumption that only travelling waves interact between adjacent plates  the so - called wide - spacing approximation .",
    "the resulting attenuation rate is , somewhat bewilderingly , identical to that predicted by the model of @xcite .",
    "the linear potential - flow / thin - plate model has been extended to three dimensions .",
    "the plates are commonly assumed to be disks .",
    "developed two methods to solve the component model of wave scattering by a single disk .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of wave energy transport through an array of identical disks , based on a single - scattering assumption .    ,",
    "and @xcite developed a three - dimensional model that includes multiple wave scattering .",
    "however , the model relies on an artificial periodicity in one horizontal dimension .",
    "a less restrictive multiple - scattering model is yet to be developed .",
    "the role of multiple scatterings in three dimensions is , hence , unclear .    ,",
    "@xcite and compared model predictions of attenuation rates against attenuation rates extracted from field data , which were reported by and @xcite .",
    "the data were recorded in 1979 , and were , until recently , the most complete data sets available on wave attenuation in the ice - covered ocean .",
    "the comparisons indicate broadly reasonable model / data agreement for mid - range wave periods . however , the comparisons are far from comprehensive in terms of the properties of the ice cover and wave field .",
    "notably , the experimental data lacks information on incident wave amplitudes .",
    "@xcite recently reported attenuation rates extracted from field measurements made in 2012 .",
    "the measurements indicate that attenuation rates vary significantly between small- and large - amplitude waves .    here , results of a laboratory experimental campaign to study transmission of regular water waves by large arrays of floating disks are reported .",
    "the results are compared to predictions given by two- and three - dimensional linear potential - flow / thin - plate models .",
    "the investigation represents , to the authors knowledge , the first experimental validation of the models , as models of water wave transmission by an array of thin floating disks , as opposed to models of wave attenuation in the ice - covered ocean .",
    "the investigation also contains the first validation of rigid - body motions of a solitary disk in response to wave forcing , as predicted by the models .",
    "@xcite provided the only previous related validation .",
    "however , @xcite applied artificial restraints to the disk to match the model assumptions , as part of the experimental set - up . in particular , a rod was used to restrict surge motions , and a barrier was attached to the edge of the disk to prevent wave overwash .",
    "the model - data comparisons presented here indicate that linear potential - flow / thin - plate theory predicts wave transmission accurately for small incident wave amplitudes and low disk concentrations . for large incident wave amplitudes and high concentrations",
    "the wave energy transmitted in the experiments is significantly less that that predicted by the models .",
    "the discrepancies are attributed to the unmodelled dissipative processes of wave overwash of the disks and collisions between disks .",

    "the disks have mass of approximately 14 kg , and a draught of @xmath5 mm .",
    "the young s modulus of the wood used for the disks was measured as @xmath6gpa , using a cantilevered beam .",
    "the disks are , therefore , approximately rigid .",
    "each disk was loosely moored to the basin floor .",
    "the mooring system consisted of a series of three springs and a steel cable .",
    "the natural period of the moored disks was measured as @xmath7s , which is at least an order of magnitude greater than the wave periods used .",
    "the mooring therefore permitted the disks to respond naturally in rigid - body motions to wave forcing , but returned the disks to the same initial locations for each test .",
    "a low- and a high - concentration array of the disks were considered .",
    "eighty disks were used for the high - concentration array .",
    "the centres of the disks formed a 1 m by 1 m square lattice with five rows and sixteen columns , i.e.  adjacent disks almost touching in equilibrium .",
    "the equilibrium concentration of the disks on the water surface was approximately @xmath8 .",
    "the low - concentration array was formed by removing alternate disks from the high - concentration array .",

    "regular waves of a prescribed target period , @xmath10 , and target amplitude , @xmath11 , were generated by the wave maker .",
    "two groups of probes were used to measure the wave field before and after the disks .",
    "figure  [ fig : bgoschem ] indicates the location of the probes .",
    "the groups consist of ( i ) a line of probes in the direction of the incident wave , and ( ii ) a pentagon of probes , to analyse the directional spectrum of the waves ( not considered here , see  [ sec : multidisks ] ) .",
    "the probes have an accuracy of at least 1 mm , and a sampling frequency 250hz .",
    "target wave periods used for the tests were in the range 0.65s to 2s .",
    "target wave amplitudes of 10 mm , 15 mm and 20 mm were used for wave periods 0.65s to 0.8s , 0.95s and 1.1s to 2s , respectively .",
    "larger wave amplitudes were also used for selected wave periods . for all period / amplitude combinations the wave steepness was less than 0.05 to avoid wave breaking .",
    "table  [ tab : tests ] provides a summary of the tests conducted .",
    "a subset of the tests were repeated .",
    "accelerometers were attached to six of the disks .",
    "four of the accelerometers were triaxial and two were biaxial , in the plane of the disk surface .",
    "the six chosen disks comprised two disks from the front row , two from the middle row and two from the back row .",
    "the disks were in the off - centre columns , and hence formed two lines of three disks .",
    "tests were also conducted for a single disk . the target periods and amplitudes used for the single - disk tests were identical to those used for the low - concentration array tests .",
    "the krypton motion tracking system was used to record the six rigid - body motions of the disk during the tests .",
    "three light - emitting diodes ( leds ) were attached to the disk .",
    "the leds were monitored by a camera , mounted on a platform approximately two metres away from the disk .",

    "the translations have a maximum error of 1 mm , and the rotations 0.1 degree .",
    "consider a plane wave incident on a group of floating disks , for a water domain of finite depth and laterally unbounded .",
    "the aim is to calculate the proportion of incident wave energy transmitted by the disks .",
    "a cartesian coordinate system @xmath12 is used to define positions in the water , where @xmath13 are the horizontal coordinates and @xmath14 is the vertical coordinate .",
    "the vertical coordinate points upwards and has its origin set to coincide with the undisturbed free surface of the water . under wave motion ,",
    "the location of the free surface is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes time . a flat impermeable floor bounds the lower surface of the water .",
    "the location of the floor is @xmath17 .",
    "the water is assumed to be homogeneous , incompressible , inviscid and in irrotational motion .",
    "it follows that the velocity field can be defined as the gradient of a velocity potential , @xmath18 .",

    "similarly , the free surface is expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the ( reduced ) surface displacement .",
    "it is assumed that the incident wave steepness is sufficiently small that motions can be modelled accurately by linear theory . in the absence of the disks ,",
    "the velocity potential satisfies laplace s equation throughout the undisturbed water domain , i.e.     [ eqns : water ] @xmath26 the velocity potential and surface displacement are coupled at the equilibrium surface by the dynamic and kinematic conditions @xmath27    respectively , where @xmath28 is a frequency parameter .",
    "kirchhoff - love thin - plate theory is used to model the disks .",
    "the motions of the disks are therefore obtained from the displacements of their lower surfaces .",
    "consider an individual disk and assume , without loss of generality , that the disk is centred on the origin of the horizontal coordinate system when in equilibrium .",
    "the displacement of the disk is denoted @xmath29 .",

    "the surface equations in the disk - covered region are thus @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a scaled flexural rigidity of the disk , @xmath33kgm@xmath34 is water density , and @xmath35 is poisson s ratio .",

    "the location of the centre of the disk , which has its equilibrium centre set to coincide with the origin of the horizontal coordinate system , is hence @xmath47 .",
    "the amplitude of surge motion , @xmath48 , is coupled to the velocity potential via the kinematic condition @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and the equation of motion @xmath51_{(x , y)\\in\\gamma } { ~ { \\rm d}}z { ~ { \\rm d}}s.\\ ] ] the velocity potential and displacement function are obtained by solving equations ( [ eqns : water]a  b ) in the open water regions , and equations ( [ eqns : plate]a  b ) in the disk - covered water regions , augmented by the bed condition @xmath52 in both regions .",
    "conditions ( [ eqn : freeedge ] ) and ( [ eqn : surge ] ) are imposed at the disk boundaries , and an equation of motion of the form ( [ eqn : eom ] ) is invoked for each disk to determine the surge amplitudes .",
    "appropriate radiation conditions must also be applied to ensure scattered waves travel away from the disks .",
    "a simplified , two - dimensional model is derived by neglecting motions in the @xmath53-direction , and using a geometry that is representative of a cross section in the @xmath54 plane . each individual disk",

    "for the boltzmann model , the transmitted energy is calculated as the energy contained in the transmitted wave spectrum in a small band around the incident wave angle , i.e.  @xmath94 the band width parameter is @xmath95 in the results presented .",
    "figure  [ fig : trans ] shows a comparison of the proportion of energy transmitted by the disks , calculated from the experimental data and the theoretical models .",
    "the incident amplitude , @xmath96 , is calculated from the experimental data , in this case , as the mean steady - state amplitude given by the ten probes on the beach side of the disks in tests conducted without the array of disks .",
    "the method is chosen to account for small attenuation of waves simply in travelling from the wave maker to the probes .",
    "error bounds for the experimental data are obtained as for the raos .",
    "the two- and three - dimensional models give almost identical predictions of the transmitted energy in the chosen interval of wave periods .",
    "both predict monotonic increase in transmission as wave period increases .",
    "small differences between the predictions are evident for wave periods approximately less than 1.25s for the low - concentration array and less than 1.8s for the high - concentration array .",
    "the transmitted energies interleave one another in the intervals that they differ .",
    "consequently , there is no clear characteristic behavioural difference for transmission between the two- and three - dimensional models .",
    "excellent agreement is found between the models and data for the low - concentration array of disks .",
    "the transmitted energy for the large - amplitude test using wave period 0.95s is the only exception to the excellent agreement .",
    "this is a consequence of significant amplitude dependence for tests using wave period 0.95s .",
    "the increase in amplitude from 15 mm to 30 mm causes the transmitted energy to reduce by a factor of approximately 0.6 .",
    "the effect of increasing amplitude found here for multiple disks is far more pronounced than for the raos of a single disk seen in  [ sec : raos ] , as may be anticipated .",
    "the amplitude dependence is again attributed to overwash . for the large - amplitude test",
    ", all disks were overwashed , despite attenuation of the wave amplitude with distance travelled through the array .    in comparison ,",
    "the increase in amplitude from 20 mm to 40 mm for tests using wave period 1.25s produces a very small increase in the transmitted energy , which is well within the bounds of uncertainty .",
    "all disks were overwashed in the large - amplitude test . however , as in the corresponding single - disk test , the overwash was weak .",
    "the results therefore indicate that weak overwash has a negligible effect on wave energy transmission .",
    "the models and data both predict that the high - concentration array transmits less wave energy than the low - concentration array . however , agreement between the models and data is significantly worse for the high - concentration array .",
    "the models and data do agree for the test using the largest wave period , @xmath97s , although , in this case , the incident wave is fully transmitted .",
    "note that the incident wave is fully transmitted in both the small- and large - amplitude tests .",
    "good agreement is also found for tests using wave periods less than 0.95s , where strong attenuation occurs .",
    "amplitude dependence is evident for the tests using wave period 0.8s . here , increasing the amplitude from 10 mm to 20 mm results in the proportion of wave energy transmitted being reduced by a factor of approximately 0.35 .",
    "however , the impact of the reduction is debatable due to strong attenuation of the small - amplitude wave .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to argue whether the models agree more closely with the small- or large - amplitude test .",
    "amplitude dependence is also evident for tests using wave period 1.4s .",
    "however , the dependence is weak . increasing the amplitude from 20 mm to 40 mm results in wave energy transmission being reduced by a factor of approximately 0.93 .",
    "the models and data differ most for tests using wave periods in the mid - range interval 0.95s to 1.85s .",
    "the experimental data indicates less energy is transmitted than the models .",
    "small differences exist for tests using wave periods 1.7s and 1.85s .",
    "it is notable that the models predict full transmission for these periods , whereas the experiments indicate 1.5% to 2.3% energy attenuation .",
    "differences increase for tests using wave periods 1.4s ( small amplitude ) and 1.55s , with the models overestimating transmission by a factor of approximately 1.1 .",
    "differences are greatest for periods 1.1s , 1.25s and 1.4s ( large amplitude ) , with the models overestimating transmission by factors 1.5 , 1.4 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "discrepancies between models and data for mid - range wave periods can not be attributed simply to extrapolation of small discrepancies for tests using the low - concentration array to tests using the high - concentration array .",
    "instead , it is likely that wave energy is attenuated due to collisions between disks .",
    "adjacent disks are separated by approximately 10 mm in the high - concentration tests , which makes the disks susceptible to collisions under wave forcing .",
    "collisions did not occur in the low - concentration tests .",
    "attenuation due to collisions is not included in the models .",
    "the strength and frequency of collisions during the tests are quantified here using data provided by the accelerometers mounted on the two disks in the middle row of the array . only the data from the accelerometers initially in @xmath42-direction are used , i.e.  the direction of the incident waves .",
    "collisions are detected using the following algorithm .    1 .   the steady state intervals of the acceleration time series",
    "are identified , as for the wave probes .",
    "a third - order butterworth filter is used to separate the high- and low - frequency components of the series .",
    "thresholds of two times the significant accelerations of the low - pass filters , i.e.  four standard deviations , are set .",
    "collisions are identified as accelerations in the high - pass filters with magnitudes greater than or equal to the thresholds .",
    "( collisions occurring repeatedly for up to ten consecutive time steps are regarded as the same collision , i.e.  collisions are allowed a duration of 0.04s . )",
    "figures  [ fig : test06 ] and [ fig : test11 ] show two examples of the algorithm , along with corresponding snapshots of a subset of the disks .",
    "figure  [ fig : collstats ] shows the mean number of collisions experienced by the disks per wave period , and the mean magnitude of the accelerations caused by the collisions .",
    "accelerations occasionally exceeded @xmath98 in two tests , which saturated the signals .",
    "the mean accelerations calculated thus slightly underestimate the true mean .",
    "collisions occurred approximately once per wave period for the test using wave period @xmath68s and amplitude 10 mm .",
    "surge amplitudes were not large enough to cause collisions in this test .",
    "collisions were , rather , caused by out of phase pitch motions of adjacent disks in the same column of the array . however , the collisions were very weak , and did not force collided disks to separate .",
    "thus , the initial configuration of the array was approximately maintained during the test , as shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : test06 ] .",
    "collisions occurred more than three times per period for the tests using a 2s wave period .",
    "surge amplitudes of the disks were largest in these tests . however , adjacent disks surged almost exactly in phase with one another .",
    "small differences in the phase of surge motions caused disks to collide , but , typically , weakly .",
    "collisions occurred approximately twice per wave period for mid - range periods . in the mid - range regime",
    "the collisions were at their strongest , as surge amplitudes and phase differences were large simultaneously .",
    "strong collisions caused collided disks to rebound and collide with the opposing disk .",
    "hence , two collisions tended to occur in quick succession .",
    "this behaviour can be inferred from the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : test11 ] .",
    "the strength of collisions in the tests using wave period 1.4s are strongly amplitude dependent . increasing the amplitude from 20 mm to 40 mm results in mean accelerations increasing by at least a factor 2.7 .",
    "( the true factor is unknown as the accelerations saturated the signal for the large - amplitude test . )",
    "weak dependence of energy transmission on wave amplitude for tests using wave period 1.4s is therefore attributed to dependence collision strength on wave amplitude .",
    "it is noted here that collisions can turn into rafting events when ( i ) relative motions of the disks allow for non - planar overlapping of edges , and ( ii ) the collisions are not so strong as to cause disks to separate due to a glancing collision .",
    "rafting events occurred in three tests , with respective wave periods and amplitudes 0.8s and 40 mm , 0.95s and 30 mm , and 1.1s and 40 mm .",
    "rafting events tend to develop in chains .",
    "chains of up to four disks were created in the tests conducted .",
    "figure  [ fig : rafts ] shows an example of a rafting event .",
    "the disk in the middle row and left - of - centre column is rafted for almost the full duration of the steady - state window , starting at 76s and lasting beyond 96s . the corresponding disk in the right - of - centre column is not rafted during the steady - state window .",
    "the low - pass filtered acceleration time series for the two disks indicates that rafting suppresses the motion of the disk .",
    "rafting also reduces the number of collisions experienced by the disk .",
    "the rafted disk experienced 22 collisions in the steady - state window , compared to 42 collisions experienced by the disk that did not raft .",
    "however , no clear relationship is found here between rafting events and wave energy transmission .",
    "results of the first experimental campaign to investigate transmission of regular waves by arrays of thin floating disks in a wave basin have been reported .",
    "the disks were wooden , with radius 0.495 m and thickness 33 mm .",
    "a low - concentration array , consisting of forty disks , and a high - concentration array , consisting of eighty disks , were considered .",
    "wave periods in the range 0.65s to 2s were used .",
    "wave amplitudes of 10 mm , 15 mm and 20 mm were used for periods 0.65s to 0.8s , 0.95s and 1.1s to 2s , respectively .",
    "larger wave amplitudes were also used for selected wave periods .",
    "the transmitted wave field was recorded with a group of ten wave probes .",
    "the key findings of the campaign are as follows .    * wave energy transmission increases monotonically , as wave period increases .",
    "wave transmission ranged from almost zero to full for the wave periods considered . *",
    "the high - concentration array transmits less energy than the low - concentration array .",
    "however , wave energy transmission is not a simple function of concentration for mid - range wave periods , approximately 1.1s to 1.85s .",
    "the lack of a simple relationship between transmission and concentration is attributed to additional wave energy attenuation due to collisions between disks for the tests using a high - concentration array . *",
    "the proportion of wave energy transmitted is strongly dependent on wave amplitude for periods less than 1s .",
    "doubling wave amplitudes , in this regime , caused transmitted energies to decrease by factors approximately 0.6 and 0.35 for the low and high - concentration arrays , respectively .",
    "reduced wave energy transmission for large - amplitude waves and small wave periods is attributed to additional energy attenuation due to the onset of wave overwash of the disks .",
    "* the proportion of wave energy transmitted is weakly dependent on wave amplitude for mid - range wave periods and the high - concentration array .",
    "doubling the wave amplitude for period 1.4s caused the proportion of transmitted energy to decrease by a factor of approximately 0.93 .",
    "reduced wave energy transmission for the large - amplitude wave , in this case , is attributed to stronger collisions , and hence increased energy attenuation .",
    "predictions of the energy transmitted by the arrays given by theoretical models were compared to transmitted energies extracted from the experimental data .",
    "the models used are based on linear , potential - flow theory to model the water , and thin - plate theory to model the disks .",
    "wave energy attenuation is due to an accumulation of scattering events .",
    "two two - dimensional models were considered .",
    "backscatter is neglected in one model .",
    "multiple scatterings between disks are incorporated in the alternative model , and the phase of the waves between the disks is considered to be random .",
    "both models provide the same expression for the energy transmitted by the disks .",
    "a three - dimensional model was also considered .",
    "the model is a version of the boltzmann model , and employs the single - scattering approximation .",
    "the key findings of the comparison of the theoretical models and the experimental data are as follows .",
    "* the two- and three - dimensional models give almost identical predictions of the transmitted energy .",
    "* model predictions of the transmitted energy agree with the experimental data for almost all tests using the low - concentration array .",
    "the only exception is the large - amplitude test using wave period 0.95s , i.e.  the test in which wave overwash of the disks appears to attenuate energy .",
    "* for the high - concentration array , the theoretical models agree with the experimental data only for tests using the largest wave period , @xmath99s , in which case all of the incident wave energy is transmitted , and wave periods less than or equal to 0.95s . for wave periods 1.1s to 1.85s ,",
    "i.e.  the tests for which wave energy appears to be attenuated by collisions , models significantly overestimate the wave energy transmitted .",
    "the overestimation is up to a factor of approximately 1.5 .",
    "model - data agreement for the low - concentration array and small wave amplitudes implies that in this regime :    1 .",
    "scattering is the dominant source of wave attenuation ; and 2 .",
    "linear , potential - flow / thin - plate theory provides a valid model to determine wave transmission through an array of floating disks .",
    "moreover , model - data agreement indicates that multiple wave scatterings do not affect wave transmission .",
    "however , the significance of multiple scattering on wave transmission can not be dismissed with the present investigation , because ( i ) multiple scattering is included in one of the two - dimensional models ; and ( ii ) no extension of this model to three - dimensions exists ( to the authors knowledge ) .",
    "the pronounced loss of model - data agreement for large - amplitude waves and the high - concentration array indicates that other sources of wave energy attenuation must be considered in these regimes .",
    "arguments have been given here that wave overwash of the disks and disk collisions are the additional sources of wave energy attenuation .",
