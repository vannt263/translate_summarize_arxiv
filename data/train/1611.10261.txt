    "in this section we present the methodology which has been applied in order to :    * prepare initial configurations with two spatially separated nuclei , * imprint the phase difference of the pairing fields of the two separated nuclei , * collide them to simulate nuclear reactions within the framework of tdslda .    the initial states for the tdslda calculations were obtained as self - consistent solutions of the static slda equations which for both protons and neutrons have the following structure : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the single - particle hamiltonian and @xmath14 is the pairing field , which are defined by functional derivatives of an energy density functional , and @xmath72 is the chemical potential ( for either protons or neutrons ) . to reduce the number of diagonalizations needed to get the self - consistent solution , we have used the procedure similar to the one adopted to compute initial states for a vortex - nucleus system in the neutron star crust  @xcite .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath73 for head - on collisions and @xmath74 for non - central collisions .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath75 and cut - off energy is set to @xmath76 .",
    "one has to keep in mind that @xmath77-components and @xmath78-components , forming quasiparticle wave functions , behave differently when expressed in the coordinate representation .",
    "while the @xmath78-components are spatially localized around the two nuclei ( as is always true for bound systems ) , the @xmath77-components are distributed over the whole space .",
    "thus one has to pay a particular attention when dealing with a system of two spatially separated nuclei , as they are entangled through the common @xmath77-components .",
    "for example , a discontinuity of the @xmath77-components is introduced if one generates separately ground states for two nuclei placed in smaller volumes and then combines them together in a larger volume .",
    "this is a typical method used in tdhf calculations , which is justified since the @xmath77 and @xmath78 components are decoupled for @xmath79 and one evolves only localized single - particle wave functions . in our case , however , this method will not work and therefore we generated self - consistent solutions for two nuclei in a box separated by a desired distance @xmath80 . in order to avoid two nuclei to move apart because of the coulomb repulsion , we have introduced an external potential : @xmath81 ^ 2 + \\delta^2 } , \\label{eq : v_ext}\\ ] ] which is uniform in @xmath82- and @xmath83-direction .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 is a small constant which makes @xmath85 smooth around the center of the box ( @xmath86  fm ) .",
    "away from the center of the box the external potential is linear @xmath87 , and generates the constant force which compensates for the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 is adjusted to keep the two nuclei at rest during the self - consistent iterations .",
    "an example of the potential @xmath85 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_ext ]  ( a ) .",
    "we used a shifted conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient ( cocg ) method to compute densities during iterations  @xcite .",
    "subsequently a direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hamiltoniansupp ] ) was performed , which provided the wave functions determining the initial configuration for both the projectile and the target nuclei contained in the common simulation box .",

    ", width=226 ]    the generated initial states are characterized by the pairing field that has the uniform phase over the box . however , one can change the phase of one of the nuclei without affecting the energy of the system .",
    "this can be done dynamically , using the phase imprint technique commonly used in experiments on ultracold atomic gases .",
    "namely , the additional external potential is applied for a certain time interval @xmath94 .",
    "the external potential has the following form : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a function which smoothly varies from @xmath97 to @xmath98 in an interval @xmath99 $ ] : @xmath100.\\ ] ] an example of the potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_ext ]  ( b ) .",
    "since the pairing field is proportional to the anomalous density @xmath101 , the phase of the pairing field for the left half of the box ( @xmath102  fm ) evolves in time as @xmath103 , whereas for the right half ( @xmath104  fm ) it evolves as @xmath105 .",
    "consequently after time @xmath94 the phase for one side gets an extra shift @xmath106 .",
    "the height of the potential @xmath107 is adjusted to introduce the requested phase difference @xmath5 within the time interval @xmath108  fm/@xmath93 .    finally , to collide two nuclei one needs to accelerate them up to a certain value of relative velocity .",
    "it is achieved by varying smoothly the slope parameter @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_ext ] ) to a larger value @xmath109 using the switching function .",
    "it is performed in a relatively short time of about @xmath110 .",
    "subsequently , the slope parameter @xmath111 is kept fixed until the two nuclei reach the desired relative velocity .",
    "once this velocity is reached the external potential  ( [ eq : v_ext ] ) is switched off ( within the time of 10  fm/@xmath93 ) , and the two nuclei collide .",

[",
    "fig : junction ] ) .",
    "the energy of the junction is associated with the spatial variations of the phase on the length scale defined by the contact size .",
    "it can be easily evaluated within the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) approach .",
    "namely , one can introduce the wave function of the condensate @xmath114 which is related to the superfluid order parameter with @xmath115 being the density of particles that belong to the condensate .",
    "this quantity will be temperature dependent and clearly vanishes at critical temperature @xmath116 .",
    "superfluidity in fermionic systems is regarded as a condensate of cooper pairs , thus @xmath117 has meaning of fermionic density .",
    "consequently the wave function is expressed as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the superfluid density of fermions , and @xmath9 denotes the phase . in general the total density of particles separates into superfluid and normal components @xmath120 and in the zero temperature limit the latter vanishes .",
    "the total free energy of the system is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the so - called landau term .",
    "since superfluid densities of both superfluids are equal this term does not contribute to the free energy of the junction .",
    "the gradient term has the form : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the effective mass of particles that form a condensate , and we assume @xmath125 which is the mass of the cooper pair ( @xmath126 is the nucleon mass ) . approximating the gradient by @xmath127 where @xmath17 is the length scale over which the phase varies from value @xmath128 to @xmath129 , one finds the free energy of the junction ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : junction ] ) : @xmath130 where we have applied @xmath131 , denoting @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the volume of the junction . in the zero temperature limit",
    "the free energy becomes the energy of the junction and the superfluid density @xmath18 becomes neutrons / protons density : @xmath134",
    "the total kinetic energy ( tke ) of the outgoing fragments is evaluated as follows .",
    "we divide the simulation box into two regions by a plane parallel to the @xmath135-plane , which defines left ( @xmath102  fm ) and right ( @xmath104  fm ) regions .",
    "subsequently we compute the average mass and charge numbers and the center - of - mass of the fragments in respective regions , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . from the time derivative of the relative distance @xmath139 ,",
    "we compute the relative velocity @xmath140 .",
    "we compute the tke of the fragments when they are well separated spatially ( @xmath141  fm ) as follows : @xmath142 where @xmath143 with @xmath126 being the nucleon mass . to check the validity of this simple formula ( [ eq : tke1 ] ) ,",
    "we have also computed the tke as follows : @xmath144 where @xmath145 , and the momentum is defined by @xmath146 the coulomb energy can be evaluated from the proton density : @xmath147 we have found that the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tke1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tke2 ] ) is very small , at most a few mev at certain times where fragments are close to each other and exhibit large deformations , which make multipole corrections relatively significant .",
    "the effect of the increased barrier can be included in the expression for the classical capture cross section .",
    "namely , the classical expression reads : @xmath148 where @xmath53 defines the barrier height and @xmath149 .",
    "the modification of this expression related to the pairing field phase difference reads : @xmath150 where @xmath151 with @xmath152  fm , and @xmath153 is the threshold angle below which the capture occurs at a given collision energy @xmath154 .",
    "the expression requires @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the lowest energy for capture without phase difference , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath157 .",
    "one can easily notice that for @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , the above formula is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ classical ] ) , with barrier height averaged over all angles : @xmath160 .",
    "thus the effect of the phase difference on the capture cross section will enter through the effective barrier height averaged over all phase differences . in the energy interval",
    "@xmath161 one may use the above formula to extract the angle dependence on energy , directly from the excitation function .",
    "namely in this case one obtains : @xmath162 in practice , however , this quantity will be contaminated by other effects like , _",
    "e.g. _ , quantum tunneling and nonzero width of barrier height distribution .",

    "the collision energy was set to @xmath169 , at which we have observed the most pronounced effect generating the largest tke differences of about @xmath170  mev ( see fig .",
    "3  ( a ) in the main text ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the phenomenological fusion barrier  @xcite .    in the figure",
    "one can see four curves representing tke(@xmath164 ) , although two of them practically coincide .",
    "they correspond to the cases of @xmath171 and indicate that the effect governing the tke behavior is related to the solitonic excitation , as the energy of the junction is the same in both cases .",
    "this fact also confirms that the effects related to josephson currents are indeed negligible , since in the case of @xmath172 protons and neutrons are transferred in the same direction , whereas in the case of @xmath166 the directions of induced currents for protons and neutrons are opposite .",
    "the other two curves correspond to @xmath167 and @xmath173 cases .",
    "the relative energy shift of these curves measures the magnitude of the contribution coming from the pairing phase difference for protons .",
    "thus , clearly the total effect reflected in tke comes from both proton and neutron superfluids , however the neutron contribution ( @xmath174  mev ) is significantly larger than the proton contribution ( @xmath175  mev ) .",
    "this we attribute to the fact that neutrons play more important role in the neck formation , whereas contribution of protons is effectively suppressed by the coulomb repulsion .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : pu+pu_dn ] , we show the average number of transferred neutrons ( a ) and protons ( b ) from the left nucleus to the right nucleus as a function of the pairing phase difference for neutrons , @xmath164 .",

    "the amount of nucleons transferred during collisions is the largest for the case of @xmath176 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the case of both protons and neutrons flowing in the same direction . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath166 the amount of transferred nucleons is the smallest , since induced josephson currents for protons and neutrons have the opposite directions , and due to the mutual entrainment the magnitude of the currents is suppressed .",
    "moreover , one can find a visible difference between the cases of @xmath173 and @xmath167 , despite the fact that the proton josephson current is absent in both cases .",
    "it indicates that the solitonic structure in the proton pairing field plays also a role of a barrier suppressing neutron flow . nevertheless in both cases ( @xmath177 ) a small number of protons are transferred , and it is only due to the neutron josephson current which entrain protons .",
    "to examine the effects of the pairing phase difference on the dynamics in asymmetric reactions , we performed exploratory calculations for @xmath68zr+@xmath69sn . in these reactions",
    "the phase difference is not well defined quantity , but it evolves in time and the evolution rate is determined by the difference of the nuclear chemical potentials . in the case of symmetric reactions ( like @xmath49zr+@xmath49zr ) the collisions for the phase differences @xmath5 and @xmath178 , are connected by reflection symmetry ( _ i.e. _  the symmetry transform one case into the other by exchanging the colliding nuclei ) and therefore the relevant range for the phase difference is limited to the interval @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "this is no longer correct for asymmetric reactions and one has to consider all phase differences that span interval @xmath180 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , we have observed qualitatively the same effect of the barrier enhancement due to the pairing as in zr+zr reactions .    for the asymmetric reaction , at energy below the fusion threshold , the natural process that takes place is the particle transfer ( due to difference in the chemical potentials ) .",
    "we observed that the phase difference can modify the amount of nucleon transfer .",
    "as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : zr+sn_dn ] we show the particle transfer for various phase differences of the initial state .",
    "depending on the relative phase of the pairing fields 46 neutrons are transferred .",
    "it is due to the josephson current that can either enhance or suppress the particle flow .",
    "the fluctuations in the particle transfer are about 2 particles , thus very similar to the other cases .",
    "the effects also induce indirectly variations for protons transfer .",
    "in the case of @xmath30pu+@xmath30pu collisions at sufficiently high energies , we have observed exotic reaction dynamics .",
    "namely , at energy @xmath181 the composite system splits producing the third light fragment for all phase differences @xmath5 .",
    "such a ternary quasifission process has been observed as well in tdhf approach  @xcite , indicating the possibility of emission of a light fragment in the collision process .",
    "interestingly , the third fragment is not at rest as it should be in the case of tdhf approach , where the left - right symmetry is being conserved in symmetric collisions in the center - of - mass frame . in our approach , however , the symmetry is broken due to the different phases of pairing fields of incoming nuclei .",
    "consequently , the josephson current appears as a consequence of the symmetry breaking component in the pairing field .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the third fragment is not at rest and is moving after splitting due to the current induced by the phase difference .",
    "moreover , at the energies @xmath182 and @xmath183 , we found that the number of fragments is affected by the phase difference . the situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ternary ] . in this case , the solitonic structure prevents the formation of the third fragment from the neck region .",

    "in order to investigate collision trajectories and their dependence on the pairing field phase differences , we have performed collisions with nonzero impact parameters .",
    "since we solve tdslda equations in 3d cartesian coordinates without any symmetry restrictions , we can also simulate non - central collisions .",
    "namely , we have performed simulations for non - central collisions of @xmath30pu+@xmath30pu and @xmath49zr+@xmath49zr .",
    "similarly to central collisions , the phase difference prevents superfluid nucleons to enter the neck region .",
    "it causes the suppression of the neck formation and consequently the reduction of the contact time . in the non - central collisions , however , the small variations of the contact time have a dramatic effect on the collision trajectories",
    ". consequently it affects both the scattering angle , as well as kinetic energy of the fragments and induces the correlation between these two quantities at a fixed impact parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zr_zrcol ] , we show an example of the non - central collisions of @xmath49zr+@xmath49zr , where the energy and the impact parameter are chosen in a such way that the system does not fuse , but splits after certain time . as is apparent from the figure , the pairing phase difference affects the contact time and consequently the scattering angles .",
