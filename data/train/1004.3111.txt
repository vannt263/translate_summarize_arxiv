    "atomic fermi gases have emerged as unique testing ground for many theories of exotic matter in nature , allowing for the creation of complex yet very controllable many - body quantum systems  @xcite , where for instance observation of the bcs - bec crossover has so far been the most important achievement in this field . following this huge success with single - species fermion mixtures ,",

    "this has recently been achieved with bose - bose mixtures  @xcite by applying a one - dimensional optical lattice to the @xmath5k-@xmath6rb mixture , where only @xmath5k atoms feel the lattice potential , and they are confined to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry , while having negligible effect on @xmath6rb atoms , that is leaving @xmath6rb atoms three dimensional .",
    "motivated by this experimental work , here we analyze cooper pairing in mixed - dimensional fermi gases .",
    "we consider both single - species and two - species fermion mixtures , and analyze the ground state phase diagrams in the bcs - bec evolution , which involves normal , gapped superfluid , gapless superfluid , and phase separated regions . in particular , the gapless superfluid phase , where the unpaired @xmath1 and @xmath2 fermions coexist with the paired ( or superfluid ) ones in different momentum space regions , is in some ways similar to the sarma state found in mixtures with unequal densities  @xcite , but in our case , the gapless superfluid phase is unpolarized and most importantly it is stable against phase separation . in this way ,",
