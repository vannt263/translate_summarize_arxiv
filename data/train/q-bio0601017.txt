    "<S> presented a two pathways , two bound states model with rapid equilibrium assumption between the two states . </S>",
    "<S> they suggested that the catch - slip bond transitions take place due to applied force switching the pathways from the one with slower dissociation rate to the fast one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this insightful viewpoint well described force jump - ramp experiments , there are two apparent flaws in physics . </S>",
    "<S> first if the forced dissociation experiments were performed at very low temperatures or higher solvent viscosities , force would be independent of the bond dissociations since the force in the two pathways and two bound states model only acts on the inner bound states , while these states would be  frozen \" under this circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> the other is that force does not accelerate the dissociation processes further when the force is sufficiently large for the fast dissociation rate is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> the next model given by barsegov and thirumalai  @xcite with same kinetic scheme seems to improve the two flaws in which the dissociation rates of the two pathways were allowed to be force - dependent with the bell formulas . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , so many independent reaction constants with arbitrary dependencies on the force parameters ( total seven parameters ) and the final dissociation rate depending on them in a complicated way make the physical explanations and the determination of the parameters difficult to track . very recently , a competitive two pathways and one bound state model was proposed by thomas _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model is distinct from the others because there is a catch pathway therein , which was thought to arise from a backward unbinding pathway . </S>",
    "<S> but the model is not intuitively obvious just like the authors pointed out .    as one type of noncovalent bonds , interactions of adhesive receptors and their ligands </S>",
    "<S> are weaker . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the interfaces between them have been reported to be broad and shallow , such as the crystal structure of the psgl-1@xmath0p - selectin bond revealed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is plausible that the energy barriers for the bonds are fluctuating with time due to either global conformational changes or local conformational changes at the interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> association / dissociation reactions with fluctuating energy barrier have been deeply studied by statistical physicists in terms of rate processes with _ dynamic disorder _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite during the past two decades . </S>",
    "<S> a prototype is the ligand rebinding in myoglobin where the rate constant depends on a protein coordinate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is of interest to determine whether the fluctuation of energy barrier responses to catch - slip bond transitions . </S>",
    "<S> such studies should be meaningful since in the bell s initial work and the other models developed later , the intrinsic rate constants @xmath2 were deterministic and time - independent . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to derive unexpected results from the relaxation of this restriction . </S>",
    "<S> stimulated by the two considerations , in the present work we propose that the intrinsic dissociation rate in the bell model is controlled by a conformational coordinate of receptor - ligand complex , while the coordinate is fluctuating as a brownian motion in a bound harmonic potential ; applied force not only lowers the height of the energy barrier as described in eq .  [ bellmodel ] but also modulates the distribution of the conformational coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to well predicting the experimental data , our theory may also provide a new physical mechanism for the dissociation rates suggested by bell  @xcite and dembo  @xcite early . </S>"
