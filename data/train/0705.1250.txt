    "polymer dynamics plays a central role in material science and biology . in particular , dynamics of an individual flexible or semi - flexible polymer under a suitable shear force",
    "has been of great interest  @xcite .",
    "shear force comes into play when a fluid flows past a surface .",
    "substantial effort has been undertaken to investigate the motion of polymers in shear field .",
    "previously , studies were done on bulk samples using light - scattering and birefringence experiments .",
    "recently , the dynamics of a single polymer has also been investigated using video - microscopy . under a shear stress ,",
    "such a polymer shows tumbling in addition to a longitudinal stretching  @xcite .",
    "if one takes a tethered polymer , whose one point is made immobile , then tumbling leads to a cyclic motion of the spatially constrained polymer about a mean position  @xcite .",
    "also statistics of polymer orientation angles has been of interest  @xcite .",
    "these properties studied both experimentally and theoretically can be classified as long - time transport phenomena .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we explore the persistence or the survival probability behaviour of a flexible polymer chain under transverse shear flow within the paradigm of the simple rouse model where the polymer chain consists of beads or monomers connected by harmonic springs  @xcite .",
    "we will show that even in this simple model , the persistence at late times decays as a power law characterized by a nontrivial exponent .",
    "the survival / persistence probability @xmath1 that a stochastic process @xmath7 does not cross zero upto time @xmath2 is a quantity of long standing interest in probability theory and with many practical applications  @xcite .",
    "the derivative @xmath8 is the first - passage probability  @xcite . in many nonequilibrium",
    "many body systems , the persistence has been found to decay as a power law at late times , @xmath3 .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 is called the persistence exponent and has been a subject of much theoretical , numerical and experimental studies in recent times  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 is often nontrivial and is generally hard to calculate analytically even in simple systems such as the linear diffusion equation starting from random initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difficulty can be traced back to the fact that the spatial interactions in these extended systems makes the local stochastic field @xmath7 a ` non - markovian ' process in time  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the persistence properties of a rouse chain in @xmath9-dimensions in presence of a transverse shear velocity field which is non - random .",
    "we show that the persistence probability in this system decays at late times as a power law with a nontrivial persistence exponent @xmath10 that we compute numerically as well as analytically within an independent interval approximation ( iia ) .",
    "we note , that the current problem is in contrast to similar problems considered in `` random '' flow fields earlier .",
    "for example , for a rouse chain  @xcite of infinite length , the transport properties  @xcite and the persistence properties  @xcite in a quenched random velocity flow field have been studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model precisely and summarize our main results . in section",
    "- iii we present exact calculations of the two - time correlation functions in our model .",
    "these results are used next in section iv to calculate the persistence exponent analytically within the iia .",
    "sections v and vi describe details of the numerical methods and finally we conclude in section vii .",
    "we consider a rouse polymer chain embedded in a @xmath9-dimensional plane .",
    "the chain consists of beads connected by harmonic springs  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the chain is advected by shear velocity flow field .",
    "let @xmath11 $ ] denote the coordinates of the @xmath12-th bead at time @xmath2 which evolve with time according to the following equations of motion @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the strength of the harmonic interaction between nearest neighbour beads , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the thermal white noises along the @xmath17 and @xmath0 directions respectively that are uncorrelated .",
    "the transverse shear velocity field @xmath18 is linear @xmath19 for a finite chain with @xmath20 beads , eqs .",
    "( [ evoly1 ] ) and ( [ evolx1 ] ) are valid only for the @xmath21 interior beads .",
    "the two boundary beads will have slightly different equations of motion .",
    "however , for an infinitely large chain ( @xmath22 ) , the translational invariance along the length of the chain is restored since the boundary conditions become irrelevant for late time dynamics .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the late time properties , one can make further simplifications by replacing the discrete index @xmath12 of the beads by a continuous variable @xmath23 and subsequently replace the discrete laplacian by a continuous second derivative along the @xmath23 direction .",
    "the coarse grained versions of the evolution equations ( [ evolx1 ] ) then become @xmath24 note that we have also dropped the @xmath25 term in the second equation .",
    "this is simply because one can easily show that the noise term @xmath25 becomes insignificant compared to the shear force term @xmath26 at late times .",
    "hence for late time asymptotic properties we can ignore the noise @xmath25 .    in the absence of harmonic interactions ( @xmath27 )",
    ", the beads become independent and the coordinates of any ( say the @xmath12-th ) bead represents a two - dimensional brownian walker in a shear flow@xcite .",
    "equivalently , in this limit , the @xmath0 coordinate of the walker evolves as @xmath28 , i.e. , it represents a randomly accelerated particle . the persistence probability of the @xmath0-coordinate , i.e. , the probability that the @xmath0 coordinate does not cross zero up to time @xmath2 is known to decay as @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "recently , the persistence of a single random walker for various other deterministic velocity functions @xmath18 has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "interestingly it has been shown that for all odd functions @xmath18 survival probability decays as @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the same @xmath31 decay also holds in the case when @xmath18 is not a deterministic function , but represents a quenched random transverse velocity field with short - range correlations  @xcite .",
    "this model of a single random walker in presence of a random transverse velocity field is known as the matheron - de - marsily model@xcite whose transport properties had been studied earlier extensively@xcite , but the studies of persistence properties are relatively new@xcite .    in this paper we study the persistence probability of the @xmath0 coordinate of the @xmath12-th bead in the presence of harmonic interaction @xmath32 . due to the translational invariance along the length of the chain in the bulk ,",
    "the persistence probability is independent of the label @xmath12 of the bead .",
    "we also absorb the factor @xmath14 by properly rescaling the time .",
    "note that the continuum equation ( [ yeq ] ) for the @xmath17 coordinate is precisely the edwards - wilkinson equation of one dimensional interface  @xcite and its persistence properties are known , both theoretically  @xcite and also experimentally  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the @xmath0 coordinate and define the persistence as follows @xmath33 ,   \\label{perx1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath1 is the probability that the @xmath0 coordinate of any bead does not return to its initial position within the time interval @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the initial conditions for the chain coordinates do not play any role in the persistence probability .",
    "this is due to the fact that the evolution equations are linear , so we can redefine the change in positions @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the relevant coordinates which satisfy the same evolutions equations .",
    "hence , for the evolution equations ( [ yeq ] ) and ( [ xeq ] ) we can set the initial conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 without any loss of generalities .    our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "we show that @xmath3 at late times @xmath2 where the persistence exponent @xmath4 has a nontrivial value .",
    "the numerical value @xmath39 , is in excellent agreement with the analytical value @xmath5 obtained within the iia method .",
    "thus as one switches on the harmonic interaction @xmath32 between the beads , the exponent @xmath40 increases from its value @xmath41 for @xmath27 .",
    "thus the @xmath0 coordinate of a bead survives less in presence of harmonic interactions , i.e. , the interaction enhances the return probability .",
    "the stochastic processes @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath26 evolving via eqs . ( [ yeq ] ) and ( [ xeq ] ) are both gaussian at late times since the evolution equations are linear . a gaussian process is completely specified by its two - time correlation function .",
    "more detailed quantities such as the persistence probability , in principle , is a complicated functional of the two - time correlation function . in this section",
    "we compute the two - time correlation functions exactly and use these functions later for computing the persistence probability in section iv .    to begin with ,",
    "we fourier transform eq .",
    "we define @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "thus , for simplicity of notations , we can now drop the label @xmath23 and consider @xmath56 as the relevant gaussian process with the correlator @xmath57 as given in eq .",

    "clearly the process @xmath56 is non - stationary since its two - time correlator in eq .",
    "( [ at1t2a ] ) depends on both @xmath58 and @xmath59 and not just on their difference .",
    "one can however define a logarithmic time @xmath60 and consider the normalized process @xmath61 in @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "the survival or no zero crossing probability is clearly the same for both the normalized process @xmath63 and the original unnormalized processs @xmath56 .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ at1t2a ] ) that the autocorrelation function of this normalized gaussian process @xmath63 is stationary in the @xmath62 variable and is given by @xmath64 , \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\exp(\\frac{5}{4}t)~ [ \\exp(-t)\\sqrt{1+\\exp(-t ) } \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\frac{1}{5 } \\left(1 + \\exp(-t ) \\right)^{5/2 } + \\frac{1}{5 }",

    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form of the stationary autocorrelator will be used in the next section to compute the persistence probability .",
    "we have thus mapped our problem to a gaussian stationary process in @xmath60 variable with a prescribed correlator @xmath65 and we want to calculate the probability @xmath66 that the process does not cross zero up to time @xmath62 . for a general correlator @xmath67 , the computation of @xmath66 is very hard  @xcite .",
    "however , some general results are known for the late time behavior of @xmath66 . for example , it is known  @xcite that when @xmath67 decays faster than @xmath68 for large @xmath62 , the persistence probability @xmath66 decays exponentially , @xmath69 . since , in our case , @xmath67 is eq .",

    "this would signify a power law decay of the persistence @xmath3 for large @xmath2 .",
    "thus the inverse decay rate @xmath4 in the @xmath62 variable is precisely the exponent of the algebraic decay in the real time @xmath2 .    while we were not able to compute the exponent @xmath4 exactly",
    ", one can obtain a very accurate analytical estimate of @xmath4 using the iia method that was first used in the context of persistence in diffusion equation  @xcite .",
    "this method works reasonably well only for _ smooth _ gaussian stationary processes .",

    "( [ nc0 ] ) , we can find @xmath75 from the above formula .",
    "the persistence probability @xmath66 is simply related to the interval distribution  @xcite , @xmath79 . since we expect @xmath66 to decay exponentially at late times @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath69 , it follow that the interval distribution @xmath75 will also have the same late time decay , @xmath80 with identical exponent @xmath4 .",
