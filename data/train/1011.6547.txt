    "in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , the soft supersymmetry ( susy)-breaking higgs sector is described by the lagrangian contribution @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the higgs doublet fields , @xmath7 the singlet one , @xmath8 and @xmath9 yukawa couplings while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are dimensionful parameters of order @xmath12 , the typical susy mass scale .    as a result of the introduction of an extra complex singlet scalar field , which only couples to the two mssm - type higgs doublets ,",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm comprises of a total of seven mass eigenstates : a charged pair @xmath13 , three cp - even higgses @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and two cp - odd higgses @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "consequently , higgs phenomenology in the nmssm may be plausibly different from that of the mssm and extremely rich of new signals .",
    "+ for a start , the sum of the squares of the two lightest scalar higgs boson masses is given by @xcite : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the last expression can be translated into a modified upper bound of the @xmath20 mass as @xcite @xmath21 so that the upper bound on the nmssm lightest higgs boson mass is higher than the corresponding bound in the mssm .",
    "furthermore , as the higher order corrections are similar to those in the mssm , also in higher orders the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass remains different in the nmssm with respect to the mssm , reaching 140 gev or so , for maximal stop mixing and @xmath22 @xcite ( a configuration indeed excluded in the mssm by lep data ) .",
    "more in general , the ` little fine tuning problem ' , resulting in lep failing to detect a light cp - even higgs boson , predicted over most of the mssm parameter space , is much attenuated in the nmssm , either because a sm - like higgs can decay dominantly into @xmath23 @xcite or because the mixing among more numerous cp - even or cp - odd higgs fields enables light mass states being produced at lep or tevatron yet , they can remain undetected because of their reduced couplings to @xmath24 bosons @xcite .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for benchmark points with very light cp - odd higgs bosons in both the unconstrained and constrained nmssm parameter space , respectively ) .    as for present accelerator machines ,",
    "chiefly the tevatron at fnal and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , quite some work has been dedicated to probing the nmssm higgs sector over recent years .",
    "primarily , there have been attempts to extend the so - called ` no - lose theorem ' of the mssm  stating that at least one mssm higgs boson should be observed via the usual sm - like production and decay channels at the lhc throughout the entire mssm parameter space @xcite  to the case of the nmssm @xcite . from this perspective , it was realised that at least one nmssm higgs boson should remain observable at the lhc over the nmssm parameter space that does not allow any higgs - to - higgs decay .",
    "however , when the only light non - singlet ( and , therefore , potentially visible ) cp - even higgs boson , @xmath20 or @xmath25 , decays mainly to two very light cp - odd higgs bosons , @xmath26 , one may not have a higgs signal of statistical significance at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in fact , further violations to the theorem may well occur if one enables higgs - to - susy decays ( e.g. , into neutralino pairs , yielding invisible higgs signals ) .",
    "while there is no definitive evidence on whether a ` no - lose theorem ' can be proved for the nmssm , we are here also concerned with an orthogonal approach .",
    "we asked ourselves if a , so to say , ` more - to - gain theorem ' can be formulated in the nmssm .",
    "that is , whether there exist regions of the nmssm parameter space where more and/or different higgs states of the nmssm are visible at the lhc than those available within the mssm . in our attempt to overview such a possibility",
    ", we consider here the case of the di - photon and @xmath1 decay channels of a light neutral higgs boson .",
    "the first mode can successfully be probed in the mssm , but limitedly to the case of the lightest cp - even higgs boson and for masses of order 100130 gev or so .",
    "we will show that in the nmssm there exist regions of its parameter space where one can potentially have a sizable di - photon signal from a higgs state of different nature ( cp - odd instead of cp - even ) and with much smaller mass ( down to 10 gev or so ) , owing in large part to an increased br@xmath27 .",
    "such a possibility emerges in the nmssm due to the fact that such a cp - odd higgs state has a predominant singlet component and a very weak doublet one . as a consequence ,",
    "all partial decay widths are heavily suppressed as they employ only the doublet component , except one : the @xmath2 partial decay width .",
    "this comes from the fact that the @xmath28 coupling is not suppressed , as it is generated through the @xmath29 lagrangian term and therefore implies no small mixing .",
    "although the direct decay @xmath0 @xmath30 @xmath31 is forbidden , the aforementioned coupling participates in the @xmath32 effective coupling .",
    "the @xmath1 channel is used in the mssm as a search channel of rather heavy and degenerate cp - even and cp - odd states and its exploitation has not been proved at very low masses , say , below @xmath33 .",
    "we will show here that the @xmath34-pair decay can be very relevant for such a mass interval , in the case of an @xmath0 state of the nmssm .",
    "the extraction of either channel for low higgs masses would then unmistakably point to the existence of non - minimal susy higgs sector .",
    "we build on the results presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where several such signals ( for rather heavy higgs states though ) were established in some ( complementary ) regions of the nmssm parameter space .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : scan ] we describe the parameter space scans performed in order to isolate the combinations of nmssm inputs that can give rise to the described phenomenology . in sec .",
    "[ sect : rates ] we discuss typical event rates , highlighting the relevance of higgs production in association with bottom quark pairs as most favourable production mode . in sec .",
    "[ sect : s2b ] we describe the signal - to - background analysis performed and introduce some benchmark points where an @xmath0 signal can be extracted ( albeit limitedly to the @xmath1 decay mode ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sect : summa ] we summarise and conclude .",
    "for a general study of the nmssm higgs sector , we used here the up - to - date publicly available fortran package nmssmtools developed in refs .",
    "@xcite2.3.1 . ] .",
    "this package computes the masses , couplings and decay widths of all the higgs bosons of the nmssm in terms of its parameters at the electro - weak ( ew ) scale .",
    "the nmssmtools also takes into account theoretical as well as experimental constraints from negative higgs searches at lep @xcite and the tevatron , along with the unconventional channels relevant for the nmssm .    for our purpose , instead of postulating unification , and without taking into account the susy breaking mechanism , we fixed the soft susy breaking terms to very high values , so that they have little or no contribution to the outputs of the parameter scans .",
    "consequently , we are left with the aforementioned six free parameters .",
    "our parameter space is in particular defined through the yukawa couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the soft trilinear terms @xmath10 and @xmath11 , plus tan@xmath35 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets ) and @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the vev of the higgs singlet ) . in our numerical analyses",
    "we have taken @xmath38 gev and @xmath39 gev for the bottom- and top - quark mass , respectively .",
    "we have used the nmhdecay code to scan over the nmssm parameter space defined through the six parameters already discussed taken in the following intervals :    @xmath8 : 0.0001  0.7 , @xmath9 : 0  0.65 , @xmath40 : 1.6  54 , + @xmath41 : 100  1000 gev , @xmath42 : @xmath431000  + 1000 gev , @xmath44 : @xmath4310  0 .",
    "+    ( notice that our aim is exploring the parameter space which has very low @xmath45 and one way to do that is by choosing @xmath11 small , in which case its negative value is preferred @xcite ) .",
    "remaining soft terms which are fixed in the scan include : + @xmath46 tev , + @xmath47 tev , + @xmath48 tev , + @xmath49 tev . +",
    "as intimated , we have fixed soft term parameters at the tev scale to minimise their contributions to parameter space outputs but changing values of some of those parameters such as @xmath50 could decrease or increase the number of successful points emerging from the nmssmtools scans but without a significant impact on the @xmath45 distribution . also , notice that the sfermion mass parameters and the @xmath51 gaugino mass parameter , @xmath52 , play crucial roles in constraining @xmath40 .",
    "lowering values of those parameters allow less values of @xmath40 to pass experimental and theoretical constraints , however , this is a less interesting region of the nmssm parameter space for our analysis , as our higgs production mode is only relevant at large values of this parameter . the effect of heavy gaugino mass parameters on the output of parameter space , in particular @xmath53 , would be small except for @xmath52 through its effect on @xmath54 .    in line with the assumptions made in @xcite , the allowed decay modes for neutral nmssm higgs bosons are to signify any of the neutral cp - even(odd ) higgs bosons of the nmssm .",
    "] : @xmath55 ( notice that for the cp - odd higgses , the decay into vector boson pairs is not allowed due to cp - conservation ) . here , ` higgses ' refers to any final state involving all possible combination of two higgs bosons ( neutral and/or charged ) or of one higgs boson and a gauge vector .",
    "we have performed our scan over 10 million of randomly selected points in the specified parameter space .",
    "the output , as stated earlier , contains masses , branching ratios ( brs ) and couplings of the nmssm higgses , for all the points which are not forbidden by the various experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "the points which violate the constraints are eliminated .",
    "the surviving data points are then used to determine the cross sections for nmssm higgs hadro - production by using calchep @xcite , the centre - of - mass energy at parton level , for all processes computed . ] , wherein some new modules have been implemented for this purpose @xcite .",
    "as the susy mass scale has been arbitrarily set well above the ew one ( see above ) , the nmssm higgs production modes exploitable in simulations at the lhc are those involving couplings to heavy ordinary matter only , i.e. , ( hereafter , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) for neutral higgs production ( where the last two channels are only allowed for cp - even higgs production ) : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 ( these are the so - called ` direct ' higgs production modes ) . here , ` higgs ' refers to any possible neutral higgs boson .",
    "we can however anticipate that , for the purpose of extracting an @xmath62 or @xmath63 resonance , only the second channel turns out to be useful and limitedly to the case @xmath64 .",
    "this is because the associated @xmath65 pairs can be ( vertex ) tagged , thus offering a useful handle for background rejection .",
    "the case @xmath66 in fact gives too small cross section .",
    "the gluon fusion channel is instead burdened by huge standard model ( sm ) backgrounds ( @xmath67 as well as jets mis - identified as photons in the @xmath2 mode and drell - yan and di - jet production in the @xmath1 channel ) .",
    "higgs - strahlung and vbf also suffer from large sm backgrounds , though their main drawback are rather smaller production rates in comparison ( as they are ew processes ) .",
    "+ in the nmssm , @xmath0 state is a composition of the usual doublet component of the cp - odd mssm higgs boson , @xmath68 , and the new singlet component , @xmath69 , coming from the singlet superfield of the nmssm .",
    "this can be written as @xcite : @xmath70 for very small values of @xmath71 , the lightest cp - odd higgs , @xmath0 , is mostly singlet - like with a tiny doublet component , i.e. the mixing angle @xmath72 is small , see top - pane of fig .",
    "1 , which shows the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath0 is highly singlet , @xmath73 , then br@xmath74 can reach unity as shown in the bottom - pane of this figure .",
    "+ to good approximation , @xmath45 can be written in the nmssm as @xcite : @xmath75 the first term of the this expression is dominant especially at large @xmath40 . also , it is clear that a combination of all tree level higgs sector parameters jointly affects @xmath45 in general .    as an initial step towards the analysis of the data , we have computed @xmath45 against each of the six tree level higgs sector parameters of the nmssm .",
    "2 presents the results of our scan , these series of plots illustrating the distribution of @xmath45 over the six parameters and as a function of br@xmath27 and br@xmath76 . in the parameter space adopted for this analysis",
    "we have noticed that the large @xmath40 and small @xmath77 ( and , to some extent , also @xmath8 ) region is the one most compatible with current theoretical and experimental constraints , though this conclusion should not be generalised to the entire parameter space .",
    "herein , it is also obvious that @xmath45 increases by increasing @xmath9 and @xmath78 whereas it decreases by increasing @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , from a closer look at fig .",
    "2 , it is clear that the br@xmath27 can be very large , indeed dominant , and @xmath45 values in the region 50 to 100 gev maximise that rate .",
    "also , notice that br@xmath76 reaches about 10% in most of the parameter space which has @xmath79 gev , in which case the @xmath0 decay into @xmath65 is open and dominant .",
    "yet also notice that there is a small region with very low @xmath45 values , @xmath80 gev , yielding a large br@xmath76 , greater than @xmath81 , as shown in the bottom - right corner of the bottom - right pane of this figure .",
    "the latter region occurs when @xmath82 is closed , in which case br@xmath76 is dominant compared to @xmath83 , @xmath84 , etc threshold is severely constrained , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) . ] .",
    "3 shows the distribution of event rates , @xmath85 and @xmath86 as functions of @xmath45 , br of the corresponding channel and @xmath40 .",
    "as expected , the inclusive cross section decreases with increasing @xmath45 , see the top two panes of this figure .",
    "although the br@xmath74 can be dominant over a sizable expanse of the nmssm parameter space ( middle - left pane ) , the latter does not correspond to the region that maximises the yield of @xmath85 , as the maximum of the latter occurs for brs in the region of a few @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , one can not take full advantage of the phenomenon described in the introduction , with respect to the singlet nature of the @xmath0 state entering the @xmath28 coupling , as the doublet component ( necessary to enable a large @xmath89 coupling at production level ) plays a stronger role in comparison .",
    "the tension between the two trends is such that the cross section times br rates are less than 100 fb .",
    "the outlook for the @xmath1 case is much brighter , as corresponding signal rates are at nb level for br@xmath90 or even 10 nb for br@xmath91 , see middle - right pane of fig .",
    "3 . also notice that such large rates naturally occur for any @xmath45 in the allowed interval ( see top - right pane of this figure ) .",
    "incidentally , notice in the case of both decay channels that not only the density of nmssm parameter configurations is larger as @xmath40 grows and values of the soft susy breaking parameters this would not necessarily hold . ] but also the event rates are maximal at large values of this parameter ( see bottom - left and bottom - right panes of fig .",
    "3 ) , thereby confirming what we intimated at the beginning of this section about the relevance of the @xmath92 production mode ( whose cross section is essentially proportional to @xmath93 ) .    in the nmssm",
    ", there is a large area of parameter space where one higgs state can decay into two , e.g. , @xmath94 : see fig .",
    "as it is clear from the left - pane of this figure , the majority of points generated here have @xmath95 gev and @xmath96 gev , thereby allowing the possibility of @xmath94 decays .",
    "moreover , this decay can be dominant and can reach unity as shown in the right - pane of this figure . despite this",
    ", such a decay may not give higgs signals with sufficient statistical significance at the lhc ( as discussed in previous literature and recalled here previously ) .",
    "therefore , we are here well motivated to look further at the scope of direct production of @xmath0 state in single mode at the lhc , through @xmath97 , over overlapping regions of nmssm parameter space , which we are going to do next .",
    "we perform here a partonic signal - to - background ( @xmath98 ) analysis , based on calchep , in the two channels @xmath2 and @xmath1 separately in the two forthcoming subsections .",
    "we assume @xmath99 tev throughout for the lhc energy and we will benchmark event rates on the basis of 300 inverse femtobarn of accumulated luminosity .    from the output of nmssmtools , we have chosen some points which have large ( yet not maximal ) event rates as illustrative examples to test the possibility of detecting @xmath0 with different masses at the lhc .",
    "they are located in large regions of parameter space with high density .",
    "these illustrative points are as follows :    * for @xmath45=9.8 gev : + @xmath8 = 0.22341 , @xmath9 = 0.41849 , tan@xmath35 = 53.82 , @xmath41 = 228.94 , @xmath10 = @xmath100 and @xmath11 = @xmath101 . * for @xmath45=20 gev : + @xmath8 = 0.07595 , @xmath9 = 0.11544 , tan@xmath35 = 51.51 , @xmath41 = 377.44 , @xmath10 = @xmath102 and @xmath11 = @xmath103 . * for @xmath45=31 gev : + @xmath8 = 0.10861 , @xmath9 = 0.46542 , tan@xmath35 = 48.06 , @xmath41 = 222.99 , @xmath10 = @xmath104 and @xmath11 = @xmath105 . * for @xmath45=46 gev : + @xmath8 = 0.14088 , @xmath9 = 0.25219 , tan@xmath35 = 50.56 , @xmath41 = 317.08 , @xmath10 = -@xmath106 and @xmath11 = @xmath107 . * for @xmath45=60.5 gev",

    ".      altogether , the fact that production cross section and br decay are maximised each in different regions of the nmssm parameter space makes it extremely difficult to obtain detectable event rates in this case .",
    "in fact , the signal yields for this channel are not only small in general , but also overwhelmed by the irreducible background .",
    "this is made explicit in figs .",
    "5 - 6 , which show how the signal , despite yielding sizable peaks in the di - photon invariant mass @xmath112 ( for example , for all @xmath45 masses considered  between @xmath113 and @xmath114 gev",
    " one can obtain some @xmath115 events every 300 fb@xmath116 , see top - left plot of each figure ) , is completely spoilt by the irreducible background , after using standard cuts refers to the pseudorapidity and @xmath117 to the cone distance expressed in differences of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle @xmath118 : i.e. , @xmath119 .",

    ":    @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123    in fact , for triggering purposes , at least one of the two photon transverse momenta ought to be increased to some 10 gev or so , which does not help to improve @xmath98 , as can be appreciated in the top - right and bottom plots in figs .",
    "5 - 6 , which show the average transverse momentum of a photon as well as its minimum and maximum , respectively . for @xmath0 masses above 50 gev or so the signal rates are ( in general ) too poor to even pass the observability threshold of 1 event after 300 fb@xmath116 .    in summary , despite the uniqueness of this signal , with the potential of clearly highlighting a possible singlet nature of the lightest cp - odd higgs of the nmssm , the latter is not extractable at the lhc .",
    "the situation is instead much rosier for the @xmath1 channel . after implementing the following standard cuts s to be on shell . ]",
    "@xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 we obtain the invariant masses of the @xmath1 system depicted in figs . 7 - 12 ( see their left - hand sides ) , where the signal clearly appears over the irreducible background due to @xmath127 .",
    "recalling that for low higgs masses , say below @xmath33 , in the @xmath128 channel , the dominant background is indeed the irreducible one , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , at least in the double- and single - leptonic channels , it is clear that there exist substantial discovery potential of a very light cp - odd higgs boson of the nmssm at the lhc .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we have also shown in figs .  7 - 12 the top - antitop reducible background , i.e. , @xmath129 ( with no cuts on @xmath130 though , which could always be enforced for its suppression ) , making it clear that discovery of heavier @xmath0 states in @xmath1 pairs , even in the the double- and single - leptonic channels , becomes much more difficult , although not impossible ( also owing to the long @xmath24 tail in the irreducible background ) .",
    "the case of fully hadronic decays is further contaminated by pure qcd backgrounds , the more so the smaller the @xmath45 values , so that we have not treated it here .",
    "finally notice the stability of the aforementioned signals against the possibility of stiffer thresholds in the selection of @xmath34 decays , as is made clear by the @xmath131 dependence of the @xmath7 and @xmath132 distributions in the right - hand side of figs .",
    "7 - 12 ( e.g. , an increase of even a factor of two in transverse momentum of the leptonic / hadronic @xmath34 decay products should not dramatically spoil the signal significances in the low @xmath0 mass region ) .",
    "overall , the @xmath1 signal yield in the low @xmath0 mass region is of order 3000 ( for @xmath45 reaching 80 gev or so ) to 30000 ( for @xmath45 starting at 10 gev or so ) signal events over a much smaller background , even assuming @xmath1 resolutions of 10 gev or so ( notice that the width of each histogram in the figures is of 1 gev and the plots are in log scale ) .",
    "in short , we have proven that there exist some regions of the nmssm parameter space where very light cp - odd higgs states , with a mixed singlet and doublet nature , could potentially be detected if @xmath133 in the @xmath134 mode if the cp - odd higgs state is produced in association with a @xmath65 pair . after a realistic @xmath98 analysis at parton level",
    ", we have in fact produced results showing that the extraction of light mass @xmath135 resonances above both the irreducible and ( dominant ) reducible backgrounds should be feasible using standard reconstruction techniques @xcite , at least in the double- and single - leptonic decay channels of the @xmath34 s .",
    "while more refined analyses , incorporating @xmath34-decay , parton shower , hadronisation and detector effects , are needed in order to delineate the true discovery potential of the lhc over the actual nmssm parameter space , we believe that our results are a step in the right direction to prove the existence of a ` more - to - gain theorem ' at the cern collider for the nmssm with respect to the mssm , as @xmath1 signals from such light higgs bosons are not possible in the latter scenario . finally , some of the parameter regions where the aforementioned signal can be detected overlap with those where @xmath136 decays",
    "could also be effective in extracting an @xmath0 signal , so that the process discussed here also offers an alternative handle to establish a ` no - lose theorem ' for the nmssm at the lhc .",
    "further notice that we have explored here the two regimes @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the former is where the @xmath63 decay rate dominates ( these are the points in the ` red island ' to the outermost right - hand side of the middle - right plot of fig .  3 ) , for which br@xmath139 , as the @xmath65 decay channel is closed .",

    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath2 decay mode is overwhelmed by backgrounds despite the fact that the branching ratio of this mode can reach unity when @xmath0 is a pure singlet .    </S>",
