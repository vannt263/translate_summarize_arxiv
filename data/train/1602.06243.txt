    "such a heterostructure of sriro@xmath3 was originally suggested as a potential 2d ti @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but later it was shown to be unstable against antiferromagnetic ordering , resulting in a trivial insulator @xcite . a recent experimental study on ir - based ( 111 )",
    "heterostructure is consistent with the predicted magnetic and trivial insulating state @xcite .",
    "thus , ti states still remain to be unveiled among the transition - metal oxide family .",

    "theoretical studies of this compound suggested that the strong hybridization between ru and o ions is responsible for this unique character @xcite .",

    "_ constructed a 2d model for srru@xmath0o@xmath1 and analyzed magnetic transitions @xcite .",
    "some of theoretical studies on srru@xmath0o@xmath1 have already introduced spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , but its topological nature has not been investigated . as far as we are aware , there is no experimental or theoretical report on caos@xmath0o@xmath1 . however , due to the close physical similarity between sr and ca and between ru and os , once synthesized properly , it would form the isostructure of srru@xmath0o@xmath1 .    using density functional theory ( dft ) , we investigate the topological property of srru@xmath0o@xmath1 and isostructural caos@xmath0o@xmath1 . both materials have the trivial band topology under ambient pressure . however , under a certain pressure or strain , band inversion is induced at one of the time - reversal - invariant momenta ( trim ) , resulting in a nontrivial band topology .",
    "this phase is characterized as a strong topological insulator ( sti ) with one dirac cone on each surface . while these materials have rather two - dimensional structure , the three - dimensionality is essential to drive the topological transition in srru@xmath0o@xmath1 and caos@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "the structural optimization was done using vasp @xcite with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite and projector augmented wave ( paw ) approach @xcite . for os and o standard potentials were used ( os and o in the vasp distribution ) , for ru a potential in which semicore @xmath8 states are treated as valence states was used ( ru@xmath9 ) , and for sr and ca potentials in which semicore @xmath10 and @xmath8 states are treated as valence states were used ( sr@xmath11 and ca@xmath11 ) .",
    "the structural optimization was done using the doubled unit cell with the experimental lattice constants , a @xmath12 @xmath13-point grid , and an energy cutoff of 600 ev . using the obtained structural data , we calculated the topological indices for the band structure using the parities of bloch wave functions obtained with the irrep program in the wien2k code @xcite . for this purpose , we turned on soc , set @xmath14 , and used a @xmath15 @xmath13-point grid .",

    "all calculations were done assuming the nonmagnetic solution unless noted .    here , we start from our preliminary calculations on srru@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we first performed the full structural optimization for this compound including lattice constants and fractional atomic coordinates without soc .",
    "then , we turned on soc to calculate the band dispersion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : srru2o6 ] ( a ) .",
    "we found that the parity eigenvalue at trim is @xmath18 at the @xmath19 and m ( @xmath20 ) points , and @xmath21 at the a and l ( @xmath20 ) points . at the a point with a small band gap , the",
    "nearly degenerate highest occupied states and the lowest unoccupied state have opposite parities : @xmath21 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "thus , if one can introduce band inversion between these states at the a point , we expect that a sti would be realized with @xmath22 indices @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "to test this idea , we considered several strains with or without structural optimizations , and found that the desired band inversion indeed occurs when the @xmath2 axis is reduced by 20% while the other lattice constants and fractional atomic coordinates are unchanged [ fig .",
    "[ fig : srru2o6 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "however , such a huge reduction of the @xmath2-axis length is not realistic and , moreover , once the relaxation of the @xmath24-plane lattice constant and fractional atomic coordinates is allowed , the band inversion is suppressed and the system remains a trivial insulator .",
    "the results on strained srru@xmath0o@xmath1 motivate us to study the isostructural caos@xmath0o@xmath1 , where the negative chemical pressure due to the smaller ionic radius of ca than sr and the larger soc on os than ru are expected to be helpful to stabilize sti states .",
    "another thing to note is that , whereas srru@xmath0o@xmath1 is unstable against the g - type antiferromagnetic ordering in dft calculation as is consistent with experiments , for caos@xmath0o@xmath1 , we find neither the antiferromagnetic nor the ferromagnetic solutions , which means that the nonmagnetic state is the most stable .",
    "this feature is due to a larger extent of the os @xmath25 orbital than that of the ru @xmath26 orbital . because the antiferromagnetic order in srru@xmath0o@xmath1 enlarges the band gap  @xcite ,",

    ", when uniaxial pressure is applied , a trivial insulating state is maintained as in srru@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    ", os @xmath16 orbitals split into @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and twofold degenerate @xmath35 orbitals by the crystal field .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath35 orbitals are decoupled along the @xmath19-a line as a consequence of the threefold rotational symmetry in the @xmath36 ( @xmath24 ) plane around an axis passing through ca atoms .",
    "we have found that the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied states at the a point are the bonding and antibonding states of the @xmath35 orbitals on two os sites in the unit cell , respectively , thus having different parities for the space inversion .",
    "when soc is turned on , it allows additional orbital mixing among the @xmath33 and @xmath35 orbitals , by which the direct band gap at the @xmath19 and a points is enlarged and reduced , respectively [ compare solid lines and short dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : caos2o6 ] ( a ) ] .",
    "thus , the band inversion at the a point is favored under pressure .",
    "if soc is absent , uniform strain would favor a semimetallic state instead with an electron pocket at the @xmath19 point and hole pockets at the a point as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : caos2o6 ] ( e ) .",
    "the situation observed here that the linear combination of os @xmath16 orbitals on different sites plays a crucial role in understanding the band structure and the realized physical properties reminds us of a recent molecular - orbital picture proposed to apply to srru@xmath0o@xmath1 for explaining its small magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "although our choice of the unit cell and the basis orbitals , @xmath16 orbitals on two os sites , is different from theirs , hexagonal molecular orbitals on six ru sites , it is interesting that the intersite hopping among the extended @xmath26 or @xmath25 orbitals is essential to realize the fascinating physics , topological properties , and magnetism in these materials .    to check the consistency between the parity eigenvalue analysis and the sti nature ,",
    "we have also examined the surface states .",
    "for this purpose , we constructed finite thick @xmath37 slabs with the open boundary condition along the @xmath2 direction and the periodic boundary condition along the @xmath24 directions with the wannier tight - binding parametrization .",
    "results for the dispersion relations are shown in fig .",

    "to summarize , we have performed a systematic study of the topological property of strained srru@xmath0o@xmath1 and isostructural caos@xmath0o@xmath1 . based on the parity eigenvalue analysis",
    ", it is anticipated that a sti is realized when one induces band inversion at the a point . for srru@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "this happens by applying rather unrealistic strain . on the other hand , for caos@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "our analysis shows that such a band inversion could be in principle induced by hydrostatic pressure .    _",
    "chemical stability _ : before closing , we would like to check the chemical stability of caos@xmath0o@xmath1 . for this purpose ,",
    "we compute the total energy per unit formula of caos@xmath0o@xmath1 @xmath39 and compare it with those of ca@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath40 with the orthorhombic weberite structure @xmath41 @xcite , cao with the rocksalt structure @xmath42 , oso@xmath0 with the rutile structure @xmath43 @xcite , oso@xmath44 with the monoclinic structure with the space group @xmath45 @xmath46@xcite , and an o@xmath0 dimer @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "these energies are computed after the structural optimization without tuning on the soc as mentioned earlier .",
    "we obtained @xmath48 then , the energy changes by the spontaneous segregation @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 and @xmath52 ev , respectively .",
    "since the both energy changes are positive , we expect that caos@xmath0o@xmath1 is stable at least against the above segregations .",
    "we note , however , that the energy changes by the chemical reactions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are negative ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ev , respectively ) , and thus caos@xmath0o@xmath1 can be fragile in the atmosphere . to prevent such chemical reactions",
    ", the surface treatment might be necessary .",
    "even if successful synthesis is achieved , an additional 10% compressive strain is needed to realize a sti state in caos@xmath0o@xmath1 . to realize such strain ,",
    "how large a pressure should one apply ? from the dft calculation , this is obtained as a stress tensor , whose diagonal components are given by 38.1 ev for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 components and 31.1 ev for the @xmath59 component . because of the hexagonal symmetry , the stress tensor is anisotropic , but the anisotropy is rather small under this large strain . from these values ,",
    "the required external pressure is estimated to be about 66  gpa .",
    "while this pressure is accessible by the current technology , it may not be easily utilized in a small laboratory .",
    "are there other systems with the srru@xmath0o@xmath1-type structure that could realize ti states ?",
    "one possibility would be to use mg and os .",
    "the smaller ionic radius of mg@xmath60 compared to ca@xmath60 would further enhance chemical pressure",
    ". however , synthesis of isostructural mgos@xmath0o@xmath1 could be even more difficult and one might need to rely on special techniques such as high - pressure synthesis or molecular beam epitaxy with an appropriate substrate .",
    "another possible route to realize stis with a similar structure would be to replace ru and os with other ions having the nominal 4@xmath61 or 5@xmath61 configuration .",
    "as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : surface ] ( a ) and [ fig : surface ] ( b ) , there appear dirac cones at the @xmath62 point connecting the highest and the second highest unoccupied continua irrespective of the strain . if these continua could be separated by some means , the second highest continuum will be fully filled and the highest one will be for the nominal @xmath61 configuration , resulting in a sti with one dirac cone on a surface . while we have yet to identify materials which become stis at ambient pressure , our approach using chemical and soc pressure would be useful for guiding materials exploration .",
