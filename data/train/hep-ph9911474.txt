    "present lattice qcd calculations can accomplish this task , and indeed the eos of the pure gluon plasma @xcite and of systems containing two or four light dynamical quark flavors @xcite are known reliably at finite temperature , and simulations with physical quark masses will possibly be available in the future .    as a matter of fact",

    "iv the quark - gluon plasma is considered with the massive strangeness degree of freedom appropriately taken into account . despite of two free model parameters ( which can be fixed when lattice data for the physical ( 2 + 1 ) flavor system will be available ) , our approach makes some definite statements about the eos of the quark - gluon plasma .",

    "finally , a summary and an outlook are given in sec .",
    "the concept of describing an interacting system in terms of a system of quasiparticles which , as appropriate ground states , reflect relevant aspects of the interaction by effective properties , is successfully used in many fields of physics . for deconfined qcd plasmas , the development of the quasiparticle idea , starting with @xcite , ran parallel to the improvement of the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "these nonperturbative numerical simulations provide the testing ground for the quasiparticle concept which is a phenomenological approach . at the same time , by identifying the quasiparticles with the asymptotically relevant excitations @xcite , these models yield a physically intuitive picture of the strongly interacting system . referring to @xcite for a recent survey of quasiparticle descriptions of finite - temperature lattice data , we focus in this work on the generalization of the approach to non - zero chemical potential .",
    "we consider an @xmath13 plasma of gluons , with @xmath14 for qcd , and @xmath15 quark flavors in thermodynamic equilibrium . within the approach outlined below",
    ", the interacting plasma is described as a system of massive quasiparticles , a picture arising asymptotically from the in - medium properties of the constituents of the plasma . for thermal momenta @xmath16 ,",
    "the relevant modes , transversal gluons and quark - particle excitations , propagate predominantly on - shell with dispersion relations @xmath17 and @xmath18 while the plasmon ( longitudinal gluon ) and plasmino ( quark - hole ) states are essentially unpopulated @xcite .",
    "neglecting sub - leading effects , the medium contributions @xmath19 are the leading order on - shell selfenergies . depending on the coupling @xmath20 , the temperature and chemical potential as well as the rest mass @xmath21 ( the latter vanishing for gluons ) ,",

    "is related to the quasiparticle masses , @xmath30 we remark that the stationarity of the quasiparticle pressure leads , by the feynman - hellmann relation , to a chiral condensate @xmath31 , so the restoration of chiral symmetry of massless quark flavors in the deconfined phase is inherent in the approach . furthermore",
    ", the stationarity implies that the entropy and the particle densities are given by the sum of the quasiparticle contributions , @xmath32 this quasiparticle approach reproduces the leading - order perturbative results for arbitrary values of @xmath33 and @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , however , it represents a thermodynamically consistent effective resummation of the leading - order thermal contributions @xcite . as a nonperturbative approach , hence",
    ", it can be expected to be more appropriate in the large - coupling regime than perturbative predictions which , as truncated power expansions , fail to be reliable there .",
    "more specifically , the effective quasiparticle description will be an appropriate framework as long as the spectral properties of the relevant excitations do not differ qualitatively from their asymptotic form .",
    "since propagating constituents in a plasma are , on general grounds , expected to possess a spectral representation with the strength predominately accumulated in a quasiparticle peak , our approach may be anticipated to be reasonable even close to the confinement transition . in a way , this expectation has some support from the hot @xmath34 theory where the selfconsistent resummation of superdaisy graphs leads to a similar ` strict - quasiparticle ' picture @xcite as introduced above for qcd . by resumming the propagator beyond the leading - loop order , then , the quasiparticle properties were shown to be pronounced even for larger values of the coupling @xcite . in a more direct way",
    ", the quasiparticle approach can be tested by comparison to the lattice data available for several qcd - model systems at finite temperature .      to obtain the eos as a function of the temperature",

    ", the quasiparticle model is applied to the case of the pure su(3 ) gauge plasma .",
    "recently , new lattice results calculated with a renormalization - improved action have been published @xcite , which are similar but by some 3 @xmath40 4% larger than the data @xcite obtained with a standard action .",
    "consequently , the parameters fitting both data sets , as shown in tab .  1 , differ notably only in the number @xmath41 of the gluon quasiparticle degrees of freedom .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is introduced here as fit parameter to account , on one hand , for possible finite size effects of the lattice data and , on the other hand , for residual sub - leading effects otherwise neglected in the quasiparticle ansatz . as expected , for both data sets the values of @xmath41 are close to @xmath42 . as shown in fig .",

    "the next case analyzed is the system with two light quark flavors , with an estimate for the continuum extrapolation of the pressure given in @xcite . to calculate the quasiparticle pressure ( [ p_eff ] ) for fixed values of the parameters ,",
    "the interaction pressure @xmath24 is required as a function of the temperature .",
    "it can be obtained by the relation ( [ stat ] ) , with an integration constant @xmath43 adjusted to the lattice data , e.g. , at the smallest temperature .",
    "the resulting agreement of the data and the model , with the parameters given in tab .  1 ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nf2 ] .",
    "note that the quark quasiparticle degeneracy is held fixed to @xmath44 , as in the next example .",
    "the available lattice data @xcite for the system with @xmath45 light flavors were obtained by the extrapolation to the chiral limit of lattice simulations of quarks with a ratio of mass to temperature of 0.2 and 0.4 .",
    "being compatible with each other , both data sets are reproduced by a single set of model parameters as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nf4 ] .",
    "so far , however , the data are not yet continuum extrapolated .",
    "accordingly , the quasiparticle degeneracies are considerably larger than in the previous cases ( cf .",
    "tab .  1 ) .",
    "thus it is suggesting to interpret , to a large amount , the fit value of @xmath46 to be due to finite size effects which , in the free limit , are indeed found to have the same order of magnitude . concerning the function",
    "@xmath47 we mention that it turns out positive in the interval @xmath48 , and negative and small at larger values of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with two remarks .",
    "as anticipated , the quasiparticle approach ( being tested with available lattice data ) is an appropriate description even close to the confinement transition .",
    "this provides some confidence in the applicability , in the nonperturbative regime , of the phenomenological quasiparticle resummation with the effects of finite spectral widths parameterized in an effective coupling .",
    "the quasiparticle approach is also supported by the more formal development of the thermodynamical resummation of hard - thermal loops , proposed in @xcite to improve the bare perturbation theory .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the entropy of the plasma is dominated by the asymptotic behavior of those excitations which we start with as the relevant quasiparticles . moreover , a direct hard - thermal - loop resummation of the pressure within the luttinger - ward formalism results in an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ p_eff ] ) , with @xmath24 corresponding in part to the so - called @xmath49 functional , as the quasiparticle entropy eq .",
    "( [ s , n ] ) is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "this feature , related to the underlying one - loop structure of the selfenergies in both cases , makes the entropy an interesting quantity , whereas the pressure contains the full thermodynamical information . ] @xcite .",
    "while this resummation , being more rigorous from a theoretical point of view and containing no fit parameters , reproduces the lattice data already qualitatively , we focus here on a phenomenological description , adjustable quantitatively to data .",
    "nevertheless , the hard - thermal - loop resummation approaches yield further confidence to the quasiparticle model , also with regard to the extension to finite chemical potential as outlined subsequently .",
    "encouraged by the successful quasiparticle description of the @xmath12 lattice data , the model is now applied to finite chemical potential .",
    "this extension requires no further assumptions and allows in a straightforward way to map the eos at finite temperature and @xmath12 into the @xmath50 plane .",
    "this continuous mapping relying on quark and gluon quasiparticles , however , can not provide information about other possible phases with a different ( quasiparticle ) structure , so the following consideration apply only to ` conventional ' deconfined matter .    in general , the pressure is a potential of the state variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as a direct consequence thereof",

    "( [ stat ] ) . with @xmath19 depending on @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) represents a flow equation for the effective coupling , following directly from principles of thermodynamics .",
    "this flow equation is a quasilinear partial differential equation of the form @xmath52 with the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 depending on @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is instructive to consider first the asymptotic limit , where @xmath55 and eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) reduces to the homogeneous form @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "this equation has solutions @xmath58 along the characteristics given by @xmath59 as a result of this elliptic flow , the renormalization scale @xmath38 of @xmath60 determines the scale @xmath61 of the @xmath2 dependent running coupling @xmath62 .",
    "the flow of the effective coupling is elliptic also in the nonperturbative regime , thus mapping the @xmath12 axis , where @xmath20 can be determined from lattice data , into the @xmath50 plane . as a representative example",
    ", the nonperturbative flow of the coupling of the @xmath45 system is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nf4flow ] .",
    "as to be expected , the characteristics emanating at @xmath12 in the deconfined phase do not attach a certain region , at small values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , of the phase diagram which is obviously related to the confinement phase .",
    "it is noted that at @xmath63 and small temperatures , indicated by intersecting characteristics , the solution of the flow equation is not unique .",
    "this ostensible ambiguity is , however , of no physical consequence , i.e. , the approach is intrinsically consistent , since already outside that region the quasiparticle pressure ( calculated along the characteristics ) would become negative .",
    "this region of absolute thermodynamical instability , on the other hand , may be considered as an indication of a transition to a different phase , in fact already at some positive pressure . whether this is the confined phase or , maybe already at such small chemical potential , a color - superconducting state ( cf .",
    "@xcite and further references therein ) remains , of course , a speculation within the present phenomenological approach . in any case , the pressure ( see fig .  [",
    "f : nf4p ] ) increases much slower with @xmath2 than with @xmath1 , which makes the transition to another deconfined phase likely in that region .",
    "this behavior is mainly attributed to the fact that the effective coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ f : nf4alph ] ) , as a function of increasing chemical potential , approaches the asymptotic limit more slowly than in the direction of increasing temperature .    to conclude this example",
    ", we remark that the proposed extension of the lattice eos to finite chemical potential , though model - dependent in using a quasiparticle picture to derive the flow equation ( [ flow ] ) , is based on _ ab initio _ calculable data .",
    "since the model works perfectly at @xmath12 and , on the other hand , the convergence problem of perturbation theory and the concept to overcome it by resummation are not specific to @xmath12 , we expect our extension of the data as reliable , at least semi - quantitatively .",
    "similar flow equations can also be derived in more rigorous approaches , and on general grounds they are expected to be also of elliptic type . in this sense , the eos at @xmath12 ` knows ' about @xmath64 . nevertheless ,",
    "as already mentioned , such continuous extensions do not access other possible qcd - phases with a different ground state ; the actual eos of strongly interacting matter is rather determined by thermodynamical stability between ` competing ' phases .",
    "although lattice simulations of the physically interesting case of two light and one medium - mass flavor are in progress @xcite , reliable data of the thermodynamics of qcd with physical quark current masses , i.e.  with @xmath65 mev for the strange flavor , are still lacking to fix the quasiparticle parameters at @xmath12 . nevertheless , even when freely varying the parameters over large ranges , our model allows some predictions since the parameter dependence of the quasiparticle pressure @xmath66 is weak due to the stationarity property eq .",

    "the eos for a representative choice of the parameters is provided in tabular form in @xcite for the plasma with vanishing net - strangeness , i.e.  with the quark chemical potentials @xmath77 and @xmath78 . with the effective coupling decreasing only logarithmically from @xmath79 at small values of the temperature and the chemical potential , the medium contributions ( [ pi ] ) to the quasiparticle masses",
    "are large , of the order of @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",

[ f:(2 + 1)eos ] for several values of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath73 .",
    "already at temperatures slightly above @xmath75 , the scaled energy density reaches a saturation - like behavior at about 90% of the asymptotic limit .",

    "compact quark stars with a larger mass can only exist for values of @xmath100mev , depending only marginally on @xmath96 .",
    "we hence conclude that compact stars with masses @xmath101 and radii @xmath102 km are unlikely to be composed mainly of deconfined matter in @xmath0-equilibrium , irrespective of the uncertainty of the model parameters of our approach .",
    "in summary we have generalized a thermodynamic quasiparticle description of deconfined matter to finite chemical potential @xmath2 not yet accessible by present lattice calculations .",
    "of central importance to the model is the effective coupling @xmath103 which can be obtained at @xmath12 from available lattice data , proving at the same time the applicability of the quasiparticle picture even close to the confinement transition . at @xmath104 , @xmath20",

    "an important consequence of the quasiparticle approach is the relation of the ` critical ' values of temperature and chemical potential . for deconfinement matter with physical quark masses",
    ", this fact leads to the implication that pure quark stars are less massive and , hence , more distinct in the bulk properties to neutron stars than estimated by other approaches with an _ ad hoc _ choice of small values of the bag constant .",
    "further applications of the quasiparticle model , in connection with realistic thermodynamical descriptions of other qcd phases , is desirable . in particular , in the cold and dense regime where a color - superconducting state is expected to be important , the quasiparticle eos can provide one part of the information about the phase boundary .",

    "is required .",
    "since the results of the quasiparticle model differ considerably from that of simpler approaches as the bag model ( e.g. , in the reduced latent heat and the saturation - like behavior of the energy density at about 90% of the free limit ) , dynamical effects of a realistic eos may even lead to observable signals of the experimental formation of the quark - gluon plasma .",
