    "the space - time , together with its metric , is of class @xmath1 , except possibly on 3-surfaces of discontinuity , where the second derivatives of the metric are allowed to have jump discontinuities .",
    "the somewhat odd looking regularity assumption is borrowed from lichnerowicz  @xcite .",
    "it is meant to allow such discontinuities as one expects to find at the interface between two different materials , but nothing worse .",
    "the areal radius  @xmath2 is defined by the requirement that the area of a sphere be @xmath3 . in terms of the radius  @xmath2 and metric tensor  @xmath4",
    ", we may then define the hawking mass  @xmath5 by the relation @xmath6 the purpose of this paper is to prove sharp bounds on the ratio @xmath7 under various hypotheses on the eigenvalues of the einstein tensor .",
    "the particular hypotheses considered , their history and the resulting bounds are discussed in section  [ matter ] .",
    "three general comments should be made at this stage .",
    "first , the method employed is quite general and can be used to obtain sharp bounds on @xmath7 for any matter model , not just those described below .",
    "second , obtaining sharp bounds is , in each case , relatively easy . proving sharpness , while not conceptually difficult , requires considerably more effort .",
    "third , we carefully avoid the assumption , made tacitly by previous authors , that @xmath8 .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "section  [ coordinates ] is devoted to a discussion of coordinates and the components of the einstein tensor in our chosen coordinate system .",
    "section  [ matter ] introduces the various assumptions on this tensor which are needed for the statement of our theorem .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ main ] , appears in section  [ omr ] , while its proof is given in section  [ pro ] .",
    "a space - time of the class considered above has coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , known as _ curvature coordinates _ , in which the metric takes the form @xmath12 here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are functions of @xmath2 .",
    "as shown in synge  @xcite , the einstein tensor in curvature coordinates is of the form @xmath15 here , primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath2 , while the off - diagonal entries are all zero .",
    "the formulae become a bit cleaner when one uses derivatives with respect to @xmath16 instead . denoting such derivatives by dots ,",
    "one obtains the equivalent system @xmath17 the corresponding einstein tensor , given by einstein s field equations , has diagonal entries @xmath18 and all off - diagonal entries equal to zero . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are interpreted as the radial and tangential pressures , respectively , while @xmath21 is interpreted as the energy density .",
    "there are two annoying points about curvature coordinates .",
    "* the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 may be of lower regularity than the metric , since @xmath2 itself is of lower regularity than the metric .",
    "this is discussed in more detail by israel  @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to note that regularity is , in the presence of the other assumptions , equivalent to the statement that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath1 functions of  @xmath2 , except possibly at certain points , where the radial pressure  @xmath19 is continuous and the tangential pressure  @xmath20 and energy density @xmath21 are allowed to have jump discontinuities . at @xmath24 ,",
    "the correct condition is that @xmath25 . * the coordinates may fail to cover the whole space - time .",
    "in fact , they cover the region from the time axis out to the first marginally trapped sphere , _ i.e. _ , the first sphere where @xmath26 .",
    "if we were to assume , as most authors do , that curvature coordinates cover the whole space - time , then we would , in effect , be making the very strong additional assumption that @xmath27 everywhere .",
    "this we wish to avoid . for the classes of space - times we consider it is , in fact , the case that @xmath28 everywhere , but this belongs to the conclusion of our theorem , not to its hypotheses . + the simplest example of a space - time that satisfies our spherical symmetry , staticity and regularity assumptions but has a marginally trapped surface is de sitter space , for which @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", the coordinates cover a region where @xmath30 but break down at the boundary . outside this region",
    ", there is another which is isometric to the first , and it is easy to check that @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "however , de sitter space does not satisfy the hypotheses of our theorem because it has negative pressures everywhere .",
    "various conditions on the three functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of interest :    * _ non - negative isotropic pressure : _ for fluids , one expects @xmath33 .",
    "the sharp bound @xmath34 under this assumption , and no others , was derived by bondi  @xcite .",
    "his method of proof is closely related to ours but is not rigorous . *",
    "_ buchdahl assumption : _ for static stars with constant density , one has the bound @xmath35 derived by buchdahl @xcite .",
    "more generally , this bound holds when @xmath36 , as long as @xmath37 is decreasing ; see @xcite .",
    "the isotropy assumption was relaxed in @xcite , where the case @xmath38 was treated , still the monotonicity assumption remains crucial .",
    "* _ dominant energy condition : _ for almost any reasonable matter model , one expects @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the special case that @xmath41 , the bound @xmath42 is provided by @xcite .",
    "our bound for this special case is roughly @xmath43 , which we show to be sharp . *",
    "vlasov - einstein : _ for vlasov - einstein matter , the stress energy tensor is an integral of those of individual particles , each of which has rank one and satisfies the dominant energy condition .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . under these assumptions ,",
    "andrasson @xcite has recently shown that the sharp is proved only within the class of space - times satisfying the pressure conditions above , without considering whether such space - times arise from solutions of the full vlasov - einstein system .",
    "andrasson s argument , on the other hand , does provide solutions to the full system .",
    "] bound is @xmath47 our method provides a new , and considerably shorter , proof of this result .",
    "* _ zero radial pressure : _ the case @xmath48 was studied by florides  @xcite who obtained the sharp bound @xmath49 this can also be proved using our method , but the resulting proof is neither shorter nor clearer than the original , so we do not consider this case further .",
    "[ main ] consider a space - time satisfying the regularity , staticity and spherical symmetry conditions described in the introduction .",
    "suppose that the corresponding hawking mass is finite and that the pressures @xmath50 and energy density @xmath21 are all non - negative .",

    "these can be described in terms of a system of odes which arises in the course of the proof ; see .",
    "the values given here are accurate up to three decimal places .",
    "there is no assumption on the behavior of the space - time as @xmath2 tends to infinity .",
    "in fact , we do not even assume that @xmath2 is unbounded .",
    "this point is crucial .",
    "it allows us to apply the theorem to the interior of a finite sphere and , in particular , to the interior of the first marginally trapped surface , if there is such a surface .",
    "more precisely , suppose we can prove the theorem in the region where the curvature coordinates are defined , namely in the region where @xmath8 .",
    "for each matter model , we may then deduce that @xmath61 for some constant @xmath62 which depends on the matter model considered . since @xmath63 is continuous and our space - time",
    "is connected , this actually implies that @xmath64 throughout the space - time . in other words ,",
    "the marginally trapped surface that we allowed is not , in fact present , and the curvature coordinates , which might _ a priori _ have covered only part of the space - time , cover the whole space - time .",
    "we therefore obtain the full theorem from the special case where the whole space - time is covered by curvature coordinates . in particular , we may , and do , use curvature coordinates throughout the proof without further comment .",
    "our proof for the isotropic case @xmath65 applies verbatim in the more general case @xmath66 , while the estimates are sharp for that case as well .",
    "the _ assumptions _ of theorem [ main ] can be slightly improved in the sense that we do not use our hypothesis @xmath67 to establish the given estimates .",
    "this hypothesis is merely included to improve the _ conclusions _ of theorem [ main ] , as sharpness is now shown over a smaller class of space - times .",
    "in fact , the examples we construct in order to prove sharpness belong to the even smaller class of space - times which are vacuum outside a sphere .    the proof of theorem [ main ] is based on the following elementary fact , which is essentially due to bondi @xcite .",
    "[ cur ] let the assumptions of theorem [ main ] hold . then the variables @xmath68 give rise to a parametric curve which lies in @xmath69 and satisfies the equations @xmath70 where the dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath71 .",

    "next , we use to get @xmath77 to establish our assertion , we combine , and to find that @xmath78 to establish our remaining assertion , we first use and to get @xmath79 solving the leftmost equation for @xmath80 and differentiating , we conclude that @xmath81 on the other hand , equations , and combine to give @xmath82 using these facts and a simple computation , one may thus easily deduce .",
    "to prove the desired estimates , we study the curve provided by lemma [ cur ] . in each case , we are seeking an upper bound for @xmath83 and also an upper bound for @xmath84 where the exact value of @xmath85 varies from case to case .",

    "let us also recall that @xmath89 throughout the curve , a fact we shall frequently need to use in what follows .      in this case , we are assuming that @xmath90 . according to lemma [ cur ] , the corresponding curve must thus satisfy @xmath91 combining the last equation with our computation , we now find @xmath92 \\\\ & \\leq -\\frac{4 - 3x+y}{2(1-x)^2 } \\cdot z_3(x , y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath93 is decreasing whenever @xmath94 , so it must be the case that @xmath95 throughout the curve .",
    "this proves the first inequality in , which also implies the second inequality because the maximum value of @xmath96 over the region @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 is attained at @xmath100 , namely at the point at which the curve @xmath101 intersects the @xmath96-axis .",
    "we refer the reader to fig . 1 for a sketch of the curves @xmath102 and @xmath101 .",
