    "under the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario , galaxy interactions play a key role in the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the nonlinear nature of the galaxy interactions , theoretical studies mostly rely on @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulations often adopt isolated galaxy models .",
    "galaxy models in many galaxy interaction simulations include dark matter halo , gas disk , stellar disk , and stellar bulge @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , generating an isolated stable galaxy model is not trivial procedure .",
    "it is required to solve complicated orbit integrations to make stable stellar systems @xcite .",
    "the interactions among the different components significantly modify the very initial setups @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is needed to satisfy the initially hydrostatic condition of the gas components . in order to isolate the galaxy interaction effects",
    ", it is necessary to carefully build the initial galaxy model and understand the evolution of the initial conditions , if there are any .",
    "however , the basic steps to construct various types of initial galaxy models are often omitted or discussed shortly .",
    "the detailed comparison studies of the evolution of different galaxy models in isolation are also not found sufficiently in the literature .",
    "moreover , it has been reported that some spiral galaxies like our own milky way as well as elliptical galaxies possess hot diffuse gas in the halo .",
    "importance of hot halo gas in the evolution of galaxies has been also evidenced by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who studied the effects of galaxy interactions on galaxy properties such as morphology , color , and star formation activity among others at various environment and redshifts .",
    "it has been consistently suggested by these studies that the hydrodynamic interaction between galaxies through exchange of cold gas and/or impact of hot halo gas makes a crucial role in the evolution of galaxy color and star formation activity .",
    "however , only a few numerical studies taking account of halo gas in the models have been presented .",
    "recently , @xcite performed hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers of disk galaxies , including for the first time a gradually cooling hot gas halo in their galaxy models .",
    "they studied the impact of a gaseous halo and galactic winds on the star formation activity during mergers and found that the gas halo component strongly affects the kinematics and internal structure of the merger remnants as well as the star formation history on the course of the merger . in a follow - up study @xcite",
    ", they also investigated the role of a hot gas component on disk thickening during minor merger and showed the dependency of the final scale height on the mass of the hot halo , the efficiency of the winds , and the merger mass ratio .",
    "they found that the cooling of the hot gaseous halo regenerates the thin disk , so that the remnants of 1:10 mergers exhibit a newly formed thin disk .",
    "these findings suggest that the existence of a hot gaseous halo significantly affects the results of galaxy interactions .",
    "it may be necessary to reinterpret many previous galactic scale simulation results that did not consider a hot gaseous halo .    in this paper , we present detailed descriptions of the various choices of the isolated milky way - like galaxy models .",
    "we also study the effects of the gas halo component with different properties , such as the cumulative mass profile , total mass , and rotation of the gas halo on their evolution .",
    "this paper is the first in a series of the galaxy interaction study that includes a hot gas halo in the initial galaxy model with a hope to explain the observational studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recent galaxy formation studies suggest that the galactic outflow is an essential mechanism for balance between gas accretion and galaxy growth ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it also regulates the star formation rate of galaxies . in our study",
    ", we also include galactic outflow driven by supernovae with different wind parameters to study the effects of a gas halo and galactic winds on the evolution of isolated galaxies .    in sec .  2",
    ", we give a brief account of the zeno software package and explain our galaxy models and their initial parameters .",

    "zeno allows one to build multiple spherical and disk components in mutual equilibrium with user - specified density profiles in collisionless or gaseous form , that fulfills our needs for constructing various galaxy models .",
    "we use about a dozen programs in the zeno package to complete our multi - component galaxy models .",
    "the procedure of constructing the models using those programs is described in appendix  a in detail .",
    "the zeno programs use dimensionless units with newton s constant @xmath1 = 1 .",

    "the gas halo of the models of subtype  dhi ( models  dhi , dhi - f5 , and dhir ) and model  hi follows the isothermal profile , and that of subtype  dhn ( models  dhn and dhn - f5 ) follows the nfw profile .",
    "we also try two distinct values of halo gas fraction @xmath85 ( table  1 ) , in order to examine how galaxy models with different amounts of hot gas evolve differently . in one case ,",
    "the halo gas fraction in models  dhi , dhir , dhn , and hi ( without ` -f5 ' in the model names ) is chosen to be @xmath86 , which corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "this mass of a gaseous halo is motivated from anderson & bregman ( 2010 ) where the upper limit of the hot halo mass of the milky way galaxy is estimated to be @xmath88 from the observed dispersion measure of pulsars in the large magellanic cloud , assuming an nfw profile for the hot gas . in the other case , in models  dhi - f5 and dhn - f5 , a more massive gas halo with @xmath89",

    "the more massive gas halo is motivated from @xcite . in their model with the maximum hot gas fraction , the mass of the gas halo within the virial radius is @xmath91 , such that the baryonic fraction within the virial radius has the universal value .",
    "the gas fraction in the disk is chosen to be a single value of @xmath92 = 0.12 and thus @xmath93 in all models possessing a gas disk .",

    "hence , the mass of the hot gas initialized in the halo is twice that of the cold gas in the disk . in terms of gas fractions in the disk and the halo , @xmath107 and @xmath86 as indicated in table  1 .",
    "the number of star or gas particles set in each component is @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the number of gas particles in the halo is twice of that in the disk , making the same mass per gas particle in the system .",
    "the particle mass is different for different components .",
    "to minimize the effects of the mass difference of simulation particles we set @xmath113 to be equal for particles in each component , where @xmath114 is the maximum acceleration experienced by a particle .",
    "we choose the gravitational softening length for the dm halo particles to @xmath71 = 1  kpc ( in all models ; table  2 ) . then the smoothing lengths for the gas , disk star , and bulge particles are determined to be 0.225 , 0.609 , and 0.410  kpc , respectively .",

    "therefore , we establish a simple criterion , shown by the black line in the @xmath126-@xmath127 plane , to determine if a gas particle at a certain time should be considered as the disk or the halo particle .",

    "this model is intended to have a more massive gas halo than that of the fiducial model  dhi , with the other properties in common ( tables  1 and 2 ; to keep the total mass of the dm + gas halo the same , the dm halo of model  dhi - f5 is set to be lighter than that of model  dhi by the mass difference in the gas halos ) .",
    "specifically , the gas halo of this model follows the same truncated isothermal density profile of eq .  3 as in the fiducial model with the common values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but is five times more in mass @xmath130 as well as in the number of particles @xmath74 .",

    "model  dhir is designed to examine how the rotation of the gas halo makes a difference in the evolution .",
    "thus the only difference between model  dhir and the fiducial model  dhi is whether the gas halo is spinning with non - zero initial velocities ( in model  dhir ) or stationary at the beginning .",
    "model  dhir shares all parameter values of all components given in table  2 with the fiducial model .",
    "the initial distribution of the particles and some basic profiles are presented in figs  1 and 2 , which are common to both models dhir and dhi except the tangential velocity profile of the gas halo as designed ( bottom - left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the tangential velocities of the hot gas in model  dhir are assigned in such a way that the rotation curve of the gas halo has the same shape but has half the amplitude of that of the gas disk .",
    "the vertical velocity @xmath132 is set to zero in this model .",
    "the choice of the gas halo rotation is not yet strongly restricted by current observations .",
    "for example , @xcite chose to set the spin of a gas halo in such a way that the specific angular momentum of the gas halo is four times that of the dm halo ( see sec .  2 of their paper for details ) .",
    "the test of different gas halo rotations would be the subject of future research .      as one of the dh type models ,",
    "model dhn consists of the five components of both star and gas disks , both dm and gas halos , and a bulge .",
    "differently from the fiducial model  dhi , the gas halo of this model follows the nfw profile instead of the isothermal profile ( tables  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the initial total mass of the gas halo is the same as that of the fiducial model .",

    "the star formation decreases afterwards because the cold and dense gas becomes less available as they are continually consumed by star formation ( refer to table  4 ) . in run  hi , where the initial galaxy model has only a hot gas halo , the sfr is zero during the entire run .",
    "the sfrs in the runs of type  dh models without winds ( top to fifth panels in the left column ) , where the galaxy models are initialized with both gas disk and gas halo , come out quite differently from that of run  d without a gas halo . in the fiducial run  dhi",

    "the sfr in run  dhi - f5 increases steeply to the maximum rate 2.658 @xmath171 at 1.48  gyr and decreases later to 0.9 @xmath171 at the end of the run .",
    "the maximum rate is about three times greater than that in the fiducial run .",
    "the time when the rate reaches its maximum is affected by the adopted value of the model parameter for star formation time - scale @xmath148 = 1.47  gyr .",
    "star formation occurs mostly in the gas originally set as the gas disk and only a few percent of the stars are formed out of the initially halo gas ( table  4 ) .",

    "as listed in table  4 , the number of stars generated from the gas initially set as the gas disk is smaller than that in the fiducial run at each time ; the number of new stars from the gas originally from the gas halo is a few times larger , however their total mass is still insignificant as @xmath174 1% of the total mass of all new stars .",
    "it is implied that the rotation of the gas halo in this run helps some halo gas particles to be accreted down to the gas disk more easily , however , it affects overall to lower star formation activity than in the run without the initial rotation .    in run  dhn ( with a nfw gas halo of @xmath172=0.01 )",

    "motivated by the existence of hot gaseous halo in spiral galaxies evidenced by both observations and simulations , we have investigated the effects of a gas halo on the evolution of isolated milky way - like galaxies using @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we have also examined the effects of galactic winds driven by supernovae on the evolution .    to generate the initial galaxy models",
    ", we used the zeno software package .",
    "we built seven different galaxy models , with or without a gas halo component with varying mass and density profile for comparison ( tables  1 and 2 ) : we tried two different density profiles for the gas halo - an isothermal profile and an nfw profile .",
    "we also tested different amounts of the halo gas fraction - @xmath167 = 0.01 and @xmath167 = 0.05 .",
    "in addition , we studied a case with an initially rotating gas halo .",
    "we set the disk gas fraction @xmath175 = 0.12 equally in all models possessing a gas disk .    each galaxy model",
    "was then evolved in isolation using the @xmath0-body / sph code gadget-3 ( an early version ) , first without including stellar winds driven by star formation .",
    "the effects of winds are also studied . in the wind test runs , either axial winds or isotropic winds",
    "were tested , with the wind efficiency of either @xmath138 = 2 or @xmath138 = 1 .",
    "we showed that the effects of the hot gas component on the evolution are significant , particularly in the gas disk dissipation / accretion and in the star formation activity .",
    "the runs with a gas halo show higher sfrs in the middle to last phase of the 3  gyr - simulations than in the run without a gas halo where the sfr reaches its maximum at the early phase and then decreases continuously thereafter .",
    "the star formation activity in the disks is affected by both the mass concentration at the inner part and the total mass of the gas halo .",
    "the more centrally concentrated nfw gas halo leads higher sfrs than in runs with the isothermal gas halo of the same total mass . in runs where the gas halo has higher density at the central halo and/or greater total mass , the sfrs are higher than others and the gas disks dissipate too quickly .",
    "the gas accretion from the halo onto the disk in those runs turns out to occur not much actively , and some portion of the accreted gas are quickly consumed by star formation as well , resulting in unrealistically small gas disks after a few gyr .",
    "it is not clear which physical processes are mainly responsible for the dissipation of gas disks .",
    "models  dhi ( the fidicial model ) and dhir ( with the additional rotation of the gas halo to the fiducial model ) show relatively reasonable results in both the gas dissipation and the star formation activity .",
    "the sfr in run  dhi is a bit higher than that in run  dhir in the middle of the evolution .",
    "the mass of the gas disk is slightly greater in run  dhir .",
    "it turned out that the initial rotation of the gas halo leads more gas accretion from the halo to the disk but delays the star formation activity in the disk .",
    "the specific mechanism of how the rotation hinders star formation , however , needs to be further investigated .",
    "with model  dhir and model  d we performed four more simulations including supernova - driven galactic winds . in these wind test runs ,",
    "the sfrs come out lower than the corresponding runs without winds at all times as expected .",
    "both axial and isotropic winds result in overall similar sfrs .",
    "the run with the reduced wind efficiency shows higher sfr than that with the default value of the wind efficiency .    in our initial galaxy models , we kept the total mass of the system as well as the total masses of the halo ( dm + gas ) , disk ( stars + gas ) , and bulge components equally to focus on examining the impacts of the different gas distribution and rotation of the gas halo .",
    "our simulation results , such as in the gas dissipation and accretion and the star formation activities , are restricted by our initial galaxy models and the parameter values in the simulation code .",
    "the wind effects would also be affected by a variety of factors , for instance the total mass of the galaxy model , and be limited by the provided wind model in the code .    nonetheless , numerical studies to seek more realistic galaxy models including a gas halo component are demanded since the component as a large reservoir of gas influences the evolution of the galaxies .",
    "adding a gas halo in numerical simulations , various gas dynamical processes that may occur in real systems both isolated or interacting with others , would be better interpreted .",
    "the galaxy models are eventually compared with the ` galaxies ' in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "we plan to use our isolated galaxy models to understand the morphology and luminosity transformation of interacting galaxies @xcite found in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",

    "for the gas particles , we set zero dispersion .",
    "the procedure for making model  dhir ( disk plus halo model with rotation ) is the same as in model  dhi ( the fiducial model ) , except an additional step for giving rotation of the gas halo using a simple code we made .",
    "we set the rotation such that the gas halo has the rotation curve with a similar shape but half the amplitude of that of the disk .    to build either the disk - only model ( model  d ) or the halo - only model ( model  hi ) , one can follow the steps described above but skipping the parts related to either the gas halo or the gas disk , respectively .",
