    "since the 1935 famous publication by einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) @xcite , which posed the problem in its clearest form , the quantum theory has repeatedly eluded any simple realistic interpretation .",
    "although epr actually aimed at demonstrating quantum theory incompleteness , the subsequent celebrated bell s theorem showed that no possible theory assuming additional `` hidden variables '' in order to describe the underlying reality could be in agreement with quantum predictions , provided one also made the very plausible assumption of `` locality '' @xcite for the behavior of such hidden variables .",
    "the difference between the predictions of quantum theory and those of all possible local realistic theories could be quantified in well defined `` inequalities '' concerning measurement outcome probabilities @xcite , and hence could be tested in actual experiments , which systematically confirmed the validity of quantum predictions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "later , bell s and epr assumption of locality has been linked to the more general concept of `` non - contextuality '' .",
    "the latter is the assumption that measurement results ( even individual results , not only probabilities ) for a given observable are independent of the choice of other compatible observables that are measured at ( about ) the same time @xcite .",
    "the importance of this generalization was highlighted by the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite , stating that for any physical system , prepared in any possible state ( including separable states showing no special correlations , unlike epr states ) , there exist a finite set of observables such that it is impossible to pre - assign them noncontextual results ( i.e. , independent of which other compatible observables are jointly measured ) respecting the predictions of quantum theory .    the thought experiment ideated by hardy in 1993 @xcite  `` one of the strangest and most beautiful gems yet to be found in the extraordinary soil of quantum mechanics '' , in the words of david mermin @xcite  provides yet another way to highlight the conflict between the predictions of quantum mechanics and any non - contextual realistic interpretation .",
    "like the greenberger , horne , and zeilinger ( ghz ) proposal @xcite , hardy s paradox ideally relies only on testing a set of certainty or impossibility ( `` all versus nothing '' ) statements , as opposed to the quantitative assessment of probabilities needed for testing the original bell s theorem , thus providing a form of `` bell s theorem without inequalities '' . on the other hand ,",
    "hardy s paradox has some advantages with respect to the ghz one : only two , instead of three , compatible observables are required and only a partial , as opposed to maximal , degree of entanglement is needed .",
    "in fact , hardy s paradox can be considered to be intermediate between the epr - like paradoxes ( including ghz one ) , requiring a maximally entangled state , and the ks paradox , which applies to any state , including separable ones  @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental tests of hardy s paradox have been carried out hitherto @xcite , adopting different approaches , but all based on measuring properties of two separated particles ( usually photons ) .",
    "therefore , these tests mainly emphasized nonlocality , similarly to the experiments testing bell - like inequalities .",
    "if we instead choose to focus on the more general concept of contextuality , we may also carry out experiments involving different degrees of freedom of a same particle .",
    "this approach has been taken already several times in the past , for experimentally testing the epr , ghz or ks paradoxes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but to our knowledge it has not been applied before to hardy s paradox . here , we carry out a single - particle experimental test of hardy s paradox by measuring two compatible degrees of freedom of the same photon , namely its spin angular momentum ( sam ) and its orbital angular momentum ( oam ) . as for other experiments involving different degrees of freedom of a same particle",
    ", we can not use locality to logically enforce non - contextuality , which must therefore be assumed , based only on the observables compatibility ( which might be tested with separate experiments ) . on the other hand , a single - photon experiment such as ours is simpler to implement and may allow much larger detection efficiencies than typical two - photon ones .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii recalls the basic idea of hardy s paradox and illustrates its implementation in a spin - orbit four - dimensional hilbert space of a single photon .",
    "our experiment and its results are then described in section iii .",
    "brief conclusions follow in section iv .",
    "in addition , an appendix is included with a proof of the statistical inequality that can be used to extend hardy s paradox to the case in which experimental noise and imperfections preclude an all - versus - nothing test .",
    "hardy s paradox in our specific single - photon implementation can be sketched as follows .",
    "alice and bob must measure the properties of the photon and they agree on splitting the work : alice will measure the photon polarization state and bob its oam .",
    "however , alice can choose between two different polarization measurement setups , providing either one of two mutually incompatible observables that we will define in detail further on : for the time being , let us just call them @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in practice , alice makes her setup choice by rotating a set of birefringent plates placed before a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "similarly , bob can choose between two different oam measurement setups , providing either one of the two mutually incompatible observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "bob s choice is performed by selecting different hologram patterns visualized on a spatial light modulator ( slm ) . for both alice and bob ,",
    "all observable measurements have only two possible outcomes , which will conventionally be labeled with the values @xmath4 .",
    "observable choice is supposed not to affect in any way bob s measurement and vice versa , because the experimental procedures act on independent degrees of freedom of the photon .",
    "this corresponds to saying that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are compatible with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "alice and bob carry out a large number of measurements over an ensemble of identically prepared photons , choosing every time at random the observable to be measured for each degree of freedom . in this way , they estimate from the experimental frequencies the probabilities @xmath5 of different pairs of properties for the photon .",
    "in particular , they observe the following properties in their results :    1 .",
    "[ eq : p1 ] : the outcome @xmath6 and @xmath7 never occurs , that is @xmath8 2 .",
    "[ eq : p2 ] : the outcome @xmath9 and @xmath10 never occurs , that is @xmath11 3 .",
    "[ eq : p3 ] : the outcome @xmath12 and @xmath13 never occurs , that is @xmath14    as we shall prove further below , for any realistic non - contextual model , these three properties should logically imply the validity of the following fourth property :    1 .",
    "[ eq : p4 ] : the outcome @xmath12 and @xmath10 never occurs , that is @xmath15    in contrast , alice and bob find that , in a sizable fraction of their measurements , the outcome @xmath12 and @xmath10 is indeed obtained , thus contradicting p4 .",
    "this is hardy s paradox .",
    "the proof of [ eq : p4 ] from [ eq : p1]-[eq : p3 ] is very simple . in a realistic non - contextual model , alice s and bob s measurement outcome events can be represented as venn diagrams , which may be drawn on a plane that spans the underlying ( hidden ) reality determining all observable results .",
    "the venn sets associated to the outcomes @xmath16 , and @xmath10 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : venn ] . from property",
    "[ eq : p2 ] we infer that each time bob measures @xmath3 , finding @xmath10 , then if alice measures @xmath0 , she would certainly find @xmath6 . in other words ,",
    "the event @xmath10 implies the event @xmath6 which is represented by the fact that the venn set for the event @xmath10 is internal to that for the event @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : venn ] .",
    "similarly , from [ eq : p3 ] we infer that the event @xmath12 implies the event @xmath7 , that is , the venn set of the event @xmath12 is internal to that of the event @xmath7 .",
    "venn diagrams for the events @xmath16 , and @xmath10 , satisfying conditions [ eq : p1 ] , [ eq : p2 ] , [ eq : p3 ] .",
    "the sets @xmath12 and @xmath10 being internal to disjoint sets can not intersect , so that [ eq : p4 ] follows immediately.,width=264 ]    now property [ eq : p1 ] implies that the venn sets of the events @xmath6 and @xmath7 have no intersection , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : venn ] .",
    "it is now evident from the figure that the sets of the events @xmath12 and @xmath10 can not intersect as well , from which we deduce property [ eq : p4 ] . it should be noted that the simultaneous presence of venn sets for the results of incompatible observables , such as for example @xmath0 and @xmath1 , reveals a counterfactual aspect of the presented reasoning , because no single event can yield results for both observables , since they require different setups .",
    "however , we are actually assuming that , even when not measured , all observables values have a definite probability in each event .",
    "let us now illustrate the quantum mechanical description of the experiment and , based on that , we shall also specify the details of the state preparation and observable definitions to be used .",
    "indeed , for a proper choice of states and observables , quantum mechanics can satisfy [ eq : p1 ] , [ eq : p2 ] , and [ eq : p3 ] and violate [ eq : p4 ] , in agreement with observations and in contradiction with a non - contextual realistic interpretation .    to start with",

    ". we may think of state ( [ eq : psi ] ) as a generic state in the four - dimensional spin - orbit hilbert space @xmath31 , up to `` local '' unitary operations acting separately on the polarization and oam degrees of freedom . only separable states ( corresponding to @xmath32 , with @xmath33 any integer ) and maximally entangled states ( @xmath34 ) can not be used for implementing the hardy paradox , as we shall see . in particular ,",
    "in the following we shall restrict @xmath29 to the range @xmath35 .",
    "let us now define the observables to be measured by alice and bob . in two - dimensional hilbert spaces ,",
    "all observables can be defined by giving a pair of orthogonal states that form a basis .",
    "so , let us first introduce the following four states in each qubit hilbert subspace : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the observable operators are then defined as follows : @xmath40 these definitions correspond to saying that in order to measure , for example , @xmath0 , alice must project the photon state onto @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if the first projection ( which is actually a filtering operation , in the experiment ) succeeds , then the observable value is @xmath43 , otherwise it is @xmath44 .",
    "similar procedures apply to all other observables .",

    "more precisely , the inequality arising in hardy s paradox is the following one ( see appendix a for a proof ) : @xmath87 this inequality should hold true in any non - contextual realistic model and is trivially satisfied in the ideal noiseless case given by properties [ eq : p1][eq : p4 ] .",
    "but it is violated by quantum predictions .",
    "our results reported above also violate the inequality by over seven standard deviations , thus confirming the contextual behavior of quantum mechanics .",
    "in synthesis , we have demonstrated generation of partially entangled spin - orbit states of single photons and have exploited such states to carry out an experimental test of hardy s paradox .",
    "although ideally hardy s paradox is an all - versus - nothing statement , so that a single event could be enough to prove that its assumptions must be wrong , in practice experimental noise forces the use of an inequality and of a statistical verification , similar to the case of a bell inequality test . in our experiment , we verified that the inequality was violated with high statistical confidence .",
    "this proves that a non - contextual realistic model of the system can not be true .",
    "non - contextuality in our single particle experiment was assumed based on the observable compatibility , and not on their spatial separation .",
    "while this is a conceptual limitation of our test , the use of a single particle demonstrated in our approach has some other advantages .",
    "the first is that the experiment is much simpler to implement .",
    "we used a heralded photon regime , but a similar demonstration could be based on an attenuated light source , thus making it even simpler .",
    "simple - to - perform experiments testing the conceptual paradoxes of quantum mechanics may have a strong educational value .",
    "a second advantage is that the quantum detection efficiency for a single - photon detection can be made significantly larger than for the two - photon case .",
    "this , in turn , could be exploited in the future to carry out hardy - like tests that are free from other assumptions , such as the fair sampling hypothesis , or other detection - related loopholes that may undermine their validity , similarly to the case of bell inequalities ( on this issue see , e.g. , refs .",

    "we derive here the inequality ( [ eq : inequality ] ) , which is to be satisfied by any realistic and non - contextual statistical model for hardy s paradox .",
    "realism of the model means that we can assign probabilities to the set of elementary events corresponding to each possible result of the measurement of the observables @xmath88 , even when they are not measured .",
    "because each measurement can have only the two results @xmath89 , we have sixteen probabilities associated to each event . the difference between a realistic statistical model and quantum mechanics stems from the fact that , in the former , probabilities can be assigned to any @xmath90-algebra of the elementary events , while this is impossible in quantum mechanics in general .",
    "for example , any realistic statistical model assigns values ( eventually zero or one ) to all 16 probabilities @xmath91 @xmath92 of the four - fold joint measurements of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , as reported in table  [ tab:1 ] , which is impossible in quantum mechanics , because the primed observables do not commute with the unprimed ones .",
    "besides realism , the model non - contextuality corresponds to the assumption that the results of a measurements on a given observable are independent of possible joint measurements carried out on other compatible observables .",
    "this means that each probability @xmath91 depends on the observables pertaining the system under study and not on the context in which the measurements are performed .",
    "in particular , the @xmath91 can not depend on parameters characterizing the measurement apparatus or the environment .",
    "non - contextuality is always assumed in classical physics and it is implicit in the probabilities @xmath91 in table  [ tab:1 ] , independently of their actual values . from the probabilities @xmath91 , we may easily calculate the probabilities defining properties [ eq : p1][eq : p4 ] , relevant for hardy s paradox .",

    "the compatibility of two observables @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be operationally defined by the observed independence of their measurement results from the order by which we measure them and the possible measurement repetition .",
