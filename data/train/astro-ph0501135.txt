    "the upper mass limit to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a critical parameter in understanding stellar populations , star formation , and massive star feedback in galaxies . to date ,",
    "the largest empirical mass estimate for an individual star is around @xmath4 for the pistol star ( figer et al .",
    "1998 ) near the galactic center , and around @xmath3 for the most massive stars in the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. , massey & hunter 1998 ) . in practice , most applications assume an upper mass limit to the imf of @xmath5 to @xmath6 . however , there is some confusion on whether the apparent observed upper limit simply represents a statistical limit owing to a lack of sampled stars in individual clusters ( massey 2003 ; massey & hunter 1998 ; elmegreen 1997 ) .    before the advent of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , stars with extremely high masses @xmath7 were suggested to exist .",
    "the dense stellar knot r136a in the 30 doradus star - forming region of the lmc was the best - known candidate for harboring such a star ( cassinelli , mathis , & savage 1981 ) .",
    "the viable candidates for these supermassive stars were eventually resolved by _ hst _ and ground - based imaging into smaller stars within the conventionally observed mass range ( e.g. , weigelt et al .",
    "1991 ; heydari - malayeri , remy , & magain 1988 ) . in recent years , however , the possibility of supermassive stars is receiving renewed attention as a possible mode of star formation in the early universe ( e.g. , bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; larson 1998 ; bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to clarify expectations for the highest - mass stars compared to the existing observations .",
    "elmegreen ( 2000 ) quantitatively demonstrates that , in the absence of an upper - mass cutoff , stellar masses should be observed up to @xmath8 for the entire milky way , based on estimates for the current star formation rate and molecular gas mass . here",
    ", we derive the behavior of the expectation values for the most massive stars and demonstrate that , for a universal imf , current observations indeed show the existence of an upper - mass limit around @xmath9 .",
    "because of the decreasing power law form of the imf , the characteristic mass of the largest star formed in clusters of @xmath1 stars decreases as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "figure  [ f_montecarlo ] demonstrates this effect with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xmath1 is drawn for individual star clusters from the universal power - law distribution in @xmath1 ( e.g. , oey & clarke 1998 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) : @xmath11 and the stellar masses for each cluster of @xmath1 stars is drawn from the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , within a mass range of 20 to 100 @xmath12 : @xmath13 figure  [ f_montecarlo ] shows the distribution of the most massive star in each cluster , @xmath14 vs @xmath15 . for single stars , we confirm that the bin of @xmath16 is described simply by the imf ( equation  [ eq_imf ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that for large @xmath1 , one can expect that @xmath17 , but that for small @xmath1 , the typical most massive star is much lower in mass . for @xmath18",
    ", the typical @xmath14 is the mean of the imf , which is 37 @xmath12 for the distribution of @xmath19 used in figure  [ f_montecarlo ] .",
    "we can analytically derive the expectation value @xmath10  for the most massive star in an ensemble of @xmath1 stars as follows .",
    "for @xmath1 stars , the probability that all are in the mass range 0 to @xmath20 is , @xmath21^n \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 corresponds to the imf , i.e. , a probability distribution function whose integral is unity .",
    "it follows that the probability that all the stars are in the mass range 0 to @xmath23 is , @xmath24^n +      \\frac{d}{dm}\\biggl[\\int_{0}^m \\phi(m)\\ dm\\biggr]^n \\ dm\\ ] ] by taylor expansion .",

    "we numerically integrate equation  [ eq_mmax ] using a lower mass limit @xmath29 instead of 0 , and assuming the salpeter imf .",
    "figure  [ f_mmax ] shows the expectation value for the most massive star @xmath10  vs the upper mass limit @xmath2  for @xmath30 250 , and 1000 stars ( solid lines ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the identical relation @xmath31 for comparison . for lower @xmath1 , @xmath10  is smaller at",
    "any given @xmath2 , as expected .",
    "we start by comparing figure  [ f_mmax ] to the r136a region in 30 doradus , which , at an age of 12 myr ( massey & hunter 1998 ) , is sufficiently young that none of its stars have expired yet as supernovae .",
    "we consider stars having @xmath32 , of which hunter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found @xmath33 in this region .",
    "we however note that this value represents a strong lower limit , since the star counts are significantly incomplete between 10 and 15 @xmath34 ( massey & hunter 1998 ) . figure  [ f_mmax ] demonstrates that the expectation value of @xmath0 is considerably greater than the observed maximum of @xmath35 in r136a , unless @xmath2  is low ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "weidner & kroupa ( 2004 ) reached the same conclusion from a similar analysis of r136a ; selman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also suggested a cutoff using a less rigorous analysis .",
    "we can furthermore assess the statistical significance of this result by calculating @xmath37 , the probability of obtaining an observed maximum stellar mass @xmath38 for a given @xmath2 .",
    "table  [ t_sample ] lists @xmath37  calculated from equation  [ eq_prob ] for r136a for a range of @xmath2 .",
    "this demonstrates the negligible likelihood ( @xmath39 ) that r136a is drawn from a population which extends to 1000 @xmath12 .",
    "the results of weidner and kroupa ( 2004 ) , and those presented here , do not support the suggestion by massey ( 2003 ) and massey & hunter ( 1998 ) that the upper imf in the r136a is consistent with @xmath40 .",
    "massey & hunter ( 1998 ) found that the penultimate mass bin in the empirical mass function is fully consistent with the salpeter slope .",
    "however , they omit from their mass function , and from their analysis , stars with inferred masses @xmath41 , because the lack of stellar models in the grid preclude reliable mass determinations . for the two effective temperature scales they adopted , there are 2 or 9 of these omitted , most - massive stars . although we do not know the exact masses , their numbers are sufficient to determine whether an upper mass cutoff to the imf power law exists . for a salpeter imf , in the absence of an upper mass cutoff , there should be a total of 1.7 times more stars at @xmath42 than are found in the the mass bin 85  120@xmath43 .",
    "massey & hunter ( 1998 ) count ( 8 , 11 ) stars in the latter mass bin , therefore implying that ( 14 , 19 ) stars should be found at higher masses .",
    "this is significantly more than the ( 2 , 9 ) stars found .",
    "thus , r136a exhibits a cutoff around @xmath3 , consistent with the finding by weidner & kroupa ( 2004 ) .",
    "although a truncated imf in r136a seems conclusively demonstrated , it is possible that the dense , rich cluster environment of this region represents a special case .",
    "can we draw a similar conclusion from a wider sample of ordinary ob associations ? to examine this further , we consider the upper imf from the substantial sample of ob associations that have been uniformly studied by massey and collaborators , who estimated stellar masses from spectroscopic classifications .",
    "massey , johnson , & degioia - eastwood ( 1995 ) tabulate the numbers of stars having @xmath44 in the milky way and lmc associations . to minimize the possibility that the most massive stars have already expired as supernovae",
    ", we count only stars in ob associations with ages @xmath45 myr .",
    "table  [ t_sample ] shows the observed @xmath46 and @xmath0 for these objects .",
    "we now compute @xmath37  for all the objects",
    "( table  [ t_sample ] ) .",
    "these show that , although none of these regions individually provide strong constraints on the upper mass cutoff , they collectively point to a conclusion similar to that found for r136a . the total @xmath47 stars , for which inspection of figure  [ f_mmax ] again shows that the observed maximum stellar masses imply that @xmath2  should not exceed a few hundred @xmath12 .",
    "elmegreen ( 2000 ) reached a similar conclusion based on the lack of supermassive stars in the entire population of the milky way . in considering the total of 263 stars , or milky way population ,",
    "we assume that the imf is a universal probability distribution function that is independent of specific conditions in individual clusters and parent molecular clouds .",
    "indeed , the imf is conventionally treated as a universal function ( see , e.g. , elmegreen 2000 ) . we also emphasize that our total counts of @xmath1 are conservative lower limits , since additional young massive stars can be counted from associations studied by other authors .",
    "we chose not to include these additional stars in the interest of maintaining a uniform and well - understood sample .",
    "furthermore , we can now evaluate the total probabilities @xmath48 that the values of @xmath37  represent uniform distributions between 0 and 1 , as expected for any universal @xmath2 .",
    "for example , we would expect 10% of the regions to fall into the category where @xmath37  was @xmath49 , 20% to have a @xmath37  of @xmath50 , and so on .",
    "figure  [ f_centhist120 ] shows , for each assumed @xmath2  of the parent imf , the distribution of @xmath37  for the individual regions .",
    "it is evident that for higher values of @xmath2 , the values of @xmath37  are unacceptably clustered towards small values .",
    "a k - s test confirms this conclusion , yielding probabilities that these values are uniformly distributed , of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for , respectively , @xmath2  @xmath53 and 120 @xmath12 .",
    "we also compute @xmath48 for an adopted observed @xmath54 , as might be possible for tr  14/16 and r136a ( table  [ t_sample ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f_centhist200 ] shows the respective results in this case : @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath2  @xmath57 and 150 @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore see that @xmath2  @xmath58 , and even @xmath59 , are effectively ruled out .",

    "we have analyzed the upper imf in a sample of young , nearby ob associations that best represents stellar census data in this regime .",
    "the clusters are young enough that their highest - mass members remain present , and the stellar masses are spectroscopically determined by massey and collaborators ( massey et al .",
    "1995 ; massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "our results provide clear evidence for an upper truncation in the imf .",
    "while this result has been previously noted by weidner & kroupa in the case of r136a , we show here that it also applies to a much wider sample of ob associations .",
    "we have furthermore quantified the statistical significance of such statements .",
    "for example , we find that the probability that the stellar population of r136a is drawn from a parent distribution having @xmath2@xmath62 is @xmath63 , and for other associations the probability is only a few percent .",
    "it should be noted that our results are sensitive to the slope of the imf for stars more massive than @xmath64 . in this mass range , it is often reported that the imf power - law exponent is close to the salpeter value @xmath65 ( e.g. , massey 2003 ; schaerer 2003 ; kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "however , should the slope through some systematic observational bias be significantly steeper , then our demonstration of an upper - mass cutoff becomes less vivid .",
    "for example , we find that adopting an imf slope of @xmath66 yields an aggregate probability that the clusters originate from an imf having @xmath2@xmath67 of @xmath68 , contrasted to @xmath69 for the salpeter slope .",
    "conversely , for a parent imf slope flatter than the salpeter value , the existence of an upper - mass cutoff is even more strongly demonstrated .",
    "for r136a , @xmath70 for the steeper slope ( _ cf . _ table  1 ) , which is still a negligible probability .",
    "weidner & kroupa ( 2004 ) examine the influence of the slope in more detail .",
    "thus , given the standard salpeter slope for massive stars , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the imf is truncated near @xmath9 , based on this analysis .",
    "if these results are real , the only other possibilities are that the imf is not universal , or there is an extreme selection effect that prevents our observations of the most massive stars .",
    "we note that @xmath2  need not be an absolute limit , but represents at least a dramatic drop from the power - law form of the imf .",
    "our conclusion depends on the assumption that the highest mass stars have not already expired , and it therefore depends critically on the reliability of evolutionary models for the most massive stars , and on the reliability with which one can assign ages to ob associations .",
    "it also assumes that the stars in the ob associations are coeval .",
