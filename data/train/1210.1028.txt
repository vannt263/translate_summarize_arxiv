    "the binary ferromagnetic fe - co alloy has been known for a long time as a system with the maximum spontaneous magnetization among the transition - metal systems .",
    "@xcite its basic magnetic properties , such as the concentration dependence of the alloy magnetization ( the slater - pauling curve ) in the ground - state body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure , have been reproduced successfully by _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations in a number of studies .",
    "@xcite this system attracted renewed interest several years ago , after a theoretical prediction of a giant uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) of the body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys .",
    "@xcite the uniaxial mae is defined quantitatively as the difference of total energies for the magnetization direction parallel to the tetragonal @xmath4 and @xmath5 axis , @xmath6 .",
    "the calculated mae reached high values , @xmath7ev / atom , obtained however only in a narrow range of the co concentration , @xmath8 , and of the tetragonal strain , @xmath9 .",
    "the combination of the high mae with the high magnetization makes the bct fe - co system a promising material for fabrication of ferromagnetic thin films with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( the magnetic easy axis perpendicular to the film plane ) , which might be relevant as high - density magnetic recording media .",
    "most of experimental realizations of this tetragonal system employed the possibility to grow epitaxially strained fe - co alloy films of a varying composition on different non - magnetic transition - metal substrates with the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure , such as pd(001 ) , rh(001 ) , and ir(001 ) .",
    "@xcite the different lattice parameters of the substrates enable one to scan a relatively wide interval of the @xmath10-ratio of the fe - co films , namely @xmath11 ( note that @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer respectively to the ideal bcc and fcc lattices ) .",
    "the measurements of the _ in situ _ magneto - optical kerr effect @xcite ( moke ) confirmed the theoretical prediction of ref .   on a qualitative level ; in particular , a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the films was observed for compositions and tetragonal distortions in a rough agreement with the calculated trends of the bulk @xmath14 . however , systematic quantitative experimental studies of the mae of the films have not been performed yet ; available values of the @xmath14 for a few selected systems @xcite are appreciably smaller than the calculated ones .",
    "the missing information on the mae has partly been compensated by measurements of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) spectra , which provide orbital magnetic moments of both alloy constituents .",
    "@xcite the latter measurements , performed on the rh(001 ) substrate corresponding to @xmath15 , revealed enhanced orbital moments in fe@xmath2co@xmath3 films around @xmath16 , in a close relation to the predicted maximum of the bulk uniaxial mae .",
    "nevertheless , the existing agreement between the theory and the experiment should be taken with caution .",
    "the original approach of ref .",
    "employed the so - called virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , in which the true species of a random binary alloy are replaced by a single element with an effective atomic number given by the alloy composition .",
    "the vca has been implemented in various _ ab initio _ methods and used for a number of alloys of neighboring elements in the periodic table .",
    "@xcite its application to the bcc fe - co and fcc co - ni systems @xcite yields concentration trends of the spin magnetic moment in a very good agreement with experiment ; @xcite the orbital magnetic moments seem to be described reliably in the vca as well .",
    "however , a recent first - principles study of the random bct fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys , @xcite based on a supercell technique applied to a few special co concentrations ( @xmath17 , 0.625 , and 0.75 ) , has shown that a realistic treatment of the chemical disorder can reduce the mae by a factor of 1.5@xmath183 as compared to the simple vca .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to present and discuss the results of a systematic _ ab initio _ calculation of the mae for the disordered bulk tetragonal fe - co systems obtained by using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) as a basic tool of the theory of metallic alloys .",
    "@xcite for homogeneous bct alloys , we compare results of the vca and the cpa , show the big difference between them , and identify the underlying physical mechanism in terms of the electronic structure . moreover , we investigate the effect of a complete and an incomplete atomic long - range order on the mae ; this study is motivated by the existing prediction of a large uniaxial mae in stoichiometric perfectly ordered tetragonal feco and feco@xmath19 systems .",
    "@xcite similar theoretical studies have so far been done mainly for tetragonal fept alloys @xcite and very recently also for the feco alloy .",
    "@xcite these works are confined to stoichiometric equiconcentration alloys ; in general , their results reveal a decrease of the mae due to imperfect chemical ordering .",
    "all calculations of this study employed a bct lattice with the wigner - seitz @xmath20 radius equal to that of pure bcc iron , @xmath21 where @xmath22  m denotes the bohr radius .",
    "the neglect of volume relaxations on the mae in a broad range of lattice parameters and of alloy concentrations is justified by a more general study of ref .   within the vca .",
    "this structure model ",
    "the volume conserving tetragonal distortion ( the bain path)coincides with that used in the original study @xcite and in the recent study of the partially ordered fept alloy .",
    "@xcite    the effect of atomic long - range ordering has been studied for the case of @xmath1 ( cuau ) order relevant for compositions not far from the equiconcentration fe@xmath23co@xmath23 system .",
    "the bct structure is partitioned in two simple tetragonal sublattices ( alternating atomic planes perpendicular to the tetragonal @xmath5 axis ) . for the fe@xmath2co@xmath3 system ,",
    "an additional concentration variable @xmath24 is introduced , such that @xmath25 , which defines the chemical composition of both sublattices : fe@xmath26co@xmath27 in the fe - enriched planes and fe@xmath28co@xmath29 in the co - enriched planes .",
    "note that the homogeneous solid solution corresponds to @xmath30 , while the other end of the @xmath24-interval describes the maximum @xmath1 order compatible with the given total co concentration @xmath31 .",
    "this model is a natural generalization of the model used for the stoichiometric fept systems . @xcite",
    "the eletronic structure calculations were done by means of the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) @xcite with a full inclusion of relativistic effects by solving the one - electron dirac equation @xcite with the @xmath32-basis of the valence orbitals .",
    "the effective spin - polarized potential was constructed in the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) using the parametrization of the exchange - correlation term according to ref .  .",
    "the effects of alloying were treated in the cpa for all systems ; @xcite for the homogeneous random alloys ( @xmath30 ) , the simple vca was used as well .",
    "the reliable evaluation of the mae in metallic systems represents a difficult task , especially for cubic @xmath33 transition metals owing to the weakness of the spin - orbit interaction and the high symmetry of cubic structures .",
    "@xcite the situation is more favorable for uniaxial systems ( tetragonal , trigonal , hexagonal ) @xcite and for systems with @xmath34-electrons , see ref .   for a review . in a number of existing studies , including the very recent ones , @xcite the magnetic force theorem @xcite is used and the total energy difference @xmath14 is approximated by the change in the sum of occupied valence one - particle eigenvalues . in this study , we go beyond this approximation and evaluate the mae directly from the total energies of the fully self - consistent solutions for both magnetization directions , @xcite which requires high accuracy in total - energy calculations .",
    "we have used uniform sampling meshes of about @xmath35 @xmath36-points for averages over the full brillouin zone ( bz ) of the bct lattices , while about @xmath37 @xmath36-points have been used for the bz of the simple tetragonal bravais lattices of the @xmath1 ordered systems .",
    "the total energies were converged to 0.1 @xmath38ev / atom for all systems ; this accuracy is sufficient in view of the resulting values of @xmath14 ( see below ) .",
    "the dependence of the uniaxial mae of the random fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys on the chemical composition and the @xmath10-ratio , calculated in the vca and in the cpa , is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_2d_mae ] ; for better transparency , only the positive values of the @xmath14 are displayed in the plots , while the cases with negative @xmath14 have been omitted ( marked by white color ) .",
    "the vca results ( fig .",
    "[ f_2d_mae]a ) agree nicely with both previous studies ; @xcite in particular , a sharp maximum of the mae , @xmath39ev / atom , obtained for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , is clearly visible .",
    "the maximum mae of @xmath42ev / atom for @xmath40 and for @xmath10 between 1.22 and 1.24 was reported in ref .",
    "( with a slight sensitivity to the particular model of the volume relaxation employed ) and practically the same values were obtained in the original vca study .",
    "@xcite minor quantitative differences might be ascribed to different computational schemes employed .",
    "the mae in the cpa ( fig .",
    "[ f_2d_mae]b ) exhibits a similar trend as in the vca ; however , the cpa maximum is significantly smaller , @xmath43ev / atom .",
    "the latter value is obtained for @xmath40 and @xmath44 , but the maximum is very flat and essentially the same @xmath14 values can be found in a broad region of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ f_2d_mae]b .",
    "the maximum @xmath14 in the cpa is reduced by a factor of four as compared to that in the vca , which is an even stronger reduction than that reported in ref .  .",
    "the small mae values in the cpa might be used to explain the difference between the large @xmath14 values predicted in the vca and the much smaller values inferred from measurements on thin fe - co films .",
    "@xcite undoubtedly , the better description of the chemical disorder in the cpa as compared to the vca contributes to the reduction of the mae of prepared alloy thin films . however , a thorough quantitative analysis of this point is impossible at present and it could even be misleading because of the well - known uncertainty of the lsda to yield quantitatively correct maes in @xmath33 transition - metal systems .",
    "for this reason , an analysis of the trends seems to be more appropriate , see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein .    co@xmath47 alloy with magnetization along @xmath48 axis as functions of the @xmath10-ratio : the alloy orbital moment in the vca and the species - resolved orbital moments in the cpa .",
    "[ f_orbmm ] ]    in general , the lsda underestimates both the maes and the orbital magnetism .",
    "@xcite a counterexample to this rule is represented by the mae of the ordered fept alloy , @xcite which is overestimated in the lsda probably owing to an interplay of intraatomic coulomb correlations , weak exchange splitting and strong spin - orbit interaction of pt atoms .",
    "@xcite the present results for the bct fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys seem to confirm the general rule as can be documented by two facts .",
    "first , the effective mae of strained fe - co thin films , given by the difference of the bulk @xmath14 and the magnetostatic shape anisotropy energy @xmath49 , comes out positive for alloys in the vicinity of @xmath16 and @xmath50 ( near the maximum of @xmath14 in the cpa ) .",
    "this situation would thus lead to an out - of - plane orientation of the thin - film magnetization , in a qualitative agreement with existing experiments .",
    "@xcite note that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the permeability of the vacuum and where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote , respectively , the alloy magnetic moment per atom and the atomic volume . in the present case , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the bohr magneton , one obtains @xmath57ev / atom , which lies below the bulk mae ( @xmath58ev / atom ) .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , corresponding roughly to the fe@xmath23co@xmath23 films grown on the pd(001 ) substrate , our calculated values are @xmath61ev / atom , @xmath62 , and @xmath63ev / atom , which indicates an in - plane orientation of the magnetization , in contrast to the out - of - plane orientation observed at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite second , the calculated orbital magnetic moments in the bulk fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys , plotted in fig .  [ f_orbmm ] for @xmath64 , are appreciably smaller than the values obtained from the measured xmcd spectra by employing the sum rules .",
    "@xcite in particular , the measured values for films with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , namely , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , exceed their bulk theoretical counterparts by a factor of three .",
    "a similar relation of the experiment and the lsda theory ( quantified roughly by a factor between 1.5 and 2 ) was obtained for bcc fe - co alloys .",
    "@xcite moreover , the data in fig .",
    "[ f_orbmm ] prove that the vca and the cpa yield qualitatively different trends of the orbital magnetism versus the @xmath10-ratio : the pronounced maximum at @xmath41 in the vca is replaced by very flat maxima of both local orbital moments in the cpa .",
    "this difference indicates that applicability of the vca to all details of magnetism of the fe - co system is limited , being confined probably only to the cubic structures .",
    "@xcite    in view of the above mentioned problems to evaluate reliably the maes and the orbital magnetic moments , we have not attempted to recalculate our results by techniques going beyond the lsda , @xcite but have focused on the strong difference between the vca and the cpa and on the role of disorder on the mae in the tetragonal fe - co systems .",
    "the giant mae obtained in the vca was ascribed originally to the changes in the band structure accompanying the tetragonal distortion of the effective feco crystal .",
    "@xcite the explanation rests on a coincidence of two particular eigenvalues at the @xmath67 point , which occurs in the minority spin ( spin - down ) channel . for a special alloy composition and a special @xmath10-ratio",
    ", this coincidence takes place just at the fermi energy corresponding to the particular filling of the spin - down band .",
    "the large contribution of this eigenvalue pair to the mae can be understood in terms of the second - order perturbation theory , in which the effect of the weak spin - orbit interaction can be safely included .",
    "@xcite in this approach , the enhanced value of the @xmath14 of the bulk fe - co alloys can be explained due to the coupling between @xmath68 and @xmath69 states mediated by the orbital momentum operator @xmath70 , see ref .   for details .",
    "the physical origin of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the strained fe - co films is thus similar to that of au covered co monolayers on an au(111 ) substrate .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , however , the resulting positive mae is caused by the @xmath70 coupling between @xmath71 and @xmath72 states .",
    "co@xmath47 alloy with @xmath73 as functions of the energy .",
    "the dotted vertical line denotes the position of the fermi level .",
    "[ f_dos ] ]    the usual band structures are not relevant for the electronic structure of random alloys , for which more appropriate quantities , such as the densities of states ( dos ) and the bloch spectral functions ( bsf ) , have to be studied .",
    "@xcite motivated by the above explanation of the giant mae , we present these quantities for the random bct fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys in the cpa , evaluated without the spin - orbit interaction , i.e. , in the scalar - relativistic approximation .",
    "@xcite    the spin - polarized local doss are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_dos ] for the system with @xmath40 and @xmath73 .",
    "the shapes of the individual doss prove a very weak disorder in the majority spin ( spin - up ) channel , whereas the spin - down band exhibits a regime of a stronger scattering .",
    "this type of spin - dependent disorder was found in the bcc fe - co system a long time ago ; @xcite it is responsible , e.g. , for the observed concentration trend of the residual resistivity .",
    "@xcite note that the strong disorder is present in the spin - down @xmath0-band , which is only partially occupied and which thus contributes a lot to the alloy total energy and , consequently , to the mae .",
    "co@xmath47 alloy at @xmath74 as functions of the energy for three values of the @xmath10-ratio .",
    "the dotted vertical lines denote positions of the fermi levels . for details , see the text .",
    "[ f_bsf ] ]    the spin - polarized bsfs at the @xmath67 point for the fe@xmath75co@xmath47 alloy with three tetragonal distortions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f_bsf ] .",
    "the bsfs were resolved according to the irreducible representations of the point group @xmath76 of the bct lattice .",
    "@xcite the odd ( ungerade ) representations , belonging to @xmath77 orbitals , have been omitted in the plots since their contribution is negligible in the displayed energy interval .",
    "the relevant even ( gerade ) representations are : @xmath78 ( orbitals @xmath20 and @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath81 ( @xmath69 ) , and @xmath82 ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) .",
    "one can see that all spin - up bsf s , consisting of narrow lorentzian peaks , can be interpreted as bloch - like eigenstates with finite lifetimes due to a weak disorder .",
    "the spin - down bsf s above the fermi energy ( mainly @xmath78-like ) reflect effects of strong disorder ( non - quasiparticle behavior ) ; the profiles at and below the fermi energy are lorentzian peaks again",
    ". however , their widths are clearly bigger than the spin - up widths , in agreement with the spin - dependent disorder manifested in the dos .",
    "the maximum of the mae in the vca is found for an alloy with @xmath64 and with the tetragonal strain close to @xmath73 ; its spin - down bsf in the cpa ( fig .",
    "[ f_bsf ] , middle panel ) shows an analogy of the coincidence of the @xmath80 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath81 ( @xmath69 ) levels at the fermi energy .",
    "however , the disorder - induced smearing of both peaks is at least as big as their separation , which suppresses the contribution of this eigenvalue pair to the mae in the framework of the second - order perturbation theory .",
    "this feature proves that the minority - spin fe - co disorder is strong enough to reduce significantly the mae , which explains the very big difference between the vca and the cpa results , see section  [ sss_mae ] .      the adopted model of the",
    "partially ordered tetragonal fe@xmath2co@xmath3 alloys , namely , the model of two sublattices with chemical compositions fe@xmath26co@xmath27 and fe@xmath28co@xmath29 ( section [ s_mcd ] ) and the use of the cpa ( in contrast to supercell techniques ) enable one to study the mae as a function of three continuous variables : @xmath31 , @xmath24 , and @xmath10 .",
    "such a full three - dimensional scan is , however , computationally very demanding ; we have thus confined our study to co concentrations close to @xmath64 , for which the maximum mae was found in the homogeneous bct alloys both in the vca and in the cpa .",
    "the dependence of the calculated @xmath14 on the tetragonal distortion for @xmath64 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_maevsr ] for three degrees of the @xmath1 order .",
    "one can see that the very flat low maximum @xmath43ev / atom for the completely disordered alloy ( @xmath30 ) treated in the cpa is replaced by a significantly enhanced pronounced maximum @xmath83ev / atom obtained for the alloy with the maximum order ( @xmath84 ) compatible with the given co concentration ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the latter maximum is about two times smaller than that in the vca ( @xmath39ev / atom ) , which can be ascribed to the fact that the system with @xmath64 and @xmath84 has one sublattice without disorder ( pure co ) , whereas the other one is disordered , containing the rest co and all fe atoms .",
    "the mae of the system with an intermediate degree of the @xmath1 order ( @xmath85 ) exhibits the maximum and the trend very close to the fully disordered alloy .",
    "co@xmath47 alloy as a function of the tetragonal strain @xmath10 for different degrees of the @xmath1-like atomic order : the maximum order ( @xmath84 , diamonds ) , an intermediate order ( @xmath85 , full circles ) , and the complete randomness ( @xmath30 , crosses ) , all treated in the cpa . for a comparison , the mae of the completely random alloy in the vca is displayed as well ( triangles ) .",
    "[ f_maevsr ] ]    co@xmath3 alloys as a function of the degree of the @xmath1-like atomic order : for @xmath17 and @xmath86 ( full circles ) , and for @xmath64 and @xmath87 ( open squares ) .",
    "[ f_maevsy ] ]    the detailed dependence of the @xmath14 on the concentration variable @xmath24 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f_maevsy ] for two cases : the stoichiometric alloy ( @xmath17 , @xmath41 ) and the previous off - stoichiometric alloy ( @xmath64 , @xmath88 ) .",
    "the particular values of the @xmath10-ratio chosen in both cases correspond to the maximum @xmath14 value obtained for alloys with the maximum order , i.e. , for @xmath64 , @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ f_maevsr ] ) and for @xmath89 .",
    "one can see that the perfectly ordered ( @xmath90 ) stoichiometric alloy leads to a very high mae of @xmath91ev / atom .",
    "this value agrees well with ref .  , where the maximum mae for the same @xmath1 ordered system was obtained as @xmath92ev / atom .",
    "the convex shape of both dependences in fig .",
    "[ f_maevsy ] proves that the very high maes can be obtained only for systems with the maximum order ; even a small amount of additional disorder is detrimental to the maes and reduces them to much lower values of the completely random alloys .",
    "@xcite    strong sensitivity of the mae to the degree of the @xmath1 atomic order has recently been reported for the stoichometric fept alloy on an fcc lattice with small tetragonal distortions .",
    "@xcite the results of ref .   indicate that the chemical ordering is a more important factor for high mae values than the tetragonal distortion .",
    "our results for the fe - co system witness that both factors are of equal importance , see fig .",
    "[ f_maevsr ] .",
    "we believe that validity of this type of conclusions depends also on the range of relevant variables : the tetragonal distortion was varied over a narrower interval ( @xmath93 ) in ref .  , whereas a wider interval ( @xmath94 ) has been covered in our study .",
    "another difference between the two systems lies in the dependence of the mae on the @xmath10-ratio : the mae is an ever increasing function of @xmath10 in fept , @xcite in contrast to the maxima found for the fe - co systems around @xmath50 , see fig .",
    "[ f_2d_mae ] and fig .",
    "[ f_maevsr ] .",
    "these trends reflect probably the different origins of the high mae in these systems . in the fept alloys , the iron sites are responsible for strong exchange fields and the platinum sites provide strong spin - orbit interaction , both effects being only little dependent on the tetragonal distortion of the lattice . in the fe - co alloys ,",
    "both species are featured by strong exchange splittings and weak spin - orbit couplings ; the high maes are heavily based on collective properties ( band structure ) of the tetragonal systems .",
    "we have shown by means of first - principles lsda calculations that chemical disorder has a strong influence on the uniaxial mae of the bulk tetragonal fe - co systems .",
    "first , the complete neglect of the disorder , inherent to the simple vca , overestimates the mae by a large factor , whereas the more sophisticated cpa leads to a drastic reduction of the mae .",
    "the latter low maes are quite close to the magnetic shape anisotropy energy and the resulting estimated stability of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of thin strained fe - co films comes out probably smaller than the measured one .",
    "second , the disorder - induced reduction of the mae is due to the strong scattering regime in the minority - spin channel , which smears the bloch - like eigenstates at the fermi energy . third , an analysis of the calculated orbital magnetic moments points to a non - negligible underestimation of the orbital magnetism and , most probably , of the maes by the lsda .",
    "fourth , the @xmath1-like atomic long - range order leads to an enhancement of the mae values .",
    "the most pronounced enhancement is obtained for the maximum degree of the order , while imperfect ordering reduces the mae very rapidly as compared to the perfectly ordered systems .",
    "similar correlations between the atomic order and the mae have recently been found in the fept alloy @xcite and observed in artificially synthesized feni films .",
    "@xcite we believe that this interplay should be taken into account in a future search of advanced materials for high - density magnetic recording .",
