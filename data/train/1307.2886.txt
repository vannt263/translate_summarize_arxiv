    "more than 890 extrasolar planets ( or exoplanets ) have been discovered by now @xcite , and nasa s _ kepler _ mission alone has recently added more than 2,000 exoplanet candidates @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of exoplanets have been discovered using indirect detection techniques that infer the presence of the exoplanet by monitoring the host star , such as planetary transits or radial - velocity variations .",
    "the techniques require observations over at least one orbital period , making them impractical for detecting long - period exoplanets at large separations .",
    "meanwhile , in spite of the technical challenges , 8-m class telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems and/or coronagraphs have recently reached the high - contrast performance necessary to image massive planets at large orbital separations @xcite .",
    "direct imaging surveys using such instruments provide measurements of an exoplanet s position and luminosity , which can be used to estimate its mass using the age of its host star and models of luminosity evolution for planetary - mass objects .    because massive exoplanets cool and fade with time , direct - imaging searches have been most successful around young stars",
    ". mass estimates for young planets depend strongly on the assumed system age , planetary atmosphere models , and initial thermodynamic state , leading to large uncertainties in the inferred mass .",
    "planetary mass estimates conventionally assume a `` hot start '' , in which the planet is initially in a high - temperature , high - entropy ( and hence , luminous ) state @xcite .",
    "however , recent theoretical models suggest that giant planets produced according to standard formation theories could initially be much colder @xcite .",
    "the difference between the mass - luminosity relations of the `` hot - start '' and `` cold - start '' models decreases with exoplanet age ; the models converge after @xmath5100 myr for a 5 @xmath8 planet , and @xmath51 gyr for a 10 @xmath8 planet @xcite .",
    "previously imaged exoplanets are all younger than 50 myr @xcite .",
    "the hot - start models imply planetary masses @xcite , while cold - start models can not reproduce the high observed luminosities @xcite .",
    "therefore , their planetary status would be negated if the cold - start models apply at such young ages .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , in some cases can be used to exclude the coldest range of initial conditions , and confine their masses to the planetary - mass regime .",
    "in addition , we note that neither hot - start nor cold - start models have been calibrated against dynamical mass estimates .",
    "these arguments suggest that no fully established model for estimating the masses of directly imaged planets exists as of yet .",
    "however , direct imaging of an older system with a well - determined age could remove much of the model uncertainty related to the unknown initial conditions .",

    "gyrochronology , which directly measures this rate , is therefore the most direct , and may be the most reliable , of our age estimators ( mh08 ) , and allows us to obtain a best estimate of 160@xmath32 myr for the age of gj 504 .",
    "however , adopting the age as given by the star s chromospheric activity in addition to that from gyrochronology , we conservatively adopt 160@xmath3 myr as the age estimate of gj 504 system ( see figure [ fig : f0_age.eps ] for summary ) .",
    "we describe these age estimations in detail below , along with several other age indicators that are less well suited for the purpose .",
    "the rotation of a star slows as the star ages and the stellar wind carries away angular momentum .",
    "gyrochronology , which estimates a star s age from its rotation rate and @xmath33 color ( i.e. , mass ) , is generally considered to be the most direct , and possibly the most accurate , method for inferring stellar age ( mh08 ) .",
    "chromospheric and x - ray activity are powered by the stellar dynamo , which is closely related to the star s rotation rate .",
    "indeed , chromospheric age estimators often use stellar activity to infer the rotation period , which is then used to infer an age ( mh08 ) .",
    "the rotation period of gj 504 has been directly measured to be 3.328 days @xcite and 3.33 days @xcite .",
    "we adopt the average of these measurements , 3.329 days , as the star s rotation period .",
    "the possible error range of @xmath1 0.01 days is small enough not to affect the uncertainty of the age estimate .",
    "the gyrochronology can be applied to i - sequence stars whose dynamo mechanism is presumed to originate at the interface between the convective and radiative zones in the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this method can not be applied to c - sequence stars that are fully convective and may thus have a different dynamo mechanism that prevents efficient spin - down . we can judge that gj 504 is an i - sequence star using two different sets of criteria specified in the literature @xcite : one in which we relate the age - normalized rotation of gj 504 to other stars of similar @xmath33 colors , and the other in which the x - ray luminosity and rossby number are compared to other chromospherically active stars .",
    "both of these methods confirm that gj 504 is consistent with an i - sequence star .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the previous classification @xcite of gj 504 as an i - sequence star .    to rigorously establish the age of gj 504 , we use three gyrochronology relations independently proposed ( mh08 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) can be used for this purpose . as shown in figure [ fig : f1_rotations.pdf ] , the stars with similar @xmath33 colors to gj 504 in 130230 myr old clusters have periods that are the most consistent with that of gj 504 , and the rotation periods in the older 500600 myr cluster are significantly longer , thus verifying the age range of gj 504 derived above .",
    "additionally , combining the rotation data of stars in m11 with those in m34 , @xcite derive a median rotation period of g - type stars in these clusters of 4.8 days , again supporting the age estimate of 160@xmath34 myr for the g - type star gj 504 ( 3.329 day period ) .",
    "since gyrochronology is a largely empirical method , there could in principle be uncertainties involved in the methodology that are not accounted for in the calibrations .",
    "for instance , if we hypothesize that the calibration could be metallicity - dependent , this would lead to systematic errors for targets with significantly different metallicity from the calibration clusters .",
    "for the case of gj 504 , it has a non - extreme value in this regard , hence it is unlikely to be subject to such uncertainties .",
    "another possible systematic uncertainty in gyrochronology involves the fact that rotation is easier to detect in rapidly rotating systems , which could result in a bias in the empirical gyrochronology relation .",
    "if this were a significant effect , it would cause the apparent mean rotation in a cluster of a given age to appear more rapid than it is in reality .",
    "hence , age estimates for individual stars based on a relation calibrated against such clusters would result in an overestimation ( i.e. , an individual star would appear older than it really is ) .",
    "given that no other age indicators imply a significantly younger age for gj 504 this is also unlikely to be a real issue , but nonetheless , such uncertainties are important to keep in mind in the age analysis .",
    "stellar chromospheric activity , as traced by h and k emission , is a good indicator of stellar age .",
    "the strength of h and k emission is parameterized by @xmath35 , roughly the power in the h and k lines normalized to that in the underlying photospheric continuum .",
    "a relation between @xmath35 , @xmath33 color , and age has recently been derived for solar - type stars ( mh08 ) . for gj 504",
    ", we adopt the value of log @xmath36 measured at mt .",
    "wilson observatory with a temporal baseline of 30 yr @xcite , the longest such baseline in the literature .",
    "in order to minimize the uncertainty in @xmath35 , the value for which the star has been monitored for the longest possible time should be adopted ( see mh08 ) , which also protects against accidentally adopting an outlier in the activity variation .",
    "this activity level may be used to infer a rossby number , the ratio of the stellar rotation period to the timescale of convective overturn , of 0.60 @xmath16 0.10 following mh08 .",
    "we use this result , together with a @xmath33 color of 0.585 @xmath16 0.007 @xcite , to estimate an age of 330 @xmath16 100 myr .",
    "we further add a 0.2 dex scatter in this relation , estimated from clusters ( mh08 ) .",
    "we assume this scatter to be uncorrelated with other sources of error . as a result",
    ", we obtain a chromospheric age estimate of 330 @xmath16 180 myr .",
    "other studies using data from mt .",
    "wilson observatory have measured @xmath35 values of 4.443 @xcite and 4.486 @xcite , which differ slightly from our adopted value of 4.45 .",
    "the chromospheric activity level was also measured to be @xmath37 using 14 yr of observations at fairborn and lowell observatories @xcite .",
    "many of these studies observational baselines overlap with the source of our adopted @xmath35 value @xcite .",
    "adopting the mean of these measurements would have little effect on our chromospheric age of 330 @xmath16 180 myr .    a primary uncertainty in age determination from chromospheric activity is long - term activity cycles , which may easily exceed the timescales over which the activity is measured , and thus may potentially provide a systematic error if the activity is measured at an extreme but is taken to represent the mean activity for the star .",
    "in addition , as in the case of gyrochronology , the stellar activity also depends on the metallicity , possibly contributing to the uncertainty . since activity as an age estimator",
    "is thought to be closely related to gyrochronology through the stellar dynamo , the possibility of measuring both rotation ( which is robust against activity cycles ) and activity in the same star as for the case of gj 504 can alleviate this uncertainty .",
    "young solar - type stars are active x - ray emitters . as for h and k ,",
    "a relation has been derived ( mh08 ) between stellar age , color , and x - ray luminosity .",
    "the best estimate of the x - ray luminosity of gj 504 is from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey of nearby stars @xcite , which has provided a ratio of x - ray to bolometric power of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this x - ray activity may be used to infer a rossby number of 0.54 @xmath16 0.25 ( mh08 ) and lead to the age estimate of 90530 myr for gj 504 .",
    "because the temporal baseline for the x - ray measurement is much shorter than for the multi - decade measurements of @xmath35 , the inferred rossby number is much more uncertain .",
    "therefore , we do not adopt this estimate based on the x - ray emission , although it is consistent with the estimate from other methods .",
    "the strength of lithium absorption lines declines as a star burns its primordial supply of lithium , providing another indicator of stellar youth @xcite .",
    "however , many effects , such as variations in the primordial supply of lithium , the extreme sensitivity of early lithium burning to the stellar accretion history @xcite , and the importance of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance corrections @xcite , make it difficult to obtain a reliable age estimate from lithium abundances .",
    "therefore , we do not employ lithium as an indicator to date gj 504 , but it can provide a clue to the age of gj 504 as discussed below . the equivalent width of li in gj 504 has been measured to be 0.08  , implying a lithium abundance of @xmath39(li ) = @xmath40 + 12 = 2.9 @xcite",
    ". extensive observations of well - dated open clusters @xcite enable a lithium age estimate for gj 504 . at the effective temperature of a g0 star ( @xmath56000 k ) , these cluster estimates can be used to infer an age range of approximately 30500 myr , fully consistent with our gyrochronological and chromospheric age estimates .",
    "gj 504 is not currently identified as a member of any clusters or moving groups ( mgs ) , making it impossible to use population - based age estimators .",
    "the kinematic velocity of gj 504 ( @xmath41=38.6 , @xmath42=1.5 , @xmath43=18.0 ; * ? ? ? * ) is consistent with thin disk stars , thus providing no tight constraint on the age , but remaining consistent with the young age provided by gyrochronology and chromospheric activity .",
    "since stars evolve along mass tracks in an hr - diagram with age , a common age determination method is based on isochronal analysis .",
    "this method can provide reasonable estimates for old stars that have evolved significantly off the main sequence and very young stars that are still undergoing rapid contraction .",
    "however , it is generally not useful for stars near the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , around which stellar evolution proceeds slowly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , generic isochronal estimates in the literature are known to give erroneous ages for young stars by up to two orders of magnitudes .    as illustrative examples , we consider the cases of hd  152555 , hip  10679 , and hd  206860 .",
    "these are all early g - type ( g0g2 ) stars which are members of young mgs , hence they are similar types of stars to gj  504 with well - determined young ages , and thus can be used for comparison to isochronal ages of e.g. , @xcite .",
    "hd  152555 is a member of the ab  dor mg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an age of 50100  myr , whereas @xcite give an age of 4.0  gyr .",
    "hip  10679 is a member of the @xmath44  pic mg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an age of @xmath510  myr , whereas @xcite give an age of 3.0  gyr .",
    "finally , hd  206860 is a member of the her - lya mg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an age of @xmath5200  myr , whereas @xcite give an age of 3.1  gyr .    in light of these large discrepancies ,",
    "it is unsurprising that literature estimates for the isochronal age of gj  504 vary strongly from hundreds of myrs to several gyrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that isochronal analysis should simply be disregarded for a star such as gj  504 , compared to the more reliable age estimators listed above .",
    "nonetheless , since some of the isochronal literature estimates provide gyr - range ages that are seemingly inconsistent with the younger age range we have adopted for gj  504 , we discuss their application to this star in more detail below .",
    "an important limiting factor in isochrone analysis for age determination of an isolated main - sequence star such as gj  504 is the sensitivity to uncertainties in input stellar parameters .",
    "this is in particular true for properties such as effective temperature and surface gravity , where the uncertainties are model - dependent and often tend to be under - estimated in the literature . as an illustration , we consider the isochronal analysis in @xcite based on the yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite , which gives an age of @xmath53  gyr , and appears to be inconsistent with ages of @xmath45500  myr within their quoted error bars .",
    "we have reproduced the analysis of @xcite and confirmed these results with the same methodology and input observables .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ f : isochrones ] .",
    "also plotted in the same figure is the exact same analysis , but using the temperature estimates of gj  504 from @xcite instead ; note that all other values are kept as in @xcite .",
    "this comparison immediately illuminates one of the considerable uncertainties related to isochronal analysis , which is uncertainties in the temperature scaling .",
    "the two temperature estimates in @xcite and @xcite are inconsistent within their quoted error bars , implying that neither error estimate should be trusted when translating this into an error on the age from the isochronal comparison .",
    "moreover , we find that while the temperature estimate of @xcite gives the aforementioned age of @xmath53  gyr and is inconsistent with @xmath45500  myr ages , the temperature estimate of @xcite is fully consistent with these younger ages , and inconsistent with the @xmath53  gyr age .",
    "it is also important to note that due to pre - main sequence evolution , there is some overlap between the isochrones of stars arriving at the main sequence , and those leaving it .",
    "for instance , the 100  myr isochrone overlaps with the 1  gyr isochrone in the relevant temperature range .",
    "hence , while the age is quoted as @xmath51.4  gyr in @xcite which is reproduced in figure [ f : isochrones ] , it can be equally well interpreted as being consistent with our adopted age range , and in fact preferentially supporting the youngest ages .",
    "furthermore , while the temperature and luminosity in @xcite gives a certain age from comparison with the yonsei - yale isochrones , this does not account for the relatively high surface gravity they quote .",
    "we can see this in the second panel of figure [ f : isochrones ] , where again we perform an isochronal analysis , but in surface gravity versus temperature as opposed to luminosity versus temperature . here ,",
    "regardless of which temperature value used , the data are consistent with a @xmath45500  myr age , but inconsistent with a @xmath53  gyr age .",
    "it is instructive to think of these discrepancies in terms of the radius of the star .",
    "if we adopt the @xcite temperature , then the luminosity is high for its mass , implying a large radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface gravity is also high for its mass , implying a small radius .",
    "hence , there is a tension in the radius between the luminosity and surface gravity if the @xcite temperature is adopted , such that no self - consistent picture can be reached by either increasing or decreasing the stellar radius .",
    "by contrast , if we adopt the @xcite temperature , then this tension disappears , and a self - consistent picture can be reached between the temperature , luminosity , and surface gravity  and simultaneously , we get a predicted age which is consistent with the estimates given by the age estimates in the previous sections .",
    "this could therefore be interpreted as supporting the higher temperature of @xcite and thus a younger age .",
    "hence , we note that the isochronal age is readily consistent with gyrochronology and activity , using values for temperature , luminosity , and surface gravity published in the literature .",
    "this is also consistent with the arguably most detailed bayesian isochronal analysis of @xcite , which was a study meant to improve on the analysis of @xcite using the same input data , and which gives an age limit of @xmath1760  myr .",
    "nonetheless , the above discussions imply that it is not feasible to provide age constraints from isochronal dating that are as meaningful nor as stringent as those of gyrochronology and chromospheric activity .",
    "thus , we do not include it in our adopted age range , but merely conclude that it is broadly consistent with such an age .",
    "finally , it can be noted that the existence of a star with such a short rotation period as gj 504 ( @xmath53 days ) would be unprecedented at the gyr - scale ages predicted by some isochrone analyses , such as @xcite .",
    "indeed , although @xcite found an unusually rapid rotator in the @xmath54 gyr old m67 cluster , it has a rotation of approximately half the solar rotation rate ( @xmath46 days ) , which is significantly slower than the rotation of gj 504 . aside from known close spectroscopic binaries , it is the largest known outlier at such an age .",
    "no indications of chromospheric activity corresponding to such rapid rotation have been found among 60 stars in the m67 cluster @xcite , which supports the notion that rapid rotators like gj 504 must be exceedingly rare at ages of a few gyr .      as discussed above",
    ", we adopt the age estimated with gyrochronology as the most likely age ( 160@xmath34 myr ) for gj 504 .",
    "however , we conservatively adopt an age of 160@xmath3 myr , with chromospheric activity providing the upper bound and gyrochronology providing the lower bound .",
    "age indicators based on the lithium abundance , x - ray luminosity , kinematics , and isochrone technique are less precise than gyrochronology and chromospheric activity : in addition , for the li - age estimate it is more difficult to quantify the uncertainty .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to combine those with the age range estimated from the gyrochronological and chromospheric activity techniques , although their estimates are consistent with our adopted age of gj 504 .",
    "future asteroseismology studies , or detailed kinematic studies identifying gj 504 as a member of an mg , may be able to refine our age estimate .",
    "the estimated ages are summarized in table [ table : system_property ] and figure [ fig : f0_age.eps ] .",
    "gj 504 was previously reported to have a stellar companion at a projected separation of about 650 au @xcite , but subsequent observations showed that it does not share a common proper motion ; the gj 504 proper motions are 333.83 @xmath16 0.25 mas yr@xmath12 and 190.24 @xmath16 0.17 mas yr@xmath12 in right ascension and declination @xcite , respectively , while those of the stellar companion candidates are 22.9 @xmath16 11.2 mas yr@xmath12 and 51.7 @xmath16 11.2 mas yr@xmath12 in each direction @xcite .",
    "hence , we identify the stellar companion candidate as an unrelated background star .    the effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity [ fe / h ] of gj 504 were inferred by directly fitting the observed spectrum to the synthetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "interestingly , gj 504 has a super - solar metallicity [ fe / h ] = 0.28 @xcite . in order to estimate the mass of the central star , we use an empirical relation of @xcite , which is a function of the surface gravity , effective temperature , and metallicity of gj 504 @xcite .",
    "the error of the estimate was provided by including uncertainties in the spectroscopically determined input parameters , the reported intrinsic scatter in the relation , and correlations of the best - fit coefficients @xcite . as a result",
    ", the mass of gj 504 is estimated to be 1.22 @xmath16 0.08 solar masses .",

    "the theoretical models infer the mass of gj 504 to be 1.29@xmath47 @xcite or 1.28 @xmath16 0.03 @xmath11 @xcite , overlapping with the empirical estimate .",
    "for our analyses , we employ the mass estimate based on the empirical function for gj 504 .    broad band observations of the infrared excess above the photosphere at 24 @xmath48 and 70 @xmath48 place constraints on the distribution of dust in the inner ( @xmath1 10 au ) and outer disks .",

    "subsequently , we subtracted the thermal background and then used an algorithm @xcite similar to loci in order to further reduce the background .",

    "finally , we applied this average offset to each of the saturated frames .",
    "the rms scatter of the offsets was @xmath56 mas for both observations in 2011 august , and @xmath54 mas for 2012 may .",
    "we adopt these scatters as the registration uncertainties in @xmath31-band data .",
    "we then combined these registered frames .",
    "we detected gj 504 b with an @xmath56 of 3 and 4.3 in the august 12 and august 15 data , respectively .",
    "because the data for 2012 may 25 were obtained with adi , we could use loci for the psf subtraction before stacking the registered data : the loci reduction parameters were set to be the same as the case of hiciao . in the resulting image , the companion was clearly detected with an @xmath56 of 8.0 ( see figure [ fig : f1.eps ] ) .",
    "we measured the position of gj 504 b by fitting two - dimensional elliptical gaussian functions to the final reduced data .",
    "uncertainties in these gaussian centroids range from 2 to 44 mas , and dominate the total uncertainties in the position of gj 504 b. sometimes , loci introduces artificial shifts of the companion positions @xcite .",
    "measuring positions of artificial companions , which have the similar brightness and locations with the gj 504 b , we have investigated how large offsets are added to the positions of gj 504 b. because our adaptation for loci parameters is not aggressive and the planet s separation is sufficiently large from the star ( @xmath58 = 248 ) , the astrometric biases are not large .",
    "the positional measurements are converted to the projected separations and position angles ( p.a.s ) relative to the central star , and all of those are summarized in table [ table : astrometry ] .",
    "then , the uncertainties of measured separations and p.a.s were calculated by including the possible individual error sources of the image registration , distortion correction , plate scale and orientation angle of each camera , and psf - fit for gj 504 b.      we performed aperture photometry on all of our observations of gj 504 b. for hiciao observations of the star gj 504 , we adopted magnitudes of 4.11 , 3.86 , and 3.81 for its @xmath22- , @xmath24- , and @xmath26-band brightness @xcite",
    ". the @xmath31-band brightness of gj 504 was calibrated with a standard star , so that we obtained @xmath31 = 3.94 @xmath16 0.09 mag for gj 504 .",
    "for all photometries of both the primary and the planet , we set the aperture radius to be 1.0 psf fwhm , which ranged from 47 mas in @xmath22 to 100 mas in @xmath31 .    by subtracting a ( local ) linear combination of frames from each image",
    ", loci can artificially reduce the flux of a point source @xcite .",
    "we limit this effect by choosing a relatively large @xmath53 and estimate its magnitude using artificial point sources .",
    "we inject point sources in the hiciao data with projected separations and fluxes similar to those of gj 504 b , measuring their magnitudes before and after applying loci .",
    "we measured flux losses ranging from 13% to 23% for all loci reductions , where the typical scatter for the measurements of flux losses was 5% .",
    "we added this value to the final photometric errors . to verify this result ,",
    "we re - reduced the hiciao data by subtracting a median psf @xcite , but not applying loci .",
    "the resulting fluxes for gj 504 b had larger errors , but were consistent with their values in the final , loci - processed data .",
    "we estimated all of our photometric errors for the companion by calculating the rms scatter of aperture fluxes in blank - sky regions at the separation of gj 504 b. for the @xmath24-band data , these photometric errors were larger than the flux difference between the two sets of observations .",
    "for @xmath24-band observations , the unsaturated frames used to calibrate the companion fluxes were obtained before and after the main science sequences with the mask , while the unsaturated integrations for @xmath22- , @xmath26- , and @xmath31-band were conducted in intervals among the main sequences as well .",
    "the total number of unsaturated frames that were used for photometric calibration was more than 31 for each epoch observation , except in 2011 march .",
    "we measured standard deviations of photometry of the primary using the unsaturated data ; the worst value for the standard deviation was 22% in 2011 march , while these values were less than 12% in all other observations .",
    "we include these variations in the final photometric uncertainties , in addition to the errors of photometry for companion and self - subtraction estimates . for @xmath31-photometry",
    ", we had three sets of images , but did not combine the result of 2012 with those derived from the data obtained in 2011 , because the @xmath56 of the @xmath31 images in 2011 were significantly worse than for the 2012 images ; in the former case , no adi was used and the observing conditions were very poor , with airmasses as high as 3.5 at maximum .",
    "therefore , our adopted value for the @xmath31 photometry is based exclusively on the data obtained in 2012 .",
    "the photometric measurements of gj 504 b at each band are summarized in table [ table : system_property ] , with the @xmath24-band flux computed using the weighted mean of the march and may values .",
    "furthermore , the detection limits estimated from the reduced data are shown in figure [ fig : f3_contrast.eps ] .",
    "to confirm that gj 504 b is gravitationally bound to the host star , we tracked its proper motion over the course of more than a year , from 2011 march through 2012 may ( figure [ fig : f4_astrometry.eps ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : f4_astrometry.eps ] allows to clearly visually distinguish the measured positions from the track expected for a background object .",
    "however , we also carried out a @xmath59 test to derive a statistical confidence that the source is a background star .",
    "this yielded a value of @xmath60 ( 12 dof ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath59 test on the astrometry decisively excludes gj 504 b as an unrelated background source . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume gj 504 b to be an interloping foreground object , its color ( @xmath61 = 3.3 mag ) would rule out a star anyway , leaving only the possibility of a cool brown dwarf ( @xmath62 k ) within a distance of @xmath530 pc . even under optimistic assumptions about the brown dwarf mass function @xcite , less than one such object exists per 10 deg@xmath63 , and the probability of a chance alignment within 3  of gj 504 is no more than 10@xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , in order to demonstrate that the measured motion of gj 504 b relative to its parent star gj 504 is indeed consistent with the expected orbital motion of a gravitationally bound planet , we have fitted a keplerian curve to its measured positions relative to the star , and constrained its orbit ( see appendix ) .",
    "here we assumed that the star has 1.22 @xmath11 .",
    "we show the best - fit curve in figure [ fig : f4_astrometry.eps ] .",
    "the best - fit @xmath59 was derived to be 11.7 ( 8 dog ) , which confirms that the measured positions relative to the central star are consistent with dynamical orbital motion around the star .",
    "these analyses robustly prove that gj 504 and gj 504 b comprise a physically associated system .      using the luminosity and age of gj 504 b , we thus proceed to estimate its mass based on the hot - start model @xcite ( see figure [ fig : f5_hotstart.eps ] ) .",
    "we then calculate a mass by comparing luminosity of gj 504 b at each band to the models , and eventually average the mass estimates at @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath28-bands , which provides a mass of the planet , and its error range , which includes the errors from age and photometry .",
    "any bias in the mass estimate caused by focusing on the photometry in a particular band should be mitigated when taking the average of the photometry of all bands .",
    "for the upper bound , we estimate the mass of gj 504 b from the 1@xmath65 bright end of the photometry at each band , using hot - start models for an age of 510 myr .",
    "the collective upper limit is then acquired by averaging the estimates at each band .",
    "the lower limit is calculated in an equivalent way , using the 1@xmath65 faint end photometry and an age of 100 myr .",
    "likewise , the best estimate uses the mean photometry in each band and an age of 160 myr . as a result of this procedure ,",
    "a mass estimate of 4@xmath4 @xmath8 is derived .",
    "the age uncertainty dominates the errors .",
    "if we adopt the gyrochronological age of 160@xmath34 myr , the most direct of our age indicators , the mass of gj 504 b is constrained to lie between 3 and 5.5 @xmath8 .",
    "this is well below 13.6 @xmath8 , the deuterium - burning threshold commonly used to divide planets and brown dwarfs @xcite and among the lowest masses for exoplanets discovered by direct imaging .",
    "adopting the @xmath26-band luminosity may result in a bias in the mass estimation , since this wavelength range is particularly sensitive to atmospheric parameters such as surface gravity and metallicity @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite predict that raising the metallicity to five times solar metallicity results in a @xmath26-band brightening of a factor of 26 for a planet with temperature and surface gravity values in the range of what is expected for gj 504 b. since the star gj 504 has a metallicity above the solar value , it is very likely that the planet s metallicity is also enhanced . for reference ,",
    "if we neglect the @xmath26-band photometry , the best - fit mass of gj 504 b becomes 3.5 @xmath8 , and is confined to be less than 8 @xmath8 based on the adopted age - range .    the robustness of mass estimates for directly imaged exoplanets is usually limited by theoretical models used to derive age - luminosity relations .",
    "one uncertainty in these relations is the choice of initial conditions , which influences the estimation of a planetary mass . since gj 504 is older than 100 myr , its inferred mass is less sensitive to the uncertainty in initial conditions for the employed model @xcite than the previously imaged planets which have younger age than gj 504 b. to test the sensitivity of the gj 504 b mass to uncertainties in the hot - start model , we compare the near - infrared luminosities of gj 504 b with a suite of models with ages between 100 and 510 myr , initial thermal states ranging from hot to extremely cold ( initial specific entropies from 8.0 to 1213 @xmath66 baryon@xmath12 ) , masses between 1 and 20 @xmath8 , varying cloud properties , and metallicities between one and three times the solar value @xcite . even when adopting an age of 100 myr , for which the largest differences arise between the hottest- and coldest - start models , the difference in the mass estimates between the two cases is typically @xmath54 @xmath67 , which is calculated as the median of all estimates for each different model atmosphere and each band ( see figure [ fig : hot_cold_comparison_v1.eps ] ) . at older ages ,",
    "the difference decreases even further .",
    "by contrast , if we use hr 8799 b ( 2050 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as an example of planets younger than 50 myr , the corresponding difference is higher than 10 @xmath8 , which is significantly larger than the case of gj 504 b. thus , in quantitative terms , the dependency on initial conditions for gj 504 b is indeed rather week .",
    "this also allows to confine the mass of gj 504 b to within the planetary mass regime , essentially regardless of initial conditions ( see figure [ fig : f6_cold14mjup.eps ] ) .",
    "the mass inferred from each of the @xmath22- , @xmath24- , and @xmath31-bands individually is practically always below the deuterium burning limit of @xmath514 @xmath8 , apart from the most extreme cases in which both the coldest initial conditions and ages near the oldest end of the age range are adopted simultaneously .",
    "note that these extreme cold - start models may be unrealistic for giant planets @xcite .",
    "here , we discuss the unique properties of gj 504 b through comparison with other imaged planets . furthermore , the possible origin of gj 504 is discussed .",

    "@xmath11 ) , but a robust second epoch confirmation still needs to be acquired @xcite .",

    "* ) . among these , 1rxs j1609 b @xcite orbits a pre - main sequence solar - mass star at a wide separation of 330 au .    for all the aforementioned companions , their masses",
    "have been inferred from comparisons of their infrared luminosity with hot - start models . however , due to the youth of those systems , they are highly affected by hot- versus cold - start conditions .",
    "the cold - start models imply that even hr 8799 b , which may have the lowest masses among them , would be more massive than @xmath514 @xmath8 ( see figure [ fig : f6_cold14mjup.eps ] ) : its mass is estimated to be @xmath520 @xmath8 or higher ( except at @xmath22-band ) . therefore , under cold - start assumptions , all the exoplanets around these young stars have much higher masses than currently inferred , and are pushed into the brown dwarf mass regime ( @xmath6814 @xmath8 ) .",
    "one special case is the candidate around fomalhaut , for which a mass below 3 @xmath8 has been reported , but deep infrared non - detections indicate that the detected light from the candidate can not arise from a planetary surface @xcite ; hence , its physical nature remains unclear .",
    "regardless of the caution for the hot - start models , a few independent constraints , such as dynamical stability analysis in the case of the hr 8799 system ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest that the hot - start models may be realistic .",
    "as discussed above , the mass estimates for directly - imaged planets suffer from uncertainties of cooling models for giant planets until future calibrations may be obtained by comparing model - dependent masses with improved dynamical mass estimates . however , due to its old age , gj 504 b is less dependent on the models uncertainty related to the hot versus cold conditions , compared with previously imaged planets .",
    "we can compare the magnitudes and colors of gj 504 b to similar objects in the literature in order to get a sense of the physical properties of this planet .",
    "for this purpose , it has been placed on color ",
    "magnitude diagrams ( figure [ fig : f7_cmd.eps ] ) along with lt - type field brown dwarfs @xcite and hr 8799 bcde @xcite , kappa and b @xcite , 1rxs j1609 b @xcite , 2 m 1207 b @xcite , and gj 758 b @xcite .    given the location of gj 504 b in the color - magnitude diagrams , it is clear that it is much colder than previous planet detections . indeed ,",
    "an application of @xmath69 luminosities of gj 504 b to those predicted by the cooling models of @xcite implies an effective temperature of 510@xmath6 k for the planet , where we estimated the best estimate and lower / upper limits in the same way as for the mass estimate of gj 504 b ( see section [ section : mass estimate ] ) .",
    "the inferred effective temperature is significantly colder than the values of 8001800 k inferred for previously imaged planets @xcite .",
    "the extrasolar giant planets other than gj 504 are primarily located around the so - called lt transition , which corresponds to the transition from cloudy ( l - type ) to clear ( t - type ) atmospheres .",
    "gj 504 b is consistent with having a largely clear atmosphere analogous to the bottom of the t - type sequence , or the top of the yet colder y - type sequence .",
    "it deviates from this sequence in @xmath70 , due to overluminosity in @xmath26-band , which is probably due to a low surface gravity or enrichment in heavy elements , both of which can reproduce such an effect @xcite .",
    "these factors have been shown to possibly explain the same trend seen in gj 758 b @xcite , which is an older and more massive companion to a sun - like star .",
    "we note that gj 504 b was observed with the @xmath26-band filter and gj 758 b with the @xmath71-band filter , which prevents a one - to - one comparison .",
    "however , models incorporating heavy element enrichment appear to be a promising option for reproducing the full set of magnitudes of gj 504 b.    it has been proposed that planetary candidates with hot atmospheres ( @xmath15 @xmath72 k ) around hr 8799 or 2 m 1207 may have thick clouds @xcite although their cloud properties are under discussion @xcite . by contrast , the relatively blue @xmath73 (= 0.23 ) color of gj 504 b is consistent with t - type brown dwarfs in the same temperature range @xcite , which are representative of less cloudy atmospheres that could occur naturally in this temperature range @xcite .",
    "in addition , models examining cloud clearing as a function of temperature and surface gravity in @xcite do predict that a temperature of @xmath5500 k and @xmath17 of @xmath54 , as expected for gj 504 b ( see table [ table : system_property ] ) , should lead to a clear atmosphere , while the properties of previously imaged planets place them in a cloudy regime .",
    "the cold and perhaps less cloudy atmosphere of gj 504 b thus places it in a physically distinct state from the hotter and cloudier atmospheres of previously imaged planets , and should be highly interesting for further atmospheric studies in the future .",
    "these properties imply that gj 504 b will become a benchmark object for the study of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "gj 504 b is a giant planet that lies at a projected separation of 43.5 au .",
    "two major scenarios could explain its formation : the core - accretion ( ca ) model @xcite and the gravitational instability ( gi ) model @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss whether the ca or gi can account for the origin of gj 504 b.      in the ca model , the core of a giant planet accretes planetesimals and grows to a critical mass ( @xmath510 earth masses ) , at which point the core begins to rapidly accrete gas directly from the protoplanetary disk .",
    "it is difficult for the ca model to explain the formation of giant planets in situ beyond 30 au .",
    "a recent study @xcite suggested that even a locally stable ( but globally unstable ) disk with an order of magnitude higher mass than the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite around a g - type star like gj 504 was unable , in simulations , to form giant planets beyond 30 au within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of gj 504 b , as well as other directly - imaged planets such as hr 8799 bcde , remains a particular challenge for the conventional ca theory . in this implication",
    ", we should note such numerical investigations as conduced by @xcite have typically neglected some theoretical processes that may enable the cores of giant planets to grow in the shorter timescale : effective damping of small planetesimal s eccentricity due to gas drag @xcite or efficient capture of planetesimals due to atmospheric drag @xcite may accelerate the accumulations of planetesimals in such the outer region , so that the in situ formation of gj 504 b may become possible @xcite .",
    "however , even the models incorporating these processes may not necessarily be promising for producing a planet more massive than the critical mass beyond 30 au at least for disks that are not particularly massive , as demonstrated by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "even if the in situ formation of a giant planet is difficult in such outer regions , models incorporating planet scattering can account for the origin of gj 504 b. if multiple planets are formed by ca in the inner regions , one or more of them could be scattered outward due to dynamical interactions among the planets @xcite or between the planets and the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "gj 504 b may have been pushed outward by as - yet undiscovered companions .",
    "multiple giant planets may be common in metal - rich protoplanetary disks @xcite , because the high metallicity may enhance solid materials and planetesimals in their protoplanetary disks , resulting in rapid growth of planetary cores .",
    "eventually , outward migration may frequently occur in the metal - rich systems .",
    "hence , the relatively high metallicity of gj 504 system ( see table . [",
    "table : system_property ] ) may be a preferential property to explain the origin of gj 504 b under the outward migration hypothesis .",
    "in contrast to ca , the gi model can form massive planets in situ at large radii . in this model ,",
    "a massive protoplanetary disk becomes gravitationally unstable in its outer regions ( @xmath0 @xmath550 au ) as the cooling time becomes short relative to the local dynamical timescale @xcite .",
    "the outer disk then fragments , collapsing directly into one or more giant planets .",
    "the instability can also occur between 20 and 50 au , with continuous inflows of gas into the magnetically inactive region inducing fragmentation on a timescale of @xmath510@xmath74 yr @xcite .",
    "however , the planet would have to escape the very rapid inward migration expected in a turbulent disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , if multiple massive planets are formed in the gi disk , they would still be scattered and eventually ejected from the systems , as in the case of ca .",
    "therefore , gj 504 b would be a planet surviving against falling onto the central star or ejections form the system , if it was formed through the gi process .",
    "we should note that fragmentation could also be suppressed in a metal - rich disk like that expected for gj 504 ; such a disk would cool less efficiently due to the higher opacities @xcite .",
    "also , the significant gas accretion onto a clump formed according to the gi process may prevent the planet from remaining less massive @xcite , disallowing the occurrence of a low - mass planet like gj 504 b.      based on the available data , we can not conclusively determine which process led to the formation of gj 504 b. however , it is interesting to note that gj 504 b is the first wide - orbit giant planet detected around a demonstrably metal - rich star .",
    "as discussed above , the high metallicity may enhance massive planetary cores , while preventing the effective cooling of a protoplanetary disk , and thus be more hospitable for ca formation than gi formation .",
    "thus , given these measurable properties , planets such as gj 504 b may provide important clues for understanding the formation and evolution of giant planets .    for clarifying the origin of gj 504 b",
    ", the further observations may be crucial .",
    "intriguingly , the ca model suggests the presence of unseen massive planets at smaller angular separations @xcite , making gj 504 an outstanding candidate for follow - up observations by current and future instruments .",
    "@xmath75-body simulations for the dynamically unstable gas - free planetary system predict that such inner companions should orbit at a few au from the host and have masses equal or greater than the corresponding outer planets @xcite .",
    "therefore , the inner counterpart for gj 504 b would have to be more massive than @xmath54 @xmath8 if it exists , although we note that radial velocity observations have found few planets in this mass range at semimajor axes of a few au @xcite and the remaining gasses in the disk may affect the scattering of planets , changing the configurations of planets predicted by the simulations for the gas - free cases @xcite .",
    "also , further monitoring of the orbit may be important , since scattered planets preferentially have high eccentricities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , modeling the atmosphere of gj 504 b may provide another piece of evidence to test whether it was produced by the ca process .",
    "the enhancement of heavy elements in the planetary atmosphere is a natural outcome of the ca process @xcite .",
    "it is possible to examine the abundances of such elements in the spectral energy distribution of gj 504 b through the use of atmospheric models . for this purpose ,",
    "multiple wavelength photometric observations as well as the spectroscopy can play an important role .",
    "further observations of the gj 504 system will constrain the origin of gj 504 b and may lead to a better understanding of the origin of planetary systems , including our solar system .",
    "future instruments with direct ( e.g. , gpi , sphere , scexao ) or indirect ( e.g. , ird ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) techniques that can explore more inner region may be able to find a promising evidence to clarify the origin of gj 504 b.",
    "as part of the seeds direct - imaging survey , we have detected a giant planet around the sun - like star gj 504 .",
    "the star has a spectral type of g0 and an approximate mass of 1.2 @xmath11 .",
    "its age has been conservatively estimated as 160@xmath3 myr based on a combination of gyrochronology and chromospheric activity .",
    "gyrochronology alone , which is the most direct and likely the most reliable age estimator , places the age at the lower end of this range , at 160@xmath34 myr .",
    "observations over one year baseline provided confirmation that the detected planet is orbiting the star . compared with previously imaged exoplanets , gj 504 b has a number of interesting features .    1 .",
    "the age of this planet is the oldest among all directly imaged planets . 2 .",
    "its mass is estimated to be 4@xmath4 @xmath8 .",
    "this is among the least massive of imaged exoplanets . because of its old age ,",
    "the mass estimate is less dependent , compared to other imaged exoplanets , on the uncertainties of initial conditions in models used to convert its infrared luminosity into a mass .",
    "gj 504 b is the first imaged giant planet on a wide orbit ( @xmath0 5 au ) around a g - type main - sequence star with a mass near the solar mass .",
    "4 .   the planet s projected separation from the primary is about 43.5 au , which is comparable to the widest - orbit planets around massive stars such as hr 8799 .",
    "the effective temperature of the planet ( 510@xmath6 k ) is the coldest among all previously detected giant planets .",
    "the blue @xmath73 color of 0.23 suggests that it has a less cloudy atmosphere than other imaged exoplanets .",
    "the cold temperature and color place the planet in a novel parameter space of atmospheres for exoplanets . 7 .",
    "gj 504 b is the first giant planet on a wide orbit discovered around a demonstrably metal - rich star .",
    "the performed observations alone can not conclusively uncover the origin of gj 504 b. further observations of this system will enable more direct comparisons with our own solar system , and will help unveil the formation history of giant planets in the outer disk .",
