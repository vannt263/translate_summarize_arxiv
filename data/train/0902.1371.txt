    "this indicates that @xmath190 for @xmath43 is about four times as large as that for @xmath102 . because the @xmath6 vector is assumed to be parallel to the @xmath76 plane , as discussed in section ii , the magnitude of @xmath191 for @xmath102 should be larger than that for @xmath43 .",
    "thus , @xmath192 for @xmath102 is considerably smaller than that for @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that the staggered fields due to the dm interaction and the staggered @xmath61 tensor , @xmath85 and @xmath193 , respectively , are roughly parallel for @xmath43 , while for @xmath102 , they are roughly orthogonal . +",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the results of the magnetic susceptibility and the high - frequency , high - field esr measurements on @xmath0 afhc kcugaf@xmath1 with the large exchange interaction @xmath2 k. in kcugaf@xmath1 , the staggered magnetic field @xmath194 is induced perpendicular to the external magnetic field @xmath62 owing to the dm interaction with alternating @xmath195 vectors and the staggered @xmath5 tensor .",
    "thus , the present system can be represented by the quantum sg model in a magnetic field . in esr measurement , we observed the soliton resonance @xmath155 and the breathers @xmath156 up to the third order , which are main elementary excitations characteristic of the quantum sg model .",
    "we also observed the interbreather transitions @xmath179 , the multiple excitations of the soliton resonance and the breather @xmath185 and two - breather excitation @xmath180 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : esr_diagram2 ] , their resonance conditions for four different field directions were beautifully described by the quantum sg field theory with only the adjustable parameter @xmath7 listed in table [ table : cs ] .",
    "the proportional coefficient @xmath8 varies widely , @xmath196 , depending on the field direction .",
    "kcugaf@xmath1 differs from other quantum sg systems in its large exchange interaction and wide range of the proportional coefficient .",
    "it was shown from the present measurements that the curie term @xmath197 in the magnetic susceptibility is not necessarily proportional to @xmath189 .",
    "this is because the curie term arises from the dm interaction but not from the staggered @xmath5 tensor .",
    "+    we express our sincere thanks to r. morisaki for her contribution to the early stage of the present study and to m. oshikawa and t. hikihara for fruitful discussions and comments .",
