    "a fundamental feature of any uniform bose system with arbitrarily strong interactions is the appearance , at low temperatures , of a bose - einstein condensate and , simultaneously , of superfluidity . in these systems , the condensate fraction , @xmath2 , and the superfluid fraction , @xmath3 , always coexist , both being nonzero below the condensation temperature .",

    "this is because each pore represents an external local potential . at the same time , since pores enjoy random properties , being of different sizes , shapes , and being randomly distributed in space , they do form for a bose system a kind of a spatially random potential  @xcite .",

    "one has the phase of unbroken gauge symmetry , where @xmath181 , while @xmath182 .",
    "the limit of @xmath175 , for @xmath130 tending to infinity , is @xmath183 .",
    "the phase transition caused by the increasing disorder is an example of a quantum phase transition .",
    "a detailed analysis of the properties of a bose - condensed system at zero temperature in an external random potential has been presented .",
    "the disorder potential is modelled by the gaussian uncorrelated disorder .",
    "the strength of disorder as well as the strength of interactions can be arbitrary .",
    "the system contains several fractions of particles , the condensate fraction @xmath2 , superfluid fraction @xmath3 , normal fraction @xmath10 , anomalous fraction @xmath12 , and the fraction of a glassy component @xmath11 .",
    "the behavior of these fractions as functions of the gas parameter and the disorder parameter was investigated .",
    "the ideal bose - condensed gas is stochastically unstable , since any infinitesimally weak disorder destroys it , transferring it to the normal state .",
    "finite interactions stabilize the system .",
    "increasing disorder leads to a first - order phase transition between the superfluid and normal phases . at asymptotically weak disorder , such that @xmath148 , the superfluid fraction is always larger than the condensate fraction , @xmath165 . but increasing disorder , under very weak interactions , can invert the latter inequality , when the superfluid fraction becomes lower than the condensate fraction , @xmath169 .",
    "this is in agreement with the monte carlos simulations  @xcite , where it was noticed that sufficiently strong disorder can suppress the superfluid fraction making it smaller than the condensate fraction , provided that interaction strengths are very weak .",
    "however , at sufficiently strong interactions , the superfluid fraction gets larger than the condensate fraction for all disorder parameters below the phase transition point @xmath167 . to our knowledge",
    ", no numerical simulations have been accomplished , when both the disorder as well as interaction strengths would be strong .",
    "the superfluid and condensate fractions were found always to coexist .",
    "it may occur that @xmath184 or @xmath168 , but they are nonzero or zero simultaneously .",
    "there is no pure bose glass phase , when @xmath3 would be zero , while @xmath2 is nonzero , though the glassy fraction @xmath11 , induced by disorder , is always present .",
    "although disorder suppresses superfluidity , @xmath3 never becomes exactly zero , as one might conclude from the calculations for asymptotically weak disorder  @xcite .",
    "the pure bose glass phase does not occur in the considered model .",
    "the unusual effect of _ antidepletion _ was found , when increasing interactions can increase the condensate fraction in the presence of disorder.this effect is caused by the competition between the disorder destabilizing the system and the interactions , which stabilize the latter . as a result ,",
    "in the presence of disorder , the condensate fraction becomes a nonmonotonic function of the interaction strength .",
    "the change in the behavior of the condensed fraction @xmath2 , normal fraction @xmath10 , glassy fraction @xmath11 , and the superfluid fraction @xmath3 results from a competition between the interaction potential and the external random potential .",
    "these two causes act on the fractions in a different way .",
    "the increasing interaction always depletes the condensate , but increases the superfluid fraction . by depleting the condensate ,",
    "the interaction increases the normal fraction @xmath10 . at the same time",
    ", strengthening disorder increases the glassy fraction and depletes the condensate .",
    "the competition of all of these , sometimes contradictory , governs the overall behaviour of the fractions .",
    "the origin of the phase transition , occurring under the increasing disorder , can be understood as follows .",
    "recall that the ideal bose - condensed gas is absolutely unstable with respect to any infinitesimally weak random perturbations  @xcite .",
    "finite interactions do stabilize the bose - condensed gas .",
    "but this stabilization can survive only until a finite strength of disorder , when again the system loses stability and transforms to the state where the gauge symmetry is not broken .",
    "the point is that disorder destroys coherence that is pertinent to bose - einstein condensation . by destroying coherence",
    ", disorder moves the system to a state with no bose condensate .",
    "the calculations in this paper have been done only for zero temperature .",
    "this is because , first , it has been necessary to understand the behaviour of the system under two varying parameters , the interaction strength @xmath130 and the strength of disorder @xmath129 .",
    "including temperature makes the problem dependent on three parameters .",
    "this would essentially complicate the consideration making it necessary to resort to mainly numerical calculations .",
    "we plan to present the details of these calculations in our future work .",
    "but for low temperatures , the obtained results still do hold .",
    "including temperature just leads to more condensate depletion and enhancement of the normal fraction .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that when analyzing the behaviour of the fractions , we always keep in mind the normalization condition ( 60 ) , according to which the condensate fraction @xmath2 , normal fraction @xmath10 , and the glassy fraction @xmath11 are added to @xmath9 .",
    "however , the explicit relation between the condensate and superfluid fractions is not known , because of which the latter does not enter any simple normalization condition , except that @xmath185 .    in conclusion , it is important to discuss the possibility of experimental observation of the effects described in the present paper .",
    "standard experiments are accomplished with trapped atoms .",
    "the inclusion of a trapping potential in our theory would complicate numerical investigation . however , there are two cases , when the results of our consideration could be directly applicable to experiments .",
    "first , the homogeneous picture provides a reasonable approximation for wide traps , and , second , it gives a good description of the situation at the center of a trap , even if the trap edges are rather sharp .",
    "this becomes possible because of the known fact that the local - density approximation allows for a quite accurate description of trapped atoms  @xcite , and the uniform case serves as a starting point for the local - density approximation .",
    "keeping in mind the local - density approximation , when close to the trap center the system is almost uniform , we must deal with the gas of atoms with the positive scattering length , since a homogeneous gas with attraction is known to be unstable  @xcite . in experiment",
    ", one can also realize bose - einstein condensation of atoms with negative scattering length , provided that the atoms are trapped and their number does not exceed the critical value @xmath186 .",
    "a simple formula for the critical number @xmath186 , giving rather accurate estimates for harmonic traps can be represented  @xcite as @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the oscillator length in the @xmath189-direction and the @xmath21 scattering length .",
    "a trapped atomic cloud , with a negative scattering length , can be stable only when @xmath190 .",
    "this case requires a separate investigation . in the present paper , we have considered a large system with the number of atoms not bounded from above .",
    "this is why we have assumed from the beginning that the scattering length is positive .",
    "the value of the scattering length can be varied in a wide range , for instance , by means of the feshbach resonance techniques  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to check in experiment the behavior of the system in a fixed random potential , when the interaction strength is varied .",
    "such a situation would correspond to fig .",
    "when diminishing the scattering length , that is , diminishing the gas parameter @xmath130 , we would come to the boundary of stability of the system . recall that , in the absence of interactions , the bose - condensed system is stochastically unstable , such that any weak random potential destroys the condensate .",
    "this phenomenon of stochastic instability was analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to understand ,",
    "why this phenomenon occurs , it is sufficient to remember that the ideal uniform bose - condensed gas is unstable even in the absence of any random potential , which can be easily demonstrated by calculating the system compressibility and finding out that the latter diverges in the absence of interactions  @xcite .",
    "finally , the random potential of the type similar to that considered in the present paper can be created in experiment , e.g. , by employing the optical speckle techniques@xcite .",
    "these techniques allow for an efficient regulation of the properties of the formed random potential .",
    "it is possible to organize a frozen random distribution , independent from the time variable .",
    "it is also feasible to regulate the correlation length characterizing the spatial properties of the speckle randomness .",
    "when the correlation length is much smaller than the healing length , the effective random potential can be represented as being @xmath99-correlated , which has been assumed in the present paper . at the same time , we recall that the general theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is applicable to random potentials with arbitrary correlation length , although for finite - length correlations , calculations would be essentially more complicated . in this way",
    ", it looks quite feasible to check the predictions of the suggested approach in experiments with atomic bose gases confined in wide traps ."
