    "small deviation problems ( also called small ball problems or lower tail probability problems ) were studied intensively during recent years , which is due to many connections to other subjects such as the functional law of the iterated logarithm of chung type , strong limit laws in statistics , metric entropy properties of linear operators , quantization , and several other approximation quantities for stochastic processes . for a detailed account",
