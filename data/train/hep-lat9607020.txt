    "in a recent paper  @xcite ( henceforth referred as i ) we proposed a new method that allows to evaluate the gauge invariant effective action for external background fields in lattice gauge theories . in i",
    "we considered the so - called lattice schrdinger functional  @xcite : @xmath0 =    \\langle   \\vec{a}^{\\text{ext } } |   \\exp(-ht ) { \\mathcal{p } } |   \\vec{a}^{\\text{ext } } \\rangle   \\ , = \\int { \\mathcal{d}}u \\exp(-s_w)\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the standard wilson action . in equation",
    "we integrate over the links @xmath2 with the constraints @xmath3 where @xmath4 the lattice effective action for the background field @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6 = -\\frac{1}{t }   \\ln \\left\\ { \\frac{{\\mathcal{z}}[u^{\\text{ext}}]}{{\\mathcal{z}}(0 ) } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the extension in the euclidean time . in the continuum where @xmath8 it is easy to show that @xmath9 $ ] reduces to the vacuum energy in presence of the background field @xmath5 .",
    "note that our effective action is by definition gauge invariant .",
    "moreover the effective action   can be used for a non - perturbative investigation of the properties of the quantum vacuum .",
    "in i we considered the four - dimensional u(1 ) lattice gauge theory in an external constant magnetic field : @xmath10 the lattice links corresponding to the vector potential   are @xmath11   = \\cos(agbx_1 ) + i \\sin(agbx_1 ) \\,,\\\\",
    "u^{\\text{ext}}_1(x ) =   u^{\\text{ext}}_3(x ) = u^{\\text{ext}}_4(x ) =   1 \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , due to the periodic boundary conditions , we have @xmath12 with @xmath13 an integer , and @xmath14 the lattice extension in the @xmath15 direction ( in lattice units ) .    due to the gauge invariance",
    "the effective action only depends on the constant field strength @xmath16 .",
    "thus we consider the density of the effective action @xmath17 = \\frac{\\gamma\\left [ \\vec{a}^{\\text{ext } } \\right]}{v}= -\\frac{1}{\\omega } \\ln \\left [   \\frac{{\\mathcal{z}}[u^{\\text{ext}}]}{{\\mathcal{z}}(0 ) } \\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the lattice spatial volume . in order to avoid the problem of computing a partition function ,",
    "we focused on the derivative of @xmath20 $ ] with respect to @xmath21 : @xmath22 =   \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\sum_{x,\\mu>\\nu } \\cos \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\right\\rangle_0 - \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\sum_{x,\\mu>\\nu } \\cos \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\right\\rangle_{a^{\\text{ext } } } \\,.\\ ] ] from our previous discussion it is clear that @xmath23 $ ] is the vacuum energy density .",
    "thus we expect that @xmath24 $ ] behaves like a specific heat .",
    "indeed , in i we found that , near the critical region @xmath25 , @xmath24 $ ] displays a maximum which increases by increasing the lattice volume .",
    "in addition , the peak shrinks and shift towards @xmath26 by increasing @xmath27 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the critical parameters by applying the standard finite size scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "consider a finite system with effective linear dimension @xmath28 .",
    "in general the thermodynamical quantities depend on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the correlation length and @xmath32 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the finite size scaling hypothesis assumes that near the critical point the microscopic length @xmath32 drops out .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the generalized susceptibility @xmath33 .",
    "in a infinite system near the critical point we have @xmath34 in the finite geometry with size @xmath28 , according to the finite size scaling hypothesis , we can write @xmath35 where the scaling function @xmath36 is smooth . now , from @xmath37 it follows @xmath38 where @xmath39 is another smooth scaling function . on a finite system @xmath33",
    "is supposed to be analytic in @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath39 must be a smooth function with a peak at some value @xmath40 .",
    "near the peak we parametrize @xmath39 as : @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 positive constants .    from equations  ( [ eq12 ] ) and  ( [ eq13 ] )",
    "we obtain easily : @xmath45 ^ 2 + 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 then , if we plot the susceptibility versus the temperature , we see a peak at @xmath47 with a width @xmath48 and height @xmath49 .",
    "further , the critical exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related by the so - called hyperscaling  @xcite relation  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "equation   implies that @xmath54 these considerations can be directly applied to our generalized susceptibility @xmath55 $ ] . in order to determine the critical parameters we need to simulate our gauge system on lattices with different sizes .",
    "however we must take fixed the external magnetic field , for @xmath24 $ ] depends even on @xmath56 .",
    "thus , according to eq .  , we must work with @xmath14 and @xmath13 fixed . as a consequence we perform the numerical simulations on lattices with sizes @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the contributions to @xmath60 $ ] due to the frozen time slice at @xmath61 and to the fixed boundary conditions at the lattice spatial boundaries must be subtracted .",
    "indeed , the physically relevant quantity is due to the `` internal '' links , i.e. only the dynamical links must be taken into account in evaluating @xmath62 $ ] . in figure  1",
    "we display the derivative of the internal energy @xmath62 $ ] versus @xmath21 for the @xmath63 lattice .",
    "note that in the strong coupling region @xmath64 @xmath62 $ ] vanishes so that the density of the effective action can be recovered by integrating over @xmath21 without any subtraction .    in figure",
    "2 we show @xmath62 $ ] near the critical region for the different lattice sizes .",
    "we try a fit of the peak according to eq .",
    ": @xmath65 = \\frac{a_1(l_{\\text{eff}})}{a_2(l_{\\text{eff } } )   [ \\beta - \\beta^{*}(l_{\\text{eff}})]^2 + 1}\\ ] ] where the effective size of the lattice is  @xcite @xmath66 in equation   @xmath67 is the internal lattice volume , i.e. the volume occupied by the dynamical lattice sites .",
    "if we denote by @xmath68 the lattice sites whose links are fixed according to eq .",
    ", thus we get : @xmath69 where the first term is the volume of the frozen time slice @xmath61 while the second term is due to the fixed links at the lattice spatial boundaries . whereupon we have :",
    "@xmath70 it turns out that our lattice data are in satisfying agreement with eq .  .",
    "indeed near the pseudocritical coupling we fit the data according to eq .   by means of the standard minuit subroutine of the cern library .",
    "we find rather good fits ( solid lines in fig .",
    "2 ) with @xmath71 . as a result of the fits we get the values of the three parameters for the five different values of @xmath72 . according to the finite size scaling hypothesis @xmath73 should behave as @xmath74 in figure  3 we report @xmath73 versus @xmath72 together with the result of the fit eq .  .",
    "we find @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the pseudocritical couplings are fitted according to eq .",
    ": @xmath77 we find ( see fig .",
    "4 ) : @xmath78 with @xmath79 . the values eqs .   and   for the critical exponent are quite consistent with the hyperscaling relation eq .  .",
    "indeed from eqs .",
    "and   we find @xmath80 which is compatible with eq .   within two standard deviations .    finally , in fig .",
    "5 we check that the universality law in the critical region : @xmath81 = \\tilde{\\phi } \\left [ l_{\\text{eff}}^{1/\\nu}(\\beta-\\beta_c ) \\right]\\ ] ] holds quite well for the lattices with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 respectively .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our extimation of the infinite volume critical coupling is in perfect agreement with the values extracted from the specific heat  @xcite .",
    "however it is well established that on lattices with periodic boundary conditions , the u(1 ) phase transition is exhibiting a weakly first - order nature  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our data are consistent with a continuous phase transition . as a matter of fact",
    ", it turns out that the phase transition of compact u(1 ) pure lattice gauge theory with the wilson action on lattices with closed topology  @xcite or with fixed boundary conditions  @xcite is continuous .",
    "moreover our extimation of the critical exponents is consistent with the results of ref .",
