    "quantum entanglement plays a central role in quantum information and quantum computation.@xcite though the theoretical investigations of the magnetism and electronic structure of lanthanides have been performed decades ago at the same time fundamental results of the time dependent spin structure appear under a new light how a molecular spintronics.@xcite quantum entanglement ( qe ) also exists on the nanoscale in solid state and molecular systems.@xcite condensed matter systems are especially interesting subjects for studying entanglement , f.e .",
    "entanglement of spins , for several reasons .",
    "first and foremost , condensed matter is the basis of a sizeable portion of todays research and development in spintronics and in- formation industries .",
    "understanding qe in solids and nanostructures could open a complete new perspective on those research directions .",
    "moreover , the source of qe of spin states is the exchange interaction , which is known to be strong in condensed matter systems.@xcite in the case of solids and molecules , however , detecting qe can be tricky .",
    "key challenges in building a quantum computer from spin qubits in physical systems are preparation of arbitrary spin states , implementation of the arbitrary qubit evolution , reading out the qubit states , overcoming of the decoherence and doing all this on a large scale ; that is , with a large number of qubits or a spin system of n - qubits ( ssnq ) with the definite spin structure.@xcite for the purposes of implementing quantum computation , the physical system can be treated as a ssnq in which the couplings between the qubits can be controlled externally .",
    "the concept of a ssnq can be related to the problem of the quantum spin structure , where the nontrivial applications may exist for computers with a limited number n of a qubits .",
    "the precise relationship between the type of the entanglement and the distribution of the coupling strengths in the ssnq can be strongly dependent on external parameters , such as applied magnetic pulse fields . in this context",
    ", systematic studies of the relationship between the quantity and nature of the entanglement and the spin structure of the ssnq via magnetic pulse has been pursued in order to identify the optimal spin structures to create specific types of the entanglements .",
    "here we use the spin correlating states@xcite to study entanglement in metallic clusters of gd trimers in @xmath0 endohedral metallofullerene on a cu(001 ) surface@xcite .",
    "the relevance of the @xmath0 molecular magnet under a magnetic pulses to be considered for qubits perspectives will be discussed in this paper . for this purpose",
    "the time - dependent spin dynamics is involved within a micromagnetic model based on the general spin hamiltonian ( gsh ) formalism , where the spin is considered as a spatial and time - dependent continuous function . in this case",
    "the dynamics of spins obeys the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite , involving the various energy contributions from the exchange , magnetostatic and zeeman interactions , and magnetic anisotropy of the spin system .",
    "it is known , that correlations are of a great importance in the study of spin systems .",
    "they are directly related to the entanglement between different atomic spins , which can be employed in the field of quantum information processing .",
    "therefore entanglement arising in the correlated quantum spin systems has become one of the most widely investigated phenomenon in quantum physics during last years .",
    "now it is well known how to create entanglement in quantum spin systems , but how it propagates inside a system is still an important fundamental question in quantum information theory .",
    "therefore the theoretical descriptions of the time - dependent properties of the correlated quantum spin systems is very important nowdays .",
    "recently it was claimed , that the controlled and manipulated entanglement in the quantum spin systems could be realized precisely and effectively by means of the required dynamical operations in presence of the magnetic pulse.@xcite moreover , it was shown also that the solid state spin - based system with a definite spin structure can be considered as a spin system of n - qubits , which demonstrates the prolonged time of the decogerence demanded for quantum information processing . for implementation of quantum computation",
    "one can treat a quantum spin system as a ssnq , where the couplings between the spin qubits can be controlled externally , for instance by the applied magnetic pulse .",
    "therefore the systematic studies of inherent relationship between the strength of the entanglement and the peculiarities of spin structure of a ssnq are carried out in order to find the optimal time- dependent spin structures with specific types of the controlled and engineered entanglements .",
    "the dynamic behavior of a spin is determined by the equation of motion , which can be derived from the quantum theory with the spin hamiltonian @xmath1 that calculated the spin structure of a magnetic cluster with hamiltonian @xmath2 the first term @xmath3 is the heisenberg hamiltonian , which represents the isotropic exchange interaction , @xmath4 is the exchange hamiltonian the term due to the axial single - ion anisotropy , and @xmath5 is the interaction between the spin system and the external magnetic field .",
    "this hamiltonian , which describes the interaction of the spin @xmath6 with the external magnetic field , given by its flux @xmath7 , can be expressed as : @xmath8 where the effective magnetic field @xmath7 is an external magnetic field @xmath9 , the anisotropy fields @xmath10 , the exchange interaction @xmath11 and external magnetic pulse field @xmath12 .",
    "here we use the approximation for @xmath13 with replacement @xmath14 .",
    "use @xcite we obtain that @xmath15 the effective magnetic field @xmath16 is given by the free magnetic energy variational with magnetization : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the free energy of the magnetic nanosystem .",
    "the effective field @xmath16 can be derived from the free energy functional @xmath19 we have derived a general form of the time - dependend spin equation for a system of the spins precessing in an effective magnetic field with specifying the interactions in the magnetic cluster on a surface .",
    "a spin structure is defined only proceeding from the spin model of a cluster .",
    "here we use to calculate a spin structure by the ito method within the generalized spin hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "since in further researches the anisotropic part of a cluster will be only scalar , the magnetic properties of the anisotropic system do not depend on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "thus we can consider the external magnetic field @xmath20 directed along arbitrary axis @xmath21 of the cluster coordinate frame that is chosen as a spin quantization axis . in this case",
    "the energies of the system will be @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of the spin - hamiltonian containing the magnetic exchange and the double exchange contributions ( index @xmath24 runs over the energy levels with given total spin protection @xmath25 ) .",
    "we use them further to define the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath26 for the entangled ground state @xmath27 of the system @xcite :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 .",
    "the ground state is in the subspace @xmath30 for which @xmath31 = 0 for all @xmath24 .",
    "the entanglement entropy between a subspace @xmath30 and the rest of the system @xmath32 is given by :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the reduced density matrix of the subspace @xmath30 obtained by tracing out over all those parts of the hilbert space not associated with @xmath30 .",
    "we consider the subspace @xmath35 consisting of all spin pairs ( not only neighboring ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the ground states @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the system @xmath32 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix , needed to calculate the entanglement , can be written in terms of the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath40 ( see eq . ( 5 ) ) :    @xmath41    where @xmath42    suppose @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the orthonormal basis states of the many - body hilbert space of the subsystems @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "a general quantum spin state of the composite system can be described by  wave function @xcite :    @xmath45    here , a rectangular matrix @xmath46 can be presented always in the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is unitary , @xmath49 is diagonal and the rows of @xmath50 are orthonormal . it is known already as the singular - value decomposition ( svd ) . using this decomposition in eq .",
    "( 8) and forming a new basis by combining the @xmath51 with @xmath48 and the @xmath52 with @xmath53 , one can obtain the schmidt decomposition @xcite :    @xmath54    which represents the total wave function @xmath55 of the system as a single sum of products of the orthonormal functions . here",
    "the @xmath56 number of the terms is limited by the smallest one of the two hilbert spaces and the weight factors @xmath57 are the matrix elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath49 .        if @xmath55 is normalized , their absolute magnitudes squared sum to one .",
    "the entanglement properties of a system are performed with the set of @xmath57 :    @xmath58    where    @xmath59",
    "quantum entanglement is primary criteria of quantum computer efficiency . due to that fact retention of entanglement for a long time",
    "is main challenge facing researchers .",
    "this problem calls decoherence . a great number of increase",
    "the coherence time methods for circumvent this phenomenon are invented .",
