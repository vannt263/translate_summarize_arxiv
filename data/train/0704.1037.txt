    "furthermore , single ions and arrays of ions can be stored in paul and penning traps , and sideband laser cooling allows to prepare ions in the vibrational ground state of these trapping potentials @xcite .",
    "the controlled preparation , manipulation and measurement of electronic internal and motional states of laser driven single atoms and ions , combined with the possibility of controlled entanglement of atoms and ions provides the basic ingredients to for investigations of fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics , and applications such as high - precision measurements and quantum information . in quantum information processing entanglement of qubits stored in internal states of single atoms or ions",

    ", where the atom ( ion ) is prepared in a given motional state of an atom ( ion ) trap , and we move the traps to guide the atom and ion wave packet to `` collide '' for a given time ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : contrcoll ] ) .",
    "our focus is the development of a _ quantum - defect _",
    "formalism for trapped atoms and ions , in a form which is convenient for future applications and extensions , in particular in the context of quantum information processing to swap qubits stored in atoms and ions , and the entanglement of these qubits in a controlled collision .",
    "the atom - ion collision is governed by the potential @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the dipolar polarizability  to be contrasted to a van der waals potential @xmath6 which represents the collisional interactions between e.g. alkali atoms in their electronic ground state .",
    "below we will calculate the dynamics of the interacting atom - ion system for a given time - dependence of the motion of the trap .",
    "this includes the transition to excited trap states after the collision , the possible formation of an excited atom - ion ( molecule ) complex , and the description of trap induced resonances .     , width=325 ]    to study the controlled atom - ion collisions we first derive an effective hamiltonian , describing effective net forces acting on the particles moving in rapidly changing laser and rf fields . in our approach , we include in the hamiltonian only the asymptotic part of the atom - ion potential , whereas the short - range interactions are taken into account by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the wave function at @xmath7 . in the regime of cold collisions considered here , the boundary conditions can be expressed in terms of a single quantum - defect parameter , independent of the collisional _ energy _ and _ angular momentum_. the quantum - defect approach is dictated by the relatively long - range character of the atom - ion interaction , which exceeds the typical size of the trapping potentials , and , in contrast to the neutral atoms , excludes the applicability of the pseudopotential .",
    "our method to describe the dynamics of the controlled collision is based on the application of the correlation diagrams , i.e. energy spectra as a function of the trap separation .",
    "such correlation diagrams , widely used in quantum chemistry to characterize reactions of diatomic molecules , connect in our case the asymptotic vibrational states with the molecular and vibrational states at zero trap separations . at the intermediate distances the energy curves exhibit avoided or diabatic crossings , depending on the symmetry of eigenstates and of the coupling term in the hamiltonian . in the atom - ion system",
    "the avoided crossing can be attributed to the resonances between molecular and vibrational states , that appear when the energy of a vibrational level , coincide with the energy of a molecular state shifted by the external trapping .",
    "the dynamics in the vicinity of such avoided crossings can be accurately described in the framework of the landau - zener theory . in this paper",
    "we determine the level splitting at the avoided crossing , at different trap separations , and for different symmetries of the molecular states . in this way",
    "we can characterize the time scale appropriate for adiabatic or diabatic traversing of a given avoided crossing .",
    "in our paper we consider two different geometries of the trapping potentials : spherically symmetric traps and very elongated cigar - shape traps ( quasi-1d traps ) .",
    "the former case requires full three - dimensional treatment , while the latter one can be described using an effective one - dimensional hamiltonian . in the latter case ,",
    "the tight transverse confinement effectively renormalizes the one - dimensional quantum - defect parameters .",
    "in addition , very elongated cigar - shape traps exhibit another type of resonances , that can be observed at zero - trap separations , but for changing ratio of the transverse confinement to the s - wave scattering length of the atom - ion interaction .",
    "such confinement - induced resonances appear when the energy of the colliding particles coincide with energy of a bound state lifted up by the tight transverse potential .",
    "as already outlined above , the counterpart to the idea of ultracold controlled trap - guided collisions has been implemented in optical lattices , where application of spin - dependent potentials has allowed to entangle atoms between neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "moreover , resonance phenomena in trapped systems , similar to the ones considered here , have been already thoroughly investigated for interactions between neutral atoms . in quasi-1d systems , collisions between neutral atoms",

    "the interaction is more complicated ; however , it turns out that a detailed knowledge of the form of core region of the potential is not necessary , and that it can be subsumed in our model by introducing a set of ( energy independent ) quantum - defect parameters .",

    "_ expansion in the basis of born - oppenheimer wave functions for electron motion_. we start from generating a complete set of electronic wave functions , parametrized by the positions of the atomic core and of the ion @xmath291 in this way the total wave function can be expanded in the basis of born - oppenheimer electronic wave functions @xmath292 since the basis is complete , the expansion of the wave function does not involve any approximations .",
    "_ retaining in the expansion only the modes coupled by the laser_. in the expansion we keep only two modes coupled by the laser light creating the optical lattice : the electronic ground state @xmath293 and the electronic excited state @xmath294 . in this way we utilize the born - oppenheimer approximation , treating the electron motion in the adiabatic approximation",
    "this assumes that the time scale of the electron dynamics is much faster than the dynamics of the atomic nucleus and of the ion , which is typically fulfilled since the electron is much lighter than the other two particles .",
    "the approximation of the two coupled channels can be easily generalized to more , or even infinite number of channels , since the other channels are weakly populated and we treat them within the perturbation theory .",
    "_ adiabatic elimination of the excited electronic state coupled through the laser : derivation of the optical trap potential_. the expansion coefficients @xmath295 and @xmath296 fulfill the following set of coupled equations :    @xmath297    where @xmath298 is the dipole matrix element between the ground and excited electronic states , which in general depends on the position of atom and ion . in the derivation of - we have neglected the action of the rf field on the atom core and the electron , putting @xmath299 we focus on the regime of far - detuned laser : @xmath300 , where @xmath301 denotes the detuning @xmath302 , and @xmath303 is the the rabi frequency . for such conditions , the excited state is only weakly populated and can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "additional simplification comes from the fact that the transitions between states @xmath304 and @xmath100 , due to the laser light , occur on a time scale much shorter than the motion of atom and ion , and the dynamics of the atom and ion centers of masses can be decoupled from the internal dynamics , in full analogy to the born - oppenheimer approximation . eliminating the excited state , in basically the same manner as in the standard derivation of the ac stark shift ,",
    "we obtain the following equation that governs the dynamics of the atom and ion center of masses : @xmath305 where @xmath306 is the effective potential due to the laser field . in the formula",
    "we have neglected the position dependence of the detuning @xmath307 and of the dipole matrix element @xmath308 , assuming that they are modified only at very short distances between the particles .",
    "this can be justified , since in the atomic collisions , the probability of finding the particles at short distances , comparable to the range of chemical binding forces , is typically very small .",
    "_ time averaging over fast oscillations of the rf field : derivation of the paul trapping potential_. we replace the time - dependent rf field by an effective , adiabatic potential . in this way we neglect the fast micromotion of the ion on the time scale of @xmath285 @xcite .",
    "finally we obtain the following equation that describes the dynamics of the wave function @xmath295 dependent on the atom and ion positions @xmath309 here @xmath310 denotes the effective potential @xmath311 where @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 for @xmath280 . the interaction between atom and ion",
    "is given by @xmath315  the ground - state energy of the electron motion , which at large distances behaves as @xmath316 .",
    "in principle , the replacement of the @xmath0 interaction by the pseudopotential is strictly valid when @xmath317 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to try to determine @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath318 using the energy - dependent pseudopotentials . to this end",
    "we replace the @xmath0 interaction with @xcite @xmath319 for even scattering , and @xcite @xmath320 for odd scattering . here",
    ", @xmath321 is the energy - dependent @xmath1-wave scattering length , @xmath322 is the @xmath148-wave scattering length : @xmath323 , the symbol @xmath324 ( @xmath325 ) denotes the gradient operator that acts to the left ( right ) of the pseudopotential , and @xmath326 , @xmath327 are the @xmath1- and @xmath148-wave phase shifts , respectively .    in 1d",
    "the even ( @xmath328 ) and odd ( @xmath329 ) scattering waves have the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath330 , and @xmath331 ( @xmath332 ) , where @xmath333 and @xmath334 denote even and odd scattering phases , respectively .",
    "in analogy to the three - dimensional scattering theory , we define 1d even ( @xmath335 ) and 1d odd ( @xmath336 ) scattering lengths : @xmath337 . from this definition",
    "it follows that for @xmath61 the even and odd scattering waves behaves as : @xmath338 and @xmath339 ( @xmath332 ) .",
