    "at the simplest level biological membranes are modeled by homogeneous flexible bilayers of amphiphilic lipid molecules  @xcite",
    ". however , in many physical and biological situations , these membranes are inhomogeneous on some microscopic scale .",
    "indeed four major distinct lipid types are typically present in mammalian cell membranes @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask what may be the role of this homogeneity in the biological context and how it influences the mechanical properties of the cell .",
    "the interplay between the lipid composition and membrane fluctuations has been addressed in many recent studies .",
    "the local composition of the membrane will clearly affect its fluctuations and local geometry .",
    "indeed , the coupling between membrane fluctuations and local composition is at the origin of the budding instability  @xcite seen in certain systems . on the other hand , membrane fluctuations will also influence its local composition . in this paper",
    "we will examine how the coupling of membrane fluctuations to local composition can affect the phase ordering of its component lipids .    in previous works , the way in which the fluctuation ",
    "composition coupling is incorporated into the overall free energy of system falls into two main classes : i ) the membrane is composed of a homogeneous lipid background with added insertions such as trans - membrane proteins and attached polymers .",
    "ii ) the membrane is modeled as a multicomponent system with several lipid types and where the mechanical properties of the system are dependent on the relative local concentrations of the various lipid types .",
    "the insertions considered in models of class i ) modify the membrane fluctuations via several different mechanisms .",
    "first point - like inclusions , such as polymers , exert a pressure distribution on the flexible membrane .",
    "this involves a coupling of the membrane composition , in this case the density field of the inclusions , to the height @xmath3 over the projected area of the membrane .",
    "another possible coupling is via an imposed boundary condition on the height field @xmath4 at the boundary between the inclusions and the membrane .",
    "for example , the contact angle at the boundary can be taken to be fixed in order to minimize the hydrophobic free energy of the insertion .",
    "this is an example of a hard constraint .",
    "alternatively one can introduce a general coupling tensor , related to the orientational degrees of freedom of the inclusions , to the local strain tensor @xmath5 , from which the curvature tensor can be extracted .",
    "this then corresponds to an energetic term which induces a preferred local curvature . in the literature",
    "several types of inclusions are considered : circular  @xcite , elliptic  @xcite , more general  @xcite embedded inclusions , as well as adsorbed cylinders  @xcite .",
    "besides introducing a tendency for a spontaneous local curvature , which breaks the up - down symmetry of the system , inclusions may also modify the energy associated wit terms quadratic in the curvature tensor . for example isotropic inclusions may modify the local bending and gaussian rigidities of the membrane . in the case of two inclusions",
    "one may then explicitly evaluate their effective interaction .",
    "to summarize , the density field of the inclusions in all these cases is coupled via : ( a ) @xmath4 in the case of insertions exerting a pressure , ( b ) an effective vectorial @xmath6 coupling in the case of imposed boundary conditions at the inclusions frontier with the membrane , ( c ) a two tensor coupling to @xmath7 when there is a locally preferred curvature tensor and finally ( d ) a coupling to @xmath8 , when the local bending and gaussian rigidities are modified by the inclusions and also when non - isotropic effects are present .",
    "the above are the most physically relevant couplings up to quadratic order and consequently are the most significant in systems where the height fluctuations are relatively small .    in this case of models of type ii ) , the variation of the elastic properties of the membrane is more continuous than in the case of inclusions . if one neglects the possibility of non - isotropic effects , the most natural parameters which will vary with local lipid composition are the bending rigidity @xmath2 , the gaussian rigidity @xmath9 and the spontaneous local curvature @xmath10 .",
    "for instance a concentration dependent spontaneous curvature is considered in  @xcite .",
    "linear perturbations to both the bending rigidity and the spontaneous curvature are studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "linear perturbations to the bending and gaussian rigidity were considered , the interaction arising in this case is proportional to @xmath11 and the prefactor is given by the product of coefficients of the linear deviations from the average value of @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "the induced interaction may thus be attractive or repulsive depending on the sign of these coefficients .",
    "of course models of type ( i ) , with discrete inclusions , can be described by models of type ( ii ) when it makes sense to take a continuum limit for the inclusions .",
    "this limit will be valid for inclusion sizes which are comparable to the microscopic length scale of the membrane , that is to say the lateral lipid size .",
    "all of the studies mentioned above assume zero surface tension .",
    "however , the study of membranes under tension sheds light upon the physics of biological membranes which are not truly at equilibrium but under external constraints or perturbations .",
    "the surface tension can be due to electrostatic interactions with the aqueous solvent or due to the presence of molecular protrusions .",
    "furthermore , the external action of laser tweezers on a vesicle attracts phospholipids an puts the membrane under tension .",
    "this leads to interesting phenomena such as pearling instabilities  @xcite .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that the presence of surface tension can induced a _ repulsive _ interaction between inclusions of the same type  @xcite .",
    "the model used in  @xcite is of type i ) and is based on a linear coupling of the inclusion to the height of the membrane , for example to model the local pressure exerted by an attached polymer .",
    "the interaction is sensitive to the strength of membrane - inclusion coupling . in this system ,",
    "the up - down symmetry of the membrane is clearly broken by the linear coupling .",
    "indeed , in many biological situations the up - down symmetry of the membrane is clearly broken for instance by different compositions in the top and bottom leaves or by the presence of conical trans - membrane inclusions . however , it is interesting to ask if the presence of surface tension can also lead to repulsive interaction between domains , with similar lipid composition , even when the up - down symmetry is conserved .",
    "the physics of phase separation may play an important role in biological systems .",
    "it has been experimentally shown that erythrocyte membranes which contain many different lipid types form immiscible two dimensional liquids , which are very close to the miscibility critical point  @xcite .",
    "the resulting thermodynamic forces can affect the mechanical properties of the membrane and in particular its shape .",
    "however , in turn the fluctuations will also affect the distribution of the components in the membrane . as an example , a long - range fluctuation mediated repulsion between inclusions , combined with a short - range van der waals attraction , could lead to the formation of mesoscopic domains  @xcite of the inclusions .",
    "it has also been shown that the presence of a surface tension modifies the effective interactions between conical inclusions @xcite , inclusions of the same type are always repelled but oppositely orientated inclusions interact attractively at long distances and then repel at shorter distances .",
    "this is in contrast to the case where there is no tension when all interactions are always repulsive .    in this paper , we consider a two - component bilayer with the up - down symmetry and , in general , with a non - zero surface tension .",
    "we show that for certain variations of the bending rigidity and the local surface energy ( the composition independent component of which can be interpreted as a surface tension ) with the local composition in lipids , a fluctuation induced lipid - lipid repulsive interaction can appear between domains of similar composition .",
    "this , together with a short - range van der waals attraction , can induce the formation of mesophases . in the scheme of previous models",
    ", our model falls into the class of type ii ) above and our cumulant expansion method is similar to that used in @xcite and @xcite . in our study",
    "we add an non - zero surface energy , as in  @xcite , but where this local surface energy fluctuates with the local lipid composition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our field theoretical model . in section",
    "iii using a cumulant expansion for small height fluctuations we calculate the induced interaction , this rather technical section may be skipped by a reader interested only in the physical consequences of the calculation . in section",
    "iv the general physical properties and asymptotic behavior of this effective interaction are discussed .",
    "section  v is devoted to a description of the results which are compared to previous studies .",
    "in addition we suggest a possible experiment where the effects predicted here could possibly be seen .",
    "we consider a model membrane with two lipid types @xmath12 and @xmath13 and where the top and bottom leaves have the same lipid composition . in the most frequent case ,",
    "at least whenever van der waals interactions are dominant , it is energetically favorable for lipids of the same type to be adjacent . in this case , we can write down a typical attractive energy per site @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the liquid volume fraction of lipid @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath17 is a flory parameter related to electronic polarizabilities of both molecules",
    ". we will consider a coarse - grained model for a field @xmath1 related to the local surface fraction of the two lipid types , i.e. @xmath18 , which in the absence of surface fluctuations exhibits a continuous phase transition at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the theory is then described by the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath19 = \\int \\sqrt{g}d^2{\\bf x}\\ \\left[{j\\over 2 } g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\phi\\nabla_j \\phi + v(\\phi)\\right],\\label{eqm0}\\ ] ] which is written in a covariant form which ensures the independence of the energy from the choice of the two dimensional coordinate system denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is positive and related to the flory parameter @xmath22 , it is a ferromagnetic interaction and energetically favors lipids of the same type being next to each other .",
    "the potential @xmath23 fixes the two characteristic values of @xmath1 and the global composition via chemical potential like terms .",
    "as the potential @xmath24 appears in @xmath25 simply integrated over the area of the membrane , it can be interpreted as a _ composition dependent contribution to the surface energy _ of the membrane .",
    "indeed , the constant part of @xmath24 which is @xmath26 can be interpreted as a surface tension because it is coupled to the total physical area of the membrane @xmath27 .",
    "the term @xmath26 can thus be used as a lagrange multiplier to fix the physical membrane area . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath24 will have a @xmath1 dependence as in the usual landau models for phase separating systems .",
    "as in standard landau theory , we will assume that @xmath24 is a single well at high temperature and a double well at low temperature .",
    "this means that the system on a plane will exhibit a continuous phase transition . at the mean field level",
    ", this transition occurs when when the mass associated to this field theory , given by @xmath28 , vanishes ( where @xmath29 is the homogeneous mean field solution ) .",
    "this transition exhibits a divergent correlation length and corresponds to a macro - phase separation which occurs at a critical temperature @xmath30 .    in the above ,",
    "the metric of the membrane surface is denoted by @xmath31 and in the monge gauge it is given by @xmath32 where @xmath4 is the height of the surface above the projection plane whose area we will denote by @xmath12 .",
    "the term @xmath33 denotes the determinant of @xmath31 and is given by @xmath34 hence the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eqm0 ] ) already implicitly includes a coupling between the local composition , as encoded by @xmath1 , and the membrane fluctuations , as encoded by @xmath4 .",
    "the interface energy or line tension , which corresponds to the term quadratic in the gradient , is written as to ensure covariance ; @xmath35 is the inverse of @xmath31 and is given by @xmath36 here we note that the fact that one should use the covariant form of the line tension is often forgotten in the literature .",

    "this hamiltonian corresponds to a bending energy with local bending rigidity which depends on the local composition characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "the two dimensional membrane system is assumed to have no spontaneous curvature and thus has an up - down symmetry .",
    "more generally , one could also include a composition dependence on the gaussian rigidity , the contribution coming from this term would then cease to be a topological invariant and should strictly be included .",

    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath21 coming from the landau - ginzburg theory , is somehow related to the van der waals attractions between lipids and varies roughly as @xmath158 such that @xmath159 is fixed for given lipid types and independent on temperature .",
    "although we do not know exactly the value of this parameter , we can assume @xmath160 .",
    "for lipidic vesicles made of a mixing of two very different lipids such as dmpc / cholesterol ( a long lipid and a short one ) , the curvature modulus has been experimentally measured @xmath161 ( @xmath162 with dmpc alone ) and increases when the proportion of cholesterol increases up to @xmath163 with 50% of cholesterol  @xcite .",

    "( [ v])([approxlarger ] ) is also proportional to the thermal energy but it is solely due to fluctuations in the surface or elastic energy .    a few works focused on the effect of the surface tension on fluctuation induced interactions  @xcite . calculating the potential between two circular inclusions which locally apply a pressure on the membrane , evans _",
    "et al . _ found an interaction which is everywhere repulsive  @xcite between inclusions of the same type and is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 is related to the force distribution of inclusions @xmath172 acting on the membrane surface and @xmath173 is the surface tension . here again , this interaction is different from eq .",

    "this proximity to a liquid - liquid immiscibility critical point in a real biological context is supported by beautiful experiments on mono - layers made of lipids extracted from erythrocytes  @xcite .",
    "in this study we have seen that the induced interaction only has a repulsive when component when @xmath175 .",
    "qualitatively , this means that the signs of @xmath176 and @xmath177 are opposite : when a region is locally enriched for instance in lipid @xmath12 , bending rigidity increased ( @xmath178 ) whereas the effective surface tension decreases ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "let us consider for a moment the mean - field theory where one neglects the fluctuations @xmath46 about @xmath29 .",
    "consider an incompressible membrane which is constrained to have a constant projected area , for example a membrane supported by a frame .",
    "also let the membrane exchange lipid species with the bulk solution around it @xcite .",
    "the mean - field free energy as a function of @xmath29 is given from eq .",

    "as the membrane is in a solution containing a reservoir of lipid species , @xmath29 is not fixed but is thermodynamically selected so as to minimize the mean - field free energy . in this case ,",
    "in our previous treatment we should have thus included a term @xmath182 in the expression for @xmath183 , however this term can be seen to cancel exactly with the first term of the cumulant expansion , which in this case is also now no longer zero .",

    "now it is straightforward to show , see for example  @xcite , at the the mean field level used here that ratio of the excess area to the projected area is given as @xmath189 in terms of the ratio of the excess to projected area , equation  [ feme2 ] can now be written as @xmath190 +   { \\kappa'(\\phi_0 ) \\over \\kappa(\\phi_0)}\\left [ { \\lambda^2\\over 8\\pi \\beta } -{v(\\phi_0 ) \\delta",

    "hence we find @xmath175 which suggests a scenario to observe the formation of mesophases experimentally .",
    "for instance one can use a membrane composed by a mixture of dpmc / cholesterol and supported by a frame close at a temperature close to @xmath145 .    in a more general context ,",
    "molecular dynamics  @xcite and monte carlo simulations  @xcite have shown that the bending rigidity has a non - monotonic behavior as a function of the short lipid number fraction @xmath195 : it first decreases rapidly for small @xmath195 and then increases slowly , with a minimum around @xmath196 .",
    "these studies suggest that for a two - component bilayer made of short and long lipids , the gradient of @xmath0 and @xmath23 could have opposite signs but some tuning may be required . in this case",
    "the effective interaction will have a repulsive component which could induce mesoscopic phase separation .",
    "the issue of mesophase formation has been discussed in several papers .",
    "taniguchi  @xcite has shown in a model with a linear coupling of the composition @xmath1 to the mean curvature that near to spherical vesicles with off - critical compositions exhibit circular domains that closely resemble patterns observed in red blood cell echinocytosis  @xcite .",
    "a similar study has been carried out in different geometries  @xcite and the same general phenomena are observed .",
    "inspired by the problem of pattern formation of quantum dots at the air - water interface , sear _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the effects of a short - range attraction ( on top of a shorter range hard core ) and long - range repulsion in monte carlo simulations of two dimensional systems of interacting particles . in their simulations both circular domains and stripes were observed as is the case in the experiments .    finally , by adding an attractive short - range interaction to the potential eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , evans _",
    "et al . _ have argued that mesophase formation  @xcite could be induced .",
    "hence , it could explain the formation of caveolae buds from cell membranes and their striped texture .",
    "the mechanism proposed in this paper of course leads to the same phenomenology in the case where the effective potential induced by membrane fluctuations has an intermediate range repulsive component .",
    "however we do not find any repulsion in the situation where @xmath197 which implies some conditions on the membrane composition which could perhaps be tested experimentally .",
    "the model presented in this paper can be generalized by considering lipid distributions without the up - down symmetry , i.e. with different compositions in the up and bottom leaves . in this case",
    ", one would introduce a composition dependent spontaneous curvature , @xmath198 in the hamiltonian .",
    "if one assumes that the mixed homogeneous phase has no spontaneous curvature then one takes @xmath199 and in this case the correction to the long - range interaction is @xmath200 ^ 2 k_0(mr)\\ ] ] and the mass is renormalized ( by a repulsive term ) .",
    "hence this correction is attractive and could wipe out the above repulsive effect .",
    "the two - component membrane could also contain trans - membrane proteins . despite the fact that the repulsive interaction between inclusions described by evans _ et al .",
    "_ would appear , it is well known that protein aggregation also increases the local lipid composition , as observed in erythrocyte membranes where it induces a phospholipid enrichment  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of protein - like insertions in this two - lipid model could thus produce quite rich behavior and is a line worth pursuing .",
    "our study has predicted that it is possible that a membrane whose fluctuations are impeded exhibits a macro - phase separation whereas if it is allowed to fluctuate freely this transition becomes a mesophase separation . in a stack of membranes",
    "the fluctuations are suppressed by helfrich forces @xcite which are of steric origin .",
    "experimentally , therefore , one could prepare a stack of bilayers at a lipid composition where the bilayers within the stack exhibit a macro - phase separation .",
    "however , according to our predictions , a single membrane could possibly exhibit a mesophase separation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that one could try and observe the effect predicted here by using charged membranes and then varying their rigidity by changing the bulk solution s salt content @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , in this paper , we have concentrated on an entirely equilibrium mechanism as a possible explanation for the formation of mesoscopic domains .",
    "however in living cells , out of equilibrium effects are of course important .",
    "recently the recycling of lipids between the membrane and cell interior has been put forward as a non - equilibrium mechanism for the formation of raft - like structures in active systems  @xcite ."
