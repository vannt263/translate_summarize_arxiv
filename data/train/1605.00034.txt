    "at low temperature , atoms and molecules typically self - assemble into crystalline order . the challenge to derive this fundamental phenomenon from a mathematical model of the interatomic interactions",
    "is known as the _ crystallization problem_. in the limit of zero temperature and long time , observed configurations are expected to correspond to minimizers of the interaction energy , and so the crystallization problem amounts to proving that energy minimizers exhibit crystalline order .    our goal in this paper is to understand an important initial result on crystallization in two dimensions in a new way , by introducing and exploiting a _ discrete differential geometry _ viewpoint . we hope that this approach will also aid future progress on the many open crystallization problems , including 3d ones . in a companion paper @xcite , our approach will be used for developing a rigorous understanding of basic defects occuring at non - minimal but low energy for the models studied here .",
    "the important crystallization result we are concerned with is due to heitmann and radin @xcite .",
    "one starts from the prototypical lennard - jones energy for a system of @xmath0 identical atoms with positions @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lennard - jones @xmath11 potential @xmath12 ( see figure [ f : potentials ] ) .",

    ". see @xcite for a list of numerical minimizers in three dimensions for @xmath16 and @xmath0 up to @xmath17 . the model",
    " plays an important role in the physics literature on large systems of atoms above and below the crystallization temperature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for further information about model energies for many - atom systems , including highly accurate quantum - mechanical ones , we refer to the recent survey article @xcite .",
    "as regards mathematical results , even in dimension @xmath18 crystallization of minimizers has not been proved rigorously ( see the end of this introduction for further discussion of this point ) , but heitmann and radin established the beautiful result that when the potential is simplified to @xmath19 then all minimizers are up to rotation and translation subsets of the triangular lattice @xmath20 we note that the heitmann - radin potential is the large-@xmath21 limit of the lennard - jones potential , i.e. @xmath22 ; physically , one is taking a `` brittle limit '' in which the width of the well of the pair potential is compressed to zero and bonds immediately break upon increasing the interparticle distance . for finer information about the minimizers of , such as their asymptotic shape",
    "see @xcite , and for an analogous result in the presence of a three - body potential favouring bond angles of @xmath23 see @xcite .",
    "roughly , our new approach to understanding the heitmann - radin result is as follows .",
    "first , endow the bond graph of a particle configuration with a suitable notion of discrete ( combinatorial ) curvature which vanishes on the expected ground state graphs .",
    "second , `` integrate '' over the whole configuration and use a discrete version of the gauss - bonnet theorem from differential geometry to obtain a purely topological contribution to the total energy .",
    "third , show that this contribution as well as the bulk energy ( of which more below ) can be eliminated , and minimize just the remaining energy contributions .",
    "this strategy can be summarized in the following diagram : @xmath24 finding a suitable notion of curvature which localizes a relevant part of the energy is a long story , told in section [ s : diffgeo ] .",
    "as turns out , we will work with the combinatorial puiseux curvature ( see @xcite or below ) of the triangulated bond graph , i.e. the graph obtained by adding extra edges until all non - triangular faces have been decomposed into triangles . a recent discrete gauss - bonnet theorem by knill",
    "@xcite says that this curvature integrates to a multiple of the euler characteristic of the bond graph ( see also theorem [ t : gb ] below , which extends this result to irregular boundaries as needed here ) .",
    "this leads to the following exact expression for the energy , of an arbitrary configuration @xmath25 ( see theorem [ t : geo ] below ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the euler characteristic of the bond graph and @xmath28 is a natural _ defect measure _ , namely the number of additional edges due to triangulation ( see ) . for nice configurations ,",
    "@xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the original bond graph as @xmath30 the remaining energy contribution @xmath31 in is a _ combinatorial perimeter _ , defined on nice configurations as the number of boundary edges and extended to irregular configurations as suggested by geometric measure theory @xcite , namely by counting `` wire edges '' twice ( see figure [ f : edge ] and ) .",
    "the heitmann - radin proof of crystallization relies on the following remarkable but somewhat mysterious inequality due to harborth @xcite : for configurations with interparticle distance @xmath32 and simply closed polygonal boundary , @xmath33 the proof uses an `` elementary '' lower bound on the inner angle @xmath34 between incoming and outgoing boundary edge at the boundary vertex @xmath35 ( see figure [ f : puiseux ] ) , @xmath36 our simplified form of the harborth inequality is @xmath37 ( see lemma [ l : lower ] ) .",
    "the underlying `` elementary '' bound will be seen to have the following differential - geometric meaning : _ the combinatorial puiseux curvature as introduced by knill @xcite of the boundary of the bond graph is pointwise bounded from below by the euclidean puiseux curvature of the associated polygon in the plane_. see proposition [ p : curvaturebound ] .",
    "the global inequality will be derived from this curvature bound by integration over the boundary and using gauss - bonnet .",
    "another interesting outcome of the differential - geometric viewpoint is a generalization of the decomposition to soft potentials such as . in this case , edges of the bond graph are taken to correspond to particle pairs whose distance lies in a suitable neighbourhood @xmath38 $ ] of the optimal distance @xmath4 , and the energy is shown to satisfy @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the elastic energy of the bonds which vanishes for optimal bondlengths @xmath4 ( see in section [ s : energy ] ) , and @xmath41 the energy due to non - bonded interactions ( see ) .",
    "we emphasize that holds for _ arbitrary _ configurations .",
    "hence it is potentially useful not just for the study of minimizers , but also for studying crystallization at finite temperature or analyzing the molecular dynamics of crystal formation .",
    "what can be said about minimizers in the soft potential case ?",
    "one might expect that when @xmath10 is `` close '' to , minimizing configurations are `` close '' to subsets of a suitable lattice , up to a boundary layer of @xmath42 particles .",
    "the deep insight of theil @xcite ( see @xcite for an extension and @xcite for a computer - aided generalization to a class of three - body potentials in 3d ) that @xmath0-particle lattice subsets achieve the optimal asymptotic energy per particle in the limit @xmath43 is very suggestive of such a behaviour of the positions .",
    "unfortunately , the methods introduced here are insufficient ; in particular , the pointwise bound of discrete puiseux curvature by euclidean puiseux curvature breaks down , and hence so does our differential - geometric proof of .",
    "in this section we are concerned with _ arbitrary _ @xmath0-particle configurations in the plane . we endow them with additional mathematical structure ( graph ; metric ; discrete curvature ) and derive a discrete gauss - bonnet theorem by adapting recent work of knill @xcite to general triangular graphs .      by a _ configuration _ of a system of @xmath0 identical particles in two dimensions we mean a set @xmath44 of mutually distinct particle positions @xmath45 .",
    "discard now any detailed features of the pair potential @xmath10 and just assume that it has a unique minimum , say at @xmath4 .",
    "we say that two particles @xmath35 and @xmath46 in @xmath47 are linked by an _ edge _ , or _ bond _ , if their mutual distance lies in a suitable neighbourhood , or _",
    "bond range _ , @xmath38 $ ] around the optimal distance @xmath4 .",
    "fix such a bond range @xmath38 $ ] , with @xmath48 ; the associated set of edges is @xmath49 we call the graph @xmath50 the _ bond graph _ of the configuration .",
    "see figure [ f : bond ] .",
    "simple geometric considerations show that the bond graph is a _ planar graph _",
    "( i.e. , for any two different edges @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the corresponding line segments @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 $ ] do not cross ) provided @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the minimum interparticle distance @xmath57 .",
    "condition can be fulfilled by a suitable choice of the maximum bondlength @xmath58 if and only if the particle configuration satisfies the mild minimal distance condition @xmath59 we remark that if a particle pair achieved equality in , its standard lennard - jones ( 6,12 ) energy would be + 48 , a value almost two orders of magnitude above the binding energy @xmath60 . hence violations of should never occur for planar ground state configurations of physical systems ; for a rigorous proof in case of the lennard - jones ( 6,12 ) energy see @xcite . in the sequel we assume that  are satisfied .      in order to study crystallization , it will be very useful to distinguish between `` interior '' and `` boundary '' particles and edges .",
    "to this end we first introduce _ faces .",
    "_ by a face @xmath61 we mean any open and bounded subset of @xmath62 which is nonempty , does not contain any point @xmath63 , and whose boundary is given by a cycle , i.e. , @xmath64 $ ] for some points @xmath65 with @xmath66 . do not need to be pairwise distinct , as a face might contain `` inner wire edges '' ( see figure [ f : edge ] ) .",
    "note also that for non - connected graphs , our definition differs slightly from standard conventions because ring - shaped regions bounded by two cycles are not faces .",
    "this has the advantage that the euler characteristic stays unchanged under triangulation . ]",
    "+ edges can now be classified into four types ( see figure [ f : edge ] ) .",
    "we say that an edge is    * a _ regular interior edge _ if it lies on the boundary of two faces , * a _ regular boundary edge _ if it lies on the boundary of precisely one face and that of the complement of the union of all faces , * an _ outer wire edge _ if it does not lie on the boundary of any face , * an _ inner wire edge _ if it lies on the boundary of precisely one face but not on that of the complement of the union of all faces .",
    "the regular interior and inner wire edges are called _ interior edges _ , and the regular boundary and outer wire edges are called _",
    "boundary edges_. finally we are in a position to distinguish mathematically between interior and boundary _ particles _ ( see figure [ f : bond ] ) .",
    "we say that a particle is    * an _ interior particle _ if it is incident only with interior edges , and * a _ boundary particle _ if it is isolated or incident with a boundary edge .",
    "the set of boundary particles will in the sequel be denoted by @xmath67 , and the set of interior particles by @xmath68 .      as explained in the introduction , an important role in our analysis",
    "is played by the _",
    "combinatorial perimeter _ of the bond graph . for general configurations",
    "we define it as follows : @xmath69 we note that @xmath70 is additive over connected components , and coincides for connected graphs with edge length 1 with the geometric perimeter of the set @xmath71 in the plane obtained by taking the union of vertices , edges , and faces of the bond graph @xmath50 .",
    "note that the geometric perimeter , defined as the infimum of the length of simply closed smoooth curves whose interior contains @xmath71 , naturally counts wire edges twice .      as mentioned in the introduction , it is not obvious which notion of curvature will be the most fruitful for our purposes . here",
    "are some desiderata .    1 .   _ curvature should be well - defined for general ( irregular ) configurations .",
    "_ 2 .   _ for lattices , zero curvature should single out the energy - minimizing lattices .",
    "_ non - topological defects such as elastic deformation , vacancies , or flat boundaries should not contribute to total curvature .",
    "_    condition ( 1 ) will lead to considering , along with the bond graph , its triangulation , of which more later .",
    "condition ( 3 ) suggests to work with a purely combinatorial notion .",
    "condition ( 2 ) rules out `` universal '' notions such as _ gromov curvature _",
    "@xcite @xmath72 where here and below @xmath73 denotes the unit sphere with respect to the graph metric around a point @xmath35 , that is to say all @xmath74 linked to @xmath35 by an edge .",
    "this is because gromov curvature vanishes on _ all _ of the standard lattices such as the triangular , square , and hexagonal lattice .",
    "euler curvature @xmath75 distinguishes between these lattices , and hence satisfies condition ( 2 ) , but it violates condition ( 3 ) , because it yields a positive contribution from each boundary atom .",
    "what turns out to work is a discrete version of _ puiseux curvature _ , applied not to the bond graph but the _ triangulated bond graph_. discrete puiseux curvature was recently introduced and studied in the context of subdomains of the triangular lattice by knill @xcite , and can be thought of as a boundary - corrected version of euler curvature , corrected in such a way that flat boundaries have curvature zero .",
    "first we define the triangulated bond graph . for any face of the bond graph",
    "@xmath50 with more than 3 edges , say @xmath76 edges ( where inner wire edges are counted twice ) , we add @xmath77 edges connecting not already connected vertices and not crossing each other .",
    "this yields a new graph @xmath78 all of whose faces are triangles and which we call the _ triangulated bond graph_. see figure [ f : triang ] .    .",
    "additional edges due to triangulation of faces with more than 3 edges are shown in red .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    we now define the _ combinatorial puiseux curvature _ of a particle configuration @xmath47 at a point @xmath63 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "denote by @xmath79 the unit sphere around a point in the triangular lattice .",
    "let @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the unit sphere with respect to the graph metric in the triangulated bond graph @xmath78 and @xmath82 denotes the number of its edges .",
    "see figure [ f : puiseux ] .        to explain the meaning of some remarks are in order .",
    "first , @xmath83 is the lattice expected to minimize the energy  , and hence @xmath84 has the desired properties ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . if interactions other than  were under consideration , e.g. angular terms promoting the formation of graphene sheets and nanotubes as recently studied mathematically in @xcite , other reference lattices need to be used in .",
    "second , for interior particles @xmath85 agrees ( up to an overall normalization factor which is a matter of convention ) with the euler curvature , because in a planar triangular graph both the edge degree and the face degree of an interior point @xmath35 agree with the number of edges in the unit sphere around @xmath35 .",
    "third , for boundary particles , definition is a graph - theoretic analogon of the classical euclidean puiseux curvature of the boundary @xmath86 of a polygon @xmath87 in @xmath62 , @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the euclidean unit sphere of radius @xmath90 around @xmath35 and @xmath91 denotes its euclidean length .",
    "see figure [ f : puiseux ] .",
    "the constant term in for boundary particles is the euclidean length of a half - sphere in flat 2d euclidean space , just as the constant term in the second line of is the length ( w.r . to the graph metric ) of the half - sphere in the triangular lattice .",
    "the second term in just gives the interior angle .",
    "a deeper connection between combinatorial and euclidean puiseux curvature will be given in proposition [ p : curvaturebound ] .",
    "the curvature @xmath85 depends on the chosen triangulation , but  as we shall now see ",
    "its sum over all @xmath63 does not ; it is a topological invariant .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath85 for crystallization problems stems from this property , as well as from the fact that it is naturally related to the energy ( see below ) .",
    "recall that the euler characteristic of a planar graph with @xmath92 vertices , @xmath93 edges and @xmath94 faces is defined as @xmath95    [ t : gb ] ( discrete gauss - bonnet ) let @xmath78 be any planar triangular graph .",
    "then @xmath96 in particular , when @xmath78 has simply closed polygonal boundary , @xmath97    this result , and its proof , is a modest extension of recent work of knill who establishes the discrete gauss - bonnet formula for subdomains of the triangular lattice ( see @xcite section 7 , and see @xcite for generalizations to higher dimension ) .",
    "the extra term appearing in for irregular graphs , which we have not seen previously in the literature , may be viewed as a topological characteristic of `` boundary defects '' such as the wire edges depicted in figure [ f : edge ] .",
    "+ * proof * we use the second of the following three `` handshake '' properties ( terminology in @xcite ) for any planar triangular graph @xmath78 . letting @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "we claim that    1 .",
    "@xmath100 2 .",
    "@xmath101 , 3 .",
    "@xmath102 .",
    "the first property is trivial .",
    "the second one follows because each interior edge appears as an edge in two unit spheres , each regular boundary edge appears in one unit sphere , and each wire edge does not appear in any unit sphere . and the third property follows from the fact that each face is triangular , and hence appears in precisely three unit spheres .",
    "the following euler - like curvature will emerge naturally during the computation below .",
    "it is reminiscent of but uses the quantities instead of the edge and face degree ( and we have changed normalization to obtain an integer quantity ) : @xmath103 we compute @xmath104 this establishes the theorem .",
    "note how the surface term in the last but one line is cancelled , at least in the case of graphs with simply closed polygonal boundary , by the passage from euler - like curvature to puiseux curvature .",
    "we now partition the at first sight featureless energy into various geometric and topological contributions . the pair potential may be any function @xmath105 which attains its minimum at @xmath4 and has minimum value @xmath3 .",
    "we begin with a trivial but useful decomposition into minus the number of bonds of the original bond graph @xmath50 , elastic energy , and the energy due to non - bonded interactions . letting @xmath106 }",

    "the first term in , i.e. the number of edges in the untriangulated bond graph , can be decomposed further .",
    "first we introduce the following _ defect measure _ which quantifies the distance of the bond graph @xmath50 from a triangular graph : @xmath109 so that @xmath110 the first term on the right hand side of has sufficient regularity to be amenable to differential - geometric analysis .",
    "recall the definitions and the associated `` handshake '' properties from subsection [ s : dgb ] .",
    "we calculate @xmath111 combining , , , and the discrete gauss - bonnet theorem gives the following final energy decomposition which we state as a theorem .",
    "note that the explicit contribution from boundary _ particles _ in and that from the curvature sum exactly cancel , even for irregular configurations , so that the surface energy contribution reduces to the perimeter .",
    "[ t : geo ] ( geometric energy decomposition ) let @xmath105 be any pair potential which attains its minimum at @xmath4 and has minimum value @xmath3 . for any number @xmath0 of particles , any n - particle configuration @xmath47 satisfying the mild minimum distance bound , and any choice of the bond range @xmath38 $ ] satisfying , the atomistic energy satisfies the following exact decomposition : @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the perimeter , @xmath27 the euler characteristic , @xmath28 the defect measure introduced in , @xmath40 the elastic energy , and @xmath41 the energy due to non - bonded interactions .",
    "the different terms in this decomposition are indicative of the different mechanisms of energy lowering which lead to crystallized ground states of special shape : lowering the euler characteristic @xmath27 aggregates different connected components into a single one ; lowering the perimeter @xmath113 condenses long chains into bulk regions ; lowering the defect measure @xmath29 means forming more and more triangular faces ; lowering the elastic energy means rigidifying stretched or compressed bonds into unit - length ones .",
    "we now comment on some of the individual terms .",
    "the two terms @xmath28 and @xmath27 were introduced with the help of triangulation , but they are in fact independent of the triangulation . regarding @xmath114 this was explained in section [ s : iandb ] , and regarding @xmath29 this follows from the following expression in terms of the faces @xmath61 of the original bond graph @xmath50 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the `` inner perimeter '' of the face @xmath61 which , analogously to the outer perimeter , counts wire edges twice , @xmath117 in particular , for connected @xmath47 , @xmath28 is the sum of the inner perimeter of the non - triangular faces minus 3 times the first betti number @xmath118 of the closed subset in the plane formed by the union of the vertices , edges , and triangular faces .",
    "finally we emphasize the following point . for typical configurations below the crystallization temperature ,",
    "the first two terms , combinatorial bulk energy and combinatorial surface energy , have a clear asymptotic scaling with respect to the particle number @xmath0 , namely @xmath119 and @xmath120 , but the defect measure @xmath29 and the elastic energy @xmath40 do _",
    "not_. hence the above decomposition can not be discovered via asymptotic analysis .",
    "instead , it can be used to study different regimes , such as a single dislocation ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , a dilute dislocation density as relevant for plasticity @xcite ( @xmath123 ) , or lattice elasticity ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) .",
    "an important idea of heitmann and radin @xcite in their proof of crystallization for the potential ( see also @xcite ) was to analyze the energy change when adding or removing not a single atom , but a _ complete layer _ , or `` closed shell '' , of boundary atoms .",
    "this energy change can be derived in a transparent way using discrete curvature and gauss - bonnet , as we show in this section .",
