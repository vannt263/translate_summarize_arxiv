    "the observation of the decay @xmath0 five years ago @xcite opened a new era for particle physics , since the penguin structure of the electroweak theory was probed for the first time .",
    "soon after this observation , the inclusive @xmath4 decay @xcite was also established .",
    "the updated branching ratios for both decays are @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite , respectively . in recent literatures , the inclusive decay @xmath4 receives more attentions than the exclusive mode @xmath0 .",
    "the branching ratio and the photon energy spectrum of the @xmath4 decay have been used to constrain the parameter - space of the new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the preference of studying the inclusive mode is clear in that its hadronic dynamics is much easier to handle as compared to the exclusive mode .",
    "it has been shown that , to the leading order in @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the @xmath9 quark mass , the branching ratio @xmath10 is given by the branching ratio @xmath11 of the corresponding quark - level process .",
    "furthermore , the sub - leading @xmath7-corrections can be parametrized systematically using the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "the hadronic dynamics of the exclusive decay @xmath0 is much more complicated .",
    "specifically , one has to deal with the soft dynamics involved in the @xmath3 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "since the final states are light compared to the decaying @xmath3 meson , one anticipates that perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is applicable to this process because of the large energy release .",
    "in fact , the pqcd formalism based upon factorization theorems , which incorporates the sudakov resummation of soft - gluon effects , has been developed for sometime @xcite , and applied to semileptonic @xcite , inclusive - radiative @xcite and nonleptonic @xmath3 meson decays @xcite .",
    "this approach is so far rather successful . in this article",
    ", we shall extend this formalism to penguin - induced exclusive processes , such as the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the satisfactory result with repect to this complicated process , as presented later , provides further confidence on the validity of the pqcd approach to @xmath3 meson decays .",
    "according to the pqcd factorization theorem , the branching ratio of a heavy meson decay is expressed as the convolution of a hard subamplitude with meson wave functions .",
    "the former , with at least one hard gluon attaching to the spectator quark , is calculable in the usual perturbation theory , while the latter must be extracted from the experimental data or derived by nonperturbative methods , such as qcd sum rules . since the @xmath12 meson wave function has been known from the sum rule analyses @xcite , the @xmath0 decay is an ideal process from which the unknown @xmath3 meson wave function can be determined . with the @xmath3 meson wave function",
    "obtained here , we are able to make predictions for other @xmath3 meson decay modes , especially for the charmless decays .",
    "we shall show that by fitting our prediction for the branching ratio @xmath13 to the cleo data , a @xmath3 meson wave function with a sharp peak at the low momentum fraction is obtained .    comparing our work to others ,",
    "we remark that most of the previous studies on this decay focus only on the contribution of the magnetic - penguin operator @xmath2 , and their approaches are based upon quark models . to ensure that other contributions are indeed negligible , we also calculate the contribution by the current - current operator @xmath14 , which arises through the four - point @xmath15 coupling with the off - shell gluon reabsorbed by a spectator quark .",
    "although such a contribution has been calculated before@xcite , it is however obtained in a naive pqcd framework which does not include the sudakov resummation and the renormalization - group ( rg ) analysis @xcite . as a result , the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite are sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath16 . in our more completed approach , the sensitivity to @xmath16 can be avoided .",
    "we find that , due to certain cancellations , the contribution by @xmath14 turns out to be rather small .",
    "we also like to comment on a different viewpoint based on the overlap integral of meson wave functions @xcite , which showed that the diagrams without any hard gluon dominate over those we will be considering here .",
    "we shall argue that the observation in @xcite is due to an underestimation on the value of the strong coupling constant and a choice of a flat @xmath3 meson wave function .",
    "if evaluating the coupling constant at the characteristic momentum flow involved in the decay process @xcite , and employing a sharper @xmath3 meson wave function , these higher - order contributions may become comparable to the leading - order ones .",
    "hence , the approach in @xcite does not seem to be self - consistent . in our approach ,",
    "the diagrams without hard gluons do not contribute under our parametrization of parton momenta .",
    "therefore , the diagrams with a hard gluon attaching to a spectator are leading in our analysis .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii , we write down the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath17 decay . in particular , the current - current operator @xmath14 and the magnetic - penguin operators @xmath2 are identified as major sources of the contribution .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath14-induced @xmath15 vertex , keeping the gluon line off - shell . in sect .",
    "iii , we derive the factorization formulas for the @xmath0 decay , which include contributions from the various operators .",
    "the numerical result is presented in sect .",
    "iv , where the contribution of each operator is compared . sect .",
    "v is the conclusion .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the flavor - changing @xmath18 transition is now standard , which is given by @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 being the color indices . in the pqcd picture ,",
    "the lowest - order diagrams for the @xmath17 decay arising from operators @xmath14 , @xmath2 and @xmath22 are depicted in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "it is not hard to see that contributions other than the above are negligible .",
    "for example , contributions depicted in fig .  4",
    "are very suppressed , although they are of the same order , @xmath23 @xcite , as those of figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "we draw this conclusion from a previous experience with @xmath24 . indeed , from a diagram similar to fig .  4 ( with @xmath25 replaced by @xmath26 , and the @xmath27 on both sides replaced by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) ,",
    "one has obtained @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is comparable to @xmath33 , it is clear that the diagram in fig .",
    "4 gives @xmath34 , and is thus negligible .",
    "there is still one more type of contributions of the same order as shown in fig .",
    "5 . by an explicit calculation",
    ", one can show that such contributions merely give corrections to the wilson coefficients @xmath35-@xmath36 occuring in fig .",
    "4 . since the matrix elements of fig .  4 and fig .  5",
    "have identical tensor structures , the branching ratio contributed by the latter figure behaves like @xmath37 , which is also negligible . finally , in sect .",
    "iv , we shall see that the contribution by @xmath22 is negligible as well .    before implementing the pqcd formalism to evaluate the contributions of figs .  1 - 3 , we compute the four - point @xmath15 vertex .",
    "our calculation essentially generalizes the work by liu and yao @xcite to the off - shell gluon case@xcite .",
    "we first perform a fierz transformation on @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath38 the @xmath39 vertex is expressed as @xmath40 with the structure - tensor @xmath41 clearly , the form factor @xmath42 can be discarded because of @xmath43 . from the requirement of gauge invariance , _",

    ", we note that both @xmath57 and @xmath58 have smooth limits as @xmath59 .",
    "hence , we can safely neglect the contributions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 to the @xmath15 vertex , since their wilson coefficients , @xmath62 and @xmath36 , are much smaller than @xmath63 .    having determined the @xmath15 vertex , we attach the off - shell gluon line to the spectator quark to form the @xmath0 amplitude as shown in fig",
    ".  1 . as mentioned ,",
    "this amplitude is of the order @xmath64 , the same as the amplitudes induced by @xmath2 and @xmath22 depicted in figs .  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in the next section , we shall compute the contribution of each operator to the @xmath0 decay using the pqcd factorization theorem .",
    "in this section we first review the pqcd factorization theorem developed for nonleptonic heavy meson decays @xcite , and then extend it to the @xmath0 decay .",
    "nonleptonic heavy meson decays involve three scales : the @xmath1 boson mass @xmath65 , at which the matching conditions of the effective hamiltonian to the original hamiltonian are defined , the typical scale @xmath66 of a hard subamplitude , which reflects the dynamics of heavy meson decays , and the factorization scale @xmath67 , with @xmath9 the conjugate variable of parton transverse momenta .",
    "the dynamics below @xmath67 is regarded as being completely nonperturbative , and parametrized into a meson wave fucntion @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the momentum fraction . above the scale @xmath67 , pqcd is reliable and radiative corrections produce two types of large logarithms : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the former are summed by rg equations to give the evolution from @xmath65 down to @xmath66 described by the wilson coefficients @xmath72 . while the latter are summed to give the evolution from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "there exist also double logarithms @xmath73 from the overlap of collinear and soft divergences , @xmath74 being the dominant light - cone component of a meson momentum .",
    "the resummation of these double logarithms leads to a sudakov form factor @xmath75 $ ] , which suppresses the long - distance contributions in the large @xmath9 region , and vanishes as @xmath76 , @xmath77 being the qcd scale .",
    "this factor improves the applicability of pqcd around the energy scale of few gev .",
    "the @xmath9 quark mass scale is located in the range of applicability .",
    "this is the motivation we develop the pqcd formalism for heavy hadron decays .",
    "for the detailed derivation of the relevant sudakov form factors , please refer to @xcite .",
    "with all the large logarithms organized , the remaining finite contributions are absorbed into a hard @xmath9 quark decay subamplitude @xmath78 .",
    "because of sudakov suppression , the perturbative expansion of @xmath79 in the coupling constant @xmath80 makes sense .",
    "therefore , a three - scale factorization formula is given by the typical expression , @xmath81 , \\label{for}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the exponential containing the quark anomalous dimension @xmath82 describes the evolution from @xmath66 to @xmath67 mentioned above .",
    "the explicit expression of the exponent @xmath25 is can be found in @xcite . since",
    "logarithmic corrections have been summed by rg equations , the above factorization formula does not depend on the renormalization scale @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "our formalism then avoids the sensitivity to @xmath16 that appears in @xcite .",
    "we now apply the three - scale factorization theorem to the radiative decay @xmath0 , whose effective hamiltonian has been given in the previous section . as stated before , only the operators @xmath14 , @xmath2 and @xmath22 are crucial , to which the corresponding diagrams and hard subamplitudes are shown in figs .  1 - 3 and table i , respectively .",
