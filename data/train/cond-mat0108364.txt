    "as shown in the table , the magnetizations of m@xmath23 for ascending field are comparable to @xmath24 directly converted from squid data within uncertainty however there is a big difference at the cycled field .",
    "it suggests that @xmath24 of the cycled field is contributed by not only m@xmath23 but also vortices running perpendicular to the surface .",
    "that mechanism in which vortices enter the superconducting film parallel to the surface for ascending field and rotated out of plane during reducing the field has been observed in a nb superconducting film  @xcite .",
    "although we could obtain reasonable results with the model , 1 row or 2 rows , of the vortex distributions , a gaussian distribution could be an alternative choice for the vortices in a superconducting film . figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "shows the best fits with a gaussian distribution of vortices and table  [ table5 ] summarizes the results of the fits .",

    "the density and m@xmath23 are very comparable to the model of 1 row or 2 rows . because of a limit of the spnr sensitivity to this system , it is not able to distinguish between a gaussian distribution and 1 row or 2 rows .",
    "however it is clear that the vortices have a same distribution at ascending fields and they are differently distributed at the cycled field .",
    "for more theoretical understanding of vortex distribution in a superconducting film , we have developed a model calculation for minimizing gibbs free energy .",

    "it means that the vortices more likely stay in 2 rows than 1 row for h @xmath18 2200 oe . this calculation agrees well with the first peak in the magnetization measurement , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] top and strongly suggests that the peak is due to a vortex line transition from 1 row to 2 rows .",
    "the inset at upper right corner shows magnetization which corresponds to the minimum free energy .",
    "there is the second transition ( 2 @xmath50 3 ) at @xmath84000 oe that is also consistent with the second peak in the _ m - h _ curve .",
    "the calculation shows that vortex density of 40 @xmath20 at 1500 oe and 53 @xmath20 at 2000 oe will satisfy the condition of minimizing the free energy with 1 row of vortices in this system . from spnr measurements",

    "the smaller vortex densities at ascending fields can be understood in terms of the surface barriers because the minimizing free energy calculation does not count the barriers .",
    "since the vortex densities at ascending fields are smaller than the maximum vortex density for 1 row , the vortices could stay in a central line however at the cycled field , the vortex density found by spnr is slightly higher than the the maximum vortex density for 1 row .",
    "thus they can not stay in a single row .",
    "it means that the vortex line transition fields can be shifted to a lower field for descending field , as the contribution of the surface barrier is important .",
    "it has been experimentally observed by j. sutton _",
    "as the field is tilted with a small angle , the delay of vortex entrance due to the surface barrier vanishes because the perpendicular component of applied field helps the vortex ingress at a small field .",

    "however we find another peak at @xmath8950 oe of the tilted field .",
    "it is the first observation that the first peak is missing at no - tilted field .",
    "one could easily overlook that the first peak does not come from the vortex line transition .",
    "since it is a thin film , vortices can not enter the superconductor until the applied field is stronger than the surface barrier field . at a tilted field , however , vortices can overcome the surface barrier under support by the perpendicular component of the field even with a small field",
    ". therefore the vortex line transitions could be missing at no - tilted field .",
    "this scenario could work only for that the surface barrier field is larger than the vortex line transition fields .",
    "that is not this case because the measured surface barrier field for the specimen is about 1200 oe and spnr measurement shows 1 row of vortices at ascending fields of 1500 and 2000 oe .",
    "also the calculation for minimizing the free energy suggests that the first vortex line transition may occur at @xmath82200 oe .",
    "thus , we suspect that the first peak at the tilted field comes a vortex line transition .    using eq .",

    "that is very comparable to the first peak at the tilted field .",
    "it might suggest that the peak is due to the lower critical field which is paralle to the surface ( h@xmath3 ) . at a tilted field",
    "( @xmath52 1@xmath2 for this system ) , the first vortex entrance is determined by h@xmath53 instead of h@xmath3 because for a thin film superconductor , h@xmath53 is much smaller than h@xmath3 @xcite . for h@xmath54 ( h@xmath55 ) @xmath18 h@xmath53",
    ", vortices could enter the superconductor and might stay along the applied field due to the dragging force from the applied field .",
    "however the free energy still does not allow the vortices running parallel to the surfaces . when the applied field ( h@xmath56 ) is increased with passing beyond h@xmath3 ,",
    "vortices sightly rotate to parallel to the surfaces , connect the pieces , and make long threads . in this scenario ,",
    "however , the magnetization might be just a little changed because the field is applied with a small tilt angle .",
    "however we find that a large demagnetization effect enhances the change by more than two orders of magnitude because of the thin film geometry .",
    "the demagnetization of the multilayers is discussed in detail below .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the magnetization from the multilayers at 4.5 k. the magnetization from nb(100)/al(20 ) also shows that the first peak is missing at no - tilted field whereas it is observed at 600 oe of a tilted field .",
    "that agrees well with h@xmath3 = 600 oe calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ( z = 0 ) , and @xmath14 = 1800   and @xmath47 = 113  .",

    "that is another evidence that the first peak at a tilted field comes from the vortex rotation instead of the vortex line transition . at 4.5 k ,",
    "two peaks are observed at 845 and 2125 oe from nb(72)/al(20 ) .",
    "the first peak near 845 oe appears without depending on the tilt angle .",
    "it implies that the superconductor is soft and the surface barrier is negligible at the temperature .",
    "since the peak positions are not very sensitive to the temperature that is consistent with previous measurements @xcite , we might also conclude that the first peak comes from the vortex rotation at h@xmath3 .",

    "table  [ table5 ] shows that the vortex line transitions ( 2nd and 3rd peaks ) occur at smaller fields for a thicker film superconductor because vortices have relatively more space to the surfaces in a thicker film and rearrange for spatial commensuration at a smaller field @xcite .",
    "demagnetization factors of the multilayers are quantitatively determined in the meissner regime . in the regime ,",
    "slopes of the magnetization were measured as a function of tilt angle , as shown in fig .",

    "vortex pinning is an important subject for practical application of current transportation . with only thin film geometry where vortices place parallel to the surfaces",

    "we performed spnr measurements on a nb / al multilayer to directly determine the density and distribution of vortices .",
    "spnr shows that the vortices in a nb / al multilayer are localized near the central line below the first peak in the _ m - h _ curve at the ascending field meanwhile vortices have more broadening of the distribution at the descending field .",

    "<S> we present the studies of non - uniformly distributed vortices in nb / al multilayers at applied field near parallel to film surface by using spin - polarized neutron reflectivity ( spnr ) and dc magnetization measurements . </S>",

    "<S> to directly determine the distribution of vortices , we performed spnr measurements on the multilayer and found that the distribution and density of vortices are different at ascending and descending fields . at ascending 2000 </S>",
    "<S> oe which is just below the first peak in the _ m - h _ curve , spnr shows that vortices are mostly localized near a middle line of the film meanwhile the vortices are distributed in broader region at the descending 2000 oe . that is related to the observation of more vortices trapped at the descending field . </S>",
    "<S> as the applied field is sightly tilted ( @xmath1 3.5@xmath2 ) , we observe another peak at a smaller field . </S>",
    "<S> the peak position is consistent with the parallel lower critical field ( h@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss that the vortices run along the applied field below h@xmath3 and rotate parallel to the surface at h@xmath3 .    </S>",
