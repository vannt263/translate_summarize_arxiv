    "<S> we discuss the possibility of changing the energy dependence of the mean multiplicity , i.e. slow down of its growth at the lhc energies due to a gradual transition to the reflecting scattering mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that the elastic scattering amplitude can exceed the limitation assumed by the black disk model at very high energies was discussed a long time ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an energy dependence of the amplitude is a manifestation of a gradual transition to the reflective scattering mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this mode follows , in its turn , from the fact that opening of the new inelastic channels with an energy increase , would not lead to saturation of the total probability of the inelastic collisions at small transverse distance , but instead , it would result in the self - damping of the inelastic channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the natural question is how the lhc data can be interpreted in that sense , namely , are there direct or indirect indications on the presence of this reflective scattering mode at the lhc energies . to answer this question </S>",
    "<S> the experimental signatures of the reflective scattering mode should be considered first .    </S>",
    "<S> the straightforward reconstruction of the impact - parameter dependent elastic amplitude is preferable for that purpose . </S>",
    "<S> it will allow one to conclude on possible crossing of the black disk model limit for the elastic scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> it requires careful analysis of the available experimental data based on the fourier - bessel transformation and an extra assumption on the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> another way is to analyse the experimental data on elastic scattering at large transferred momenta ( deep - elastic scattering ) to deduce the possible consequences for the asymptotics of the elastic amplitude . since the deep - elastic scattering probes the region of small impact parameters , it was proposed @xcite to use these data for discrimination of the asymptotic modes in the hadron scattering . in this region the reflective and absorptive scattering modes have the most significant differences at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> these two modes are associated with the different impact parameter profiles of the inelastic overlap function . as a result , in the reflective scattering mode associated with the unitarity saturation </S>",
    "<S> , the elastic scattering amplitude will asymptotically decouple from the particle production @xcite .    at finite energies </S>",
    "<S> it should be observed that the deep  </S>",
    "<S> elastic scattering has decreasing correlations with particle production as the collision energy increases . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the saturation of the black disk limit implies strong correlation of deep  elastic scattering with the particle production processes . </S>",
    "<S> respective asymptotic differential cross  </S>",
    "<S> section @xmath0 is expected to be four times lower than it is in the case of the reflective scattering mechanism domination .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we consider the implications of the above mentioned decoupling for the global observable related to the many  particle production dynamics , namely , the mean multiplicity of the secondary particles @xmath1 which is a most general and transparent quantity related to the particle production processes .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the inelastic overlap function @xmath2 which enters the unitarity equation for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in the impact parameter representation this equation takes simple form @xmath4 the function @xmath5 is the @xmath6 elastic scattering matrix element . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the scattering amplitude @xmath3 to be a pure imaginary function , i.e. @xmath7 . the function @xmath8 is a real one in this case , but it can change sign and take negative values </S>",
    "<S> . the maximum value of @xmath9 can be reached at high energies at the positive non - zero values of the impact parameter , i.e. , for instance , at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the derivatives of @xmath11 have the form : @xmath12 it is evident that @xmath13 at @xmath10 , if @xmath14 at this value of the impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the derivative of the inelastic overlap function has the sign opposite to the sign of @xmath15 in the region where @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the region of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 variables where the function @xmath8 is negative ( the phase of @xmath8 is such that @xmath19 ) is responsible for the transformation of the central impact  </S>",
    "<S> parameter profile of the function @xmath3 into a peripheral profile of the inelastic overlap function @xmath11 ( fig.1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily seen by expressing the function @xmath11 as a product , i.e @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath21 at high energy and small impact parameters , then the function @xmath11 will have maximum value 1/4 at the non - zero impact parameter value . </S>",
    "<S> the impact parameter dependence of the function @xmath11 would evolve then with energy from a central to a peripheral one . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath1 is obtained by the integration of the corresponding impact - parameter dependent function with the weight function @xmath11 , e.g. the mean multiplicity @xmath1 is written in the form @xmath22 the mean multiplicity @xmath23 in the geometric approach has a central dependence on @xmath18 ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is often considered as a folding integral @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the two - dimensional impact - parameter dependent matter distributions in the colliding hadrons . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> when the weight function @xmath11 evolves with energy to a peripheral profile , the energy dependence of @xmath1 should start to slow down . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it can be expected that power - like energy dependence would gradually slow down , namely @xmath26 starting in the energy region where the function @xmath8 takes negative values . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are determined by the parameters of the model , e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> proceeding from the available experimental information , one can roughly estimate the starting energy of slow down of @xmath1 in the range of @xmath30 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is based on the fact that the value of @xmath31 increases from @xmath32 ( cern isr ) to @xmath33 ( tevatron ) and has a value which is very close to the black disk limitation @xmath34 at @xmath35 tev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if it is so , it would testify in favor of a gradual transition to the reflective elastic scattering starting already at the lhc energies .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the data for the mean multiplicity at the lhc are available for the central region of the rapidity only @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> straightforward extrapolation of this energy dependence to the whole region of rapidity at any fixed energy @xcite looks oversimplified . </S>",
    "<S> the data in the regions not covered by the measurements could demonstrate different energy dependences . </S>",
    "<S> however , assuming the above extrapolation valid , one should expect the slowing mean multiplicity growth be shifted to the region of @xmath36 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is valid also in the particular model based on assumption of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ns ] ) for the mean multiplicity distribution @xmath23 . for the function </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 the following relation is valid @xmath37 where the function @xmath38 can be calculated in a similar way to the calculation of the gap survival probability in the double - pomeron exchange processes performed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath38 has a maximum at @xmath36 tev and decreases beyond those energies like a negative power of energy .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can state that the gradual transition to the reflective scattering mode ( with a prominent peripheral form of the overlap function @xmath11 ) would lead to suppression of the higher multiplicity events in the region of the small transverse distances . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically , only reflective elastic scattering would survive at small values of the impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> a standard assumption in many geometrical approaches is that the distribution of the mean number of the secondary particles over impact parameter is supposed to have a maximum in the region @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> combination of these two facts is translated ( due to integration over impact parameter ) to slowing down energy dependence of the mean multiplicity @xmath1 at the energies when the inelastic overlap function @xmath11 starts to be peripheral . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental measurements of the mean multiplicity in the energy region of @xmath36 tev would be interesting and helpful for discrimination of the different modes of hadron interaction and would provide hints for the asymptotics . </S>"
