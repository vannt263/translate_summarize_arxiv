    "the recent discovery of a unique , strongly relativistic binary pulsar ( burgay et al . 2003 ) that is also the first eclipsing , double pulsar system found in our galaxy ( lyne et al .",
    "2004 ) promises to provide us with more impressive tests of general relativity than ever before ( kramer 2004 ) , to greatly improve our understanding of magnetospheric and pulsar emission physics ( lyutikov 2004 ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "2004 ; demorest et al . 2004 ; granot & mszros 2004 ; arons et al . 2004 ) , and possibly indicates a realistic chance for the detection of gravitational waves from double - neutron - star ( dns ) inspiral with the first - generation of ground - based interferometers ( kalogera et al .",
    "2004 ; kim et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "apart from the binary pulsar and eclipsing behavior , psr0737 - 3039 sets the current records for dns properties : for example , it has the shortest spin and orbital period , smallest eccentricity , lowest magnetic field , and fastest apsidal motion .",
    "the measured current orbital parameters and masses along with an estimate of the system s age have allowed the careful account of its recent evolutionary history , since the time just before the supernova ( sn ) that formed pulsar b , the current companion to the millisecond pulsar a ( willems & kalogera 2004 ; dewi & van den heuvel 2004 ) . in willems & kalogera ( 2004 ) ( hereafter paper i ) , we found that the pre - sn binary most likely consisted of the first - formed ns and a roche - lobe - filling helium star with mass between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( cf.dewi & van den heuvel 2004 ) .",
    "the pre - sn orbital separation can be constrained between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the magnitude of the kick velocity between 60kms@xmath3 and 1560kms@xmath3 .",
    "most recently , scintillation observations of pulsar a have allowed the measurement of the two systemic velocity components in the reference frame of the orbital plane projected on the sky ( ransom et al.2004 ) .",
    "this measurement gives us the first glimpse of the kinematic evolutionary history ( in addition to that related to binary evolution ) .",
    "therefore we extend the analysis presented in paper i and take a comprehensive approach to constraining the formation of psrj0737 - 3039 .",
    "the concept is similar to that adopted by wex , kalogera , & kramer ( 2000 ) with two main differences : ( i ) at present there is no constraint on pulsar a s spin tilt from timing or polarization observations ; ( ii ) the current kinematic measurements involve two free parameters , the orientation of the orbital plane on the sky ( @xmath0 ) and the radial component of the systemic velocity ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "we note that our predicted spin tilts can also be used along with polarization observations to anticipate the most likely timing of pulsar a s disappearance due to geodetic precession as a function of the radial velocity ( which in the long term will be the only remaining unknown property ) of the system .",
    "in addition to psrj0737 - 3039 ( section  [ sec0737 ] ) , we analyze our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the other two close currently known dns systems in the galaxy . for psrb1534 + 12",

    "we also derive the probability distributions of the kick magnitude imparted to the last - born ns ( section  [ sec1913 ] ) .",
    "we end with a summary of our main conclusions , a discussion of the implications of our analysis for the relation of kicks to spin orientations , and a comparison of our results with other recent studies .",
    "in this section , we use the scintillation velocities measured by ransom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to first determine the spatial velocity of psrj0737 - 3039 with respect to a frame of reference locked to the galaxy and next follow the motion of the system in the galaxy backwards in time until the time of its formation .",
    "we identify crossings of the galactic plane as possible birth sites and , by subtracting the local galactic rotational velocity from the total systemic velocity at birth , determine the system s post - sn peculiar velocity .",
    "this velocity is subsequently used to tighten the progenitor constraints derived in paper  i.    the physical parameters of psrj0737 - 3039 relevant to this investigation are summarized in table  [ param ] .",
    "we particularly note that we use the estimate @xmath45myr of the time since pulsar  a left the maximum spin - up line as an _ upper limit _ for the age of the system ( for details , see paper  i ) .",
    "the interstellar scintillation measurements carried out by ransom et al .  ( 2004 ) yield two of the three systemic velocity components required to describe the space motion of psrj0737 - 3039 .",
    "both components are measured in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight and with respect to the earth .",
    "the first one has a magnitude of @xmath46 and is directed along the line connecting the ascending and descending node of the pulsar s orbit , while the second one has a magnitude of @xmath47 and is directed perpendicular to the nodal line . in what follows , we will refer to these two components as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "since the statistical errors of @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not account for unknown systematic errors , we here adopt the values @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and assume an uncertainty on both components of @xmath54 ( ransom 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "before we pass on from the scintillation velocity components to velocity components with respect to a frame of reference locked to the galaxy , it is interesting to examine the velocity components @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and the corresponding proper motion components @xmath17 and @xmath20 , in right ascension ( @xmath9 ) and declination ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the velocity components @xmath55 and @xmath56 are obtained from @xmath48 and @xmath49 by means of the transformation formulae @xmath57 where @xmath0 is the _ unknown _ longitude of the ascending node measured right - handed around the line - of - sight , from the east through the north .",
    "the proper motion components @xmath58 and @xmath59 are then given by the relations @xmath60 where @xmath33 is the distance of the binary from the sun .",
    "the variations of @xmath55 ( or @xmath17 ) and @xmath56 ( or @xmath20 ) are shown in fig.[vad ] as a function of the unknown @xmath0 .",
    "the dark and light gray bands indicate the errors in @xmath55 ( or @xmath17 ) and @xmath56 ( or @xmath20 ) corresponding to errors of 10 and 20kms@xmath3 in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ranges from approximately @xmath61 to @xmath62 , while , for a distance of 0.6kpc , the magnitude of @xmath17 and @xmath20 can be anywhere between @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see also ransom et al .",
    "2004 ) . a 100mas proper motion",
    "should then be detectable in less than 2 years time .",
    "it is furthermore clear that , even with the extended error bars of @xmath65 , future measurements of the proper motion will considerably constrain the possible values of the longitude of the ascending node @xmath0 .",
    "since the scintillation velocity measurements only give the magnitude of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the motion of the binary projected on the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight should , in principal , be considered in four different directions corresponding to four different combinations of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this additional degree of freedom may however be incorporated in the unknown longitude of the ascending node . to illustrate this , we consider two sets of scintillation velocity components @xmath68 and @xmath69 whose orientations in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight are determined by the angles @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from eqs .",
    "( [ pm1 ] ) , it then follows that the two sets of scintillation velocity components give rise to equal velocity components in right ascension and declination when @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is determined by @xmath74 hence , the cases @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , can be obtained from the case @xmath78 by translating @xmath0 over angles of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , respectively . for the remainder of the paper ,",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to presenting the results associated with the velocity components @xmath52 and @xmath82 .      in order to trace the galactic motion of psrj0737 - 3039 back in time until the time of its formation",
    ", we first need to determine the three velocity components of the current systemic velocity in a reference frame locked to the galaxy . for this purpose , we choose a right - handed frame @xmath83 with the origin at the galactic center and with the @xmath84-plane coinciding with the galactic plane .",
    "we adopt the direction from the sun to the galactic center as the positive direction of the @xmath85-axis and the direction of the sun s motion due to the galactic rotation as the positive direction of the @xmath86-axis .",
    "the components @xmath87 of the current systemic velocity with respect to @xmath83 are obtained by the vector transformation @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the galactic velocity of the sun , @xmath90 is the jacobian of the coordinate transformation linking @xmath91 to @xmath92 , and @xmath4 is the _ unknown _ radial velocity .",
    "the galactic velocity of the sun in turn is the vector sum of the sun s circular velocity around the galactic center and the sun s peculiar velocity with respect to the local standard of rest : @xmath93 ( binney & dehnen 1997 , bienaym 1999 ) .",
    "it is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ pm1 ] ) and  ( [ uvw ] ) that the kinematic evolution of psrj0737 - 3039 depends on two unknown parameters : @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the variations of @xmath94 and @xmath95 as functions of @xmath0 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ vxvz ] , for @xmath96 , -1250 , @xmath97 , 1500kms@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath98kms@xmath3 , @xmath94 is always positive so that the motion of the system backwards in time is away from the galactic center .",
    "in addition , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath95 is positive for all considered values of @xmath4 so that the motion of the system backwards in time is also away from the galactic plane . as we will see below",
    ", this behaviour together with the current position of the system below the galactic plane has important consequences for the past motion of psrj0737 - 3039 in the galactic potential and the identification of possible birth places .    given the present position and velocity components of psrj0737 - 3039 in the adopted reference frame , we integrate the equations governing the system s motion in the galaxy backwards in time and look for possible birth sites as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath4 . since dns systems are thought to form from primordial binaries with initially two massive component stars , which are known to have a very small vertical scale height of 5070pc , we assume the primordial binary to be born in the galactic disk .",
    "wex et al .",
    "( 2000 ) furthermore noted that both the orbital velocity before the birth of the first ns and the center - of - mass velocity imparted to the system due to the first sn explosion are typically of the order of only a few 10kms@xmath3 ( see also brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ; pfahl et al .",
    "however , pfahl et al . ( 2002 ) used a population synthesis technique to construct a probability distribution of post - sn peculiar velocities of high - mass x - ray binaries and found a low - probability tail extending all the way up to @xmath101kms@xmath3 .",
    "the possibility that the first sn explosion in psrj0737 - 3039 produced a kick of a few 100kms@xmath3 to the binary s center - of - mass can therefore not be entirely ruled out . in order to properly treat these cases , the effect of both the first and second sn explosion on the space motion of the binary",
    "must be taken into account , which requires the introduction of three additional free parameters ( magnitude of the first sn kick , direction of the first sn kick relative to that of the second kick , and time expired between the two kicks ) . in view of this added complexity and the low probability of the high systemic velocities after the first sn explosion , we here leave aside these more complicated and rarer cases and assume the present kinematic properties of psrj0737 - 3039 to be entirely due to the second sn explosion .",
    "in particular , we assume that the system was still close to the galactic plane at the time of the second sn explosion and that its pre - sn _ peculiar _ velocity was small in comparison to the galactic rotational velocity at the formation site .",
    "the post - sn systemic velocity of the binary is then given by the sum of the local galactic rotational velocity and the peculiar velocity due to the second sn explosion .",
    "following wex et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we use the galactic potential of kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) to calculate the motion of psrj0737 - 3039 in the galaxy backwards in time for all possible @xmath0-values between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and @xmath4-values between -1500 and 1500kms@xmath3 .",
    "each time the binary crosses the galactic plane ( z=0 ) , we check whether the crossing occurred less than 100myr in the past and whether the crossing point is within 15kpc from the galactic center .",
    "if so , the crossing is considered as a possible birth site and the post - sn peculiar velocity @xmath104 is determined by subtracting the local galactic rotational velocity from the system s total systemic velocity for @xmath105 ; where the correct values are @xmath106 for both @xmath107 and 3 .",
    "we corrected this error and confirmed that it does not quantitatively affect the results presented by wex at al .",
    "( 2000 ) for psrb1913 + 16 ( see also section  [ sec1913 ] ) . in particular , the resulting relative errors on the times of the galactic plane crossings and the associated peculiar velocities are less than @xmath108 . ] .    in cases",
    "where the binary crosses the galactic plane within 1kpc from the galactic center , we assume that the pre - sn binary belonged to the disk - like component of the galactic bulge ( see , e.g. , kuijken & rich 2002 ) .",
    "since the time required by a massive binary to evolve into a dns is at most of the order of @xmath109myr , much smaller than the typical age of pure galactic bulge stars , we exclude birth sites in the bulge at @xmath110 .",
    "hence , all disk crossings within 100myr in the past and within 15kpc from the galactic center are considered as possible birth sites and are assumed to follow the disk - like rotation curve determined by the adopted galactic potential .",
    "the time in the past at which the system crosses the galactic disk provides an estimate for the time since the formation of the dns .",
    "since some of the galactic trajectories cross the galactic plane more than once , these kinematic ages are not uniquely determined by @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , we find that the system may have crossed the galactic plane twice within the last 100myr ; while for @xmath113 and @xmath114 it may have even crossed the galactic plane as much as three times .",
    "since the latter situation only occurs for just a few , greatly fine - tuned trajectories at ages very close to the adopted upper limit of 100myr , we leave aside these rather rare cases and focus on the first and second galactic plane crossings",
    ". we will refer to these crossings as case  a and case  b , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the kinematic age @xmath115 on both @xmath0 and @xmath4 is displayed in figs .",
    "[ tauk1 ] and  [ tauk3 ] : fig .",
    "[ tauk1 ] shows the kinematic ages for all considered @xmath0- and @xmath4-values using a linear gray scale ( color in the electronic edition ) , while fig .",
    "[ tauk3 ] gives a more detailed view of the dependence of @xmath115 on @xmath4 for some specific values of @xmath0 .",
    "for case  a , the majority of the galactic disk crossings occur less than 20myr in the past .",
    "these young ages are associated with longitudes of the ascending node between @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and radial velocities larger than approximately -1000kms@xmath3 .",
    "galactic disk crossings occurring more than 20myr in the past are typically associated with @xmath0-values smaller than @xmath118 or larger than @xmath119 , and with @xmath4-values between -200kms@xmath3 and 700kms@xmath3 .",
    "the range of possible @xmath4-values becomes narrower with increasing kinematic ages and is most restricted when the age of the system is close to the adopted upper limit of 100myr .",
    "there are furthermore almost no disk crossings associated with negative @xmath4-values when @xmath120myr .",
    "the origin of this systematic behavior is related to the dependence of the @xmath85- and @xmath121-components of the current peculiar velocity on @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ vxvz ] ) : the galactic position of the system is such that negative @xmath1-values correspond to orbits where the first disk crossing occurs either too far in the past ( in excess of even the characteristic age of @xmath122myr ) or too far away from the galactic center ( at radii in excess of 15kpc ) .",
    "the disk crossings associated with negative @xmath4-values and @xmath123myr occur due to the suitable orientation of the orbit in space : the @xmath0-values ( @xmath124 ) are such that the @xmath121-component of the current peculiar velocity is negative , so that motion backwards in time is towards the galactic plane . in addition , lorimer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) recently estimated the age of the system to be most likely between 30myr and 70myr . if the age is indeed so constrained , the range of possible @xmath0-values would be limited to @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and the range of possible @xmath4-values to @xmath127 . in view of the current uncertainties",
    "we will perform our analysis for the upper limit of 100myr , but the above age constraints may be kept in mind .    case  b disk crossings , on the other hand , only occur for @xmath4-values between 0kms@xmath3 and @xmath128 , and @xmath0-values between @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the associated kinematic ages are always longer than 20myr , so that constraining the age to 3070myr does not impose severe additional limits on the ranges of @xmath0- and @xmath4-values .    in fig .",
    "[ vcm1 ] , we show the peculiar velocities @xmath104 associated with the galactic plane crossings at ages shown in fig .",
    "[ tauk1 ] .",
    "the peculiar velocities range from 90kms@xmath3 to 1550kms@xmath3 and from 120kms@xmath3 to 800kms@xmath3 , for case  a and  b , respectively .",
    "however , when @xmath131myr , the post - sn peculiar velocities associated with case  a are also confined to a smaller interval between 90kms@xmath3 and 800kms@xmath3 . in addition , for a given value of @xmath0 , the peculiar velocity @xmath104 generally increases with increasing absolute values of @xmath4 . in section  [ ss0737 ]",
    ", we will use the post - sn peculiar velocities to further constraint the properties of the pre - sn progenitor of psrj0737 - 3039 derived in paper  i.    we conclude this section by noting that , if psrj0737 - 3039 is indeed born in the galactic disk , figs .",

    "we extend the analysis presented in paper  i by adding the kinematic history of psrj0737 - 3039 to the constraints resulting from the orbital dynamics of asymmetric , instantaneous sn explosions . the two main differences with paper",
    "i are that ( i ) the problem is now expressed as a function of the two unknown parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 , and ( ii ) the spin - down age @xmath132 is now used as an upper limit for the age instead of as an actual age estimate .",
    "the first difference implies that the constraints will also become functions of @xmath0 and @xmath4 , while the second difference affects the amount of orbital evolution that may have taken place since the birth of the system .    as in paper",

    "<S> in view of the recent measurement of the scintillation velocity for psrj0737 - 3039 , we examine the complete set of constraints imposed on the pulsar b natal kicks ( magnitude and orientation ) and predict the most favorable pulsar kick velocity and spin tilt for both isotropic and polar kicks . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis takes into account both currently unknown parameters : the orientation of the orbital plane on the sky ( @xmath0 ) and the radial component of the systemic velocity ( @xmath1 ) . assuming that the system s peculiar velocity is entirely due to the second supernova explosion , we find that the system may have crossed the galactic plane multiple times since the birth of the second neutron star and that the post - supernova peculiar velocity could have been as high as @xmath2kms@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the absolute lower and upper limits on the physical parameters derived in our earlier study . </S>",
    "<S> for specific combinations of the two unknown parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 , however , we find much tighter constraints on the pre - supernova binary configuration and natal kicks imparted to pulsar b , as well as on the age of system . once @xmath0 is measured in the coming year , it will be straightforward to use the results presented here to further constrain the natal kicks and the spin - tilt predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we complete our comprehensive study and derive similar constraints and spin - tilt predictions for psrb1534 + 12 , where the only free parameter is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , for psrb1913 + 16 , we update the progenitor and kick constraints using the measured pulsar spin tilt and allowing for roche - lobe overflow from the progenitor of the pulsar companion . </S>"
