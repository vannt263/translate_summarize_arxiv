    "in recent years , the results from supernova ia have shown that the expansion of our universe is accelerating unlike the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models with nonrelativistic matter and radiation @xcite . also , the cosmic background radiation data imply that our universe is in positively accelerated state @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath0 as the usual vacuum energy may be responsible for this accelerating evolution of the universe with the negative pressure .",

    "recently , various studies have been done in the literature , such as cosmology with the chaplygin gas to explain the transition from a dust - dominated universe to the accelerating expansion stage @xcite , modified generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , modified cosmic chaplygin gas @xcite , and phenomenological relations between brane - world scenarios and frw minisuperspace cosmologies in the presence of the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the idea of an early chaplygin gas phase in the universe was first suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite and later extended in refs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the generalized chaplygin gas has a connection with string theory .",
    "it can be effectively obtained in the light cone parametrization from the nambu - goto action for a @xmath8-brane in a ( @xmath9,1)-dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "this motivates the application of the generalized chaplygin gas model at early time in the evolution of the universe .",
    "in particular , the chaplygin inflation is addressed in ref .",

    "this allows us to use the similarities between the quantum cosmology of a brane - world model and the chaplygin gas quantum cosmology .",
    "recently , a single - field inflation scenario is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the properties of the inflaton field areequivalent to a generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "based on the measurements released by the planck data and the wmap large - angle polarization , it is found that the @xmath5 parameter is given by @xmath11 @xcite . in ref .",

    "after the universe reached the dust - dominated stage , the exponentially expanding evolution of the universe represents a quantum mechanical transition with some remnant component of the original wave function of the universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a quantum mechanical background behind the classically observed universe on large scales during the dust dominance epoch which is based on the cosmological influence of a rapidly oscillating wave function with a small amplitude .",

    "the potentials @xmath13 and @xmath16 do not have clear physical meaning .",
    "moreover , the four - velocity obeys the usual normalization , namely , @xmath19 .    the velocity potential version of the perfect fluid is based on the variational principle with the following lagrangian density @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ricci curvature scalar in four dimensions , @xmath3 is the pressure of the perfect fluid , and @xmath22 is determinate of the four - metric .",
    "variation of this action with respect to the metric gives rise to the einstein field equations , and the variation with respect to each of the velocity potentials yields the equations of motion for the potentials @xcite .",

    "a new theory of gravity presented by hoava is based on the asymmetry scaling of space @xmath27 and time @xmath28 , where it is characterized by a scaling parameter @xmath29 and the dynamical critical exponent @xmath30 as @xcite @xmath31 the resulting theory , the so - called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity , is proved to be power - countable renormalizable .",
    "this theory is based on the assumption that higher spatial - derivative correction terms such as different powers of the spatial curvature and its derivatives could be added to the standard einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this result leads to improvement in the uv behavior of the graviton propagator , but the lorentz invariance as a fundamental symmetry of theory is broken @xcite .",
    "hoava made an important assumption about the lapse function which simplified the hl gravitational action , the so - called `` projectability condition , '' as @xmath32 .",
    "projectable theories lead to a unique integrated hamiltonian constraint , which also cause great complications when they are compared with general relativity . on the other hand , as in general relativity ,",
    "nonprojectable theories give rise to a local hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "however , since frw spacetime is homogeneous and isotropic , the spatial integral can be dropped from the integrated hamiltonian constraint @xcite which results in a true local constraint even for the projectable case .",
    "thus , in our study it is sufficient to consider the frw - hl projectable theory as the starting point .",
    "another assumption that is introduced by hoava is the principle of detailed balance .",
    "based on this condition , the potential in the gravitation action is originated from the gradient flow generated by a three - dimensional action and reduces the number of independent coupling constants .",
    "notice that it has been recently found that the detailed balance condition can also be relaxed @xcite .    when the spacetime is asymmetric ( [ eq4 ] ) , the dimensions of space and time are different , namely , @xmath33=[\\kappa]^{-1},\\qquad[t]=[\\kappa]^{-z},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a placeholder symbol with the dimensions of momentum . for general values of @xmath30 ,",

    "the full hl action that we consider throughout the paper is @xmath50 where we set @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the einstein field equations can be classified with respect to the type of singularities as follows : ( a ) quasiregular singularities : the observer measures no divergent physical quantity , except when its world line arrives at the singularity , e.g. , the conical singularity of a cosmic string .",
    "( b ) scalar curvature singularities : the observer feels diverging tidal forces when approaching the singularity , e.g. , the singularity inside a black hole and the big bang singularity in frw cosmology .",

    "since this fact is unavoidable in general relativity , it is hoped that the quantum theory of gravitation will solve this issue and lead to the avoidance of the singularities in the quantum domain . in spite of the nonexistence of the completely acceptable theory of quantum gravity , it is shown that various approaches that combine the laws of quantum mechanics with the general relativity could be able to partially solve this problem @xcite .    in this paper",

    ", the variable associated to the degrees of freedom of matter plays the role of time and leads to a well - define hilbert space structure .",
    "notice that the proposed approach is a poor approximation of the real dynamics of reducing the brane physics into hoava - lifshitz gravity plus the generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "moreover , the hl gravity model is not fully compatible with general relativity , but it is discussed in order to show that a period of inflation can be obtained . indeed , the hl theory does not exactly recover general relativity at low energy .",
    "however , it mimics general relativity plus dark matter @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "[ secb ] , we found classical behavior for small values of the scale factor and a quantum behavior for its large values . this unexpected result is also observed in the frw , stephani , and kaluza - klein models in the context of general relativity .",
    "the bouncing behavior of the expectation value of the scale factor could be related to the existence of a minimal length scale @xmath235 ^ 2 \\left(\\frac{16(3\\lambda-1)p_t}{3}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ ] which is suggested by various proposals of quantum gravity . in sec .",
    "[ secf ] , we found that the evolution of the wave function of the universe is uniquely determined by the initial wave packet , i.e. , no boundary condition at @xmath234 is necessary in hl quantum cosmology .    among various",
    "presented solutions , solutions ( [ airycl6 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath236 and ( [ whittakercl6 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath237^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ ] which show the accelerated expansion of the universe , namely , @xmath238 , could match the inflation scenario .",
    "in particular , solution ( [ airycl6 ] ) tends to the power - law inflation @xmath239 and solution ( [ whittakercl6 ] ) tends to the exponential inflation @xmath240 .",
    "observational data of the cosmic microwave background strongly indicate that the primordial cosmological perturbations have an almost scale - invariant spectrum . in general relativity ( @xmath241 )",
    ", the scale invariance also requires inflation .",
    "indeed , for this case , the scale invariance is nothing but the constancy of the hubble expansion rate @xmath242 which leads to @xmath243 . for general @xmath30 , the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the scalar field in",
    "hl gravity reads @xcite @xmath244 where @xmath245 is some energy scale .",
    "for @xmath37 it is reduced to @xmath246 , which means that the amplitude of quantum fluctuations does not depend on the hubble expansion rate . in other words ,",
    "the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in hoava - lifshitz gravity with @xmath247 is automatically scale invariant even without inflation .",
    "in fact , the power law expansion @xmath248 with @xmath249 satisfies the condition . in our study , solutions ( [ acl9 ] ) , ( [ airycl6 ] ) , and ( [ whittakercl6 ] ) satisfy this condition .",
    "notice that although solution ( [ acl9 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath250 , is not an accelerating solution , it results in the scale - invariant spectrum in hl gravity .",
    "we would like to thank babak vakili and homa shababi for insightful comments and suggestions .",
