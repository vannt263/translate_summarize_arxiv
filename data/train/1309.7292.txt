    "the primary aim of this work is to develop an algorithm to convert a continuous potential to an optimal discrete form : one that provides an accurate approximation of the original continuous potential and can be simulated at a minimal computational cost . as the computational cost of an event - driven simulation is roughly proportional to the number of discontinuities encountered by the particles , it is vital that the number of discontinuities or steps used to achieve a set level of accuracy is minimized .",
    "the location of a single step @xmath3 in a spherically - symmetric discrete potential is specified by the segment @xmath12 $ ] between the @xmath3th and @xmath13th discontinuities .",
    "the discontinuities , located at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , bounding each step are also the limits of the neighboring steps .",
    "a simplification made in this work is to require that each step is directly representative of the segment of the continuous potential lying within the same limits @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this allows the task of discretizing the potential to be split into two smaller tasks : the optimal placement of discontinuities and the determination of an effective step energy for a segment of the continuous potential .",
    "it is common to accelerate molecular dynamics calculations by truncating the interaction potential at a cut - off radius @xmath16 , thus requiring only local particle pairings to be considered in force calculations .",
    "typically in simulations of continuous potentials , the potential is also shifted to eliminate the discontinuity at the cutoff in order to avoid the presence of impulsive forces .",
    "for example , the truncated , shifted lennard - jones potential is given by @xmath17    as each step of the discontinuous potential represents a segment of the original continuous potential , the first discontinuity is defined to lie at the cutoff radius ( i.e.  @xmath18 ) , while all other discontinuities lie within in the region @xmath19 .",
    "it is tempting to also define an inner hard - core radius of the stepped potential using one of the available methods ( e.g. , see ref .  ) ; however , this would require each step energy to somehow compensate for the overly repulsive core , inextricably linking step placement and energy once again .",
    "the available methods for placing discontinuities are reviewed in the next section before the algorithms used to generate representative step energies are discussed .",
    "the simplest approach to place the discontinuities of a discrete potential is to divide the region @xmath19 into a number of steps of equal width @xmath20",
    "@xcite . @xmath21 the total number of discontinuities / steps in the potential ( including the cutoff ) is given by @xmath22 .",
    "it is not immediately clear that a uniform radial placement of the steps is the natural choice for a spherical potential .",
    "an alternative choice is to fix the volume @xmath23 bounded by each step of the potential . in this case",
    ", each step location is determined using the following recursive expression @xmath24 the total number of discontinuities in the potential is then @xmath25 .",
    "the primary disadvantage of the approaches outlined above is that they do not attempt to adapt the step locations according to the behavior of the potential .",
    "it is likely that the performance of both algorithms is particularly sensitive to the configuration of the steps near the minimum of the potential where the interaction energy changes rapidly .",
    "it has also been proposed  @xcite to discretize continuous potentials by placing discontinuities at fixed intervals of interaction energy @xmath26 .",
    "this approach allows a controlled resolution of the potential , while balancing the contribution of each step and allows a straightforward extension to asymmetric potentials .",
    "the locations of the discontinuities are the ordered solutions to the following set of equations @xmath27 the application of eq .   to the shifted , truncated lennard - jones potential results in an infinite number of steps due to the singularity at @xmath28 .",
    "in practice , the high - energy steps are inaccessible and only a small number need to be computed during the simulation .    before these approaches can be evaluated , a technique for determining the step energies must be selected .",
    "this is discussed in the following section .      with the location of each step defined through one of the above algorithms , an algorithm for determining the effective energy of a segment of the potential",
    "is required . in the limit of a large number of discontinuities",
    "/ small segments , the original continuous potential must be recovered .",

    "@xcite report that mid - point sampling ( @xmath31 ) of the underlying continuous potential is the most effective at reproducing the original behavior of the lennard - jones potential , whereas left sampling is more appropriate for the yukawa potential .",
    "it is easy to define other methods of point sampling , such as the minimum edge energy used by van zon and schofield  @xcite .",
    "a logical choice is to sample the potential at the distance which divides the step into two equal volumes .",
    "@xmath32^{1/3}\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is also possible to define alternative approaches which do not rely on point - sampling , such as an equal area approach  @xcite ; however , it is more desirable to directly match the thermodynamic properties of the converted potentials .",
    "unfortunately , matching properties , such as the pressure , would require the use of an accurate free energy , which is typically unavailable .",
    "successful attempts have been made to adjust stepped potentials to directly match the predictions of the tpt to experimental data for a range of thermodynamic properties  @xcite ; however , the resulting equation of state is still approximate and the expressions are rather complicated . in this work ,",
    "the focus is on directly reproducing the properties of the continuous potential system .",
    "one simple approach is to use the lowest order density correction to both the pressure and free - energy , given by the second virial coefficient , which is directly calculated from the interaction potential .",
    "the contribution of a segment of the potential to the second virial may be calculated as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the absolute temperature of the system , and @xmath36 is the boltzmann constant . the energy of the step can then be set to match the contribution to the second virial coefficient for the corresponding segment of the continuous potential , using the following expression @xmath37 application of this algorithm leads to excellent agreement at low densities for the pressure ; however , the algorithm has a cumbersome dependence on the temperature , which may not be available _ a priori _ ( e.g. , in the microcanonical ensemble ) . in the high - temperature limit , equating the virial contribution reduces to taking a volume average of the energy within a step : @xmath38 this indicates that a volume - averaged approach will also yield a good reproduction of the pressure near the ideal gas limit of high - temperature and low - density .",
    "it should be noted that both virial and volume - averaging approaches will set an infinite energy for the innermost step of the lennard - jones potential due to the singularity at @xmath28 .",
    "this can have a dramatic effect on the potential as the step placement algorithms in eqs .   and use a finite number of steps to represent the repulsive core .",
    "to compare the various methods for mapping potentials , molecular dynamics simulations of @xmath39 discontinuous and continuous lennard - jones particles with @xmath40 were performed over a range of densities , @xmath41 , and temperatures , @xmath42 . to collect thermodynamic properties , each simulation was run for @xmath43 for equilibration before five production runs of @xmath44 were used to collect averages and",
    "obtain estimates of the uncertainty .",

    "averages are reported here with error bars corresponding to the standard deviation between runs .",
    "simulations for the continuous truncated , shifted lennard - jones potential were performed using the espresso  @xcite package with a time step of @xmath46 and a langevin thermostat with a friction parameter of @xmath47 .",
    "discrete potential simulations were performed using the dynamo  @xcite package with an andersen thermostat controlled to @xmath48% of the overall events . during the collection of dynamical properties ,",
    "the thermostat is disabled after the equilibration period and the temperature is monitored to ensure it remains within @xmath49% of the set value .",
    "the mapping procedures must be evaluated on a basis of accuracy as a function of computational cost . as event - driven simulators process events at a constant rate , the computational cost is proportional to the number of events that must be processed per unit of simulation time .",
    "each additional discontinuity within the potential will generate additional events provided particle pairs can access it ; therefore , the computational cost is dominated by the number of discontinuities in the well of the potential .",
    "a straightforward parameter for the order of approximation of the potential , @xmath50 , can then be defined for each step placement algorithm as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the location of the minimum of the lennard - jones potential .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 is continuous , and as @xmath53 , the continuous lennard - jones potential is recovered .",
    "the integer part of @xmath50 corresponds to the number of discontinuities in the attractive section of the potential and at whole integer values of @xmath50 , a discontinuity is placed at the minimum of the potential .      the methods for placing the discontinuities of a discrete potential ( eq .   )",
    "are evaluated first .",

    "the radial and volumetric placement algorithms are particularly sensitive to the order of approximation . for example",
    ", the volumetric algorithm is only accurate for the internal energy at integer values of @xmath50 which correspond to a discontinuity placed at the minimum of the potential .",
    "this highlights the importance of a good approximation of the potential in this region at high densities .",

    "the use of stepped potentials will eliminate some of the overhead of hybrid techniques which indicates promising future applications of the potentials developed here in rarefied gas flow simulation .",
    "the comparison carried out here is only for serial execution performance ; however , parallel algorithms for event - driven simulation exhibit good scaling  @xcite and will be evaluated in future .",
    "the relative calculation - speed ( simulation time processed per unit of cpu time ) of time - stepping ( ts ) and event - driven ( ed ) molecular dynamics for a lennard - jones isotherm at @xmath54 .",
    "symbols correspond to different stepped approximations . ]",
    "in this work , we have examined several methods for mapping a continuous interaction potential to a discrete , stepped potential .",
    "these methods were compared on their ability of the resulting discrete potential to reproduce the thermodynamic and transport properties of the continuous potential system over a broad range of conditions . of the various methods which were examined to locate the discontinuities of the potential ,",
    "the best was found to be at fixed intervals of energy . setting the step energy through a volume average of the energy of the underlying continuous potential appears to give the a good overall approximation provided @xmath71 and an excellent approximation for @xmath88 .",
    "the computational cost for simulating the continuous potential and several levels of stepped potential approximation were compared on the basis of their processing rates for a unit of simulation time .",
    "this is dependent on the particular algorithms used to perform each of the simulations , and , consequently , the implementation of different algorithms may alter the results of this comparison .",
    "stepped lennard - jones potentials are increasingly efficient when compared to continuous forms at gas densities or lower ( @xmath110 which is around @xmath111kgm@xmath112 for argon ) .",
    "this indicates the stepped potentials introduced here may be used to significantly accelerate simulations of shock waves  @xcite or other complex rarefied gas systems where dsmc techniques are currently applied .    in our comparisons",
    ", we have only studied the use of stepped potentials to reproduce the properties of a system where the particles interact with a _ continuous _ potential . in that respect ,",
    "continuous molecular dynamics algorithms are at a distinct advantage as , in order for discrete potentials to properly reproduce the properties of a system interacting with a continuous potential , a fairly large number of steps is required .",
    "models with shorter interaction durations , such as the weeks - chandler - anderson potential , should prove far more efficient targets for conversion , especially given the speed of hard - sphere simulations .",
    "the hertz potential , used in simulations of solids particles  @xcite , is particularly interesting as the stepped equivalent may be arbitrarily steep .",
    "this , combined with the analytic dynamics of the event - driven technique , will allow the stable and efficient use of realistic materials parameters in granular simulations .",
    "the only obstacle to this application is the conversion of the dissipative inter - particle forces which will be explored in a future publication .",
    "finally , in this paper , we have not considered the general question as to whether using a discrete potential is preferable to using a continuous potential for molecular systems .",
    "although the discrete lennard - jones model developed here only appears to be efficient in certain limits , using a carefully chosen discrete coarse - grained potential , with only a few steps and a short interaction range , can potentially lead to a system that is much more rapidly simulated by event - driven md than a continuous potential can be simulated by continuous md .",
    "for example , the use of discrete interaction potentials , along with a combination of event - driven md and thermodynamic perturbation theory , have greatly improved the speed of developing and tuning transferable potential models to accurately reproduce the thermodynamic properties and phase behavior of fluids @xcite .",
    "also , using discrete potential models has allowed the rapid simulation and large , complex biological systems @xcite , such as the dynamics of protein folding @xcite and fibril formation @xcite , over long time scales .",
    "these types of simulations are still difficult to access by current continuous potential techniques and highlight the potential of carefully developed discontinuous models .",
