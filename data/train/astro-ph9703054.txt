    "in addition to the frequency dependence of the foreground emission , there is also a spatial dependence . at the largest angular scales ,",
    "galactic emission falls off with galactic latitude roughly as @xmath14 . in other words , its intensity distribution , to first order , resembles a quadrupole : hot around a circle , cold near the poles .",

    "<S> have advanced to the point where fluctuations in the cmb of order a few microkelvin are measured almost routinely . in these lecture notes , we review recent measurements of both the absolute temperature and the anisotropy of the cmb and discuss the relation between the data and the general theoretical framework . </S>",
    "<S> future directions are indicated and the upcoming satellite experiments are discussed .    </S>"
