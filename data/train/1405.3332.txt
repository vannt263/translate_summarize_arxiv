    "these objects serve as a `` standard candle '' in cosmology @xcite , since their peak luminosity can be predicted from the properties of the optical light curves .",

    "the ejecta are opaque for gamma - ray lines produced in the bulk of the ejecta . at later times",
    "the ejecta become progressively more transparent and a large fraction of gamma - rays escape the ejecta .",

    "the flux from the source contributes only a fraction of a percent to the spi count rate on top of the time - variable ( by tens of % ) detector background .",
    "while precise measurements of line fluxes are challenging , a combination of spectral and imaging information makes our results very robust , although some systematic uncertainties of order @xmath51% should still be allowed for .",
    "the results described in the previous section can be summarized as follows : ( i ) _ integral _ detects significant emission from two brightest gamma - ray lines associated with @xmath0co decay , ( ii ) the lines are significantly broadened , ( iii ) low energy ( @xmath52400 kev ) emission is present .",
    "we now discuss the most basic implications of these results .",
    "while detailed modeling of sn2014j properties is beyond the scope of this letter , we use a simple reference model to qualitatively compare our results with expected gamma - ray emission from a `` canonical '' type ia supernova ( see also @xcite for detailed predictions for a set of commonly used models ) .",
    "our reference model assumes that the total mass of the ejecta is @xmath53 , the kinetic energy of the explosion is @xmath54 , the initial mass of @xmath0ni is @xmath55 and half of the total ejecta mass is composed from iron - group elements .",
    "we ignore possible anisotropy of the @xmath0ni distribution expected in the scenario of wd mergers @xcite .",
    "the density of the homologousely expanding ejecta follows the exponential law @xmath56 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath57 and is truncated at @xmath58 .",
    "all elements are uniformly mixed through the entire ejecta .",
    "the monte - carlo radiative transfer code is used to calculate emergent spectrum , which includes full treatment of the compton scattering ( coherent and incoherent ) and photoabsorption .",
    "pair production by gamma - ray photons is neglected .",
    "the positrons produced by @xmath59 decay of @xmath0co ( 19% of all decays ) annihilate in place via positronium formation and both two - photon annihilation and ortho - positronium continuum are included .",
    "our reference model was calculated for 75th day since the explosion . a time delay due to finite propagation time of the photons",
    "is neglected ( it amounts to few days from the radius where the bulk of the mass is located ) .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of two gamma - ray lines are given in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "since the decay time of @xmath0co @xmath60 and branching ratios ( 1 and 0.66 for 847 and 1238 kev lines respectively ) are known , it is straightforward to convert line fluxes into the mass or @xmath0co , visible to integral at the time of observation ( see table  [ tab : fluxes ] ) .",
    "this value @xmath61 can be considered as a model independent lower limit on the amount of @xmath0co ( or equivalently a lower limit on the initial @xmath0ni mass @xmath62 ) .",
    "the fraction of line photons escaping the ejecta without interactions was estimated from the model : 0.60 ( 847 kev ) and 0.64 ( 1238 kev ) .",
    "these values were used to correct observed fluxes to derive an estimate of the @xmath0co mass @xmath63 at day 75 .",
    "finally a correction factor of 1/0.55 has been applied to convert the mass of @xmath0co at day 75 to the initial mass of @xmath0ni : @xmath64 ( see table  [ tab : fluxes ] ) .",
    "the same data can be used to estimate total energy deposition rate in the sn2014j during integral observations .",
    "total energy released during decay of @xmath0co isotope @xcite is split between neutrinos ( @xmath90.8 mev ) , kinetic energy of positrons ( @xmath90.12 mev ) and gamma - rays ( @xmath93.6 mev ) . in our fiducial model @xmath65% of the luminosity in gamma - rays",
    "escapes the ejecta .",
    "remaining fraction @xmath66% is deposited in the ejecta ( ignoring bremsstrahlung radiation by electrons ) . adding kinetic energy of positrons and 23% of the gamma - ray luminosity produced by @xmath67 of @xmath0co at day 75 yields an estimate of the energy deposition rate in the ejecta @xmath68 , while @xmath69 escape the ejecta in the form of hard x - rays and gamma - rays .",
    "the independent estimate of the @xmath0ni mass can be obtained from the bolometric light curve .",
    "we use the approach prompted by @xcite who found that the bolometric luminosity at the maximum is equal to the power of the radioactive decay at this moment . in the case of sn",
    "2014j the maximum bolometric luminosity is @xmath70 erg s@xmath71 and it is attained on day 17.7 after the explosion @xcite .",
    "this implies the @xmath0ni mass of @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xcite adopt absorption @xmath73 mag whereas @xcite infers the larger absorption , @xmath74 mag .",
    "the latter implies the @xmath0ni mass of @xmath75 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity thus suggests that the @xmath0ni mass of sn  2014j lies the range of @xmath76 .",
    "these values agree with the estimates based on gamma - lines .",
    "the uncertainty of the distance ( @xmath77 mpc , @xcite ) corresponds to the additional uncertainty in mass @xmath78 .",
    "similar uncertainty applies to gamma - ray data .      in a fully transparent ejecta",
    "the centroid of emerging gamma - ray lines should be unshifted ( at least to the first order in @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the speed of light ) .",
    "opacity suppresses gamma - rays coming from the receding part of the ejecta , leading to a blue shift of the visible line .",
    "blue shift is indeed observed for both lines , when fitting their profiles with a gaussian ( see table  [ tab : fluxes ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "corresponding mean velocity is @xmath81 is slightly higher ( by 1.7@xmath13 ) than the expected shift @xmath82 estimated from the model for gamma - ray photons escaping the ejecta without interactions .    the expected line broadening ( rms of the line - of - sight ( l.o.s ) velocity ) @xmath43 for transparent ejecta is directly related to the characteristic expansion velocity @xmath83 . indeed , in the model we found for directly escaping photons @xmath84 .",
    "the gaussian fit to the observed lines yields @xmath85 and provides an estimate of @xmath86 .",
    "finally , at lower energies ( 100 - 400 kev ) the emerging flux is dominated by compton scattering of 847 and 1238 kev photons and the ortho - positronium continuum from positrons annihilation ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_late ] ) .",
    "the strength of the signal in this band depends on the intensity of the gamma - ray lines ( @xmath87 ) , on the thomson depth of the ejecta ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) and on the chemical composition of the ejecta , since photoabsorption cuts off the lower energy side of the spectrum at @xmath90  kev .",
    "the value of the flux seen in the 200 - 400 kev band is in agreement with the predictions of the fiducial model .",
    "the overall shape of the spectrum ( spi+isgri data , see fig.[fig : spec_late ] ) can be well fitted by other models having a ratio @xmath91 , while the data place weaker constraints on @xmath92 and @xmath88 separately .",
    "this ratio corresponds to @xmath93 , i.e. slightly higher than the value derived from line fitting . allowing for systematic uncertainties and accounting for simplicity of the fitting functions we consider that the agreement is reasonable .",
    "the detection of key gamma - ray lines of radioactive cobalt @xmath0co provides solid proof of the interpretation of type ia supernova as a thermonuclear explosion of near - chandrasekhar - mass wd .",
    "there is broad agreement between the observed fluxes and line broadening with the canonical model of the snia at the stage when the decay of @xmath0co dominates .",
    "more thorough comparison of the integral data with the detailed models of emerging gamma - ray flux and optical data to differentiate between different explosion scenarios will be presented in subsequent publications .",
    "based on observations with integral , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , switzerland , spain ) , czech republic and poland , and with the participation of russia and the usa .",
    "we are grateful to esa integral team and erik kuulkers for prompt reaction to the sn2014j event .",
    "ec , rs , sg wish to thank russian integral advisory committee for allocating additional 1  msec of time from a regular program to sn2014j observations .",

    "the spi project has been completed under the responsibility and leadership of cnes / france .",
    "isgri has been realized by cea with the support of cnes .",
    "the data analysis follows the scheme implemented in @xcite . for each detector ,",
    "a linear relation between the energy and the channel number was assumed and calibrated ( separately for each orbit ) , using the observed energies of lines at @xmath9 198 , 438 , 584 , 882 , 1764 , 1779 , 2223 and 2754 kev . for our analysis",
    "we used a combination of single and pulse - shape - discriminator ( psd ) events and treated them in the same way .",
    "the flux from the supernova @xmath94 at energy @xmath95 and the background rates in individual detectors @xmath96 were derived from a simple model of the observed rates @xmath97 in individual spi detectors , where @xmath98 is the detector number and @xmath99 is the time of individual observations with a typical exposure of 2000 s : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the effective area for a given detector as seen from the source position in a given observation and @xmath102 does not depend on time .",
    "the background rate is assumed to be linearly proportional to the ge detectors saturated ( i.e. above 8 mev ) event rate @xmath103 averaged over all detectors , i.e. @xmath104 . the coefficients @xmath94 , @xmath105 and @xmath102 are free parameters of the model and are obtained by minimizing @xmath106 for the entire data set or for any ( sufficiently large ) subset of the data .",
    "a linear nature of the model allows for straightforward estimation of errors .",
    "the systematic uncertainties were evaluated by analyzing the spi data with the method presented in .",
    "the isgri energy calibration use the procedure implemented in osa 10.0 .",
    "the images in broad energy bands were reconstructed using standard mask / detector cross - correlation procedure , tuned to produce zero signal on the sky if the count rate across the detector matches the pattern expected from pure background , which was derived from the same dataset .",
