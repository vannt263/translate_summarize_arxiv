    "hamiltonian structures play a fundamental role in mathematical physics .",
    "it s enough to recall a few examples : classical mechanics , electrodynamics , quantum mechanics , hydrodynamics and general relativity .",
    "however , when applying the classical methods and technics of symplectic geometry to pdes , one faces significant difficulties , both analytical and conceptual .",
    "part of the problem is that symplectic forms that arise in many applications are weak symplectic forms on infinite dimensional manifolds .",
    "more importantly , often integral curves of pdes are not differentiable in time in the function spaces one would normally use ; in the linear case , this corresponds to the fact that the operators involved are unbounded .",
    "stock examples include the euler and klein - gordon equations .",
    "when dealing with such systems one has to pay careful attention to domains of definitions as many standard formulas become only formal relationships .",
    "their justification is often cumbersome and requires some ad hoc methods .",
    "the goal of this paper is to contribute to the development of techniques that are useful for the treatment of nonlinear pdes with non - differentiable ( in time ) solutions and build a framework that allows a systematic and rigorous study of such systems and is applicable to the broad range of physical phenomena .",
    "previous work in this vein is @xcite .",
    "specifically , this article is devoted to the study of the euler equations for an ideal fluid on the compact manifold , the example that provides the main inspiration and motivation .",
    "the goal is to understand in what exact sense ( if any ) the flow generated by euler s equation consists of poisson maps .",
    "since the classic work of arnold @xcite , it has been known that _ formally _ the euler equation could be viewed as a hamiltonian system .",
    "( expositions of this may be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the work of @xcite showed the remarkable fact that in appropriate function spaces , the flow of the euler equations in lagrangian representation ( in sobolev function spaces @xmath6 for @xmath7 ) is given by a smooth vector field and hence all the difficulties are resolved in that context .",
    "this work also shows that one can perform a reduction ( euler - poincar reduction ) to eulerian representation to rigorously derive that the solutions obtained this way satisfy the euler equations ( taking into account one derivative loss due to the reduction procedure ) .    from the work of @xcite , the reduced flow of the euler equations in @xmath6",
    "are known to form a continuous flow in @xmath6 ( both in time and in the initial velocity field ) , and regarded as maps from @xmath6 to @xmath8 , they are @xmath3 .",
    "another remarkable property of the solutions also follows from this same work  namely that the individual particle trajectories are @xmath9 in time , a fact not so easy to see directly in eulerian representation ( see @xcite ) .    while a version of the _ symplectic nature _ of the flow of the euler equations follows directly from the results in @xcite ( taking into account the loss of one derivative ) , it is not so clear that there is a well defined poisson sense for the results .",
    "in fact , the work of @xcite ( and many subsequent papers by other authors ) shows that in the poisson context , this derivative loss is a nontrivial issue in defining a good sense in which one has a poisson manifold and in which the euler equations then define a hamiltonian system in the poisson sense . _",
    "the main purposes of this paper is to fill this gap by means of a nonsmooth lie - poisson reduction procedure on appropriate classes of functions .",
    "_    this article has the following structure . in ",
    "[ s : eulersol ] we give important background information on euler equation and manifolds of diffeomorphisms .",
    "then , we recall the basic ideas of poisson reduction in  [ s : poisson ] .",
    "our results are presented in next two sections . in ",
    "[ s : weakpoisson ] we prove that tangent bundle of a weak riemannian manifold carries a poisson structure in an appropriate sense , provided that the manifold possesses a _ smooth _ riemannian connection .",
    "the later requirement is fulfilled on the groups of diffeomorphisms according to the work of @xcite . in  [ s : eulerflow ] we utilize this result to show that the flow of euler equation is poisson in an appropriate sense .",
    "we conclude with short discussion of presented results in  [ s : future ] .",
    "in this section we present some classical results concerning the euler equation that motivated our study .",
    "the notation and exposition follows @xcite .",
    "the euler equations on compact manifold are traditionally formulated in the following way .",
    "let @xmath10 be a compact riemannian @xmath2-manifold possibly with boundary @xmath11 . find a time dependent vector field @xmath12 , ( which has an associated flow denoted @xmath13 ) such that    1 .",
    "@xmath14 is a given initial condition with @xmath15 2 .",
    "the euler equations hold : @xmath16 for some scalar function @xmath17 ( the pressure ) , 3 .",
    "@xmath18 , and 4 .",
    "@xmath19 is parallel to @xmath11 .",
    "it is standard that above equation can be formally rewritten as an ode on the space of divergence free vector fields with a derivative loss .",
    "but it was discovered by @xcite that this is literally true with no derivative loss in lagrangian representation .",
    "we recall how this proceeds .",
    "let @xmath20 be a volume form on the manifold @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the space of mappings of sobolev class @xmath22 from an @xmath2-manifold @xmath10 to a manifold @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 , let @xmath25 @xmath26 then both @xmath27 are smooth infinite dimensional manifolds and topological groups , moreover @xmath28 is a closed submanifold and a subgroup of @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be the canonical projections and let @xmath32 be the identity element of the groups @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the space of @xmath4 divergence free vector fields on @xmath10 that are parallel to the boundary .",
    "a given riemannian metric on @xmath10 induces a right invariant weak riemannian metric on @xmath28 given by @xmath37 for @xmath38 where scalar product under the integral sign is taken in @xmath10 .    as was shown in @xcite , @xmath28 possesses a smooth riemannian connection and , as a consequence , a smooth spray , which we will denote @xmath39 .",
    "[ t : flow ] for @xmath5 , the weak riemannian metric has a @xmath9 spray @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the ( local , @xmath9 ) flow of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath42 ( the material velocity field ) and @xmath43 ( the particle position field ) .",
    "then the solution of the euler equation with initial condition @xmath44 is given by @xmath45    from the properties of the diffeomorphism group , one sees that this result shows that the euler equations ( [ euler_equations ] ) are well - posed in @xmath6 in eulerian representation .",
    "first , recall the following basic and simple result about poisson reduction ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath46 is a lie group that acts on a poisson manifold @xmath47 and that for each @xmath48 the action map @xmath49 is a poisson map .",
    "suppose that the quotient @xmath50 is a smooth manifold and the projection @xmath51 is a submersion .",
    "then , there is a unique poisson structure @xmath52 on @xmath50 such that @xmath53 is a poisson map .",
    "it is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a poisson bracket in @xmath47 and @xmath56 is a set of smooth functions on @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath57 is a hamiltonian vector field for a g - invariant hamiltonian @xmath58 , then @xmath53 also induces reduction of dynamics .",
    "there is a function @xmath59 such that @xmath60 . since @xmath53 is a poisson map it transforms @xmath57 on @xmath47 to @xmath61 on @xmath50 , that is , @xmath62 .",
    "denoting the flow of @xmath57 by @xmath63 and the flow of @xmath61 by @xmath64 we obtain commutative diagram @xmath65    our strategy is to apply the above procedure to the context of fluids .",
    "to do so , define the map @xmath66 via @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be given by @xmath70 for @xmath71 by proposition [ t : flow ] , @xmath64 is the flow of euler equation on @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 satisfies the euler equations ( [ euler_equations ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the preceding developments that @xmath63 ( as a flow of a spray ) is a flow of hamiltonian vector field on @xmath74 .",
    "the following commutative diagram @xmath75 suggests that the flow of euler equation itself , which is obtained from @xmath63 via poisson reduction , should be a hamiltonian flow in the sense of poisson manifolds and this is certainly formally true ( see , for instance @xcite for both the case considered here as well as the case of free boundary problems ) .",
    "however , as noted in this reference and elsewhere , there are difficulties in finding the right class of functions so that one gets a poisson structure in a precise sense . to justify the formal insight in precise function spaces",
    ", one has to overcome two hurdles .",
    "the first hurdle is that @xmath76 is only a weak symplectic manifold , and therefore does not necessary carry a poisson bracket in any obvious way without special ad hoc hypotheses such as `` the needed functional derivatives exist '' which have long been recognized as awkward at best .",
    "the second hurdle is that @xmath76 is not a lie group in the usual sense ( left multiplication is not smooth ) , and @xmath53 is not a smooth map ( inversion in @xmath28 is not smooth ) .",
    "therefore , the well developed theory of poisson and lie - poisson reduction is not directly applicable in this case , even though the loss of derivatives one suffers from these transformations is well understood .",
    "the main point of this paper is to resolve these difficulties in what we believe is a satisfactory way .",
    "we do this in the following sections .",
    "let @xmath77 be a weak riemannian manifold modelled on banach space @xmath78 with metric @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath80 possesses a canonical _ weak _ symplectic form that is given in charts by the following standard formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 .    for a smooth function @xmath84 on a ( strong ) symplectic manifold @xmath85 , let @xmath86 denote its hamiltonian vector field .",
    "then @xmath87 makes @xmath88 into a poisson manifold .",
    "since @xmath89 is weak , formula [ f : symppoisson ] does not automatically define poisson bracket @xmath90 for arbitrary functions @xmath91 since @xmath92 may fail to exist and even if they do , one has to make additional hypotheses to obtain the jacobi identity .    however , under the two additional hypothesis :    1 .",
    "@xmath77 has smooth riemannian connection ; 2 .   the inclusion @xmath93 ( the literal dual space ) via @xmath94 is dense ,    it will be shown that one can define a poisson bracket on the subalgebra @xmath95 of @xmath96 . here",
    "@xmath97 are covariant partial derivatives on @xmath80 , the definition of which will be given below .",
    "this newly defined bracket _ makes @xmath98 into a lie algebra and retains essential dynamical properties of a `` true '' poisson bracket , including the jacobi identity and the fact that flows of hamiltonian vector fields are poisson maps and , of course , energy is conserved .",
    "_ moreover , we will show that the bracket indeed is related to the canonical weak symplectic form in the way that one would expect . in the following",
