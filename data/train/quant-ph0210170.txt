    "the constant progress in the fabrication of nanostructures has led to novel semiconductor devices , like quantum wires and quantum dots , that allow the confinement and control of single electrons . in quantum dots",
    "it is possible to experimentally control the tunneling of single electrons and holes .",
    "these systems exhibit quantum - correlations in the emission statistics @xcite , and are very promising for future applications in quantum communication .    a quantum dot that emits single photons controlled by the switching of a voltage is called a single - photon turnstile @xcite . in such a system",
    ", the quantum dot is allowed to contain at most one single electron - hole pair , so that one photon is created at a time . in order to realize this ,",
    "one makes use of the coulomb blockade effect to suppress tunneling of a second electron or hole onto the dot .",
    "this implies that the system must be cooled to temperatures with @xmath0 smaller than the coulomb splittings . in a two - photon turnstile ,",
    "two electron - hole pairs are created , before two successive photons are emitted .",
    "recently , a two - photon turnstile has been proposed @xcite as a device to generate entangled photon pairs , which makes these systems very interesting . because the pauli principle allows occupation of an electronic level by at most two electrons , a two - photon turnstile can be realized without coulomb blockade effects , provided that the thermal energy is smaller than the splitting of the single - particle levels so that tunneling of more than two electron - hole pairs is avoided . in a small quantum dot",
    ", this splitting can be much larger then the coulomb splittings , so that a two photon turnstile does not require cooling in the millikelvin regime for proper operation .    in order to explore various possibilities for generation of entangled photons by two - photon turnstiles ,",
    "we consider in this paper simple level schemes that can occur when a quantum dot is smaller than the bulk exciton size , and study which situations are favorable for the generation of entangled photon pairs . in this regime ,",
    "the electron and hole wave functions are strongly localized so that the energy separation of individual levels is larger than the characteristic coulomb interaction energies .",
    "the central idea is that , due to resonant tunneling , only one twofold degenerate electron level and one twofold degenerate hole level of the quantum dot play an active role .",
    "other electron and hole levels are too remote in energy and may therefore be discarded in a first approximation . within the resulting finite scheme of dot states we study the entanglement of cascade photons from the biexciton decay , notably its dependence on the competition between charge carrier tunneling and radiative electron - hole recombination .",
    "the effect of a resonant cavity will also be calculated .",
    "a diagram of the semiconductor structure that we have in mind is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the quantum dot is located between p doped and n doped material . by means of a bias voltage @xmath1 over the junction and a gate voltage @xmath2 of an electrode near the dot , the electron level of the dot is made resonant with the bottom of the conduction band of the n type material and the hole level of the dot with the top of the valence band of the p type material .",
    "the quasi - particle energies @xmath3 and @xmath4 are well defined as the energy of the dot with one excess electron , respectively hole , with respect to the neutral state .",
    "the bias voltage @xmath1 separates the energy levels between the n and p sides by @xmath5 and the gate voltage shifts the electron and hole levels by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the resonance condition for a cental dot is then @xmath8 it is energetically favorable that electrons tunnel into the dot when @xmath9 and out of the dot when @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting level scheme is shown in figure [ fig2 ] and has only sixteen basis states , part of which are charged due to the presence of one or two excess electrons or holes . in this scheme ,",
    "the state with highest energy is the bi - exciton state , with two electrons in the upper level and two holes in the lower level .",
    "the optical properties are determined by exciton and biexciton states @xcite .",
    "it is in the cascade decay from the biexciton to the ground state via a state of the one - exciton multiplet that an entangled photon pair may be generated .",
    "the splitting of the one - exciton multiplet is an effect of the coulomb interaction between the particles @xcite , which will be discussed in the following .",
    "when one switches the gate voltage @xmath2 or the bias voltage @xmath1 , during a short time interval , first to a higher value and immediately thereafter to a lower value , then one promotes the tunneling of electrons from the n type material into the upper level of the dot , immediately followed by tunneling of holes from the p type material @xcite .",
    "the system state then follows the path indicated by the diagonal arrows in fig .",
    "the bi - exciton state is produced without intermediate formation of a one - exciton state .",
    "ideally the system will therefore emit a cascade of two photons , one on transition @xmath11 and one on transition @xmath12 , with frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to switch the gate voltage @xmath2 ( and bias voltage ) back to the resonant values ( [ 4 ] ) immediately after the preparation of the biexciton , in order to reduce the probability of electron or hole tunneling before the second photon is emitted .",
    "if tunneling nevertheless occurs before the second photon is emitted , then the transitions @xmath15 or @xmath16 between the charged states may occur .",
    "their frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 are in general different from @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as may be checked from eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) for the energy levels .",
    "therefore these photons may in principle be filtered out . in the next section",
    "we shall solve a master equation which includes the competition between tunneling and recombination processes .",
    "for small dots , states with more electrons or holes have non - resonant energies .",
    "provided the bias voltage is not too large , the biexciton state is the highest excited state and no multi - exciton states are formed @xcite .     axis .",
    "the quantum dot is a small cylindrical structure located in the i layer between n and p semiconductors . with the gate potential @xmath2",
    ", the electron and hole energies can be shifted .",
    "a bias voltage @xmath1 over the junction allows electrons ( black ) and holes ( white ) to tunnel across the barriers with rate @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the photon emission rate , as indicated.,width=226 ]      we consider the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes as a perturbation on interaction - free levels .",
    "this approximation is well known in the context of quantum dots without holes in the electronic distribution , which are in ( near ) equilibrium @xcite . for semiconductor quantum dots with holes , however , localized exciton states are formed from electron - hole pairs . only if the dot is smaller than the exciton size the single particle levels are well defined and the coulomb interaction can be treated as a perturbation @xcite .",
    "this is the condition that we suppose to be fulfilled in the following .",
    "since we consider systems in absence of magnetic fields , the single - electron levels are twofold degenerate due to time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "let the two degenerate single - particle states for the electron and hole level be described by @xmath21 in terms of the wave functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the spinor components .",
    "due to spin - orbit coupling these single particle states are not spin eigenstates in general .",
    "the dot states that form the basis of the configuration space are then described by the occupation of the four basis states ( [ 2 ] ) . the number of electrons within this space thus ranges from zero up to four .",
    "the ground state has the hole level occupied with electrons and therefore is an effective quasi - particle vacuum , denoted with @xmath24 .",
    "excited states of the dot are formed by means of creation of electrons in the higher level , and/or by creation of holes , i.e.  by removing electrons , from the lower level .",
    "this gives , in addition to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the further dot states @xmath29 where the labels @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath19 , and @xmath32 stand for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 . in first approximation",
    "the antisymmetrized matrix elements @xmath37 are those of the ( screened ) coulomb interaction , but a more detailed calculation should include many - body effects .",
    "however , whatever effects are included , in absence of external magnetic fields the time - reversal symmetry is always conserved .",
    "the one - exciton states are therefore either even ( @xmath38 ) or odd ( @xmath39 ) under time reversal and therefore given by @xmath40 for the same reason , the states with charge @xmath41 are all twofold degenerate .",

    "it should be mentioned that experimental information can be obtained by means of polarization measurements in combination with an external magnetic field @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) the sum of the photon energies of the transitions between the charged states is equal to the sum of the energies of the cascade photons in the decay of the ( neutral ) biexciton state : @xmath59 because holes are heavier than electrons , their wave function are more confined leading to a stronger repulsion between two holes than that between two electrons , @xmath60 . from this follow with eq .",

    "implies that two electrons or holes in the same level form a spin singlet state @xmath66 .",
