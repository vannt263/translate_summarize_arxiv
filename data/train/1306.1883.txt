    "aharonov and bohm in their celebrated paper have shown that the interference pattern of an electrically charged ensemble of particles traveling on a closed path in a region where the electromagnetic fields are absent can be affected by the electric and magnetic fields in the region from which they are excluded @xcite .",
    "this result is usually interpreted as a manifestation of non - locality of electromagnetism or as a direct physical effect attributed to the electromagnetic four - potential .",
    "looking for gravitational analogues , physical effects analogous to the electromagnetic aharonov - bohm have been considered by many authors through different approaches and perspectives @xcite . + basically two different versions of gravitational aharonov - bohm effect",
    "are discussed in the literature which could be attributed to the spacetime under consideration being static or stationary . in the first version arising in stationary spacetimes possessing gravitomagnetic field ,",
    "use is made of the fact that the gravitational field couples to all other fields . in this case taking advantage of analogy between ( weak ) gravitational fields and electromagnetism , it is shown , by solving the klein - gordon equation , that energy spectrum of a scalar particle in the region where the gravitomagnetic field vanishes depends on the gravitomagnetic flux in the region from which it is excluded @xcite .",
    "other studies following essentially the same approach but in different contexts could be found in @xcite",
    ". + also loop space variables in the gravitational field of a slowly rotating long cylindrical shell as well as a static cosmic string are being employed to investigate gravitational analogues of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "it is shown that when one parallel transports a vector around a rotating source it acquires a gravitationally induced phase shift which is proportional to the angular momentum of the source as a local quantity and this happens despite the fact that the riemann tensor dose not depend on the angular momentum .",
    "+ closely related to the above version of the effect , stachel considers globally stationary but locally static spacetimes and solves the eikonal equation in such backgrounds @xcite .",
    "he shows that the eikonal function is proportional to the period of a one - form which in the 1 + 3 ( or threading ) formulation of spacetime decomposition is called the _ threading vector_. it can be shown that the period is nothing but the gravitomagnetic flux defined in the same formulation of spacetime decomposition . the important point",
    "about stachel s approach is that the dependence of the phase shift on the rotation of the source is a classical result and could be obtained without an appeal to the weak field approximation .",
    "+ in the present paper we turn our attention to the second version of the effect investigated by ford and vilenkin @xcite . since the role of potentials and fields in the electromagnetism",
    "are played in general relativity by the metric and riemann curvature tensors respectively , one can study physical effects originated from the regions of non - zero curvature on particles moving in a region where curvature vanishes .",
    "in other words in this case there is no need for the notion of a gravitomagnetic field to produce the effect and it could even arise in a static spacetime . for this purpose",
    "they consider a tube - like distribution of matter producing a spacetime with two killing vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( which are timelike and spacelike respectively ) and asymptotically flat in the direction perpendicular to the tube .",
    "then they make use of a form of gauss - bonnet theorem stating that if a vector is parallel transported along a closed curve @xmath3 in a 2-surface @xmath4 it will not go back to itself but undergo a rotation by an angle @xmath5 given by the following area integral    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the gaussian curvature of the 2-surface and @xmath8 is the subsurface of @xmath4 enclosed by the curve . now assuming that the curve @xmath3 lies in the asymptotically flat region then the particle moving on this curvature - less region still feels the effect from non - zero - curvature region , hence a version of gravitational aharonov - bohm effect . to give an explicit example",
    ", they have applied their formulation to the case of a tube - like dust source using weak field approximation to calculate the gaussian curvature in terms of the components of the energy - momentum tensor of the source .",
    "+ in this article we employ the same approach but in the context of the 1 + 3-decomposition of spacetimes which leads to the quasi - maxwell form of the einstein field equations and the so called _",
    "gravitoelectromagnetism_. this decomposition introduces a differentiable 3-manifold with a metric element prescribing spatial distances in a given stationary spacetime .",
    "this in turn allows one to express the gaussian curvature of a 2-surface in terms of the components of the energy - momentum tensor of the source and the _ gravitoelectric _ field of the underlying spacetime without using the weak field approximation .",
    "outline of the paper is as follows : first we introduce briefly the 1 + 3 decomposition of a stationary spacetime in section ii and then , using the projection tensor defined on that basis , in section iii we calculate an expression for the gaussian curvature in terms of the 3-dimensional ricci scalar and ricci tensor . in section",
    "iv we apply this expression to different solutions including static dust solutions and spacetime of a cosmic string . in the last section",
    "the results are summarized .",
    "considering the light propagation in a stationary spacetime between two nearby spatial points @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the spacetime metric could be written in the following general form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the spatial metric . in this so - called @xmath0 formulation of spacetime decomposition",
    "@xmath15 is the infinitesimal interval of _ synchronized proper time _ and @xmath16 is the infinitesimal spatial distance between the two events",
    ". the spacetime being stationary ( @xmath17 ) will allow one to define distance along a curve in a finite region of the spacetime by the integral @xmath18 . in a more rigorous mathematical language ,",
    "a stationary spacetime @xmath19 is decomposed into spatial and temporal sections by a congruence of timelike curves generated by the timelike killing vector field @xmath20 of the spacetime .",

    "another feature in the above equations , which will be employed later , is the simple fact that by equation ( [ r01 ] ) a non - vacuum , static ( @xmath42 ) solution produced by a perfect fluid , in general has to be in the comoving frame ( @xmath43 ) with respect to the dust particles .",

    "+ to follow ford and vilenkin we consider a stationary space - time corresponding to a tube - like distribution of matter with two killing vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are timelike and spacelike respectively . let @xmath4 be a 2-surface in @xmath44 orthogonal to the two killing vectors and @xmath3 a closed curve in the 2-surface which may or may not encircle the tube containing the source . now according to the relation",
    "if a vector is parallel transported around @xmath3 it will acquire a rotation angle @xmath5 due to the non - zero curvature region in the 2-surface @xmath4 . to relate the gaussian curvature of the 2-surface to the gravitoelectromagnetic fields of the underlying spacetime we introduce , using the spacelike killing vector @xmath45 , a projection tensor from @xmath30 to @xmath4 as follows @xmath46 where now @xmath47 is the unit vector normal to @xmath4 .",

    "+ since @xmath56 is a killing vector of the @xmath30 space and orthogonal to the 2-surface @xmath4 one can show that the extrinsic curvature of the 2-surface is zero and hence by gauss - codazzi equation we have @xmath57 .",
    "this could be used in turn to calculate the two - dimensional ricci tensor as follows @xmath58 where in the last equality by replacing for the projection tensor ( [ proj2 ] ) we end up with @xmath59 therefore the two - dimensional ricci scalar of the 2-surface @xmath4 with coordinates @xmath60 and metric @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where use is made of the fact that @xmath63 . now applying the relation @xmath64 to the above equation we obtain the following relation for the gaussian curvature of the 2-surface in terms of the 3-dimensional ricci scalar and ricci tensor of the 3-space @xmath30 @xmath65 up to now we have considered stationary tube - like spacetimes which possess two killing vectors but it is obvious that the above formulation could also be applied to cylindrically symmetric spacetimes which have an extra killing vector @xmath66 . in the next two subsections",
    "first we apply the above relation to a static dust solution and then to cylindrically symmetric spacetimes to study a gravitational analogue of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "as it is clear from its derivation , relation can be applied to any tube - like _ stationary spacetime _ with a given energy - momentum tensor , but to compare our results with those of ford and vilenkin @xcite first we apply it to a static tube - like distribution of dust given by the following general metric @xmath67 where all the metric components are functions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for such a spacetime from contraction of equation ( with @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 )",
    "we arrive at @xmath73 where we have used in the last step . for the second term in the right hand side of we obtain @xmath74 after substituting equations and in , the gaussian curvature for static dust yields @xmath75 the first term in is the exact same term that was obtained by ford and vilenkin @xcite for a tube - like distribution of dust in the weak field regime , but the second term which depends on the gravitoelectric field of the source and generally non - zero is absent in their approach . now taking the spacetime to be asymptotically flat ( where @xmath76 as @xmath77 ) , by equation , a particle parallel transported along a closed path @xmath3 in this zero - curvature region will nevertheless be affected by the non - zero curvature in the interior region .",
    "+ since the second term is proportional to the gravitoelectric field , when integrated over a closed path , it reminds one of the colella - overhauser - werner ( cow ) experiment / effect @xcite .",
    "this term arising from a purely geometrical consideration , shows that the gravitationally induced phase shift has a classical origin .",
    "the presence of this term shows that even when the closed path of a particle does not encircle the source , there still will be an effect in the interference pattern resulting from the presence of the gravitoelectric field . to investigate in more detail the effect of this extra term , in the next subsection we consider cylindrically symmetric dust spacetimes / sources and their matching to exterior ( vacuum ) solutions .",
    "consider matching of a cylindrically symmetric static dust solution , at a given radius @xmath78 , to an exterior ( vacuum ) asymptotically flat static solution , both of the general type but now all metric components are functions only of @xmath68 . as an explicit example one can think of the interior solution introduced by teixeira and som @xcite , representing counter rotating dust particles with net zero angular momentum and the following energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the four velocities of the counter rotating particles with @xmath82 .",
    "this interior spacetime is matched to the well - known exterior levi - civita metric @xcite @xmath83,\\label{lc}\\ ] ] in which @xmath84 and @xmath3 are scaling parameters and @xmath85 , for small values , could be interpreted as the effective gravitational mass per unit proper length . to be related to the parameters of the static dust solution .",

    "equation is an interesting result showing that not only the density of the particles but also norm of their velocity , both as local quantities , have global effects .",
    "the presence of @xmath88 is a manifestation of the fact that the kinetic energy of the particles gravitates even though their net angular momentum is zero .",
    "+ obviously for the exterior ( vacuum ) static solution ( @xmath93 ) we end up with the following relation for the gaussian curvature @xmath94 the overall result in the arrangement of fig.1 , as in the case of a simple static dust solution , for a path @xmath3 in the asymptotically ( locally ) flat region , is a rotation angle which is a manifestation of a gravitational aharonov - bohm effect . +",
    "ii - in this case the closed path of the parallel transported particle @xmath95 does not encircle the non - vacuum cylindrical region ( fig.2 ) so that the rotation angle is given by @xmath96 which is obviously of the cow - type effect leading to gravitationally induced phase shift on the transported particle . in other words the gaussian curvature having a non - zero contribution from the second term in ( [ kd ] ) represents the cow - type effect for a cylindrical gravitational field represented by the above exterior metric . indeed in this approach , both gravitational aharonov - bohm effect and the cow effect / experiment , for cylindrically symmetric spacetimes , were treated as different phase shifts under the same formulation .      as another somewhat trivial example of the application of the formalism introduced in section iii , we turn our attention to the space - time of a cosmic string that seems to be naturally adapted to the investigations on gravitational aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "space - time metric of a cosmic string is given by setting @xmath97 in ( with the rescaling parameter @xmath84 removed ) @xcite @xmath98 the corresponding energy - momentum tensor is given by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the linear mass density and @xmath101 is the determinant of the metric on the @xmath102 and @xmath103 2-surface @xmath8 .",
    "to compute the gaussian curvature we rewrite the last of quasi - maxwell equations , equation , for the above spacetime metric and energy - momentum tensor as follows ( with @xmath104 ) @xmath105 contraction with @xmath106 gives the 3-dimensional ricci scalar as follows @xmath107 on the other hand it is an easy task to see that in the adapted coordinate system ( in which @xmath108 ) the second term in the right hand side of relation vanishes so that the gaussian curvature in this case is given by @xmath109 after performing the area integral of @xmath7 over two - surface @xmath8 we have the rotation angle @xmath110 . now employing the the gauss - bonnet theorem @xmath111 to the above case we can find the deficit angle @xmath112 corresponding to a cosmic string . to do",
    "so we take @xmath113 and @xmath114 for euler characteristic and geodesic curvature of the corresponding 2-surface @xmath8 and its encircling path @xmath115 respectively i.e , @xmath116 leading to the scaling factor @xmath117 of a cosmic string in terms of its linear mass density .",
    "with the help of a projection tensor defined in the context of @xmath0 formulation of spacetime decomposition we introduced an expression for the gaussian curvature of a 2-surface in terms of the ricci scalar and ricci tensor of the corresponding 3-space @xmath30 . on the other hand using the quasi - maxwell form of the einstein field equations we have related the components of the energy - momentum tensor of a source and the grvitoelectromagnetic fields of the underlying spacetime to the 3-dimensional ricci tensor of @xmath30 .",
    "this enabled us to relate the gaussian curvature of a 2-surfaces in @xmath30 to local quantities such as the energy density of the source and velocity norm of its constituent particles .",
    "the expression is then applied to the case of a tube - like perfect fluid source to investigate a version of gravitational aharonov - bohm effect introduced by ford and vilenkin .",
    "while they have applied their formalism to a static dust solution in the weak field regime here we have shown that our formulation allows one to apply it to _ stationary spacetimes _ and without appeal to the weak field regime . in doing so",

    "it is shown that this phase shift could be interpreted as the _ classical _ version of the well known cow ( experiment ) effect .",
    "this was shown explicitly in the context of a static cylindrically symmetric vacuum solution matched to an interior static dust solution . indeed applying our formulation to the case of a dust solution produced by counter - rotating particles",
    "we have arrived at a gaussian curvature which is related not only to the energy density of the source but also to the norm of the particle velocities , despite the fact that their net angular momentum is zero . as another trivial example of the application of our formalism , also showing its consistency , deficit angle of a cosmic string",
