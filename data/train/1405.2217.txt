    "one of the remarkable phenomena in condensed matter physics is the universality of properties related to phonon attenuation at temperatures smaller than @xmath2 k in a large class of materials , ranging from amorphous solids , to disordered lattices , disordered polymers , and quasi - crystals@xcite . the fact that universality is also quantitative , both in the magnitude of phonon attenuation , and in the energy scale dictating the temperature below which the phenomenon is observed , and the broadness of systems exhibiting it , attests to the presence of a mechanism , pertaining to the disordered state itself , that dictates phonon attenuation in disordered systems .",
    "exceptions to universality are rare , and have been observed only in two - dimensional films under special conditions ; hydrogenated silicon films@xcite and silicon nitride films under applied stress@xcite .",
    "theoretically , much of the characteristics of disordered solids can be understood within the  standard tunneling model \" ( stm)@xcite , which introduces tunneling two - level systems ( tlss ) ; their interaction with the phonon field dominating phonon attenuation . within the stm all phonon attenuation properties",
    "are given in terms of the  tunneling strength \" @xmath3 , where n is the density of states ( dos ) of the tlss , @xmath4 is their interaction constant with the phonon field ( strain ) , @xmath5 is the mass density , and @xmath6 the acoustic velocity .",
    "however , the stm can not explain what is the nature of the tlss , why is phonon attenuation universal among different systems , and the origin of the energy scale of @xmath2 k dictating the universality regime .    attempts to understand the nature of the tlss include  top - down \" approaches , trying to construct a theory which relies only on the glassy state of matter@xcite , and  bottom - up \" approaches , attempting to identify the relevant tlss in a given system , and then generalize to all disordered systems showing universality@xcite .",
    "specifically , the kbr : cn system was scrutinized , and it was suggested early on@xcite that it is the flipping of the cn@xmath7 impurities ( and not e.g. their rotations ) that make for the relevant tlss dictating the universal properties in this system .",
    "to test this idea an experiment was carried on the ar : n@xmath0 glass , which does not possess single impurities that can flip , with and without the addition of co impurities@xcite .",
    "the fact that the linear term in the specific heat , corresponding to the dos of the tlss , had little if any dependence on the co concentration , was interpreted as a refutation of the molecular flips as being the relevant tlss dictating universality .",
    "little attention was paid to the fact that ar : n@xmath0 did not exhibit universal phonon attenuation as observed in its thermal conductivity@xcite .",
    "recently , the fact that cn@xmath7 flips in kbr : cn indeed constitute the tlss dictating universal phonon attenuation and the linear specific heat in kbr : cn at @xmath8 k received overwhelming support . using density functional theory and ab - initio calculations it was shown that the coupling of cn@xmath7 flips to the strain @xmath9 ev , whereas the coupling of cn@xmath7 rotations to the strain @xmath10 ev@xcite , the former value agreeing with the experimental value obtained for the relevant tlss at low temperatures@xcite",
    ". furthermore , the dos of cn@xmath7 flips and cn@xmath7 rotations was calculated numerically from first principles@xcite , where it was shown that cn@xmath7 flips are abundant at energies @xmath11 k , whereas cn@xmath7 rotations are scarce below @xmath12 k , as they are gapped by the weakly interacting flips .",
    "all these findings are in excellent agreement with the recently introduced two - tls model@xcite , which derives the universality of phonon attenuation and the energy scale of @xmath2 k for the universal regime as a consequence of the existence of two classes of tlss differentiated by their interaction with the strain , based on the symmetry of the tlss under inversion .",
    "yet , the above mentioned results in kbr : cn and the two - tls model seems to be at odds with the experimental results in ar : n@xmath0:co , as the latter suggest that the co flips have no significant contribution to the low energy properties of ar : n@xmath0:co .    in this paper",
    "we reconcile this alleged discrepancy . using a discrete atomic model employing the lennard jones ( lj ) potential , as well as density function theory ( dft )",
    ", we calculate the tls - strain interaction constant for various tlss in both ar : n@xmath0 and ar : n@xmath0:co systems . for the latter",
    "we find that indeed co flips have a much weaker interaction with the phonon field compared to all other excitations studied , in agreement with the two - tls model , and similar to cn@xmath7 flips in kbr : cn .",
    "however , because of the untypical softness of the ar : n@xmath0:co lattice , and the resulting smallness of tls - phonon interactions ( both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are smaller than @xmath15 and @xmath16 , by a factor of @xmath2 and by an order of magnitude , respectively ) , we expect universality in ar : n@xmath0:co to appear only below @xmath17 k. for ar : n@xmath0 , where single impurity flips are absent , we find a related absence of a distinct class of tlss weakly interacting with the strain .",
    "we then study the dos of tls bias energies for the different tls configurations , and find again no distinct class of tlss typified by low bias energies . since ar",
    ": n@xmath0 does not fulfill the necessary conditions for universality as are suggested by the two - tls model@xcite , and in view of its low temperature thermal conductivity as was obtained experimentally , we argue that ar : n@xmath0 constitutes a first example of a non - universal strongly disordered glass in three dimensions and in ambient pressure .",
    "for most of our calculations , we have employed a model developed expressly for this purpose .",
    "it is based on the iterative solution , using previously described numerical methods@xcite , of a mesh of non - linear springs with lennard - jones @xmath18 potential@xcite to describe all the interactions . in particular , we assumed the following lennard - jones parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20,@xcite @xmath21 , @xmath22,@xcite @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xcite , @xmath25 , @xmath26,@xcite , taking measures to deal with the numerical instabilities that arise from the double n - n potential ( intramolecular and intermolecular ) .",
    "starting from a pristine ar lattice ( a pure ar network with crystallographic positions@xcite ) , we very gradually raise the concentration of @xmath27 , adding them one by one .",
    "we do this up to a limit of 20%ar:80%n@xmath0 . as the ar:@xmath27 ratio is decreased and",
    "to minimize artificial structural stress , we adjust the lattice intersite distance to match the real density of ar : n@xmath0 mixtures .    in the n@xmath0 enrichment process of the ar lattice the goal is to minimize the energy and at the same time to obtain a variety of structures so that the end result is statistically representative .",
    "to achieve this , each new n@xmath0 impurity added takes a random position and orientation , but every time that we are about to add a new impurity , we choose up to 50 random positions and orientations for it , starting from the same equilibrium lattice .",
    "for each of these 50 possibilities , the structure of the lattice is relaxed , allowing the positions of all atoms and the orientations of all molecules to adjust slightly .",
    "note that in the very first step , when the previous position was the pristine ar lattice , this generates 50 second - step structures , branching out the procedure .",
    "subsequent steps do not continue with the branching and instead optimize the energy : for each one of the 50 structures with @xmath28 impurities we obtain 50 with @xmath29 , but keep only the most stable one .",
    "we end up with 50 different low - energy configurations for each ar : n@xmath0 ratio . for each of these",
    ", a monte - carlo procedure is used allowing for random orientation tunneling of each n@xmath0 molecule ( 25 sweeps ) for further lowering the energy . after each monte - carlo step the structure is relaxed . at the end of the monte - carlo procedure ,",
    "the system is ready to suffer the different kinds of excitations as described below .",
    "the efficiency of this model allows the use of rather large fragments , a continuous exploration of the range of ar : n@xmath0 ratios and the obtention of statistically significant number of low - energy configurations and all their relevant excitations .",
    "we performed calculations both for 2d and 3d ( hcp and fcc ) structures , but focused mainly on 2d , where reaching good low energy states is easier because of the smaller number of stable n@xmath0 orientations ( @xmath30 in 2d vs. @xmath31 in 3d ) , and at the same time the constraints for finding centrosymmetric tlss are less stringent than in 3d , see below .",
    "more details about the model can be found in a dedicated article .",

    "kbr : cn is one of many disordered lattices showing low temperature phonon attenuation properties which are equivalent in both functional form and magnitude to those observed in all amorphous solids , and are thus dubbed universal . for kbr",
    ": cn it was shown that universality is intimately related to the existence of bi - modality in the typical values of the tls - strain coupling ; inversion symmetric ( flips ,  @xmath32 \" ) tlss having a typically weak interaction with the strain and inversion asymmetric ( rotations ,  s \" ) tlss having a typically strong interaction with the strain .",
    "the ratio between the two interaction constants , @xmath33 , dictates the ratio between the typical bias energies of @xmath32-tlss and s - tlss , and consequently the universality and smallness of the tunneling strength .",
    "the energy scale related to the temperature below which universality is observed is given by the typical bias energy of the @xmath32-tlss : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the typical distance between impurities .",
    "this energy , being @xmath36 times smaller than the glass temperature , is typically a few kelvin .",
    "as we found for the kbr : cn system@xcite , we find here also for the ar : n@xmath0:co system a bi - modality in the values of the interaction constants of tlss with the strain , where co flips constitute a distinct group of weakly interacting tlss , _ i.e. _ @xmath37 has a typical value much smaller than all other calculated tls - phonon coupling constants , including that of co rotation .",
    "thus , we expect the dos of tlss in ar : n@xmath0:co to show a similar structure to that found in kbr : cn@xcite , where the @xmath32-tlss dominate the spectrum at low energies , have a roughly constant dos , and thus dominate phonon attenuation . furthermore , this structure of dos coupled with the above mentioned bi - modality in the typical strengths of the tlss interaction with the strain necessarily leads to qualitative and quantitative universality in phonon attenuation .",
    "we thus expect ar : n@xmath0:co to show all the universal properties known in glasses .",
    "however , since both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are untypically small for co excitations in ar : n@xmath0:co , we expect universality in this system to be present only at temperatures smaller than @xmath1 k.    the situation in ar : n@xmath0 , in the absence of co impurities , is very different , since no single impurity flips exist .",
    "furthermore , we have shown here that no other excitation can play the role of such flips in having a small typical interaction with the strain and small typical bias energies in comparison to all other excitations in this system ; we find no off - center displacements of ar atoms or n@xmath0 molecules ; we then show explicitly that n@xmath0 rotations and pair excitations have strain interactions of typical value @xmath39 and typical bias energies @xmath40 .",
    "this is true also for pair excitations possessing local inversion symmetry , because the proximity of each of the pair molecules ( or ar atom ) to other n@xmath0 molecules in the solid yields large typical values for tls - strain interactions and tls bias energies .",
    "although we have not checked all types of excitations , including those involving larger number of impurities , we can not foresee a scenario in which any such type of excitation would give rise to a systematically weak interaction with the strain .",
    "indeed , although excess low temperature specific heat is found in ar : n@xmath0 , resulting from an abundance of low energy excitations , its thermal conductivity was found to have a very different temperature dependence than that typical for glasses at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "we therefore argue that ar : n@xmath0 is a non - universal glass , the first among strongly disordered systems having tunneling states , whereas the apparent similarity between the values of the specific heat in ar : n@xmath0 and ar : n@xmath0:co@xcite is limited to the relatively high temperature , in comparison to the energy scale of the bias energies of co flips , studied experimentally .",
    "our results here are tightly connected to the discussion regarding the necessary and sufficient conditions to observe universality in disordered lattices .",
    "in addition to strong strain disorder and tunneling tlss@xcite , the existence of a distinct class of tlss weakly interacting with the strain is required .",
    "this is in line with the two - tls model , showing that such a class of low energy excitations is an outcome of the existence of inversion symmetric tlss .",
    "indeed , we find that ar : n@xmath0 , which does not show universal properties at low temperatures , does not possess local inversion symmetric flip excitations , and does not have a distinct class of weakly interacting tlss . at the same time , we refute the notion that co flips in ar : n@xmath0:co do not contribute to the low energy properties of this system . in",
    "that we refute the central criticism to the sufficiency of the above conditions , including the presence of inversion symmetric ( flip ) excitations , for the appearance of universality at low temperatures .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest that the rather universal temperature of @xmath2 k below which universality is observed is related also to the fact that typical interactions between near neighbor impurities are rather similar in different solids , ar : n@xmath0:co being a marked exception .",
    "our conclusions here are based on the two - tls model , and its proven applicability to disordered lattices showing universality .",
    "were these conclusion to apply also to amorphous solids , it would suggest the generic existence in amorphous solids of local excitations with markedly weak interaction with the phonon field and small bias energies .",
    "it would therefore be of much interest to check the applicability of the two - tls model to amorphous solids .",
