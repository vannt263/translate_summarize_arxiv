    "a considerable number of studies have been conducted on the phase structure of the elastic membrane model of polyakov - kleinert and helfrich @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model includes not only the gaussian term but also a bending energy term , which can make the surface smooth .",
    "thus it has been recognized that there are a smooth phase and a crumpled phase in the model of spherical topology .",
    "numerical studies have also been made to understand the phase transitions in the tethered model and in the fluid model on triangulated surfaces @xcite , where the tethered and the fluid models are those defined on fixed connectivity surfaces and on dynamically triangulated surfaces , respectively . except those smooth surfaces and crumpled surfaces , some linear structure @xcite and branched polymer surfaces @xcite have also been recognized in the context of surface models .",
    "on the other hand , little is known about a model of tubular surfaces .",
    "a tubular surface is considered as one of the basic forms of real physical membranes @xcite .",
    "reviewing references on tubular surfaces , we must recall anisotropic surface models that have been constructed to understand tubular surfaces @xcite .",
    "a tubular phase is realized in the anisotropic model due to an anisotropic bending modulus .",
    "however , there has been no study that tried to understand tubular surfaces from an isotropic surface model",
    ". therefore it will be interestng to study an isotropic tethered surface model corresponding to the nambu - goto string @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to understand the phase structure of the tethered surface model of nambu and goto with a deficit angle term , which is obtained from the co - ordination dependent term .",
    "no bending energy term is included in the hamiltonian , whereas the deficit angle term serves as a curvature energy smoothing the surface .",
    "we will show numerically that the model has three distinct phases ; crumpled , tubular , and smooth . the crumpled and the tubular phases are connected by a higher - order transition , whereas the tubular and the smooth phases are connected by a first - order transition .",
    "we consider that oblong tubular surfaces can be seen in the nambu - goto model .",
    "a discretized hamiltonian of the nambu - goto string is given by the sum of the area of triangles , which corresponds to the gaussian term of the polyakov - kleinert model .",
    "the area term of the nambu - goto model imposes a constraint only on the area of triangles , and hence all the triangles become oblong and form spiky configurations . in fact , it is well known that the partition function of the nambu - goto model is not well defined @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that the partition function of the nambu - goto model changes to a well - defined one if some additional term is included in the partition function , as was suggested already in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , it is expected that such oblong triangles may form tubular surfaces in such a well - defined model if the additional term tends to modify the spherical surface to a tubular one .",
