    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) are layered materials with the chemical composition mx@xmath1 , where m  is a transition metal element ( such as molybdenum or tungsten ) , and x  is a chalcogen ( sulfur , selenium , or tellurium ) .",
    "the interest to semiconducting tmdcs has been sparked by the recent discovery of the monolayer mos@xmath1 being a direct - gap semiconductor , in contrast to its bulk indirect - gap counterpart @xcite .",
    "atomically thin tmdc monolayers can be extracted from bulk crystals by exfoliation , similarly to graphene @xcite , or grown by molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition @xcite .",
    "the optical gap in the visible light range @xcite and tightly bound excitons @xcite , make them quite promising for optical applications @xcite .",
    "a unique feature of tmdcs is the so - called spin - valley locking @xcite .",
    "the conduction and valence band extrema are located at the two inequivalent @xmath2 points ( valleys ) of the hexagonal first brillouin zone .",
    "absence of inversion symmetry and strong spin - orbit interaction , originating from @xmath3-orbitals of the metal atoms , leads to spin splitting of the bands .",
    "the sign of the splitting is opposite in the two valleys , as required by the time - reversal symmetry , so the lowest - energy electron and hole states have opposite spin projections in the opposite valleys , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmdcbands ] .",
    "it is important that the two valleys can be addressed separately by optical means .",
    "namely , in each valley optical transitions with only one of the two in - plane circular polarizations are allowed  @xcite",

    "the dashed arrows represent circularly polarized optical transitions for @xmath4 excitons in each valley .",
    ", width=302 ]    the large spin splitting in the valence band ( a fraction of ev ) gives rise to two prominent features in the absorption spectrum , called @xmath4 and @xmath5 excitons , formed by a hole in the upper or lower spin - split valence band , respectively , and an electron in the conduction band .",
    "the spin splitting in the conduction band is much weaker ( on the mev scale ) ; moreover , its sign depends on the material : in molybdenum - based compounds , the top valence band and the lowest conduction band have the same spin projection in the same valley , while in tungsten - based ones , they are opposite ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tmdcbands ] ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that the lowest - energy @xmath4 excitons in wx@xmath1 involve electronic states either from the same valley but with opposite spins , or with the same spin but from different valleys . as the photons , polarized in the plane ,",
    "couple only to the orbital degrees of freedom and carry a very small momentum , they are decoupled from such excitons , which therefore have been named `` dark '' .",
    "this picture provided a natural explanation of the experimentally observed rise of the luminescence intensity in wse@xmath1 with increasing temperature in terms of the increasing thermal population of the higher - energy bright @xmath4  excitons @xcite . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "several peaks at energies below the neutral and charged bright @xmath4 excitons have been seen in the wse@xmath1 luminescence spectrum @xcite .",
    "these observations pose an important question about existence of possible mechanisms for radiative decay of the dark excitons . while the radiative decay of bright excitons in tmdcs fits in the standard picture for 2d excitons @xcite and",
    "has been described in several theoretical works @xcite , the dark exciton radiative decay requires unlocking the spin and the valley degrees of freedom .",
    "namely , for intervalley dark excitons , a large momentum should be provided to the electron or to the hole without flipping its spin , which requires a third body ( a phonon , an impurity , another electron or a hole ) . for intravalley dark exciton decay ,",
    "a spin flip is required .",
    "investigation of this latter possibility is the subject of the present work .    in this paper , we give an estimate of the intravalley dark exciton radiative decay rate due to several spin - flip mechanisms .",
    "one such mechanism could be the bychkov - rashba effect  @xcite , as mentioned in ref .",
    "it requires breaking of the crystal symmetry with respect to reflection in the monolayer plane .",
    "this can be achieved by applying an external electric field , perpendicular to the plane ; the corresponding rashba coefficient has been calculated in ref .",
    "the reflection symmetry can also be broken if the dielectric environments on the two sides of the monolayer are different .",
    "having not found any information on the magnitude of this effect in the literature , we make our own crude estimate ; for a tmdc monolayer on a glass - like substrate with the empty space above , we obtain an equivalent electric field to be roughly of the order of 0.1  v /  .",
    "however , even for this relatively high field , the resulting radiative rate is about @xmath6 of the bright exciton decay rate  @xmath7 , which makes the rashba mechanism totally negligible with respect to other relaxation processes .",
    "the main reason for such smallness is that rashba spin - flip amplitude is proportional to the electron momentum , and radiative decay is possible only in a narrow radiative region of small momenta .",
    "another way to flip the electron spin is to apply an in - plane magnetic field and use the zeeman effect .",
    "it is momentum - independent , and for a quite high but still realistic field of 30  t we obtain a radiative rate exceeding @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we analyzed the intrinsic radiative decay mechanism due to the interband spin - flip dipole moment perpendicular to the monolayer plane , mentioned in refs .",
    "in fact , it is the presence of this dipole moment that gives rise to bychkov - rashba coupling in a perpendicular electric field  @xcite , so its magnitude can be deduced from the estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite for the rashba coefficient .",
    "this enabled us to estimate the associated radiative decay rate as @xmath9 .",
    "however , we also found that the same out - of - plane interband dipole gives rise to a coulomb local - field term which lifts the double degeneracy between the dark excitons made of electronic states from the two valleys .",
    "this local - field effect is analogous to the exchange energy shift of the @xmath10  excitons in semiconductor quantum wells  @xcite , and produces an energy splitting which we very roughly estimate as about 10  mev .",
    "its precise evaluation requires a microscopic treatment on the atomic scales , similar to that in ref .",
    "crucially , the whole oscillator strength of the interband spin - flip dipole goes into the higher - energy component .",
    "thus , we find that the dark intravalley @xmath4  exciton has , in fact , two components , one really dark and the other one about 1001000 times darker than the bright exciton , so it can be called `` dim '' . because of the splitting , at low temperatures the emission from the dim exciton should be suppressed by an activation factor , analogously to that from the bright one .",
    "note that the dark component can be made decay by applying an in - plane magnetic field , as mentioned above , and the corresponding rate can be made comparable to that of the dim component for a sufficiently high field .",
