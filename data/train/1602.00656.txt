    "bulk iron selenide ( fese ) is an unconventional superconductor with a relatively modest transition temperature @xmath4 k at ambient pressures @xcite ; however , its @xmath5 can be increased by upwards of a factor of ten when a monolayer of fese is deposited on srtio@xmath6 ( sto ) @xcite or batio@xmath6 ( bto ) substrates @xcite .",
    "this discovery has attracted considerable scientific interest @xcite as it provides not only a new route to high - temperature ( high-@xmath5 ) superconductivity but also a new lens through which unconventional superconductivity can be studied .",
    "several proposals have been advanced for the microscopic origin of this enhancement and the most widely discussed scenarios are broadly divided into two categories .",
    "the first category involves charge transfer between the substrate and the film , which dopes the monolayer with excess electrons .",
    "this may result in modifications of the electronic structure , which in turn enhances an unconventional pairing mechanism @xcite or suppresses competing phases @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the charge transfer shifts the holelike bands centered at @xmath7 below the fermi level @xcite , creating an electronic structure similar to the intercalated fese systems @xcite .",
    "this electronic structure challenges the fermi - surface - nesting driven , purely electronic pairing mechanism common to the iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "the second category of proposals for fese / sto encompasses interface - related effects , where a more direct role is played by the substrate .",
    "the main proposals here include the suppression of a competing phase via strain or modifications of the electron - phonon ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) interaction in the fese layer @xcite , or the introduction of one across the interface @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the last scenario , which is motivated by several key experimental observations .",
    "the first is that the intercalated fese systems @xcite and fese / sto thin films post - treated with k  @xcite or na  @xcite adatoms all have maximum @xmath5 values @xmath8",
    "k. this is despite the fact that all of these systems have a similar electronic structure to fese monolayers on sto .",
    "this indicates that any common unconventional pairing mechanism in these systems is insufficient to account for the observed high-@xmath9  k in monolayer fese / sto and fese / bto and an additional contribution to pairing is likely needed @xcite . the second ( and more important )",
    "observation is that of replica bands in the electronic structure of superconducting fese / sto @xcite .",
    "these are interpreted as shake - off states arise from a coupling between the fese 3@xmath10 electrons and an optical o bond stretching phonon branch in the oxide substrate .",
    "the crucial observation here is the size and shape of these replica bands  being complete copies of the main electron band shows that the @xmath1-@xmath2  coupling constant must be strongly peaked in the forward scattering direction ( small @xmath11 ) .",
    "because of this momentum structure , the cross - interface coupling is strongly intraband in nature and can contribute to pairing in most channels , even those commonly associated with repulsive pairing mechanisms relevant for the iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "these observations make the cross - interface coupling a likely candidate for the additional pairing needed to produce the observed @xmath5 in fese / sto @xcite .",
    "as this is a special issue on _ superconductivity in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) limit _ it is worth stressing that the forward focus of the cross - interface @xmath1-@xmath2  interaction can be understood as a consequence of dimensionality of the fese thin films and the anisotropic dielectric properties of the interface .",
    "a more complete discussion of this aspect can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we summarize the main points .",
    "the fese films sit a distance @xmath12 above the tio terminated sto substrate @xcite .",
    "the motion of the oxygen atoms in the direction perpendicular to the fese film induce a local dipole moment with an effective charge @xmath13 at the surface of the substrate . as a result",
    ", the optical o modes create an electric dipole potential on the fese electrons . in the continuum limit",
    ", this perturbation will dynamically scatter the fese electrons from states with in - plane momentum @xmath14 to @xmath15 with a matrix element @xmath16 here , @xmath11 is the in - plane momentum transfer , @xmath17 sets the range of the interaction in momentum space , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the dielectric constant parallel ( perpendicular ) to the interface . in fese / sto ( and also fese / bto )",
    "one expects @xmath20 @xcite , since the fese film can provide additional metallic screening parallel to the interface . in this limit",
    ", @xmath21 is small , resulting in an interaction that is peaked at @xmath22 .",
    "previously , some of the present authors showed that a strong forward - focused interaction not only reproduces the replica band structure but also acts as a remarkably effective pairing mediator with a superconducting @xmath23 in the weak coupling limit @xcite .",
    "as such , the cross - interface @xmath1-@xmath2  coupling implied by the replica bands can provide a substantial contribution to @xmath5 and this can work in conjunction with an unconventional pairing mechanism .",
    "this outlook is supported by recent projector quantum monte carlo results @xcite and multiband bcs results involving the incipient hole bands at the @xmath24-point @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to understand and confirm the exact role played by the cross - interface coupling .",
    "motivated by this , we build upon our previous work @xcite and present several aspects of a 2d system of electrons coupled to an optical phonon branch by forward focused interaction . our aim is to draw a more complete picture of the consequences of such interaction and to provide further spectroscopic signatures that can be used to confirm its presence .",
    "we note that while our focus is on the fese / sto system , similar forward scattering may occur in other low - dimensional correlated systems @xcite .",

    "<S> mono- and multilayer fese thin films grown on srtio@xmath0 and bitio@xmath0 substrates exhibit a greatly enhanced superconductivity over that found in bulk fese . </S>",
    "<S> a number of proposals have been advanced for the mechanism of this enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is the introduction of a cross - interface electron - phonon ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) interaction between the fese electrons and oxygen phonons in the substrates that is peaked in the forward scattering ( small @xmath3 direction due to the two - dimensional nature of the interface system . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this , we explore the consequences of such an interaction on the superconducting state and electronic structure of a two - dimensional system using migdal - eliashberg theory . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction produces not only deviations from the expectations of conventional phonon - mediated pairing but also replica structures in the spectral function and density of states , as probed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy , and quasi - particle interference imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the applicability of migdal - eliashberg theory for a situation where the @xmath1-@xmath2  interaction is peaked at small momentum transfer and in the fese / sto system .    </S>",
    "<S> = 4    _ keywords _ : superconductivity , forward scattering , eliashberg theory , fese films </S>"
