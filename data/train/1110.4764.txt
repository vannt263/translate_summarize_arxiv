    "in the frame of the restricted three - body problem , the roche geometry is a fundamental notion , and it is much studied , using for this aim different coordinate systems .",
    "the usual way of treating the problem of motion of test particle and the roche geometry in the gravitational field of a binary system consists in introducing a coordinate system ( xyz ) , rotating jointly with the components .",
    "the x - axis passes through the centers of both components , and the y - axis is situated in the orbital plane ; but there are more possibilities to locate the origin of the coordinate system . for example",
    "the origin can be located in the mass center of the binary system @xcite , or in the center of the more massive star @xcite .",
    "but there are some papers @xcite , where the location of the origin of the coordinate system is not precisely indicated . for example",
    "huang ( 1967 ) wrote : `` thus , if we denote @xmath0 as the mass of one component , @xmath1 will be the mass of the other .",
    "let us further choose a rotating ( x , y , z ) system such that the origin is at the center of the @xmath0 component , the x - axis points always towards the @xmath1 component , and the @xmath2 plane coincides with the orbital plane . ''",
    "this way to locate the origin of the coordinate system is not an ambiguous one , but it offers the opportunity of the question : what happens with the equations of motion of the test particle and with the geometry of the equipotential curves , in the restricted three - body problem , if the origin of the coordinate system is taken in the center of the less massive star .    the aim of this paper is to answer the question above , by introducing a new notion : the similar coordinate systems .    in order to do so , a binary relation is created , which is denoted by the author as relation of similarity. then , using this relation , the similar coordinate systems , and the necessary similar parameters and physical quantities are defined , obtaining similar equations of motion , and similar equipotential curves .",
    "the conclusion of this study is that the use of similar coordinate systems in the restricted three - body problem allows us to complete the traditional study of the roche geometry with some new features .",
    "in this article we shall write similar ( not similar ) , because we intend to use this word as the name of a new mathematical relation , and not as an adjective .    _ definition _ : two or more mathematical objects are in the similarity relation in connection with a given definition ( @xmath3 ) , if the objects are completely characterized by @xmath3 .    for example :    1 .   in algebra : the numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 are ` similar ' in connection with the definition : _ x is the solution of equation : @xmath6 , @xmath7_. 2 .   in geometry",
    ": if we consider the definition : _ p is the point situated into a given plane ( @xmath8 ) , at the distance @xmath9 from the given point a , @xmath10 _ , then all the points of the circle having the center a and radius @xmath9 are similar. 3 .   in astrophysics : in the frame of the circular restricted three - body problem",
    "_ we define a comoving coordinate system situated in the orbital plane , having the origin in the center of one component of the binary system and the abscissa s axis pointing to the other component_. then the coordinate systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 are ` similar ' ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "( in many books or articles of astronomy , this is the coordinate system s definition used to study the restricted three - body problem @xcite , but usualy only @xmath11 coordinate system is considered . in 1963 , kruszewski wrote : `` the center of coordinates is placed at the center of the ( arbitrarily chosen ) primary component '' @xcite .",
    "this means that if the origin of the coordinate system is taken into the center of the secondary component , the results will be similar . in this article",
    "we try to find what this similarity implies . )",
    "the study of the restricted three - body problem in similar coordinate systems follows the classical algorithm , but some typical peculiarities appear .",
    "so , the use of the similar coordinate systems impose the use of some physical and geometrical similar quantities :    - similar mass ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14    - similar distances @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18    - similar initial velocities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22    - similar initial positions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .    of course , as in algebra the similar solutions of a polynomial equation are connected by the relations of vite , the two similar coordinate systems are connected by the equations of coordinate transformations ( see section 4 ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that the relation of similarity is * reflexive * , * symmetric * , and * transitive*. that means that the relation of similarity is an * equivalence relation*.    _ remark _ :",
    "the role of the definition into the establishment of a similarity is huge .",
    "so , if we consider the definition : _ x is the solution of equation : @xmath6 , @xmath27 _ , the numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not ` similar ' .",
    "2 .   the solutions of a problem ( including the repeated ones ) are in relation of similarity , because these can be defined as satisfying the same problem .",
    "in the frame of the circular , restricted three - body problem @xcite , we will consider @xmath28 and @xmath29 the components of a binary system , @xmath30 and @xmath31 their masses and @xmath32 , @xmath33 the lagrangian points . due to the normalization ( see section 4 ) , the distance between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is equal to 1 .",
    "we will consider _ a rectangular coordinate system , so that one component of the binary star has coordinates ( 0,0,0 ) , the other one has coordinates ( 1,0,0 ) , and the angular keplerian velocity @xmath34 has components @xmath35_. we observe immediately that there are two coordinate systems : ( @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 ) , which can be built .",

    "we have three differential equations of motion of second degree , therefore the initial conditions consist in three initial positions and three initial velocities .",
    "but in the following we shall consider the motion of the test particle in the orbital plane , so the equations of motion will be ( 11)-(12 ) and ( 14)-(15 ) respectively . by consequence",

    "if all the three conditions are considered , there is only one possibility ( see figure 4 ( c ) for an acute angle formed by the initial velocity vector and the positive abscissa s semi - axis ) .",
    "as a numerical application in figure 5 , there are given two similar trajectories for the binary system earth - moon ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
