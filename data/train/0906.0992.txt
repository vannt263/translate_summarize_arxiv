    "the model of directed polymers in random environment appeared first in the physics literature as an attempt to modelize roughening in domain wall in the @xmath2-ising model due to impurities @xcite .",
    "it then reached the mathematical community in @xcite , and in @xcite , where the author applied martingale techniques that have became the major technical tools in the study of this model since then .",
    "a lot of progress has been made recently in the mathematical understanding of directed polymer model ( see for example @xcite and @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is known that there is a phase transition from a delocalized phase at high temperature , where the behavior of the polymer is diffusive , to a localized phase , where it is expected that the influence of the media is relevant in order to produce nontrivial phenomenons , such as super - diffusivity .",
    "these two different situations are usually referred to as weak and strong disorder , respectively .",
    "a simple characterization of this dichotomy is given in terms of the limit of a certain positive martingale related to the partition function of this model .",
    "it is known that in low dimensions ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , the polymer is essentially in the strong disorder phase ( see @xcite , for more precise results ) , but for @xmath5 , there is a nontrivial region of temperatures where weak disorder holds .",
    "a weak form of invariance principle is proved in @xcite .",
    "however , the exact value of the critical temperature which separates the two regions ( when it is finite ) remains an open question . it is known exactly in the case of directed polymers on the tree , where a complete analysis is available ( see @xcite ) . in the case of @xmath6 , for @xmath7 ,",
    "an @xmath8 computation yields an upper bound on the critical temperature , which is however known not to coincide with this bound ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    we choose to study the same model of directed polymers on diamond hierarchical lattices .",
    "these lattices present a very simple structure allowing to perform a lot of computations together with a richer geometry than the tree ( see remark [ convexity - tree ] for more details ) .",
    "they have been introduced in physics in order to perform exact renormalization group computations for spin systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed treatment of more general hierarchical lattices can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for an overview of the extensive literature on ising and potts models on hierarchical lattices , we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein . whereas statistical mechanics model on trees have to be considered as mean - field versions of the original models , the hierarchical lattice models are in many sense very close to the models on @xmath6 ; they are a very powerful tool to get an intuition for results and proofs on the more complex @xmath6 models ( for instance , the work on hierarchical pinning model in @xcite lead to a solution of the original model in @xcite . in the same manner , the present work has been a great source of inspiration for @xcite ) .",
    "directed polymers on hierarchical lattices ( with bond disorder ) appeared in @xcite ( see also @xcite for directed first - passage percolation ) .",
    "more recently , these lattice models raised the interest of mathematicians in the study of random resistor networks ( @xcite ) , pinning / wetting transitions ( @xcite ) and diffusion on a percolation cluster ( @xcite )",
    ".    we can also mention @xcite where the authors consider a random analogue of the hierarchical lattice , where at each step , each bond transforms either into a series of two bonds or into two bonds in parallel , with probability @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "our aim in this paper is to describe the properties of the quenched free energy of directed polymers on hierarchical lattices with site disorder at high temperature :    * first , to be able to decide , in all cases , if the quenched and annealed free energy differ at low temperature . *",
    "if they do , we want to be able to describe the phase transition and to compute the critical exponent .",
    "we choose to focus on the model with site disorder , whereas @xcite focus on the model with _",
    "bond disorder _ where computations are simpler .",
    "we do so because we believe that this model is closer to the model of directed polymer in @xmath11 ( in particular , because of the inhomogeneity of the green function ) , and because there exists a nice recursive construction of the partition functions in our case , that leads to a martingale property .",
    "apart from that , both models are very similar , and we will shortly talk about the bound disorder model in section [ bddis ] .",

    "it can be improved in order to obtain the same bound as for gaussian environments stated in @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , it is believed that it is not of the optimal order , similar to the case of directed polymers on @xmath6 .",
    "[ convexity - tree ] the strict convexity of the free energy is an interesting property .",
    "it is known that it holds also for the directed polymer on @xmath6 but not on the tree . in the later case ,",
    "the free energy is strictly convex only for values of @xmath63 smaller than the critical value @xmath70 ( to be defined latter ) and it is linear on @xmath71 .",
    "this fact is related to the particular structure of the tree that leads to major simplifications in the correlation structure of the model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the strict convexity , in our setting , arises essentially from the property that two path on the hierarchical lattice can re - interesect after being separated at some step .",
    "this underlines once more , that @xmath6 and the hierarchical lattice have a lot of features in common , which they do not share with the tree .",
