    "the variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) method and the more sophisticated diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) method  @xcite can yield highly accurate energies for many - electron systems .",
    "one of the main attractions of these methods is that the cost of calculating the energy of @xmath1 quantum particles scales roughly as @xmath2@xmath3 , which is better than other many - body wave function techniques .",
    "however , although the scaling with particle number is quite advantageous , the cost increases rapidly with the atomic number @xmath0 of the atoms involved .",
    "theoretical estimates of this scaling  @xcite for dmc calculations have varied from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , while a practical test  @xcite indicated a scaling of about @xmath6 .",
    "numerous all - electron dmc studies have been reported  @xcite for atoms up to @xmath7 , but very few have included heavier atoms .",
    "dmc studies of heavier atoms have normally used pseudopotentials to remove the chemically inert core electrons from the problem .",
    "however , pseudopotentials inevitably introduce some errors and it may be useful to consider how much progress can be made with all - electron dmc calculations .",
    "accurate all - electron calculations for atoms may also be useful in constructing pseudopotentials which incorporate many - body effects . in this paper",
    "we report vmc and dmc calculations for the noble gas atoms he , ne , ar , kr , and xe , which extends the range of atoms studied within vmc and dmc up to @xmath8 .",
    "the main aims of this paper are to investigate how well current all - electron dmc methods perform for heavy atoms and to study the scaling of the computational cost with @xmath0 .",
    "in vmc the energy is calculated as the expectation value of the hamiltonian with an approximate many - body trial wave function containing a number of variable parameters . in dmc the estimate of the ground state energy",
    "is improved by performing an evolution of the wave function in imaginary time.@xcite the fermionic symmetry is maintained by the fixed - node approximation  @xcite , in which the nodal surface of the wave function is constrained to equal that of a trial wave function .",
    "our dmc algorithm is essentially that of umrigar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and we employ the modifications to the green function for all - electron calculations proposed in that paper .",
    "all of our vmc and dmc calculations were performed using the casino code.@xcite    our trial wave functions were of the standard slater - jastrow form , @xmath9 the jastrow factors , @xmath10 , were chosen to be functions of the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the position of electron @xmath14 with respect to the nucleus .",
    "our jastrow factors  @xcite for he , ne , ar , kr , and xe contained a total of 26 , 75 , 79 , 80 , and 54 adjustable parameters , respectively.@xcite the optimal parameter values were obtained by minimizing the variance of the energy within a vmc procedure.@xcite the slater determinants , @xmath15 , were formed from single - particle orbitals obtained from hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations using ( i ) numerical integration on a radial grid , and ( ii ) gaussian basis sets and the crystal98 code.@xcite although the numerical orbitals are the more accurate they are not available for molecular systems , in which gaussian basis sets are very commonly used .    in both vmc and",
    "dmc the energy is calculated as an average over a set of electron configurations of the local energy , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the hamiltonian .",
    "the presence of core electrons causes two related problems .",
    "the first is that the shorter length scale variations in the wave function near a nucleus of large @xmath0 require the use of a small timestep .",
    "the second problem is that the fluctuations in the local energy tend to be large near the nucleus , because both the kinetic and potential energies are large .",
    "although these fluctuations can be reduced by optimizing the trial wave function , in practice they are large for heavier atoms .    at a nucleus the exact wave function has a cusp  @xcite such that the divergence in the potential energy is canceled by an equal and opposite divergence in the kinetic energy .",
    "a determinant of exact hf orbitals obeys the electron - nucleus cusp condition .",
    "however , gaussian functions are smooth , and a determinant of such orbitals can not have a cusp , so the local energy diverges at the nucleus . in practice one",
    "finds wild oscillations in the local energy close to the nucleus , which increase the variance of the energy in vmc calculations and lead to timestep errors and even numerical instabilities in dmc calculations . to solve this problem",
    "we make small corrections to the single - particle orbitals close to the nucleus , which impose the correct cusp behavior.@xcite",
    "the main results of our hf , vmc , and dmc calculations are shown in table  [ table : total_energies ] .",
    "our hf energy for he with gaussian orbitals is very close to the result with the `` exact '' numerical orbitals , indicating the high quality of the gaussian basis set used . for",
    "ne the hf energy with gaussian orbitals is a little higher than the value with the numerical orbitals , although this difference is not large enough to affect the dmc results .",
    "we experimented with various gaussian basis sets for the heavier noble gas atoms and found that the basis set errors at the hf level tend to increase significantly with atomic number . in the case of xe",
    "our best gaussian basis set gave an error of 0.11  a.u .",
    "for ar , kr , and xe we therefore used only the numerical orbitals .",
    "the exact ground - state wave function of a two - electron atom is a nodeless function of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , which is the same form as our trial wave function for he .",
    "we therefore expect to obtain a highly accurate trial wave function for he .",
    "we refer to the difference in the hf and dmc energies as the `` dmc correlation energy '' . if one keeps the orbitals fixed and varies the jastrow factor , then the lowest energy one could obtain is the dmc energy .",
    "the percentage of the dmc correlation energy retrieved at the vmc level is therefore a measure of the quality of the jastrow factor . from the data in table",
    "[ table : total_energies ] we find that our vmc calculations retrieve 99.5% , 91% , 85% , 70% , and 59% of the dmc correlation energy for he , ne , ar , kr , and xe , respectively .",
    "we believe that the decrease in the quality of the jastrow factor with increasing @xmath0 arises from the increasing inhomogeneity of the atoms .",
    "creating accurate jastrow factors for all - electron studies of heavy atoms is a challenging problem .",
    ".total energies of the noble gas atoms , and the percentages of the correlation energies , @xmath21 , retrieved .",
    "( g ) denotes a calculation with a gaussian basis set and ( n ) denotes numerical orbitals .",
    "the `` exact '' energies were obtained from data in the indicated references . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     we found that the computational cost of moving all the electrons in a configuration scaled as @xmath22 in our dmc calculations .",
    "this is rather better than the scalings assumed by ceperley  @xcite ( @xmath23 ) and by hammond _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "if we studied a system containing many atoms , the scaling of the computational cost for moving all the electrons in a configuration would be expected to increase roughly as @xmath2 , although the use of localized wannier functions could reduce this to @xmath1.@xcite    putting together our scalings for the factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_final ] ) we find @xmath25 we can now compare this with the actual dmc computations reported in table  [ table : total_energies ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] we show the logarithm of the cpu time as a function of @xmath0 for a given standard error of the mean .",
    "the best fit gives a scaling of @xmath26 , in good agreement with the prediction of @xmath27 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_final ] ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", our dmc results for the heavier atoms suffer from significant timestep errors .",
    "if we adopt the @xmath28 scaling for the timestep instead of the @xmath29 used above , we obtain an overall scaling of @xmath30 , which is higher than the value of @xmath31 obtained in the practical tests of hammond _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite moreover , it seems likely that an even more rapid scaling would be required to achieve a timestep error independent of @xmath0 .",
    "we have applied the vmc and dmc methods to noble gas atoms up to xe ( @xmath8 ) , using slater - jastrow wave functions with hartree - fock single - particle orbitals .",
    "the percentage of the dmc correlation energy obtained at the vmc level decreases with @xmath0 , indicating that the quality of our jastrow factors decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "the percentage of the exact correlation energy retrieved at the dmc level also decreases with @xmath0 , indicating that the quality of the hf nodal surface deteriorates with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "our study shows that ceperley s expression  @xcite for the variance of the dmc energy ( eq .  ( [ eq : ceperley_sigma^2 ] ) ) is accurate to better than a factor of two for the systems studied here .",
    "the computational cost required to obtain a fixed statistical error bar in the energy scaled as @xmath26 , but in these calculations the timestep error increased significantly with @xmath0 . the scaling required to achieve a timestep error independent of @xmath0 is difficult to estimate , but it would certainly be higher than @xmath26",
    ". however , it may well be reasonable to incur substantial timestep errors deep in the core of the atom when we calculate chemical properties which are related to the valence electrons .",
