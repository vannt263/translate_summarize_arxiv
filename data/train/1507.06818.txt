    "let @xmath14 be a graph where each vertex maintains an opinion , which we speak of in terms of two colours - red and blue .",
    "we make no assumptions about the properties of the colours / opinions except that vertices can distinguish between them .",
    "we are interested in distributed protocols on @xmath0 that can bring about consensus to a single opinion .",
    "one of the simplest and most widely studied distributed consensus algorithms is the _ voter model _ ( see ,",
    "e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  14 ) ) . in the discrete time",
    "setting , at each time step @xmath15 , each vertex chooses a single neighbour uniformly at random ( ) and assumes its opinion .",
    "the number of different opinions in the system is clearly non - increasing , and consensus is reached almost surely in finite , non - bipartite , connected graphs .",
    "using an elegant martingale argument , @xcite determined the probability of consensus to a particular colour . in our context",
    "this would be the sum of the degrees of vertices which started with that colour , as a fraction of the sum of degrees over all vertices .",
    "thus , on regular graphs , for example , if the initial proportion of reds is a constant @xmath6 , the probability of a red consensus is @xmath6 .",
    "this probability is increased on non - regular graphs if the minority is `` privileged '' by sitting on high degree vertices ( as in say , for example , the small proportion of high degree vertices in a graph with power - law distribution ) .",
    "this motivates an alternative where the majority is certain , or highly likely , to win .",
    "the _ local majority _ protocol in a synchronous discrete time setting does the following : at each time step , each vertex @xmath2 polls all its neighbours and assumes the majority colour in the next time step .",
    "this can be motivated by both a prescriptive and a descriptive view . in the former , as a consensus protocol , it can be seen as a distributed co - ordination mechanism for networked systems . in the latter ,",
    "it can be seen as a natural process occurring , for example in social networks where it may represent the spread of influence .",
    "let @xmath1 be odd .",
    "suppose at time step @xmath16 each vertex of a graph @xmath14 is either red or blue .",
    "in this paper we study the following generalisation of the local majority protocol ( also in a synchronous , discrete time setting ) :    for each vertex @xmath17 , for each time step @xmath18 do the following : choose a set of @xmath1 neighbours of @xmath2 uniformly at random .",
    "the colour of @xmath2 at time step @xmath15 is the majority colour of this set at time step @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath2 does not have @xmath1 neighbours , then choose a random set of largest possible odd cardinality .",
    "clearly , we can retrieve the local majority protocol by setting @xmath1 to be the maximum degree , for example .",
    "in addition to which colour dominates , one is also interested in how long it takes to reach consensus . in the voter model",
    ", there is a duality between the voting process and multiple random walks on the graph .",
    "the time it takes for a single opinion to emerge is the same as the time it takes for @xmath20 independent random walks - one starting at each vertex - to coalesce into a single walk , where two or more random walks coalesce if they are on the same vertex at the same time .",
    "thus , consensus time can be determined by studying this multiple walk process . however , the analyses of local - majority - type protocols have not been readily amenable to the established techniques for the voter model , namely , martingales and coalescing random walks .",
    "martingales have proved elusive and the random walks duality does not readily transfer , nor is there an obvious way of altering the walks appropriately .",
    "thus , ad - hoc techniques and approaches have been developed .",
    "we say a sequence of events @xmath21 occurs _ with high probability _",
    "( ) if @xmath22 as @xmath23 . in this paper , the underlying parameter @xmath9 which goes to infinity will be the number of vertices in the sequence of graphs @xmath24 we consider .",
    "the main result in this paper will be to show that when each vertex of a preferential attachment graph @xmath24 ( introduced in the next section ) is red independently with probability @xmath25 , where @xmath13 is sufficiently biased away from @xmath26 , then the system will converge to the majority colour with high probability , and we give an upper bound for the number of steps this takes .",
    "the preferential attachment models have their origins in the work of yule @xcite , where a growing model is proposed in the context of the evolution of species .",
    "a similar model was proposed by simon @xcite in the statistics of language .",
    "the principle of these models was used by albert and barabsi @xcite to describe a random graph model where vertices arrive one by one and each of them throws a number of half - edges to the existing graph .",
    "each half - edge is connected to a vertex with probability that is proportional to the degree of the latter .",
    "this model was defined rigorously by bollobs , riordan , spencer and tusndy  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we will describe the most general form of the model which is essentially due to dorogovtsev et al .",
    "@xcite and drinea et al .",
    "our description and notation below follows that from the book of van der hofstad  @xcite .    the random graph @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] is parameterised by two constants : @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "it gives rise to a random graph sequence ( i.e. , a sequence in which each member is a random graph ) , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath9th term of the sequence , @xmath24 is a graph with @xmath9 vertices and @xmath33 edges .",
    "further , @xmath24 is a subgraph of @xmath34 .",
    "we define @xmath35 first , then use it to define the general model @xmath24 ( the barabsi - albert model corresponds to the case @xmath36 ) .    the random graph @xmath37 consists of a single vertex with one self - loop .",
    "we denote the vertices of @xmath35 by @xmath38 .",
    "we denote the degree of vertex @xmath39 in @xmath35 by @xmath40 .",
    "then , conditionally on @xmath35 , the growth rule to obtain @xmath41 is as follows : we add a single vertex @xmath42 having a single edge .",
    "the other end of the edge connects to @xmath42 itself with probability @xmath43 , and connects to a vertex @xmath44 with probability @xmath45  we write @xmath46 .",
    "for any @xmath47 , let @xmath48=\\{1,\\ldots , t \\}$ ] .",

    "edges shared between a set of contracted vertices become loops in the contracted super - vertex .",
    "thus , @xmath24 is a graph on @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the above process gives a graph whose degree distribution follows a power law with exponent @xmath57 .",
    "this was suggested by the analyses in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it was proved rigorously for integral @xmath58 by buckley and osthus  @xcite . for a full proof for real @xmath58 see  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath59 , the exponent is between 2 and 3 .",
    "experimental evidence has shown that this is the case for several networks that emerge in applications ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore , when @xmath60 , then @xmath24 is  connected , but when @xmath61 this is not the case , giving rise to a logarithmic number of components ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath62 be odd and let @xmath63 if @xmath11 is odd and @xmath64 if @xmath11 is even .",
    "let @xmath65 be the smallest positive solution for @xmath66 in the equation @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 and each vertex in @xmath69 is red independently with probability @xmath70 , then for any constant @xmath71 ,  under @xmath72 every vertex in @xmath69 is blue at all time steps @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath36 gives the model proposed in the seminal work of albert and barabsi @xcite , giving power law exponent @xmath4 , and that @xmath74 gives exponents larger than @xmath4 .",

    ", the same protocol was studied on random graphs of a given degree sequence ( which includes random regular graphs ) and erds  rnyi random graphs slightly above the connectivity threshold .",
    "similar results similar to theorem [ maintheorem ] were obtained , and in the case of the former model , an almost matching lower bound was shown .",
    "it should be noted that the thresholds for @xmath13 obtained in this work apply equally to the models in @xcite , and improve the thresholds for @xmath13 .",
    "to contrast , in that paper , the thresholds for @xmath75 were @xmath79 to 3 s.f .",
    ", respectively .    in @xcite , ( full ) local majority dynamics on @xmath80-regular @xmath81-expanders on @xmath20 vertices is studied . in our notation , they show that when @xmath82 , there is convergence to the initial majority , so long as @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath84 for a @xmath80-regular graph , this condition implies @xmath85 .",
    "in contrast , our results apply for @xmath10 .    in @xcite",
    "a variant of local majority is studied where a vertex contacts @xmath11 others and if @xmath80 of them have the same colour , the vertex subsequently assumes this colour .",
    "they demonstrate convergence time of @xmath86 and error probability  the probability of converging on the initial minority  decaying exponentially with @xmath20 .",
    "however , the analysis is done only for the complete graph ; our analysis of sparse graphs is a crucial difference , because the techniques employed for complete graphs do not carry through to sparse graphs , nor are they easily adapted .",
    "the error probability we give is not as strong but still strong , nevertheless .",
    "furthermore , the convergence time we give is much smaller .    in @xcite the authors study the following protocol on random regular graphs and regular expanders : each vertex picks two neighbours at random , and takes the majority of these with itself .",
    "they show convergence to the initial majority in @xmath86 steps with high probability , subject to sufficiently large initial bias and high enough vertex degree .",
    "however , in their setting , the placement of colours can be made adversarially .    in summary , our contribution is demonstrating convergence and time of convergence to initial majority for a generalisation of local majority dynamics for preferential attachment graphs with power - law exponent @xmath4 and above .",
    "as far as we know this is the only such result for power - law graphs ( by preferential attachment or otherwise ) .",
    "furthermore , we have improved the bias thesholds for graphs of a given degree sequence studied by the first author in @xcite , which , to the best of our knowledge , were already the best or only known results for small degree graphs in this class ( which includes , e.g. , random regular graphs ) .",
