    "we introduced diffusive couplings @xmath12 in eqs .",
    "( [ fiber_1 ] ) as electrical interactions between two excitable fibers . in general , however , most nerve axons are insulated by a lipid material called the _ myelin sheath _ with periodic gaps of exposure called the _ nodes of ranvier _ in order to increase the speed and the reliability of conduction of pulses  @xcite . because the myelin sheath reduces current flow that leaks out across the membrane , the electrical interaction between neighboring axons surrounded by myelin sheaths is very weak",
    "; hence it is said that the effect of electric coupling between axons is negligible  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite have also shown that the relative locations of the nodes of ranvier on two neighboring myelinated nerve axons influence the degree of synchronization between propagating pulses .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our study to incorporate a spatially inhomogeneous structure such as the myelin sheath and the nodes of ranvier into the system of eqs .",
    "( [ fiber_1 ] ) for actual biological applications .",
    "such a property could be an interesting topic of future work .",
    "on the other hand , it is also known that there are nerve bundles composed of _ unmyelinated _ axons .",
    "in fact , olfactory nerve axons are unmyelinated and arranged in densely packed bundles  @xcite , and the question of whether there are gap junctional couplings between adjacent axons has been also discussed  @xcite .",
    "we have mainly focused on the pulse dynamics when the diffusion coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ fiber_1 ] ) are not equal .",
    "the difference between coefficients might correspond to the difference in the diameters of the two nerve axons .",
    "such an assumption is quite natural when considering real nerve axons .",
    "thus , real neural systems should have the ability to produce a wide variety of pulse dynamics similar to the ones shown in the present paper .",
    "our results strongly suggest that a nerve axon is not only a cable for transmitting an input signal to the terminal but also a functional element that can process input information by",
    " crosstalk \" between adjacent axons in a bundle  @xcite .",
    "such crosstalk is not desirable for the purpose of precise conduction of the input pulse , and may be also involved in serious neural diseases such as multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , which is caused by the loss of the myelin sheath  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the electrical interaction between lesioned nerve axons is an origin of neuropathic pain such as hyperalgesia and allodynia  @xcite . on the other hand , crosstalk among nerve axons",
    "may play a constructive role in the brain . in  @xcite , it is suggested that electrical interactions between neighboring axons in the olfactory nerves contribute to olfactory discrimination by modulating the frequency of the action potentials in neighboring axons and by enhancing the degree of synchronization between their firings .",
    "such a situation can be also found in mossy fibers in the hippocampus .",
    "the structure of hippocampal mossy fibers is similar to that of the olfactory nerves ; i.e. , the nerve axons are unmyelinated and arranged in densely packed bundles .",
    "thus , electrical axo - axonal interactions may occur in mossy fibers and are likely to impact the mechanism of neuronal integration  @xcite .",
    "a recent experimental study revealed that depolarization at an axon terminal strongly influences the efficiency of synaptic transmission in mossy fibers  @xcite . in our simple mathematical model ,",
    "a pulse in a fiber influences the propagation of pulses in the other fibers .",
    "indeed , synchronization and locking between propagating pulses are established depending on the parameter , i.e. , the coupling strength between fibers , and the difference between the intra - diffusion coefficients .",
    "the interspike interval in the early stage of propagation will change as the pulse travel in fibers .",
    "thus , synchronization and locking regulate the interspike interval .",
    "this fact implies that synaptic transmission might be affected by electrical axo - axonal interactions in real neuronal systems .",
    "various types of pulse dynamics caused by axo - axonal interactions in the nerve bundle may act as information processing in the brain  @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper provide a new insight into the functional aspects of nerve axons .",
