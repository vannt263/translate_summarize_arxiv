    "consequently , structures of the first generation galaxies are seeded . shortly after the forming of proto - galaxies , the hydrogen and helium gases within them begin to condensate and make the first stars . in the formation of any astrophysical body ,",
    "self - gravity is beyond question one of the key factors in determining the specific destinies of stars , quasars , black holes , and neutron stars .",
    "for example , the self - gravity of neutron stars is considered using the affine model  @xcite , where the effective relativistic self - gravitational potential is approximated with tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) stellar structure equations .",
    "indeed , gravity , though much weaker than the other three fundamental forces , i.e. , strong , weak and electromagnetic forces , with its long range of action and omnipresent character from equivalence principle of general relativity , determines most astronomical evolutions .",
    "one persuasive example showing the significance of self - gravity is the boson star .",
    "though massive boson stars are prevented from the heisenberg uncertainty principle , they can actually be formed in the early universe when the self - interaction of scalar particles is considered  @xcite .",
    "various methods are subsequently developed to study different features of boson stars .",
    "people deal with a system of self - gravitating bosons either by solving the schrdinger and poisson equations in a newtonian way  @xcite , or by fully accounting the relativistic effect using klein - gordon and einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "when the einstein gravity and the klein - gordon field couple with each other , exotic bosons which possess a small mass may undergo bose - einstein condensation driven by gravity and collapse to form boson stars in the early universe or latter in galaxy center as a candidate for dark matter  @xcite .",
    "if self - gravity can trigger phenomena at the early universe so dramatic like boson stars or primordial black holes  @xcite not mentioned before , the self - gravitational effect in the primordial patch of the early universe should not be easily discarded without a robust proof .",
    "an exact evaluation of the self - gravity of relativistic particles at the extremely high energy scale before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( not high enough to reach the boson star critical temperature ) becomes unavoidable .",
    "however , most discussions of boson stars are at relatively high energy scale @xmath2  gev  @xcite , and at the same time entail the non - zero mass of scalar particles to be greater than around 10  ev to preserve radial stability  @xcite .",
    "but during the radiation dominated era before bbn , main ingredients are massless photons , and the homogeneity of the early patch is preserved unlike that in boson stars . as a result , it is difficult to fully perceive the self - gravitational behavior of photons in the early universe by simply extending the methods developed for boson stars .",
    "although there are several attempts to include the self - gravitational effect of non - relativistic gases at equilibrium , such as monte carlo simulations , analytic mean field methods and low density expansions  @xcite , no method so far exists to directly solve the self - gravity of massless particles , i.e. , photons . as a result , we try to develop an appropriate way to deal with the self - gravity of massless bosons in the early universe .",

    ", the universe can be well described as in thermal equilibrium with very high temperature and frequent interactions .",
    "remarkable features of the early universe , homogeneity , isotropy and thermal equilibrium together can help us simplify the discussion to a great extent . since the equation of state ( eos ) can serve as a good description of a homogeneous systems , we manage to delve into the problem with statistical physics .",
    "as is well known , once including self - interactions between particles , the corresponding partition function shall be changed .",
    "such change further leads to modifications in the eos .",
    "we try to uncover the self - gravitational effect by examining the corresponding statistical properties of bose and fermi gases first . whether corrections from self - gravity",
    "are negligible or bear some new features not considered before shall be tested in detail in this work .    in the radiation - dominated epoch , gravities between relativistic particles",
    "are commonly neglected in existing models .",
    "when the temperature of the universe decreases to approximately @xmath3 , particles are in thermal equilibrium without strong nuclear interactions and the principal ingredients at that time are photons , neutrinos , electrons and their anti - particles . with the energy of the universe dominated by photons , other ingredients , whether massive particles like electrons and positrons or the massless ones , all behave radiation - like due to their frequent collisions with photons and each other at the ultra - high temperature .",

    "though still very small of the magnitude @xmath130 , increases over time as the temperature cooling down dramatically and finally becomes significant in the matter - dominated era when both homogeneity and isotropy break down and the eos description is no longer appropriate .",
    "as to the evolution of the background metric , we find that self - gravity of any kind will not strongly affect the conventional result using eos of ideal relativistic and non - relativistic boson and fermion statistics .",
    "thus the previously not fully justified negligence of self - gravity is theoretically studied from a statistical perspective when dealing with cosmic evolution before bbn . however",
    ", our study is restricted to a given temperature range , and the same result may no longer be true at the very early stage of the universe as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq27++ ] ) . at a much earlier epoch ,",
    "when the volume of the universe is small enough with the basic assumption of our statistical approach of thermal equilibrium still satisfied , self - gravity may no longer be negligible from our result .",
    "thus , further study should be carried out at much earlier stages to give a complete evaluation on the effects of self - gravity and then the back - reaction .",
