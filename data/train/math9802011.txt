    "the building block for many invariants of plane curve singularities like the monodromy , the intersection form , the seifert form , coxeter - dynkin diagrams , the mixed hodge structure on the vanishing cohomology and the spectral pairs is the first integral homology group of the milnor fiber or  which is the same  the abelianized fundamental group of the milnor fiber .",
    "the restriction to the abelianized version of this fundamental group causes some serious limitations .",
    "e.  g.  l dng trng @xcite proved that for irreducible plane curve singularities the monodromy ( on homology ) has finite order .",
    "@xcite was the first to discover that the monodromy on the fundamental group of the milnor fiber ( where the one boundary component is collapsed to one point , the basepoint ) has infinite order , whenever the singularity has at least two puiseux pairs .",
    "this shows that the monodromy on the fundamental group is richer than on homology .    for the study of analytical invariants of plane curve singularities , the first ( co)homology group is of particular interest because of hodge theory .",
    "deligne @xcite introduced in 1970/71 the notion of mixed hodge structure ( mhs ) and showed that the cohomology of any complex algebraic variety carries such a mhs in a natural way .",
    "schmid @xcite and steenbrink @xcite determined a limit - mhs of a variation of hodge structures coming from families of compact algebraic manifolds .",
    "this provided the background for the definition of the mhs on the vanishing cohomology of hypersurface singularities by steenbrink @xcite . in the case of plane curve",
    "singularities this is a mhs on the first cohomology group of the milnor fiber .",
    "however , due to the fact that for irreducible plane curve singularities the monodromy on homology is finite , families of mutually right - left  but not necessarily right - equivalent plane curve singularities all have isomorphic mhss on the vanishing cohomology .",
    "this holds , for example , for the family @xmath1 which is the singularity with puiseux expansion @xmath2    in 1987 hain @xcite , @xcite used chen s iterated integrals to generalize deligne s construction of a mhs on cohomology to a construction of a mhs on the homotopy lie algebra for any complex algebraic variety with base point .",
    "in particular , this object contains a mhs which is called _ the mhs on the fundamental group_. already before , in 1978 , morgan @xcite had used sullivan s minimal models to put a mhs on the homotopy lie algebra of _ smooth _ complex algebraic varieties .",
    "hain also showed , in @xcite , that the local system of homotopy groups associated with a topologically trivial family of smooth pointed varieties underlies a good variation of @xmath3-mhss , which implies by the earlier work of steenbrink and zucker @xcite that there is a limit @xmath3-mhs .",
    "this provides the background of the problem we study in this paper : is there a generalization of the mhs on the vanishing ( co)homology to something like ` a mhs on the fundamental group of the general milnor fiber ' in the case of plane curve singularities ?    in this article",
    "we show that the construction of such a generalization is possible and we will call it _ the mixed hodge structure on the nearby fundamental group of a plane curve singularity_. we develop a theory that allows us to take iterated integrals along certain paths in the central fiber .",
    "these paths mimic paths in the regular fiber .",
    "the given approach seems to be even new for the integration of elements in the vanishing cohomology . due to this integration theory , the constructed mhs is defined over the integers .",
    "for instance in the family @xmath4 defined on page this @xmath0-mhs detects the modulus .",
    "the above formulated problem is the guideline of the paper .",
    "we consider first the situation of a degenerating family @xmath5 of compact riemann surfaces with @xmath6 boundary components over the disk @xmath7 , where the singular fiber , the fiber over @xmath8 , is a divisor with normal crossings @xmath9 .",
    "its components are compact closed riemann surfaces , except for the @xmath6 components @xmath10 , which are disks",
    ". such a degenerating family can be constructed from a plane curve singularity @xmath11 by a process that is called ` semistable reduction ' ( see [ semistable ] ) .",
    "each of the disks @xmath10 corresponds to a branch of @xmath11 .    in this situation ,",
    "we want to mimic a path in a regular fiber by a path in the central fiber .",
    "let us give a finite version of the ideas that we develop in an infinitesimal way in chapter [ rietgans ] .",
    "intuitively it is clear that the difficulties for this mimicry arise at the double points of the divisor with normal crossings @xmath12 , which are all given locally by an equation : @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 , this equation gives within the central fiber ( locally ) a 1 - 1 relation between points off the double point in one component and points off the double point in the other .",
    "this is obviously not true for @xmath15 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "we consider then paths @xmath16 that approach the double point in one component and leave it in the other component in such a way that locally for all @xmath17 holds : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the double point . by the identification that is sketched in figure [ madonna ] , these paths can be thought of as being in the fiber over @xmath20 .    in this picture one",
    "can also observe that if @xmath21 is big , the path in the central fiber has to make a big detour compared to the corresponding path in the regular fiber .",
    "therefore , the speed with which the path in the central fiber approaches and leaves the double point is a measure for the distance between the central fiber and the regular fiber in which the ` regular path ' lives .",
    "we give an infinitesimal version of this idea in [ verspannung ] . given a non zero tangent vector @xmath22 in the tangent plane @xmath23 of the base space @xmath24 and a non zero tangent vector @xmath25 in the tangent plane @xmath26 at the disk @xmath27 , we introduce the notion of _ a path over @xmath22 based at @xmath25_. moreover , we define a _ homotopy over @xmath22 based at @xmath25 _ or shorter , a _ nearby homotopy _ , in such a way that the set of all _ nearby homotopy classes _ becomes a group that we denote by : @xmath28 the @xmath29 form a local system on @xmath30 , which is isomorphic to a corresponding local system that comes from the fundamental groups on the regular fibers ( see [ dr . yoghurt ] on page ) .",
    "denote by @xmath31 the augmentation ideal of the group ring @xmath32 . in the chapters [ quark ] and [ bl\"omscher ]",
    ", we will define for all @xmath33 a @xmath0-mhs on @xmath34 this will be done by putting a @xmath0-mhs on @xmath35 , the dual of @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "the main ingredient for the definition of these @xmath0-mhss is a differential graded algebra ( dga ) @xmath39 , which is made up from differential forms on the central fiber but whose cohomology is isomorphic to the cohomology of the regular fiber .",
    "it was suggested to us by hain is in principle a modified version of the complex @xmath40 $ ] of @xcite for this special situation with non compact fibers . ] to use a dga like @xmath39 and he proposed the problem of finding a way to integrate elements of this dga along some kind of paths in the central fiber .",
    "we discovered that the right notion of _ path _ for this purpose turned out to be the notion of a path over @xmath22 ( based at @xmath25 ) .",
    "we will show that closed elements in @xmath41 can be integrated along paths in @xmath42 over @xmath22 in a natural way .",
    "this yields an integral structure on @xmath43 , which is by this integration dual to @xmath44 .",
    "on @xmath39 we have filtrations @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that the induced filtrations together with the integral structure define a @xmath0-mhs on @xmath43 ( see theorem [ rothalsgans ] on page ) .",
    "since @xmath39 has an _ algebra _ structure , we can also define _ iterated _ line integrals along paths over @xmath22 .",
    "we shall do this in chapter [ bl\"omscher ] .",
    "this will give a way ( see [ novalis ] ) to describe @xmath47 in terms of the dga @xmath39 , similar to chen s classical @xmath48-de - rham theorem ( cf .",
    "( 4.4 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "these iterated integrals will lead to the definition of a @xmath0-mhs on @xmath49 , and hence to a @xmath0-mhs on ( see [ blaumeise ] ) . and",
    "furthermore , we will see that the variation of @xmath0-mhs for all @xmath50 @xmath51 is a nilpotent orbit of mhs ( see [ maibaum ] and [ blindfisch ] ) .",
    "let @xmath52 be the fundamental group of the central fiber and let @xmath53 be its group ring with augmentation ideal @xmath54 .",
    "we define a mhs on the fundamental group of the central fiber .",
    "this mhs is more or less a special case of the general construction of a mhs on the fundamental group of a complex algebraic varietiy as introduced by hain @xcite .",
    "we show that the obvious group homomorphism @xmath55 induces an inclusion of mhss : @xmath56    in chapter [ kranenburg ] we show how all these considerations can be applied to study plane curve singularities @xmath57 let @xmath20 be a coordinate on @xmath58 .",
    "the tangent vector @xmath59 in @xmath60 yields a finite number of tangent vectors in the base space of the ` semistable reduction ' .",
    "if @xmath61 is a distinguished branch of @xmath11 and @xmath27 the disk corresponding to @xmath61 , then @xmath59 defines a finite number of tangent vectors in @xmath26 in a natural way , which we call _ the monstrance of @xmath62_. we use this to define _ the mhs on the nearby fundamental group of a plane curve singularity @xmath11_. this mhs depends on the tangent vector @xmath59 , which is preserved under right - equivalence . it might be interesting to note in this context that if a right - left - equivalence between two plane curve singularities preserves @xmath59 that then the singularities are right - quivalent",
    "this is a consequence of a result of j.  brianon and h.  skoda ( see [ geburtszange ] ) .",
    "finally we consider the _ mhs on the nearby fundamental group _ of the example on page and show that the extension of @xmath63 by the part of weight @xmath64 of @xmath65 detects the modulus that is hidden for the vanishing cohomology . here",
    "we focus on the effects due to the infinite order of the monodromy .",
    "in general we expect also interesting information from other parts of this mhs on the nearby fundamental group .",
    "even the extension of @xmath63 by @xmath66 given by @xmath67 might contain interesting information .",
    "also the decomposition of the monodromy into a unipotent and a semisimple part has still to be studied .",
    "the ideas described here for plane curve singularities have a counterpart for degenerating families of compact riemann surfaces with a section ( representing the basepoint in each fiber ) .",
    "mutatis mutandis this is a special case of our construction .    in the first two sections we chose to gather a few technical proofs in appendices in order not to cloud the simplicity of the construction .",
    "we recommend to skip these appendices for the first reading .",
    "this paper evolved from my thesis which was accepted at the catholic university of nijmegen .",
    "i am grateful to my advisor , joseph steenbrink for his continuous encouragement .",
    "i owe very much to many valuable conversations with richard hain and david reed during a stay of three months at duke university in spring 1996 and during a short visit of one week in spring 1997 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , richard hain made some very useful suggestions for the problem i was looking at .",
    "finally i would like to thank many people with whom i had interesting discussions and who gave encouragement during the preparation of my thesis .",
    "in this section we describe our concept of _ nearby fundamental group_.      before we study plane curve singularities let us consider the folllowing setting .",
    "we are going to use this setting throughout the whole first three sections of the article .",

    "in general on a manifold one can express iterated integrals over chen - closed linear combinations of tensor products of smooth 1-forms in three different ways as line integrals : first , one can pull back the iterated integral to the parameter interval according to the definition of iterated integrals .",

    "third , one can split up the iterated integral into pieces over parts of the path , which lie in simply connected open sets . in all three cases one",
    "transforms the general iterated integral into an iterated integral on a space , whose dga of differential forms is acyclic .",
    "the idea to prove [ reinhard may ] is to express iterated integrals along paths over @xmath22 in a similar way locally as line integrals along paths over @xmath22 . away from the double points in @xmath42",
    "this can be done like described above .",
    "but around a double point the problem arises that if we restrict our dga @xmath39 in the naive way to a dga living on an open neighbourhood of the double point , still the result will not be an acyclic complex .",
    "after all the dga @xmath39 restricted to a double point computes the cohomology of the vanishing cycle at that double point .    since a path over @xmath22 locally at a double point",
    "is forced to approach the double point in a particular sector we can find simply connected open sets in @xmath42 , which contain all of this ( local ) path apart from the double point itself . if we are given a closed form @xmath574 in @xmath41 then we can find primitives of this form at least on those open sets .",
    "but since @xmath574 may have a simple pole in the double point , these primitives can have logarithmic singularities there .",

    "@xcite , prop .",
    "( 1.3 ) , p.  252 ) .",
    "when one takes an iterated integral over a composition of two paths , one can take primitives of this closed form over each of the paths and has to take care that their values on the junction point match .",
    "for instance in the case of a path which passes only through one double point @xmath77 and changes from one component to another , we would like to decompose this path into three parts : two parts where it stays in one of the components and a third part which is represented by the 1-simplex @xmath486 .",
    "( observe that also in the definition ( a ) on page we thought of @xmath486 as being part of the path @xmath16 . )",
    "but , when we now choose primitives on each of the components of a closed compatible 1-form , in general these primitives have logarithmic singularities at the junction points of the three parts of the path . hence , we can not make their values match .",
    "it will turn out that although we can not make their values match , we can make their formal shapes or the type of their singularity match .",
    "this leads to a kind of _ higher compatibility _ and finally to the definition of the dga @xmath823 . in this way we can then indeed locally express an iterated integral along a path @xmath16 over @xmath22 as line integral of a closed form in @xmath1104 along @xmath16",
    "this construction allows us to prove in the local case convergence , independence of local coordinates around the double points and invariance under nearby homotopies between paths over @xmath22 of iterated integrals of chen - closed elements .    a crucial role in all convergence considerations",
