    "the study of the distribution function of stars in galaxies may give strong constraints on the scenarios of formation of the galaxies .",
    "in the past , a particular attention has been paid to distinguish between isotropic cases , where the distribution function is characterized by only two classical integrals of motion ( energy and angular momentum ) and the anisotropic case , where a third ( unknown ) isolating integral is needed to explain the dynamics of the system .",
    "a widely used tool to investigate the distribution function in elliptical galaxies is the classical @xmath1 parameter , first introduced by binney ( 1978 ) . by applying this method to a large number of elliptical galaxies",
    ", it seems that two , different kind of ellipticals may exist : elliptical galaxies fainter than m@xmath2=19.5 , with outer isophotes quite flat ( disky ) , which are represented well by isotropic models , and bigger ellipticals ( m@xmath3 19.5 ) , with isophotes more `` boxy '' and that can not be explained by a model with isotropic velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the structure and isotropy of the bulges of disk galaxies is far less clear : working on the same set of data , concerning fours s0 and sa galaxies , kormendy & illingworth ( 1982 ) claims the isotropy of their bulges , while whitmore , rubin and ford ( 1985 ) deduce the opposite conclusion .",
    "the fact that the same data may be interpreted in such different ways clearly demonstrates the ambiguity of the @xmath1 test when applied to the bulges .    on the other hand",
    ", the informations about the dynamical structures of the bulges could be crucial to determine if bulges can be considered as `` dwarf ellipticals embedded in a gas disk '' , as stellar populations , colors and luminosity profiles seems to suggest , or if they are a totally different class of objects .",
    "the main problems encountered dealing with models of bulges is the mixing of stars between disk and bulge and the mutual interaction of their potentials .",
    "these effects make harder the problem of to study the `` pure '' bulge component , that require some preliminary assumptions .    in modeling the elliptical galaxies it is common to assume that the isodensity surfaces are similar , concentric spheroids .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the shape of the observed isophotes , and has the great advantage to reduce the complexity of the dynamical equations . as said before ,",
    "in such a case ( ellipsoidal structures ) the @xmath1 test can be applied .    on the other hand ,",
    "the isophotes of bulges in disk galaxies shows many different behaviors , such as wide change of flattening from the center of the galaxy to the outer regions . in this case , it is not possible to apply a simple ellipsoidal model .",
    "this problem is particularly presenting s0 and sa galaxies , where the contributions of the bulge- and disk- components are comparable in strength .    starting from a previous work of galletta ( 1990 ) , we extended the ellipsoidal hypothesis to early - type disk galaxies , assuming that each galaxy may be `` splitted '' in two different components , having each one the following properties :    * the isodensity surfaces are similar concentric spheroids ; * the anisotropy parameter @xmath4 is constant throughout the galaxy ( here , we present only the case @xmath5 of the isotropic model ) .",
    "* the galaxy is rotating about the @xmath6-axis with velocity @xmath7 , consistent with the self - gravity hypothesis . *",
    "each component has a constant @xmath8 ratio .    under these hypothesis ,",
    "the circular velocity due to the potential of each component is given by the well - known form ( see binney & tremaine , 1986 ) : @xmath9 with @xmath10 the ellipticity of the component , and @xmath11 defined as @xmath12    the density profile of the bulge is assumed to follow the @xmath0 law , while the disc ( also `` ellipsoidal '' , but much flatter than the bulge ) is described with an exponential density profile . in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] we present the photometric behavior of a typical galaxy constructed with these assumptions .",
    "_ since we are dealing with the inner kinematical properties of the galaxies , we deliberately discard any dark matter contribution to the overall potential , to limit the number of free parameters .",
    "a first goal of this work was to find out how kinematical ( rotation and velocity dispersion ) curves are changing when different bulge / disk ratios are assumed . under the hypotheses described in the previous section",
    ", we produced several different models for different values of the parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sa ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulge_h ] some of the obtained results are shown .",
    "we want to stress out some points :    * the rotation curves of the galaxies on a plane perpendicular to the main galaxy plane become more and more linear at higher distance from this latter plane .",
    "this is in agreement with the available data for most of the observed spiral bulges ; * on the other hand , the asymmetric drift effect is very strong in the nucleus ; this is due to the steep increase of density for the inner regions of the bulge ( described as a pure @xmath0 model , without any core radius ) . *",
    "the velocity dispersion profile is always * not * gaussian ; more likely , it can be approximated by the sum of two gaussian curves .",
    "as a second goal , we applied our model to the galaxies studied by kormendy and illingworth ( 1982 ) and by whitmore ( 1985 ) . in tab .",
    "1 the best - fit parameters found for all the four galaxies are shown .",
    "our isotropic model fit fairly well the observations ; this is particularly amazing in the case of ngc  4565 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n4565 ] ) , for which both the papers conclude that strong anisotropies in the velocity distribution are present .",
