    "on the number theoretical properties of the geometric structures arising from physics there has been growing interest . though perhaps relatively nascent a field in comparison to the tremendous cross - fertilization which algebraic and differential geometry have enjoyed with gauge and string theories , ever augmenting importance and ever increasing profundity of these number theoretic connections",
    "compel us .",
    "recent developments in investigating calabi - yau varieties over finite fields @xcite , modularity of zeta functions of calabi - yau manifolds @xcite , emergence of modular forms and moonshine behaviour in mirror maps , gromov - witten invariants and matrix models @xcite , and especially geometric perspectives on langlands duality via s - duality @xcite exemplify the incipience of arithmetic within a physical context , in particular with regard to the visions of the langlands programme .",
    "our concern shall be supersymmetric gauge theory , the physics , the geometry , as well as the interplay thereof have established themselves as a canonical subject , of rich structure and fundamental importance .",
    "the algebraic geometry of the theory has been crucial to such deep insight as the holographic principle . indeed , in the ads / cft correspondence , wherein the gauge theory arises from the world - volume dynamics of branes , the space of vacua parameterizes precisely the bulk geometry , typically calabi - yau .",
    "this vacuum moduli space ( vms ) of gauge theories has itself been studied @xcite , and with the advances in computational commutative algebra , been subject to new scrutiny @xcite , uncovering perhaps unexpected signatures in such standard examples as the mssm @xcite or sqcd @xcite .",
    "a programme of enumerating operators in a supersymmetric gauge theory has recently been constructed , the methodology , dubbed the `` plethystic programme '' , harnesses the algebraic geometry of the classical vms , determined from certain flatness conditions once the lagrangian is known @xcite . interpreting the vacuum as prescribed by an ideal in a , possibly complicated , polynomial ring , the hilbert series and its plethystic exponentiation",
    "can then be regarded as grand canonical partition function which then encodes the chiral ring of operators of the gauge theory as a statistical - mechanical system .",
    "we are therefore naturally endowed with two implements of which we feel obliged to take advantage : ( 1 ) a wealth of experimental data in the form of catalogues of supersymmetric gauge theories , each of which engendering an algebraic variety , realized as the vms , and ( 2 ) an algorithmic framework within which the geometry of the vms is exploited for the sake of enumeration of the spectrum of bps operators and in which a fruitful dialogue between combinatorics and gauge theory is engaged",
    ". this concurrent inspiration , experimental and theoretical , in further accordance with the aforementioned skein of number theory already weaving herself into the tapestry of algebraic geometry arising from physics , shall suffice to serve as a beacon to our path .    and",
    "the path on which we are led will be as follows .",
    "we commence with a brief review in  [ s : rev ] , setting notation and laying the foundation , of the two chief protagonists .",
    "first , we outline how to obtain the moduli space of vacua , given the ( @xmath0 superspace ) lagrangian of an arbitrary supersymmetric gauge theory , by algorithmically recasting the f- and d - flatness conditions as a quotient of the space of ( mesonic ) gauge invariant operators ( gio ) by the jacobian ideal of the superpotential .",
    "the vms is then explicitly realized as an affine cone over a ( weighted ) projective variety .",
    "the geometry , and in particular the hilbert series of the vms and combinatorial functionals thereof , is then utilized in the enumeration of the gios via the syzygies .",
    "second , of the vast subject of algebraic varieties over finite number fields we touch upon some rudiments which will be of use .",
    "we emphasize on the construction of the local zeta function and the beautiful restriction of its rational form by the weil conjectures .",
    "then , forming the euler product over primes , we remind the reader of the arrival at the global hasse - weil zeta function and its dirichlet l - series expansion .",
    "thus armed , we march through a multitude of gauge theories in ",
    "[ s : eg ] , many of which are well - known , such as the free theory and sqcd .",
    "we will investigate these gauge theories under our new light , by finding the vms , which is then subject to plethystic analyses , some of which have already been investigated through the plethystic programme in the literature , but more importantly , to the reduction over finite fields .",
    "a host of zeta functions is then constructed for these field theories , and various properties , observed .",
    "fortified by our gaining experience on the two enumerative problems , one counting the syzygies and the other , zeros over number fields , one could not resist but to perceive them , both deeply rooted in gauge theory , in a unified outlook .",
    "we attempt , in  [ s : compare ] , to glimpse at this unifying principle , and show how one may proceed from one to the other , whereby establishing a curious duality between sets of gauge theories , with the geometric invariant properties of one controlling the arithmetic properties of another . in the case where the vms is dimension one and calabi - yau , _ viz .",
    "_ , the elliptic curve , this correspondence is very much in the spirit of the modularity theorem of taniyama - shimura - weil - wiles .",
    "we trudge on , in  [ s : asym ] , towards the asymptotic behaviour of the operators in the gauge theory , already an integral component of the plethystic programme , but now accompanied by this duality , and see once more how the emergence of the dirichlet series in governing the large r - charge and large @xmath1 trends in the physics . finally",
    ", we part with concluding remarks and prospects in  [ s : conc ] .",
    "let us begin with a rather pedagogical presentation of the two subjects which will be crucial to our ensuing investigations .",
    "the contrast and parallels between them will constitute the comparative study in which we shall engage .",
    "the first originates from supersymmetric gauge theories and the _ point dappui _ is the syzygies of the vacuum moduli space as an algebraic variety ; the second is key to arithmetical properties of algebraic varieties and whose foundations rest upon the hasse - weil zeta function .      given a gauge theory , one of the most fundamental tasks is the construction of its gauge invariant operators . in the case of supersymmetric gauge theories , especially those arising in the context of string theory , exhibiting as quiver gauge theories living on the world - volume of branes , due to the intrinsically geometrical nature of the situation , these operators are inextricably linked to the vacuum geometry of the theory .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories in @xmath2-dimensions on whose vacuum geometry we now briefly expound ; the analysis extends itself readily to higher supersymmetries in other dimensions .",
    "an @xmath0 ( global ) supersymmetric gauge theory is given by the action @xmath3 \\ , \\ ] ] with the @xmath4 variables parameterizing @xmath0 superspace over which we integrate .",
    "the @xmath5 are chiral superfields transforming in some representation @xmath6 of the gauge group @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is a vector superfield transforming in the lie algebra @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , the gauge field strength , is a chiral spinor superfield ; and @xmath11 is the superpotential , which is a holomorphic and typically polynomial , function of the @xmath5 . upon integrating over superspace",
    ", we obtain the scalar potential of the theory : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the scalar components of the chiral fields @xmath5 , and with @xmath14 being their charges . when the gauge group is abelian , one could , in addition , allow a fayet - illiopoulos ( fi ) term to the lagrangian : @xmath15 with fi parametre @xmath16 .",
    "the vacuum of the above theory is the minimum of the potential , which , being a sum of squares , occurs when each squared quantity vanishes : @xmath17 for supersymmetric theories , the ( classical ) vacuum , defined by the above flatness conditions for the f- and d - terms , is non - trivial , and is , in fact , an affine algebraic variety generically @xcite of greater than one complex dimension .",
    "therefore , there is a continuous moduli of vacua and this variety is commonly called the * vacuum moduli space * ( vms ) , @xmath18 .",
    "the solution space of the f - terms alone is also of significant interest and is known as the * master space * @xcite ( cf . review in @xcite ) .    whereas gives the explicit defining equation of @xmath18 , the standard geometrical approach is to construe the d - terms as gauge invariants , subject to the vanishing of the f - terms .",
    "more specifically , @xmath18 is a git quotient of d - terms by the f - terms @xcite .",
    "calculationally , one can establish a convenient algorithm @xcite , using the techniques of computational algebraic geometry , to interpret the d - term invariants as a polynomial ring map from the ideal defined by the f - terms , with its image the ideal defining @xmath18 in a convenient grbner basis .",
    "the procedure can be summarized succinctly as follows .    1 .",
    "let there be @xmath19 ( scalar - components of super-)fields @xmath20 and start with polynomial ring @xmath21 $ ] ; 2 .",
    "identify the obvious set of mesonic gios and find the generating set @xmath22 , consisting of @xmath23 gauge invariants ( the set of gios is always finitely generated ) ; this prescribes a ring map between two polynomial rings : @xmath21 \\stackrel{d}{\\longrightarrow } { \\mathbb{c}}[d_1 , \\ldots , d_k]$ ] ; 3 .   now incorporate superpotential @xmath24 , generically a polynomial in the fields @xmath13 and find its jacobian ideal of partial derivatives ( f - flatness ) : @xmath25 ; 4 .",
    "the vms is then explicitly the image of the ring map @xmath26 }        { \\ { f = \\langle f_1 , \\ldots , f_m \\rangle \\ } }      \\stackrel{d = gio}{\\longrightarrow }       { \\mathbb{c}}[d_1 , \\ldots , d_k ] ,      \\quad      { { \\cal m}}\\simeq { \\rm im}(d ) \\ .\\ ] ]    the algebro - geometric nature of the vms is especially pronounced in the context of string theory .",
    "when a single brane is placed transversely to a non - trivial back - ground , as in the ads / cft correspondence , a duality is established between the world - volume physics and the bulk supergravity . in particular , if a d3-brane is placed transverse to a local , affine calabi - yau three - fold singularity @xmath18 , filling the 10-dimensions of type iib , the world - volume is precisely a @xmath2-dimensional gauge theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry , product gauge group and bi - fundamental matter , encoded conveniently into a quiver . by construction , the mesonic ( _ i.e. _ , operators composed of direct contraction , involving no more than the kronecker delta tensor , of the chiral fields ) vms of this gauge theory , computed from , is exactly the calabi - yau three - fold @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath1 parallel coincident d3-branes are present , the vms , due to the permutation on the branes , simply becomes @xmath27 , the @xmath1-th symmetrized product of @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the complete spectrum of bps mesonic operators in the gauge theory .",
    "as mentioned above , the space of these objects , quotiented by the f - flat constraints , should give rise to the vms @xmath18 .",
    "these mesonic gauge invariant operators fall into two categories : single- and multi - trace .",
    "the former consists of words in the operators , with gauge - indices contracted but only a single overall trace and the latter , various products of the single - trace gauge invariants .",
    "we shall denote the generating function of the single - trace gauge invariants at @xmath1 branes ( or , equivalently , for @xmath28 matrices in the gauge theory ) as @xmath29 and that of the multi - trace invariants , @xmath30 ; then , the @xmath31-th coefficient in the series expansion would enumerate the corresponding gauge invariants , where @xmath31 is a natural level corresponding to , for example , the total r - charge of the gauge theory . using the algebraic geometry of @xmath18 to construct @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and hence to address",
    "the counting problem is the purpose of the so - called * plethystic programme * , developed in @xcite and furthered in @xcite . without much ado , let us briefly summarize the key points of this programme , referring the reader to details to _ loc .",
    "cit_.    * the quantity @xmath34 , counting the single - trace gauge invariants at large @xmath1 is equal to @xmath35 ; this is the _ point dappui _ of our construction .",
    "the level ( r - charge ) @xmath31 imposes a natural grading on the polynomial ring in which @xmath18 is an ideal and hence the generating function is the hilbert series of @xmath18 in the suitable affine cordinates embedded by the f- and d - terms : @xmath36 here , the coefficient @xmath37 is simultaneously the number of single - trace gauge invariants at total r - charge @xmath31 and the complex dimension of the @xmath31-graded piece of the cordinate ring prescribed by @xmath18 ; * for arbitrary @xmath1 , the relation between the single- and multi - trace gios are related by @xmath38 , \\quad g_{\\infty}(t ) = pe[g_1(t ) ] ; \\qquad g_{n}(t ) = pe[f_n(t)]\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] is the * plethystic exponential * functional defined as @xmath40 = \\exp\\left ( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{f(t^n ) -    f(0)}{n } \\right ) = \\frac{1}{\\prod\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty ( 1-t^n)^{a_n } } \\ ; \\ ] ] the structure of the infinite - product incarnation of this function should be reminiscent of the bosonic oscillator partition function ; * the plethystic exponentiation has an analytic inverse , called the plethystic logarithm and is given in terms of the number - theoretical mbius function @xmath41 : @xmath42 * the defining equation , or syzygy , of @xmath18 is given by @xmath43 , which can be readily obtained from the plethystic logarithm of the hilbert series : @xmath44 = \\mbox { defining equation of $ { { \\cal m}}$}.\\ ] ] when , in particular , @xmath18 is a complete intersection variety , @xmath45 is a terminating polynomial . * to obtain the counting for arbitrary @xmath1 , we promote @xmath39 $ ] to a parametre - inserted version and define the function @xmath46 dependent on the fugacity parametre @xmath47 .",
    "the series expansion of @xmath48 in @xmath47 gives @xmath49 , the multi - trace generating function at given @xmath1 , as its coefficients .",
    "the single - trace generating function @xmath50 is then retrieved as @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "we see , therefore , that the hilbert series , through the plethystic functions , links the algebraic geometry of @xmath18 and the enumeration of the gios , single- and multi - traced , of the @xmath0 gauge theory whose vms is @xmath18 .",
    "it is thus expedient to quickly remind the reader some key features of @xmath52 .",
    "it is important that the hilbert series is a _ rational function _ in @xmath53 and can be expressed in two ways : @xmath54 where @xmath23 is the dimension of the ambient affine space in which @xmath18 embeds . in either guise , the numerators @xmath55 and @xmath56 are polynomials with _ integer _ coefficients and",
    "@xmath57 is the degree of @xmath18 .",
    "the powers of the denominators are such that the leading pole captures the dimension of the embedding space and the manifold , respectively . when expanding the hilbert series into a taylor series , then , the coefficients have polynomial growth and is called the hilbert polynomial .",
    "we remark that for _ non - commutative _ graded rings and associated spaces , it is not necessary that the hilbert series be rational @xcite ; it would indeed be interesting to investigate such circumstances , especially since to d - brane gauge theories one should associate a non - commutative algebra , whose centre is the classical vms @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we remind the reader of some well - known results on algebraic varieties defined over finite fields . in particular",
    ", we shall address some basic principles of local zeta functions and the weil conjectures as well as global zeta function and their manifestation as l - functions .",
    "in due course , we will see expressions reminiscent of our plethystic functions discussed in the previous section .",
    "first , by a finite field we mean a number field with a finite number of elements ( cf .",
    "we are acquainted with @xmath58 ; this is simply the cyclic group of @xmath59 elements for some prime number @xmath59 ( called the * characteristic * of the field ) , with members represented by @xmath60 and the field axioms for addition , multiplication and division being the usual arithmetic modolo @xmath59 .",
    "less familiar are perhaps the finite ( galois ) extensions of this field , these are @xmath61 , consisting of @xmath62 elements for some positive integer @xmath63 .",
    "these elements can be explicitly constructed as follows .",
    "take the polynomial ring @xmath64 $ ] with coefficients in the field @xmath58 , and consider a monic irreducible polynomial @xmath65 of degree @xmath63 ; then the quotient ring , by the principal ideal @xmath66 @xmath64 / ( f(t))$ ] , is a field of @xmath62 elements .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath61 for various primes @xmath59 and positive integers @xmath63 are all the finite number fields .",
    "our main purpose is to consider an algebraic variety @xmath67 , defined not over the field @xmath68 of complex numbers , but , rather , over @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ , all indeterminates are to take values in these finite fields ( _ cf .",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ) . as such ,",
    "our usual notion of a variety now simply becomes a discrete set of points .",
    "an exponentiated generating function , can be formed for the number of points @xmath69 of @xmath67 over @xmath62 : @xmath70 this is dubbed the * local zeta function * of the variety @xmath67 for the prime @xmath59 because it is localized at a fixed prime .",
    "we can delocalize by taking the product of the above over all primes ( we will encounter so - called primes of good versus bad reduction later ) giving us the so - called * global * , or * hasse - weil * , zeta function : @xmath71 it is customary to apply the substitution @xmath72 to the above , for reasons which will soon become apparent in the ensuing examples , to which we now turn .    [ [ a - point ] ] a point : + + + + + + + + +    the simplest variety is a single point . in this case ,",
    "@xmath73 for all @xmath59 and all @xmath63 .",
    "whence , @xmath74 where , in the second line , we have used the standard euler product for the riemann zeta function .",
    "this illustrative example indeed should clarify the various names and substitutions stated above .",
    "[ [ the - projective - space - mathbbpk ] ] the projective space @xmath75 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for the case of the affine line @xmath76 over @xmath61 , there are clearly @xmath62 points ; the projectivization introduces a point at infinity , and hence @xmath77 , giving us @xmath78 the affine line itself would have simply given @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the generalization to @xmath75 over @xmath81 is straight - forward .",
    "recall that @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the non - zero elements in the field , totalling @xmath84 in number .",
    "thus , the number of points in @xmath75 is @xmath85 quotiented by @xmath84 , giving us @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath87 similarly , we have that , for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , giving us @xmath90      the euler product in , a key property for the riemann zeta function , is a general feature of the global zeta functions of our concern .",
    "indeed , one can develop an expansion of such products , into what is known as an * dirichlet series * ( sometimes called l - series for reasons which shall become clear later ) : @xmath91 where the product over primes is naturally converted to a sum over the integers .",
    "for the above example of a single point , the coefficients @xmath92 are simply all unity , the famous representation of @xmath93 .    some standard identities in the theory of dirichlet series ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) will be pertinent to us .",
    "the first is that , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 where we recall that @xmath96 is the sum over the @xmath97-th power of the divisors of @xmath31 .",
    "this is a special case of the so - called convolution property of dirichlet series , that @xmath98 with the convolution defined as @xmath99    in general , the coefficients of the l - series can be obtained by transform of mellin - type .",
    "this inversion is the so - called perron s formula and states that for @xmath100 , convergent when @xmath101 , @xmath102 for positive integer @xmath19 , @xmath103 an arbitrary real number such that @xmath104 .",
    "these partial sums can then be listed to iteratively obtain the individual terms desired .",
    "we also have a direct , though less computationally straight - forward inversion formula that @xmath105 finally , one could use an even more direct method of taking limits , wherever possible . indeed , writing , by setting @xmath106 so that as @xmath107 tends to 0 , @xmath108 tends to infinity , @xmath109 we have that @xmath110 , whence @xmath111 , and so on , successively , until order by order all the coefficients are obtained .",
    "the general structure of the local zeta function of the algebraic variety @xmath67 reflects , in a remarkably elegant fashion , the geometrical nature of @xmath67 .",
    "these are captured by what historically have come to be known as the * weil conjectures * ( 1940 s ) and proved by deligne in 1974 , using the @xmath112-adic cohomological techniques envisioned by grothendieck . in summary ,",
    "the statement is that for @xmath67 a ( non - singular ) @xmath19-dimensional complex projective algebraic variety ,    * the local zeta function @xmath113 is a rational function which can be more precisely written as alternating products in numerator and denominator : @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are all polynomials with integer coefficients , admitting factorization @xmath118 with @xmath119 being complex numbers with modulus @xmath120 .",
    "when @xmath121 , this means that all zeros of @xmath122 are at @xmath123 , an analogue of the riemann hypothesis .",
    "* a functional equation @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the euler number of @xmath67 , is obeyed . * for primes @xmath59 of good reduction ( that is , when the variety remains non - singular over @xmath81 , a point which we discuss in appendix [ a : reduction ] ) , the degree of @xmath126 is the @xmath127-th betti number of @xmath67 as a complex variety .",
    "having given a brief account of our two protagonists , it is now expedient to present , in relation thereto , some illustrative examples of gauge theories , their moduli spaces and associated arithmetic as well as geometric properties , as much as a warm - up , as a provision of a small catalogue against which one could initiate some systematic checks and experiments ( note that our approach is different from _",
    "e.g._@xcite to whose penetrating insights the reader is highly encouraged to refer ) .",
    "the simplest gauge theory is undoubtedly that of @xmath28 with a single free field @xmath67 charged therein , embodied as @xmath128 matrices .",
    "there is no superpotential and the gauge invariants are simply @xmath129 for @xmath130 , with any power @xmath131 re - writable , in terms of newton polynomials , in this fundamental generating set .",
    "when @xmath132 where no such matrix relations occur , we have that the moduli space is simply the affine complex line @xmath68 , generated by @xmath133 and the full specturm of operators are @xmath134 thus , the fundamental generating function is the hilbert series for @xmath68 ( cf .",
    " 7.1 of @xcite ) : @xmath135    the plethystic logarithm gives @xmath136 = f_1(t;{\\mathbb{c } } ) = t$ ] , signifying precisely the above : that the chiral ring is freely generated by a single element .",
    "the plethystic exponential is the euler eta - function @xmath137 , whose expansion encodes the ( free ) partition of integers and corresponds to the various ways the above single - trace operators can be multiplied . finally , the @xmath47-inserted plethystic exponential gives @xmath138 = \\frac{1-t^{n+1}}{1-t } \\ .\\ ] ] therefore , at fixed @xmath1 , the vms becomes the symmetric product @xmath139 , and the corresponding single- and multi - trace spectra are counted , respectively , by @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "strictly speaking , one should think of the vms as being the hilbert scheme of @xmath1-points on @xmath68 ( q.  v.  @xcite ) and plethystics for these are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the arithmetic properties of the above vmss are also readily computed .",
    "for @xmath68 , the local and global zeta functions were given in : @xmath142 for @xmath143 , the spaces become more involved , even though their hilbert series are neatly compacted into @xmath144 .",
    "let us begin with @xmath145 .",
    "here we have the affine variety described by @xmath146 acting on @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "the hilbert series is given by @xmath148^{-1}$ ] , signifying a freely generated algebra by two elements , of degrees 1 and 2 , respectively : these we see clearly as the invariants @xmath149 and @xmath150 under the exchange .",
    "the vms is therefore an affine cone over the weighted projective space @xmath151}$ ] .",
    "thus , other than the weighting of the cordinates , the variety is simply @xmath152 and no extra syzygies exist for our particular embedding .",
    "hence , the zeta functions are simply @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "this treatment generalizes to arbitrary @xmath1 , giving the vms as the affine cone over @xmath155}$ ] , isomorphic to @xmath156 , and having zeta functions as given in .",
    "parenthetically , the projectivization of the above is also interesting . adding a point at infinity gives @xmath157 , and the global zeta function , from , is the product @xmath158 .",
    "consequently , the l - series is @xmath159 where we have used .",
    "if we were to develop the power series with the l - series coefficients @xmath160 , we would have @xmath161 .",
    "this can be re - written @xcite as a so - called * lambert summation * , @xmath162 where the number theoretic divisor function becomes implicit .",
    "one of the most studied gauge theory in recent times is unquestionably the world - volume theory of @xmath1 parallel coincident d3-branes , especially in the context of holography and maldacena s ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the simplest setup is that of the d3-brane transverse to flat @xmath163 , considered as a real cone over @xmath164 , with near - horizon geometry of @xmath165 .",

    "luckily , because of the relative simplicity of the space , we can readily write down the invariants . let @xmath168 be the cordinates of @xmath163 ( this is not an abuse of notation , the three fields , after imposing the commuting f - terms , should correspond precisely to these affine cordinates ) , then our @xmath177 action takes these to , say @xmath178 , and we have the full 6 cordinates of @xmath179 . in degree one , the invariants are clearly @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 . in degree two , the invariants are the obvious @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , as well as @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 . since @xmath177 is a group of order 2 , by nther s theorem on invariants ,",
    "we need not look for higher invariants .",

    "this comparative study , relating one generation to another , would engender quite a peculiar relationship , wherein the bps mesonic spectrum of a gauge theory should correlate to the arithmetic of another vacuum geometry .",
    "two immediate hurdles , however , quickly present themselves were we to make a nave identification .",
    "first , the ( local ) zeta function , which is a rational function according to weil - deligne , is defined with respect to a given prime number @xmath59 ; the straight - forward analogue of this parametre in the case of the hilbert series is unclear .",
    "it seems unnatural that the bps spectrum should be at all particular to any fixed prime number .",
    "second , and perhaps more seriously , is the difference in the growth rate of @xmath37 , the number of gauge invariant operators versus that of @xmath345 , the number of zeros over @xmath346 .",
    "the former , being the hilbert series of an algebraic variety , usually tends polynomially in @xmath31 ( and indeed , governed by the so - called hilbert polynomial in the degree @xmath31 ) .",
    "the latter , however , grows rather much faster , and is in fact exponential in @xmath31 , say @xmath347 .",
    "this is not only seen in the examples presented in ",
    "[ s : zeta ] , but is , in fact , compelled to be thus by , so as to ensure that the generating zeta function can have the exponent behaving logarithmically , and consequently cancelling the exponential to give a rational function .",
    "for example , @xmath348 is a perfectly acceptable growth for a gauge theory .",
    "in fact , the mesonic spectrum of the d - brane theory on the flat - space @xmath152 , or equivalently , the hilbert series of the bi - variate polynomial ring @xmath147 $ ] , is simply @xmath349 ; whence @xmath350 .",
    "however , having @xmath351 would force the zeta function to be non - rational ; signifying that no algebraic variety over any number field could possibly have such a behaviour for its zeros .",
    "parenthetically , we point out that in an interesting paper @xcite , the authors find a fascinating relation between the hilbert series of a variety and the zeta function of another @xcite . there , the veronese curve @xmath67 prescribed by the embedding of @xmath157 by the very ample line bundle @xmath352 for some @xmath353 is considered .",
    "the dimension at degree @xmath31 is therefore @xmath354 , giving us the hilbert series : @xmath355 on the other hand , we recall that the zeta function for @xmath356 , given momentarily in the discussion on that of @xmath75 , is @xmath357 . we thus see that the numerator of the hilbert series of the veronese curve , evaluated at the negative of its argument , identifies with the denominator of the weil zeta function of the affine line , a seemingly different geometry . in this example , the aforementioned first objection was circumvented by the choice of the line bundle in embedding @xmath157 , whereby inherently introducing a parametre @xmath358 , which is then associated with some prime @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , one could consider the @xmath47-inserted plethytics for @xmath359 . here , as was computed in @xcite , @xmath360 , giving @xmath361 , and whence @xmath362 , with @xmath363 .",
    "this , with a simple re - definition , is of the form for the zeta function for @xmath75 in .",
    "these above digressions are , of course , merely formal resemblances .",
    "what we wish for is a systematic correspondence ; this is certainly encouraged by the similarity between the definitions of the zeta function and the plethystic exponential , a similarity whose discrepancies , however , are of sufficient significance that a direct identification is not pronouncedly manifest .",
    "nevertheless we are inspired by the following diagram : @xmath364    the diagram is self - suggestive and let us make a few remarks .",
    "the geometric object of concern is @xmath67 , the classical vms of a gauge theory .",
    "the syzygies @xmath365 , or defining equations of @xmath67 , is a polynomial in @xmath53 when @xmath67 is complete intersection , otherwise , it will be some power series .",
    "the plethystic exponential takes @xmath365 to the hilbert series @xmath366 , which counts the single - trace ( mesonic ) bps spectrum of the gauge theory and is a rational function by hilbert s theorem on algebraic varieties .",
    "the full ( mesonic ) spectrum is obtained by a second plethystic exponentiation , in the spirit of a bosonic oscillator partition function and recast as a product over the vibration modes , from @xmath366 .",
    "these multi - trace operators constitute the `` global '' , or complete , set of objects in the gauge theory , and is obtainable from two plethystic substitutions from the intrinsic geometric property @xmath365 of @xmath67 .    in a parallel vein",
    ", we can consider the arithmetic properties of @xmath67 and enumerate the number of solutions @xmath69 over finite fields .",
    "an exponential generating function gives the zeta function , which is rational by .",
    "this is made global by a product over primes and gives a hasse - weil zeta function , which can then be expanded into a dirichlet series .",
    "the plethystics have analytic inverses involving the mbius function while the inverse procedure to forming the zeta functions is quite difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the similarities of proceeding from intrinsic geometric ( or arithmetic ) properties of @xmath67 , via a rational function , to a global enumerative problem associated with the gauge theory , through two exponential ( infinite product ) substitutions in generating functions , is tantalizing indeed .",
    "let us commence again with examples .",
    "since the zeta function is severely restricted in form , it is perhaps expedient to start therewith .",
    "so our strategy will be to begin with a gauge theory whose vms is @xmath67 , we then compute the arithmetical properties of @xmath67 , starting from the bottom left box in the diagram in , trace the arrows , via rationality and globality , to the right and then go upwards , trace the arrows backwards , via locality and syzygy , to the geometrical properties of a possibly different vms @xmath367 of another gauge theory .",
    "let @xmath67 be a single point .",
    "we recall from that here the local zeta function is @xmath218 and the global zeta function is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the l - series coefficients @xmath92 are thus all unity .",
    "we then identify @xmath92 with the coefficients @xmath37 in the plethystic exponential , and can therefore form the power series @xmath368 , where we have added 1 as the zeroth term for normalization in order to take care of the @xmath369 term in the plethystic exponent .",
    "we have arrived , of course , at the hilbert series for @xmath68 , and subsequently the mesonic bps operators of d - branes probing this trivial calabi - yau 1-fold .",
    "the gauge theory corresponding to this vms , as we recall from  [ s:1field ] , is a free theory of a single field .",
    "thus , in our trivial warm - up example , we have gone from a point to @xmath68 , which can be thought of as a cone over a point .",
    "next , let us study the family of affine space @xmath88 ; this can be thought of as the vms of @xmath23 mutually commuting @xmath28 fields at large @xmath1 . from , we recall that @xmath370",
    ". therefore the dirichlet coefficients are @xmath371 .",
    "were this the enumerations of a hilbert series , we would have that ( again normalizing with 1 for the @xmath372 term ) : @xmath373 where @xmath374 is the standard ( de jonquire s ) poly - logarithm function . note the nomenclature here : we have used @xmath375 because the convention in the preceding discussion was that @xmath376 refers to the hilbert series of the algebraic variety @xmath67 whereas here we are formally constructing a power - series , the space for which @xmath377 may be a hilbert series is yet to be determined .",

    "@xcite for its implication in d - brane gauge theories ) .",
    "however , we see that the full hilbert series is palindromic only for odd @xmath23 .",

    "that we are dealing with affine spaces and that our gauge theory vmss are naturally _ affine _ varieties , it is perhaps more expedient of interpret the hilbert series as that of an affine variety .",
    "thus , we think of the geometry above as that of an affine cone over ( _ i.e. _ , the dehomogenization of ) the said elliptic curve .    the gauge theory is not immediately reconstructible .",
    "indeed , were the moduli space simply @xmath152 , then we would have , much in analogy with  [ s:1field ] , an @xmath28 theory with two adjoint fields at large @xmath1 , say @xmath392 and @xmath393 , such that the f - terms from the superpotential force them to commute and all the mesonic bps operators would be in the form @xmath394 with @xmath395 . however , the hilbert series would simply be @xmath396 , with trivial numerator .",
    "nevertheless , we see that @xmath389 is written in the form of a hilbert series of second kind .",
    "thus , the associated affine variety is of complex dimension 2 and of degree @xmath397 where @xmath398 is the numerator .",
    "this can geometrically be realized as a line in @xmath163 .",

    "it is curious that so rich a structure can be encoded in the zeta function of so simple a geometry as the affine complex line .",
    "moving on to higher @xmath23 gives more involved results : indeed , one can check that the plethystic logarithm of @xmath400 in are _ non - terminating_. this means that the corresponding algebraic varieties are not obviously complete intersections and there exist non - trivial higher syzygies _",
    "ad infinitum_. again , we can interpret the hilbert series as being of the second kind since the numerator and denominator have been cleared maximally .",
    "hence , @xmath23 corresponds to a variety of dimension @xmath401 and degree @xmath402 , following readily from the asymptotic expansion of the poly - logarithm , that @xmath403 where @xmath404 are the bernoulli numbers and the limit @xmath405 should be taken .",
    "let us focus , as inspired by string theory , on cases of @xmath406 , these being potentially theories on the d3 and m2-branes @xcite .",
    "taking the plethystic logarithm of the @xmath265 case gives @xmath407 =   t+3 t^2 + 5 t^3+t^4 - 6 t^5 - 17 t^6 - 4 t^7 + 29 t^8 + 56 t^9 + 7 t^{10 } + { { \\cal o}}(t^{11 } ) \\ .\\ ] ] indeed , as much as @xmath389 , whose expansion coefficients are @xmath31 , needs to be compared to @xmath152 , whose coefficients are @xmath408 , the present example , whose expansion coefficients are @xmath409 , needs to be compared to the _ conifold _ ( quadric hypersurface defined in @xmath199 ) , which has coefficients @xmath207 as was seen in .",
    "both latter cases are simple geometries whereas the former , by a seemingly trivial shift of 1 , already becomes quite involved . moreover , since the numerator is not palindromic , the space needs not even be calabi - yau . in any event , we know this to be a 3-dimensional variety of degree 2 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath280 , we have that @xmath410 =   t+7 t^2 + 19 t^3 + 9 t^4 - 72 t^5 - 246 t^6 - 72 t^7 + 1422 t^8+{{\\cal o}}\\left(t^{9}\\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] a non - complete intersection space of dimension 4 and degree 6 .",
    "therefore , in each case of @xmath23 , we could indeed find a vms of a rather non - trivial gauge theory whose hilbert series coincides with the zeta function of @xmath88 .",
    "the astute reader may have asked why , in the above example , in identifying the dirichlet coefficients from the euler product with plethystic product , we have set @xmath92 equal to @xmath37 , rather than @xmath411 ( adhering to the nomenclature of ) .",
    "the reason , of course , is that we wish to readily guarantee that we could arrive at an obvious rational function upon taking the plethystic logarithm . indeed , as we shall discuss in further detail in ",
    "[ s : asym ] , we need to be mindful of the growth rate of these coefficients . begotten from a hilbert series of commutative variety , @xmath37 are approximately polynomial growth , and whence , by plethystic exponentiation , @xmath411 grow as a polynomial multiplied by an exponential .    on the other hand , due to the work of schnee , landau and ramanujan on the general theories of dirichlet series ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath92 is usually taken to be of polynomial growth in order to allow absolute convergence of the dirichlet series in the upper half - plane and its subsequent analytic continuation - crucial , of course , for any statements pertaining to the generalized riemann hypothesis",
    ". therefore , identification of @xmath92 with @xmath37 is the more natural choice for now , as was seen above . indeed , for algebraic schemes more miscellaneous",
    ", the hilbert series can be arbitrary and whence more general identifications could be permissible .",
    "let us illustrate with the example of the conifold on which we expounded to some length above .",
    "we recall the dirichlet coefficients @xmath92 from and redevelop this as a power series ( without troubling ourselves too much with convergence presently ) . setting these to be the @xmath37 coefficients in a power series",
    ", we can then take the plethystic logarithm , at least order by order , to find that @xmath412 & = &   7 t-3 t^2 - 31 t^3 + 209 t^4 - 744 t^5 + 1431 t^6 + 2194 t^7 - 35726 t^8+\\\\ & & + 186120t^9 - 573070 t^{10}+{{\\cal o}}\\left(t^{11}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the rules , this would describe a non - complete - intersection manifold , generated by 7 linear forms , obeying 3 quadratic , 31 cubic relations , together with non - terminating higher syzygies .",
    "of course , nothing prevents us from going in direction converse to the above .",
    "we can compute the hilbert series for the geometry of a vms of a gauge theory whose syzygies encode the mesonic bps spectrum and then attempt to find another gauge theory whose zeta function has the same enumeration . in other words , we start from the upper left corner of the diagram in , trace to the right via plethystics , and then proceed contrariwise to the arrows in the bottom row , via localization to primes , and attempt to arrive at the vms of another gauge theory . in principle , we can proceed thence , forming another hilbert series and another vms , potentially _ ad nauseam_.    this latter direction of reconstructing the zeta function , at least computationally , is more difficult than the one reconstructing the hilbert series , because whereas plethystic exponentiation has an analytic inverse in terms of the mbius function , finding the factors in an euler product is not so immediate .",
    "first , one may ask why the above examples of elliptic curves and affine spaces worked so nicely .",
    "a key is the multiplicativity . in order that a dirichlet expansion be allowable in being developed into an euler product , as was hinted in ",
    "[ lseries ] , its coefficients @xmath92 in the series @xmath413 must be multiplicative ; that is , @xmath414 whenever @xmath19 and @xmath31 are coprime .",
    "this can be seen by explicitly writing out the euler product .",
    "note that this is a weaker condition from complete multiplicativity where this relation holds for all positive integers @xmath19 and @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "@xcite for multiplicativity in the context of enumerating d - brane orbifold theories ) .    in the case of affine space , the coefficients @xmath415 for some non - negative integer power @xmath23 , which is certainly completely multiplicative and whence we were able to expand @xmath416 .",
    "subsequently , this allows for the euler product over primes as @xmath417 , so that each of the factors is a rational function which can be then be interpreted as the zeta function of an algebraic variety .    of course , in order that @xmath92 also be conceivable as the dimensions of the graded pieces in a commutative ring in accord with the hilbert series and in addition to it being multiplicative , @xmath92 can only be such a pure monomial power . in other words , for example , the dirichlet series of @xmath418 for some integer @xmath419 can be performed without difficulty , even though the coefficients @xmath420 will not be multiplicative , whereby prohibiting an euler product with rational factors , and seems not amenable to an immediate arithmetic perspective .",
    "this rather severe restriction , that the coefficients be both polynomial , in accord with hilbert , and multiplicative , in accord with hasse - weil - dirichlet , should not discourage us .",
    "after all , for any gauge theory , especially those arising form branes at calabi - yau singularities , the entropy ( asymptotic growth rate ) of the bps operators is entirely determined by the leading behaviour of the hilbert polynomial which governs the hilbert series - a point to which we will return in the section on asymptotics .      nevertheless , examples still abound and let us continue with the train of thought prescribed above .",
    "we have found , in , that the zeta function for @xmath68 , or the affine cone over a single point , gave rise to a mysterious elliptic curve ( the cone over which is the vms of a gauge theory with two fields and constraints ) .",
    "thus , our starting point is the sextic curve at the upper left corner , giving us @xmath421 .",
    "we computed the plethystics in , but now let us compute the zeta function instead .",
    "the arithmetic of an elliptic curve @xmath422 is a vast subject .",

    "in particular , cusp forms of weight 2 and level 17 is generated by a single function , given as a plethystic type product , with @xmath529 the standard dedekind eta - function : @xmath530 as one can see , the coincidence of the two sets of expansion coefficients is highly non - trivial and constitutes one of the highlights of twentieth century mathematics .",
