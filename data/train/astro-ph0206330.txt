    "the new kind of neutron stars ( ns ) ; so - called anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are characterized by their rapid spin down @xmath0 $ ] . to explain this rapid spin - down , and the other characteristics of these objects such as the low rotational energy loss ,",
    "two fundamentally different models are proposed : accretion from a fall - back disk model and the magnetar model .",
    "accretion from a fall - back disk model describes these objects as systems with disks which have just finished the so - called propeller phase @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "however , it is shown that accretion from a fall - back disk model has too many difficulties in the explanation of axps @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "an expansion of this model might include the effect of propeller and accretion at the same time .",
    "such a model will be considerably successful in the explanation of properties of axps , but not sgrs @xmath2 $ ] .    to explain the strong gamma - ray bursts and the persistent x - ray radiation",
    ", it is proposed that the magnetic field of sgrs and axps decay in @xmath310@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 yr .",
    "moreover , the p - p values and the strength of the giant gamma ray bursts suggest very high magnetic fields for these objects . according to the magnetar model , axps and sgrs",
    "have magnetic fields of @xmath6 g @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "magnetar models are more attractive because they utilize new physical phenomena trying to explain the axp and sgr properties together simultaneously .",
    "since accretion theory is very well developed and well known , it is much easier to criticize the accretion models proposed for axps and sgrs .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers showing the problematic and good aspects of the magnetar model depending on the observational data .",
    "three axps are connected to supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xmath8 $ ] and one of the sgrs , namely sgr 0526 - 66 , is possibly genetically connected to snr n49 in the large magellanic cloud [ 6 ] .",
    "about 21 radio pulsars ( psrs ) are connected to galactic snrs @xmath9 $ ] with high probability .",
    "two of these axps ( axp 1e1841 - 045 and axp 1e2259 + 586 which are located in snrs g27.4 + 0.0 and g109.1 - 1.0 respectively ) are not farther than 7 kpc from the sun .",
    "observational data show that in that volume the number of snrs is not less than 100 .",
    "contrary to psrs , axps can be detected at such distances relatively easily . from the above arguments",
    ", it follows that the birth rate of axps is at least 50 times smaller than the birth rate of snrs .",
    "some recently found psrs have magnetic fields of b=@xmath10 g @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we do not yet know the properties of these psrs in detail , but young nss with b@xmath12 g ( having ages less than 10@xmath5 years ) in general , have very low x - ray luminosities and do not have @xmath13 ray burst activity . however , observed ns - magnetars always have l@xmath14 erg / s and they sometimes have strong @xmath13 ray burst properties . whether this statement about ns - magnetars is true in general",
    "is not known since number of data are few .",
    "axps and sgrs are distant objects .",
    "therefore it is very difficult to obtain trustworthy and sensitive enough observational data from these objects .",
    "this is also true for the snrs which might be genetically connected with them .",
    "moreover , the number of axps and sgrs are so small to perform statistical analysis .",
    "this situation can not considerably change in the future .",
    "the direct estimate of the magnetic field strength of these objects from cyclotron line detection is more important .",
    "it is such a pity that we do not yet detected such a cyclotron line .",
    "therefore for the investigation of origin and physical nature of these very important objects , it is necessary to study also neutron stars which demonstrate other types of properties .",
    "young radio pulsars ( psrs ) and single radio quiet neutron stars ( drqns ) which are observed as dim point x - ray sources will provide valuable information . in this paper we concentrate our attention on the timing properties of axps and sgrs . also , we want to understand the possible evolution of axps and sgrs on the p - p diagram , qualitatively .",
    "figures 1 - 7 which are constructed using the data in tables 1 - 7 display the period histories of axps and sgrs .",
    "we have investigated , how braking index of axps and sgrs change using these data .",
    "p of axp 1e2259 + 586 and axp 1841 - 045 had been constant for a long time from 1978 to 2000 and 1987 to 1999 respectively , as though braking index on the average were constant .",
    "average value of p for axp 1e2259 + 586 is @xmath35.4@xmath15 s / s . for axp 1e1841 - 045 average value of p",
    "is @xmath34.1@xmath16 s / s ( see figures 1 and 2 and tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "these objects are connected with snrs , so they are very young .",
    "deviation of observational values of periods from constant p line is related to noise , as well as observational errors .",
    "the absolute values of deviation of the period from constant p line for axp 1e2259 + 586 is not more than the deviation for axp 1e1841 - 045 ( we want to note that the deviation for axp 1e2259 + 586 seems to be more than the deviation for axp 1e1841 - 045 since the @xmath17 of the figures are not the same ) .",
    "braking of axp 1048.1 - 5937 , which is not connected with an snr , had sharply increased ( braking index has decreased ) between the years 1990 - 1998 .",
    "the braking of axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 from 1979 to 2000 changed considerably ( @xmath3 2 times ) . from 1979 to 1988 , from 1988 to 1994 and from 1996 to 2000 average values of p were about 1.6@xmath18 , 2.6@xmath16 , and 1.9@xmath16 s / s respectively .",
    "average value of p was roughly 3@xmath16 s / s for the 12 years period from 1988 to 2000 .",
    "from the fact that the average is higher than the values in the three intervals quoted above is a result of the period jump between 1994 - 1996 ( see figure 3 and table 3 ) .",
    "what is the reason for such huge changes of braking index ? as seen from figures 1 - 7 and tables 1 - 7 there are both sharp increase and decrease of periods of axps and sgrs .",
    "to change the period , moment of inertia must be changed due to burst or glitch and/or changing magnetic interaction with the surrounding matter during the bursts due to plasma ejection .",
    "if these drastic changes have connection with bursts in deep levels of the atmosphere , then axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 must have a high temperature . as seen from table 8",
    ", it has large but not the highest blackbody temperature in 0.1 - 2.4 kev band among all axps .",
    "its luminosity also is not the highest one in 2 - 10 kev band ( table 8) .",
    "this axp has the largest value of  , but also the largest value of deviation ( when scales of figures are taken into account ) from the constant p line among all the other axps , therefore stronger energetic processes must take place . in the frame of the magnetar model , it is difficult to understand the fact that axp1e1048.1 - 5937 does not have the largest temperature and luminosity .",
    "axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 like axp 1e2259 + 586 has been observed for 20 years , and axp 1e1841 - 045 has been observed since 1987 .",
    "however , no gamma ray burst have been detected from these objects .",
    "but these are distant objects and the observations may not be long enough .",
    "therefore , we may say that axp 1e1841 - 045 ( even though it has constant p ) and axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 will show burst properties in the future .",
    "braking of axp 4u0142 - 614 had increased in the years 1995 - 1998 ( see figure 4 and table 4 ) . for this axp average value of p between 1979 - 1993",

    "this probably have influence on the the period history and p. but for this axp , there are not enough period measurements ( see figure 5 and table 5 ) .",

    "from figure 5 we found p=2.98@xmath16 s / s . at the moment , it is difficult to talk about the character of period history for this source .",
    "the x - ray pulsations of axp j1845.0 - 0300 has been found in 1998 @xmath25 $ ] and after that no more period value is found for this source , so period change of this source can not be determined directly now . but with an indirect approach we can determine the lower limit for p as follows .",
    "this axp is connected with snr g29.6 + 0.1 which has age @xmath268@xmath27 years @xmath28 $ ] . equating the age of the snr to characteristic age @xmath29 and taking n=3 we estimate p@xmath301.3@xmath31 s / s .",
    "but if the magnetic field of this source is decaying then n@xmath303 .",
    "this lowers the value of p and increases @xmath29 .",
    "probably p value is about ( 1.3 - 2)@xmath31 s / s .",
    "we have used this value in the p - p diagram ( figure 8) .",
    "after three strong bursts in 1979 march 5 with intensities @xmath3(1 - 3.5)@xmath32 erg/@xmath33 s @xmath34 $ ] , sgr 1900 + 14 became active again after quiescence in 1992 with new strong bursts .",

    "in result of these bursts between 1998 may - 1999 march ( table 6 and figure 6 ) value of p considerably increased .",
    "it is very interesting that there were large increase in period also between 1999 march and 2001 february , because next burst occurred in 2001 april 18 @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the reasons might be the plasma ejection and interaction with the surrounding matter .",
    "this burst had an intensity of 1.1@xmath43 erg/@xmath33-s and a flux of 1.4@xmath32 erg/@xmath33-s .",
    "the total burst energy was @xmath37@xmath44 erg in 2001 july 2 @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "average value of p in the years from 1995 to 1999 is @xmath36 @xmath46 s / s and @xmath31.6 @xmath47 s / s for the years between 1998 - 2001 .",
    "the average value of p for the years between 1995 - 2001 is @xmath31 @xmath47 s / s . without any doubt for this sgr",
    ", p should fall to several times lower values in the future .",
    "sgr 1806 - 20 had been active between 1978 - 1987 and especially in 1983 @xmath48 $ ] when the peak flux was @xmath3010@xmath49 erg/@xmath33s @xmath50 $ ] . as seen from tables 9 and 7 and figure 7 , this sgr has several active periods between the years 1993 - 2001 .",
    "p of sgr1806 - 20 had been constant practically , between 1993 - 1999 , and equal to @xmath36 @xmath46 s / s . according to [ 29 ]",
    "the period had increased a little during the burst in 1999 january , 22 and after that it had decreased . according to [ 30 ] the energy for 1993 - 1999 bursts were @xmath310@xmath51 erg . in this period of time , we see the influence of these bursts on the period history , similar to the effect of bursts on the period history of sgr 1900 + 14 . from figure 7 , we see that p increases sharply after the 1999 burst activity . above , we have seen a similar behavior for sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "the instantaneous spin - down rate for sgr 1806 - 20 at a single epoch was higher by a factor of 1.5 than the global trend [ 29 ] . between the rxte measurement in may 1999 [ 29 ] and the chandra measurement in august 2000 [ 31 ] ,",
    "the average spin - down rate is a factor of 2 higher than the largest p previously measured for this source .",
    "several days before ( 2000 august 15 ) the chandra observation , there were moderate activity for sgr 1806 - 20 ; but this was too close to the chandra observation to have affected the spin period significantly . without any doubt the sharp increase of p of sgrs are related with burst activity .",
    "but as seen from period histories of sgrs , the the time - scale of increase of p and p values ( decrease of braking index ) are not more than 1 - 3 years .",
    "therefore , the process decreasing the braking index due to the ejected plasma finishes before the plasma reaches a distance @xmath26 1 pc from the ns .      magnetic decay can create noise in the period history of nss . magnetic decay in the long run decreases p and makes n@xmath303 .",
    "however , braking index is the result of all the processes that brake the star s rotation .",
    "of course , magnetic decay decreases the amount of magnetic dipole radiation but in this process other effects can increase braking .",
    "for example , ultra - relativistic particle winds decrease the value of n. increase in p was the highest for sgr 1900 + 14 ( during and after the 1998 bursts ) and sgr 1806 - 20 ( after the 1999 bursts ) .",
    "but what causes the strong and irregular change in periods for axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 , 4u0142 + 61 and possibly rxsj170849 - 4009 which are not located in snrs and do not have pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) ?    at birth , what brakes the rotation of the psr might not only be the magnetic dipole radiation but also something other than the magnetic - dipole radiation",
    ". then , the braking index of the psr can be different from 3 .",
    "the braking index of psrs being close to 3 shows that the dominant mechanism is the magnetic dipole radiation [ 13 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic times of different braking mechanisms are different so that we expect such situations :    \\1 .",
    "the characteristic times of period change in result of action of other mechanisms are shorter compared to that of magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the effects of such other mechanisms are not observable for newly born psrs that it is impossible to observe these effects for older psrs .",
    "assume that the characteristic time for the other mechanism is higher than that of magnetic dipole radiation for young psrs with strong magnetic fields .",
    "in this case the other mechanism can show itself in old psrs and in psrs with small magnetic fields ( effect of dipole is weak so that the effect of the other mechanism can be seen ) .",
    "evidently , any mechanism other than magnetic dipole radiation has much more noise than magnetic dipole radiation and braking index is different from 3 .",
    "on the other hand , since the rate of rotational energy loss decreases very fast , noise should increase as the period increases ( because the other mechanism produces noise ) .",
    "however , we see just the opposite for psrs .",
    "so if there exist some other mechanisms , they must show themselves only in young psrs and the characteristic times must be shorter than that of magnetic dipole radiation mechanism , because , only young psrs with large value of magnetic fields have braking index smaller than 3 and large values of noise for comparison with other psrs .",
    "this must be true for all types of single neutron stars ( sgrs , axps and drqnss ) .",
    "for axps and sgrs another braking mechanism exist and value of  is low , so there is large period noise . in the frame of the magnetar model ,",
    "existence of noise for axps shows that there are continuous magnetic decay and burst activity for axps .",
    "the psr with the least braking index is the vela psr ( psr j0835 - 4510 ) , n=1.4@xmath520.2 [ 33 ] .",
    "this is natural since this psr has the strongest glitches .",
    "of course smallness of n for vela psr is also related with its pwn .",
    "the braking index of psrs j0534 + 2200 , j0540 - 6919 ( which are not detected at 1400 mhz as belonging to magellanic cloud ) , j1513 - 5908 and j1119 - 6127 are respectively , 2.51@xmath520.01 [ 34 ] , 2.2@xmath520.1 [ 35 ] , 2.837@xmath520.001 [ 36 ] and 2.9@xmath520.05 [ 11 ] and all of them have characteristic ages @xmath53 years since these psrs have genetic connections with snrs .",
    "data about these psrs and snrs connected with them are given in table 10 .",
    "as seen from table 10 , braking index of psrs do not depend on the value of the pulsed radiation ( radiation related to curvature radiation ) and properties of nss .",
    "they depend on the amount of magnetic dipole radiation ( related to  ) ( the reasons that n is small are strong pwn and glitches ) .",
    "the evolution for radio psrs are on the average with n=3 and noise for radio psrs are very low ; so dominant mechanism is the magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "therefore magneto - dipole radiation in general determines the value of p and  .",
    "evidently , existence of pwn require additional rotational energy loss .",
    "the deviation of the value of the braking index from n=3 can not be determined by using only the size and the amount of radiation of pwn .",
    "but we see the dependence of these deviations on the morphological type of snrs and on the properties of pwn . in all cases when pwn exist , value of n@xmath263 .",
    "psrs with strong pwn in crab and n157b have small deviation of n from 3 than vela because of the strong glitches of the vela psr .",
    "naturally single nss without glitches , pwn , accretion or propeller must have n=3 in result of pure magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "axps and sgrs do not have strong pwn nor do they demonstrate glitches similar to vela pulsar ( with the exception axp rxsj170849 - 4009 , or we can not observe glitches as periods have large noises ) . moreover , if they are not accreting stars , then they must have in average braking index more than 3 because of magnetic field decay .",
    "but for sgrs and axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 we see considerable change of p and braking index .",
    "it shows that often the braking of nss which are related to other mechanisms may be larger than the effect of magneto - dipole radiation braking .",
    "therefore , often , the braking index may be @xmath263 also .",
    "axp 1e1048.1 - 5937 is similar to sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 according to their small l@xmath54/ values ( see figure 9 and table 8) and according to their location on the p - p diagram ( see figure 8) .",
    "these three objects have also large noise in period .",
    "the small value of the ratio l@xmath54/ is the result of the large value of  . in figure 9 ,",
    "also the l@xmath54/ values of drqnss given in table 11 , young psrs ( @xmath2610@xmath5 years ) radiating also in x - ray band , are shown [ 37 ] ( values of l@xmath54/ for these psrs are given in table 12 ) .",
    "also in this figure there are two old psrs , namely , psr j0826 + 2637 and psr j0953 + 0755 having ages of 5 10@xmath55 and 2 10@xmath56 years .",
    "there are also other psrs with similar ages having total x - ray radiation about 10@xmath57 erg / s . but drqns rxj0720.4 - 3125 have an x - ray luminosity of 1.7 10@xmath58 erg / s in 0.1 - 2.4 kev band at distance 0.3 kpc [ 38,39 ] .",

    "this value is several times larger than that of ordinary psrs with similar ages",

    "both of these snrs are shell type , similar to snrs which are connected with axps .",
    "these psrs and also axps do not have strong pwn which may be easily observed at 5 - 10 kpc distances .",
    "however , these psrs do not have large noise and they have low x - ray luminosity .",
    "this shows that , as we increase the magnetic field of normal psrs , x - ray luminosity do not increase nor do the noise .",
    "the non - increase of noise seems normal since  is high , but at least they should have a little higher noise than other psrs as they have closer magnetic fields to axps .",
    "all these show that continuous increase of magnetic field strength for single pulsars do not lead to axp properties continuously .",
    "there is the necessity to have another parameter which distinguish sgrs and axps from psrs , apart from the magnetic field strength",
    ". these parameter may be the mass of the ns - magnetars .    for understanding the physical nature of axps and sgrs",
    "it is very important to know their position on the p@xmath63p diagram and whether they have connection with snrs or not .",
    "these factors limit the age of axps and sgrs and give the foundation for discussion on their evolutionary tracks on the p@xmath63p diagram .",
    "sgrs do not show @xmath64 observable influence on the surrounding matter which may support such large value of p. therefore they must be magnetars and have age not more than axps if we do not consider accretion .",
    "negative result of snr search around these objects do not necessarily show that their ages are more than ( 2 - 5)@xmath65 years because we can not observe many snrs in strong star formation regions .",

    "it is necessary to have strong decay of magnetic fields and the initial magnetic field of this axp must not be smaller than that of sgrs. as sgrs and axps are located on the p@xmath63p diagram practically on a vertical line and there is no axps / sgrs with larger periods , we must talk about their evolution with very large value of braking index , n which might be caused by magnetic decay .",
    "it is strange not only we do not know such a decay among the psrs with large magnetic fields , but also the absence of bursts which we may observe in any radiation band [ 48 ] .",
    "drqns rxj0720.4 - 3125 , rxj0420.0 - 5022 and rxj0806.4 - 4123 are the continuations of evolutionary tracks of sgrs and axps on the p - p diagram with large value of n. these two sources do not have measured values of p ( see table 11 ) . but these sources are located very close , maybe d@xmath26 0.8 kpc and located in puppis - vela direction at high enough latitude , b. therefore absence of the snr which is connected with these sources puts lower limit for their age ; approximately 3 10@xmath4 years . from the known values of p and t@xmath303 10@xmath4 years , it follows that p for rxj0806.4 - 4123 and rxj0420.0 - 5020 respectively are smaller than 6 10@xmath66 s / s and 1.2 10@xmath67 s / s .",
    "these sources have kt@xmath30.06 - 0.09 kev and have thermal radiation luminosity @xmath310@xmath68 erg / s in 0.1 - 2.4 kev band ( see table 11 ) .",
    "therefore their ages must be small ; in this case they can not be result of evolution of ordinary radio psrs .",
    "if in reality sgrs and axps have evolution with very large braking index then these thermal sources may be the final stage of evolution of sgrs and have ages @xmath310@xmath5 years .",
    "such value of age do not contradict the cooling times of nss [ 49,50 ] .",
    "but if these sources appear in result of evolution of massive psrs with magnetic field about 10@xmath59 gauss then their ages must be @xmath3010@xmath55 years and their luminosity @xmath2610@xmath57 erg / s . but observed temperatures and luminosities of drqnss with large periods may be result of evolution of low mass ns with large magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , number density of drqnss with large p is high ; 4 objects at d@xmath260.8 kpc ( table 11 ) .",
    "therefore we can say that there is a large number of nss born with b@xmath3010@xmath59 gauss .",
    "but this and also the value of p ( which contain large error ) of rbs 1223 do not yet justify the magnetar model with ns mass about 1m@xmath69 .",
    "\\1 . the absolute deviations of period values from the constant p line in period histories are larger for sgr1900 + 14 , sgr1806 - 20 and axp1048.1 - 5937 which have the largest values of  in comparison to all other axps . in the frame of the magnetar model",
    ", these objects must also have large values of temperature and persistent luminosities since they have higher magnetic field decay .",
    "however , these sources do not have the largest temperature and luminosity among axps on the average .",
    "this is hard to understand in the frame of the magnetar model .",
    "moreover , we expect to see the same behavior of unobserved bursts and noise from axps 1e1841 - 045 and rxj170849 - 4009 similar to axp 1048.1 - 5937 , as the number of period data increase .",
    "if burst and noise characteristics are not observed from these axps , then this would be a handicap for the magnetar model .",
    "we estimated the lower limit of p value of axp j1845.0 - 0300 to be about 1.3 10@xmath66 s / s using the snr age as a constraint .",
    "the existence of magnetic decay decreases the upper limit of p. we conclude that p should be in the range between ( 1.3 - 2 ) 10@xmath66 s / s .",
    "the large increase in the p and p values of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 after the burst activity periods might be caused by plasma ejection and interaction with the surrounding matter .",
    "the time - scale of increase of p which is about 1 - 3 years for these two objects , shows that the process increasing the period finishes its effect when the ejected plasma reaches less than 1 pc from the ns .",
    "the high p values of these sgrs are expected to fall to lower values in the future .",
    "sgrs and axps are not sources having strong pwn in spite of the existence of bursts for sgrs and possible burst activity for axps .",
    "it is shown that pwn appears only if pulsar have small ages ( @xmath2610@xmath4 years ) and simultaneously very large value of  ( which is proportional to voltage ) .",
    "nearly all psrs with @xmath70 years up to distance 5 kpc were found to be associated with snrs .",
    "all 21 psrs which have connection with snrs , have values of @xmath303@xmath71 erg / s .",
    "but pwn have only been observed from 8 psrs which have @xmath72 years and @xmath73 erg / s . on the other hand , near the sgr1900 + 14 , sgr1806 - 20",
    ", axp1048.1 - 5937 and axpj170849 - 4009 with characteristic ages @xmath2610@xmath4 years and distances d@xmath2610 - 15 kpc even no s - type snrs are found . evidently , it is not easy to find snrs at such distances in the galactic center directions .",
    "but absence of pwn may be natural because for these objects @xmath264@xmath74 erg / s .",
    "\\5 . magnetar model considered sgrs and axps as one group of objects , so that axp 1e2259 + 586 must have lost burst activity and underwent considerable magnetic decay . if we equate the characteristic age of this axp to the age of snr ctb 109 , it is necessary for the initial magnetic field not to be smaller than the magnetic field of sgrs .",
    "from this fact and the location of sgrs and axps on the p - p diagram ( figure 8) roughly on a hypothetical vertical line ( p = const . )",
    "we may talk about strong magnetic field decay and large value of braking index for axp / sgr group .",
    "it is also necessary to note that if source of burst energy is the magnetic field decay and because several drqnss are in the continuation of the evolutionary tracks of axps / sgrs , then the decay of magnetic field of axps and sgrs must continue further . if the drqnss with large periods , are the continuation of axps / sgrs , then we expect to observe noise from these pulsars higher than the noise of radio psrs .",
    "also , we expect to observe high noise from newly found psrs which have magnetic fields closer to axp 1e2259 + 586 .    \\6 . in thompson & duncan [ 4 ] model of magnetar",
    ", the order of magnitude of the magnetic field is estimated from p - p values and also from the strength of the giant bursts .",
    "if these sources are involved in several bursts before , then they need to have several times higher magnetic field strength at birth than the current magnetic field strength or their magnetic field should be fed continuously by dynamo action .",
    "it is a possibility that the nss with sgr and axp properties might have lower mass ( so larger in radius ) and b@xmath310@xmath59 - 10@xmath75 g ) to have burst activity and such noise .",
    "this makes the drift of monopoles much easier , characteristic time for turbulence increases and consequently dynamo action works longer and magnetic field is fed longer .",
    "the ns with low mass perform pulsations for a long time until it comes to stability .",
    "this makes them cool later and increase the turbulence activity which feeds the dynamo .",
    "continuous increase of magnetic field for psrs do not lead to axp properties continuously . if in addition to the high magnetic fields we assume that the ns has lower mass , then , this causes p to decrease sharply when ns reaches stability .",
    "consequently the evolution from sgr to axp and then to drqns do not require strong magnetic decay . in this case",
    ", we can say that there is no fundamental difference between psrs and magnetars .",
