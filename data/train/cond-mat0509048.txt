    "ultra - cold alkaline atom gases have opened up new possibilities for experimentalists and theorists .",
    "the trapped atomic gases allow tuning of physical parameters and provide various kinds of systems from weak to strong coupling regimes .",
    "for example , commensurate filling bosonic systems can be constructed and mott transition has been one of attractive topics studied theoretically @xcite-@xcite and experimentally @xcite .    easy construction of low - dimensional systems is another advantage of the trapped atoms . in particular one - dimensional boson - fermion mixtures",
    "have attracted attention in terms of mixing - demixing transition , and theoretical studies have been reported @xcite-@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we carried out monte carlo simulations to investigate the mixing - demixing transition in a system at an incommensurate filling of fermions and boson , and found that the system undergoes the transition from the mixing to demixing phases as the boson - fermion interactions increase .",
    "figure 1 is a schematic phase diagram in the @xmath0 plane where @xmath1 is the fermion - boson interaction and @xmath2 the boson - boson interaction .",
    "the solid curve presents the phase boundary between the mixing and demixing phases .",
    "an exact solution assures the dashed straight line , @xmath3 , is in the mixing phase @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examined the mott transitions and the mixing - demixing transitions in systems at a commensurate filling on a one - dimensional periodic lattice .",
    "we know single - component commensurate systems become mott insulators as inter - particle interactions increase . in the two - component systems , however , the situation is rather complicated partly because the definition of the term `` commensurability '' has some variation .",
    "we could consider a case where the total filling is commensurate but the filling of each component is incommensurate ( case 1 ) , or a case where the total filling as well as the filling of each component are all commensurate ( case 2 ) .",
    "roth and burnett numerically studied a mixture of 4 fermions and 4 bosons on an 8-site lattice , i.e. the case 2 , and showed the presence of mixed mott insulator and demixed mott insulator at large fermion - boson interactions and large boson - boson interactions @xcite .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations to investigate the mott transition and the mixing - demixing transition in the case 1 and 2 and see how the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 changes in the commensurate - filling cases .",
    "we consider a mixture with @xmath4 spinless fermions and @xmath5 bosons on an @xmath6-site lattice . to let the system undergo the mott transition , we fixed the total number of particles @xmath7 equal to @xmath6 .",
    "we employed bose - fermi hubbard hamiltonian to describe the interacting particles : @xmath8",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\sum_i \\left [ \\frac{u_{bb}}{2 } n_{b , i}(n_{b , i}-1)+u_{fb}n_{f , i}n_{b , i } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively creation and annihilation operators for fermions ( @xmath11 ) or bosons ( @xmath12 ) on the @xmath13-th site , and @xmath14 .",
    "hopping energy and chemical potential are denoted respectively by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 are on - site boson - boson and fermion - boson repulsive interactions respectively .",
    "we set @xmath17 as an energy unit .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations with the world line algorithm to measure the system behavior @xcite .",
    "temperature was fixed to @xmath18 and the trotter decomposition number @xmath19 to 100 .",
    "the number of the sites @xmath6 was set to 14 and the total filling to 1 , i.e. @xmath20 . in the simulation of the case 1 we chose @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and in the simulation of the case 2 we used @xmath23 .    to observe the mixing - demixing transition , we measured a correlation function @xcite , @xmath24 which tends to be smaller , or negatively larger , in mixing states than in demixing states .",
    "to observe the mott transition , we measured a current - current correlation function @xmath25 in the zero - frequency limit @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 presents the total current density of fermions and bosons . @xmath25 becomes zero when the system is in the mott insulator phase .",
    "at first let us see some limiting cases . in the limit of @xmath28 ,",
    "i.e. in a hardcore boson case , the mixing - demixing transition was not observed and the system always stayed in the mixing state .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",
    "the fermion ( boson ) gains the kinetic energy by hopping to a boson- ( fermion- ) occupied site , and the gain should be larger in the mixing state than in the demixing state , because in the mixing state the fermions ( bosons ) have a lot of chances to hop to the site occupied by the boson ( fermion ) . in the limit of @xmath29 with a finite @xmath2 ,",
    "on the other hand , the system was always in the demixing state .",
    "what about the mott transition in these cases ? figure 2 shows the behavior of the correlation function @xmath25 with infinite boson - boson interactions ( a ) and that with infinite fermion - boson interactions ( b ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we investigated one - dimensional boson - fermion mixtures with one particle per site .",
    "focuses were placed on two cases . in the case 1 the fermion filling and boson filling are both incommensurate but the total filling is commensurate , and in the case 2 the fermion filling and boson filling are both commensurate .",
    "the monte carlo simulations revealed the occurrence of the mixing - demixing transition and the mott transition .",
    "the system showed the mixing - demixing transition at a certain value of @xmath1 and the transition point shifted to the larger @xmath1 side as @xmath2 increases , which was qualitatively similar to the incommensurate filling case @xcite .",
    "we found the mott transition occurred in both mixing and demixing phases at a sufficiently large interaction .",
    "the phase diagrams of the case 1 and 2 were obtained and clearly exhibited the presence of the mixed mott insulator and the demixed mott insulator .",
