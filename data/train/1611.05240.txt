    "quantum field theory ( qft ) was originally developed as a quantum theory of physical systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "perhaps the simplest example is obtained from the wave equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in its first order form",
    "@xmath3 it is an infinite dimensional hamiltonian system on the phase space of suitable functions @xmath4 . in quantum theory",
    "the field @xmath1 becomes an operator valued distribution i.e. the smeared fields @xmath5 with @xmath6 act as ( unbounded ) operators in a hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "the physical content of this qft is summarized by the the _ wightman functions _ @xmath8 where we denoted @xmath9 by @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a special vector ( `` vacuum '' ) .",
    "the wightman functions are distributions , @xmath12 and more generally , an axiomatic characterization of qft can be given in terms of such distributions @xcite .",
    "in this formulation there is nothing random about qft .",
    "however , it was later realized that the wightman functions @xmath13 are boundary values of analytic functions in complex @xmath14 and they have in particular an analytic continuation to the _ euclidean _ region of imaginary time , leading to _ schwinger functions _ @xmath15 the schwinger functions have a probabilistic interpretation as correlation functions of a _ random field _",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 ( modulo a regularity assumption guaranteeing solution of a moment problem ) : @xmath18 in our simple example of quantization of the wave equation the resulting random field is the _ gaussian free field _ ( gff ) , a gaussian random distribution with covariance operator given by the green function of the laplace operator in @xmath19 .",
    "conversely osterwalder and schrader @xcite showed that one can also do the opposite : starting from the schwinger functions one can reconstruct the wightman functions provided the former satisfy a positivity condition called reflection positivity . in this sense the subject of qft can be viewed as a special case of that of random fields .",
    "in fact , this reconstruction of the qft plays very little role in the major physical application of reflection positive random fields namely the theory of critical phenomena . here",
    "the physics takes place in the euclidean region and the coordinate corresponding to the ( imaginary ) time above is a spatial variable .",
    "examples are condensed matter systems which exhibit scale invariance at second order phase transition points .",
    "this scale invariance is _ universal _ i.e. independent on most microscopic details and it described by euclidean qft s .",
    "of course in qft one is not interested in the free field but one with interactions . in our wave equation example interactions",
    "enter as nonlinear terms in the equation .",
    "the resulting random fields are _ non - gaussian _ and the goal of _ constructive field theory _ is to give examples of such fields satisfying the os axioms . in the context of critical phenomena",
    "the statistics of the fields at the phase transition point are strongly nongaussian in the interesting cases and the scaling properties of the correlation functions differ radically from that of a gaussian theory .",
    "the construction of such non - gaussian random fields is by no means easy .",
    "for example if we add a simple nonlinear term @xmath20 to the wave equation then for all @xmath21 one needs to perform a _ renormalization _",
    ": the equation has to be regularized by smoothening it on scale @xmath22 and renormalized by adding terms blowing up as @xmath23 . the way to understand this and to find the renormalizations",
    "was conceived first by physicists in the 40 s studying the qft in a formal perturbation expansion in the nonlinearity and conceptualized by k. wilson in the 60 s @xcite in the theory of renormalization group .",
    "another vast field where ideas from qft have proved to be very useful deals with _",
    "noisy dynamics_. stationary states of markov processes with infinite dimensional state space give rise to qft - like random fields .",
    "examples are nonlinear stochastic pde s driven by space - time white noise and scaling limits of interacting particle systems .",
    "these stationary states are usually not os - positive but nevertheless share many features of qft s , in particular the problem of renormalization .    in this presentation",
    "i will discuss two examples of interaction between qft and probability .",
    "the first deals with nonlinear parabolic pde s driven by a very rough noise .",
    "these equations require renormalization in order to be well posed and qft ideas are very useful in understanding of this .",
    "the second example is from constructive qft : i will discuss how ideas from the probabilistic theory of multiplicative chaos can be used to construct an interesting conformal field theory , the liouville theory which is conjectured to be a basic building block of two dimensional quantum gravity or in other words the scaling limit of discrete two dimensional random surfaces .",
    "nonlinear parabolic pde s driven by a space time decorrelated noise are ubiquitous in physics .",
    "these equations are of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is defined on @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a function of @xmath28 and possibly its derivatives which can also be non - local and @xmath29 is white noise on @xmath30 , formally @xmath31 examples are the kpz equation with @xmath32 and @xmath33 describing random deposition in surface growth and the ginzburg - landau model @xmath34 describing stochastic dynamics of spin systems . usually in these problems one is interested in the behavior of solutions in large time and/or long distances in space . in particular",
    "one is interested in stationary states and their scaling properties .",
    "these can be studied with regularized versions of the equations where the noise is replaced by a mollified version that is smooth in small scales .",
    "often one expects that the large scale behavior is insensitive to such regularization .    from the mathematical point of view and sometimes also from the physical one it is of interest to inquire about the short distance properties i.e. about the well - posedness of the equations without regularizations .",
    "then one is encountering the problem that the solutions are expected to have very weak regularity , they are distributions , and it is not clear how to set up the solution theory for the nonlinear equations in distribution spaces .",
    "recently this problem was addressed by martin hairer who set up a solution theory for a class of such equations , including the kpz equation and the gl equation in three dimensions .",
    "the latter case was also addressed by catellier and chouk @xcite based on the theory of paracontrolled distributions developed in @xcite .",
    "i will discuss an alternative approach @xcite to this problem based on wilson s rg ideas developed originally in qft .",
    "to see what the problem with equations is consider first the linear case @xmath35 .",
    "we take the spatial domain to be the unit torus @xmath36 .",
    "the solution with initial data @xmath37 is then given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 and we denote the heat semigroup by @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is a random field with covariance @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the integral kernel of the operator @xmath44 so @xmath45 becomes the gff as @xmath46 .",
    "in particular @xmath43 is singular in short scales : @xmath47    let now @xmath48 and write as an integral equation ( take @xmath49 ) @xmath50 where @xmath41 is the solution to the linear equation .",
    "fix a realization of the random field @xmath41 and try to solve this fixed point problem by picard iteration@xmath51 this fails : for the kpz equation @xmath52 is not defined as @xmath45 has the regularity of brownian motion in @xmath53 . for the gl equation @xmath54 and by this is not defined as a random filed as @xmath55 .",
    "such divergencies are familiar from qft .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath56 case the equation has a stationary measure @xmath57 ( obtained as @xmath46 from ) which is the gaussian free field corresponding to the quantization of the linear wave equation discussed in section [ intro ] .",
    "formally the gl equation then has a stationary measure @xmath58 ( d)=e^-_^d(x)^4dx_gff(d ) .",
    "@xmath58 this is precisely the euclidean qft measure corresponding to the quantization of the nonlinear wave equation . since @xmath59 is not a well defined random variable in @xmath60 to define this measure one needs renormalization .",
    "first we regularize @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a smooth mollifier and then renormalize by adding a _ counter term _",
    "@xmath63 then @xmath58 _ 0e^-_u^()(_(x))dx_gff(d ) @xmath58 exists provided we take @xmath64 with suitable @xmath65 .",
    "construction of this limit was a major accomplishment of constructive field theory in the 1970 s ( for references see @xcite ) .",
    "let us take the same approach to the equation by considering a regularized version : @xmath66 with mollified noise @xmath67 and renormalized @xmath68 which has @xmath22-dependent terms added to @xmath69 .",
    "the noise @xmath70 is a.s .",
    "smooth so is well posed with a.s .",
    "smooth solution @xmath71 .",
    "our task is to determine @xmath68 so that @xmath71 converges as @xmath23 to some distribution @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the gl and the kpz equations and the following generalization of the kpz equation which shows up in fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite and turns out to be instructive : @xmath72 where the field @xmath73 takes values in @xmath74 and the coefficients @xmath75 may be quite general . for this equation",
    "we take a constant counter term @xmath76 and for the gl equation we take the counter term @xmath77 with @xmath78 given by . then    there exist constants @xmath79 s.t .",
    "the following holds almost surely in @xmath29 : there exists @xmath80 s.t .",
    "the regularized equation has a unique solution @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83\\times { \\mathbb{t}}^d)\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is independent of the cutoff function @xmath62 .",
    "we remark that in general @xmath84 but for the kpz case it vanishes .",
    "the fixed point problem related to is @xmath85 for @xmath86 this problem has smooth solution @xmath87 at least for some time since the noise is a.s .",
    "smooth . however , since the limit @xmath28 will be a distribution its not clear how to set this up as a banach fixed point problem the approach in @xcite is to develop a nonlinear theory of distributions allowing to formulate and solve the fixed point problem .",
    "this can be compared to perturbative renormalization theory in qft .",
    "our approach uses another approach to renormalization pioneered by k. wilson in the 60 s @xcite . in wilson s approach adapted to the spde one would not try to solve equation , call it @xmath88 , directly but rather go scale by scale starting from the scale @xmath89 and deriving _ effective _ equations @xmath90 for larger scales @xmath91 , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is arbitrary .",
    "going from scale @xmath94 to @xmath95 is a problem with @xmath96 cutoff when transformed to dimensionless variables .",
    "this problem can be studied by a standard banach fixed point method .",
    "the possible singularities of the original problem are present in the large @xmath97 behavior of the corresponding effective equation .",
    "one views @xmath98 as a dynamical system and attempts to find an initial condition at @xmath99 i.e. modify @xmath88 so that if we fix the scale @xmath100 and then let @xmath101 ( and as a consequence @xmath102 ) the effective equation at scale @xmath103 has a limit .",
    "it turns out that controlling this limit for the effective equations allows one then to control the solution to the original equation .    in this approach no new theory of distributions needed and it provides a general method to derive counterterms for subcritical nonlinearities as well as a general method to study _",
    "universality_.      for simplicity of exposition we will use a regularization in time instead of space in the fixed point problem : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is smooth , vanishing in a neighborhood of @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "this cutoff has the same effect as the mollification i.e. regularizing the problem in spatial scales @xmath109",
    ".    it will be useful to introduce _ dimensionless variables _ in terms of which the cutoff @xmath110 .",
    "define a space time scaling operation @xmath111 by @xmath112 this scaling preserves the linear equation @xmath113 .",
    "we will now set @xmath114 then the kpz and gl nonlinear terms @xmath115 become @xmath116 and the fixed point problem becomes @xmath117 in this dimensionless formulation the equation has cutoff on unit scale ( instead of scale @xmath22 ) and the nonlinearity is small if @xmath118 ( kpz ) , @xmath119 ( gl ) .",
    "these are the _ subcritical _ cases .",
    "however , @xmath120 is now defined on @xmath121\\times({{\\epsilon}}^{-1}{\\mathbb{t}})^d$ ] i.e. we need to control _ arbitrary large times and volumes _ as @xmath101 ( we denote the noise in again by @xmath29 : it equals in law the space time white noise on @xmath121\\times({{\\epsilon}}^{-1}{\\mathbb{t}})^d$ ] ) .",

    "the remaining expectation over the gff can be dealt with a shift of @xmath368 to dispose of @xmath369 .",
    "the result is after some calculation ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath370 where @xmath371 the modulus of continuity of the chaos measure is @xmath372 for any @xmath373 .",
    "this leads to integrability of @xmath374 if @xmath375 for all @xmath376 and    @xmath377 if and only if @xmath365 and @xmath375 .",
    "these bounds for @xmath378 are called _",

    "we obtain @xmath384 where @xmath385 i.e. under @xmath386 the law of @xmath387 is @xmath388 . which agrees with the result in random surfaces .",
    "the emphasis of kpz was actually on correlation functions of conformal field theories on random surfaces .",

    "so far we have motivated the liouville model through its conjectural relationship to scaling limits of random triangulations . however",
    ", the liouville model is also an interesting _ conformal field theory _ by itself .",
    "this way of looking we view the vertex operators as ( euclidean ) quantum fields .",

    "second , the liouville model has also _ local conformal symmetry_. in cft this derives from the _ energy - momentum tensor _ which encodes the variations of the theory with respect to the background metric .",
    "more specifically , one may define the the correlation functions in a smooth riemannian metric near our @xmath404 and consider the one parameter family @xmath405 where @xmath290 is a smooth function with support in @xmath406 .",
    "then ( a component of ) the stress tensor @xmath407 is defined by the following formula in the physics literature ( see @xcite ) @xmath408 a simple formal computation then yields the following heuristic formula @xmath409 where @xmath28 is the liouville field . in the same way , perturbing the metric instead by @xmath410 yields the field @xmath411 .",
    "@xmath407 encodes local conformal symmetries through the _ conformal ward",

    "the conjugate field @xmath446 gives rise to another copy of the virasoro algebra .",
    "a major challenge is to study the reduction of this representation to irreducibles . it is conjectured @xcite that @xmath7 decomposes to a direct integral @xmath447 where @xmath448 is a highest weight module for the two algebras with @xmath449 and similarly for @xmath450 .",
