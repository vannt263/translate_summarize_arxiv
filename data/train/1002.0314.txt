    "for over a century , maxwell s demon has provided a setting in which to address the limitations that thermodynamics places on an observer free to perform measurements on a system and then act on their acquired information in some algorithmic way @xcite .",
    "as is now well appreciated , information has an energetic value .",
    "a demonmones _ meaning _ ` one who has knowledge or wisdom'_. ] in possession of information about a physical state may transform this information into mechanical work @xcite . specifically , given a system of dimension @xmath0 in a state @xmath1 and the presence of a reservoir at a temperature @xmath2 , the demon can extract @xmath3)$ ] amount of mechanical work from the reservoir , where @xmath4=-\\tr [ \\rho \\log \\rho]$ ] is the von neumann entropy of the state .",
    "the demon fails in his attempt to violate the second law of thermodynamics because the demon s memory , where he records the measurement results of the state , must be erased in order to operate in a cycle @xcite .",
    "such an erasure of memory can only occur with an unavoidable dissipation of heat @xcite .    as a concrete example",
    ", we may consider a gas of @xmath5 particles that resides in a piston on one side of a movable partition and in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at a temperature @xmath2 , fig .",
    "[ piston1 ] .",
    "the demon , upon discovering what side of the partition the gas is on , may extract usable energy by deterministically acting on the piston system - if the gas is to the left of the partition , the demon puts the piston in contact with the reservoir , loads the partition with a mass @xmath6 , tilts the piston as in fig .  [ piston1 ] and allows the gas to expand slowly through the available empty volume .",
    "the expansion of the gas does work on the mass , elevating to a height @xmath7 , which makes mechanical energy available .",
    "indeed the expansion can provide a maximum mechanical energy of @xmath8 , which is extracted from the thermal reservoir .      in order to illustrate the new possibilities that quantum entanglement can bring to the story",
    ", it is amusing to consider cases in which a `` global demon '' , with access to a large entangled quantum state , can confuse the traditional `` local demon '' who can only measure and act locally .",
    "the global demon can arrange that any thermodynamic process for the local demon can run `` backwards '' - heat can flow from a cold to hot and gases can contract instead of expand - driven by entanglement present in the state .    as a concrete example",
    ", consider a system that consists of a reservoir and piston that are both in local thermal states , but with the global state of the system being pure .",
    "this state is prepared by the global demon , who may manipulate the global state as he pleases .",
    "the global demon ensures that the entanglement is local , in the sense that any part of the total system is entangled with its surroundings .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we constrain the reservoir subsystems to couple to each other much weaker than to the piston subsystem .",
    "this situation is indicated in fig .",
    "[ piston1 ] .    since thermality arises from entanglement between the different components of the system in a global pure state , when the local demon places the piston in contact with the quantum reservoir and releases the partition , instead of the gas expanding up the piston to fill the empty volume , the thermal state repeatedly expands forwards and then contracts backwards in the tube as energy flows into and out of the piston . the spontaneous contraction phase of the gas is identical to the usual spontaneous expansion of a gas but with time `` running backwards '' .",
    "for the local demon , the thermodynamic arrow of time has failed and he is unable to extract any net work despite having been given a piston that is on its own completely indistinguishable from a standard thermal state on one side of a partition , seemingly coupled to a standard thermal reservoir .",
    "the mischievous global demon , however , may further confuse the local demon by thermalizing the entanglement in the ( quantum ) reservoir that he has access to , using a different ( fully thermal , classical ) reservoir .",
    "since the full system of dimension @xmath0 is in a pure state , the global demon can extract @xmath9 amount of work from the classical reservoir , which he may store as mechanical energy , leaving the quantum reservoir plus piston in a maximally mixed state . then using only some of this mechanical energy he may convert the maximally mixed reservoir into a true thermal state at the original temperature @xmath2 . at which point the thermodynamic arrow is returned , the global demon has converted the entanglement into mechanical energy and the local demon , unaware of all the entanglement that was present , will finally be able to extract @xmath10 of work from the reservoir as he had originally hoped .    .",

    "mechanical energy is extracted from the reservoir by the demon choosing which way to tilt the piston , conditional on his information about what side the gas is located.,title=\"fig:\",width=75 ]          there are many reasons to be interested in the arrow of time beyond simply fun stories about demons .",
    "the standard thermodynamic arrow applies to systems that are in isolation and amounts to a directionality for certain physical processes .",
    "the curious fact that certain processes are forbidden and certain states inaccessible is generally traced back to the initial conditions of the physical system . furthermore , since all parts of the observed universe seem to obey a common `` arrow of time '' , the problem of resolving the thermodynamic arrow s origin requires us to account for the particular initial conditions of our universe @xcite .",
    "the notion of an `` arrow of time '' is quite broad - extending from the uniform large - scale expansion of the universe , to the radiative arrow , and through to the individual , psychological perception of time @xcite .",
    "however , since the laws of physics are invariant under time reversal ( strictly cpt invariant ) , it is believed that any form of temporal directionality will stem ultimately from the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "recent work by partovi @xcite has considered a specific pure entangled state that produced heat flow from a cold body to a hotter one , contrary to the usual thermodynamic arrow . in @xcite partovi identifies the large degree of entanglement present in the state as being responsible for this unusual behaviour .",
    "we will see , in fact , that the negative heat flow he considers does not necessarily depend on the presence of entanglement in the state and , by adopting an information theoretic framework , we explore these and similar possibilities as a way of elucidating the properties of entangled quantum states and the connection with varied notions of `` arrows of time '' .",
    "a paradigmatic setting that captures the essentials of the thermodynamic arrow of time is in the context of heat flow between two systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 that interact in isolation , so that their total energy is constant . for simplicity , we assume that they do no mechanical work on each other , but may exchange energy in the form of heat , for which conservation of energy implies that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the heat acquired by @xmath11 and @xmath15 is the heat acquired by @xmath12 .    ultimately , the key ingredient that dictates which states are accessible via the set of all interactions on the total state @xmath16 is the degree of correlations initially present between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these correlations between the two subsystems are quantified by the _ mutual information _ , which is non - negative for all states and defined in terms of relative entropy as @xmath17=s_a+s_b -s_{ab}$ ] , where , for example , @xmath18 $ ] is the von neumann entropy for the state @xmath19 .",
    "the mutual information is a convenient measure of how distinguishable the state @xmath16 is from the completely uncorrelated product state @xmath20 .    of particular interest",
    "is when the reduced states at the initial time @xmath21 of subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 are thermal states for their respective individual hamiltonians , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . given temperatures @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the reduced states then take the form @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 for subsystem @xmath29 .",
    "we may consider the most general process of switching on time - dependent interactions @xmath30 between @xmath11 and @xmath12 that evolve the composite system into a new state @xmath31 .",
    "for subsystem @xmath29 at a later time @xmath32 , the two thermodynamic variables of central interest are the average energy @xmath33 $ ] and the entropy @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "locally at @xmath11 the interaction results in the transformation @xmath35 $ ] , and so @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with similar expressions for @xmath12 .",
    "these changes in local thermodynamic variables are constrained by the fact that a thermal state @xmath38/\\tr[\\exp[-\\beta h]]$ ] minimizes the free energy function @xmath39 = \\tr [ \\rho h ] - s[\\rho]/\\beta$ ] .",
    "consequently we have that @xmath40 - s[\\rho(t_i)]/\\beta<\\tr [ \\rho(t_f ) h ] - s[\\rho(t_f)]/\\beta$ ] , which more explicitly yields @xmath41 for the change in the thermodynamic variables defined at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it must be emphasized that equations ( [ freee ] ) are kinematical restrictions on _ any _ transformation from initially thermal states , @xmath42 } , to any other pair of local states @xmath43 .",
    "we consider transformations on the composite system that satisfy @xmath44 = s[\\rho_{ab}(t_f)]$ ] ( which includes unitary transformations ) and so @xmath45 .",
    "the only other restriction that we place on the transformation is that @xmath46=\\tr [ \\rho_{ab } ( t_f ) ( h_a+h_b)]$ ] .",
    "since we do nt consider mechanical work , this amounts to requiring that there is zero net heat flow into the composite system , and the total energy before the interaction process equals the total energy afterwards . writing @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the heat gained by @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , we obtain for these energy preserving processes that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the change in the mutual information between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the special initial state @xmath51 in which correlations vanish was historically called the condition of _ stosszahlansatz _ , or ` molecular chaos ' .",
    "if we consider @xmath11 and @xmath12 initially uncorrelated at some time @xmath21 then @xmath52 , however interactions allow correlations to form between the two subsystems , and so at later times @xmath53 we have @xmath54 . we immediately deduce that @xmath55 , or more explicitly in terms of temperature @xmath56 in other words , heat can only flow from hot thermal states to cold thermal states in isolation .",
    "this is the standard thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "this situation can be generalized to @xmath5 initially uncorrelated thermal states and provides us with the constraint @xmath57 which forbids certain types of heat flow ; for example , if we partition the @xmath5 thermal states in two , such that all the temperatures in the first group are lower than those in the second , then it is impossible for heat to flow from the first to the second .    in general",
    ", however , initial correlations are expected to be present , @xmath58 , and so the change in mutual information can be negative . from ( [ flow ] ) it is clear that there is no longer a constraint on the directionality of heat flow between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . as we shall now see , the correlations that make up the total mutual information can arise from classical correlations , or from a combination of classical correlations and quantum entanglement .",
    "entangled quantum systems can possess far stronger correlations than are possible classically , and in fact the vast majority of quantum states are entangled @xcite .",
    "work has been done previously on how quantum correlations affect macroscopic thermodynamic observables such as the susceptibility or the heat capacity , and it has been shown that measurement of these macroscopic observables can act as entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the thermodynamic _ transformations _ themselves also constitute entanglement witnesses",
    ". we should be careful to distinguish this research program from the one to do with with formal analogies @xcite between irreversible entanglement transformations and the second law of thermodynamics , on which much progress has recently been made @xcite , or from attempts to connect the second law of thermodynamics to bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the physical effects which entanglement between systems and reservoirs has on the thermodynamical transformations of the systems .    recently in @xcite partovi considered how the presence of entanglement in a system affects irreversible thermodynamic transformations .",
    "the intriguing scenario he considered involves two subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 that are overall in a pure state @xmath59 and possess strong quantum correlations .",
    "furthermore , he arranged that the local reduced states @xmath60 $ ] are thermal states for the two subsystems and so locally indistinguishable from classical thermal mixtures . despite being locally indistinguishable from classical thermal mixtures",
    ", the composite system behaves quite differently under any energy - conserving unitary . since the total initial state is a pure state we have that @xmath44=0 $ ] , which remains true at any later time . from a schmidt decomposition for @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "we find that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are isospectral , @xmath63 , and so their entropies are always equal .",
    "consequently , any unitary transformation occurring on the composite system will have @xmath64 .",
    "once again , assuming ( i ) no mechanical work and ( ii ) no overall change in the total energy , the condition on the heat flow between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath65 .",
    "however , since @xmath64 and @xmath66 we have that @xmath67 and so @xmath68 .",
    "energy conserving unitary interactions never _ increase _ the local entropies of either subsystem , in stark contrast to the uncorrelated situation of classically mixed thermal states , where @xmath69 never decreases .",
    "however , the model in @xcite does not actually require quantum entanglement .",
    "for example we may simply dephase @xmath70 to turn it into a classically correlated separable state that would produce the exact same reversal of the thermodynamic arrow .",
    "in addition , while the pure state @xmath59 allows local entropy decreases , and the reversal of the thermodynamic arrow , the isospectral constraint for the bipartite splitting of the pure state @xmath71 is very restrictive - the only way in which two different temperatures for @xmath11 and @xmath12 is achieved in @xcite is to impose that the energy spectrum of @xmath11 be a scaled version of the energy spectrum of @xmath12 .",
    "another undesirable feature of the model is that the initial thermal states that are considered in @xcite ( squeezed gaussian states of two oscillators ) are the _ only _ thermal states that are attainable in this setting - all other thermal states are inaccessible .    in the next section",
    "we extend the work of @xcite to show that we may distinguish entangled systems from classically correlated system through violations of thermodynamic arrow and produce transformations between arbitrary thermal states without restrictions on the energy spectra .",
    "furthermore , we analyze quantum systems in which the correlation structure is more complex and allows for a more subtle range of violations of the thermodynamic arrow .      recently @xcite the mutual information @xmath72 was given an operational meaning in terms of the minimal amount of local randomizing work that must be done on a bipartite system to reduce it to a product state and destroy all correlations .",
    "we will give here another thermodynamical interpretation - namely , the mutual information is a measure of the maximal amount that the isolated bipartite system may violate the thermodynamic arrow in the form of energy transfer from a colder subsystem to a hotter one .",
    "the total correlations , as quantified by @xmath72 , also contain classical correlations , which may be defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the classical ( shannon ) mutual information for the joint probability distributions generated by local povm measurements @xmath75 at @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the classical mutual information @xmath76 is always less than or equal to the total mutual information @xmath72 and vanishes if and only if the bipartite state is a product state@xcite .",
    "it is clear that for bipartite states @xmath16 the classical mutual information always obeys the bound @xmath77 , where @xmath0 is the dimensionality of the smaller subsystem . on the other hand , while the quantum mutual information @xmath72 is always positive , it can in general take on values larger than @xmath78 .",
    "however , if we write the quantum mutual information as @xmath79 and restrict ourselves to separable states @xmath16 for which @xmath80 is always greater than both @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite we may deduce that @xmath83 and so @xmath84 over the set of separable states .",
    "this upper bound is saturated for perfectly correlated , zero discord , separable states @xmath85 , in which case @xmath86 .",
    "however , for entangled states we can have @xmath87 , and so from ( [ flow ] ) we see that certain types of heat flow are possible that are forbidden classically .",
    "in particular a quantity of heat @xmath88 can be transferred from the cold subsystem to the hot system , whereas classical correlations could only permit at most a quantity of heat @xmath89 to flow from cold to hot . from this",
    "it follows that the reversal of the thermodynamic arrow of time is a new kind of entanglement witness where quantum correlations present in the state allow much larger violations of the arrow than are classically possible , and so the detection of such large reversals must imply an entangled state .",
    "standard entanglement witnesses correspond to an observable @xmath90 that defines a plane @xmath91 = 0 $ ] in state space separating entangled states from separable ones , while for us , it is the set of energetically accessible states that acts as the witness . instead of local observables , it is the transformations of the state that signal entanglement .    the classical mutual information @xmath76 has previously been considered in the context of the thermodynamic arrow as a candidate measure for the classical memory record that a system @xmath11 has of events that affect @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the claim in @xcite was that any event that decreases the entropy of @xmath12 necessarily reduces the classical mutual information between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and so entropy - decreasing events at @xmath12 do not leave a memory trace in @xmath11 .",
    "this was a proposed resolution to the empirical fact that we only observe entropy - decreasing events , namely the `` arrow of time dilemma '' .",
    "however , in @xcite we demonstrate explicitly that this claim is false , and in reality quantum mechanics allows the exact opposite to occur .",
    "we show that large quantum correlations present in a state can be used up to reverse the thermodynamic arrow and at the same time increase the classical correlations between two subsystems .",
    "quantum mechanics allows enhanced memory records of entropy - increasing events and so there can be no resolution of the arrow of time in terms of classical memory records .",
    "the process of dividing correlations into quantum and classical components has many subtle aspects and counter - intuitive results exist , for example in the setting of multipartite correlations it is possible to have purely quantum multipartite correlations without any classical multipartite correlations being present @xcite . in the next section we consider multipartite quantum systems that are in a highly entangled pure state and",
    "analyse how the quantum correlations present allow arbitrarily large reversals of the thermodynamic arrow .",
    "we now turn to an analysis of entanglement - assisted violations of the thermodynamic arrow in a general multipartite setting . once again",
    ", we consider an isolated system that may undergo a complex time - dependent interaction process between times @xmath21 and @xmath53 , but with the total energy , defined via a total hamiltonian @xmath92 , at time @xmath21 equal to the total energy at time @xmath53 .",
    "it is well known that most quantum states are highly entangled @xcite , however recently a deep theorem @xcite has shown that if the total system is large , then any randomly choosen pure state @xmath93 that satisfies the total energy constraint has the property that any sufficiently small subsystem is highly likely to be in a thermal state . for generic large systems in a pure state ,",
    "thermality of its subsystems naturally arises from the high degree of entanglement present in the state .",
    "consequently , instead of entangled thermal states such as in @xcite being artificial or exceptional , for large systems in a randomly chosen pure state they are actually quite typical .      for simplicity we shall consider the multiple subsystems @xmath94 , to be qubits , but it is clear that similar arguments apply to any higher dimensional subsystems .",
    "we take the reduced states , obtained by tracing out the other subsystems , to be initially thermal and the total system is assumed to be in a pure state @xmath95 with a fixed energy .",
    "we refer to the reduced states @xmath96 as the _ thermal marginals _ for the subsystems .",
    "however , not all sets of thermal marginals may be obtained from a global pure state @xmath95 . for the case of qubits , if the marginal states for the individual qubits are given by @xmath97 , then the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a pure state @xmath98 such that @xmath99 are in terms of the smallest eigenvalue of each subsystem , @xmath100 .",
    "the conditions are @xcite @xmath101    without loss of generality , we take the hamiltonians of each qubit to be equal , and choose the ground state to have zero energy while the excited state has energy 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the pauli operator for the @xmath104 direction , and for qubits with thermal marginals , the total expected energy of the system is then @xmath105 .",

    "a given collection of marginals the full state can have a vast array of different consistent correlations .",
    "the set of such consistent states @xmath195 contains states that differ in the correlations that exist between different combinations of subsystems .",
    "consequently , given subsystems @xmath196 , the reduced state @xmath197 can vary for different global states @xmath194 in @xmath195 .",
    "it is easy to see that while we might demand the individual subsystems @xmath198 to be thermal states , this thermality may appear at various levels of coarse graining on the collection of subsystems .",
    "for example we might have for a pair of subsystems @xmath199 and @xmath200 that @xmath201= \\rho_a \\otimes \\rho_b$ ] , however for a triple of subsystems @xmath202 the state @xmath203 is entangled .",
    "for such a situation , the thermodynamic arrow is present for any energy transfer process involving only the two subsystems @xmath139 and @xmath136 , however for processes involving three or more subsystems the correlations present allow violations of the thermodynamic arrow .",
    "consequently , the different possible correlation structures that can occur in a state @xmath204 correspond to a hierarchy of thermodynamic arrows .",
    "the set of states @xmath195 can be partitioned up as @xmath205 , where a state @xmath1 is in @xmath206 if there exists subsystems @xmath207 such that @xmath208 is observed for all transformations on @xmath209 and no larger set of subsystems exist with this property .",
    "it is not clear , however , if a non - trivial partitioning can be defined in which , for a state in a given class , the thermodynamic arrow holds for _ all _ marginals on @xmath210 subsystems .",
    "this classification of states in terms of their largest thermal marginal depends on the particular correlation structure of the global state without reference to where the subsystem are situated , however in more practical situations it makes sense to include a notion of locality .",
    "for example , we might consider a collection of subsystems @xmath211 located at various points in space .",
    "for a given subsystem @xmath199 we may define the notion of an `` arrow range '' , @xmath212 , which is the largest @xmath213 such that the reduced state @xmath214 on all subsystems within a distance @xmath213 of @xmath199 is a thermal marginal . for the entire state @xmath194",
    "we may then simply define a characteristic arrow range @xmath215 as the average over the set @xmath216 of ranges for each subsystem @xmath217 .",
    "states with large @xmath215 do possess correlations , however these correlations are difficult to access in practice , requiring many coordinated , local pairwise interactions @xmath218 in order to generate an effective multipartite interaction over the correlated state . on the other hand ,",
    "states with small values for @xmath215 , for example states of the form ( [ a1states ] ) or the state @xmath157 considered in the previous section , have correlations that are more easily accessible through local pairwise interactions .",
    "this provides a simple generalization of the ` local ' maxwell demon introduced in the first section",
    ". a demon should not only be finite in terms of its memory resources , but also in terms of the correlation range @xmath219 that it can probe .",
    "time , with its inexorable flow , is one of our oldest mysteries . in stark contrast , it is only in the last century that we have become aware of the quantum mechanical properties of nature , and only in the past few decades that some of the subtleties and power of quantum correlations have revealed themselves .    in this article",
    "we have examined some aspects of entanglement correlations , how they can reverse the standard thermodynamic arrow of time , and have shown that in this regard thermodynamic transformations may act as entanglement witnesses .",
    "we analysed how highly entangled multipartite states can make ordinarily forbidden thermodynamic states accessible .",
    "different correlation structures can give rise to the same set of local thermal states , and so processes involving several subsystems are in general required to exploit the entanglement present . the set of transformations on a system then possess a hierarchy of thermodynamic arrows , whether considered globally or in terms of local correlation ranges .",
    "the key aspect is to allow interactions that activate the correlations present , which we demonstrated with a mixed state example @xmath157 in which the thermodynamic arrrow is in place for interactions involving only @xmath11 and @xmath12 or for @xmath12 and @xmath121 , but by switching on an interaction with system @xmath121 this can be dramatically modified .",
    "it would be of interest to further explore the multipartite correlation structures that can occur in a quantum state - for example we might speculate that in the early , dense universe that @xmath215 is small enough to allow any random physical interactions to exploit the correlations present , producing a gradual disappearance of the thermodynamic arrow the closer we get to the initial state of the universe .",
    "of course such notions of locality rely on a classical spacetime background , and so we could only push the issue of the special initial conditions into the sub - planck scales , where a complete theory of quantum gravity would be required .",
    "another setting of interest is that of quantum field theory , where thermality arises naturally due to observers possessing causal horizons , such as in the case of black holes or for accelerated observers .",
    "once again , thermality can be viewed as arising from entanglement across the horizon , however it is unclear if these correlations could actually be utilized in any thermodynamic transformations . at a deeper level",
    ", it may also be fruitful to explore connections with the thermal time hypothesis due to connes and rovelli @xcite or recent work by padmanabhan @xcite that attempts to relate the cosmological arrow of time for our expanding universe with the thermodynamic arrow by exploiting the thermodynamics of local spacetime horizons .    finally , in a more grounded setting , it would be of interest to see if a mixed state @xmath157 , or one like it , could be realised experimentally to see how easily one might exploit quantum correlations present in a state to affect its thermodynamic behaviour .",
