    "cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole , and its aim is to understand the origin of the universe and its evolution .",
    "the study of the cosmos is as old as humanity and has always been fascinating .",
    "physical cosmology is the scientific study of the universe as a whole based on the laws of physics .",
    "the dominant interaction between macroscopic objects is the gravitational force .",
    "therefore , we must study the dynamics of the universe within the framework of einstein s theory of general relativity which was formulated in 1916 . in simple terms , the main concept of general relativity is the following equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a coupling constant which determines the strength of the gravitational force .",
    "@xmath2 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "the einstein field equations are a set of 10 coupled non - linear pdes , or in other words , very difficult equations to deal with in general  @xcite .",
    "however , these equations can be simplified considerably by making some suitable assumptions .",
    "in cosmology  @xcite this is known as the cosmological principle .",
    "it is an axiom which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed over large enough scales .",
    "these scales are of the order of @xmath4 . to translate this into more practical units , we note that @xmath5 .",
    "this means @xmath6 , and has the simple practical implication that we can not test the cosmological principle directly by making observations at two points in the universe separated by cosmologically significant scales .",
    "however , there are other possibilities of testing the cosmological principle . for instance , if we were to observe a very large structure in the universe which is bigger than @xmath7 , say , then this would force us to revise this number upwards .",
    "it turns out that such very large structure have already been observed , see the clowes ",
    "campusano large quasar group for one such example .",
    "henceforth we assume that the cosmological principle is valid for some suitable length scale .",
    "a homogeneous and isotropic 4-dimensional lorentzian manifold is characterised by only one function which is usually denoted by @xmath8 and one constant @xmath9 .",
    "such models were studied independently by friedmann , lematre , and robertson & walker .",
    "the function @xmath8 is called the scale factor and is the only dynamical degree of freedom in the cosmological einstein field equations .",
    "the constant @xmath10 characterises the curvature of the so - called constant time hypersurfaces , @xmath11 corresponds to a euclidean space , @xmath12 to a 3-sphere and @xmath13 to hyperbolic space .",
    "the cosmological einstein field equations are given by    [ field1 ] @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the so - called cosmological constant , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy density and pressure of some matter components , respectively .",
    "this matter could be a perfect fluid with prescribed equation of state , or a scalar field for instance .",
    "more complicated forms of matter can also be included .",
    "one can verify by direct calculation that these two equations imply the energy - conservation equation @xmath18 in cosmology one assumes that every matter component satisfies its own conservation equation , which does not follow from the field equations but must be assumed or derived separately . inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ field1 ] ) shows that we have two equations but 3 functions to be found , namely @xmath8 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this system of equations is under - determined . in order to close it , we will assume a linear equation of state between the pressure and the energy density @xmath21 , where the equation of state parameter @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the scale factor @xmath8 is a measure of the size of the universe at time @xmath23 .",
    "however , since we do not have an absolute length scale , the numerical value of @xmath8 can be rescaled .",
    "one convention is to choose @xmath24 and compare the universe s size with its current value .",
    "moreover , it turns out to be useful to introduce the hubble function @xmath25 which is a measure of the universe s expansion rate at time @xmath23 .",
    "a positive value for this quantity was first observed by edwin hubble in 1929 , thereby giving experimental evidence to an expanding universe . today s",
    "value @xmath26 is of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "let us now rewrite the field equations using the hubble parameter .",
    "firstly , we need the relation @xmath28 which allows us to write  ( [ field1 ] ) in the following form    @xmath29    equation  ( [ field2a ] ) is of particular interest to us . by dividing the entire equation by @xmath30",
    "we arrive at @xmath31 and observe that each of the three terms is dimensionless .",
    "it is common to introduce the following dimensionless density parameters @xmath32 note that @xmath33 may contain different forms of matter , the total matter content might contain a pressure - less perfect fluid ( standard matter or sometimes called dust ) and radiation , in which case one would write @xmath34 . before getting started with dynamical systems and their application to cosmology",
    ", we need to discuss some of the well known solutions in cosmology .",
    "we will now discuss the most important solutions of the field equations  ( [ field1 ] ) .",
    "this is needed in order to understand and interpret the solutions encountered later using dynamical systems techniques .    in order to simplify the equations",
    ", we will assume that the spatial curvature parameter vanishes , i.e.  @xmath11 and we will also neglect the cosmological term @xmath35 . let us firstly assume that the equation of state parameter @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to a matter dominated universe .",
    "one can immediately integrate the conservation equation  ( [ cons1 ] ) and find that @xmath37 this result is not unexpected since we find that density is inversely proportional to volume .",
    "using this result in the field equation  ( [ field1a ] ) yields the solutions @xmath38 .",
    "secondly , we consider @xmath39 which corresponds to a radiation dominated universe . in that case",
    ", the conservation equation gives @xmath40 and the remaining field equations can be solved to find @xmath41 .",
    "lastly , we consider the case where @xmath42 , however , we assume @xmath43",
    ". then , we can integrate  ( [ field2a ] ) and find @xmath44 this solution is generally called the de sitter solution and corresponds to a universe which undergoes an accelerated expansion .      based on a variety of observations , the evolution of the universe can be reconstructed fairly accurately .",
    "we are currently living in a matter dominated universe @xmath36 , and there is strong evidence for the presence of a positive cosmological constant @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the spatial curvature of the universe appears to be zero @xmath11 .",
    "there are some highly restrictive conditions in @xmath45 models .",
    "since the universe is currently expanding , it must have been smaller and denser in the past . from equations  ( [ matter ] ) and  ( [ rad ] )",
    "we see that radiation decays faster than matter in an expanding universe .",
    "therefore , at some point in the past , the universe was dominated by radiation .",
    "going back in time further , the universe was very dense and therefore hot and relatively small .",
    "the ` beginning ' of the universe is often referred to as the big bang , giving the image of a vast explosion from which the evolution of the universe started .",
    "it appears very likely that the universe also underwent a period of accelerated expansion at its very early stages , similar to the late time acceleration due to the cosmological term .",
    "the reasons for this are beyond the scope of this short introduction , however , we note that this epoch is called inflation .",
    "very roughly speaking , the standard model of cosmology can be summarised by the succession of the following dominated eras @xmath46 and a good cosmological model should be able to reproduce ( parts of ) this pattern .      in order to get a first taste of the usefulness of dynamical systems techniques in cosmology  @xcite ,",
    "let us consider a universe which is spatially flat @xmath11 , and its matter content is radiation @xmath47 with @xmath39 , and a perfect fluid ( dust ) @xmath48 with @xmath36 .",
    "the following four equations completely determine the dynamics of the system    [ ex : fall ] @xmath49    using the dimensionless density parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we find that equation  ( [ ex : f1 ] ) becomes the constraint @xmath53 which means that we have two independent quantities , and choose to work with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , since we expect energy densities to be positive we also have the conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , also @xmath56 is needed to satisfy equation  ( [ ex : c1 ] ) .",
    "the solution to the system  ( [ ex : fall ] ) at any given time @xmath23 will correspond to a point in the @xmath57 plane .",
    "the constraint equation  ( [ ex : c1 ] ) together with the aforementioned inequalities reduces the allowed @xmath57 plane to the triangle defined by @xmath58 , see also figure  [ fig1 ] .    .",
    "every solution to the field equations  ( [ ex : fall ] ) corresponds to a trajectory inside this triangle , one calls this region the phase space of the system.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    next , we wish to find the dynamical equations for the dimensionless variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this requires a slightly lengthy but otherwise straightforward calculation of which we will show some details .",
    "we start with @xmath59 from  ( [ ex : f4 ] ) we get an expression for @xmath60 , while  ( [ ex : f2 ] ) can be solved for @xmath61 .",
    "this yields @xmath62 the last step is to eliminate @xmath52 using  ( [ ex : c1 ] ) which gives the equation @xmath63 we now note that @xmath64 which means that by introducing the new independent variable @xmath65 and denoting differentiation with respect to @xmath66 by a prime , we finally arrive at @xmath67 following a similar calculation one can find the corresponding equation for @xmath51 which is given by @xmath68 for any set of initial conditions @xmath69 with initial ` time ' @xmath70 in the triangle @xmath71 , the equations  ( [ ex : o1 ] ) and  ( [ ex : o2 ] ) will determine a trajectory which describes the dynamical behaviour of the cosmological model we are studying .",
    "it should be noted that equations  ( [ ex : o1 ] ) and  ( [ ex : o2 ] ) do not depend explicitly on the ` time ' parameter @xmath66 , such a system is called an autonomous system of equations , or a dynamical system . equations of this type can be studied using particular methods developed for such systems . in the next section",
    "we will give a brief introduction to dynamical systems and the most common methods used to analyse them .",
    "what is a dynamical system ?",
    "it can be anything ranging from something as simple as a single pendulum to something as complex as the human brain and the entire universe itself .",
    "in general , a dynamical system can be thought of as any abstract system consisting of    1 .   a space ( state space or phase space ) , and 2 .   a mathematical rule describing the evolution of any point in that space .",
    "the second point is crucial . finding a mathematical rule which , for instance , describes the evolution of information at any neuron in the human brain is probably impossible .",
    "so , we need a mathematical rule as an input and finding one might be very difficult indeed",
    ".    the state of the system we are interested in is described by a set of quantities which are considered important about the system , and the state space is the set of all possible values of these quantities . in the case of the pendulum ,",
    "the position of the mass and its momentum are natural quantities to specify the state of the system . for more complicated systems like the universe as a whole ,",
    "the choice of good quantities is not at all obvious and it turns out to be useful to choose convenient variables .",
    "it is possible to analyse the same dynamical system with different sets of variables , either of which might be more suitable to a particular question .",
    "there are two main types of dynamical systems : the first are continuous dynamical systems whose evolution is defined by a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and the other ones are called time - discrete dynamical systems which are defined by a map or difference equations . in the context of cosmology",
    "we are studying the einstein field equations which for a homogeneous and isotropic space result in a system of odes .",
    "thus we are only interested in continuous dynamical systems and will not discuss time - discrete dynamical systems in the remainder .",
    "let us denote @xmath72 to be an element of the state space @xmath73 .",
    "the standard form of a dynamical system is usually expressed as  @xcite @xmath74 where the function @xmath75 and where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to some suitable time parameter .",
    "we view the function @xmath76 as a vector field on @xmath77 such that @xmath78 the odes  ( [ dy1 ] ) define the vector fields of the system . at any point @xmath79 and any particular time @xmath23",
    ", @xmath80 defines a vector field in @xmath77 .",
    "when discussing a particular solution to  ( [ dy1 ] ) this will often be denoted by @xmath81 to simplify the notation .",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems which are are finite dimensional and continuous .",
    "in fact , we will require the function @xmath82 to be at least differentiable in @xmath83 .",
    "the autonomous equation @xmath84 is said to have a critical point or fixed point at @xmath85 if and only if @xmath86 .",
    "[ def1 ]    there is an easy way to justify this definition .",
    "let us consider a one dimensional mechanical system with force @xmath87 .",
    "newton s equation for such a system is @xmath88 let us introduce a second variable @xmath89 such that the single second order ode  ( [ newton ] ) becomes a system of two first order equations @xmath90 therefore , according to definition  [ def1 ] , the critical points of system  ( [ newton2 ] ) correspond to those points @xmath91 where the force vanishes @xmath92 . at these points , there is no force acting on the particle and the system could",
    ", in principle , remain in this ( steady ) state indefinitely .",
    "this leads to the question of stability of a critical point or fixed point .",
    "the following two definitions will clarify what is meant by stable and asymptotically stable .",
    "in simple words a fixed point @xmath93 of the system  ( [ dy1 ] ) is called stable if all solutions @xmath94 starting near @xmath95 stay close to it .",
    "let @xmath95 be a fixed point of system  ( [ dy1 ] ) .",
    "it is called stable if for every @xmath96 we can find a @xmath97 such that if @xmath81 is any solution of  ( [ dy1 ] ) satisfying @xmath98 , then the solution @xmath81 exists for all @xmath99 and it will satisfy @xmath100 for all @xmath99 . [ def2 ]    the point is called asymptotically stable if it is stable and the solutions approach the critical point for all nearby initial conditions .",
    "let @xmath95 be a stable fixed point of system  ( [ dy1 ] ) .",
    "it is called asymptotically stable if there exists a number @xmath97 such that if @xmath81 is any solution of  ( [ dy1 ] ) satisfying @xmath98 , then @xmath101 .",
    "[ def3 ]    the main difference is simply that all trajectories near an asymptotically stable fixed point will eventually reach that point while trajectories near a stable point could for instance circle around that point .",
    "if the point is unstable then solutions will move away from it .",
    "we will not encounter fixed points which are stable but not asymptotically stable when studying cosmological dynamical systems .    having defined a concept of stability",
    ", we will now discuss methods which can be used to analyse the stability properties of critical points .",
    "the basic idea of linear stability theory can be explained neatly using the above one dimensional mechanical system @xmath102 .",
    "let us assume that there is a point @xmath93 where the force vanishes @xmath103 .",
    "can we find the behaviour of the particle near this point ?",
    "we set @xmath104 and assume @xmath105 to be small .",
    "then @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( recall @xmath103 ) so that newton s equations near the critical point becomes @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a constant .",
    "this is a linear second order constant coefficient ode , its auxiliary equation is simply @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the sign of @xmath109 determines the stability properties of the point @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath111 the solution involves trigonometric functions and we would speak of a stable point , for @xmath112 the solution would involve exponentials and we would refer to this point as unstable .",
    "exactly the same ideas can be utilised when studying an arbitrary dynamical system .",
    "let @xmath84 be a given dynamical system with fixed point at @xmath95 .",
    "we will now linearise the system around its critical point .",
    "since @xmath113 , we can taylor expand each @xmath114 near @xmath95 @xmath115 where the vector @xmath116 is defined by @xmath117 .",
    "note that in what follows we are only interested in the first partial derivatives .",
    "therefore , of particular importance is the object @xmath118 which if interpreted as a matrix is the jacobian matrix of vector calculus of the vector valued function @xmath76 .",
    "we define @xmath119 it is the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath120 , evaluated at the critical points @xmath95 , which contain the information about stability . in this context @xmath120",
    "is sometimes referred to as the stability matrix of the system . as @xmath120 is an @xmath121 matrix",
    ", it will have @xmath122 , possibly complex , eigenvalues ( counting repeated eigenvalues accordingly ) . recalling the example of the one dimensional mechanical system at the beginning , it is clear that this approach might encounter problems if one or more of the eigenvalues are zero .",
    "this motivates the following definition  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath123 be a fixed point ( critical point ) of the system @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath93 is said to be hyperbolic if none of the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath124 have zero real part . otherwise the point is called non - hyperbolic .",
    "linear stability theory fails for non - hyperbolic points and other methods have to be employed to study the stability properties .    roughly speaking we are distinguishing three broad cases : if all eigenvalues have negative real parts , then we can regard the point as stable .",
    "if at least one eigenvalues has a positive real part , then the corresponding fixed point would not be stable and correspond to a saddle point which attracts trajectories in some directions but repels them along others .",
    "lastly , all eigenvalues could have a positive real part , in which case all trajectories would be repelled .    in more than 3 dimensions",
    "it becomes very difficult to classify all possible critical points based on their eigenvalues .",
    "however , in dimensions 2 and 3 this can be done . in the following we present all possible cases for two dimensional autonomous systems .",
    "let us consider the two dimensional autonomous system given by    [ 2dsys ] @xmath125    where @xmath82 and @xmath126 are ( smooth ) functions of @xmath91 and @xmath127 .",
    "we assume that there exits a hyperbolic critical point at @xmath128 so that @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the system is given by @xmath131 where the @xmath132 means differentiation with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "its two eigenvalues @xmath133 are given by    @xmath134    and be evaluated at any fixed point @xmath128 .",

    "it should be noted that the inequality signs in table  [ crit2 ] exclude certain values from the analysis .",
    "for instance , when we choose @xmath140 , the two points b and c have the same coordinates ( the system has one critical point less ) , namely @xmath141 and @xmath142 so that @xmath143 and its eigenvalues are @xmath144 .",
    "linear stability theory can not determine the stability of this point .",
    "one could , in principle , apply centre manifold theory . however , this is problematic as the physical phase space is bounded by the unit circle and centre manifold theory will take into account the entire phase space .",
    "one could construct the centre manifold and only consider it inside the circle but this also has problems . for concreteness we set @xmath145 in the following , which means @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the easiest way forward is to use lyapunov s method near this point .",
    "we start with the candidate lyapunov function of the form @xmath148 and one verify that this function satisfies @xmath149 near the critical point .",
    "since the function is positive definite near that point by construction , we can apply theorem  [ lyapunovtheorem ] .",
    "following for instance  @xcite , we can estimate the region of asymptotic stability . defining @xmath150 for @xmath151 , and denoting by @xmath152 the component of @xmath153 containing the critical point , we have the following statement  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 be the set where @xmath149 , then the interior of @xmath152 contained in @xmath33 lies in the region of asymptotic stability . as mentioned earlier",
    ", this approach relies on our ability to find a suitable lyapunov function .",
    "different choices can result in different parts of the region of asymptotic stability being covered and there is no guarantee that the entire region can be identified by this method alone . in fig .",
    "[ fig_d4 ] , we show the region of asymptotic stability based on the lyapunov function  ( [ vdyn ] ) for model  ( [ xyp ] ) .",
    "a better lyapunov function would of course improve this picture and increase the region .     and @xmath154 .",
    "the shaded area shows part of the region of asymptotic stability of the fixed point . in this region @xmath149 and @xmath155.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    a detailed and comprehensive phase - space analysis , based on linear stability theory alone , of this model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "other methods were explored in  @xcite .",
    "a complete discussion of all its properties in the context of cosmology is also given .",
    "this model has many interesting features as well as some problems which motivates various extensions , many of which have been considered in the literature . in fact , the literature of dynamical systems applications in early - time and late - time cosmology is so vast , that it could fill several books with ease !",
    "we should point out that this model falls short our wish list  ( [ wishlist ] ) .",
    "the early time fixed points @xmath156 are dominated by the scalar field , however , the effective equation of state is @xmath157 which is unphysical .",
    "it is point c which makes this model so interesting because this fixed point is stable and contains both , a non - vanishing scalar field and matter .",
    "one speaks of scaling solutions as the scalar field energy density is proportional to that of the fluid .",
    "the models considered so far were all two dimensional .",
    "this relied on the fact that we were able to ` eliminate ' the hubble parameter @xmath158 from the equations due to a smart choice of variables and a clever choice of ` time ' .",
    "however , there are many known models where this approach does not work and one has to introduce new variables . in",
    "the following we will discuss one such type of models and a possible choice of a new variable .",
    "the cosmological einstein field equations  ( [ eqn : sca1])([eqn : sca2 ] ) are compatible with the introduction of an additional interaction term @xmath159 , say . this interaction would allow for an energy transfer from the scalar @xmath160 to the matter @xmath161 and vice versa . the introduction of such a term leaves eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sca1 ] ) unchanged , but  ( [ eqn : sca2 ] ) becomes    [ eqn : sca3 ] @xmath162    where we note that the term @xmath163 is natural when one computes the conservation equation @xmath164 .",
    "various choices for the coupling function @xmath159 were considered in the literature , for instance @xmath165 or @xmath166 with @xmath167 and @xmath168 being dimensionless constants whose sign determines the direction of energy transfer from one component to the other  @xcite . those two choices can be motivated physically , however , one of the main motivation is the fact that the dynamical system with these coupling remains two dimensional as the hubble parameter can be eliminated from the equations .",
    "however , both choices appear rather arbitrary and one would prefer a choice where the coupling is simply proportional to an energy density , for instance @xmath169 with @xmath170 assumed to be small , see  @xcite , or for a further generalisation  @xcite . in this case",
    "the phase space can not be represented in the plane and one has to work in a three dimensional space .    as before ,",
    "we start with the variables  ( [ compact ] ) but need a third variable in order to be able to write the cosmological field equations as an autonomous system of differential equations .",
    "a possible third variable @xmath171 can be chosen to be @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the hubble parameter at an arbitrary fixed time .",
    "it is convenient to chose this time to be ` today ' .",
    "this variable @xmath171 ensures that the physical phase - space is compact .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath174 in the early time universe and @xmath175 for the late time universe .",
    "therefore @xmath176 and @xmath171 is bounded by @xmath177 . since the phase - space of system  ( [ xyp ] ) is half a unit circle , we have that with coupling term @xmath169 the phase - space now corresponds to a half - cylinder of unit height and unit radius .",
    "the resulting dynamical system is given by    [ withcoup ] @xmath178    where @xmath179 .",
    "a detailed phase - space analysis of this model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "however , this model also has some additional interesting features outside the standard linear stability theory .",
    "for instance , there is a point vertically above point d in fig .",
    "[ fig_ql4 ] which attract trajectories .",
    "the system  ( [ withcoup ] ) , however , does not have a critical point there .    ) with @xmath180 and @xmath181.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ] +    by inspecting equations  ( [ withcoup ] ) at @xmath182 we note that @xmath183 and that    [ withcoup2 ] @xmath184    for some small coupling term @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , as the trajectories approach the @xmath186 plane , we have that also @xmath187 .",
    "however , the behaviour of @xmath188 is more involved as @xmath189 on the other hand , @xmath185 but @xmath190 as @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , the fraction @xmath192 will initially be small .",
    "however , eventually the @xmath193 term will dominate and @xmath192 will become large , explaining the repeller behaviour of this point in fig .",
    "[ fig_ql4 ] .",
    "it is hoped that this chapter succeeded in giving the reader a useful introduction into the exciting field of dynamical systems in cosmology .",
    "we should remark that the majority of papers dealing with the subject are confined to linear stability theory and focus more on the interpretation of results in the context of cosmology . however , there are many models where a more in depth analysis is needed to gain a complete understanding of the physics involved .",
    "moreover , there is no need to select models primarily because of their simpler mathematical structure since we have all the tools at hand to study the more difficult ones too .",
