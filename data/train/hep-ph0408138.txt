    "<S> low scale supersymmetry is one of the most promising solutions to the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we expect to detect and measure such a new physics at tev scale by high energy collider experiment at lhc in the near future . in the case of supersymmetry models </S>",
    "<S> , lhc might discover some colored supersymmetric particles and establish the presence of supersymmetry or its extension . </S>",
    "<S> in such an era , we shall proceed to the next step , the determination of model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this is inevitable for further study of physics at high energy scale , including flavor structure and its origin .    </S>",
    "<S> the flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) is one of the most attractive phenomena to investigate supersymmetry and further physics at higher energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> in fact fcnc in the sm is sufficiently suppressed by the gim mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has the additional particles , and the superpartner of matters has flavor mixings in the mass matrix . </S>",
    "<S> fcnc is then sensitive to these mixings and becomes large generically . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor mixings between first two generations are strongly constrained from the @xmath1 mixing , and @xmath2 mixings are also limited experimentally . on the other hand , the supersymmetry contributions to squark flavor changing amplitudes between @xmath3 generations , in which we study especially the @xmath4 transition here , may be large even when we consider the experimental constraint from the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath5 and the neutron and atomic edms  @xcite . that is , the @xmath4 transition is useful to study models of supersymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the squark mixings generally have an @xmath6 phase and induce cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore as noted later , the processes which have both violations of cp and flavor are much sensitive to the imaginary part of the squark mixings . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect it to be possible to measure those parameters without suffering from large uncertainties in future experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one of the most attractive processes which include both cp violating and flavor changing is the mixing - induced cp asymmetry for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> belle has reported large deviation , @xmath8  @xcite , from the sm prediction , which is @xmath9 away , though babar result is @xmath10  @xcite in agreement with the sm . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the situation is not settled yet , however if the belle result is correct , it is not only the first signal for new physics through @xmath4 fcnc processes , but also it implies large cp violating phase in the scalar bottom to strange flavor mixings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in this letter we focus on the situation that cp symmetry is almost maximally violated in the @xmath4 squark mixings .    </S>",
    "<S> although the masses of the supersymmetric particles will be measured at lhc , in order to study the flavor mixings in the squark mass matrices we need some experiments with high luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> particularly super @xmath0 factory with the luminosity of @xmath11 is very useful for the measurement of the @xmath4 mixings . </S>",
    "<S> actually various fcnc processes with cp violation are proposed to be measured with high accuracy . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the cp violating processes , the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of @xmath7 ( @xmath12 ) , of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the direct cp asymmetry of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and the @xmath19 mixing ( @xmath20 ) , after one year of running at super @xmath0 factory .    </S>",
    "<S> so far many studies for the supersymmetric contributions to the @xmath4 transitions have been made . </S>",
    "<S> some are interested in potential to detect the mssm and some flavor models through the transition processes . </S>",
    "<S> the authors in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite investigated the processes in systematic way for some typical flavor models in supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> their study is not only to search potential for detection but also to identify these models at super @xmath0 factory and they showed that the processes are very helpful . </S>",
    "<S> however this argument is based on model dependent analysis . rather for the purpose of investigation of higher scale physics more definitely , we need model independent one . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in this letter we do not assume any flavor models , and study the @xmath4 transition processes in model independent way .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass insertion approximation ( mia )  @xcite is a powerful technique for model independent analysis of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> when off - diagonal elements in the squark mass matrices are small enough , the squark propagators with @xmath21 fcnc can be expanded as a series in terms of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the squared down - type - squark mass matrix , @xmath24 an averaged squark mass . </S>",
    "<S> there is chirality structure in the squark mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that these parameters generically have an @xmath6 phase and imaginary part of them induces cp and flavor violations simultaneously . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we discuss potential to constrain and measure these mia parameters by the data of the @xmath4 transition processes which will be measured in future at super @xmath0 factory and lhc .    here </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath19 mixing , @xmath20 , is also interesting here . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 depends on the four - quark operators and the double - mass - insertion diagrams do not dominate . as a result , it is possible to distinguish the ll and rr mixings from the others by this process . </S>",
    "<S> as will be mentioned later only a product of @xmath54 and @xmath70 induces large @xmath20  @xcite , which may be detected at lhc  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> too large mia parameters however exceed the current bounds from @xmath71 and the contribution of the strange quark color electric - dipole - moment operator ( cedm ) to the neutron and atomic edms . </S>",
    "<S> we consider these processes as a constraint on the parameter space .    </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the model parameters in this letter . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 transition processes are selected so that a number of the parameters is as small as possible . in fact , the relevant soft parameters are the squark masses @xmath24 , the gluino mass @xmath51 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath72 and @xmath58 ( and top trilinear coupling for the contribution to the strange cedm from chargino mediated diagram  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> also the real part of the wilson coefficients includes the neutralino and chargino masses and the charged higgs mass .    before proceeding to each modes , </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the other fcnc processes . </S>",
    "<S> there are attractive observables other than those in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath73 is triggered by mediating the higgses and may become sizable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the supersymmetry contributions to the observables depend strongly on additional model parameters like higgs mass ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus we do not consider those processes in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio of the inclusive decay @xmath5 is one of the most important processes when we consider the @xmath4 transition . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the branching ratio is proportional to the sum of the squared wilson coefficients , @xmath74 , at the leading order . and the sm prediction of the branching ratio , which can be calculated cleanly , is now in agreement with experimental data  @xcite within errors . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> too large @xmath4 transition amplitude is excluded by considering @xmath75  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction has been calculated at next - to - leading order in renormalization group improved perturbation theory and its error is about 10 %  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected to be reduced down to 5 % within a few years when all next - to - next - to - leading - order corrections are included  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental error will be also reduced 10 % to 5 % at super @xmath0 factory after one year of running  @xcite . despite of these expectations </S>",
    "<S> , we consider @xmath75 just as a constraint on the parameter space and are less interested in detection ability of supersymmetry in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> thus we take a rather conservative value , @xmath76 instead of improved value which we expect in the near future .    </S>",
    "<S> the mia parameters are also constrained by the edms , though there are large hadronic uncertainties left . </S>",
    "<S> the squark mixings contribute to the strange quark cedm and the cedm is limited by the neutron and atomic edms . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron edm now gives the strongest bound  @xcite , @xmath77 where the number in the parentheses represents the assumption of the pecci - quinn ( pq ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the deuteron edm is also proposed and its sensitivity is @xmath78 @xmath79 cm . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> at first we find that the gluino diagram contributions generically impose strong correlations on the squark mixings  @xcite , @xmath80 for the soft masses @xmath81 gev and @xmath82 gev . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we thus assume that the phases of the squark mixings are perfectly aligned . </S>",
    "<S> finally the chargino diagram also gives a sizable contribution to the strange cedm  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the mia parameters are favored to have the maximal phase by considering the constraint from @xmath71 and the hadronic edms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we assume the squark mixings to be pure imaginary in the following analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly we study the measurement ability for the squark mixings at super @xmath0 factory . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we do not consider the uncertainties due to the calculation method of the @xmath4 processes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , although we use the generalized factorization method for estimating @xmath12 , the technique is expected to be improved in future and the uncertainties may be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , other than the squark mixings we have other relevant model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> those parameters are assumed to be measured at lhc and we do not include their ambiguities in the result . </S>",
    "<S> we consider only experimental errors as the resultant uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> third , some processes in this letter are planned to be measured at lhc and super @xmath0 factory . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an era after one year of running at super @xmath0 factory . </S>",
    "<S> currently the proposed luminosity is not settled yet and the expected experimental errors for each processes at super kekb are summarized in table .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : superkekb ]  @xcite . with these values </S>",
    "<S> the squark mixings are determined and we show the result for the both cases of the luminosities .    </S>",
    "<S> fourth , the experimental uncertainty of @xmath20 is proposed to be negligibly small at lhc . as a result , the theoretical uncertainty becomes much larger than the experimental error , unlike the other observables in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> thus we consider the theoretical ambiguity for @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we use a value 10 % for the uncertainty in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> let us show the numerical result based on the setup given above . </S>",
    "<S> at first we assume the lr and rl squark mixings to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the total mixings satisfy with @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : llrr ] displays the numerical estimation of @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the constant contours of these observables for changing the squark mixings , @xmath54 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> here we take the other model parameters as , the relevant soft masses ( including @xmath72 ) @xmath143 gev and @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> some parameter regions are excluded experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the region of larger @xmath54 and/or @xmath70 exceeds the bound from @xmath75 . also too large @xmath54 suffers from the edms . </S>",
    "<S> here we show the bound from the neutron edm with the pq symmetry , though this constraint is weaker for this parameter set .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] we take a center value of each mode as @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . </S>",
    "<S> although these are just reference , we choose @xmath12 to have a large deviation from the sm considering the current result from belle . </S>",
    "<S> each experimental uncertainty is denoted as the band at the luminosity of 5 ab@xmath149 for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] ( a ) and 50 ab@xmath149 for ( b ) , except for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed a signal of @xmath18 may be measured at super @xmath0 factory as long as @xmath150 is large , the parameters here is not suitable to determine the squark mixings from @xmath18 , because of the wide extent of the uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> actually , we note the edge of the @xmath18 error band is drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we take @xmath151 ps@xmath149 with 10 % error as explained above .    </S>",
    "<S> the squark mixings are determined by @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 . as noted above since their dependences to the squark mixings </S>",
    "<S> are different , the mia parameters can be measured . </S>",
    "<S> there is a region where the uncertainty band of all these observables overlaps with each other , which is filled by yellow and enclosed by red solid lines in the figures . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] we find that for the luminosity 5 ab@xmath149 the squark mixings are determined with an error of @xmath152 % , on the other hand , the result is improved when the luminosity is 50 ab@xmath149 and its uncertainty becomes about 10 % .    </S>",
    "<S> fcnc is also induced by the lr and rl mixings . </S>",
    "<S> we consider these mixings as an origin of flavor mixings instead of the ll and rr case . </S>",
    "<S> since we focus on the dipole - penguin dominant processes , as stressed above the contours of these processes are found to be nearly the same as the ll and rr ones except for the scale of the axes , which are approximately rescaled by @xmath37 s in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : totalmixing ] ) . actually the contour lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] just shift about 30 % at most for the rescaled axes . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the error estimation of the resultant squark mixings becomes the same as that of ll and rr , and we obtain the uncertainties of @xmath152 % for 5 ab@xmath149 and about 10 % for 50 ab@xmath149 .    the mixture case of the ll , rr , lr and rl squark mixings is more complex . when the contributions from these four mixings are comparable , the uncertainty width is larger than the result estimated above . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the coefficients @xmath37 s do not satisfy with @xmath153 exactly . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if we have no information on the ratios of the squark mixings , the error bands become about 30 % wider . in that case , the total mixings are consequently determined with the uncertainties about 40 % at the luminosity of 50 ab@xmath149 .    in order to identify the four squark mixings </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath19 mixing is useful because @xmath20 is controlled by the product of the ll and rr squark mixings . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : deltams ] shows the constant contours of @xmath20 for varying the ratio of lr ( rl ) component . on the other hand , in this figure the total mixings @xmath154 are fixed and as a result the other observables in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] change little . </S>",
    "<S> hence from @xmath20 we obtain one relation for the squark mixings in the fixed total mixings .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we can definitely distinguish the ll+rr case from the others by observing large @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore when both the ll and rr mixings are dominant , @xmath20 is helpful to measure those mixings more precisely . </S>",
    "<S> in fact from fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : llrr ] the error band is very narrow even when we consider the theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> this is striking when we measure the squark mixings at the lower luminosity of 5 ab@xmath149 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the mixture case is more complex and we need detailed analysis .    in the above discussion we assumed the condition that the phase of all squark mixings align to each other . </S>",
    "<S> one of the reasons comes from the experimental constraint from the edms . </S>",
    "<S> although the ll ( lr ) squark mixing is forced to align with rr ( rl ) , when both the rr and rl mixings are very suppressed the relative phase between ll and lr mixings becomes loose . and </S>",
    "<S> the exchanged case of @xmath38 is also true . </S>",
    "<S> then the phase may induce larger uncertainty in the squark mixings . </S>",
    "<S> however even in such a special case , since we are interested in the situation that anomaly of @xmath12 is large here , the phase is favored to be maximal . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we reproduce the above result .    </S>",
    "<S> a different choice of center values of the observables modifies the result . </S>",
    "<S> the error band of @xmath16 becomes wide in contrast to @xmath12 and @xmath14 when @xmath155 increases . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we will not expect sizable @xmath18 there . as a result , in such a region </S>",
    "<S> the total rr squark mixing may be measured with larger uncertainty , though the total ll squark mixing is again determined at the same level in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : llrr ] .    we comment on the dependence of the result to the other model parameters and the effects from the real part of the squark mixings . </S>",
    "<S> first let us consider other sets of the soft masses . </S>",
    "<S> when the gluino , the scalar bottom and the scalar strange become heavy , all the @xmath4 transition amplitudes are suppressed and vice versa . as a result , the uncertainties of the squark mixings change little . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the chargino contributions to the hadronic edms have different dependence to the soft masses . </S>",
    "<S> they are enhanced by smaller up - type squark and chargino masses , contrary to the other observables and constraint . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the ll squark mixing is bounded strongly and the uncertainty becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> also the higgsino mass parameter enhances the gluino contributions to the observables , but do not the chargino contributions too much . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the region of smaller @xmath72 may again suffer from the hadronic edms . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the lr mixing is however free from the constraint . </S>",
    "<S> second , other choices of the masses of the chargino , the neutralino and the charged higgs modify the real part of the wilson coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> however the effect is weak and we obtain the almost same result . finally , the future measurement of @xmath12 may inform us that the squark mixings are not restricted to be pure imaginary . </S>",
    "<S> then the non - vanishing real part generally makes the uncertainties large . in such a case , we need more information on the model parameters by some additional observables </S>",
    "<S> .    finally we touch on the flavor - changing neutral higgs boson decays into the bottom and strange quarks . in the sm , the @xmath156 boson exchange diagram contributes to the mode , and the result is found to be very small . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the gluino exchange diagram with the squark mixing generally induces a flavor - changing coupling of the higgs . </S>",
    "<S> the authors in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that the supersymmetry contribution can overshoot that of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it becomes larger by about three orders of magnitude when the squark mixing takes the value used in the above analysis . </S>",
    "<S> then such a large branching ratio of the flavor - changing higgs decay may be detected at lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> when lhc starts running and confirms supersymmetry , we come to the next stage , that is , to determine the parameters in supersymmetry models and to investigate physics at higher energy . </S>",
    "<S> super @xmath0 factory is very appropriate to measure the squark mixings , which induce fcnc and cp violation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we studied potential to constrain and measure the squark mixings at super @xmath0 factory . with the prospected data after one year of running we found the mixings </S>",
    "<S> is determined at about 10 % level at best . however </S>",
    "<S> this result is based on theoretical improvements of estimation and on some assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> thus we need more rigorous studies . </S>"
