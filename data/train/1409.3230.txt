    "seiberg duality @xcite is one of the most interesting properties of the supersymmetric gauge theories since it appears only from the strongly coupled dynamics which is not analyzed perturbatively .",
    "since it is an ir duality , the system which we concern can be described in two ways . one of them sometimes is very useful description for us .",
    "though seiberg dualities are constructed in diverse space - time dimensions , we are especially interested in the three- and four - spacetime dimensions because our world is 4d and 4d physics are sometimes well - understood in terms of 3d physics ( for example , see @xcite ) . in 4d ,",
    "the seiberg duality is first constructed in @xmath4 supersymmetric gauge theory with only the fundamental matters and it is generalized to the theory with various matter fields ( see @xcite for example and references therein ) . especially the 4d seiberg duality with an adjoint matter was studied in the presence of a superpotential for the adjoint matter @xcite , which is called kutasov - schwimmer duality ( another type of the potentail is considered in @xcite ) . in 3d the seiberg duality is first studied in @xcite as well as the dualities for chern - simons gauge theories @xcite,@xcite . the duality in @xcite",
    "is now called aharony duality and the chern - simons dualities are called collectively giveon - kutasov dualities and the relation between the aharony dual and the giveon - kutasov dual is now revealed @xcite .",
    "the ralation between 3d and 4d dualities was previously not clear .",
    "recently a general procedure to obtain 3d dualities from the 4d seiberg dualities has been constructed @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors claimed that it is important to consider the theory on @xmath5 , to take into account the nonperturbative dynamics from the effect of the compactification to @xmath5 and to take a low - energy limit with the relations @xmath6 kept in order to derive the corresponding 3d duality , where @xmath7 are the dynamical scales in the electric and magnetic sides respectively and @xmath8 is the radius of the circle . as an example they applied it to the conventional seiberg duality @xcite in which only the fundamental matters are included .",
    "they found that the 3d @xmath9 sqcd is dual to the @xmath10 gauge theory with some fields contents .",
    "they also analyzed the dualities for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 gauge groups .",
    "however such a general procedure above is not directly applied to the generic seiberg duality in 4d since including the various matter fields , for instance an adjoint , symmetric or anti - symmetric matters etc . , makes the structure of the coulomb branch even complicated .",
    "the 3d dualities with an adjoint matter are studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the dual of the 3d @xmath13 supersymmetric @xmath0 gauge theory with the superpotential @xmath14 is constructed and it is called kim - park duality .",
    "this is derived by generalization of the aharony duality @xcite .",
    "the aharony duality can be seen as the 3d counterpart to the 4d conventional seiberg duality but for @xmath10 gauge group . the 3d @xmath1 duality with an adjoint matter",
    "is studied in @xcite , in which the duality is obtained by using the un - gauging technique @xcite . although the dualities with an adjoint matter are known for 3d and 4d , the relation between them is obscure .    in this paper",
    "the relation between the 3d and 4d dualities with adjoint matter is investigated especially with focus on the @xmath10 and @xmath9 gauge groups .",
    "we study the seiberg duality with an adjoint matter on @xmath5 carefully , study the non - pertubative effect of the compacttification and derive the corresponding 3d duality by using the 4d kutasov - schwimmer duality . in @xmath10 case , we find the dual description of the kim - park duality . in @xmath9 case",
    "we find the duality by using the mirror description @xcite .",
    "the obtained dualities are precisely the same as one obtained by @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the basic ingredients in 3d @xmath13 gauge theories and how to derive generically 3d dualities from 4d dualities . in section 2 and section 3",
    "we consider the specific case of the 3d dual from 4d dual with an adjoint matter for @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge groups . in section 4",
    "we summarize what we found and discuss the future directions and open problems .",
    "in this section we will give the basic properties of the @xmath13 supersymmetric gauge theories in 3d and review how to derive the 3d dualities from 4d dualities .",
    "we first review the 3d @xmath13 gauge theories which are obtained by dimensional reduction of the 4d @xmath4 supersymmetric gauge theories which have four supercharges .",
    "the moduli spaces of the 3d @xmath13 gauge theories are composed of the higgs branch and coulomb branch .",
    "the higgs branch is described by the gauge singlet composite operators as mesons and baryons which are constrained both classically and in a quantum way .",
    "if we include the adjoint matter , the coulomb branch which is parametrized by this adjoint squark should be taken into account .",
    "the additional coulomb moduli which are absent in @xmath15 @xmath4 sqcd appear due to the adjoint scalars in a 3d vector superfield .",
    "the vector superfields in 3d contain the adjoint scalars due to the gauge fields in 4d along the compactified direction @xmath16 .",
    "the 3d photon is dual to the real compact scalar @xmath17 thus we describe the additional coulomb branch as the complex scalar field : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 3d @xmath20 gauge coupling . for the @xmath10 gauge group",
    ", we classically have the following set of the coordinates : @xmath21 while for the @xmath9 gauge group we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the 3d gauge couplings for @xmath10 and @xmath9 respectively . due to the quantum effect ,",
    "part of these coordinates are lifted , hence the unlifted quantum coulomb branch is described by @xmath24 in the presence of the adjoint matter , we have the independent monopole operators @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the diagonal components of the adoint matter field @xmath28 .",
    "these monopole operators are truncated at @xmath29 if the superpotential for the adjoint matter @xmath28 is included : @xmath30    in contrast to the 4d @xmath4 sqcd , we can introduce real masses to the chiral superfields aside from the complex masses .",
    "this is turned on by gauging the flavor symmetries and adding the vevs for the adjoint scalars of the vector superfields associated with the flavor symmetries .",
    "the mass terms for the quarks become @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the flavor indices and @xmath33 are the gauge indices . in the @xmath10 sqcd , since the @xmath34 baryon symmetry is gauged , then we can introduce only the real masses which is traceless .    in order to connect the 4d dualities with 3d dualities we need to consider the physics on @xmath5 . especially the topological solitons on @xmath5",
    "do the crucial jobs for the low - energy dynamics connecting the 3d and 4d theories .",
    "the instantons on @xmath5 are kk - monopoles ( or these are called twisted instantons ) whose fermionic zero modes are counted by the so - called callias index theorem @xcite and the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite ( or we can use the @xmath5 index theorem @xcite ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 defines the monopole charge and it is a linear combination of the dual simple roots .",
    "the summation about @xmath38 is taken over all the weights in the representation of the field contents .",
    "these theorems constrain which types of superpotential are generated dynamically .",
    "namely , if and only if the kk - monopole vertex contains the only two fermionic zero modes , the superpotentials are generated . the superpotentials which appear around the kk - monopole typically contain the coulomb branch coordinates and some matter fields . in the next section",
    "we actually derive the non - perturbative superpotential generated by kk - monopoles in the presence of the adjoint matter .    to obtain the 3d duality we need to take the unusual low - energy limit ; @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in such a process we need to include the kk - monopole induced superpotentials .",
    "these are crucial steps for obtaining the correct 3d dualities . in the next section",
    "we perform explicitly above procedure .",
    "in this section we consider the duality between the @xmath10 sqcd with @xmath40 fundmental flavors and an adjoint matter .",
    "we first review the 4d and 3d dualities shrotly and study the non - perturbative superpotential arising from putting these 4d theories on a circle .",
    "after that we will derive the 3d duality from the 4d duality .      the 4d duality with an adjoint matter is known as the kutasov - shiwimmer duality @xcite .",
    "the electric side is a four - dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetric @xmath9 gauge theory with @xmath40 fundamental flavors @xmath41 and one adjoint matter @xmath28 with the superpotential @xmath42 .",
    "the magnetic theory is a four - dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetric @xmath43 gauge theory with @xmath40 flavors @xmath44 , one adjoint matter @xmath45 and singlets @xmath46 with the superpotential @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are the meson fields identified with the operators on the electric side as @xmath49 .",
    "we can easily obtain the @xmath10 duality by gauging the @xmath34 baryon flavor symmetry . since in 4d the dynamics of the @xmath50",
    "are ir free , then it does not affect the seiberg duality .",
    "the three - dimensional counterpart of the kutasov - schwimmer duality is known as the kim - park duality @xcite .",
    "electric \" theory is the three - dimensional @xmath13 supersymmetric @xmath10 gauge theory with @xmath40 fundamental vector - like matters @xmath51 and an adjoint matter @xmath28 and with the superpotential @xmath52 .",
    "this theory is simply given by the dimensional reduction of the electric side of the kutasov - schwimmer duality .",
    "the  magnetic \" theory is the three - dimensional @xmath13 supersymmetric @xmath53 gauge theory with @xmath40 fundamental vector - like matters @xmath54 and an adjoint matter @xmath45 and the singlet @xmath55 and @xmath56 with the superpotential @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the minimal bare monopole operators of electric side and magnetic side respectively . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the monopole operators dressed by the adjoint matter .",
    "the coulomb branches of the electric side are described by the elementary chiral superfields in the magnetic side .",
    "the global charges are summarized as follows , which is applicable in the 4d theory except for the monopole operators .",
    "we keep the r - charges generic .",
    "note that @xmath48 are identified with the operator in the electric side as @xmath62 and we listed the four dimensional instanton factors for a later purpose .",
    "these instantons only appear in the 4d theories .",
    ".quantum numbers of the kim - park duality [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the superpotential is @xmath63 the monopole operators at high energy should be identified as follows .",
    "@xmath64 in addition to the above superpotential we have the affleck - harvey - witten type superpotential @xcite which is generated by the gauge symmetry breaking @xmath65 : @xmath66 putting these into the superpotential we obtain the dual ( mirror ) theory , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is absorbed by the field rescaling .",
    "this is precisely in accord with with the result obtained by the un - gauging technique @xcite .    0",
    "here we compare this dual theory with the result obtained by un - gauging [ ] .",
    "by un - gauging we have the magnetic theory : @xmath69 gauge theory with cs coupling between @xmath20 and @xmath70 with @xmath40 flavors @xmath44 , an adjoint @xmath45 and singlets @xmath71 with the superpotential @xmath72 we have the coulomb branches about @xmath20 and @xmath73 which are described by @xmath74 .",
    "the chiral superfield    in our magnetic theory , th",
    "in this paper we derived the duality of the three - dimensional @xmath13 supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath40 fundamental matters and one adjoint matter with a superpotential @xmath52 from the four - dimensional kutasov - schwimmer duality .",
    "we especially concentrated on @xmath10 , @xmath9 gauge groups and the dualities obtained here were the ones which are given by @xcite . while in @xcite the dualities were constructed by the generalization of the aharony duality and by the un - gauging technique respectively , we offered the alternative derivation of these dualities in this paper .",
    "the duality for the @xmath10 with an adjoint matter was derived in a similar way of the derivation of the aharony duality from the 4d @xmath10 seiberg duality @xcite .",
    "hence , the superpotential from the kk - monopoles , affleck - harvey - witten and the xyz model from the @xmath75 part play a crucial role to modify the coulomb branch on the magnetic side . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath9 duality with an adjoint matter is derived in a same way as the @xmath10 case , where we used the @xmath13 mirror symmetry which is the generalization of the duality between the sqed with @xmath76 and the xyz model , which makes the coulomb branch of the dual gauge theory lifted together with the affleck - harvey - witten type superpotential .",
    "it would be worth analyzing the derivation in this paper without the weak perturbation for the adjoint matters @xmath28 and @xmath45 , in which we will have to include the dynamics of the non - abelian gauge group @xmath77 for the @xmath9 duality and @xmath78 for the @xmath10 duality . in deriving the duality we assumed that the @xmath79 part does not enhance to @xmath77 in the limit of @xmath80 for @xmath9 . in the @xmath10 cases we relied on the similar assumption .",
    "this was only the working assumption that discarding the off - diagonal part of the adjoint fields would not be important for deriving dualities , hence it should be investigated more carefully .",
    "it would be also worth considering other gauge groups , for example @xmath81 , @xmath12 and @xmath82 with an adjoint matter .",
    "it is important to extend the procedure of deriving the 3d dualities from 4d to the dualities with various matter fields as @xcite ( see @xcite for examples of the 4d dualities ) . in @xcite",
    "the symmetric tensor matter or anti - symmetric tensor matter are added to the 4d dualities and the chiral theories are also considered .",
    "it is interesting to study the corresponding 3d dualities .",
    "although the procedure to obtain the 3d dualities is the same as ones in @xcite and in this paper , it would be more and more subtle because the structure of the coulomb branch becomes complicated . to obtain the 3d dualities",
    ", it is necessary to match the monopole operators at high- and low - energy theory when we turn on the real masses and take the low energy limit and it is very subtle task .",
    "this extension is left as a future work .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "ofer aharony , itamar shamir , and prof .",
    "tadakatsu sakai for helpful discussions .",
