    "the inflationary paradigm@xcite proposed around @xmath6 was a giant leap towards going beyond the standard model of big - bang cosmology . since then there has been a plethora of inflationary models and it is still increasing @xcite .",
    "however , with the high precision observational cosmology @xcite , any cosmological model building will have to take care of strong observational constraints . by",
    "now inflation has become an integral part of the modern theoretical cosmology .",
    "it is an exponential expansion at the very early stage of our universe .",
    "so far this is the only mechanism which can successfully generate all the suitable initial boundary conditions for the standard big - bang cosmology .",
    "as mentioned before , there exists a large class of models which predict required inflationary observables within the experimental bounds .",
    "particularly , a recently discovered inflationary @xmath7 attractor @xcite gained a significant attentions because of its unification of a large class of models .",
    "in this paper we will introduce new classes of inflationary scenarios extending one of the present authors current work on minimal higgs inflation @xcite . in this class of models we consider a very simple modification of the usual power law potential by incorporating an inflation scale such that it generates a flat plateau for infinite range of inflaton field value .",
    "we may think of these form of the potentials as a small dip over a cosmological constant set by the aforementioned inflationary energy scale .",
    "therefore , it could be very generic in the sense that it does not need extreme fine - tunning to get such a form of the potential . only tunning we have to make",
    "is to model the form of the dip .",
    "however , we believe as well as our subsequent analysis shows that form of the dip will not have significant effect at least on the inflationary observables .",
    "it is the infinite flat plateau which plays the main role to trigger the inflation . depending upon the form of the dip , dynamics after the inflation or more specifically reheating prediction will be different .",
    "therefore , infinite class of models can be constructed by changing the form of the dip . in the recent paper on minimal",
    "higgs inflation @xcite , two different kind of form of the dip has been taken in compatible with the the usual higgs potential and found the models fit extremely well with the cosmological observations . in this paper",
    "we generalize further the form of the dip in compatible with the general power law potential and study in detail their predictions during inflation .",
    "we also study the evolution after the end of inflation , specifically focusing on reheating period . in this paper",
    "we mainly study the perturbative evolution of all the important components of the universe . out of all the components we specifically focus on the heavy dark matter production and constrain the parameter space based on the present dark matter abundance .",
    "the current observational data shows that most of the cold matters in our universe are non - baryonic @xcite , and weakly interacting @xcite .",
    "importantly , direct and indirect probe to detect dark matter in the lower mass range has been inconclusive so far .",
    "hence , it is quite natural to look for dark matter in the heavy mass range , where it is termed as the super - heavy dark matter@xcite .",
    "such a massive particle is very difficult to produce with the current experimental set up because of kinematics .",
    "however , reheating phenomena after the inflation is believed to be an important mechanism which can produce such a massive particle .",
    "therefore , in the cosmological context we can look for indirect evidence of such a heavy dark matter through small scale non - gaussianities in the cmb or even in ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the produced mass of the dark matter crucially depends on its production mechanism . for thermal production simple kinematics does not allow the production of dark matter with mass greater than equilibrium",
    "temperature@xmath8 . however , it has long been identified that during reheating , the equilibrium temperature @xmath9 is not the maximum temperature of the universe after inflation @xcite and as a consequence particles of mass larger than the reheating temperature can be produced@xcite .",
    "the mass limit can be further extended if we allow the dark matter production via direct decay of inflaton @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will generalize the existing mechanism of heavy dark matter production for arbitrary equation of state @xmath10 of the oscillating inflaton .",
    "we structured our paper as follows : in section - i , we introduce in detail the form of the potential and their behavior .",
    "we study inflationary dynamics and corresponding conditions for the inflation .",
    "all those conditions , which one generally calls slow roll parameters , will play important roll on the evolution of the cosmological perturbation . by using those we compute three important cosmological observables which are scalar spectral index @xmath11 , the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath12 , and the spectral running @xmath13",
    ". we also considered the behavior of those parameters in terms of model parameter .",
    "after the end of inflation , generically the inflaton starts to have coherent oscillation at the minimum of the potential , which we call re - heating phase of the universe . without explicitly considering the detail mechanism of reheating , one can figure out the possible range of re - heating temperature @xmath8 , and constrain the evolution of scale factor parametrized by efolding number @xmath14 during re - heating period , by observing the background evolution of observable scales and entropy density . in section - ii",
    ", we will consider the aforementioned evolutions of scales and entropy density to constrain further our models .",
    "in section - iii , we study in detail the dynamics of the oscillatory phase of inflaton and study perturbative re - hearting phase . specifically focusing on the heavy dark matter particle production ,",
    "we have solved a set of boltzmann equations for the coupled system of inflaton , radiation and the matter field with different inflaton equation of state during late time reheating phase . assuming the produced heavy particle to be a part of the total dark matter we see today",
    ", we set the upper limit on the value of dark matter annihilation cross - section with respect to the mass and reheating temperature .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , we will model the dip part of the potential by the power law form . however , it has to have smooth connection with the flat infinite plateau as one increases the inflaton field value .",
    "therefore , we suggest the following simple forms of the potential , v ( ) =     + ,    in the above form of the potentials , we have introduced two free parameters @xmath15 .",
    "where , the parameter @xmath16 is defined for @xmath17 , which has been studied as minimal higgs inflation @xcite . for other value of @xmath2",
    ", we can set @xmath18 . as has been advertised",
    ", we can think of above potentials as dip in the background of cosmological constants set by @xmath19 . a simple illustration of the above form of the potentials is shown the fig.[potential ] . through out the paper",
    ", we will refer type - i for first form of above potential and type - ii for the second form .",
    "of course one important generalization of our model can be done by considering the potential to be dependent only upon the modulus of the inflaton field .",
    "therefore , all the odd values of @xmath2 can be included .",
    "however , our analysis through out the paper will be valid for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we will stick to only even values of @xmath2 .",
    "another simple generalization of our model one can do is by defining @xmath20 as a new potential .    , for @xmath21      in this section we will study in detail the background dynamics using the above potential form",
    ". we will start with the following action , s  =   d^4x [ action ] where @xmath22 is the reduced planck mass . assuming the usual friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) background ansatz for the space - time ds^2 = dt^2 - a(t)^2 ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) , [ frw ] the system of equations governing the inflationary dynamics in the above background and the dynamics of the scalar field are 3m_p^2 h^2= ^2 + v",
    "( ) + 2m_p^2 = -^2 + + 3 h + v ( ) .",
    "[ friedman ] where , the usual definition of hubble constant is @xmath23 .",
    "as we have seen , our potential has a very flat plateau away from the dip .",
    "therefore , flatness condition which is required for the inflationary dynamics is automatically satisfied for our potential .",
    "the flatness conditions for the potential during inflation are called slow - roll parameters , which are defied as ( ) ^2 & = &     +     + m_p^2 ( ) & = &     +    [ eq - slow - roll ] inflation occurs when @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as one can easily see , the inflation should end near the dip of the potential .",
    "however , the precise location of the end of inflation is usually set by the condition @xmath26 .",
    "let us also define a higher order slow - roll parameter related to the third derivative of the potential for our later purpose .",
    "the expression for the higher order slow - roll parameter is as follows : m_p^4 ( ) =     +    in addition to provide the successful inflation , we will see how all the aforementioned slow - roll parameters control the dynamics of cosmological perturbation in the inflationary background .",
    "the idea of inflation was first to solve the so - called horizon and flatness problem in the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "an important cosmological parameter which quantify the amount of inflation is called e - folding number @xmath27 . the e - folding number which is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the scale factors at the beginning and at the end of inflation ,",
    "can be written as n = ln ( ) = _ a_in^a_end d lna = _",
    "t_in^t_end h dt [ efold ] in the slow - roll regime one can use hdt = = [ efold2 ] as we have mentioned the inflation ends when @xmath26 , and one can use the eq.([efold ] ) to find the beginning of the inflation .",
    "now by using the eqs.([efold]-[efold2 ] ) , we can express the the efolding number into the following form , @xmath28 &   \\simeq \\frac{\\phi_*^2}{n m_p^2 } \\frac{1}{(n+2 ) } \\tilde{\\phi}^{(n+2 ) } \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\phi_*^2}{n m_p^2 } \\left[\\frac{1}{4 } ( \\tilde{\\phi}^4-\\phi_{end}^4 ) + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\tilde{\\phi}^2-\\phi_{end}^2)\\right ] & \\simeq \\frac{\\phi_*^2}{4 n m_p^2 } \\tilde{\\phi}^4 ,         \\end{cases }         \\label{efold3}\\ ] ] where we have defined , @xmath29 . in the right hand side of the above approximate expression for @xmath30 ,",
    "we have ignored the contribution coming from @xmath31 , and also squared term .",
    "we have numerically checked the validity of those expressions for a wide range of value of @xmath32 of cosmological interest . from the observational constraint one needs @xmath33 in order to make the largest scales observed in cmb to be in causal contact before the inflation .",
    "we have all the necessary mathematical expressions to solve for the background inflationary dynamics .",
    "one particular solution has been given in fig.[mi - rhovaplot ] , with a specific value of the efolding number .",
    "once we solve for the background , in the next sections we will do cosmological perturbation analysis , and derive the relevant cosmological parameters as has been described in the introduction .      as we have explained in detail in the introduction , the very idea of inflation",
    "was devised to solve some outstanding problems of standard big - bang cosmology .",
    "soon it was realized that inflation also provides seed for large - scale structure formation via quantum fluctuation on the inflationary background .",
    "this remarkable fact gives the inflationary theory a solid basis .",
    "all the cosmologically relevant inflationary observables are essentially identified with various correlation function of those primordial fluctuations calculated in the framework of quantum field theory . in cosmological perturbation theory the most general form the perturbations on the inflationary background eq.([frw ] ) can be expressed as ( x , t ) & = & _ 0(t ) + ( x , t ) , + ds^2 & = & ( 1 + 2 ) dt^2 + 2 a ( _ i b + b_i)dx_i dt + a^2(1 - 2)_ij dx_i dx_j + & + & ( 2 _ i _ j e + 2 _ ( ie_j ) + h_ij)dx_i dx_j , where , the perturbed fields satisfy the following transverse and traceless gauge conditions , _",
    "i h^ij = 0  ;  _ ij h^ij = 0  ;  ^i b_i = ^i e_i=0 .",
    "therefore , we have ten metric perturbation components , however , only two of them will be dynamical because of general coordinate invariance .",
    "those two are the component of tensor metric perturbation @xmath35 , which are gauge invariant .",
    "in addition we have one scalar degrees of freedom which is the inflaton field . by using the diffeomorphism invariance",
    ", one can identify the gauge invariant scalar perturbation @xcite : - . in the literature ,",
    "we call it as co - moving curvature perturbation",
    ". two point correlation function of this curvature perturbation is known as primordial power spectrum .",
    "this is the fluctuation which turned into density perturbation after their horizon exit , and produce all large scale structure that we see through the gravitational instability after their horizon re - entry . in order to compute the correlation function , necessary quadratic action for curvature perturbation will look like , s_(2 ) = d^4 x a^3 .",
    "evaluating the power spectrum from this action is standard ( see , @xcite for a comprehensive review of cosmological perturbation theory ) , and it is given by = |_k = ah = .",
    "once , we know the power spectrum , cosmological quantity of our interests are the spectral tilt and its running . during inflation",
    "a particular inflaton field value corresponds to a particular momentum mode exiting the horizon .",
    "hence by using the following relation to the leading order in slow - roll parameters , @xmath36 , one obtains the following inflationary observables , n_s-1 = -6 + 2 dn_s^k = -2 + 16 - 24 ^2 . in a similar manner , we can also compute quadratic action for the gauge invariant tenor perturbation @xmath35 and compute its power spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "standard practice is to define a the tensor - to - scalar ratio r = = 16once we have all the expression for cosmological quantities in terms of slow roll parameters , by using eqs.([eq - slow - roll],[efold3 ] ) , and considering @xmath38 in unit of @xmath39 , we express @xmath34 in terms of @xmath2,@xmath30 and @xmath40 , as 1 - n_s & = &     +    ;  dn_s^k =    - + -     + r & = &    8n^2 ( ) ^ +    [ ns - r - r ] we have also numerically checked all the above approximate expressions . from the above analytic expressions for the @xmath34 ,",
    "some general but important comments are as follows . for type - ii class of models",
    ", we see that the value of @xmath41 are insensitive to the value of @xmath2 or on the dimension of the potential . this fact can also bee seen from the fig.([fig - rvlogalpha ] ) , where , no approximation has been done .",
    "in particular one notices that for @xmath42 , value of @xmath43 start to deviate form each other for different value of @xmath2 .",
    "however , in general value of @xmath44 to the leading order .",
    "therefore , form the planck observation considering the upper bound of @xmath45 , we can constrain the upper limit of @xmath2 for a fixed value of @xmath32 . as",
    "one understands from this fact that from the current observation , it is difficult to uniquely fix the form of the potential .",
    "therefore , we need more theoretical inputs to figure out the full form of the potential . for type - i models ,",
    "all quantities are dependent on @xmath2 , which can also be seen from fig.([fig - nsvlogalpha ] ) .",
    "however , an important fact emerges in the limit @xmath46 for these type of models .",
    "if we take the aforementioned limit , the expression of @xmath47 for the type - i model reduce to 1-n_s ;   r 8 ( ) ^2  ;  dn_s^k = - , which can be identified as a particular model within the class of recently proposed ` @xmath7-attractor ' models @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a wide range of parameter values , we have infinite possibilities namely for @xmath48 , which predict all the cosmological parameters within the planck bound @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of particular importance to study their uv completion , specifically the supergravity formulation of those form of the potential .",
    "nonetheless , we have numerically checked the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath2 for a particular value of inflationary scale as shown in fig.([fig - nsvn ] ) . as on observes , from eq.([ns - r - r ] ) , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 as @xmath46 .",
    "this is also clearly seen from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 in the fig.([fig - nsvn ] ) +",
    ".the spectral quantities for different values of @xmath2 for 50 efolding .",
    "the two values of @xmath40 are chosen to illustrate that we can have both small field and large field inflation depending on the value of @xmath40 .",
    "the general trend for the variation of these quantities with @xmath40 is illustrated in the figures ( [ fig - nsvlogalpha]-[fig - rvlogalpha ] ) [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      +      in order to understand the the dynamics of all the component during reheating , we will first numerically solve boltzmann equation for a particular choice of parameter values . as we have seen from the reheating analysis ,",
    "depending upon the equation of state , and within the experimental limit of the scalar spectral index , reheating temperature could be from @xmath52 gev all the way up to @xmath53 gev .",
    "therefore , we assume , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which would result in @xmath57 , the value of @xmath58 can be found from the relation ( [ tre ] ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath59 at some arbitrary time during oscillatory period . with these choice of parameters",
    "the results are shown in the figure.([fig - particle1 ] ) . as we noted that the reheating temperature is not the maximum temperature in the radiation era and the maximum temperature",
    "is reached before the radiation domination begins . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we have checked that for reheating temperature @xmath60 the maximum temperature @xmath61 gev and similarly for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the value of maximum temperature decreases slightly as we increase the value of @xmath2 .",
    "we have mentioned two possible ways of producing the @xmath64 particle .",
    "we see that changing @xmath65 and keeping @xmath9 fixed , the particle production get enhanced due to the direct production @xmath66 .",
    "this effect is evident from the presence of a second plateau in the curves for the evolution of x - particle energy density ( dotted line for @xmath67 and dot - dashed line for @xmath68 ) .",
    "even , for reheating temperature lower than @xmath69gev , the production via radiation is negligible and the direct production is the predominant one .",
    "we also note that the difference between the two production processes became lesser prominent as we increase @xmath0 .",
    "another important point we must mention is that , in deriving the analytic estimate for @xmath70 , we have assumed @xmath71 , in our numerical calculations we have checked the validity for the assumption for all the values of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical values of the quantities for different values of @xmath2 are given in the table ( [ xtable ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the table-([xtable ] ) that the production of the dark matter particle decreases as we increase @xmath2 .",
    "it is also observed that for @xmath72 , we will not have radiation dominated universe after the reheating phase for @xmath73 gev .",
    "we arrived at this conclusion for a specific set of parameter values .",
    "therefore , we ask the question of what should be the allowed parameter region for a specific reheating temperature so that our stable heavy x - dark matter particle freezes out at a value such that after evolution it provides us the lower or equal to the dark matter abundance we see today .",
    "therefore , we have scan the parameter space of the dark matter annihilation cross section @xmath4 and its mass @xmath74 for a fixed reheating temperature taking reference of the current dark matter abundance .",
    "to put a bound we will use second form of eq.([abundance ] ) and this will enable us to write a relation between @xmath75 , @xmath74 and @xmath76 .",
    "the full relation is quite complicated , however we can simply write the relation between the three quantities of importance as follows , @xmath77~ \\text{for $ m_x \\lesssim t_{max}$}\\\\ \\omega_x h^2 & = & d(w ) \\left<\\sigma|v|\\right > m_x^4 exp\\left[-\\frac{e(w)m_x}{t_{max}}\\right]~ \\text{for $ m_x \\gtrsim t_{max}$ } \\label{analytic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants dependent on the equation of state parameter and the reheating parameters such as @xmath80 .",
    "according to the various cosmological observation , the dark matter abundance is measured as @xmath81 @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if we consider this value as an upper limit for our x - particle abundance eq.([analytic ] ) , depending upon different equation of state parameter @xmath0 , we figure out the possible allowed region in fig.([fig - particle1 ] ) . the upper limit on annihilation cross - section @xmath82 is bounded by the red and blue lines coming from unitarity and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the shaded region is allowed . as one observes from the plots ,",
    "if we consider x - particle is the only dark matter candidate , the parameter space is highly constrained by the unitarity limit .",
    "for example , if we consider reheating temperature @xmath84 gev , production of super - heavy dark matter @xmath85 will not be allowed , mainly because of unitarity limit .",
    "as we increase @xmath9 , because of exponentially suppressed production , very narrow range of @xmath74 is allowed for super - heavy x - particle . for",
    "a fixed value of dark matter mass @xmath74 , as one increases @xmath0 , the upper bound on @xmath86 will decrease . as an example , for @xmath84 gev and @xmath87 gev , one finds @xmath88 for equation of state @xmath89 respectively . from fig.[fig - particle1 ] , as one increases the value of @xmath0 , in the low mass regime slope of the solid and dotted blue curves is decreasing .",
    "this fact widens the range of possible dark matter mass range while narrows down the annihilation cross - section .",
    "in the first part of this paper , we have constructed two new classes of inflationary model with non - polynomial modification of the inflaton potential .",
    "interesting property of these class of potential is that they have infinitely large flat plateau with a dip at the center in the field space .",
    "naturally the large flat plateau drives the inflation . as a result , the predictions of the models are not very much sensitive to the details of the dip and more importantly fit extremely well with latest cosmological observation made by planck .",
    "all the necessary scales in our models are below planck scale , which may imply that our model predictions are robust and any high energy correction to the observables could be planck scale suppressed .",
    "detailed computation on the ultra - violate effect on our model could be important and we left it for our future work . depending upon the choice of scale , our model can have both large field as well as small field inflation .",
    "however , for both the cases with a wide range of scale , the prediction of tensor to scalar ratio @xmath12 turned out to be significantly small .",
    "another important aspect of our model is that we can have significantly low inflationary hubble scale @xmath90 unlike the prediction of usual power law inflationary model",
    ". the value could be as low as @xmath91 gev for different values of @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "as we had discussed , low value fo @xmath90 could be interesting in the context of higgs vacuum instability .",
    "as has been pointed out in @xcite , during as well as after the inflation the quantum fluctuation of higgs field can destabilize the standard model metastable higgs vacuum at around @xmath94 gev .",
    "however , this instability crucially depends upon the value of @xmath90 , and also the height of the higgs potential .",
    "therefore , comparing the naive scale dependence between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , our model have potential to save the higgs vacuum from decaying into the global vacuum .",
    "we leave detail study for our future work .    since we have discussed about the possible interesting interplay between our model and the higgs field at high energy scale",
    ", it would be of particular interest to understand the potential application of our model in the particle physics context .",
    "this is what motivates us to study the possible connection and constraints of our models specifically in the context of heavy dark matter production during the reheating period . after the end of inflation",
    ", reheating is the stage during which all the matter fields are produced .",
    "usual strategy is to consider the effective coupling among inflaton and various other matter fields we see today . in this paper",
    "we have specifically concentrated on the perturbative reheating phenomena .",
    "near the origin the inflaton potential behaves like a power law @xmath97 , therefore , coherently oscillating inflaton can be well approximated as an effective fluid with the equation of state parameter , @xmath98 . with the usual pure power law potential , one finds it very difficult to fit the cosmological observation for even @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , detailed study have not been done for general power law potential specifically in the context of reheating . however , as we have advertised through out our paper , with the non - polynomial generalization we can easily have power law form of the inflaton potential specifically at the bottom of the dip where the inflaton coherently oscillates .",
    "this fact leads us to generalize the known analysis of the perturbative reheating @xcite for general effective inflaton equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "hence , we first tried to analytically study the boltzmann equations for the evolution of inflaton , radiation and a massive dark matter field for generic @xmath0 . furthermore , we compared our analytic study with the full numerical solutions for specific form of the potential of our interest .",
    "we have found some interesting behavior such as the existence of minimum extraction of energy from the inflaton field for @xmath100 .",
    "it could be interesting to understand this fact better and constrain the reheating period if any .",
    "however , our main focus was to study the production of heavy dark matter particle with mass @xmath101 .",
    "as there is no observational evidence of light dark matter so far , the heavy dark matter phenomenology could be interesting to explore@xcite .",
    "the reheating mechanism is not fully explored and ill understood because of its non - linearity .",
    "however it is assumed to have huge potential to explain many particle physics as well as cosmological problems starting from baryogenesis , dark matter , neutrino mass and their properties . however , in this paper we concentrated on heavy dark matter production .",
    "we constrained the dark matter annihilation cross - section ( @xmath102 ) as a function of its mass @xmath74 considering the present dark matter abundance @xmath103 as an upper limit .",
    "if we consider single component dark matter , parameter space is tightly constrained .",
    "for example , if one considers low reheating temperature such as @xmath104 gev , we can not have production of super - heavy dark matter of mass @xmath105 gev . as we increase the equation of state @xmath0 ,",
    "the region of parameter space is shrinks .",
    "it would interesting study in details these link between the equation of state of the inflaton and the heavy dark matter particle .",

    "<S> the modification is done by introducing a single scale creating an infinite plateau for large inflaton field value . </S>",
    "<S> one can identify those class of potentials as a small dip at the origin of a constant one dimensional field space . because of this large flat plateau , we find all the predictions are fitting extremely well with the recent observations made by planck . </S>",
    "<S> we have extensively studied perturbative reheating phenomena specifically focusing on the production of dark matter heavier than the reheating temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the well known analysis of heavy dark matter production for general equation of state @xmath0 of the oscillating inflaton field . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the end we consider effective equation of state @xmath1 emerging form our model . </S>",
    "<S> where , @xmath2 is the index of the power law potential during late time oscillatory phase . considering present value of the dark matter abundance @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the parameter space of annihilation cross - section ( @xmath4 ) and mass @xmath5 of a single component dark matter for different reheating temperature and equation of state @xmath0 . </S>"
