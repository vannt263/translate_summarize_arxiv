    "the idea of universality plays a major role in the modern understanding of critical phenomena .",
    "all the physical systems undergoing a continuous phase transition are believed to fall in a certain number of universality classes , depending on the dimensionality of the system and its symmetry group , but not on the details of the microscopic interactions ( as long as these are short  ranged ) .",
    "all the systems in a given universality class display the same critical behavior , meaning that certain dimensionless quantities have the same value for all the physical systems in a given class .",
    "critical indices and universal amplitude ratios are examples of these universal quantities .    for gauge theories with a high temperature deconfinement transition ,",
    "the universality hypothesis takes the form of the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture , @xcite , which can be formulated as follows : suppose a @xmath6dimensional gauge theory with gauge group @xmath7 has a second  order deconfinement transition at a certain temperature @xmath8 ; consider the @xmath9dimensional statistical model with global symmetry group coinciding with the center of the gauge group : if also this model displays a second  order phase transition , then the two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "the validity of the conjecture has been well established in several monte carlo analyses ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for the case we are interested in here , namely @xmath10 and @xmath11 , a precise numerical test of the svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the most obvious application of universality arguments , and in particular of the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture , is the prediction of the critical indices .",
    "for example , consider @xmath1 gauge theory ; it undergoes a high  temperature deconfinement transition which is known to be second  order in both three and four space  time dimensions .",
    "the center of @xmath1 is @xmath12 , therefore the dimensionally reduced statistical model is the ising model , which has a second  order phase transition both in @xmath11 and @xmath13 . hence the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture applies , and we can predict the critical indices of the @xmath1 deconfinement transition in @xmath6 dimensions to coincide with the ones of the ising model in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "however , the predictive power of universality is certainly not limited to the values of the critical indices . in ref.@xcite",
    "a program has been initiated of systematic exploitation of universality arguments in studying the non  perturbative physics of gauge theories .",
    "for example , it was shown that non ",
    "trivial results on finite  size effects and correlation functions at the deconfinement point can be obtained from universality arguments . in this way it has been possible to evaluate exactly the expectation value of the plaquette operator in presence of static sources , giving some new insight into the structure of the color flux tube for mesons and baryons .    in this paper",
    "we continue the program by analysing the finite  size scaling behavior of the plaquette operator in @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory at the deconfinement temperature . since the @xmath2 ising model is exactly solved , the svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture gives in this case exact predictions on finite ",
    "size scaling effects .",
    "we write down these predictions for the expectation value of the plaquette operator and we compare them with monte carlo results . the same analysis was performed in ref.@xcite for @xmath12 gauge theory .",
    "the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture can be seen as a mapping between observables of the @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory at finite temperature and operators of the @xmath2 ising model . the polyakov loop is mapped into the magnetization , while the plaquette operator is mapped into a linear combination of the identity and the energy operators of the statistical model @xcite : @xmath14 where the expectation value in the l.h.s . is taken in the gauge theory , while the ones in the r.h.s .",
    "refer to the two  dimensional ising model .",
    "the dots represent contributions from secondary fields in the conformal families of the identity and energy operators , whose contributions are subleading for asymptotically large lattices .",
    "the finite  size dependence of the energy expectation value in the two  dimensional ising model on a torus is @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the area and the modular parameter of the torus .",
    "@xmath18 is the partition function of the ising model at the critical point : @xmath19 ( we follow the notations of ref.@xcite for the jacobi theta functions @xmath20 and the dedekind function @xmath21 ) .",
    "consider now @xmath0 @xmath1 lattice gauge theory regularized on a @xmath22 lattice , with @xmath23 .",
    "for a given @xmath24 the gauge coupling @xmath25 can be tuned to a critical value @xmath26 to simulate the theory at the finite temperature deconfinement phase transition .",
    "precise evaluations of @xmath26 for various values of @xmath24 are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the universality argument gives us the following prediction for the finite  size scaling behavior of the plaquette operator at the deconfinement point @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a function of the modular parameter @xmath17 only : @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are non ",
    "universal constants which depend on @xmath24 and must be determined numerically .",
    "once these have been determined , eq .",
    "( [ fseplaq ] ) predicts the expectation value of the plaquette operator for all sizes and shapes of the lattice , _ i.e. _ for all values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 corrections represent the contribution of secondary fields .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ fseplaq ] ) is valid asymptotically for large lattices .",
    "once the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been determined at a given value of @xmath24 , for example through the finite  size scaling analysis presented here , all the correlation functions of the plaquette operator at criticality are in principle exactly computable , since they can be readily derived from the corresponding correlators of the energy operator in the @xmath35 ising model .",
    "consider for example the plaquette expectation value in presence of static sources , _",
    "i.e. _ the correlation function of the plaquette with @xmath36 polyakov loops : @xmath37 this is the typical quantity to study if one is interested in the structure of the color flux tube , since it represents the density of action in presence of external sources .",
    "universality then tells us that the connected part of @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where the correlator on the r.h.s .",
    "is computed in the critical @xmath2 ising model , @xmath40 is the spin operator and @xmath41 is the constant which relates it to the polyakov loop ; @xmath41 can be determined with methods similar to the ones we used here to determine @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture , together with the exact results of @xmath2 conformal field theory , gives us complete control over the critical behavior of @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory at the finite temperature deconfinement transition .",
    "more generally , this holds for every @xmath0 gauge theory whose deconfinement transition is second  order , including @xmath42 .",
    "some studies of the flux  tube structure following this line were presented in ref .",
    "three  dimensional finite temperature gauge theories are simulated by using @xmath43 lattices with @xmath44 .",
    "we have performed our simulations of @xmath1 pure gauge theory with @xmath45 and @xmath46 varying between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and modular parameter @xmath49 between 1 and 3 .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic in all three directions . for each value of @xmath24",
    "we have chosen the coupling @xmath26 corresponding to the deconfinement transition point : from ref.@xcite we have @xmath50 the only free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ fseplaq ] ) are the non  universal constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which depend on the value on @xmath24 and on the kind of plaquette we are considering ( time  like or space  like ) .",
    "therefore we have a total of four sets of data to be compared with the theoretical prediction : for each of these sets we can perform a two  parameter fit with eq .",
    "( [ fseplaq ] ) .",
    "it turns out however that finite  size effects on space  like plaquettes are of the same order of magnitude than the typical statistical uncertainties of our simulations .",
    "therefore from now on we will consider time  like plaquettes only .",
    "it is important to stress that for each value of @xmath24 all the data , corresponding to different values of @xmath51 , are included in the same two ",
    "parameter fit .",
    "specifically , for each lattice with sides @xmath52 we define an `` effective area '' @xmath53 so that eq .",
    "( [ fseplaq ] ) becomes @xmath54 and we can fit the plaquette expectation value to a linear function of @xmath55 .    the monte carlo results for the plaquette expectation values are reported in tab.1 and tab.2 while the results of the fits for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are reported in tab.3 .",
    "the values of the reduced @xmath58 show that the agreement is very satisfactory . in figs . 1 and 2 the plaquette expectation values are plotted against @xmath55 together with the best fit line .",
    "the same data are plotted against @xmath59 in fig . 3 for @xmath56 .",
    "this shows the crucial importance of including the non  trivial part of eq .",
    "( [ fseplaq ] ) , namely its @xmath60dependence .",
    "the same analysis was performed in ref.@xcite for @xmath0 @xmath12 gauge theory , whose finite temperature deconfinement transition is also in the universality class of the @xmath2 ising model .",
    "reported in ref.@xcite for @xmath12 gauge theory are negative : this is due to the fact that the simulation was actually performed in the @xmath0 spin ising model , using @xmath0 duality .",
    "as a consequence , the svetitsky - yaffe mapping between @xmath0 observables and @xmath2 ising operators at criticality includes a duality transformation , which changes the sign of @xmath61 . ]",
    "we have shown that the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture , _",
    "i.e. _ universality applied to the deconfinement transition , provides an exact description of finite  size effects for @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory at the deconfinement point .",
    "this description is obtained by mapping the gauge theory into the @xmath2 ising model , which is in the same universality class , and is exactly solved .",
    "we have compared the predictions obtained from this mapping with monte carlo results , finding complete agreement .",
    "the main motivation for this work was not to verify the validity of the svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture , which is by now well established .",
    "our intent is rather to stress that universality arguments provide a powerful , analytical approach to a deeply non  perturbative region , namely the deconfinement transition and its neighborhood .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath0 gauge theories , since critical behavior in @xmath2 is completely understood with the techniques of conformal field theory .",
