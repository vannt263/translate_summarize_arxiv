    "game theory was developed in the 1940s as a mathematical tool to study interactions and decisions of rational agents @xcite . for a long time",
    "it was mainly applied in economics ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) . in the 1970s ,",
    "it was introduced to biology via the concept of biological fitness and natural selection @xcite and the evolutionary game theory enabled to study infinite homogeneous populations via replicator equations @xcite .",
    "recently , dynamics in populations which are finite and spatially structured ( the structure being represented by graphs ) attracted a lot of attention @xcite . evolutionary game theory on graphs has shown that the rate of cooperation strongly depends on the structure of the underlying interaction graph ( see e.g.  @xcite and numerous following papers ) . at the same time , the similar problem of equilibria selection in cooperation games via timing structures has attracted a lot of attention , both in microeconomics ( e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as in macroeconomics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    mathematically , evolutionary games on graphs are very complex structures which bring together notions from graph theory , game theory , dynamical systems and stochastic processes .",
    "mathematical techniques which are used are therefore complex and include complex approximative techniques like pair and diffusion approximation and voter model perturbations @xcite or are limited to special classes of graphs , e.g. , cycles @xcite , stars @xcite and vertex - transitive graphs @xcite . whereas these papers focus mainly on stochastic updating of vertices , the goal of this paper is to study evolutionary games on graphs with various deterministic update rules in the framework of discrete dynamical systems and formalize the notions of ( autonomous and nonautonomous ) evolutionary games on graphs , attractors , update rules and update orders .",
    "being aware that this approach may look too formal for some , we believe that this approach should help to ( i ) disclose and answer interesting questions ( some of them listed in section [ s : oq ] ) , ( ii ) understand patterns by means of simple examples and counterexamples , ( iii ) describe analytically dynamics on small graphs ( motivated e.g.  by small sizes of agents in cooperation games in macroeconomics @xcite ) and ( iv ) bridge a gap between three seemingly separate mathematical areas : graph theory , game theory and dynamical systems .    in section [ s : egame ] , we introduce , for a given graph and an arbitrary utility function , a new formal notion of an ( autonomous ) evolutionary game on a graph ( definition [ d : evgame ] ) and attractors ( definition [ d : attractor ] ) . in our rigorous approach",
    ", we are trying to follow the spirit of @xcite and @xcite . in section [",
    "s : gt ] we introduce two basic utility functions and relate them to the underlying game - theoretical parameters . in section [ s : kn ] we characterize the attractivity of full defection ( theorem [ t : kn:0 ] ) and full cooperation ( theorem [ t : kn:1 ] ) on complete graphs . on @xmath0-regular graphs we provide only a sufficient condition for attractivity of these states ( theorem [ t : kreg ] ) and show ( in example [ x : cayley ] ) that it is not necessary .",
    "section [ s : nonautonomous ] is devoted to the extension of the notion of an evolutionary game on a graph to the realistic situation that the vertices are not all updated at each time step ( definition [ d : update : order ] ) .",
    "the new notion of nonautonomous evolutionary game on a graph ( definition [ d : nagame ] ) has the structure of a general nonautonomous dynamical system ( definition [ d : nads ] ) .",
    "we also introduce attractors and their basins for nonautonomous evolutionary games ( definitions [ d : na : attractor ] and [ d : nabasin ] ) and relate them to the autonomous case ( remark [ r : consistency ] ) . in section [ s : kn : na ] we provide conditions for attractivity of full defection and full cooperation of nonautonomous evolutionary games .",
    "the conditions are sufficient for non - omitting update orders but also necessary if a sequential update order is considered ( theorem [ t : kn:0:na ] ) .",
    "example [ x : hella:2 ] shows that in general the conditions are not necessary . in section [",
    "s : update : order ] we provide a complete characterization of attractors of evolutionary games on complete graphs for synchronous ( theorem [ t : hd : a ] ) and sequential ( theorem [ t : hd : na ] ) update orders .",
    "in particular , theorem [ t : hd : na](c ) ( together with example [ x : cycle ] ) shows the existence of an attractive cycle . in section [ s :",
