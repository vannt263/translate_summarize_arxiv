    "molecular dynamics ( md ) generates the time evolution of @xmath5 classical mechanical particles by discrete time propagation . almost all",
    "the md are obtained by the `` verlet '' algorithm ( va ) @xcite where a new position @xmath6 of the @xmath7th particle with mass @xmath8 at time @xmath9 is obtained from the force @xmath10 and the two last discrete positions @xmath11 the algorithm is the central - difference expression for the mass times the acceleration of the particle which equals the force @xmath12 , and it appears in the literature with different names ( verlet , leap - frog , velocity verlet , .. ) @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is time reversible and symplectic , and the different reformulations of the algorithm do not change the discrete time evolution and the physics obtained by the va dynamics .",
    "mathematical investigations @xcite have proved the existence of a shadow hamiltonian @xmath1 @xcite for symplectic algorithms . the proof is obtained by an asymptotic expansion , but the series for the shadow hamiltonian does not converge in the general case . for a review of the asymptotic expansion , its convergence and optimal truncation see @xcite . only the harmonic approximation , @xmath13 of the first term in this expansion is known explicitly @xcite . but inclusion of @xmath13 in the traditional obtained zero order energy for md systems with lennard - jones ( lj ) particles reduces the fluctuation in the energy by a factor of hundred for traditional values of @xmath14 @xcite and makes it possible to obtain the shadow energy , @xmath15 of the analytic dynamics with high precision .",
    "the va algorithm deviates , however , from all other algorithms for classical dynamics by that @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the discrete va dynamics for a harmonic oscillator ( ddho ) , which can be solved exactly , reveals that the ddho not only has an asymptotic expansion with an underlying analytic shadow hamiltonian .",
    "but the ddho dynamics also has a @xmath17 which , independent of an existence of an analytic shadow hamiltonian , is conserved step by step during the discrete time evolution . below",
    "we show that this hidden invariance is a general quality of the discrete va dynamics , independent of the existence of a shadow hamiltonian , and that the discrete va dynamics has the same qualities and conserved invariances as analytic newtonian dynamics . in order to prove the existence of a hidden energy invariance we must not make use of any analytic tools .",
    "this might seem to be a hopeless agenda , but on the other hand the exact solution for a discrete harmonic oscillator @xcite makes no use of analyticity and the exact solution has an energy invariance @xmath3 which , in the analytic limit is equal to the energy of analytic newtonian dynamics .",
    "the kinetic energy in analytic dynamics is obtained from the momenta . the positions in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are the only dynamic variables in the discrete va dynamics , i.e. , the momenta , @xmath18 , are not .",
    "consequently , an expression for the total momentum of the system requires a choice of an expression for the momentum @xmath18 of the @xmath19th particle in terms of its positions .",
    "the sentences `` momenta '' , `` energy '' , `` potential energy '' , `` kinetic energy '' , and `` work '' should be given by quotations in discrete va dynamics to underline the fact , that the @xmath5 objects in the discrete dynamics only exercise mutual `` irritations '' , or forces @xmath20 at their positions at the discrete time @xmath21 . with the definition of the momenta @xmath22 it follows immediately from the algorithm that the total momentum and angular momentum are conserved for conservative systems with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "but the momenta and thereby the `` kinetic energies '' appear @xmath24 with the discrete positions and they are not a function of a single set of the discrete positions .",
    "the proof of an invariance , equivalent to the conserved energy in the analytic dynamics is more difficult , but it can be obtained by proving that there exists a hidden `` energy '' invariance , @xmath3 , of the @xmath5 objects dynamics with the change @xmath25 by the discrete step which brings the @xmath5 positions @xmath26 with the forces @xmath27 at time @xmath28 to @xmath29 at @xmath30",
    ".    for simplicity consider @xmath5 particles with equal masses @xmath31 , and with the mass included in the discrete time increment , i.e. with @xmath32 .",
    "a step with discrete dynamics changes the `` kinetic energy '' of the system by @xmath33 and its ability , @xmath34 , to perform a `` work '' , @xmath35 . since the momenta and",
    "thereby the kinetic energy is given by two sets of positions , a change in kinetic energy is given by three consecutive sets of positions .",
    "the proof is obtained by consider two consecutive time steps .",
    "a new set of positions , @xmath29 is obtained at the @xmath36th time step from the two previous sets , @xmath37 , @xmath26 and the forces @xmath27 , by which the change in the `` kinetic energy '' can be defined as @xmath38 the definition of the change in the kinetic energy for discrete va dynamics is consistent with the definition of the momenta , eq .",
    "the forces @xmath27 bring the @xmath5 particles to the positions @xmath29 and with a change in the ability , @xmath39 , to perform a `` work '' , @xmath40 .",
    "for the two steps we define the total change @xmath41 and the discrete dynamics obeys the relation @xmath42    the proof starts by noticing that if one instead of the ( nve ) dynamics , obtained by eq .",
    "( 1 ) with a constant time increment @xmath0 , adjust the @xmath43th time increment @xmath44 so @xmath45 , one obtains a geodesic step ( nvu ) @xcite to the positions @xmath46 which differs from @xmath29 . if @xmath47 is inserted in the verlet algorithm ; eq . ( 1 ) @xmath48 one obtains an expression for @xmath49 at the nvu step at time @xmath28 @xcite @xmath50",
    "i.e. instead of propagating the system the @xmath36th step with the constant time increment @xmath0 , the increment @xmath44 is adjusted to ensure that the system ability to perform a work is unchanged .",
    "the nvu step at time @xmath28 updates the position to @xmath46 and with the geodesic invariance : the constant length of the steps @xcite @xmath51 which is obtained by rearranging and squaring eq .",
    "( 7 ) @xmath52 i.e. with the change in `` kinetic energy '' @xmath53",
    "so the nvu step to @xmath46 obeys @xmath54    we are now able to proof the existence of an `` energy '' invariance ( eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) by the va dynamics , eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "the proof can e.g. be obtained by deriving the difference between the nvu and the nve step at @xmath28 . the new positions @xmath29 and @xmath46",
    "are both obtained from @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but with different time increments . with nve @xmath57",
    "the difference @xmath58 can be obtained from the verlet algorithm , eq .",

    "( 1 ) @xmath60 and eq .",
    "( 5 ) for the discrete dynamics is obtained from eqn .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) .",
    "the change in kinetic energy in discrete dynamics must necessarily be obtained from two consecutive steps and the change in the systems ability to perform a work is consistently obtained from the same sets of positions .",
    "but , by eliminating @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , one obtains an expression for the change in the ability per time step , @xmath61 @xmath62    in the newtonian dynamics the existence of a potential energy state function , @xmath63 , is ensured by that the total work done around any closed circuit from @xmath64 is zero @xcite .",
    "the va dynamics is started from two sets of positions @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the time increment @xmath0 .",
    "the ability to perform a discrete work @xmath67 is also a state function and it plays the same role as the potential energy @xmath63 for analytic newtonian dynamics . consider any discrete closed sequence of positions generated with va dynamics with the time increment @xmath0 and which starts and ends with the same two configuration @xmath68 and @xmath66 . the total change in the kinetic energy is @xmath69 the start ability is @xmath70 , and since all the terms in @xmath71 are zero accordingly to eq . ( 5 ) it implies that @xmath72    the energy invariance @xmath73 is given by the start condition for the discrete dynamics and it differs from the energy invariance of newtonian dynamics .",
    "it is a state function , and due to the discrete dynamics it depends on two consecutive sets of the positions , @xmath74 , instead of the energy invariance in newtonian dynamics which depends on the positions @xmath75 and the momenta @xmath76 at the same time @xmath28 .",
    "the two invariances are , however , equal in the analytic limit @xcite @xmath77 where the term @xmath78 is the @xmath79 from the newtonian dynamics .    the invariance , eq .",
    "( 20 ) does not depend on a convergence of an asymptotic expansion , and it differs also from the shadow energy for the shadow hamiltonian by that , although the change contains two terms , the expressions for their changes do not make use of a potential , but only of the forces and the discrete positions .",
    "it is obtained by noticing that , with a suitable definition of the `` work '' and kinetic energy , @xmath80 , and by formulating the requirement that @xmath81 is a state function .",
    "the derivation is a copy of the derivation of the energy invariance for newtonian dynamics @xcite . in thermodynamics the first law of thermodynamics",
    "is formulated exactly in the same manner , but as a basic assumption of that the energy function is a state function consisting of two terms which change by work and kinetic energy exchanges , and the present formulations is the corresponding formulation of the energy conservation in dynamics and thermodynamics for discrete va dynamics .",
    "the formulation of energy in discrete va dynamics by the ability @xmath67 to perform a discrete work instead of the potential energy @xmath63 works equally well as the traditional formulation .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations with va for @xmath5 particles are obtained from two consecutive start sets of positions , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and these positions define not only the total dynamics evolution , but also the mean value of traditional zero order energy , @xmath82 , the accurate first order estimate of the shadow energy , @xmath83 of the underlying analytic dynamics and the exact energy invariance @xmath3 .",
    "since the change in @xmath3 is given in the same manner as the energy conservation by the first law of thermodynamics , we need to define a `` start ability '' , @xmath84 for the discrete dynamics .",
    "but the discrete va dynamics differs in fact neither from the analytic counterpart at this point . in principle we could obtain the ability @xmath84 at the start of the simulation by determining the discrete work performed by bringing the particles from infinite separations via @xmath65 to the positions @xmath66 . in the thermodynamics",
    "one defines , however , a standard state of energy ( enthalpy ) , and here we will use the potential energy @xmath85 at the positions @xmath86 and the accurate estimate , @xmath87 at the start of the dynamics , and obtain @xmath88 and the energy invariance @xmath89\\ ] ] with @xmath90 the energy evolution by md in double precision arithmetic with va was determined for two systems . in the first a liquid system of @xmath91 lj particles at the density @xmath92 was calibrated at the temperature @xmath93 .",
    "the thermostat @xcite was switched off and the energy evolution in the next ten thousand time steps with @xmath94 was obtained .",
    "figure 1 shows the energy evolution @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the first hundred time steps .",
    "the first order estimate of @xmath97 ( green dashes ) improves the accuracy of the energy determination with a factor of hundred , the energy invariance @xmath3 is exact ( see inset ) .",
    "the constant va dynamics is obtained from two sets of positions , @xmath98 and @xmath0 and these start values can not contain information about whether the system is in equilibrium or not . in order to obtain the evolution of the kinetic energy @xmath99 and the ability @xmath100 in a non - equilibrium system with va dynamics",
    "a system was started with two sets of positions which correspond to a non - equilibrium state .",
    "the non - equilibrium state was obtained for a system of @xmath101 lj particles in a fcc solid at @xmath93 and density @xmath102 ( density of coexisting solid at @xmath93 @xcite ) by spontaneously expanding the positions to the density @xmath92 by a scaling of all the positions @xmath98 .",
    "a lj systems equilibrium state at the density @xmath92 is a liquid .",
    "the fcc ordered system melted spontaneously , and the conservative systems temperature decreased according to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the change in the temperature at the spontaneous melting is shown with green dashes in figure 2 .",
    "the temperature decreased from @xmath103 within 20 - 40 time steps to @xmath104 .",
    "the differences between @xmath105 and the temperature @xmath106 , obtained for the shadow hamiltonian @xcite are of the order @xmath107 , and they are not visible on the figure .",
    "the decrease in the spontaneous temperature at the melting was balanced by a corresponding increase in the ability ( red line ) , and the energy invariance @xmath3 ( blue small dashes ) was constant in the conservative system .",
    "the two md simulations ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) demonstrate that the traditional and the present ( discrete ) energy concept work equally well .",
    "the discrete va dynamics has the same invariances as newtonian dynamics and it raises the question : which of these formulations that are correct , or alternatively , the most appropriate formulation of classical dynamics ? in this context t. d. lee in 1983 wrote a paper @xcite entitled , `` can time be a discrete dynamical variable ? '' ; which led to a series of publications by lee and collaborators on the formulation of fundamental dynamics in terms of difference equations , but with exact invariance under continuous groups of translational and rotational transformations .",
    "quoting lee @xcite , he `` wish to explore an alternative point of view : that physics should be formulated in terms of difference equations and that these difference equations could exhibit all the desirable symmetry properties and conservation laws '' .",
    "lee s analysis covers not only classical mechanics @xcite , but also non relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory @xcite , and gauge theory and lattice gravity @xcite .",
    "the discrete dynamics is obtained by treating positions and time , @xmath108 , as a discrete dynamical variables , and he obtained a conserved ( mean ) `` energy '' over consecutive time intervals of different lengths . but according to lee @xcite in his formulation of discrete mechanics , `` there is a @xmath109 or time @xmath110 ( in natural units ) .",
    "given any time interval @xmath111 , the total number @xmath5 of discrete points that define the trajectory is given by the integer nearest @xmath112 . ''",
    "the analogy between lee s formulation of discrete dynamics and va dynamics is striking . for the va dynamics",
    "one uses a @xmath113 , and the momenta are not dynamical variables and they have no impact on the discrete dynamics @xcite .",
    "the fundamental length and time in quantum electrodynamics are the planck length @xmath114 m and planck time @xmath115 s @xcite , and they are immensely smaller than the length unit ( given by the floating point precision ) and time increment used in md to generate the classical discrete dynamics .",
    "but the analogy implies that the discrete va dynamics obtained by md is the `` continuation '' of the lee s discrete quantum dynamics for a fundamental length of time @xmath116 , as is the analytic classical dynamics of the traditional quantum mechanics , given by the wigner expansion @xcite .",
    "the discrete non relativistic quantum mechanics is obtained by lee using feynman s path integration formalism , but for discrete positions and a corresponding discrete action , @xmath117\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the end - positions at time @xmath119 and the minimum of @xmath120 determines the classical path .",
    "the action is a sum over products of time increments and `` kinetic energies ''",
    "@xmath99 , and lee has used the symbol @xmath121 , for the average of `` potential energy '' in the time intervals @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "the momenta for all the paths , given by the discrete nodes @xmath123 are obtained from differences , @xmath124 , so the classical va discrete trajectory is the classical limit path for discrete quantum mechanics with @xmath125 , as the classical newtonian trajectory is for the traditional quantum mechanics .",
    "there is , however , one important difference between the analytic and the discrete dynamics .",
    "the momenta @xmath126 in the discrete quantum dynamics are obtained by a difference between discrete sets of positions and they are all @xmath24 with the positions . so the heisenberg uncertainty is a trivial consequence of a discrete quantum electrodynamics with a fundamental length of time @xmath116 .",
    "lee motivates his reformulation of the analytic dynamics in the introduction in @xcite by the difficulties of formulating a general @xmath127 theoretical model for dynamics and with the concluding remarks in @xcite that ( he tries to explore the opposite viewpoint ) : `` difference equations are more fundamental , and differential equations are regarded as approximations '' .",
    "the difference in the energy between the analytic energy and the energy obtained by eq .",
    "( 21 ) for discrete electrodynamics with a unit time increment @xmath128 is of the order @xmath129 , and it is absolute marginal .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty between positions and momenta is of the order @xmath128 and this uncertainty is an inherent quality of discrete dynamics with a fundamental length of time @xmath116 .",
    "the discrete classical va dynamics is fundamentally different from analytic newtonian dynamics , but has the same invariances and the dynamics is obtained equally well by both methods .",
    "but , on the other hand the traditional quantum mechanics is in all manner fully appropriate and justifies no revision of the formulation , and an eventual revision of the dynamics must be justified by other facts than conservation of the energy by classical molecular dynamics simulation with the va algorithm .",
