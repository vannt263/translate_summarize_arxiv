    "we argue that energy released during fallback is _ not _ a promising source of the x - ray flares . the energy liberated during fallback will either lead to a powerful , radiation - driven wind or a more gradually expanding `` breeze '' that could ultimately form a bound cloud around the merged object . in either case , the expanding gas is so opaque that the radiation is trapped in the expanding flow and degraded to low energies before being released in the x - ray band .",

    ", we predict that _ con - x _ could observe @xmath117 while the expected rate for @xmath118 is @xmath119 .      in order to detect the x - ray emission ,",
    "it is necessary to localize the merger . in the following , we discuss two possibilities .",
    "coalescence of compact objects ( especially ns - ns ) are possible candidates as progenitors of sgrbs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "therefore , in principle , a binary coalescence can be localized via a short burst , though there may be limitations .",
    "first , the local observed rate is estimated to be @xmath120 times smaller than the local rate of compact object mergers .",
    "the discrepancy is mostly credited to the geometrical beaming of the burst jet .",
    "moreover , the _ observed _ redshifts range typically between @xmath121 .",
    "however , the distances of these sources could only be measured for a handful of cases in the last few years . despite this",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that short grbs should also explode closer to us , if they are indeed produced by ns - ns mergers , and that some selection effects are preventing us from measuring their redshifts .",
    "when a short grbs with @xmath122 should be localized , the x - ray emission from the wind or the atmosphere could be brighter than the x - ray afterglow around two weeks later .",
    "the gravitational wave signal is a more promising signpost for mergers .",
    "this is because this signal should be associated with any coalescence of compact objects , unlike the beamed @xmath1-ray emission from sgrbs .",
    "an instrument such as _ advanced ligo _ should be able to detect mergers of two neutron stars to a distance of @xmath123 : this implies a detection rate for _ xeus _ and _ con - x _ of @xmath124 . advanced _",
    "ligo _ will be , in fact , more sensitive to ns - bh binaries , which should be visible up to @xmath125 .",
    "since the galactic merger rate for these systems is @xmath126 per galaxy @xcite , _ xeus _ is expected to detect @xmath127 such mergers per year , while _ con - x _ less than @xmath128 per year .",
    "the main limitation seems to be how accurately the merger position could be localized .",
    "current estimates suggest that a network of non - collocated advanced interferometers  such as advanced _ ligo _ , advanced _",
    "virgo _ and _ lcgt _ , @xcite)will be able to detect inspiraling binaries at the redshifts of interest and localize them at a degree level @xcite .",
    "this is enough for an optical but not for an x - ray follow - up .",
    "however , * with a solid angle error * ten times smaller , we can identify a region of the sky with only one local galaxy with redshift @xmath129 ; for a galaxy at @xmath130 , the localization error should be , instead , a few hundreds times smaller .",
    "the source distance maybe be obtained directly from the gravitational signal ( abbot at al .",
    "this would greatly help the search for the x - ray fallback signal .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we investigate the possible fate of fallback matter associated with mergers of compact objects , where a disc is formed by disruption of a ns .",
    "matter flung to highly eccentric orbits will eventually come back to the disc at a super - eddington rate , converting its kinetic energy into heat via shocks , and will be unable to cool by neutrino emission .",
    "contrary to previous claims , we think that this implies that fallback matter _ can not _",
    "accrete all the way to the central object and be responsible for the late energy injections observed in grb afterglows .",
    "rather , the fallback matter is likely to be blown off the disc plane , leading to the formation of a radiation - driven wind or a bound atmosphere . for the wind case",
    ", we have analytically calculated the time evolution of the temperature and luminosity at the trapping radius : while the luminosity decreases ( eq .  [ eq : lxwind ] ) , the wind photosphere becomes hotter ( eq .  [ eq : txwind ] ) . at first",
    ", the emission is in the euv band and absorption will likely prevent us from observing it .",
    "after one or two weeks , the emission finally peaks in the soft x - ray band and the wind activity can be observed .",
    "the bound cloud is radiation pressure - dominated and emits at the eddington limit in soft x - rays , if the atmosphere does not extend much further than @xmath131 cm .",
    "we note that our estimates of luminosities are conservative : factors such as a smaller electron fraction in the ejected plasma and moderate geometrical beaming can substantially increase the expected luminosity .",
    "we also discuss detection prospects for this delayed x - ray activity .",
    "our inspection indicates that only in fortuitous circumstances could the x - ray emission be detected with current instruments , while the planned missions ( such as con - x and xeus ) have a better chance   5.1 .",
    "then , the main limiting factors will not be the x - ray detector capability , but rather the tool for localizing the merger   5.2 .",
    "on the one hand , short @xmath1-ray bursts can be easily detected and localized in the whole volume where instruments like _ con - x _ and _ xeus _ can observe the x - ray emission ; however , they are estimated to occur at a rate that is @xmath120 times smaller than the rate at which compact binaries merge . on the other hand , the planned advanced gravitational wave interferometers should be able to detect a signal from any such a merger but within cosmic distances smaller than the maximum distance that _ con - x _ and _ xeus _ can reach .",
    "moreover , x - ray follow up would require better localization precision than currently estimated .",
    "the net result is that between a few to a few tens of detections per year are expected by _",
    "xeus _ with a follow - up of a short grb . assuming sufficiently good localization , re - pointing",
    "after a gravitational signal detection can result in @xmath132 wind detection per year from ns - ns mergers , for both _ con - x _ and _ xeus_. furthermore for _ xeus _ , there is the exciting possibility to observe x - ray emission from bh - ns mergers : @xmath133 event per year .",
    "the x - ray emission from these sources should also be brighter than from a ns - ns mergers , since the mass of the central bh could be much larger .",
    "the above rates , however , should be taken as indicative of upper limits .",
    "we have not taken into account selection effects such as background / foreground sources and the fact that not all bh - ns and ns - ns mergers seem to lead to an accreting system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , in some cases , the x - ray afterglow from the burst could outshine the wind emission .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility to get information on mergers of compact objects from electromagnetic signals remains , and it could bring important understanding of the physics of these systems .    finally , our findings have implications for interpreting late time activity observed in grb afterglows .",
    "we consider unlikely that fallback matter can be held responsible , since most of the mass is blown away .",
    "even if @xmath134 of this matter can accrete all the way to the hole , it is very unlikely that it could produce the observed flares , which have an energy ( @xmath135 ergs ) comparable to that of the prompt emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this would require that the eccentric tail is far more massive than the main disc ( contrary to what is observed in simulations ) or that the efficiency in converting accreted mass to energy is somehow strongly enhanced in the late fallback accretion .",
    "these arguments also apply to the late accretion from the main disc , which is highly super - eddington @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that , in general , standard late time accretion is unlikely to account for the phenomena , like flares and plateaux , observed in grb afterglows .",
