    "in this note , we are interested in the two following computational problems for classical lie algebras @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 :    * the multiplicity @xmath4 of the weight @xmath5 in the representation @xmath6 of highest weight @xmath7 . * littlewood - richardson coefficients , that is the multiplicity @xmath8 of the representation @xmath9 in the tensor product of representations of highest weights @xmath7 and @xmath5",
    ".    softwares .",
    "( from van leeuwen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and gap  @xcite ) , and maple packages coxeter / weyl ( from stembridge  @xcite ) , use freudenthal s and klimyk s formulae , and work for any semi - simple lie algebra ( not only for classical lie algebras ) .",
    "unfortunately , these formulae are really sensitive to the size of coefficients of weights .",
    "moreover , they do not lead to the computation of associated quasipolynomials @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    here",
    "the approach to these two problems is through _ vector partition function _ , that is the function computing the number of ways one can decompose a vector as a linear combination with nonnegative integral coefficients of a fixed set of vectors . for example the number @xmath12 of ways of counting @xmath13 euros with coins , that is @xmath14    can be seen as the partition of the @xmath15-dimensional vector @xmath16 with respects to the set @xmath17 of 1-dimensional vectors . in the case of the decomposition with respects to the set of positive roots of a simple lie algebra",
    ", we speak of _ kostant partition function_.    recall that any @xmath18-dimensional rational convex polytope can be written as the set @xmath19 of nonnegative solutions @xmath20 of an equation @xmath21 , for a matrix @xmath22 with columns @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it follows that evaluating the vector partition is equivalent to computing the number of integral points in a rational convex polytope .",
    "the vector partition function arises in many areas of mathematics : representation theory , flows in networks , magic squares , statistics , crystal bases of quantum groups .",
    "its complexity is polynomial in the size of input when the dimension of the polytope is fixed , and np - hard if it can vary  @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to the vector partition problem .",
    "for example barvinok s decomposition algorithm  @xcite , recently implemented by the latte team  @xcite , works for general sets of vectors .",
    "beck - pixton  @xcite also created an algorithm dedicated to the vector set arising from the birkhoff polytope , counting the number of semi - magic squares .    in this note",
    ", we use recent results of baldoni - beck - cochet - vergne  @xcite to obtain a fast algorithm for kostant partition function _ via _ inverse laplace formula .",
    "these results involve deconcini - procesi s _ maximal nested sets _",
    "( or in short mnss  @xcite ) and iterated residues of rational functions computed by formal power series development .",
    "we combine resulting procedures with kostant s and steinberg s formulae giving @xmath4 and @xmath8 in terms of vector partition function .",
    "we then obtain a maple program computing for classical lie algebras ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , the multiplicity of a weight in an irreducible finite - dimensional representation , as well as decomposition coefficients of the tensor product of two irreducible finite - dimensional representations .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , they are also the only ones able to compute associated piecewise - defined quasipolynomials @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    these programs ( available at  @xcite ) are specially designed for large parameters of weights . indeed",
    "although only written in maple they can perform examples with weights with 5 digits coordinates , far beyond classical softwares written in c++ .",
    "we also stress that our programs are absolutely clear , easy to use and require no installation of exotic package or program .",
    "retro - compatibility has been checked downto maple vr5 .",
    "they are fully commented , so that a curious user can figure out their internal mechanisms .    however , certain other softwares and packages are not limited by the rank of the algebra like our programs .",
    "for example computation of non - trivial examples in lie algebras of rank @xmath26 is possible with the software . , whereas our programs are efficient up to rank @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "these facts make our programs complementary to traditional softwares .",
    "remark that kostant s and steinberg s formulae have already been implemented once in the case of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this previous program relies on results of baldoni - vergne  @xcite implemented by baldoni - deloera - vergne  @xcite , computing kostant partition function only in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "tools were _ special permutations _ and again iterated residues of rational fraction .",
    "a new technique for littlewood - richardson coefficients has been recently designed by deloera - mcallister  @xcite . for @xmath0",
    ", they wrote an algorithm using hive polytopes  @xcite . for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3",
    ", they implemented berenstein - zelevinsky polytopes  @xcite .",
    "they can also evaluate stretched littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath29 .",
    "these two methods consist in computing a tensor product coefficient as the number of lattice points in just one specific convex rational polytope .",
    "however our programs based on multidimensional residues are faster , and can reach examples not available by their method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sect.repr ] recalls representation theory problems we are interested in and links them with algebraic combinatorics .",
    "section  [ sect.poly ] describes more precisely rational convex polytopes and formulae counting their integral points .",

    "we perform tests of our programs .",
    "let us fix the notations once and for all .",
    "let @xmath30 be a semi - simple lie algebra of rank @xmath31 .",
    "choose a cartan subalgebra @xmath32 of @xmath30 and denote by @xmath33 the weight lattice .",
    "let @xmath34 be a positive roots system .",
    "the root lattice is defined as @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath36 be the cone spanned by linear combinations with nonnegative coefficients of positive roots .",
    "the weyl group of @xmath30 for @xmath32 is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "there exist only four simple lie algebras @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 of rank @xmath31 , called _ classical lie algebras _ of rank @xmath31  @xcite , and determined by their positive roots systems :    @xmath38    the character of a representation @xmath39 of @xmath30 is @xmath40 .",
    "recall that the irreducible finite - dimensional representation of @xmath30 of highest weight @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "hence the weight multiplicity @xmath4 is defined as @xmath41 for any weight @xmath5 such that @xmath42 is in the root lattice .",
    "multiplicities @xmath4 are called _ kostka numbers _ when @xmath43 .    on the other hand , multiplicities of representations @xmath9 in the tensor product @xmath44",
    "are called _ littlewood - richardson coefficients _ ( or _ clebsch - gordan coefficients _ ) . here",
    "@xmath45 is a dominant weight such that @xmath46 is in the root lattice .",
    "evaluating is a difficult task . for @xmath47 ,",
    "computing kostka numbers is immediate and clebsch - gordan s formula gives littlewood - richardson coefficients . for @xmath48 , one can still compute some small examples .",
    "but for general @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) or for weights which components are big ( say , with two digits ) , direct computation is usually intractable .",
    "there exist many formulae from representation theory for @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "the first one , valid in any complex semi - simple lie algebra @xmath30 , is weyl s character formula    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is half the sum of positive roots for @xmath30 .",
    "littlewood - richardson coefficients are obtained from this formula , since the character of @xmath44 is    @xmath53}\\clmn\\ch(v(\\nu)).\\ ] ]    but these two formulae do not lead to efficient computations when the rank of @xmath30 or the size of coefficients of weights grow .",
    "moreover , computing the whole character is untractable : for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the character @xmath56 has 9 monomials but the character @xmath57 has 2903 monomials .",
    "let us describe kostant s and steinberg s formulae in the case of any semi - simple lie algebra @xmath30 . denote by @xmath58 the number of ways one can write a vector @xmath59 as a nonnegative linear combination of positive roots .",
    "remark that @xmath60 unless @xmath59 is in the root lattice @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "this number satisfies the equation    @xmath61 } k_\\g(a)\\ e^{-a}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let @xmath7 and @xmath5 be respectively a dominant weight and a weight such that @xmath62 $ ] . a weyl group element",
    "@xmath63 is _ valid _ for @xmath7 and @xmath5 if the root lattice element @xmath64 is in the cone @xmath36 .",
    "the set of such @xmath65 s is denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "then kostant s formula asserts that the weight multiplicity @xmath4 equals    @xmath67    similarly let @xmath7 , @xmath5 , @xmath45 , be three dominant weights such that @xmath68 $ ] .",

    "remark that kostant s ( resp .",
    "steinberg s ) formula also work when @xmath42 ( resp .",

    "its positive roots system will be denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "multiplicities @xmath4 and @xmath8 behave nicely , in function of the parameters .",
    "more precisely , there exists a decomposition of the space @xmath80 in union of closed cones @xmath77 , such that the restriction of @xmath8 to each cone @xmath77 is given by a quasi - polynomial function .",
    "this follows from theorems of knutson - tao  @xcite ( for @xmath0 ) , berenstein - zelevinsky  @xcite ( for any semi - simple lie algebra ) giving @xmath8 as the number of points in a rational convex polytope . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the fact that @xmath8 is given on each cone @xmath77 by a polynomial function is proven in rassart  @xcite , and the case of @xmath81 is treated as an illustration .",
    "the description of the decomposition of @xmath82 in cones @xmath77 , where the function @xmath4 is polynomial for @xmath0 , was given for low ranks by billey - guillemin - rassart  @xcite .",
    "see also rassart s website  @xcite for wonderful slides .",
    "the common point to kostant s and steinberg s formulae is the function counting the number of decompositions of a root lattice element as a linear combination with nonnegative integral coefficients of positive roots of the lie algebra .",
    "the next section deals with an efficient method to compute it .",

    "indeed any inequality can be replaced by an equality by adding a new variable .",
    "for example polytopes @xmath87 and @xmath88 are isomorphic and have the same number of integral points .",
    "we assume that @xmath59 is in the cone @xmath89 spanned by nonnegative linear combinations of the vectors @xmath90 , so that @xmath86 in non - empty .",
