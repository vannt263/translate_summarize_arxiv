    "extracting the ckm parameter @xmath2 is an important step in testing of the ckm description of cp violation in the @xmath3 meson system . currently , the theoretically cleanest determinations of @xmath2 come from inclusive semileptonic decays which are not sensitive to the details of hadronization ; although recently an approach of extracting @xmath2 , utilizing @xmath4 , has been advanced with a competitive error to inclusive methods .",
    "@xcite    in inclusive extractions of @xmath2 , experimental cuts to exclude the charm background of @xmath5 are imposed .",
    "this restricts the decay products to hadronic final states that have large energy @xmath6 and low invariant mass @xmath7 . with these phase space restrictions the local ope expansion @xcite appropriate for sufficiently inclusive decays used to extract @xmath8 @xcite , typically breaks down .",
    "@xcite    as the local ope , and the clean separation of scales that the local ope represented in the analysis of @xmath5 , is no longer valid ; a more involved theoretical approach is required to separate the scales relevant to these decays .",
    "decay rates are expressed as convolutions of hard ( @xmath9 ) , jet ( @xmath10 ) and soft physics ( @xmath11 ) associated with the scales @xmath12 , in the following way , @xmath13 although this factorization theorem has been proven diagrammatically @xcite at leading order in @xmath14 , it is not known to hold to all orders in the nonperturbative expansion .",
    "it has only recently been extended beyond leading nonperturbative order @xcite .",
    "the systematic treatment of the nonperturbative corrections involve a two step matching procedure .",
    "one matches qcd onto the effective field theory of the intermediate scale , describing quarks and gluons with large energy and small offshellness , known as scet @xcite , and uses the renormalization group evolution to run down to the soft scale .",
    "one then matches scet onto the lightcone wavefunction of the @xmath3 meson , expressed in terms of hqet fields .",
    "one can also match directly from qcd onto hqet , a much simpler procedure at the cost of not summing the logarithms of the ratio of scales @xmath15 via scet . in either case , the soft sector of the theory is expanded in terms of non - local operators . the leading order term in the @xmath16 expansion of the lightcone distribution function of the @xmath3 meson @xcite is know as the shape function .    at subleading order in the nonperturbative expansion , four additional non - local operators have been determined to be present @xcite , the matrix elements of which are referred to as subleading shape functions .",
    "it is of some intrinsic interest to examine the renormalization of these non - local operators , as they are non - local and their renormalizability is not know _ a priori_. it is also important to know if this set of operators is complete in the error assigned to extractions of @xmath2 , and in considering the above factorization theorem beyond leading order .",
    "examining the perturbative behavior of these subleading shape functions is also a necessary step to take to perform one loop matching calculations onto the soft sector . for these reasons",
