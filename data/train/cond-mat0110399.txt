    "at a first - order phase transition several physical quantities , such as the order parameter and the energy density , have a discontinuous behavior in the bulk and the correlation lengths remain generally finite . in spite of the absence of a diverging  true \" length scale in the problem , a successful scaling theory for first - order transitions",
    "has been developed,@xcite with scaling exponents such as @xmath6 which are compatible with discontinuities .",
    "the divergent length scale appearing in the scaling theory is associated with the persistence length of the coexisting phases,@xcite behaving as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for a temperature ( field ) deviation from the transition point , with critical exponents @xmath9 where @xmath2 denotes the dimension of the system . in the renormalization group analysis of specific models ,",
    "first - order transitions have been identified,@xcite which are controlled by a so - called discontinuity fixed point ( dfp ) with thermal and magnetic scaling dimensions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these dimensions are compatible with the value of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ nu_d ] ) whereas other scaling exponents in eq .",
    "( [ d_exp ] ) follow from scaling and hyperscaling relations .    for a system with a free surface at a bulk first - order transition two",
    "diverging lengths can be identified , @xmath14 associated with the correlations in the direction parallel to the surface and @xmath15 in the perpendicular direction .",
    "due to missing bonds , the surface is more weakly coupled than the bulk . as a consequence , the surface order parameter vanishes continuously at the bulk transition point .",
    "this phenomenon , called _ surface - induced disorder_@xcite ( sid ) , is closely related to wetting phenomena.@xcite it has been studied using mean - field theory@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite and has been observed in some experimental systems.@xcite for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) potts model exact results have been obtained in the large-@xmath4 limit and the universality of the critical and tricritical exponents in the bulk first - order transition regime , @xmath16 , has been accurately demonstrated by density matrix renormalization calculations.@xcite    the presence of diverging length scales in the problem suggests a possible scaling behavior for singular quantities , both at the surface and in the bulk of the system . here",
    "we notice two peculiarities concerning the bulk scaling relations .",
    "first , in the geometry with a free surface there is an inherent anisotropy in the problem since the two length scales are related by @xmath17 with an anisotropy exponent @xmath3 which is generally greater than  1 .",
    "consequently , scaling for sid is strongly anisotropic in contrast to the original dfp theory , which was developed for isotropic scaling in the bulk.@xcite our second remark concerns the behavior of the system as the thermodynamic limit is approached . in a system of linear size",
    "@xmath0 , the disordering effect of the surface in the bulk is limited to a temperature range @xmath18 around the critical temperature , where @xmath19 is the perpendicular correlation length exponent [ see below in eq .",
    "( [ xi_perp ] ) ] . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "when @xmath20 , the sid is present in the bulk just at the transition point , when the scaling functions are singular , having either a jump or @xmath21-function - like singularities . in a finite system , however , the scaling functions behave regularly , so that one has a  true \" finite - size scaling behavior , which is measurable , for the specific heat or the susceptibility at the transition point .",
    "another problem of theoretical interest at a first - order transition point accompanied by sid is the influence of different types of perturbations , such as localized or extended defects,@xcite quenched disorder,@xcite etc .",
    ", on the bulk and surface transitions .",
    "here we mainly consider the effect of a quasiperiodic or , more generally , aperiodic modulation of the couplings in the bulk .",
    "the influence of such perturbations on order - disorder phase transitions has been studied in detail for the ising model,@xcite in particular in 2d with a layered structure ( i.e. , when the aperiodic perturbation has a 1d variation ) and in the related quantum ising spin chains . among others , for marginal aperiodic sequences ,",
    "coupling - dependent anisotropic critical behavior has been found.@xcite    at a first - order transition point , such as for the 2d potts model with @xmath16,@xcite the relevance or irrelevance of the effect of aperiodic perturbations is unclear .",
    "one can use an analogy with the rigorous result of aizenman and wehr,@xcite stating that in 2d a first - order transition always softens into a second - order one , due to quenched disorder .",
    "such a softening of the transition was indeed observed in a monte carlo study of the 2d potts model with @xmath16 for some types of layered aperiodic perturbations.@xcite however , due to computational difficulties , quantitative results about the phase transitions , such as critical exponents , could not be obtained .    in the present paper",
    "we use another approach to study the effect of aperiodic perturbations at a first - order transition point and to obtain quantitative results . for this purpose",
    "we consider the 2d potts model@xcite on layered lattices and take the extreme anisotropic limit,@xcite when the logarithm of the transfer matrix of the model corresponds to the hamiltonian of an aperiodic quantum potts chain .",
    "then we consider the large-@xmath4 limit of the model , for which a consistent @xmath22 expansion is defined and the leading term can be treated by analytical or very efficient numerical methods . in analogy with the results on the marginal quantum ising chains ,",
    "one expects that with marginal perturbations the critical exponents , in particular the anisotropy exponent , become coupling dependent . indeed , with a fibonacci - type modulation of the couplings , which is related to the 2d penrose quasilattice",
    ", we have found continuously varying anisotropic scaling . in this way we have obtained a more general testing ground for the scaling relations in the presence of sid .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we present the phenomenological scaling theory for sid both in the bulk and at the surface . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the quantum potts model and its representation in the large-@xmath4 limit . in sec .",
    "iv solutions of the model on the regular lattice and on the fibonacci quasilattice are confronted with predictions of the sid scaling picture .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "we consider a @xmath2-dimensional ( magnetic ) system in the slab geometry with two surfaces at a large finite distance @xmath0 apart , whereas the extent of the system is infinite in the other @xmath23 dimensions , parallel to the surface .",
    "the system displays a bulk first - order transition and has @xmath4 degenerate ordered phases .",
    "the state of the system on the surface at @xmath24 is fixed into one of these phases ( by applying a local magnetic field in the appropriate direction ) whereas the other surface at @xmath25 is free .",
    "the temperature @xmath26 is measured relative to the transition point and a bulk ordering ( magnetic ) field of strength @xmath27 is applied . due to the disordering effect of missing bonds , the order parameter profile @xmath28 is monotonically decreasing towards the free surface .",
    "the surface order parameter @xmath29 may behave in two qualitatively different ways as the temperature is increased to the transition point .",
    "either @xmath29 , like the bulk order parameter @xmath30 , has a finite jump at @xmath31 ( first - order surface transition ) or  and this is the case considered below@xmath29 vanishes continuously as @xmath32 with a surface magnetization exponent @xmath33 ( second - order surface transition ) . in this case",
    "the extent of the surface region @xmath15 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , is diverging at the transition point as @xmath36 as mentioned in the introduction , this phenomenon associated with the long - distance disordering effect of a free surface is called sid .    in the region of sid , correlations between spins in the direction parallel to the free surface decay",
    "exponentionally , which defines a new correlation length @xmath14 , with an asymptotic temperature dependence @xmath37 according to eq .",

    "the study of the associated variation of other scaling exponents provides us with a stronger test of the sid scaling relations .",
    "the marginal nature of the quasiperiodic perturbation of the fibonacci type should be explainable through a relevance - irrelevance criterion , like the harris criterion@xcite for critical systems in the presence of quenched disorder .    for second - order transitions",
    "the relevance or irrelevance of aperiodic perturbations is generally related to the size dependence of the fluctuations of the sequence , which is measured by the wandering exponent @xmath192 . for a 1d variation , as considered in this paper , @xmath192 is defined through the cumulated deviation from the average@xcite @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the average field and @xmath195 is the length of the sequence after @xmath180 substitutions ( i.e. , the fibonacci number @xmath179 ) . as shown in refs .   and  , for a thermal aperiodic perturbation , the crossover exponent at the fixed point of the pure system is @xmath196 , where @xmath19 is the perpendicular correlation length exponent of the pure system .",

    "in order to obtain a relevance - irrelevance criterion adapted to our problem , let us consider the form of the hamiltonian matrix in eq .",
    "( [ htilde ] ) and compare the perturbation associated with a deviation @xmath26 from the transition point , on the one hand , to the perturbation introduced by the aperiodic fluctuations on the other hand .",
    "the temperature perturbation contributes to the diagonal elements by terms of the form @xmath203 according to eq .",
    "( [ dgamma ] ) when @xmath85 is large the last term behaves as @xmath204 and may be neglected since the wandering exponent is always smaller than  1 . taking the average at a length scale @xmath205 of the leading contribution to eq .",
    "( [ dtemp ] ) , one obtains the following estimate for the temperature perturbation : @xmath206 the aperiodic fluctuations contribute mainly to the off - diagonal terms and using eq .",
    "( [ dgamma ] ) , their mean value at the length scale @xmath0 is given by @xmath207 the appropriate length scale is the perpendicular correlation length @xmath208 and the relevance of the aperiodic perturbation depends on the value of the ratio @xmath209 where we used eq .",

    "thus for self - dual aperiodic perturbations the crossover exponent is @xmath210 it follows that with @xmath211 such perturbations are marginal when @xmath201 , in agreement with our results for the fibonacci lattice .    finally , let us briefly mention that we have also studied the effect of an aperiodic perturbation following the period - doubling sequence.@xcite this sequence is generated through the substitutions @xmath212 , and its wandering exponent is @xmath213 .",
