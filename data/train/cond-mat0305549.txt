    "in spite of the different social , technological , and biological interactions , many complex networks in real - worlds have a common structure based on the universal self - organized mechanism : network growth and preferential attachment of connections @xcite@xcite . the structure is called scale - free ( sf ) network , which exhibits a power - law degree distribution @xmath0 , @xmath1 , for the probability of @xmath2 connections .",
    "the topology deviates from the conventional homogeneous regular lattices and random graphs .",
    "many researchers are attracted to a new paradigm of the heterogeneous sf networks in the active and fruitful area .",
    "the structure of sf networks also gives us a strong impact on the dynamics of epidemic models for computer viruses , hiv , and others .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that a susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model on sf networks has no epidemic threshold ; infections can be proliferated , whatever small infection rate they have .",

    "in contrast to the absence of epidemic threshold , an immunization strategy has been theoretically presented in sis models @xcite@xcite .",
    "the targeted immunization applies the extreme disconnections by attacks against hubs with high - degrees on sf networks @xcite to a prevention against the spread of infections .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamic properties for spreading of computer viruses on the sf networks estimated from real data of e - mail communication @xcite . as a new property in both simulation and theoretical analysis ,",

    "the typical phenomenon in observations @xcite@xcite is not explained by the above statistical analysises at steady states or mean - values ( in the fixed size or @xmath3 ) .",
    "we first consider , in simulations , a realistic growing model with the probabilistic execution and detection of viruses on the sf network .",
    "then , for understanding the mechanisms of recoverable prevalence and extinction , we analyze simpler growing models in deterministic equations . by using a mean - field approximation without the connectivity correlations , we derive bifurcation conditions from the extinction to the recoverable prevalence ( or the opposite ) , which is related to the growth , infection , and immune rates . moreover",
    ", we verify the effectiveness of the targeted immunization by anti - viruses for hubs even in the growing system .",
    "we consider a network whose vertices and edges represent computers and the communication via e - mails between users .",
    "the state at each computer @xmath4 is changed from the susceptible , hidden , infectious , and to the recovered by the remove of viruses and installation of anti - viruses .",
    "we make a realistic model in stochastic state transitions with probabilities of the execution and the detection of viruses .",
    "[ fig_shir ] shows the state transitions , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the execution rate from the hidden to the infectious state and the detection rate from the special subjects or doubtful attachment files .",

    "we assume the infected mail is not sent again for the same communication partner ( sent it at only one time ) to be difficult for the detection .",

    "we note the parameters are related to the sharpness of increasing / decreasing infections up / down ( @xmath6 is more sensitive ) .",
    "it is well known , in a closed system of the shir model , the number of infected computers ( the hidden and infectious states ) is initially increased and saturated , finally converged to zero as the extinction . while the pattern may be different in an open system , indeed , oscillations have been described by a deterministic kermack - mckendrik model @xcite . however a constant population ( equal rates of the birth and the death ) or territorial competition has been mainly discussed in the model , the growth of computer network is obviously more rapid , and the communications in mailing are not competitive .",
