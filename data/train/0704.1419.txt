    "the prospect of creating an ordered one dimensional system has lead to the extensive study of chain structures grown on surfaces .",

    "@xcite and therein ) . the honeycomb - chain channel model ( hcc ) is now regarded by many as the most plausible of the candidate structures @xcite . in the hcc model",
    "there are parallel ordered one dimensional lines of metal atoms sited in a silicon free channel .",
    "these are separated by almost flat honeycomb layers of silicon .",
    "the 3@xmath01 system has been studied using leed i - v analysis with ag , li and na as the deposited metal atoms @xcite .",
    "similar i - v curves were obtained in each case and the authors conclude that a common reconstruction of silicon atoms is responsible for the leed i - v curves , which are insensitive to the presence of the metal atom .",
    "however , the authors did not attempt a structural fit .",
    "the leed pattern for the 3@xmath02 surfaces exhibits odd behaviour in that it indicates a 3@xmath01 periodicity .",
    "many workers have suggested that disorder in the position of the metal atom is the cause .",
    "a fourier analysis of a random tesselation of a large sample of registry shifted 3@xmath02 unit cells has been carried out by schfer et al .",
    "they show that this simulation of long range disorder in the position of the metal atom does produce a 3@xmath01 periodicity in reciprocal space .",
    "alternatively , over et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the substrate and silicon adatoms could be acting as the dominant scattering unit with the metal atoms sitting in ` open sites ' .",
    "stm investigations of the 3@xmath02 and 3@xmath01 systems have not provided much evidence of long range disorder in the location of the metal atom apart from registry shifts introduced by a coexisting c(6@xmath02 ) phase .",
    "of particular relevance to this work is the study of the si(111)-3@xmath02-sm system using stm and an _ ab initio _ calculation , carried out by palmino et al .",
    "they have used the bias voltage dependence of the stm images of the surface to isolate the features associated with the honeycomb chain and the samarium atom and separate comparison of these with simulated stm images obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculation show that the hcc structure is in good lateral qualitative agreement with experiment .    in this study",
    "we have used leed i - v analysis and several _ ab initio _ calculations to quantitatively investigate the 3@xmath02 reconstruction of the si(111)-3@xmath02-sm surface .",
    "we show that the hcc structure gives good agreement with experiment .",
    "we consider two hcc unit cells in which the samarium atom is located in the t4 site or the h3 site .",
    "palmino et al .",
    "@xcite have found the energy difference of these two configurations to be 0.07 ev / sm . we have calculated the atomic positions and the energies of these two reconstructions and obtained leed i - v curves for this system and we show that a linear combination of the two hcc structures is the optimum match to experiment with a ratio that slightly favours the structure with the lower energy of the two .",
    "we have also used leed i - v analysis to investigate the missing half order spots for the 3@xmath02 unit cell .",
    "we show using calculated i - v curves that for an individual unit cell the intensity of the half order spots is significantly lower than that of the spots that are visible in the experiments .",
    "we also show that the calculated i - v curves do not differ significantly if the samarium atom is not present .",
    "we offer this as evidence that disorder over multiple unit cells is not needed to explain the stm / leed discrepancy for the 3@xmath02 systems and we suggest that the order in the one dimensional chain may persist over large length scales .",
    "a dedicated leed chamber of in - house design @xcite operating at a typical uhv base pressure of @xmath1 mbar was used to carry out our experiments .",
    "the silicon substrate was cleaned by flashing to @xmath2c using an electron beam heater and then the sample was slowly cooled through the @xmath3c region over a period of 15 minutes .",
    "a sharp 7@xmath07 leed pattern resulted , confirming that a clean si(111)-7@xmath07 surface had been made .",

    "the sample was prepared by depositing 1 ml of sm from a quartz crystal calibrated evaporation source onto the clean si(111)-7@xmath07 surface which was not at elevated temperature .",
    "this was followed by a hot anneal at @xmath5c for 15 minutes .",
    "a sharp 3@xmath01 leed pattern was observed and images of this are shown in figure [ fig : fig01 ] .",
    "other workers have observed some streaking in the 3@xmath01 leed pattern that is indicative of one dimensional disorder .",
    "we have not observed such streaking in our diffraction patterns and we attribute this to our preparation procedure .",
    "there is some variability in the annealing temperature that can be used and temperatures in the range @xmath6c all gave a sharp diffraction pattern .",

    "the variation in its intensity with primary electron energy was recorded which resulted in a set of 42 i - v curves .",

    "_ ab initio _ calculations were performed using the ` castep ` code @xcite .",
    "the code was run on 30 processors in a parallel computing environment at the hpcx high performance computing facility located at the cclrc daresbury laboratory in the uk .",
    "we have geometry optimised two different unit cells for the hcc structure ( see figure [ fig : fig05 ] for details of these ) . in the first unit cell the samarium atom is located in the t4 site with respect to the first bulk - like silicon layer and in the other unit cell the samarium atom is situated in a h3 site .",
    "we will refer to the two structures as ` t4 ' and ` h3 ' .",
    "the initial atomic positions were those that were obtained in the _ ab initio _",
    "study by palmino et al .",
    "@xcite and these were very kindly provided by f. palmino .    before proceeding the input parameters in the calculation",
    "were carefully checked ( see @xcite for a discussion of the importance of this ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig03 ] shows how the calculated energy varies with the number of plane waves included in the calculation as the cutoff energy is raised for three increasingly dense monkhorst - pack @xcite reciprocal space sampling grids .",
    "+    a cutoff energy of 380 ev yields a total energy that is unambiguously in the variational minimum and will allow accurate calculation of the energy and the forces within the system .",
    "we have used the sampling grid with 3 k - points in reciprocal space since an increase to 6 k - points does not significantly change the energy .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite generalised gradient approximation was used to represent exchange and correlation effects .",
    "the vacuum gap that was used to prevent interaction between the top surface in one supercell and the bottom surface in the supercell above was 9 thick and this has been optimised during the course of other _ ab initio _ studies of re silicides that we have done .",
    "we have included two bulk - like silicon layers below the top layer that contains the samarium atom and the honeycomb chain structure . to prevent interactions through the supercell between uncompensated charge in the the top and bottom layers and to fully replicate the transition to the bulk silicon crystal we have hydrogen passivated",
    "the deepest bulk - like silicon layer and fixed the coordinates of these atoms so that they are not free to move from their bulk positions .",
    "we have repeated the geometry optimisation of the unit cells without passivation and positional constraints and the final positions of the silicon atoms in this bottom layer are not drastically altered and the total energy does not significantly change as a result which suggests that using so few bulk - like layers is reasonable .",
    "we nevertheless kept the hydrogen passivation in place since it reduces the computational cost of the electronic structure calculation by the quenching of dangling bonds on the underside of the supercell .",
    "the structures were allowed to relax until the forces were below the predefined tolerance of @xmath8 ev /  .",
    "figure [ fig : fig04 ] shows the convergence of the total energy and the maximum force on any atom as the geometry optimisation proceeds for the two structures .",
    "the t4 structure is 0.7 ev ( 0.01% ) lower in energy than the h3 structure and the maximum force in the system is slightly lower .",
    "this energy difference can not be quantitatively compared with the value of 0.07 ev / sm that was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite since this is an atomically resolved energy difference whereas the value presented here compares the total energies of the two supercells with contributions from all of the atoms within .",
    "also , one can not compare the basis set parameters used in this work with those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite since the two calculations used different types of pseudopotentials and a different _ ab initio _ code .",
    "the final optimised structures are shown in figure [ fig : fig05 ] .",
    "the interlayer spacings ( ignoring the samarium atom for now ) in both structures here are almost identical .",
    "the major difference between this calculated structure and that in ref .",
    "@xcite is in the interlayer spacings . in this",
    "study the spacing between the top layer and the first bulk - like layer ( l1 in figure [ fig : fig05 ] ) is approximately 8% greater than that in ref . @xcite and",
    "the spacing between the first bulk - like layer the the second bulk - like layer ( l2 in figure [ fig : fig05 ] ) is about 4% greater .",
    "there are also some minor differences in the position of the silicon atoms in the honeycomb chain .",
    "figure [ fig : fig06 ] shows i - v curves calculated using the ` cavleed ` code @xcite for the three candidate _",
    "ab initio _ structures .",
    "the curves shown are only the integer spots in the leed pattern and they were calculated using the bulk debye temperatures ( that is 645 k for silicon and 169 k for samarium ) to represent the lattice vibrations of each layer .",
    "the structures obtained from the two _ ab initio _ calculations in this study are a consistently better match to experiment than that in ref .",
    "this suggests that the interlayer spacings obtained in this study , to which leed is very sensitive , are closer to those present in the real surface . also , note that the i - v curves of the t4 and h3 structures from this study are very similar and we can not discard either structure .",
    "+    we can divide the spots in the leed pattern into two groups .",
    "the integer spots ( ( 1,0 ) , ( 2,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) etc ) contain a large contribution from the bulk and are sensitive to the top few layers .",
    "the fractional spots ( ( 2/3,0 ) , ( 1/3,1 ) etc ) are extremely sensitive to the top layer reconstruction and only mildy sensitive to deeper layers through multiple scattering .    the poor pendry r - factors ( that is @xmath90.7 in this context where enhanced vibrations have not been applied ) for some of the integer spots in figure [ fig : fig06 ] indicate that further structural optimisation is needed .",
    "it is apparent that for some curves the right peaks are present but that their energy is slightly wrong ( see the ( 0,2 ) and ( 2,0 ) spots in figure [ fig : fig06 ] for example ) .",
    "the fractional spots have much better r - factors ( see figure  [ fig : fig07 ] ) which indicates that the structure of the top layer is in good agreement with experiment . the natural way to proceed",
    "is to vary the interlayer spacings to attempt an improvement in the match with experiment , particularly for the integer spots . in the next section",
    "this is attempted .",
    "the calculation of the i - v curves was repeated using various values for the interlayer spacings and the r - factors were determined .",
    "an initial coarse search was carried out over a wide range of values for the spacings and with a large step size .",
    "figure [ fig : fig07 ] shows the r - factor landscape obtained in this manner for the fractional spots .",
    "there is a clear minimum in both cases .",
    "the samarium atom has been considered in determining the midpoint of the top layer which is why the minima do not coincide ; the samarium atom sits proud of the honeycomb layer in the h3 structure and it is much lower in the t4 structure . in the _",
    "ab initio _ calculations in this study the interlayer spacings were approximately 3.06 , 3.10for the h3 structure and 2.65 , 3.14  for the t4 structure which places the _ ab initio _ energy minimum ( indicated by a cross in figure [ fig : fig07 ] ) very close to that of the ` cavleed ` i - v r - factor minimum .",
    "two independent techniques are thus suggesting very similar best fit structures .",
    "i - v curves were then obtained using a narrower range of interlayer spacings focussed on the minima obtained in the coarse search .",
    "this fine search , using a step size of 0.01  , improved the r - factors by only around 0.01 in both cases and even finer searches were not carried out .",
    "[ fig : fig08:b ]     there is another interlayer spacing deeper into the bulk that we might try to vary .",
    "computational resources do not permit us to independently vary this spacing along with those between the top three layers .",
    "figure [ fig : fig08 ] shows the variation of the pendry r - factor as the spacing between layers three and four is changed with the first and second interlayer spacings fixed at their optimum value .",
    "we can see that there is a small improvement in the r - factor for the fractional spots at the expense of a large worsening of the r - factor for the integer spots , which are more sensitive to structure in the near bulk .",
    "we therefore reject any variation of this interlayer spacing and retain the bulk value . that there is no significant reconstruction deeper into the surface justifies the use of three layers in our _ ab initio _ calculation and means that in both the _ ab initio _ calculation and the pendry r - factor structure fit to the experimental data we have considered two interlayer spacings .",
    "the effect of thermal vibrations within the system has also been investigated .",
    "the debye temperature @xmath10 of the samarium atom , the silicon atoms in the honeycomb layer and the silicon atoms in the first bulk - like layer have each been independently reduced by a factor of @xmath11 and @xmath12 from their bulk values .",
    "the effects of these enhanced vibrations for the two most effective combinations are shown in table [ tab : table1 ] alongside the r - factors obtained with no enhanced vibrations .",
    ".[tab : table1]variation of the debye temperature for the samarium atom , silicon honeycomb layer and first bulk like layer and the effect upon the pendry r - factors for the h3 structure .",
    "the naming scheme here is sm = samarium atom , si1=silicon honeycomb atoms , si2=first silicon bulk - like layer .",
    "a debye temperature of @xmath13 indicates the bulk unoptimised value for that atomic species .",
    "similar data are available for the t4 structure",
    ". further enhancement of the vibrations of the samarium atom worsens the r - factors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +     +",
    "the silicon honeycomb layer is almost mirror symmetric about a plane perpendicular to the @xmath02 direction .",
    "it is the location of the samarium atom that breaks this mirror symmetry and renders a quasi 3@xmath01 unit cell into a 3@xmath02 unit cell .",
    "figure [ fig : fig12 ] shows calculated i - v curves for the h3 structure for the fractional and integer spots compared with those for the same structure with the samarium atom removed .",
    "the bulk debye temperatures were used throughout to minimise the influence of vibrations .",
    "it is readily apparent that the i - v curves are insensitive to the presence of the samarium atom .",
    "this is not to say that the samarium atom is not a strong scatterer .",
    "it would appear that the silicon honeycomb layer as a scattering unit of 8 atoms contributes much more to the i - v curves than the single samarium atom .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the leed i - v structural analysis of ag- and li - induced si(111)-(@xmath14 by over et al .",
    "@xcite and was suggested as a cause for the 3@xmath01/3@xmath02 discrepancy in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if this is the case then the half order spots that are apparently missing when the experimental 3@xmath01 leed pattern is inspected visually should produce calculated i - v curves whose intensity is very much less than that of the spots that are visible during experiment .",
    "the silicon honeycomb layer is not perfectly symmetrical about the mirror plane perpendicular to the @xmath02 direction and this should contribute to the half order spot intensities .",
    "figure [ fig : fig13 ] shows the i - v curves of some of the calculated half order spots compared to that of the ( 1,0 ) spot .",
    "+    it would appear that the 3@xmath02 unit cell produces a 3@xmath02 leed pattern with half order spots that are so weak in intensity that they fall below the background intensity leaving only a 3@xmath01 leed pattern visible .",
    "the pendry r - factors obtained upon comparison of the _ ab initio _ calculations with experiment are not as low as we would expect .",
    "we can see that for some spots the i - v curves are visually very similar to those obtained experimentally ( see the i - v curves for the ( 1,1/3 ) and ( 2,0 ) spots for example ) but they have a poor r - factor .",
    "this suggests that the structure is very nearly right and the minor discrepancy could be a result of our not including enough bulk like silicon layers in the bottom of the supercell with consequent effects upon the reconstruction within the top honeycomb layer .",
    "we have attempted some simple variation in the top layer structure , for example flattening the layer , but this drastically worsens the r - factor .",
    "computational resources prohibit us from calculating the structure with more silicon layers and from investigating the honeycomb layer structure further using leed i - v and perhaps further study with a leed i - v genetic algorithmn search might optimise this structure further .",
    "the moderate r - factors are offset by the fact that two independent techniques both show optimum structural fits for almost identical interlayer spacings .",
    "the lateral atomic structure was freely varied in the _ ab initio _ calculations in this work and the lateral atomic positions agree well with those found by palmino at al .",
    "@xcite which they have shown to be in good qualitative agreement with experimental stm images . in this work",
    "we have concentrated upon the optimisation of the vertical spacings , to which leed is particularly sensitive .",
    "the r - factors for the integer spots are consistently worse than those for the fractional spots .",
    "there is the possibility that there are some regions in which there is a disordered overlayer of samarium atop a bulk terminated si(111)-1@xmath01 surface .",
    "such a phase has been reported by wigren et al . @xcite .",
    "the integer spots from such regions might contribute to the overall integer spots for the surface and reduce the level of agreement with the calculated i - v curves for the pure 3@xmath02 surface .",
    "we have not been able to determine the long range order in the system .",
    "we might expect that simple electrostatic repulsion along the 1d chain would space out the metal atoms and provide large separate domains of the h3 and the t4 structures .",
    "however , the two sites are almost degenerate and there would be an entropic gain from disorder . in the literature one can find evidence for both order and disorder in the long range positions of the metal atoms . in this study the improvement in the pendry r - factor when the t4 and h3 structures are considered together on the surface suggests that both sites are occupied within the surface .",
    "we have also shown that we do not require more than one unit cell to explain the missing half order spots in the leed pattern and our experimentally observed leed patterns show a low background due to good order on the surface .",
    "it could be that there is long range disorder on the surface and that the coupling between many adjacent h3 and t4 unit cells and matching of the interlayer spacings introduces a slight strain that changes the structure in the honeycomb layer and the first bulk - like layer enough to account for our pendry r - factors .",
    "if this is the case then it would be impossible to obtain the structure of the honeycomb layer to a high degree of accuracy without an _ ab initio _ calculation using a supercell that comprises several thousand unit cells of the h3 and t4 structures randomly tesselated in both directions .",
    "we have provided a quantitative validation of the honeycomb - chain channel model common to the 3@xmath01 and 3@xmath02 structures formed by alkali , alkali - earth and rare - earth metals on si(111 ) .",
    "several i - v datasets were obtained from leed experiments and used to fingerprint the surface .",
    "the atomic structure suggested by our two _ ab initio _ calculations is in reasonable agreement with this experimental data .",
    "further structural optimisation and mapping of the r - factor landscape have shown that a slight outward expansion of the top layer improves the fit somewhat but increasing the vibrations in the top two layers gives a significant improvement .",
    "a linear combination of the two hcc structures has been shown to improve the fit still further with the ratio being slightly in favour of the structure with the lower energy of the two .",
    "finally , we have calculated the intensities of the half order spots and shown that they are sufficiently dim to fall below the background intensity in a leed experiment .",
    "little change in the calculated i - v curves results from removing the samarium atom which supports the idea that as a scattering unit the silicon honeycomb layer dominates the unit cell and makes leed insensitive to the metal atom in these 3@xmath0 systems .",
