    "the moduli stack of maps from a curve to the stack quotient of a smooth projective variety by the action of a complex reductive group has a natural stability condition introduced by mundet in @xcite and investigated further in schmitt @xcite ; the condition generalizes stability for bundles over a curve introduced by mumford , narasimhan - seshadri and ramanathan @xcite .",

    "we denote by @xmath7 the projection to the classifying space . in case @xmath0",
    "is a point , a stability condition for @xmath8 , bundles on @xmath3 , was introduced by ramanathan @xcite . in the case that @xmath0 is not a point , a stability condition that combines bundle and target stability was introduced by mundet @xcite and it depends on the choice of a @xmath1-linearization @xmath9 .",
    "there is a compactified moduli stack @xmath10 whose open locus consists of mundet semistable maps from a curve @xmath11 to @xmath2 of class @xmath12 with markings @xmath13 the compactification uses the notion of kontsevich stability for maps @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the stack admits evaluation maps to the quotient stack @xmath14 in addition , assuming stable = semistable there is a virtual fundamental class constructed via the machinery of behrend - fantechi @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the formal completion of @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and let @xmath18 be the equivariant novikov ring of formal linear combinations of symbols @xmath19 .",
    "the _ gauged gromov - witten trace _ is the map @xmath20 the derivatives of the potential will be called gauged gromov - witten invariants . for toric varieties , the potential @xmath21 already appears in givental @xcite and lian - liu - yau @xcite under the name of _ quasimap potential_. in those papers ( following earlier work of morrison - plesser @xcite ) the gauged potential is explicitly computed in the toric case , and questions about gromov - witten invariants of toric varieties or complete intersections are reduced to a computation of quasimap invariants .",
    "so what we are concerned with here is the generalization of that story to arbitrary git quotients , especially the non - abelian and non - fano cases to cover situations such as arbitrary toric stacks and quiver moduli . especially , we are interested in re - proving and extending the results of those papers in a uniform and geometric way that extends to quantum k - theory and non - abelian quotients and does not use any assumption such as the existence of a torus action with isolated fixed points .",
    "the splitting axiom for the gauged invariants is somewhat different than the usual splitting axiom in gromov - witten theory : the potential @xmath21 is a non - commutative version of a _ trace _ on the frobenius manifold @xmath16 .",
    "note that there are several other notions of gauged gromov - witten invariants , for example , ciocan - fontanine - kim - maulik @xcite , frenkel - teleman - tolland @xcite , as well as a growing body of work on gauged gromov - witten theory with potential @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the goal of this paper is describe , from the point of view of algebraic geometry , a cobordism between the moduli stack of mundet semistable maps and the moduli stack of stable maps to the git quotient with corrections coming from `` affine gauged maps '' .",
    "affine gauged maps over a point are data @xmath31 where @xmath32 \\in { \\mathbb{p}}^1 $ ] is the point `` at infinity '' , modulo _ affine _ automorphisms , that is , automorphisms of @xmath33 which preserve the standard affine structure on @xmath34 .",

    "the _ quantum kirwan map _ is the map @xmath41 defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath42 be evaluation at infinity restricted to affine gauged maps , and @xmath43 push - forward using the virtual fundamental class .",
    "the quantum kirwan map is @xmath44 as a formal map each term in the taylor series of @xmath45 is well - defined on @xmath16 , but in general the sum of terms may have convergence issues .",
    "the @xmath46 specialization of @xmath45 is the kirwan map to the cohomology of a git quotient studied in @xcite .",
    "the cobordism relating stable maps to the quotient with mundet semistable maps is itself a moduli stack of gauged maps with scaling defined by allowing the linearization to tend towards infinity , that is considering the mundet semistability with respect to @xmath47 as @xmath48 goes to infinity . in order to determine which stability condition to use ,",
    "the source curves must be equipped with additional data of a _ scaling _ : a section @xmath49 of the projectivized relative dualizing sheaf .",
    "if the section is finite , one uses the mundet semistability condition , while if infinite one uses the stability condition on the target .",
    "the possibility of constructing a cobordism in this way was suggested by a symplectic argument of gaio - salamon @xcite .",
    "a _ scaled gauged map _ is a map to the quotient stack whose domain is a curve equipped with a section of the projectivized dualizing sheaf and a collection of distinct markings : a datum @xmath50 where    * @xmath51 is a nodal curve of genus @xmath52 , * @xmath53 is a morphism to the quotient stack @xmath2 that consists of a principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath54 and a map @xmath55 of whose class projects to @xmath56 \\in    h_2(c)$ ] , and * @xmath57 is a section of the projectivization of the relative dualizing sheaf @xmath58 satisfying certain properties .    in the case that @xmath26 is an orbifold , the domain @xmath59 is allowed to have orbifold singularities at the nodes and markings and the morphism is required to be representable .",

    "the properness of these moduli stacks was argued via symplectic geometry in @xcite .",
    "we give an algebraic proof in @xcite .",
    "the cobordism of the previous paragraph gives rise to a relationship between the gauged invariants and the invariants of the quotient that we call the quantum witten formula .",
    "the formula expresses the failure of a diagram @xmath72    \\widehat{qh}_g(x ) \\arrow{dr}[swap]{\\tau_x^g }    \\arrow{rr}{{\\kappa}_x^g } & & \\widehat{qh } ( x { /\\kern-.7ex/}g )    \\arrow{dl}{\\tau_{x { /\\kern-.7ex/}g } } \\\\     & \\lambda_x^g &     \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] to commute as an explicit sum of contributions from wall - crossing terms . here",
    "@xmath73 denote formal completions of the quantum cohomologies , @xmath18 is the equivariant novikov ring and the diagonal arrows are the potentials that arise from virtual integration over the certain moduli stacks of gauged maps .",
    "the wall - crossing terms vanish in the limit of large linearization and are not discussed in this paper , and the formula becomes @xmath74 before explaining how the formula follows from the cobordism , perhaps we should begin by explaining what applications we have in mind for gauged gromov - witten invariants of this type and the adiabatic limit theorem in particular .",
    "many interesting varieties in algebraic geometry have presentations as git quotients .",
    "the grassmannian and projective toric varieties are obvious examples ; well - studied also are quiver varieties such as the moduli of framed sheaves on the projective plane via the atiyah - drinfeld - hitchin - manin construction . in each of these cases ,",
    "the moduli stacks of gauged maps are substantially simpler than the moduli stacks of maps to the git quotients .",
    "this is because the `` upstairs spaces '' are affine , and so the objects in the moduli stacks ( at least in the case without markings ) are vector bundles with sections . in many cases",
    "this means that the gauged gromov - witten invariants can be explicitly computed , even though the gromov - witten invariants of the git quotient can not .",
    "sample applications of the quantum kirwan map and the adiabatic limit theorem include presentations of the quantum cohomology rings of toric varieties ( more generally toric stacks with projective coarse moduli spaces ) @xcite and formulas for quantum differential equations on , for example , the moduli space of framed sheaves on the projective plane @xcite . more broadly , the gauged gromov - witten invariants often have better conceptual properties than the gromov - witten invariants of the git quotients .",
    "so for example , one obtains from the adiabatic limit theorem a wall - crossing formula for gromov - witten invariants under variation of git , which in particular shows invariance of the graph potentials in the case of a crepant wall - crossing @xcite .",
    "we now sketch the proof of the quantum witten formula .",
    "consider the degree @xmath75 contributions from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the latter contribution is the integral of @xmath79 over @xmath10 . by",
    ", this integral is equal to the integral of @xmath79 over @xmath80 with @xmath81 the integral of @xmath79 can be written as the push - forward of @xmath82 under the product of evaluation maps @xmath83 followed by integration over @xmath84 .",
    "taking into account the number @xmath85 of unordered partitions @xmath86 of the given sizes @xmath87 , this composition is equal to the degree @xmath75 contribution from @xmath76 to @xmath88 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "scaled curves are curves with a section of the projectivized dualizing sheaf incorporated , intended to give complex analogs of spaces introduced by stasheff @xcite such as the multiplihedron , cyclohedron etc",
    ". the commutativity of diagrams such as will follow from divisor class relations in the moduli space of scaled curves , in a way similar to the proof of associativity of the quantum product via the divisor class relation in the moduli space of stable , @xmath89-marked genus curves .",
    "recall from deligne - mumford @xcite and behrend - manin ( * ? ? ? * definition 2.1 ) the definition of stable and prestable curves .",
