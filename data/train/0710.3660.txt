    "the frequency of any periodic event like the mechanical oscillation of pendulum or stable atomic frequencies can be used to define the unit of time .",
    "the frequencies derived from selected atomic resonant transitions are particularly preferred due to various advantages they offer compared to mechanical oscillations .",
    "they are extremely stable , accurately measurable and reproducible . though the cesium atomic clock frequency @xcite is accurate to 4 parts in @xmath9 , a variety of atoms and ions",
    "have been proposed as candidates for the next generation of frequency standards @xcite . of these candidates ,",
    "certain ions with forbidden transitions in the optical regime are of special importance . trapped and laser cooled single ions and neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices are currently the leading candidates for atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "frequency standard experiments with trapped ions require considerable skill and ingenuity .",
    "it is a indeed very challenging to measure the clock frequencies to a high degree of precision .",
    "effects like the second - order zeeman , the electric quadrupole shift , etc .",
    "arise from the interaction of the ion with stray fields .",
    "it was shown recently that the systematic effects caused by these shifts will not limit the accuracy of the optical clock @xcite .",
    "it was shown earlier that yb@xmath10 is one of the suitable candidates for defining a frequency standard @xcite .",
    "other candidates like sr@xmath10 @xcite , ca@xmath10 @xcite , ba@xmath10 @xcite , hg@xmath10 @xcite etc have also been considered for setting up the frequency standard . in particular",
    ", yb@xmath10 is a very versatile candidate , having the clock transitions in the visible , ir and microwave regions .",
    "the transition which is being considered for the frequency standard experiment is the forbidden electric quadrupole ( @xmath11 ) transition between the ground state ( @xmath12 ) and the metastable excited state ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "precise measurements of the electric quadrupole moments of these ions have been performed @xcite .",
    "comparison of the experimental values of electric quadrupole moments with those calculated theoretically , would serve as excellent tests of relativistic atomic theories .",
    "an earlier calculation of this quantity for @xmath14 , using relativistic coupled - cluster theory yielded a value @xmath15 @xcite for the 4d @xmath2 state , which was in very good agreement with it s measured value @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the electronic charge and @xmath6 is the bohr radius .",
    "this was the most accurate calculation of the quantity for the 4d @xmath2 state of @xmath14 to date and the excellent agreement of the measured and the calculated values indicates the potential of the method used . in this paper , the electric quadrupole moment of @xmath17 in the state",
    "@xmath0 has been calculated using relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) theory .",
    "indeed a comparison of this property of a heavy ion like @xmath17 with accurate experimental data is a far more stringent test of rcc than the corresponding comparison for sr@xmath10 .",
    "the calculation of eqm for @xmath17 is computationally more demanding due to the presence of a large number of occupied orbitals . in our calculation , the entire core has been excited .",
    "this leads to a rapid proliferation in the number of cluster amplitude equations with the size of the virtual space considered , and therefore a very large increase in the number of computations necessary to determine these amplitudes .",
    "obtaining convergence for the large number of cluster amplitude equations with an appropriate iterative method is a daunting task for heavy atomic systems like @xmath17 .",
    "the calculations on such systems hence involve the combination of the power of the relativistic many - body theories with the state - of - the - art high performance computational techniques .",
    "an outline of the application of the rcc method to calculate atomic electric quadrupole moments has already been presented in @xcite .",
    "the details of this theory have been discussed in several papers @xcite . here",
    "we shall give the salient features of the method for completeness .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ theory ] and section [ compute ] deal with the theoretical methods we have employed and the details of our calculation respectively . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results and compare with the available data .",
    "we have also discussed the effects of different many - body contributions .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ concl ] and highlight the important findings of our work .",
    "we start with the @xmath18-electron closed - shell dirac - fock ( df ) reference state @xmath19 , which is the fermi vaccuum for the present formulation . in coupled - cluster ( cc )",
    "theory the exact wavefunction for the core sector in terms of this reference state is given by , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cluster operator which takes into account the excitations from the closed - shell core to the virtual orbitals . in singles and doubles",
    "( sd ) approximation , the cluster amplitude @xmath21 is written as @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the cluster amplitudes for single and double excitations respectively and the curly brackets denote the _ _ n__ormal ordering with respect to the fermi vaccuum .",
    "this is known as coupled - cluster with singles and doubles , namely ccsd .",
    "here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the corresponding single particle amplitudes and @xmath27 stand for occupied ( virtual ) orbitals and @xmath28 denotes normal ordering with respect to the common reference state ( vacuum ) @xmath19 . for a one - valence one - dimensional model space",
    "the label ` v ' is used to represent a valence orbital . in our approach",
    "we deal with the normal ordered hamiltonian which is defined as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the dirac - fock energy .      to determine the wavefunctions for the open shell orbitals we employ open - shell coupled - cluster method for electron attachment ( oscc - ea ) for the valence particle ( @xmath31 ) sector . using the scheme of electron attachment ( ea )",
    "we obtain the @xmath32-electron open shell system as    @xmath33    for a single valence system , we start with the reference state @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the valence orbital as mentioned in the previous section and the operator @xmath36 represents creation of a particle in the valence space .",
    "the many - body exact open - shell wavefunction for the @xmath32-electron open shell system now becomes ,    @xmath37    where the curly brackets denote the _",
    "_ n__ormal ordering with respect to @xmath38 . for a single valence system ,",
    "the operator @xmath39 turns out to be @xmath40    @xmath41    with @xmath42 here @xmath43 corresponds to the excitation operator in the valence ( @xmath35 ) sector and and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the singles and doubles amplitudes respectively .",
    "the evaluation of the cluster amplitudes are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "apart from singles and doubles , only approximate triple excitations ( ccsd(t ) ) have been included . in this calculation , we have used oscc - ea to obtain the @xmath46 state of @xmath8which is followed by property calculations as given in sub - section [ prop - calc ] .",
    "the expectation value of any operator @xmath47 with respect to the exact state is given by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the dressed operator .",
    "the first few terms of the operators in the above expression ( eq .",
    "( [ prop - eqn ] ) ) can be identified as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 etc .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements are referred to as dressed dirac - fock ( ddf ) , dressed pair correlation ( dpc ) and dressed core polarization ( dcp ) respectively .",
    "we use the term ` dressed ' because the operator @xmath50 includes the effects of certain core excitations , i.e. , core - correlation effects .",
    "in addition to the above , we can identify a few other terms which play a non - negligible role in determining the correlation effects .",
    "one of those terms is @xmath54 which we call the dressed higher order pair correlation ( dhopc ) since it directly involves the correlation between a pair of electrons .",
    "diagrams representing these terms have already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite but we have nevertheless given them here for clarity .",
    "the diagrams ( a ) and ( c ) are subsets of dressed pair correlation ( dpc ) diagrams .",
    "diagram ( b ) is one of the direct dressed core - polarization ( dcp ) diagram . ]",
    "the interaction of the atomic quadrupole moment with the external electric - field gradient is analogous to the interaction of a nuclear quadrupole moment with the electric fields generated by the atomic electrons at the nucleus . in the presence of the electric field , this gives rise to an energy shift by coupling with the gradient of the electric field .",
    "thus the treatment of atomic electric quadrupole moment is analogous to its nuclear counterpart .",
    "the quadrupole moment @xmath55 of an atomic state @xmath56 is defined as the diagonal matrix element of the quadrupole operator with the maximum value @xmath57 and is expressed as    @xmath58    here @xmath59 specifies the electronic configuration of the atoms which distinguishes the initial and final states ; @xmath60 is the total angular momentum of the atom and @xmath61 is the summation of nuclear and atomic angular momentum with @xmath62 its projection .",
    "the electric quadrupole operator in terms of the electronic coordinates is given by , @xmath63 where the sum is over all the electrons and @xmath64 is the coordinate of the @xmath65th electron . to calculate the quantity we express the quadrupole operator in its single particle form as @xmath66 and the single particle reduced matrix element",
    "is expressed as @xcite    @xmath67    in eq.(@xmath68 ) , the subscripts @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to the final and initial states respectively ; @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the radial part of the large and small components of the single particle dirac - fock wavefunctions respectively and @xmath73 is the total angular momentum for the @xmath70th electron .",
    "the angular factor is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 being the orbital angular momentum and the rank respectively .    finally using the wigner eckart theorem we define the electric quadrupole moment in terms of the reduced matrix elements as @xmath78",
    "this calculation is performed in the following steps : the first step being the generation of single particle basis for @xmath79 using the gaussian basis set expansion .",
    "this is followed by the generation of the coupled cluster amplitudes ( @xmath21 ) for the closed - shell @xmath79 system . in the next step ,",
    "the virtual orbitals @xmath80 and @xmath81 are generated using the open - shell coupled cluster method for electron attachment ( oscc - ea ) .",

    "the orbitals used in the present work are generated by kinetically balanced finite basis set expansion ( fsbe ) of gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) @xcite @xmath82 with @xmath83 for @xmath84 type functions , respectively .",
    "the exponents are determined by the even tempering condition @xcite @xmath85 the starting point of the computation is the generation of the dirac - fock ( df ) orbitals @xcite which are defined on a radial grid of the form @xmath86\\label{comp-3}\\ ] ] with the freedom of choosing the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "all df orbitals are generated using a two parameter fermi nuclear distribution @xmath89 where the parameter @xmath90 is the half charge radius and @xmath91 is related to skin thickness , defined as the interval of the nuclear thickness in which the nuclear charge density falls from near one to near zero .",
