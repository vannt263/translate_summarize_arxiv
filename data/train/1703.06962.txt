    "in this paper we will establish well posedness of the neumann problem in the half - space @xmath2 , with boundary data in the lebesgue space @xmath3 or the sobolev space @xmath4 , for certain elliptic differential operators of the form @xmath5 specifically , we will consider self - adjoint operators associated with coefficients @xmath6 that are @xmath7-independent in the sense that @xmath8    the neumann problem has traditionally been regarded as more difficult than the dirichlet problem . indeed in two important cases ,",
    "well posedness of the dirichlet problem with boundary values in a lebesgue or sobolev space is known , but well posedness of the neumann problem is not : in the case of second order operators with real @xmath7-independent coefficients @xcite and in the case of constant coefficient higher order operators in lipschitz domains @xcite . in the case of higher order operators of the form   with variable @xmath7-independent coefficients , we can bound dirichlet boundary values in a way that we can not at present bound neumann boundary values . see theorem  [ c : thm : rellich ] below .",
    "we will use good behavior of dirichlet boundary values to establish well posedness of the neumann problem ; we can not at present use the same arguments to establish well posedness results for the dirichlet problem because we lack corresponding bounds on the neumann boundary values .",
    "see remark  [ c : rmk : dirichlet : good ] .",
    "indeed , even formulating the higher order neumann problem is a difficult matter . recall that in the second order case , the neumann boundary value of a solution @xmath9 to @xmath10 is the conormal derivative @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the unit outward normal derivative ; this is preferred to the normal derivative @xmath13 because , by the divergence theorem , we have a weak formulation @xmath14 some complexities are already apparent : it is often the case that an operator @xmath15 may be written @xmath16 for more than one choice of coefficient matrix  @xmath6 , and different choices of coefficients @xmath6 lead to different boundary values @xmath17 .    in the second order case",
    ", we can often eliminate this ambiguity , for example by requiring that @xmath6 be self - adjoint . in the second order self - adjoint case the @xmath0-neumann problem with @xmath7-independent coefficients is well posed ; see @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is not self - adjoint , we still do not know whether the neumann problem is well posed , even for second order operators with real @xmath7-independent coefficients .    in the higher order case",
    ", @xmath15 may be associated to multiple self - adjoint coefficient matrices  @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the biharmonic operator @xmath18 may be associated with coefficients @xmath6 such that @xmath19 for any real number  @xmath20 .",
    "notably , the neumann problem for the biharmonic operator ( as studied in @xcite ) is well posed for some values of the parameter @xmath20 and ill posed for others .",
    "thus , we will establish well posedness of the neumann problem under a boundary ellipticity condition ( the bound   below ) that is somewhat more restrictive than the ellipticity condition   standard in the theory .",
    "another complication arises in generalizing the formulation   to the higher order case .",
    "notice the appearance of the dirichlet boundary values @xmath21 of @xmath22 on the left - hand side of formula  .",
    "the neumann boundary values are then dual to the dirichlet boundary values .",
    "thus , different formulations of the dirichlet problem lead to different formulations of the neumann problem .",
    "if we let the dirichlet boundary values of @xmath22 be @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the partial derivative in the normal direction , then a straightforward ( if tedious ) integration by parts yields an analogue to formula   from which the neumann boundary values may be extracted . see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula  ( 1.1.1 ) ) , @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  4.3 ) .",
    "however , it is often convenient to regard @xmath25 as the dirichlet boundary values of  @xmath22 : the various components of @xmath26 may reasonably be expected to all possess the same degree of smoothness , while the lower order derivatives @xmath22 , @xmath27 appearing above may be expected to possess further orders of smoothness .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this is the formulation we shall use in the present paper .",
    "however , this does yield some additional complications , which we shall discuss momentarily .",
    "we now discuss the details of our formulation of neumann boundary values . if @xmath22 is smooth and compactly supported in @xmath28 , and if @xmath29 in @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is connected , and where @xmath32 is locally integrable up to the boundary ,",
    "then @xmath33 depends only on the behavior of @xmath22 near  @xmath31 , and in particular depends only on @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the neumann boundary values of @xmath9 by @xmath34 and say that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "we remark that @xmath34 is an operator on @xmath37 .",
    "this is a _ proper _ subspace of the set of all arrays of smooth , compactly supported functions defined in a neighborhood of  @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is not an array of distributions ; it is an equivalence class of distributions modulo arrays @xmath38 that satisfy @xmath39 for all @xmath36 . if @xmath40 is an array of distributions ( or functions ) defined on  @xmath31 , then the expression @xmath41 represents a slight abuse of notation ; we mean that @xmath40 is a representative of the equivalence class of distributions @xmath34 .",
    "this complication could be avoided by writing the right - hand side as @xmath42 , but then ( as mentioned above ) the various components @xmath43 of @xmath40 would need to possess different orders of smoothness .",
    "our first well posedness result is the following theorem .",
    "[ c : thm : well - posed:2 ] suppose that @xmath15 is an elliptic operator of the form of order  @xmath44 , associated with coefficients @xmath6 that are @xmath7-independent in the sense of formula   and are bounded in the sense of satisfying the bound  .",
    "suppose in addition that @xmath45 satisfies the boundary ellipticity condition and is self - adjoint , that is , that @xmath46 for any @xmath47 and any @xmath48 .",
    "for each @xmath49 there is a solution to the neumann problem with boundary data @xmath40 , that is , a function @xmath50 defined in @xmath2 that satisfies @xmath51 the solution @xmath50 is unique up to adding polynomials of degree  @xmath52 .    in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we intend to show that the solutions  @xmath50 , in addition to satisfying square - function and uniform @xmath0 estimates , also satisfy nontangential maximal estimates .",
    "it is common in the theory of divergence form equations to consider two forms of the dirichlet problem .",
    "the first is the dirichlet problem with boundary data in @xmath0 or ( more generally ) in a lebesgue space  @xmath53 .",
    "the second is the dirichlet regularity problem , that is , the dirichlet problem with boundary data in a boundary sobolev space .",
    "for example , if the matrix @xmath6 in formula   has constant coefficients , and if @xmath30 is a bounded lipschitz domain , then by @xcite and @xcite the dirichlet problem @xmath54 and the regularity problem @xmath55 are well posed . here",
    "@xmath56 is the boundary sobolev space of functions whose tangential gradient lies in  @xmath57 .",
    "notice that the estimates on the solution @xmath50 in the regularity problem just given are very similar to those of theorem  [ c : thm : well - posed:2 ] .",
    "the neumann problem is most often studied in the case where the boundary data lies in a lebesgue space ; generally , the neumann problem then has the same sorts of estimates as the regularity problem .",
    "however , it is also possible to study the neumann problem with boundary data in a negative smoothness space , that is , the dual space to a sobolev space ; the solutions then have the same sort of estimates as the dirichlet problem .",
    "however , generalizing the weak formulation   of neumann boundary values is somewhat problematic given such estimates on  @xmath58 .",
    "recall that we seek solutions @xmath58 that satisfy @xmath59 for such @xmath58 the gradient @xmath60 is not locally integrable up to the boundary of @xmath2 , and so the integral   does not converge absolutely and the formula   for @xmath61 may not be meaningful .",
    "there are several ways to resolve this difficulty .",
    "first , one may consider solutions @xmath58 that satisfy @xmath62 as well as the estimate  ; for such  @xmath58 the integral   converges for all @xmath22 smooth and compactly supported ( and indeed for all @xmath22 with @xmath63 ) .",
    "second , given an array of test functions @xmath64 , one may define the pairing @xmath65 in terms of a specific extension , that is , a particular choice of function @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "we will use the following extension .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is smooth and compactly supported in @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath68 . if @xmath69 , let @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the laplacian taken purely in the horizontal variables . observe that @xmath66 is also smooth on @xmath72 up to the boundary ,",
    "albeit is not compactly supported , and that @xmath73 .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  [ b : thm : neumann:1 ] ) it was shown that , if @xmath58 satisfies the bound , then the integral @xmath74 converges absolutely for any _ fixed _ @xmath75 ( and that the value of this integral is continuous in  @xmath7 ) , and that @xmath76 exists and equals a number whose absolute value is at most @xmath77 thus , for such @xmath58 one may define the neumann boundary values using the extension  @xmath78 .",
    "see formula   below .    by (",
    "* lemma  [ b : lem : neumann : w2 ] ) , if @xmath62 , then the two definitions of neumann boundary values coincide , and so the two ways of studying neumann boundary values of rough solutions are equivalent .",
    "the second main theorem of this work , to be proven via duality with theorem  [ c : thm : well - posed:2 ] , is as follows .",
    "[ c : thm : well - posed:1 ] let @xmath15 be as in theorem  [ c : thm : well - posed:2 ] .",

    "the solution @xmath58 is unique up to adding polynomials of degree  @xmath52 .",
    "we also have a perturbative result .",

    "similarly , if the rough neumann problem for coefficients @xmath82 is well posed in both @xmath2 and @xmath91 , and if @xmath92 is small enough , then the rough neumann problem is well posed for coefficients  @xmath6 as well .",
    "notice that theorems  [ c : thm : well - posed:2 ] and  [ c : thm : well - posed:1 ] concern only operators with self - adjoint coefficients , while theorem  [ c : thm : perturbation ] concerns arbitrary ( non - self - adjoint ) @xmath7-independent coefficients . in particular , combining these three results gives the following corollary .",
