    "recent vlba and merlin observations toward 4 sources show brightness temperatures between @xmath36k , and physical sizes between @xmath37au .",
    "at least two masers show long - term variability ( @xmath381@xmath1year ) , and one maser source was recently shown to exhibit recurrent short - term ( @xmath39 3@xmath1months ) bursts .",
    "all known h@xmath0co @xmath35 cm masers are found in massive star forming regions , and in the case of the three sources that have been studied in detail ( ngc@xmath17538 irs1 , g29.96@xmath100.02 , and iras@xmath118566 + 0408 ; excluding sgr b2 ) the h@xmath0co masers pinpoint the location of candidate disks around massive protostars . however , the h@xmath0co maser mechanism has to be clarified before the masers can be used as an astrophysical probe .",
    "the research on h@xmath0co 6@xmath1 cm masers by the author ( e.a . ) has greatly benefited from collaboration with h. linz , s. kurtz , w. baan , m. sewio , e. churchwell , l. olmi , c. watson , i. hoffman , l.f .",
