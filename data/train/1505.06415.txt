    "there has been growing interest recently , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , in the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the single inclusive production of a hadron or jet at large transverse momentum in lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "in contrast to the far more customary process @xmath2",
    "@xcite , for @xmath0 the scattered lepton in the final state is not observed , so that the process is truly one - hadron ( or one - jet ) inclusive .",
    "the reason for the interest in @xmath0 comes from the study of single transverse - spin phenomena in hadronic scattering processes .",
    "it is well known that large single - spin asymmetries have been observed  @xcite for the process @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes a transversely polarized proton . to explain the large size of the asymmetries , and their persistence all the way from fixed - target to collider energies , has posed a major challenge to theory .",
    "although a lot has been learned , it is fair to say that a fully satisfactory understanding has yet to be obtained . measurements of corresponding asymmetries in the kinematically equivalent , but much simpler , processes @xmath5 , @xmath6 have the promise to shed new light on the mechanisms for single - spin asymmetries in qcd .",
    "first fairly precise experimental data for @xmath5 have recently been released by the hermes  @xcite and jefferson lab hall a  @xcite collaborations .",
    "we note that at first sight one might consider the related process @xmath7 ( which is just the standard inclusive deep - inelastic ( dis ) process ) to be equally suited for transverse - spin studies in lepton scattering . however , the analysis of the corresponding single - spin asymmetry is considerably more complex because higher order qed effects are required for the asymmetry to be non - vanishing  @xcite . in the same spirit as @xmath5 , also the processes @xmath8  @xcite with longitudinal polarization of the lepton and @xmath9  @xcite with a transversely polarized @xmath10 hyperon have been considered in the literature recently .    the proven method for analyzing single - inclusive processes such as @xmath11 or @xmath0 at large transverse momentum rests on qcd perturbation theory and collinear factorization . for single - transverse - spin observables , this involves a twist-3 formalism in terms of three - parton correlation functions of the nucleon or the fragmentation process  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the recent study  @xcite suggests that the twist-3 fragmentation effects could be the dominant source of the observed large transverse - spin asymmetries in @xmath3 .",
    "an alternative approach for describing the single - spin asymmetry in inclusive hadron production in @xmath3 was devised in the context of a `` generalized '' parton model in which the dependence of parton distributions and fragmentation functions on transverse momentum is kept  @xcite .",
    "although no such factorization in transverse momentum is known to be valid for a single - inclusive cross section , the approach has enjoyed considerable phenomenological success .",
    "both the collinear twist-3 approach and the generalized parton model have been used to obtain predictions for the spin asymmetry in @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a leading order ( lo ) twist-3 analysis has been presented in terms of parton correlation functions that were previously extracted from data for @xmath3 .",
    "the results obtained in this way fail to describe the hermes data  @xcite for the spin asymmetries in @xmath5 .",
    "a comparison of perturbative calculations to the corresponding jlab data  @xcite is not possible as the data are for hadrons with transverse momenta below 1  gev .",
    "the lo generalized parton model approach , on the other hand , appears to give results quite consistent with the hermes data  @xcite .    in our view",
    "it is premature to draw any conclusions from these findings at lo . given the kinematics ( and the precision ) of the present data , one may expect higher - order qcd corrections to the cross sections and the asymmetry to be important  @xcite for a meaningful comparison of data and theory .",
    "at least next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections should be included .",
    "we stress that the twist-3 formalism , although so far only developed to lo , offers a well - defined framework for a perturbative study of the transverse - spin asymmetry in @xmath5 .",
    "this is in contrast to the generalized parton model , for which there is likely no systematic way of going to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "that said , nlo calculations within the twist-3 formalism are technically very challenging , and only a few nlo calculations have been performed for the simpler drell - yan  @xcite and semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) cases  @xcite .    in the present paper , we take a first step toward an nlo calculation of the transverse - spin asymmetry for @xmath5 by computing the nlo corrections to the spin - averaged cross section for the process , which constitutes the denominator of the spin asymmetry .",
    "we present analytical results for the nlo partonic cross sections . to our knowledge , despite the vast amount of work performed for lepton proton scattering in the literature ( see , for example  @xcite ) , this calculation has not been presented so far .",
    "we also present similar nlo calculations for the process @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the process @xmath1 has also been extensively studied in terms of the concept of `` 1-jettiness ''  @xcite .",
    "here one additionally writes the cross section differential in a variable @xmath12 that characterizes the hadronic final state that is _ not _ associated with the produced jet or the nucleon beam remnant . in ref .",
    "@xcite the full nlo corrections for the 1-jettiness were computed , where a fully numerical approach was adopted . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to recover our nlo results by performing a ( numerical ) integration over @xmath12 of the results of  @xcite .    because of the propagator of the exchanged photon , the cross section for @xmath5 will contain contributions for which the photon is almost on - shell .",
    "this is not yet the case at lo where the high transverse momentum of the produced hadron requires the photon to be highly virtual . starting from nlo , however",
    ", it may happen that the incoming lepton radiates the photon almost collinearly .",
    "this may then be followed by a @xmath13 scattering process of the photon with a parton in the nucleon , which is perfectly capable of producing the hadron at high @xmath14 . in processes",
    "where the scattered lepton is observed , such as @xmath2 , one can in fact select such contributions by requiring the scattered lepton to have a low scattering angle .",
    "the incoming lepton then effectively acts merely as a source of quasi - real photons , and the process may be very accurately described in terms of a ( perturbative ) distribution function for photons in leptons known as the weizscker - williams ( ww ) distribution  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been widely used with much success in the hera physics program  @xcite .    in the context of our nlo calculation for @xmath0",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether also in this case the contributions by almost real photons dominate and the nlo corrections may be well approximated by a weizscker - williams type distribution . since it is much easier to compute the latter contribution than the full nlo correction , this would mean that one could also obtain approximate nlo results for the transversely polarized cross section within the twist-3 framework by simply considering real photons .",
    "given the complexity of a full nlo calculation for the twist-3 case , this would be a tremendous advantage .",
    "we note that the contributions to the spin - dependent cross sections for @xmath15 for real photons were discussed in  @xcite , including the twist-3 contributions for the single - transverse spin case .",
    "actual lo calculations for the twist-2 longitudinal spin - dependent cross section were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for quasi - real photons .",
    "we will closely examine the contributions by quasi - real photons also in our paper .",
    "their relevance will of course also depend on the lepton species that is used , because the lepton mass leads to a lower limit on the virtuality of the photon .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nlocalc ] we present our nlo calculations for the partonic cross sections for @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",

    "[ concl ] .",

    "we will address these in turn in the following subsections .",
    "one can see from figs .",
    "[ fig : nlorealq2 g ] and  [ fig : nlorealg2q ] that beyond lo there are also new contributions where a gluon fragments or where an initial gluon enters the hard scattering process .",
    "as is well known , all types of nlo contributions develop singularities at intermediate stages of the calculations , which we make manifest by using dimensional regularization with @xmath40 space - time dimensions .",
    "the subsequent treatment of the singularities is standard in pqcd calculations .",
    "the only non - standard feature arises for the incoming lepton . if we assume for the moment that we have an incoming quark instead of a lepton in the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : nlorealq2q ] and an exchanged gluon instead of a photon , then the diagram would make an nlo contribution to , say , @xmath41 . being treated as massless , the initial quark would produce a singularity when it radiates the gluon collinearly .",
    "as is well understood , this singularity may be absorbed ( `` factorized '' ) into the proton s quark pdf , exactly in the same way as for the incoming quark at the bottom of the diagram . in case of an incoming lepton , on the other hand",
    ", the lepton s mass ensures that no collinear singularity arises when the lepton radiates a collinear photon that subsequently participates in the hard scattering .",
    "in fact , keeping the lepton mass @xmath42 , the cross section will develop a logarithmic term of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath10 represents a hard scale of the problem , and in the limit @xmath44 this logarithm precisely produces the required collinear singularity . in principle",
    "we should therefore perform the nlo calculation keeping the lepton mass finite .",
    "this is technically very cumbersome , and in fact not needed .",
    "we can adopt two different , and equivalent , approaches instead : in the first approach we neglect the lepton s mass and regularize the ensuing collinear pole in dimensional regularization .",
    "the pole is then subtracted ( for example , in the @xmath45 scheme ) and absorbed into a `` parton '' distribution function for photons in a lepton .",
    "this distribution may be evaluated perturbatively in first - order qed , giving rise essentially to the well - known `` weizscker - williams '' distribution .",
    "this approach may in principle be extended to higher order in qed . in the second approach ,",
    "we calculate the cross section for a massive lepton , keeping however only the leading terms in @xmath42 which are of the form @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this is justified by the fact that all terms beyond this approximation are suppressed as powers of @xmath42 over the hard scale and hence numerically tiny .",
    "we note that although the logarithm can become large ( as @xmath42 is small compared to typical qcd hard scales ) , the smallness of @xmath37 will usually make the term @xmath47 small enough to be regarded as a perturbative correction .",
    "we will present our main calculation for the case of massless leptons and comment on the use of a finite lepton mass in the calculation later .",

    "the function @xmath53 in the lo cross section  ( [ cslo ] ) expresses the fact that at lo the recoil consists of a single parton .      at the nlo level , the virtual contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlovir ] contribute through their interference with the born diagram .",
    "the virtual contributions thus have born kinematics and are proportional to @xmath54",

    "the real diagrams have @xmath59 topology . to obtain the desired contribution to an inclusive - parton cross section we need to integrate over the phase space of the lepton and the `` unobserved '' parton in the final state .",
    "this can be done in @xmath56 dimensions using the standard techniques available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "after phase space integration , the result for the real - emission contribution for the @xmath60 channel takes the form @xmath61 where both functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 carry a @xmath64-pole , but are well - behaved in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "obviously , the second term in ( [ realq2q1 ] ) requires special care in this limit since the denominator would lead to a non - integrable behavior for @xmath66 .",

    "after the cancelation of infrared singularities between real and virtual contribution , the partonic cross sections still exhibit single poles that reflect collinear singularities arising when an `` observed '' parton ( either the incoming one , or the one that fragments ) becomes collinear with the unobserved parton .",
    "the factorization theorem states that these poles may be absorbed into the parton distribution functions or into the fragmentation functions .",
    "this procedure may be formulated in terms of _ renormalized _ parton densities and fragmentation functions ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "these precisely cancel the collinear poles associated with the observed partons in the nlo partonic cross sections , for all three channels .    even after this procedure , one type of collinear singularity remains .",
    "it is generated by a momentum configuration where the exchanged photon is collinear to the incoming lepton .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of this section , the presence of this singularity is an artifact of neglecting the lepton s mass . in the following two subsections",
    "we discuss our treatment of this issue .",
    "one approach for dealing with the collinear lepton singularity is to introduce bare and renormalized qed parton distributions for the lepton , much in analogy with the procedure that we discussed in the previous section for the nucleon s parton distributions .",

    "dependence on @xmath132 first occurs at nlo .",

    "[ jetpro ] , the first - order weizscker - williams contribution does not depend on @xmath132 .",

    "we have regularized the ensuing collinear singularity in dimensional regularization and then subtracted it by introducing a weizscker - williams type photon distribution in the lepton .",
    "the latter can be computed in qed perturbation theory and effectively reinstates the leading lepton mass dependence , which is logarithmic plus constant . in the second approach , we have kept the lepton mass in the calculation directly , expanding all phase space integrals in such a way that the leading mass dependence is obtained .",
    "both approaches give the same result .",
    "we have presented phenomenological nlo predictions for various experimental setups , from fixed - target experiments ( hermes , jlab , compass ) to collider experiments at an eic .",

    "( [ resq2qnloreal1 ] ) , especially at negative @xmath149 or rapidity .",
    "as is well known , the distributions are associated with the emission of soft gluons .",
    "since they recur with increasing power at every higher order of perturbation theory , it may be worthwhile for future work to address their resummation to all orders , similarly to what was done for the photoproduction case @xmath189 in  @xcite .",
    "the rather large size of the corrections that we find suggests that also the cross section with transverse polarization of the initial nucleon may be subject to large nlo corrections .",
    "this would likely have ramifications for analyses of spin asymmetry data for @xmath190 in terms of twist-3 parton correlation functions .",
    "as full nlo calculations for transverse single - spin observables are difficult , we have also investigated in how far it is possible to match our full nlo result for the spin - averaged cross section by adding just the weizscker - williams contribution to the lo one .",
    "we have found that this simplified approach does not appear to work well quantitatively . in other words",
    ", the nlo corrections do not appear to be dominated by quasi - real photons .",
    "nonetheless , in order to obtain a first estimate of higher - order effects for the transverse - spin asymmetry , it may be worthwhile to use the weizscker - williams contribution for the case of transversely polarized nucleons , which is much simpler to do than the full nlo calculation and was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we again emphasize that our results suggest that contributions by quasi - real photons to the cross sections for the single - inclusive processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ not _ the dominant contributions , at least for large transverse hadron momenta @xmath191 .",
    "in other words , an experimental setup where the final state lepton is not observed in lepton - nucleon collisions does not automatically imply that one measures an ( approximated ) quasi - real photoproduction process .",
    "however , although quasi - real photons do not dominate , they typically do play a non - negligible role for the nlo corrections .",

    "<S> we present next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative - qcd calculations of the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of these processes is that the scattered lepton is not observed , so that the hard scale that makes them perturbative is set by the transverse momentum of the hadron or jet . </S>",
    "<S> kinematically , the two processes thus become direct analogs of single - inclusive production in hadronic collisions which , as has been pointed out in the literature , makes them promising tools for exploring transverse spin phenomena in qcd when the incident nucleon is transversely polarized . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nlo corrections are sizable for the spin - averaged cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate in how far the scattering is dominated by the exchange of almost real ( weizscker - williams ) photons . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical estimates of the cross sections for present - day fixed target experiments and for a possible future electron ion collider . </S>"
