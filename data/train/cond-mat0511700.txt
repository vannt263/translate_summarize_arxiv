    "( [ mott ] ) and ( [ fermino ] ) one arrives at the conclusion that in the mott regime ( @xmath85 ) , hcb noise correlations with central peak height equal to @xmath101 differ from the corresponding spin correlations which show no central peak .",

    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the quantum coherence of hcb , spin and fermions as characterized by @xmath107 .",
    "our calculations show that for hcb as well as for spin systems noise correlations exhibit characteristic peaks at every reciprocal lattice vector for all filling factors .",
    "these peaks reflect the underlying order induced by the periodic lattice .",
    "the heights of the peak vary with the filling factor ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the peaks are a manifestation of the boson nature of the atoms and are induced by interactions as they disappear in the non - interacting regime where all of the atoms are bose - condensed . for fractional values of @xmath82 , the peaks are accompanied by a small satellite dip at @xmath108 immersed in a negative background",
    ". in other words , the dips occur only in the compressible phase .",
    "these dips are present only for non - integer filling factor and are a manifestation of the quasi - long range coherence of the system .",
    "it turns out that bogoliubov theory @xcite is helpful in gaining insight into the the dips and the negative background in the hcb noise correlations .",
    "the theory describes the weakly interacting regime and in principle can not be used to quantitatively describe the hcb gas .",
    "however , some aspects of the theory survive in hcb limit and suggest a possible mechanism for the dips and the negative background that characterize the compressible regime .",
    "the bogoliubov approximation predicts the negative background @xmath109 and the satellite dip at low quasi - momenta ( phonon regime ) . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath110",
    "diverges as @xmath111 . for finite lattices",
    "the height of the satellite dip does not diverge but scales like @xmath112 .",
    "moreover in the bogoliubov approximation the central peak scales like @xmath113 $ ] so the peak to dip ratio remains finite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the insensitivity of this ratio to the lattice size is also seen in hcb case .",
    "the negative background , @xmath114 , and the satellite dip at low quasi - momenta can also be qualitatively understood as follows : @xmath110 can be written as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of condensate atoms , @xmath117 is the number of atoms with quasi - momenta @xmath118 ( the population of which comprises the quantum depletion ) and @xmath119 is the amplitude of the state @xmath120 , with @xmath121 the many - body ground state .",
    "@xmath122 represents the process of removing a particle from the condensate and one from the state with quasi - momentum @xmath118 . in the absence of interactions",
    "all of the atoms are bose condensed , correlations can be neglected and @xmath123 . on the other hand , interactions dramatically change the behavior of the bose gas .",
    "collisions between zero - quasimomentum atoms admix into the condensate pairs of atoms at quasimomenta @xmath124 . as a result",
    "pair excitations in the condensate become correlated so as to minimize the total energy of the system giving rise to the negative sign in the noise correlations .",
    "for high quasi - momenta the interference plays a minor role but in the phonon regime @xmath125 diverges and the anti - correlations are maximal .    as mentioned above for hcb bosons",
    "bogoliubov theory is not qualitatively valid but it still gives a useful physical picture as the hcb ground state also exhibits off - diagonal quasi - long - range order that manifests in the power law decay of the density matrix and the macroscopic occupation of the zero quasi - momentum state ( quasi - condensate ) which scales like @xmath126 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "5 ) .    in fig .  2",
    "we study the dependence of the peak and dip height with the filling factor for hcb and the correspondent spin system .",
    "as illustrated there the heights ( @xmath127 ) and the dips ( @xmath128 ) of the peaks increase with the filling factor up to a maximum value and then begin to decrease . at @xmath85 , for hcb , the height approaches @xmath101 while the dip vanishes ( @xmath129 ) .",

    "these results were confirmed for various lattice sizes as well as for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the asymmetric behavior implies that the noise correlations for hcb do not preserve particle hole symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the satellite dip appears to preserve it .",
    "the asymmetry in hcb correlations has its roots in the mov states as the spin correlations ( which do not have mov ) preserves the particle - hole symmetry .",

    "it is important to mention that , in general , different observables do not have to preserve the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the momentum distribution for spins has an explicit dependence on the density and is not completely symmetric around @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless as shown in fig .",
    "2 , noise - correlations do preserve the particle hole - symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "our detailed numerics shows that the heights of the peaks and the dips depend upon the lattice size and are expected to diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , our simulations also suggest that the ratio of height to dip is size independent ( behavior also observed in the bogoliubov calculations ) for various filling factors .",
    "in particular for hcb the ratio near the maxima of the central peak is found to approach @xmath145 ( see fig .",
    "the scale invariance of this ratio makes it a more desirable physical quantity that can be compared in different experiments .",
    "the striking differences between the spins and the hcb noise correlations not only highlight the importance of including mov states but also explicitly show that a direct mapping between the two systems is not valid for all observables .",

    "<S> noise correlations , such as those observable in the time of flight images of a released cloud , are calculated for hard - core bosonic ( hcb ) atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the standard mapping of hcb systems onto spin-@xmath0 xy models fails in application to computation of noise correlations due to the contribution of _ multiply occupied virtual states _ in hcb systems . </S>",
    "<S> such states do not exist in spin models . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting manifestation of such states is the breaking of particle - hole symmetry in hcb . </S>",
    "<S> we use noise correlations to explore quantum coherence of strongly correlated bosons in the fermionized regime with and without external parabolic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis points to distinctive new experimental signatures of the mott phase .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , great experimental progress has been achieved in the coherent control of ultra - cold gases , which has been used to attain laboratory demonstrations of iconic model quantum many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by loading a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) into a tight two - dimensional optical lattice , an array of one - dimensional tubes has been created @xcite . using this setup , </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have been able to successfully enter the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime @xcite predicted many years ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by using an additional one - dimensional optical lattice in the direction of the tubes , a one - dimensional mott insulator ( mi ) state with unit filling has been realized experimentally @xcite . in the tg limit </S>",
    "<S> , bosons behave like impenetrable particles - hard - core bosons ( hcb ) - and their dynamics are equivalent in many respects to those of a system of fermions . in this paper , we calculate four - point correlation functions of hcb and the corresponding spin-@xmath0 and fermion systems .    experimental access to such correlation functions has recently been achieved @xcite by analysis of spatial ( noise ) correlations in shot - noise - limited images of expanded atomic clouds , following the original suggestion of altman _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the case of bosons in a three - dimensional mi state , these noise correlations have been proven to complement the standard , first - order , characterization of phase coherence that is expressed by the direct image of the density of the expanded gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations have also been used to probe pair correlations of fermionic atoms generated by molecular dissociation @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a theoretical framework to compute noise correlations for hcb systems confined in a one - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of this hcb system is related to that of the spin-@xmath0 xy model , which in turn can be mapped onto the hamiltonian of a spinless fermion system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these three systems have identical spectra and local observables , but their off - diagonal correlation functions differ . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally relevant two - point correlation functions are identical for hcb and spin-@xmath0 systems , and the general formulation to calculate these correlations was developed by lieb and mattis @xcite , based on wick s theorem . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> explicit formulae to calculate higher order correlations have not been worked out previously , except in certain asymptotic limits @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we calculate all four - point correlation functions and use them to compute noise correlations . </S>",
    "<S> one of the central results of this paper is the discovery of important differences between noise correlation functions of hcb and spin-@xmath0 systems . </S>",
    "<S> the root of this difference is the bosonic character of hcb that allows for _ multiple occupancy of the virtual states _ ( mov ) even though the ground state is at most singly occupied . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to spin-@xmath0 systems whose hilbert space excludes multiple occupancy of all states . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the standard lieb and mattis @xcite formulation for spin @xmath0 systems can still be utilized for calculating correlations functions in hcb systems provided the operators are written in normal order form by using boson commutation rules , before applying any transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that mov states are responsible for various differences between the hcb and the xy spin-@xmath0 correlations . </S>",
    "<S> one particular way to characterize this difference is the particle - hole symmetry : in hcb noise correlations , this symmetry is broken while it is preserved in the corresponding spin systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the noise correlations to characterize quantum coherence in both homogeneous lattice systems and systems subject to external parabolic confinement , as is often the case in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of noise correlations have been carried out in the mi limit @xcite ; our analysis extends this understanding into the strongly correlated ( fermionized ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , _ independent of the filling factor of the system _ , hcb exhibit second order coherence . </S>",
    "<S> it is manifested by peaks in the noise shot images which reflect the order induced by the lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that second order coherence in noise correlations is a generic attribute of correlated bosonic systems ; as was also noted in earlier studies in a different context @xcite , such coherence does not merely signal reduced number fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> our detailed study involving all fillings factors highlights distinctions between the mott regime and the compressible regime . in the mi limit , </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the density - density correlations between any two points separated by a reciprocal lattice vector is constant . in the compressible phase , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the corresponding noise correlations depend strongly on the spatial position in the image . </S>",
    "<S> thus a regular pattern in noise correlations could serve as a definite signature of the mott phase . additionally , the peaks of noise correlations in the compressible phase are accompanied by satellite dips immersed in a negative background . </S>",
    "<S> these dips are suppressed in the insulating phase .    in section </S>",
    "<S> i , we discuss various hamiltonians related to hcbs and describe noise correlations that can be measured in experiments involving cold atoms in optical lattices . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we develop the theoretical framework needed to calculate all four point correlation functions relevant for computing noise correlations . in view of the relationships among hcb , xy spin-@xmath0 , and spinless fermion models , we develop explicit formulas to calculate noise correlations for all of them . in section iii </S>",
    "<S> , we use the formulation of section ii to study noise correlations for a spatially homogeneous gas of hcb . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss their basic properties and describe in detail how the strengths of the peaks and dips depend upon the filling factors . </S>",
    "<S> our detailed numerical studies suggest that although the peak and dip amplitudes depend upon the size of the system , the peak to dip ratio is size independent . </S>",
    "<S> we compare noise correlations for hcb , spin-@xmath0 xy chains , and the corresponding fermionic systems , and show that the spin noise correlations preserve the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian , but that this symmetry is broken in hcbs . in section iv , we compute the noise correlations for experimentally relevant parameters and compare results for mott vs. compressible phases . </S>",
    "<S> section v summarizes our results . </S>"
