    "<S> manipulation and detection of nuclear spins have attracted much interests in research field of low - dimensional semiconductor systems ever since the proposed use of nuclear spins as solid - state quantum bits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) is one of the essential techniques to initialize nuclear - spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> so far , coherent manipulation of solid - state nuclear spins has been demonstrated in several low - dimensional semiconductor systems using different kinds of dnp techniques@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they utilize spin - flip process of electrons associated with electron scatterings between spin - resolved quantum hall edge channels@xcite , inter - domain scatterings between spin - polarized and -unpolarized domain structures in fractional quantum hall systems@xcite , and spin - selective excitation of electrons by circularly polarized laser beam irradiation@xcite . in these dnp techniques , </S>",
    "<S> nuclear spins are polarized by the flip - flop process of electron spins @xmath0 and nuclear spins @xmath1 in the hyperfine interaction , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hyperfine constant .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we report our novel method for coherent manipulation of nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> we initialize nuclear spins located at the interface of gaas / algaas heterostructure by a dnp technique using breakdown of integer quantum hall effect ( qhe)@xcite . then , the nuclear - spin states are manipulated by irradiation of radio - frequency ( rf ) pulse magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the manipulated nuclear - spin states are read out by standard dc voltage measurements of the quantum hall conductor . by changing the rf - pulse width </S>",
    "<S> , we observe coherent evolution of the nuclear - spin states , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the rabi oscillation .    </S>",
    "<S> we study a hall - bar device fabricated from a wafer of gaas / algaas single heterostructue with two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface . the electron mobility and the carrier density are 220  m@xmath4/vs and 1.6  @xmath5  10@xmath6  m@xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](a ) shows an optical micrograph of the hall - bar device . </S>",
    "<S> the central part of the hall bar is covered with a 10-@xmath8m - wide ti / au metal strip . </S>",
    "<S> the metal strip is used to apply rf - magnetic fields @xmath9 to the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> all the measurements were performed using a standard dc four - terminal method in a @xmath10he-@xmath11he dilution refrigerator at about 50  mk .    in order to initialize the nuclear - spin state </S>",
    "<S> , we use a dnp technique utilizing breakdown of quantum hall effect developed in our earlier study@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qhe breakdown is a phenomenon in which a dissipationless quantum hall state is broken by applying a bias current above a critical value @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> when the quantum hall state is broken , electrons condensed in the landau levels are excited to the upper landau level , giving rise to an abrupt increase in longitudinal voltage @xmath13 . in a case of odd - integer qhe , </S>",
    "<S> the electron excitations involve up - to - down spin flips . </S>",
    "<S> the up - to - down flips of electron spins cause to flop nuclear spins upward through the hyperfine interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the polarized nuclear spins reduce the spin - splitting energy @xmath14 , where g is the g - factor for electrons ( = @xmath15 in gaas ) and @xmath16 is the bohr magneton . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this process accelerates the qhe breakdown , leading to an increase in @xmath13 and hysteretic @xmath13-@xmath17 characteristic curves@xcite . as demonstrated in our earlier experiment@xcite , nuclear spins in the bulk part of the quantum hall conductor </S>",

    "<S> the down - sweep curve appears on the small current side of the up - sweep curve . </S>",
    "<S> clear hysteresis is observed above @xmath17 = 100  na . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath17 is switched from 0  na to 200  na , the value of @xmath13 increases gradually over 600  s as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) . by applying continuous - wave rf - magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectrum with a dip structure at a frequency of 71.346  mhz [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) ] , which is the nmr frequency for @xmath20ga at this magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> nmr spectra for @xmath21ga and @xmath22as were also obtained . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with our earlier experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the amplitude of the in - plane component of @xmath9 ( perpendicular to @xmath19 ) is strong only in the region beneath the metal strip , nuclear spins located under the metal strip are relevant to the nmr spectrum .     </S>",

    "<S> , width=377 ]    combining the above dnp technique with the pulse nmr technique , we manipulate @xmath20ga nuclei coherently : first , nuclear spins are polarized upward using the above - described dnp technique utilizing the qhe breakdown . then , rf - magnetic field with pulse duration @xmath23 ( 0 @xmath26 @xmath23 @xmath26 1 ms ) are applied at @xmath24 = 0  s. a representative time evolution of @xmath13 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) for @xmath23 = 80  @xmath8s . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath13 decreases abruptly after the irradiation of a rf pulse and recovers to the initial value in a time scale of several tens of seconds . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage drop after the rf - pulse irradiation ( at @xmath24 = 5  s ) is denoted as @xmath25 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) .    by repeating the above procedure with different @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a gray - scale plot of @xmath13 as functions of @xmath23 and measurement time @xmath24 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath25 oscillates periodically as a function of @xmath23 as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this oscillation corresponds to the coherent evolution of nuclear - spin states , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the rabi oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the rabi oscillation in the present work is more than 10 times larger than that in our previous experiment@xcite , in which a hall - bar device with shorter channel length was used . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the oscillations were almost the same even at higher temperatures up to 1.5 k.    the oscillation decays gradually with a time scale of about 300  @xmath8s , which is rather short for a coherence time of a nuclear spin system in gaas . </S>",
    "<S> the short decay time is probably attributed to the rather broad nmr spectrum ( 30 khz in fwhm ) . since @xmath20ga nucleus has a spin of @xmath17 = 3/2 , we suspect that the electric quadrupole interaction causes the broad spectrum .    </S>",
