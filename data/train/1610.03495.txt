    "we can see that the dashed line covers the regions where sfgs and composites locate , separating seyfert2s from sfgs and composites .",

    "seyfert2s occupy the bright and massive end of figure  4 .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings that seyfert2s reside exclusively in massive , luminous galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "even though the host of seyfert2s are luminous and massive , the overlap between seyfert2s and star - forming galaxies on these two plots is large compared with that on the kex diagram .",
    "4.2% ( 246/5860 ) of sy2s are on the mex - sf side , while 3.2% ( 186/5860 ) of sy2s are on the kex - sf side .",

    "the fraction of bpt - classified seyferts that are mis - classified as sfgs are higher on these two diagrams than on the kex diagram .",
    "there is an additional enhancement in @xmath2}}$ ] at fixed luminosity or stellar mass for agns relative to sfgs .",
    "this enhancement helps agns separate further from sfgs on the kex diagram . in figure  5 , we plot the median @xmath12 derived from five emission lines against @xmath29 and stellar mass in the left and right panels .",

    "the errors are calculated using the bootstrap method .",
    "we can see that at a given luminosity where both agns and sfgs cover , the @xmath2}}$ ] of seyfert2s is on average 0.15  dex higher than star - forming galaxies . and at a given stellar mass , seyfert2s are 0.12  dex higher than star - forming galaxies .",
    "these offsets are critical to the clean separation between seyfert2s and star - forming galaxies on the kex diagram .",
    "other emission lines gave similar results .",
    "one reason of the difference in @xmath2}}$ ] may be that the emission lines in seyfert2s are produced by gas in the narrow line region which extend into the bulge and the emission line in star - forming galaxies are emitted by gas in the hii  region in the disk .",
    "the matter distribution and kinematics are very different in the disk and bulge of a galaxy it is shown in catinella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that at a given luminosity or baryon mass , the disk dominated galaxy show 0.1  dex smaller @xmath32 ( measured from the sdss 3 \" fiber ) than the bulge dominated galaxies . at a given mass ,",
    "the bulge dominated galaxies , which are more concentrated , show a higher @xmath32 than the disk dominated galaxies . besides the difference in host galaxies ,",
    "several other physical reasons may be involved in the fact that seyfert2s have broader emission lines .",
    "greene & ho ( 2005 ) found that the excess [ oiii ]  line width relative to the stellar or lower ionization lines kinematics is about 30 - 40% ( 0.11 - 0.15 dex ) , with small variations depending on agn luminosity , agn eddington ratio , sfr , etc .",
    "when considering only the core of [ oiii ] , the excess in [ oiii ]  line width goes away ( green & ho 2005 , komossa et al .",
    "this supports that the [ oiii ]  core is produced by ionized gas in bulge while another source of broadening related to agn ( such as possibly winds or outflows from accretion disk ) is at work .",
    "radio jet may play a part in broadening the emission line too ( mullaney et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the differences in @xmath12 and @xmath33 between agns and sfgs are more pronounced against @xmath29 than against m*. in particular , @xmath32 is significantly higher in agn hosts at a fixed @xmath29 but not so different at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "this means that agn hosts have higher mass - to - light ratios , which can be interpreted as having more important bulge components .",
    "more massive bulges host more massive black holes , and therefore be detectable as seyfert 2s down to lower eddington ratios .",
    "conversely , lower mass agns are only identified as seyfert 2s for comparatively higher eddington ratios and their [ oiii ]  line width excess could be more pronounced relative to other lines than for higher mass agns if the eddington ratio is the driving factor for additional broadening ( e.g. , greene & ho 2005 ; ho 2008 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the boundary between star - forming galaxies / composites and agns on the kex diagram is defined by the tully - fisher relation of the most luminous and massive galaxies .",
