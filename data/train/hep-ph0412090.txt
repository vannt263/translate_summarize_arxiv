    "we discuss these models in section 2 . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we analyze neutrino masses and mixings in the alternative left - right and inert models , respectively .",

    "note that the sm ( active ) neutrino gets dirac mass from the same source as the up quark .",

    "the neutral fermion mass matrix has similarities with that of the alr model .",

    "the secular equation becomes @xmath115 where there are two eigenvalues @xmath116 which are exact ( unlike the alr model ) .",
    "diagonalization of the mass matrix gives the following eigenvalues , under the assumption @xmath117 @xmath118 it is clear from the alr symmetric model results that there will be two very heavy neutrinos , one very light neutrino , and two neutrinos with masses of the scale of up quark mass .",
    "the lightest neutrino is @xmath119 solutions to the neutrino mass problem --------------------------------------    as shown in the last two sections , both alr and inert models ( as well as the conventional lr symmetric model ) have a dirac neutrino mass problem at the first stage .",
    "this seems to be a general feature of string - inspired low - energy @xmath0 models .",
    "both models under consideration predict that the lightest neutrino state , while having a reasonable mass , is composed of @xmath1 singlets .",
    "furthermore , in their neutral fermion spectrum , there are neutrino eigenstates having masses of the order of the up quark mass ( or the electron mass for the conventional lr model ) .",
    "there are three methods discussed in the literature to rectify this latter neutrino mass problem",
    ". the smallness of the neutrino masses can be achieved by introducing a discrete symmetry ( the ds method ) @xcite , or by including a non - renormalizable higher - order dimensional operators ( the hdo method ) @xcite , or using light @xmath0 singlet fields ( the additional neutral fermion ( anf ) method ) @xcite .",
    "we discuss the features of the models under consideration for each of these three methods .",
    "as we will see , the predictions are quite different .",
    "the ds method is the most attractive method among them as it does nt require any further particles or the existence of some intermediate scale .",
    "however , it does not help in non - susy framework ( at least for the simplest discrete symmetry ) without introducing many additional particles .",
    "the hdo method will offer a partial solution but _ does not predict any light sterile neutrino(s ) _ and requires new higgs fields from @xmath120 representation of @xmath0 , and the existence of some intermediate scale , which further breaks the gauge groups of the model .",
    "the anf method works well for predicting the lightest state with sterile neutrino(s ) mixing and can explain the lsnd result .",
    "however , the method requires a discrete symmetry as well as new neutral @xmath0 fermion fields , and a pair of @xmath121 split higgs multiplets whose vev s do not require hierarchical separation .      following the above discussion , the discrete symmetry ( ds ) method is the most economical .",
    "the symmetry transformation which is introduced should restrict the existence of the dirac mass term @xmath122 at tree level in the lagrangian ( eqs .",
    "( [ alryukawa ] ) and ( [ inertyukawa ] ) ) while allowing couplings so that one - loop radiative corrections can be used to generate naturally small dirac masses for neutrinos ( although it may be necessary to put some upper limits for products of some yukawa couplings ) .",
    "the symmetry should also avoid rapid proton decay .",
    "in the supersymmetric versions of both the alr symmetric and the inert model , there exist leptoquark couplings mediated by @xmath123 and @xmath36 particles and these couplings are needed to induce nonzero one - loop neutrino mass . since we do not consider the existence of the higgs fields carrying @xmath31 color , there is no direct analogy in non - susy scenarios coming from the supersymmetrized versions of the models . it should be noted that the rapid proton decay is not an issue .",
    "an example of such a symmetry , which was considered within the susy framework of the general @xmath0 model @xcite is @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath125 in that case was related to susy , and in this non - susy framework a simple @xmath126 will suffice .",
    "it is not difficult to see that such symmetries must be able to differentiate between generations as long as a non - zero one - loop dirac neutrino mass is generated while at the same time eliminating the tree level mass term ( see @xcite for details ) .    in both models considered here ,",
    "tree level masses of both the neutrinos and the up quark are obtained from the higgs field with vev @xmath127 .",

    "we see that the hdo method solves the problems in both models , under the assumption that there exists an intermediate scale at the order of @xmath189 gev and both @xmath212 and @xmath213 get vev s at that scale .",
    "since there is only one light state ( per generation , of course ) , there is no sterile neutrino in the model .",
    "the @xmath202 only couples to the @xmath167 , and which is very heavy , the net effect of the mixing ( in either the alr or inert model ) will be to lower the coupling of the electron neutrino to the electron and @xmath214-boson . for the alr case ( the inert case is basically the same ) ,",
    "the coupling is reduced by a factor of @xmath215 .",
    "since the mixing must be small , @xmath216 , and this factor then becomes @xmath217 .",
    "this reduction would give a very clear signature for the model .",
    "the electron neutrino would not oscillate into a sterile neutrino ( ignoring inter - generational mixing ) , and yet its coupling is reduced relative to the standard model .",
    "similar reductions would occur for the muon and tau neutrino interactions .",
    "the phenomenological implications of this reduction will be discussed in the next section .      in some @xmath218-based superstring - based models , such as those with calabi - yau compactification , in addition to the @xmath16 and @xmath120 representations of @xmath0 for the matter multiplets ,",
    "there typically exist split multiplets , parts of the @xmath219 representations , as well as some @xmath0 singlets @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "we have already considered the existence of such higgs multiplets by considering @xmath120 components of the above @xmath219 representation inducing dimension-5 terms ( of the form discussed in the previous subsection ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath221 and the higher - dimensional @xmath222 types of interactions , we may have @xmath223 type of interactions as well .",
    "the additional neutral fermion ( anf ) method follows this approach .",
    "the existence of @xmath0 singlets ( and thus the @xmath223 interactions ) has been discussed in different context of the superstring models @xcite to tackle the rapid proton decay problem , large neutrino mass problem and others . in order to give light neutrino masses consistent with present experimental observations ,",
    "the additional higgs fields are required to have vev s chose in a strong hierarchical way , which seems unnatural .",
    "such an odd pattern , however , is not necessary in the non - susy versions of the models discussed here .",
    "we discuss the method in the alr symmetric model and later point out the difference with the inert model .    in the alr model ,",
    "we consider one additional @xmath0 neutral fermion singlet even when we extend our discussion to the three generation case later in this section . ]",
    "@xmath224 , and one pair of @xmath219 higgs multiplets @xmath225 ( the betti - hodge number @xmath226 ) .",
    "we do not include a corresponding @xmath219 chiral fermion multiplet relevant for supersymmetrized versions of the models considered in future studies .",
    "let us assume that both @xmath177 and @xmath227 have @xmath228-like and @xmath229-like components @xmath230 . since we do nt want to alter the interactions in the @xmath221 sector discussed earlier , we assume that only @xmath231 get nonzero vev s and further , that there is a @xmath125 discrete symmetry under which all fields except @xmath232 and @xmath231 have even charges . therefore , two additional gauge invariant interactions for one generation survive of the form @xmath233 then , the mass matrix in the neutral fermion sector in the ( @xmath234 ) basis can be obtained directly by adding a column and a row for @xmath224 field to the one given in eq .",
    "( [ matrixalr ] ) @xmath235 where we define @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the eigenvalues can be found by following the same methodology as before and under the assumption @xmath238 ( we assume @xmath239 ) giving @xmath240 now , we have two light eigenvalues @xmath241 .",
    "the masses of these states can be approximated as @xmath242 and could possibly be in the experimentally favored region while obeying the the experimental bounds on @xmath243 mixing .",
    "it is straightforward to get the mass eigenstates corresponding to the above eigenvalues .",
    "the transformation matrix equation from mass to flavor eigenstates is given by @xmath244 where @xmath96 and @xmath245 are given in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvaluesanf ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath246 is arbitrary in the model , but it would be fixed both by the requirement that the coupling of @xmath214 to neutrinos and leptons must be in agreement with the experimental data and by the required mixing angle between active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath247 respectively are heavy and irrelevant to our discussion at low energies .",
    "there are two light mass eigenstates of the form @xmath248 the above results apply to the inert group , with an additional constraint coming from @xmath44 symmetry . since @xmath88 and @xmath104 form an @xmath44 doublet , the couplings @xmath249 and @xmath250 are required to be equal .    thus , we have two interesting features of the model .",
    "the slight suppression of the coupling of the active neutrino discusssed in the last subsection is present .",
    "however , now we _ also _ have a sterile neutrino with an arbitrary mixing angle with the active neutrino .",
    "this model could then easily accommodate the lsnd result ( if confirmed by miniboone ) .",
    "with the addition of only one singlet , for simplicity , there are three active neutrinos . in this case ,",
    "@xmath251 and @xmath249 have generation indices .",
    "each active neutrino has a light mass , and will mix with an arbitrary mixing angle with the sterile neutrino . note that in the single - generation case , the two light mass eigenstates are , to leading order , identical .",
    "thus , if the mixing angle is small for two of the three generations , we will have a @xmath252 structure , whereas if it is sizeable for all three generations , there will be a @xmath253 structure . of course , one could introduce several singlet fields , giving more complicated structures .",
    "if the lsnd result is confirmed by miniboone , the existence of sterile neutrino(s ) at low energies might be unavoidable .",
    "thus is it important to analyze extensions of the standard model which predict the existence of extra neutral fermions , and verify that they have the desired experimental features .",
    "though we have explicitly considered here the @xmath0 subgroups , @xmath254 ( alr ) and @xmath255 ( inert ) , and concentrated on the neutrino spectrum in non - susy framework , our work is valid for the @xmath256 ( lr ) group as well .",
    "these models predict several exotic neutral fermions .",
    "we have shown that both the alr and inert models generally predict neutrino sectors inconsistent with current observations .",
    "the lightest state turns out to contain only @xmath1 singlets ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) which do not interact with sm particles . additionally , in contradiction with present experimental observations , two more light neutrino states with masses around the up quark mass exist .",
    "the main reason for such a spectrum is the existence of tree level dirac mass term in the lagrangian . we have discussed three possible remedies to this problem .    the most attractive one is the discrete symmetry ( ds ) method which only requires imposing an extra symmetry .",
    "the aim is to eliminate the tree level dirac mass term by assigning suitable charges to the fields under some discrete symmetries , and generate dirac neutrino masses through radiative corrections .",
    "the discrete symmetry needs to distinguish generations .",
    "as discussed earlier , there is no way to induce a non - zero one - loop dirac mass while eliminating the tree level term .",
    "the only way out is to have a @xmath1 higgs doublet ( a part of the bidoublet ) with vanishing vev . for this",
    ", we considered the simplest symmetry , @xmath126 .",
    "it leads to dirac masses from one - loop diagrams which are estimated around @xmath161 ev , by imposing an upper bound to the product of the yukawa couplings of the order of @xmath257 .",
    "it is also possible to generate very light majorana masses for @xmath164 and @xmath103 .",
    "since these masses are much smaller than the dirac mass term for @xmath88 , a spectrum with pseudo - dirac neutrinos is obtained .    the higher dimensional operators ( hdo ) ,",
    "the second method , requires additional higgs fields from @xmath258-plet of @xmath0 and the existence of some intermediate scale .",
    "we introduce interactions which are suppressed by one power of the compactification scale , through dimension-5 operators .",
    "the method solves the mass problems but does not predict any sterile neutrino component(s ) in the lightest neutrino state , which is an admixture of @xmath88 and @xmath202 .",
    "the effect of the mixing will be to lower the electron neutrino coupling to the electron and the @xmath214 boson by a factor of @xmath259 , where @xmath260 .",
    "the reduction for the muon and tau neutrino interactions will be given by the same expression , with @xmath261 being replaced by @xmath262 and @xmath263 ( which depend on different @xmath264 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "the phenomenological implications are interesting .",
    "if the @xmath265 are different , then @xmath266 universality will be violated in neutrino interactions . by comparing the muon decay rate and the rate for leptonic tau decays",
    ", one finds @xcite that the reductions of @xmath267 can not differ by more than @xmath268 .",
    "even if the @xmath265 are all the same , however , one would still find a discrepancy in , for example , @xmath269 vs. @xmath270 , which would depend on @xmath262 , with a similar dependence on the electronic decay .",
    "comparing all of these bounds , we find that none of the reductions can exceed @xmath268 , leading to a bound , for each generation , of @xmath271 , which is not particularly fine - tuned .",
    "a more detailed study comparing many hadronic decays with the leptonic decays of the @xmath272 could lead to a somewhat more precise bound ( or , better yet , an indication of a discrepancy ) .",
    "the last method we have discussed is the additional neutral fermion ( anf ) , which requires the existence of both new particles and discrete symmetries .",
    "if one considers an @xmath0 singlet field , the additional interactions will be of the type @xmath273 , which further require additional higgs doublets from the @xmath274 representation . in order not to alter already existing couplings ,",
    "the vev s of the new fields need to be chosen suitably , together with an additional @xmath125 symmetry . under these circumstances",
    "we obtain two light states given in eq .",
    "( [ lightanf ] ) .",
    "the neutrino states have an active neutrino part of exactly the form predicted by the hdo method , but this time they mix with a sterile flavor state ( formed by @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "the mixing is completely arbitrary .",
    "if we extend the picture to three generations , the model contains two structures , @xmath275 and @xmath276 , which have been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "when the above mixing is sizable only for one generation , only the @xmath275 structure arises naturally , since the states in eq .",
    "( [ lightanf ] ) are degenerate in the leading order . otherwise , @xmath276 is possible .",
    "more realistically , when we include three generations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we obtain a @xmath277 structure .",
    "recent analyses show that neither @xmath275 nor @xmath276 provide a good description of the combined atmospheric , solar , reactor , and accelerator data even though it appears that @xmath276 works better . however , there is no consensus about whether the scenarios with four neutrinos are ruled out or not @xcite . from our considerations ,",
    "the anf method allows both @xmath278 or @xmath277 structures , which enhance the effects in favor of lsnd data @xcite .",
