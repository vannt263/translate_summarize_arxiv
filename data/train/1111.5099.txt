    "direct detection and spectral characterization of exo - planets is one of the most exciting challenges of modern astronomy . over the past decade",
    ", the field of high contrast imaging has been extremely active , and a variety of solutions for space based imaging of earth twins have been proposed and tested . among these concepts , the phase induced amplitude apodisation coronagraph , first introduced by , is a promising solution since it makes most of the photons collected by the primary mirror of the telescope available for planet detection and characterization .",
    "this technique is based on two aspherical mirrors that redistribute the light in the pupil plane of a telescope so that it follows a given amplitude profile , creating a point spread function ( psf ) with contrast levels close to @xmath0 .",
    "because all the light collected is remapped using these mirrors , such a coronagraph has virtually no throughput loss . as a consequence ,",
    "the angular resolution is undiminished and is close to the diffraction limit of @xmath1 , a feature comparable to the performances of a phase mask coronagraph , such as the optical vortex coronagraph ( @xcite ) , but without any transmissive optics .",
    "unfortunately , these conclusions are based on a geometrics optics analysis ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discovered that when a full diffraction analysis is applied to the system , the envisioned designs do not yield the expected level of extinction , but rather , at best , @xmath2 contrast .    in order to mitigate these diffractive effects , @xcite devised a method using pre -and post - apodisers to retrieve a @xmath0 contrast even while accounting for diffraction .",
    "they verified , using a very accurate numerical integrator , that apodised piaa coronagraphs could be designed to have performances close to the ones predicted by ray optics . in the absence of apodizing screens , another avenue to mitigate for propagation induced artifacts is to treat them as wavefront errors and compensate for them with one or two deformable mirrors ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the first solution , apodizing screens , will reduce the throughput of the coronagraph , and thus the efficiency of the instrument , but preserve the spectral bandwidth .",
    "the second alternative , wavefront control , will preserve throughput but lead to a reduced spectral bandwidth since the diffractive oscillations are highly chromatic and can not be fully compensated by deformable mirrors . in this communication",
    "we treat only the former design approach , where diffractive effects are mitigated by pre- and post - apodizers . in this paper",
    "we extend the theoretical framework of @xcite and @xcite by developing an analytical formalism for the diffractive effects on arbitrary geometries .",
    "these results are not only useful for a qualitative understanding of pupil mapping coronagraphs , but are also critical for the design of such solutions , @xcite , for numerical studies pertaining to their sensitivities to aberrations , @xcite , and for understanding how to integrate with wavefront control systems , @xcite .",
    "we apply these findings to pursue alternate designs of piaa coronagraphs , and focus on the particularly interesting case of square apertures . indeed ,",
    "if the apodisation function is written as the product of two separable , one - dimensional functions , @xcite , very deep contrast can be achieved on the four diagonal directions of the point spread function ( psf ) with only mildly deformed piaa mirrors .",
    "this configuration implies that if the telescope aperture is circular , the square sub - aperture needs to be inscribed in the telescope pupil , leading therefore to a throughput loss of a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "since any exo - planet dedicated coronagraph will have to be equipped with two sequential dms to reduce the stellar halo due to imperfection in the optics at mid - spatial frequencies ( @xcite ) , and since current state of the art piezo - electric or mems ( microelectromechanical systems ) devices all have a square formats ( @xcite , @xcite ) , it is sensible to study square apertures inscribed in a circular telescope aperture .",
    "alternatively , one could envision a design for which the circular pupil is inscribed in a square deformable mirror .",
    "this would increase the net throughput of the system , and the inner working angle ( iwa ) would become constant for all azimuthal angles of the psf .",
    "however , the outer working angle ( owa ) would not take advantage of all the actuators on the deformable mirror in the diagonal direction and the piaa deformations would become larger .",
    "adressing such a paradigm is beyond the scope of this paper , and we focus in this communication on the case where the square pupil is inscribed in the circular aperture , the case that is widely implemented in current high contrast testbeds ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we begin by reviewing the general derivation of the defining piaa equations and show how to solve these equations in the simplified case of square separable apertures .",
    "we present the instrument response in that case , and study the performance of this pure piaa systems under the ray optics approximation . in a second section",
    "we revisit the analysis considering edge diffraction effects and provide a general expression for the field after a full propagation through any arbitrary piaa coronagraph . in the remainder of the paper we apply these general results to the design and trade - offs associated with piaa coronagraphs over square separable apertures .",
    "we present numerical results that use our new diffractive approximation and illustrate how a combination of pre- and post - apodisers restores contrast below @xmath0 even in the presence of diffractive effects . finally , using the result of this theoretical study , we present novel piaa designs over square apertures which can potentially relax the constraints on the manufacturing of piaa optics or completely circumvent manufacturing by inducing the apodisation with two square deformable mirrors ( dm ) .",
    "the phase induced amplitude apodization ( piaa ) coronagraph was fist introduced by as an optical apparatus composed of two reflective surfaces that remapped the distribution of the light in the pupil of a telescope into an apodisation function which yields a high contrast psf . showed that the mirror surfaces could be derived as the solution of a single differential equation and @xcite subsequently developed this result showing that the relationship between prescribed apodisation and mirrors surfaces could also be written as a set of two coupled partial differential equations .",
    "here we rederive these ray - optics based design equations for arbitrary geometries and illustrate how to solve them using square apertures .",
    "consider the arrangement and coordinate systems shown in fig .",
    "[ figsetuppiaa ] .",
    "note that in this paper we only consider the on - axis pupil - to - pupil configurations leaving aside the off - axis focal - to - focal case , whose surfaces can not be derived by direct integration of the systems of partial differential equations . for",
    "now we do not assume anything about the geometry of the two remapping mirrors : @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two domains of @xmath6 of arbitrary shapes .",
    "we introduce the independent variables @xmath7 that span the domain of @xmath4 and @xmath8 that span the domain of m2 .",
    "the height of m1 is thus given by the function @xmath9 and the height of m2 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "given the distance between the two mirrors , @xmath11 , the optical path length , @xmath12 , between any two points @xmath7 and @xmath8 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the free space propagation within the apparatus @xmath15    following a two - dimensional generalization of the approach in @xcite , the pupil mapping solution for the mirror heights is a one - to - one mapping between points in the domain of m1 to points in the domain of m2 . for instance , if we consider the coordinates @xmath7 on m1 as independent variables , then the pupil mapping solution maps rays to specific points @xmath16 via two functions @xmath17 alternatively , since the pupil mapping solution must be reversible , we can consider the points @xmath8 as independent variables and find the inverse mapping , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the inverse functions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "typically we design the pupil mapping system by selecting the inverse functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 since our goal is a specific amplitude profile at m2 .",
    "we design a pupil remapping unit via ray optics by choosing the heights of each mirror , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that the output amplitude profile follows the desired apodisation @xmath25 .",
    "this requires that the following three constraints be satisfied :    1 .",
    "[ energy_conservation ] the intensity profile after @xmath5 matches the square of the desired apodisation @xmath26 .",
    "the relationship between this profile and the mirror surfaces has to satisfy local energy conservation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "[ constant_phase ] when the apparatus is illuminated by uniform on - axis light , the outgoing wavefront is flat .",
    "this means that , in the absence of diffractive effects , the phase at @xmath5 is constant when the wavefront hitting @xmath4 is flat .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we show how , for any arbitrary geometry , these constraints translate into formal conditions on the heights of each mirror under a ray optics approximation .",
    "the set of equations obtained defines the design of a piaa unit .",
    "+      constraint  [ energy_conservation ] is simply a statement of energy conservation .",
    "this translates directly into an equation for the remapping functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( or , equivalently , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "[ figenergyremapp ] illustrates that the energy in a small square surface element of @xmath4 must equal the energy in its remapped image at @xmath5 .",
    "because of the aspherical nature of the piaa mirrors the area of the each element varies as a function of location at @xmath5 and thus , in order to conserve energy , the light intensity in each square changes accordingly .",
    "more formally , this implies that the energy contained in a differential area @xmath28 at @xmath4 must remain constant when traveling through the set of aspherical piaa optics . considering @xmath29 ) as independent variables , we can view the inverse mapping as a coordinate transformation , given by eqs .",
    "[ eq : g1 ] and [ eq : g2 ] , allowing us to use the differential area formula , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the jacobian matrix of the change of coordinates @xmath8 to @xmath27 .",

    "[ eq : g1 ] and [ eq : g2 ] .",
    "the desired apodisation thus does not directly lead to the mirror surface heights but only to the location of the incident rays .",
    "this implies , as we will study in the next section , that the output field strongly depends on how well the ray optics approximation holds .",
    "[ eqremap ] is a two - dimensional version of the well known non - linear partial differential equation known as the monge - ampere equation , @xcite . while there is no known general solution to this equation for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "we show that , by using a square aperture we can find solutions if we restrict the apodisation to be the tensor product of two one - dimensional functions .      to find the heights of m1 and m2 we follow the approach in @xcite and satisfy fermat s principle ( constraint [ fermat ] ) by minimizing the optical path length of each ray from @xmath27 to @xmath16 .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations this provides the equation governing the height of @xmath4 at each @xmath7 across the mirror , @xmath33 for the height of m2 we use constraint [ constant_phase ] , which states that the phase of the wavefront be constant across the exit pupil .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this translates into the condition that each ray between the pupil remapped points @xmath27 and @xmath16 must have constant optical path length . from eq .",
    "[ defopl ] this means that @xmath34 taking the partial derivative of the optical path length with respect to @xmath8 and setting it equal to zero leads to expressions for the height of m2 , @xmath35 the resulting set of partial differential equations defining a pupil mapping system thus reduces to : @xmath36 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the inverse functions associated with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "variations of these equations were first derived by @xcite for circular geometries using ray optics .",

    "while it is possible to design pupil remappers with two mirrors of different areas , we will restrict our study here to area preserving systems , meaning the set @xmath37 of @xmath7 over the entrance pupil is the same as the set of @xmath8 over the exit pupils .",

    "this conservation of optical path reduces the problem to solving only one second order partial differential equation ( by solving eq .",

    "this finishes our derivation of the design equations of piaa systems using ray optics .",
    "we now focus on applying them to the case of separable apodization functions on square apertures .",

    "@xcite restricted themselves to a circular geometry , which matches a typical telescope entrance pupil .",
    "the resulting azimuthal symmetry reduces the pupil mapping equations to one - dimensional partial differential equation s in radius , leading to relatively simple solutions for the mirror profiles .",
    "we consider here the case of a square aperture inscribed in the circular telescope pupil . to make the design tractable on square pupils",
    "we further reduce the problem by forcing a separability condition on the prescribed apodisation , @xmath39 under this constraint , there are multiple solutions of eqs .",

    "the idea of using square apertures and taking advantage of the higher contrast on the diagonal of the psf was first introduced by @xcite , who used sonine and cosine apodisations .",
    "this idea was re - visited by who introduced an interferometric induced apodisation",
    ". they also pointed towards using optimal functions for square apertures , called prolate functions ( ) . here we use a combination of a horizontal and vertical cross prolate apodizer .",
    "each apodizing screen yields a @xmath47 contrast , resulting in a constrast on the diagonal of the psf of @xmath0 .",
    "note that this is also the underlying idea behind the design of checkerboard shaped pupils ( @xcite ) .",

    "[ psf1dnoapod ] .",
    "note that the deformations along the axes of the square apertures are smaller magnitude than in the azimuthally symmetric case , which seems natural since separable square apertures do not present a full @xmath48 degrees search space .",
    "+      except for the throughput loss associated with inscribing the pupil in a square , a square pupil mapper has all of the advantages of classical piaa coronagraphs . when designed using only ray optics it achieves the needed contrast with nearly @xmath49 percent throughput .",
    "moreover , because of the unique combination of the close inner working angle of square designs and the magnification effects of a pupil mapper system , described in appendix a , it has a very small inner working angle , as close as @xmath50 .",
    "this magnification is due to the dependence of optical path length on the angle of incidence .",
    "our pupil mapping design achieves a contrast of @xmath0 with an inner working angle ( iwa ) of @xmath51 .",
    "however , like other square pupil apodisations , this is not achieved everywhere but only in the region around the diagonals covering roughly @xmath52 percent of the image plane .",

    "contrast is limited by light diffracted off the edges of @xmath4 . under narrow band illumination",
    "the @xmath0 contrast can be retrieved using a deformable mirror based wavefront controller that treats the electrical field oscillations due to the propagated edges of @xmath4 as any other chromatic wavefront error .",
    "however , because the magnitude of such oscillations varies rapidly and periodically with wavelength , it is fundamentally difficult for wavefront control technologies to correct them down to high contrast levels , eg @xmath0 , over a broad spectral bandwidth , @xmath53 .",
    "here we choose to explore a solution , based on apodizing screens , which yields high contrast over a broadband but at a cost in throughput .",
    "such designs are intrinsically achromatic and transfers the problem of bandwidth to the control of wavelength dependent optical aberration , @xcite . in the next section we present an analytical treatment of the edge - diffraction properties of piaa designs .",
    "the previous section derived the pupil remapping equations using only ray optics .",
    "as we noted earlier , it has already been shown for circular geometries ( @xcite ) that when a careful diffraction analysis is carried out , the contrast yielded by a pupil mapping system is degraded by many orders of magnitude . in this section",
    "we present a new approximation to the diffraction integral on arbitrary geometries and show how it leads to the pupil mapping apodization in the ray optics limit .",
    "this approximation is geometry independent and has multiple applications beyond the scope of this communication . in particular",
    "it has been applied to design robust and efficient numerical propagators of arbitrary electrical fields through piaa coronagraphs , @xcite , a tool that is critical for the design and diagnostic of experimental validations .",

    "the field after m2 is thus mainly described by an integral over the quadratic terms of the taylor expansion of the optical path length across the apparatus .",
    "this brings us to our main theorem :    [ mainpropthorem ] consider an arbitrary pupil remapping system designed such that the geometric piaa equations are satisfied .",

    "first , the scaling @xmath99 of the prescribed piaa apodisation is chosen such that the area within the actual optical train of the coronagraph is conserved : @xmath104 because we seek a continuous curvature for the surface of m1 we also impose the value of the prescribed piaa apodisation for @xmath105 to be such that : @xmath106 since @xmath97 is almost zero near to the edge of the pupil . then , using energy conservation , the strip of width @xmath107 is now remapped at m2 into a strip of width @xmath108 this yields , @xmath109 thus , since @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the thin strip at the edge of @xmath4 is remapped into a thick area at the edges of @xmath5 : @xmath112 .",
    "note that for a given @xmath96 , eq .",
    "[ eq::remapstrip ] corresponds to a one to one mapping between @xmath92 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus we do not loose generality when , for practical reasons , we choose to use @xmath103 as the free design parameter .    in the next section we present several square piaa designs .",
    "to do so we first define the post - apodiser by choosing @xmath103 and @xmath96 and then use eq .",
    "[ eq::remapstrip ] to compute @xmath92 and thus design the pre - apodiser .",
    "we derived here the relationships between @xmath103 and @xmath99 and @xmath92 and @xmath96 under the assumption that the pupil mapping optics conserve the area within the apodization region seen by the coronagraphs .",
    "this implies that the actual physical size of @xmath4 is @xmath113 and only its central portion of width @xmath114 is transmitted to the corononagraph .",
    "one might want to choose a different convention and use @xmath114 as the physical size of @xmath4 and scale all the quantities accordingly . in that case @xmath5 and the transmissive region of the post- apodiser are smaller than @xmath114 .",
    "we summarize both conventions in table [ tab::piaaconv ] . in the present paper we chose to use the convention in the first line of table [ tab::piaaconv ] . finally , we point out that for large pupil sizes , whose edge diffraction effects are relatively small , one can design a piaa unit with @xmath115 without using a pre - apodiser to taper the edges of @xmath4 .",
    "however in an effort to keep the scope of this paper as broad as possible , we present designs that use pre - apodisers .",
    "fig  [ figcartonnrealvalues ] illustrates how the light propagates over a one dimensional aperture for such pre- and post - apodised designs .",

    "the large edge oscillations are now remapped very far from the optical axis and thus have little impact on the contrast . combined with the fact that m2 is only reflective for @xmath122 ,",
    "this effect has a highly beneficial impact on contrast : the edge oscillations are not captured by @xmath5 at a very small cost in throughput .",
    "because of the trigonometric form we chose for the pre - apodiser in this study , predicting the contrast and performances of such piaa designs can be achieved without any numerical integration , using only well established functional evaluations . in figs  [ field1dproppostapodzoom3 cm ] and [ field1dproppostapodzoom9 cm ] we show the field at @xmath5 for pre- and post - apodised square piaa coronagraphs with respective pupil sizes of @xmath123 cm and @xmath124 cm . in both cases ,",
    "the phase oscillations at @xmath5 are small enough so that the psfs exhibit a @xmath0 contrast on the diagonal axis ( bottom panels of figs  [ field1dproppostapodzoom3 cm ] and [ field1dproppostapodzoom9 cm ] ) . for each geometry , that is , each choice of @xmath114 and @xmath125 , there is an entire family of apodising parameters @xmath126 that will yield a @xmath0 contrast .",
    "this parameter space will be explored in a future communication .",
    "[ fig::threemonopsfs ] and table  [ tab::piaaperfs ] illustrate three designs we obtained with pupil sizes @xmath124 , @xmath123 and @xmath127 cm .",
    "the contrasts of these design were found at a single wavelength of @xmath128 nm . to check the broadband performance , we computed the psfs over a @xmath129 nm bandwidth ( a 20@xmath130 band centered on @xmath131=600 nm ) with the same combination of @xmath103 and @xmath96 previously used . for this bandwidth ,",
    "the @xmath0 contrast is conserved , as shown on fig .",
    "[ figpolypsfs9 cm ] . in general , the larger the wavelength considered , the larger the stellar halo is since propagation effects scale with @xmath132 .",
    "a broadband optimization of piaa will be presented in a subsequent communication .",
    "in this section we address some issues regarding the practical implementation of the piaa solutions on square apertures . since most optical manufacturing tools are built in order to accommodate circular apertures , polishing a set of square ground piaa mirrors such as the ones used to generate fig .",
    "[ figpolypsfs9 cm ] , with deformations close to @xmath133 m , is a difficult endeavor .",
    "herein we focus on the feasibility of a piaa design using square optics whose optical surfaces can be actuated with very high precision : deformable mirrors ( dms ) .",
    "most of the current dms envisioned for high contrast imaging applications are square , and are thus perfectly suited to implement the solutions discussed in this paper .",
    "the dm piaa unit presented below was designed under the following constraints :    * the broadband contrast , @xmath91 percent bandwidth , should be below @xmath0 .",
    "* the peak - to - valley deformation should be below @xmath134 m for each dm .",
    "this number was chosen based on the state of the art maximal stroke for mems dms .",
    "* the mirror curvature should be below the maximal curvature obtained by an actuator pushed at maximum stroke . in practice this maximal curvature constraint",
    "is already achieved by the use of a post - apodiser that enables a saturation of the dm induced apodisation .",
    "the size of the active region of the dms is fixed to @xmath127 cm which approximately corresponds to the size of the current large stroke mems dms .",
    "we discuss here designs in agreement with the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig::threemonopsfs ] and the bottom line of table .",
    "[ tab::piaaperfs ] .",
    "the free parameters are the separation @xmath125 between the dms , the profile of the pre- and post - apodisers , and the dm deformation .",
    "we note that the deformation of the mirrors scales as @xmath135 and is a weak function of the choice of pre- and post - apodizers .",
    "namely , for given mirror diameter @xmath114 and mirror separation @xmath125 , and for the functional form of the pre- and post - apodizers in eq .",
    "[ eq::preapod ] and eq .",
    "[ eq::postapod ] , there is a wide range of apodization parameters that will yield deformations below @xmath136 microns .",
    "this means that one can choose a geometry according to the maximal deformation constraint , and then proceed by tuning the apodizers so the broadband contrast constraint is satisfied . thus , our first step is to satisfy the sag constraint by selecting an adequate geometry , @xmath88 m in our case .",
    "we then proceeded by enforcing the contrast constraint using numerical propagators that evaluate the electric field ringing at m2 , which is due to the edge diffraction between m1 and m2 .",
    "the magnitude of this ringing is the feature that limits the broadband contrast of a given piaa unit .",
    "the purpose of the pre- and post - apodizers is to mitigate these chromatic high frequency edge oscillations that are remapped near the center of m2 .",
    "these remapped fresnel rings scale as @xmath137 .",
    "since we chose @xmath137 to be about 0.01 , the apodizers need to be quite strong in order to mitigate for large ringing .",
    "consequently , we chose aggressive apodisers , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which limits our throughput to @xmath140 and increases our inner working angle ( iwa ) to @xmath141 .",
    "the loss in throughput is mostly due to the fact that @xmath142 has to be considerably oversized , and since @xmath143 , the actual angular magnification differs from the one for the ideal ray optics designed system : instead of a value close to 2 , the angular magnification equals 1.4 along the diagonal .",
    "the results are shown fig .",
    "[ figshapesfor1 cm ] . the top of fig .",
    "[ figshapesfor1 cm ] illustrates the deformation of two @xmath127 cm dms separated by @xmath127 m for the apodisers parameters chosen here .",
    "the psf at three wavelengths across the bandwidth in the visible are shown on the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ figshapesfor1 cm ] .",
    "finally we discuss here the practical implementation of the solution proposed in this subsection .",
    "the actual reflective portion of @xmath142 has to be of @xmath144 cm , with a @xmath127 cm inner region that is responsible for the coronagraphic remapping . in that region",
    "the maximal deformation is @xmath134 m , and this region ought to be actuated since it corresponds to the high optical quality part of the beam that will propagate through the coronagraph .",
    "the outer edges also exhibit a @xmath134 m deformation , but with a diverging profile and the optical quality of this part of @xmath142 can be crude since this light will not reach the final science camera .",
    "@xmath145 exhibits as well a maximal deformation of @xmath134 m .",
    "thus we believe that the solution presented here is a viable alternative to current piaa solutions , using soon to be available dm technology .",
    "this result is of critical importance with respect to the feasibility of a piaa coronagraph .",
    "because any space based coronagraph will require two sequential dms for wavefront correction purposes , we are proposing here to accomplish both the coronagraphic suppression and the wavefront correction using the same apparatus .",
    "this not only simplifies the design of the instrument , but also eliminates the difficult problem of polishing static piaa mirrors to sufficient precision . in the design proposed here , since the light remapping surfaces and the actively controllable surfaces are the same , the requirements on the static aberrations ( deformation of these optics without any dm command ) are considerably relaxed compared to the case where the remapping optics and the dm are separate",
    "this paper presents recent advances in our theoretical understanding of the impact on contrast of free - space propagation between the two aspherical mirrors designed to generate a phase induced amplitude apodisation .",
    "our results are two - fold .",
    "first , we introduced a semi - analytical tool to compute the diffraction limited field after piaa coronagraphs of arbitrary geometries .",
    "this methodology has already been applied to a number of numerical and experimental studies pertaining to the manufacturability of such coronagraphs and to their performances in the presence of wavefront errors compensated by deformable mirrors .",
    "we expect this semi - analytical result to be fully integrated in the design of the broadband wavefront control loop in experiments validating the ability of pupil mapping coronagraphs to yield the dynamic range necessary to image exo - earths from space at very close angular separations .",
    "the second conclusion of this paper stems from applying this novel diffractive formalism to design piaa units on square separable apertures . in the case of exo - earth imaging ,",
    "it is sensible to explore such geometries since current experimental efforts to integrate together coronagraphs and wavefront control are based on square deformable mirrors .",
    "we illustrated the performance of several designs over different pupil sizes , and laid down the theoretical foundation for a systematic optimization of such coronagraphs .",
    "finally , we emphasized a class of solutions that is particularly interesting : a piaa unit composed of two deformable mirrors .",
    "indeed , for small pupil sizes , the amplitude remapping necessary to generate an apodisation that produces sufficient contrast for exo - earth imaging can be generated solely with dms .",
    "while the throughput of the designs presented here is reduced to @xmath146 , these solutions considerably simplify manufacturing and wavefront control of starlight suppression systems .",
    "we emphasize that the performances of dm based piaa coronagraphs presented in this communication are illustrative realizations of a vast parameter space .",
    "ongoing theoretical work is being carried out in order to mitigate the loss in performance associated with these solutions .",
    "in particular we are currently investigating optimizations that seek to maximize throughput , and therefore angular resolution , for given levels of contrast and bandwidths .",
    "we follow the presentation of @xcite and define the local angular magnification at @xmath5 as the spatial frequency of a tilted wavefront at @xmath4 , as seen from @xmath5 . assuming that the incoming wavefront is written as : @xmath147 then , because of the pupil remapping",
    ", the first order of the outgoing wavefront will be : @xmath148 we define the local angular magnification as @xmath149 moreover @xmath85 is directly given by the geometrical remapping , @xmath150 resulting in , @xmath151 here we define the overall angular magnification using the barycenter of the psf of an off - axis source .",
    "more realistically it should be defined using the maximum of such a psf , but in practice the two results are very close and the convention chosen in this paper allows us to quickly compute @xmath152",
