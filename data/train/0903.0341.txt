    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent the last evolutionary stage of low- and intermediate - mass ( m @xmath6 8 m@xmath7 ) stars before they enter the white dwarf phase , forming from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars after a short post - agb phase ( bloecker 1995 ) .",
    "both the stellar and circumstellar properties dramatically change during the agb to pn transition ( e.g. , balick & frank 2002 ) .",
    "a precise knowledge of the processes involved in this transition relies in the identification of a large number of these objects in order to establish possible connections and evolutionary paths from the agb to the pn phase .",
    "identification of candidate post - agb stars and pne has been successful using the iras [ 12]@xmath8[25 ] vs. [ 25]@xmath8[60 ] two colour diagram ( preite - martnez 1988 ; garca - lario et al . 1997 ) . in this diagram , these objects are located in a well defined region marked by two lines delimited by [ 12]@xmath8[25 ] @xmath9 0.75 and [ 25]@xmath8[60 ] @xmath6 1.13 ( see garca - lario et al .",

    "however , this region overlaps with those of oh / ir stars , young stellar objects and hii regions .",
    "therefore , the iras two colour diagram does not provide an unambiguous identification of post - agb stars and pne .",
    "recently , we have started a spectroscopic program to establish the true nature of sources classified as possible post - agb stars and pne on the basis of their iras colours .",
    "we have already identified six new post - agb stars , two hii regions , several objects of other different nature ( pereira & miranda 2007 ) , and a new high density young pn , pm1 - 322 , that could host a symbiotic star ( pereira & miranda 2005 ) . as pm1 - 322",
    "is located in a region of the iras two colour diagram that is common to post - agb stars , pne , oh / ir stars and young stellar objects , spectroscopy has been decisive to achieve an unambiguous classification .    in the framework of this spectroscopic program ,",
    "we have also investigated the true nature of pm1 - 242 , pm1 - 318 and pm1 - 333 , three objects classified in simbad as _ possible planetary nebulae _ mainly based in their iras colours .",
    "table1 provides the names , coordinates and iras colours for these three objects .",
    "the three are located in a region of the iras two colour diagram in which pne overlap with objects of different nature . in particular ,",
    "it can not be ruled out the possibility of pm1 - 242 and pm1 - 318 being compact hii regions ( see fig.1 in pereira & miranda 2007 ) .",
    "pm1 - 242 has been detected in the objective - prism survey of h@xmath0 emission objects by robertson & jordan ( 1989 , their object 104 ) .",
    "however , its detection in h@xmath0 does not guarantee a pn nature . for pm1 - 318",
    "there is no additional information available to investigate its true nature .",
    "finally , in the case of pm1 - 333 , radio continuum emission at 1.4 ghz and heii@xmath14686 line emission have been detected from the nebula ( condon et al .",
    "1999 ) , which does favor a pn classification .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed analysis of the spectrum of pm1 - 333 has not been carried out as it is the case of pm1 - 242 and pm1 - 318 for which no spectra are available . in order to establish the nature of these objects ,",
    "spectroscopic observations are a first crucial step",
    ".    the morphology of these three objects has neither been analyzed . in the poss ,",
    "pm1 - 242 appears stellar , pm1 - 318 appears as a very small and tenuous nebulosity , and pm1 - 333 appears as a faint extended nebula . in none of the cases , details",
    "about the internal structure can be recognized in the poss . although morphology can not be used as an indicator of the nature of a nebula , it is true that pne and nebulae around post - agb stars exhibit much more symmetric ( or axisymmetric ) shapes than hii regions ( manchado et al .",
    "1996 ; sahai & trauger 1998 ; sahai et al . 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , many pne present small scale regions of high [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios ( @xmath9 1 ) ( e.g. , balick et al . 1994 ) that can not be attained in young stellar objects and hii regions .",
    "therefore , the presence of bright [ nii ] regions in a nebula can be indicative of a pn nature ( e.g. , miranda et al .",
    "thus images obtained in [ nii ] and h@xmath0 filters may be useful to assess the nature of a nebula .    in this paper , we present intermediate - resolution spectra and narrow - band optical images of pm1 - 242 , pm1 - 318 and pm1 - 333 .",
    "these observations have allowed us to confirm that they are true pne , and to investigate their physical conditions and morphology .",
    "long - slit spectroscopic observations were obtained in 2005 august 3 and 5 using the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) at the 2.2 m telescope on calar alto observatory ( almera , spain ) .",
    "the detector was a site ccd with 2048@xmath102048 pixels .",

    "the spatial scale on the detector is 0.53arcsecpixel@xmath12 .",
    "the slit width was 4@xmath13 and it was oriented north - south and centered in the objects ; in the case of pm1 - 333 , an additional red spectrum was obtained with the slit offset 27@xmath13 toward the west from the nebular center .",
    "the exposure time for both spectral ranges was 1800s in the cases of pm1 - 242 and pm1 - 318 , 2700s for the spectra of the central region of pm1 - 333 , and 3600s for the off - center spectrum of pm1 - 333 .",

    "the data were reduced using standard procedures within the iraf package .",
    "narrow  band direct images of pm1 - 242 , pm1 - 318 and pm1 - 333 were obtained in 2005 august 3 and 2006 june 29 using alfosc at the nordic optical telescope on roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "the detector was an e2v ccd with 2048@xmath102048 pixels and a plate scale of 0.19@xmath13pixel@xmath12 .",

    "the images were reduced following standard procedures within the midas package .",
    "figure1 shows the blue and red spectra of pm1 - 242 , pm1 - 318 and pm1 - 333 .",
    "the spectra of pm1 - 242 and pm1 - 318 in fig.1 have been obtained from the respective long - slit spectra by integrating over the total spatial extent of these two ( relatively small ) objects ( see  3.1 and  3.2 ) . in pm1 - 333 , the spectra in fig.1 correspond to two nebular regions of different emission properties extracted from the long - slit spectrum acquired with the slit going through the nebular center ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "all the spectra in fig.1 are typical of ionized nebulae , showing emission lines of recombination h and he transitions , forbidden lines of various ionization states and weak continuum emission .",
    "table2 presents the undereddened line intensities together with their poissonian errors .",
    "the line intensities have been undereddened using the extinction law of seaton ( 1979 ) and the logarithmic extinction coefficient c@xmath15 ( see table2 ) derived from the observed h@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratio assuming case b recombination ( t@xmath4 = 10@xmath16k , n@xmath4 = 10@xmath16@xmath5 ) for the theoretical balmer line ratio of 2.85 ( brocklehurst 1971 ) .",
    "the line intensities listed in table2 show high heii@xmath14686/h@xmath2 and [ oiii]5007/h@xmath2 line ratios between 0.4  1.1 and 5 15 , respectively .",
    "these high line ratios are not seen in hii regions and young stellar objects .",
    "on the contrary , they are typical of pne",
    ". therefore , the spectra of these three objects strongly point to a pn nature .",
    "accordingly , we apply to these objects the png designation of pne ( acker et al . 1992 ) : png031.1 + 03.7 , png074.5 + 02.3 and png100.4 + 04.6 for pm1 - 242 , pm1 - 318 and pm1 - 333 , respectively ( see table1 ) . in the following",
    ", we will describe the spectra and images of each object in more detail .",
    "figure2 shows the h@xmath0 , [ nii ] and [ oiii ] images of pm1 - 242 .",
    "the object presents an elliptical morphology with the major axis oriented almost along the north - south direction , and a size of @xmath11 8@xmath13@xmath105@xmath13 in [ nii ] and somewhat smaller in h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] .",
    "two bright knots define the minor axis of the ellipse in the h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] images , with point - symmetric arcs emanating from these knots and tracing the ellipse .",
    "the point - symmetric intensity distribution is particularly marked in [ nii ] . at low intensity levels , the h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] images show protrusions along pa @xmath11 50@xmath17230@xmath17 and pa @xmath11 150@xmath17 ( see inset in the h@xmath0 image of fig.2 ) .",
    "in addition , an isolated knot is observed in the three filters at 9.1@xmath13 from the center along pa @xmath11 225@xmath17 .",
    "fig.2 also shows the [ nii]/[oiii ] ratio map of pm1 - 242 constructed in order to analyze the excitation within the object .",
    "the lowest excitation is observed around the polar regions of the ellipse , in particular , in two point - symmetric arcs .",
    "the central region and bright knots along the minor axis show the highest excitation , while the isolated knot outside the main body of the nebula presents intermediate excitation .",
    "the spectrum of pm1 - 242 ( fig.1 ) shows relatively strong heii and [ oiii ] emissions ( heii@xmath14686/h@xmath2 @xmath11 0.43 ; [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath2 @xmath11 15 ) and relatively weak [ nii ] and [ sii ] emissions ( [ nii]@xmath16584/h@xmath0 @xmath11 0.31 ; [ sii]@xmath1@xmath16716,6731/h@xmath0 @xmath11 0.08 ) .",
    "these line intensity ratios indicate a medium - to - high excitation pn .",
    "we note that variations of the line intensity ratios within the nebula should exist as indicated by the [ nii]/[oiii ] ratio map ( fig2 ) .",
    "in particular , the [ nii]@xmath16584/h@xmath0 ratio in the point - symmetric arcs is probably larger than 0.31 . from the [ sii]@xmath16731/@xmath16716 line intensity ratio , we derive an electron density ( n@xmath4 ) of 2300@xmath18660 @xmath5 .",
    "the non detection of the [ oiii]@xmath14363 and [ nii]@xmath15775 emission lines does not allow us to determine the electron temperature ( t@xmath4 ) for these ions . using the [ siii ] auroral and nebular lines detected in the spectrum , we obtain t@xmath4 = 10250@xmath18690k .",
    "chemical abundances in pm1 - 242 have been derived assuming the values of t@xmath4 and n@xmath4 quoted above .",
    "ionic abundances are listed in table3 and have been obtained using the task ionic in the iraf package .",
    "the errors in the ionic abundances account for the uncertainties in the line intensities and in the determination of the physical parameters .",
    "these errors are relatively high , particularly in the case of o@xmath19 ( @xmath3 60% ) .",
    "elemental abundances are listed in table4 and have been obtained using the ionization correction factors ( icf ) of kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) .",
    "table4 also lists elemental abundances in other objects for comparison purposes .",
    "pm1 - 242 presents a high helium abundance ( he / h @xmath11 0.29 ) that is well determined with an error of @xmath3 10% .",
    "this result suggests that pm1 - 242 is a typei pn although the n / o ratio of @xmath11 0.22 is unusually low for a typei pn ( peimbert 1990 ; see table4 ) .",
    "note , however , that the errors in the ionic abundances of o@xmath19 and n@xmath19 ( table3 ) are large , and a n / o ratio of up to @xmath11 0.7 is consistent with the observations , making this value typical of typei pne . a more accurate determination of the n / o ratio in this pn is most needed .",
    "h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] images of pm1 - 318 are shown in figure3 together with an [ oiii]/h@xmath0 image ratio derived to study the excitation within the object .",
    "the [ nii ] image is not shown because of the extreme weakness of the [ nii ] emission ( see below ) .",
    "pm1 - 318 presents the morphology of a circular ring with a diameter of @xmath11 3.5@xmath13 and a thickness of @xmath11 1.5@xmath13 , surrounded by an attached round shell with a diameter of @xmath11 10@xmath13 in [ oiii ] and slightly smaller ( @xmath11 9@xmath13 ) in h@xmath0 .",
    "the ring contains two bright regions separated @xmath11 3.2@xmath13 along pa @xmath11 35@xmath17 .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 image ratio shows that the attached shell presents higher excitation than the inner nebular regions .",
    "the spectrum of pm1 - 318 is characterized by strong high - excitation lines and very faint low - excitation emissions ( fig.1 and table2 ) . in particular , heii emissions are strong ( e.g. , heii@xmath14686/h@xmath2 @xmath11 1.1 ) .",
    "other high - excitation emissions include [ arv ] and [ cliv ] lines .",
    "however , the [ oiii ] emissions are moderate ( [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath2 @xmath11 5.5 ) and the [ oiii]@xmath14363 line is not detected , suggesting relatively large amounts of o@xmath20 in the nebula .",
    "the [ nii ] emissions are very weak ( [ nii]@xmath16584/h@xmath0 @xmath11 0.01 ) and [ sii ] , [ oi ] and [ oii ] emissions are absent .",
    "these results allow us to classify pm1 - 318 as a double shell high - excitation pn .",
    "figure4 shows the h@xmath0 , [ nii ] , [ oiii ] and r images of pm1 - 333 .",
    "the images show an extended nebula that is brighter in the light of [ oiii ] , somewhat fainter in the light of h@xmath0 , and that shows a very different morphology in the light of [ nii ] .",
    "all the images , in particular the r one , show a faint star located close to the geometrical center of the nebula , which may be considered as candidate to the central star of pm1 - 333 . in the following",
    ", we will adopt this star as the origin for radial distances and pas measurements .",
    "we note that pm1 - 333 is projected toward the young open cluster trumpler37 .",
    "this coincidence has allowed us to derive an r magnitude of @xmath11 17.8mag for the candidate central star by comparing it to the star cl trumpler37 kun99 ( kun 1986 ) which is registered in our r image .",
    "the [ oiii ] image shows a nebula of @xmath11 105@xmath13@xmath1050@xmath13 in size elongated along pa @xmath11 80@xmath17 .",
    "the main body of the nebula is almost circular with a size between 46@xmath13 and 50@xmath13 .",
    "no sharp inner or outer edge indicative of a shell structure is observed .",
    "the emission from this region is patchy and particularly bright in two knotty arcuate regions , one extending approximately north - south and one extending almost east - west .",
    "the morphology of the main body in h@xmath0 is similar to that in [ oiii ] , although its extension is slightly smaller . in [ nii ]",
    "only the two arcuate regions can be identified , while the diffuse emission is not detected .",
    "the [ nii ] image also reveals the presence of two knotty low - ionization structures ( lis ) along pa @xmath11 70@xmath17 . the sw lis is brighter than its ne counterpart and it extends closer ( between 24@xmath13 and 37@xmath13 ) to the center of the nebula than the ne lis ( between 34@xmath13 and 43@xmath13 ) .",
    "moreover , the morphology of both lis is very different from each other : the sw lis appears as a knotty filament elongated along pa @xmath11 205@xmath17 , while the ne lis is composed of several individual knots .",
    "these lis are associated to bright h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] extensions protruding from the central region .",
    "it is tempting to state that the [ nii ] bright knots are located at the tip of these high - excitation extensions , but a close inspection reveals that they are rather embedded within the high - excitation extensions .",
    "furthermore , faint [ oiii ] and h@xmath0 emissions are detected beyond these lis , although along pa @xmath11 80@xmath17 , slightly different from the pa @xmath11 70@xmath17 orientation of the lis .",
    "the ionization structure of pm1 - 333 is illustrated in figure5 where we present a colour composite picture constructed with the images in fig.4 .",
    "this colour picture reveals that [ oiii ] dominates in the outer regions of the main body of the nebula while h@xmath0 emission fills the central regions .",
    "moreover , the bright [ nii ] emission of the arcuate structures appears embedded within regions of high excitation .",
    "we also note that some of the knots in the arcuate structures present radial tails that are better seen in the [ nii ] emission ( red in fig.5 ) . in this figure ,",
    "the lis appear embedded within regions of high - excitation .",
    "as already mentioned , spectra of pm1 - 333 were obtained through two different slit positions .",
    "the positions of these slits are overimposed on the r image of the nebula in fig.4 ; a slit goes through the center of the nebula close to , but not including , the candidate central star , and the other slit covers the sw lis . in the latter position",
    ", only a red spectrum was obtained .",
    "we will concentrate firstly on the spectrum of the main nebular body .",
    "the slit going through the center covers the low ionization arcuate structure toward the south , as well as the nebular regions toward the north where no [ nii ] is detected in the images .",
    "consequently , we have extracted from the long - slit spectrum two one - dimensional spectra corresponding to the northern region , called pm1 - 333 ( n ) , and to the southern arcuate structure , called pm1 - 333 ( s ) . the spatial sizes of these regions are 21@xmath13 and 29@xmath13 , respectively . these spectra are shown in fig.1 ( see also table2 ) . in pm1 - 333 ( n ) ,",
    "no low - ionization lines are observed , except for some faint [ nii ] emissions due to contamination from a low - ionization knot .",
    "in contrast , relatively strong [ oi ] , [ oii ] , [ sii ] and [ nii ] emissions are observed in pm1 - 333 ( s ) .",
    "the intensity of the heii lines , relative to h@xmath2 , is higher in pm1 - 333 ( n ) than in pm1 - 333 ( s ) , as it is the case of the high - excitation [ ariv]@xmath14740 line .",
    "hei emissions are observed in pm1 - 333 ( s ) but not in pm1 - 333 ( n ) .",
    "other medium - to - high - excitation lines ( [ oiii ] , [ siii ] , [ neiii ] and [ ariii ] ) are observed in the two regions but their intensity is relatively higher in pm1 - 333 ( s ) than in pm1 - 333 ( n ) . in particular , the [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath2 intensity ratio is high , @xmath11 12 , in pm1 - 333 ( s ) but moderate , @xmath11 6 , in pm1 - 333 ( n ) .",
    "these results point out that the excitation level in pm1 - 333 ( n ) is high enough for o@xmath20 , ne@xmath20 , ar@xmath20 and s@xmath20 to be the prevalent ionization states . in pm1 - 333 ( s ) , the arcuate filament preserves a lower excitation level and , therefore , larger amounts of o@xmath21 , ne@xmath21 , ar@xmath21 and s@xmath21 .",
    "the auroral [ nii]@xmath15755 , [ oiii]@xmath14363 and [ siii]@xmath16312 emission lines detected in pm1 - 333 ( s ) allow us to derive values for the electron temperature : t@xmath4([nii ] ) = 17600@xmath18620k , t@xmath4([oiii ] ) = 15300@xmath18225k and t@xmath4([siii ] ) = 22300@xmath181900k",
    ". a rather low n@xmath4 of 445@xmath1845@xmath5 is derived from the [ sii ] line intensity ratio .",
    "this value corresponds to the electron density of the low ionization arcuate structure , not to the surrounding higher excitation material in which the electron density is probably lower .",
    "chemical abundances for pm1 - 333 ( s ) have been derived using the task ionic in iraf and the icf of kingsburg & barlow ( 1994 ) , assuming n@xmath4 = 445@xmath1845 @xmath5 and t@xmath4 = 15300@xmath18225k .",

    "high - excitation emissions of [ neiii ] and [ ariii ] are also observed in the sw lis with a relative intensity comparable to or higher than those observed in the main nebular body .",

    "pm1 - 242 and pm1 - 318 , evidence for their real nature was lacking . for pm1 - 333 ,",

    "1999 ) but a detailed study of the object was not available .    the spectral properties of pm1 - 242 , pm1 - 318 and pm1 - 333 described in  3 confirm that they are indeed pne .",
    "pm1 - 242 presents both high- and low - ionization line emissions typical of a medium - to - high - excitation pn .",
    "pm1 - 318 exhibits a high - excitation spectrum with strong heii and [ arv ] line emissions and extremely weak or absent low - ionization emissions .",
    "finally , pm1 - 333 presents regions with different excitation : high - excitation in the main nebular body and low - excitation in two polar structures and two arcs embedded in the main nebular body .",
    "pm1 - 242 exhibits an elliptical morphology with two point - symmetric , low ionization [ nii ] enhanced arcs tracing the ellipse .",
    "the physical structure of pm1 - 242 could be an ellipsoid , with the major axis along the north - south direction , containing two bright point - symmetric arcs and a bright , high excitation equatorial region . in this case",
    ", the physical structure of pm1 - 242 would be similar to this of cn3 - 1 as shown by studies of its internal kinematics ( miranda et al .",
    "alternatively , the faint protrusions observed in the h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] images suggest that pm1 - 242 could be a bipolar pn with its bipolar axis along the east - west direction .",
    "the bright ellipse can then be interpreted as a tilted equatorial ring while the faint protrusions ( and the isolated knot ) would trace faint bipolar extensions .",
    "the ring - like structure of pm1 - 242 would be then similar to this of , e.g. , he2 - 428 ( manchado et al . 1996 ) , ic2149 ( vzquez et al . 2002 ) or me1 - 1 ( pereira et al .",
    "these pne present the same basic structure consisiting in a bright equatorial ring accompanied by faint bipolar extensions , the difference among them being the orientation of the ring axis ( or bipolar axis ) with respect to the observer .",
    "a study of the internal kinematics of pm1 - 242 would certainly allow us to determine the real structure of pm1 - 242 .",
    "pm1 - 318 consists of a ring - like inner shell containing two enhanced opposite regions , surrounded by a fainter circular attached shell .",
    "the attached shell presents higher excitation than the inner one .",
    "the morphology of pm1 - 318 is similar to this of , e.g. , ngc6826 , ngc3242 ( balick et al . 1998 ) and m2 - 2 ( manchado et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the circular morphology of the inner shell suggests that pm1 - 318 is a round pn .",
    "nevertheless , it can not be ruled out that the inner shell is elliptical with the major axis tilted with respect to the line of sight .",
    "pm1 - 333 is probably an evolved pn , as strongly pointed out by the data presented in this paper .",
    "the absence of a sharp shell morphology suggests that the fast wind from the central star has ceased and that the nebular material is backfilling the central cavity .",
    "the evolved nature is further confirmed by the high - excitation of the nebula , suggesting a high temperature for the central star , and by the low nebular electron density . in this context , the bright low ionization arcs may represent relics of presumably dense , low ionization structures that were previously present in the nebula .",
    "the arcuate morphology of these low ionization structures suggests that they may have been tracing a ring or filamentary structures as those seen in ngc6543 ( miranda & solf 1992 ; balick & hajian 2004 ) .",
    "the lis present the properties observed in fliers of pne ( balick et al .",
    "the morphological differences between the sw lis and the ne lis compare to these observed in ngc7009 in which the fliers exhibit different morphologies and contain knots oriented at different directions with respect to the central star ( balick et al .",
    "the lis strongly suggest that collimated outflows are present in pm1 - 333 . moreover , the protrusions connecting the lis to the main nebular body point out that the collimated outflows have interacted with nebular material in the main nebular body deforming an original round shell .",
    "an analysis of the internal kinematics of pm1 - 333 would be very valuable in order to study the formation processes of this interesting pn .    although collimated outflows are usually observed in pne ,",
    "there are only a few cases of evolved pne in which these structures have been detected . in this respect , pm1 - 333",
    "can be compared to ngc1360 ( goldman et al .",
    "2004 ) , wray17 - 4 and k1 - 2 ( corradi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these four pne present a patchy main body with no sharp shell morphology , indicative of evolved pne , and collimated structures characterized by enhanced [ nii ] emission .",
    "however , the four cases exhibit noticeable differences .",
    "the main shell is approximately circular in wray17 - 4 and pm1 - 333 and elliptical in ngc1360 and k1 - 2 .",
    "the collimated structures are embedded in the main shell of wray17 - 4 and k1 - 2 , outside the main shell but connected to it in pm1 - 333 , whereas in ngc1360 the collimated structures are outside the main shell but not connected to it .",
    "the orientation of the outflows relative to that of the main shell is also different in each object . in ngc1360",
    ", the outflows are oriented along the major axis of the elliptical shell , in k1 - 2 they are oriented almost perpendicular the main axis of the shell , while in pm1 - 333 and wray17 - 4 no orientation can be established for their circular shells . as for the kinematics ,",
    "the outflows in wray17 - 4 and k1 - 2 seem to share the kinematics of the shell while in ngc1360 they present radial velocities larger than the shell .",
    "these results show that collimated outflows in evolved pne present the same varied phenomenology as those observed in younger pne ( see , e.g. , sahai & trauger 1998 , miranda et al .",
    "1999 , guerrero et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "this variety is probably related to the different physical processes involved in the formation of pne .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for comments that have improved the presentation and discusion of the data .",
