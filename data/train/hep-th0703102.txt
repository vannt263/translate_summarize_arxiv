    "black holes quasinormal modes ( qnms ) have been an intriguing subject of discussions in the past decades @xcite .",
    "the qnm is believed as characteristic sound of black holes , which describes the damped oscillations under perturbations in the surrounding geometry of a black hole with frequencies and damping times of the oscillations entirely fixed by the black hole parameters .",
    "the qnms of black holes have potential astrophysical interest since it could lead to the direct identification of the black hole existence through gravitational wave observation to be realized in the near future@xcite .",
    "despite the astrophysical interest , it has been argued that the black holes qnm could be a testing ground for fundamental physics .",
    "motivated by the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence , the investigation of qnm in anti - de sitter(ads ) spacetimes became appealing in the past several years .",
    "it was argued that the qnms of ads black holes have direct interpretation in term of the dual conformal field theory(cft)@xcite .",
    "attempts of using qnms to investigate the ds / cft correspondence have also been given@xcite .",
    "recently qnms in asymptotically flat spaces have acquired further attention , since the possible connection between the classical vibrations of a black hole spacetime and various quantum aspects was proposed by relating the real part of the qnm frequencies to the barbero - immirzi(bi ) parameter , a factor introduced by hand in order that loop quantum gravity reproduces correctly the black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "the extension has been done in the ds background @xcite , however in the ads black hole spacetime , the direct relation has not been found@xcite .",
    "recently further motivation of studying the qnms has been pointed out in @xcite by arguing that qnms can reflect the black hole phase transition . by calculating the simplest possible qnms of electromagnetic perturbations in the background of the mtz black hole obtained in @xcite ,",
    "it was claimed in @xcite that they found the evidence of the phase transition in the qnms behavior for small topological black holes with scalar hair .",
    "further they claimed that at the critical temperature , the continuously matching of thermodynamical functions leads the phase transition to be of the second order and they gave the order parameter of the phase transition . their result is interesting , since it might be the first phenomenon telling us the existence of the phase transition in black hole physics .",
    "is the obtained signature of phase transition in the qnms of electromagnetic perturbation just an accident ?",
    "does the connection between qnms and phase transition hold for more general field perturbations such as the general scalar and gravitational perturbations ? can the qnms be an effective probe of phase transitions in more general black hole configurations ?",
    "in this paper we are trying to answer these questions .",
    "we will first extend the study in @xcite by investigating the scalar perturbations around the mtz black holes and computing its possible qnms .",
    "mtz black hole is an exact topological black hole solution wearing minimally coupled nontrivial scalar field .",
    "the study of the scalar perturbation in this black hole background is interesting .",
    "numerically we will show that the change of slope of the qnms again appears as we decrease the value of the horizon radius below the critical value as that in the electromagnetic perturbation @xcite which shows the phase transition of a vacuum topological black hole to the mtz black hole with scalar hair . to examine whether the qnm is an effective probe of the phase transition in general configurations",
    ", we will calculate the qnms of scalar perturbation of the ads black holes with ricci flat horizons using ads soliton as the background .",
    "it was found that there is a phase transition analogous to the hawking - page transition for ads black holes @xcite .",
    "we are going to study whether the signature of this phase transition can be reflected in the qnms behavior .",
    "considering the four - dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) and a scalar field described by the action @xmath1}\\ ] ] where the potential is given by @xmath2 , we have the equation of motion of gravitational field @xmath3 and the scalar field satisfying @xmath4 the exact solution of topological black hole with the scalar field can be found with the metric @xcite @xmath5\\ ] ] and the scalar field reads @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the line element of the base manifold @xmath8 , which has negative constant curvature @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath9 stands for the mass of black hole .",
    "the range of @xmath10 is taken as @xmath11 for negative mass and @xmath12 otherwise to avoid the singularities of the curvature and the scalar field , where the conformal factor vanishes .",
    "the even horizon is given by @xmath13    from eq.([e5 ] ) , we can see that the black hole always wears a scalar field for fixed non - zero mass .",
    "when @xmath14 , the metric eq.([e4 ] ) stands for a locally ads spacetime without the scalar field @xmath15",
    "the interesting fact is that the above ads spacetime can also be obtained from a topological black hole without scalar field @xmath16 when the mass @xmath9 goes to zero .",
    "this means that for a given mass , there are two branches of different black hole solutions . by computing and comparing their free energies , martinez et.al .",
    "@xcite suggested that a second order phase transition exists when the temperature ( the even horizon ) crosses a critical value @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "when @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , both of black holes have positive mass .",
    "the black hole will absorb the scalar field dress and turn into the stabler bare one eq.([e8 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , both of black holes have negative mass .",
    "a process of dressing up scalar field will happen for the bare black hole and the mtz black hole has higher stability .",
    "@xcite further studied the behavior of the free energies of both black holes and related it to the order parameter defined by @xmath23    by computing the simplest possible qnms of electromagnetic perturbation in the mtz and tbh backgrounds , koutsoumbas _",
    "@xcite showed that near the critical temperature and for small black holes there is clear evidence in qnms on the second order phase transition between the vacuum topological black hole and the mtz black hole with scalar hair .",
    "it is of interest to generalize their study to qnms of more general fields perturbations , such as the scalar field perturbation . in this subsection",
    "we calculate numerically the qnms of scalar perturbation for both mtz and topological black holes and examine the phase transition footprint",
    ".    since the conformal factor in eq.([e4 ] ) does not play an important role , for the convenience of discussion and calculation , we make a conformal transformation to get rid of this factor and take @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in this frame the field equations are @xcite @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 considering that all physical quantities are calculated in the new frame , the metric and the scalar field of mtz black hole are now @xmath29 and @xmath30 expressing the perturbation of scalar field @xmath31 , we obtain the linear perturbation equation by varying @xmath32 in eq.([e18 ] ) @xmath33.\\ ] ]    when we consider the perturbation of the scalar field @xmath34 , in principle the back - reaction of the metric perturbation will affect the scalar field .",
    "however , the effect of the metric fluctuation on the perturbation of the scalar can be dropped near the critical point @xmath14 . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a simple case where the perturbed metric is still of the form ( [ e20 ] ) and the metric function @xmath35 has a small fluctuation as @xmath36 . then linearizing the equation ( [ e18 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath37.\\ ] ] the last two terms in the left - hand - side of the above equation are contributions from the back - reaction of the metric perturbation . in our study , since our interest is focused on the qnms near the critical point , it is easy to show that the factors of contributions from metric back - reaction tend to zero when @xmath38 at the critical point by using ( 14 ) .",
    "thus the back - reaction due to the metric perturbation can be neglected when we focus on the behavior of the scalar perturbations around the critical point @xmath14 . also near this point , the first and third terms in the right hand side of the equation can be neglected . as a result , near the critical point",
    ", the expression in the square brackets in the right hand side of ( [ e22 ] ) turns to be @xmath39 .",
    "further , let us notice that the scalar field in the frame ( [ e20 ] ) is a conformal scalar .",
    "this might explain that although the two potentials shown in fig .  1 look different , the numerical results of the qnms for two black holes are quite similar ( see fig .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "of course , we may consider a scalar perturbation , which is not related to the scaler field @xmath32 in the black hole solution . in that case , we can obtain similar results for both black holes .    by the variable separation @xmath40 , eq.([e22 ] )",
    "is written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the eigenvalue of the harmonic function @xmath44 on the hyperbolic space @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath45 with @xmath46 , we can rewrite eq.([e23 ] ) into @xmath47 for the topological black hole eq.([e8 ] ) , the scalar perturbation is just described by the klein - gorden equation @xmath48 which , under the variable separation @xmath49 and the transformation @xmath50 with @xmath51 , it can be expressed as @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the metric coefficient @xmath53 .",
    "the behaviors of effective potentials of scalar perturbations in the mtz and topological black holes backgrounds are shown in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "compared with the situation in the topological black hole , the effective potential in the mtz background does not diverge , but converges to a nonzero constant at spatial infinity , due to the compensation of the divergence of the non - zero scalar field in eq.([e23 ] ) . for the convergent potential at spatial infinity , koutsoumbas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite imposed the boundary condition that the wave function of the electromagnetic perturbation vanishes at spatial infinity and employed the numerical method devised by horowitz and hubeny @xcite in the mtz background . in our case",
    ", we can see that the tortoise coordinate @xmath54 tends to a constant for big @xmath10 in the mtz background , which is similar to that of the schwarzschild - ads observed in @xcite .",
    "this leads @xmath55 to be a constant for big @xmath10 , which indicates that there is no flux at spacial infinity . as for @xmath56",
    ", we can obtain the approximate solution @xmath57 after substituting @xmath10 with @xmath58 in eq.([e24 ] ) and taking the leading terms near @xmath59 .",
    "therefore @xmath60 is also a constant at the spacial infinity @xmath61 . in other words ,",
    "the oscillation of the qnms is frozen , hence the wave vanishes at the infinity and this constant can be set zero by the definition of qnm .",
    "this makes us confident to employ the method of horowitz and hubeny to calculate the qnms of the mtz black hole . for the topological black hole case ,",
    "horowitz and hubeny method applies naturally .    in the following",
    "we present our numerical results of qnms for the mtz and topological black holes when their event horizons cross the critical point @xmath62 , e.g. @xmath63 .",
    "our results of are shown in fig.[f2 ] and fig.[f3 ] respectively .",
    "we can see that when @xmath64 , the slope of qnms is positive and the slope tends to minus infinity as we approach @xmath65 . when @xmath66 , the qnms lie on a straight line with negative slope .",
    "the results of the qnms of scalar perturbation present us very similar properties to those in the electromagnetic perturbations @xcite . as argued in the study of the electromagnetic perturbation ,",
    "the change of slope of the qnms in the scalar perturbations as we decrease the value of the horizon radius below a critical value reveals the phase transition of a vacuum topological black hole to the mtz hole with scalar hair .",
    "our result presents a support to @xcite in the study of the phase transition for the four - dimensional topological black holes with scalar hair .",
    "to investigate whether the qnms is an effective tool to disclose phase transition in general black hole configurations , we are going to extend the discussion to phase transitions for flat ads black holes in this section .",
    "thermodynamics of ads black holes with ricci flat horizons using the ads soliton as the thermal background has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was found that there is a phase transition analogous to the hawking - page transition .",
    "we will compute the qnms of the scalar perturbation in the flat ads black hole and ads soliton backgrounds and examine whether the phase transition imprints in the qnms .",
    "the metric of the ads black hole with ricci flat horizon ( flat ads black hole ) is @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 with @xmath25 for simplicity .",
    "@xmath69 is a ricci flat metric and @xmath70 is identified with period @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is the black hole mass parameter .",
    "the horizon is at @xmath73 and the zeros of @xmath74 are given by @xmath75 . by the analytical continuation @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the ads soliton is got @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the function eq.([e28 ] ) with @xmath80 replacing @xmath72 . to meet the requirement of regularity , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 vanishes and @xmath83",
    "is identified with the period @xmath84 .    to calculate the energy and to study their thermodynamics ,",
    "the standard regularization scheme is used@xcite , in which these two solutions are matched at a finite cutoff radius @xmath85 @xmath86 and then the limit @xmath87 is taken after all quantities are calculated . by comparing the energies and the euclidean actions of the two solutions , surya et.al .",
    "@xcite suggested a phase transition for @xmath88 analogous to the hawking - page transition . if @xmath89 , small hot black hole is unstable and decays to small hot soliton , while large cold black hole is stable with @xmath90 . in case of @xmath91 , black hole is in equilibrium with the soliton including cases when they are large and hot , or cold and small .    in order to see the signature of this phase transition in qnms , we study the scalar perturbations in these two solutions with the dimension @xmath92 . by separating variables @xmath93 in the kg equation @xmath94 of the flat ads black hole eq.([e27 ] ) , we have @xmath95 the second term of the square bracket just stands for the free motion in the @xmath96 direction and then its eigenvalue is the kinetic energy @xmath97 with any real number @xmath98 .",

    "the effective potential @xmath108 is shown in fig.[f4 ] which diverges at the spacial infinity . because there only exists the ingoing wave near the horizon , the positive sign in @xmath109 is discarded .    in the case of the ads soliton eq.([e29 ] ) , we follow the similar steps to that of the flat ads black hole with the variable separation @xmath110 in kg equation and obtain @xmath111 as above , the eigenvalues of the second and first terms are @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath100 respectively . hence the radial part of kg equation in the ads soliton background is @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 again , the index @xmath109 in the expansion @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 .",
    "the negative sign is discarded to keep the convergence of the wave near the horizon @xmath119 .",
    "we plot @xmath120 in fig.[f4 ] as the comparison to @xmath108 .",
    "notice that the real index @xmath109 is the main difference from that of the flat ads black hole which indicates there is no wave flux near the boundary @xmath119 . in the far region ,",
    "the ads soliton approaches the ads spacetime and hence no wave can flow to the infinity .",
    "therefore , only normal modes exist similar to the form of stationary waves in the ads soliton background , once some perturbations are excited .",
    "our following numerical calculation proves this effect .",
    "we still employ the method of horowitz and hubney to calculate the numerical qnms of the flat ads black hole and ads soliton .",
    "we do the computation with @xmath121 and @xmath122 in eq.([e34 ] ) and eq.([e36 ] ) , because the free motion in the @xmath96 direction is not of importance and it is better that the wave number @xmath123 of the motion in the @xmath124 @xmath125 direction does not vanish if we consider the more differences between the flat ads black hole and ads soliton in the qnms . during the computation",
    ", we fix the period @xmath126 and vary @xmath127 from 0.1 to 10 representing the cases where @xmath127 is much smaller to much bigger than @xmath128 in order to satisfy the condition of the phase transition .",
