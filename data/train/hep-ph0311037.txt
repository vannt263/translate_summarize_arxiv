    "<S> in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the neutralinos , the spin1/2 majorana superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons , are expected to be among the light supersymmetric particles that can be produced copiously at future high  energy colliders . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the two  body tree  level decays of neutralinos are kinematically allowed in a large region of the mssm parameter space and they can provide us with a powerful probe of the majorana nature and cp properties of the neutralinos through the @xmath0boson polarization measured from @xmath0boson leptonic decays .    </S>",
