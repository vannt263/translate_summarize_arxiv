    "we consider the production of a real photon or of a lepton pair in a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be in equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical framework used in the calculation is that of thermal field theory improved by the hard loop resummation @xcite of braaten and pisarski : in this approach one distinguishes hard momenta , of order @xmath1 , from soft momenta , of order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) coupling constant assumed to be small ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "after resummation of hard thermal loops , one is led to an effective field theory from which observables can be evaluated perturbatively .",
    "the production rates of real or virtual photons have already been evaluated , at the one loop level , in the effective theory @xcite . concerning soft virtual photons",
    ", it was found that the rate of production is considerably modified and enhanced compared to the result of the bare theory . besides the usual quark - antiquark annihilation process",
    ", there appear many production mechanisms , in particular processes where the photon is radiated off a ( hard ) quark in a scattering process where the quark is backward scattered in the plasma via soft quark exchange .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the result obtained in a semi - classical approximation @xcite where the photon is radiated off fast quarks in scattering processes mediated by a gluon exchange : we call such processes bremsstrahlung emission of a photon . in this study",
    "we reconcile the two approaches and show that the bremsstrahlung processes favored by the semi - classical approximation appear at the two - loop level in the effective theory and that , in fact , they contribute at the same order in @xmath2 as the processes in the one - loop effective theory",
    ". such a result should not be a surprise .",
    "consider the case of a soft virtual photon .",
    "the rate of production is related to the imaginary part of the vacuum polarization diagram @xcite . in the one - loop approximation of the effective field theory ,",
    "it involves only effective fermion propagators and effective vertices @xcite . a dominant contribution to the rate",
    "arises when the internal fermion momentum is soft and , therefore , all effective propagators and effective vertices have the same order of magnitude as their bare counterparts . a close examination of the final result shows , however , that it has a logarithmic sensitivity to scales of order @xmath1 ( see section [ bpycomp ] ) : this means that such a diagram also receives a dominant contribution from hard fermion momenta .",
    "when the momentum becomes large , the hard thermal loop ( htl ) corrections to propagators and vertices are suppressed by , at least , a factor @xmath3 with respect to their bare counterparts .",
    "this suppression factor @xmath3 can easily be compensated by the larger phase space available to a hard fermion ( @xmath5 ) compared to soft fermion ( @xmath6 ) , thereby leading to a contribution of the same order of magnitude from the soft region and the hard region of phase - space .",
    "now , when an observable is sensitive to the thermal corrections of hard vertices and propagators , it is obvious that all such corrections should be taken into account for the calculation to be complete . some of these thermal corrections are naturally included in the lowest order of the effective theory via the resummation of hard thermal loops .",
    "but , even if the htl approximation is correct for soft external particles , it does not account for all thermal corrections to hard vertices and hard propagators .",
    "for instance , neglecting the external momenta as one does in the calculation of the hard thermal loops is no longer justified when these momenta are not soft .",
    "besides , equally important may be the contribution arising from soft gluons in the loop giving the htl when the external momenta are hard , due to the bose enhancement of the soft gluon term . within the effective theory ,",
    "both types of additional thermal corrections to a hard propagator or vertex are taken into account by considering a one - loop correction to this propagator or vertex .    in the calculation of the virtual photon production rate in the effective theory",
    ", soft gluon exchange appears in two - loop diagrams .",
    "it will be seen that the bremsstrahlung production mechanism is precisely given by these diagrams when the exchanged gluon is space - like .",
    "the evaluation of these diagrams is discussed below .",
    "these contributions are clearly not included in the effective one - loop diagram .",
    "this is obvious when looking at the corresponding physical processes and it manifests itself in the result by the calculated rate being proportional to the square of the thermal gluon mass @xmath7 , in contrast to the one - loop result where only the thermal quark mass appears @xcite .",
    "another important contribution of the two - loop diagrams is associated with time - like gluon exchanges : physically this represents qcd compton scattering and quark - antiquark annihilation to produce a gluon and a photon . to evaluate this properly requires care since the two - loop diagrams with a hard time - like gluon exchanged are already part of the one - loop diagram with effective propagators and vertices .",
    "taking into account the contribution of the appropriate counterterms in the effective lagrangian will prevent double - counting and allow the correct evaluation of the soft , time - like , gluon contribution .",
    "the case of soft real photon production follows essentially the same pattern , except for the crucial fact that , the external line in the vacuum polarization diagram being massless , collinear divergences appear when evaluating the two - loop diagrams : the quasi - overlap of two such divergences , associated with the fermion propagators , leads to an enhancement factor of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the paradoxical result then follows that the one - loop contribution is relatively suppressed by a factor @xmath9 compared to the two - loop one ! the latter is entirely dominated by the bremsstrahlung process since the kinematical constraints require the gluon to be space like for the enhancement factor to occur .",
    "the compton and annihilation mechanisms are sub - dominant .",
    "the case of a hard real photon , of momentum of @xmath10 , shares features with both cases above .",
    "the one - loop approximation has a logarithmic sensitivity to the hard fermion momentum in the loop @xcite .",
    "the two - loop bremsstrahlung has a @xmath11 collinear enhancement , as in the real soft photon case , which however is compensated by a factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the photon momentum , leaving the bremsstrahlung contribution at the same order in @xmath2 as the one - loop contribution . in the following",
    "we are concerned mainly with the bremsstrahlung part of the two - loop diagrams , and leave the discussion of the compton and annihilation processes and their interplay with the counterterms of the effective theory to future work .",
    "we do not discuss the production of soft real photons since this has already been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "in the next section we derive the general expression for the ( real or virtual ) photon production rate at the two loop level .",
    "then we consider the case of soft virtual photons produced at rest in the plasma and derive the leading behavior analytically .",
    "we compare to the one - loop results and show that the bremsstrahlung contribution is numerically dominant although both contributions are technically of the same order in @xmath3 .",
    "the semi - classical approach is then discussed and it is shown that even though the approximations inherent in the semi - classical approach are not really justified in the case of soft photon production in a quark - gluon plasma , it leads to a result quite comparable to that obtained in thermal field theory . turning to the case of hard real photons",
    ", it is shown that the bremsstrahlung mechanism is of the same order as the already calculated one - loop result .",
    "carrying out a more detailed comparison with the latter approach , it is found that the bremsstrahlung process dominates over the one - loop result for photon momentum of @xmath10 but is relatively suppressed by a logarithmic factor for hard enough photons .",
    "for very hard energies , we find that the photon production is in fact dominated by a new process consisting of a @xmath14 annihilation where the quark or antiquark undergoes a scattering in the medium .",
    "we summarize all the thermal field theory results concerning real and virtual photon production in a concluding section .",
    "the role of counterterms in the application of the effective theory up to two - loops is discussed in a first appendix where the problem is also illustrated in a simple example . in a second appendix ,",
    "the importance of phase space factors in thermal calculations is emphasized and the difference with the zero temperature phase space is made clear .",
    "let us first recall the relationship between the photon production rate and the imaginary part of the retarded polarization tensor of the photon , as given by thermal field theory ( we follow the notations of @xcite ) . for real photons ,",
    "this relation gives the number of photon emitted per unit time and per unit volume of the plasma as @xcite : @xmath15 whereas for the production of a photon of invariant mass @xmath16 decaying into a lepton pair we have : @xmath17 basically , the above two formulae differ only by the allowed phase space for the photon , by an extra qed coupling constant when the photon decays into a lepton pair , and by the propagator of a heavy photon .",
    "it is worth recalling that these relations are valid only at first order in the qed coupling @xmath18 since they do not take into account the possible re - interactions of the photon on its way out of the plasma nor the simultaneous emission of more than one photon .",
    "nevertheless , they are true to all orders in the strong coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "this should not be a serious limitation from a practical point of view since @xmath20 .",
    "let us now examine in which topologies the bremsstrahlung can appear .",
    "it is worth recalling at this point that the retarded imaginary part in eqs .",
    "( [ realphot ] ) and ( [ virtualphot ] ) can be expressed as a sum over possible cuts through the diagram @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to look for diagrams that will give bremsstrahlung processes once cut .",
    "a simple inspection of the processes involved in one - loop contributions ( see @xcite for instance ) shows that bremsstrahlung does not appear at this order . to see bremsstrahlung processes",
    ", one should consider the two - loop contributions of fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] .",
    "the diagrams have been obtained via a strict application of the feynman rules of the effective theory @xcite , giving _ a priori _ effective vertices and propagators and diagrams with counterterms in order to avoid any double counting of thermal corrections already included at the one - loop level via the resummation of hard thermal loops , as outlined in appendix [ app : counterterms ] . to make the connection with previous works @xcite easier , we mention that looking at two loop diagrams in the effective theory is just a more rigorous way of doing what we might call `` calculating one - loop diagrams beyond the htl approximation '' .",
    "our present formulation is indeed more rigorous since it takes care of the counterterms , and also more positive since it does not assume _ a priori _ that one needs to go beyond the effective theory . among all the possible cuts through the diagrams , those that correspond to bremsstrahlung",
    "necessarily cut the gluon propagator .",
    "moreover , if @xmath21 is the gluon 4-momentum , only the landau damping part @xmath22 gives bremsstrahlung , the @xmath23 part rather giving compton effect or @xmath14-like annihilations @xcite .",
    "there is another reason why the region @xmath23 deserves a separate treatment : in the @xmath24 kinematical domain , it is obvious that we can not have contributions coming from the htl counterterms since these counterterms involve only bare gluon propagators that do nt have any imaginary part in the space - like region . on the contrary , in the @xmath23 region , one should pay special attention to the counterterm diagrams in order to avoid any double - counting . indeed ,",
    "when the gluon becomes hard , we have a hard loop that may reproduce what is already included in the one - loop diagram via the effective vertices and propagators .",
    "from now on , we limit ourselves to the region where @xmath24 and only to the true two - loop diagrams , leaving the @xmath23 region and the discussion of counterterms to future work .",
    "moreover , since our main focus is on bremsstrahlung , we must retain from the cut quark propagators only the pole part and reject the landau damping part , which would correspond to a different physical process .",
    "for the same reason , the cut should avoid going through an effective vertex .      in order to obtain a bremsstrahlung contribution of the same order of magnitude as the already calculated one - loop contributions",
    ", we need a hard phase space for the quark circulating in the loop , as explained in appendix [ app : phasespace ] .",
    "we will see later that we have such contributions in the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] .",
    "therefore , at leading order , we can use `` bare '' . ]",
    "vertices and propagators everywhere except for the gluon propagator since the gluon can be soft .",
    "the diagrams we have to consider are therefore the simplified versions of the previous ones represented on fig .  [ fig:2loopsimple ] .    in the same figure , we have depicted the relevant cuts as well as the arrangement of circlings that enables one to calculate the corresponding contribution in the framework of the thermal cutting rules .",
    "we have checked that the two cuts represented form a gauge independent set of terms , to which one should add the symmetric cut for the vertex diagram and a third diagram with the self - energy correction on the upper quark line . since these two other terms give the same contribution as the previous two , we simply take them into account by multiplying the final result by an overall factor of 2 .",
    "a straightforward application of the cutting rules valid for the `` r / a '' formalism , with the notations of @xcite , gives for the vertex correction :    & & ^^ra _ ^(q_o , q)_|_vertex=- im^^ar _ ^(q_o , q)_|_vertex= nc__f2 + & & e^^(q , p+l ,-",

    "in other words , for these factors , the @xmath32 or @xmath33 prescription is irrelevant because the corresponding delta function is incompatible with the other delta functions present and therefore vanishes .",
    "we may notice the similarity between eqs .",
    "( [ cutvertex ] ) and ( [ cutself ] ) .",
    "in particular , the same combination of statistical weights appear in both formulae , while the expressions in the square brackets simply express the cuts on internal lines .",

    "( [ eq : lastform ] ) in appendix [ app : phasespace ] ( to which one should add similar terms to take into account all the processes included in our diagrams ) .",
    "therefore , the `` r / a '' formalism appears just as an efficient method to reorder the factors of the integrand in order to make it more compact and more convenient for the subsequent integrations .",

    "since this identity is not true for the gauge dependent part of the gluon propagator , one should not use these expressions of the traces to check the independence of the rate with respect to the gauge parameter @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , we discarded terms that will be killed later by the delta functions such as the one contained in @xmath38 . since a 4-vector like @xmath39 is not a linear function of the momentum @xmath40 , we used some approximations to simplify the calculations , the effect of which is to neglect only terms that are always subdominant ] ] .",
    "we also notice that the statistical weights and delta functions present in eqs .",
    "( [ cutvertex ] ) and ( [ cutself ] ) are invariant under the change of variables @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , in the remaining factors of the integrand , we are allowed to drop the parts which are antisymmetric under this transformation .",
    "collecting contributions from the two topologies , this symmetrization gives :    & & _ sym-4 , [ eq : tracetotal ]    which will be our starting point in the following sections .",
    "when the 3-momentum @xmath43 of the emitted photon is zero , a lot of simplifications occur .",
    "first of all , since there is one 3-vector less in the problem , we need only one angular variable which simplifies considerably the angular integrations .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , the non vanishing invariant mass of the emitted photon regulates all the potential collinear divergences when @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , one can simply forget about the quark asymptotic thermal mass since the purpose of such a mass is precisely to regularize collinear singularities .",

    "it is worth examining more closely to which physical processes the regions i , ii and iii correspond .",

    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : processes ] .",
    "besides the bremsstrahlung present in regions i and iii , we see a new process in region ii .",
    "this process corresponds to an annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair , one of the particles having previously undergone a scattering in the medium . since the scale for the quark momentum is given by the temperature @xmath67 , and since we are looking here at soft photons , it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : kine ] that processes i and iii have support of order @xmath68 in the @xmath69 plane while process ii has only support of order @xmath70 , the integrand being the same .",
    "therefore , we expect and we have checked that process ii is suppressed by a factor of order @xmath71 compared to bremsstrahlung . as a consequence , bremsstrahlung appears to be the dominant contribution as far as the @xmath24 domain is concerned . in the remaining part of this section , we limit our study to the regions i and iii .",
    "we can obtain a further reduction of the phase space by noticing that regions i and iii give the same contribution since they are equivalent by a change of variables ( indeed , after the symmetrization in eq .",

    "when using effective theories based on the summation of hard thermal loops at higher orders , there is potentially a possibility to have multiple counting of thermal corrections that should be there only once .    as a first illustration of this problem in a trivial context ,",
    "let us use the example of a massless real scalar field with a @xmath247 interaction in @xmath101 dimensions .",
    "the lagrangian of such a model is @xmath248 after the calculation of the one - loop tadpole , one realizes that this diagram  a hard thermal loop in the terminology of @xcite  generates a thermal mass @xmath249 that can be important for the phenomenology of soft modes .",
    "therefore , the idea of the htl resummation is to include this thermal mass in an effective lagrangian @xmath250 which is the lagrangian of a real scalar field of mass @xmath251 .",
    "let us assume now that one uses this effective theory instead of the bare one to calculate the same tadpole diagram",
    ". the result would be @xmath252 and since we start now from a propagator with squared mass @xmath253 , the resummation of the self - energy @xmath254 would lead us to a propagator with a squared mass @xmath255 , approximately twice larger than the correct thermal mass . obviously , the above result arises due to multiple countings of the same thermal correction .",
    "stated differently , this is a consequence of the fact that this effective theory is more than a mere reordering of the perturbative expansion of the bare theory since its lagrangian is different . to solve this problem ,",
    "one must write @xmath256 and treat the counterterm @xmath257 as an interaction term , just like @xmath258 . the effect of this counterterm is of course to subtract at higher order the thermal corrections that had already been included at the tree level via the effective lagrangian , in order to avoid multiple countings .",
    "for instance , in the above example , the correct answer for the tadpole @xmath254 when one takes care of the counterterm is @xmath259 which is a perturbative correction to the thermal mass found at the previous step , as it should be . when this counterterm is taken properly into account ,",
    "the effective theory is nothing more than a reordering of the perturbative expansion , since the overall lagrangian remains unmodified .",
    "this problem also arises in effective gauge theories , where the situation is a bit more complicated since we need there an infinite series  one for each hard thermal loop  of non - local counterterms .",
    "these counterterms are defined to be the opposite of the htl contribution to the corresponding function .",
    "then , to a given diagram obtained in the effective theory , one should add the diagrams obtained by collapsing each loop in turn and replacing it by the corresponding counterterm . in order to be more definite ,",
    "let us consider the example of the two - loop diagram of figure [ fig:2loop]-[b ] . in the figure [ fig : counterterms ]",
    ", we have represented next to the one - loop contribution to the polarization tensor of the photon some of its two - loop corrections .",
    "it should be clear from the figure that when the boldface loop of the second diagram carries a hard momentum , then this loop reproduces the htl part of the effective vertex in the dotted box already included at one - loop , plus new sub - dominant perturbative corrections .",
    "the purpose of the third diagram is precisely to subtract a quantity equal to the htl contribution to this vertex , so that what remains constitutes only new contributions .",
    "the net effect of this procedure is thus to reorder the terms of the perturbative expansion .",
    "let us now explain why , despite their conceptual importance , the counterterms do not contribute in the case of bremsstrahlung . as said in section [ sec : bremss ] , the contributions of bremsstrahlung to photon production come from two - loop diagrams in which the gluon propagator is cut , and where one retains only the landau damping part ( @xmath24 ) of the cut gluon propagator .",
    "technically , the gluon included in the 3-point htl that appears on the third diagram of figure [ fig : counterterms ] is a bare one , and therefore its discontinuity has support totally included in the time - like region . as a consequence , the diagram with counterterms contributes only in the region of phase - space where @xmath260 , and can not contribute to bremsstrahlung .",
    "even if they are not a worry in the case of bremsstrahlung , it was important to discuss the potential effect of counterterms since , having shown that the second diagram gives an important contribution , it is not enough to conclude that the two - loop order is important , as it may be canceled by counterterms .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to emphasize the importance of being in a thermal bath in order to have a hard phase space for the quark loop .",
    "this is indeed crucial in the calculations performed in the previous sections since this feature of the diagrams considered in this paper enables them to be of the same order of magnitude as one - loop diagrams . in order to make the following discussion more intuitive ,",
    "let us first transform the bremsstrahlung photon production rate in a way that separates more clearly the phase space from the amplitude of the process producing the photon .",
    "the tools to do that have already been presented in @xcite ( see the section devoted to the comparison with semi - classical methods ) , so that we only give the result here : 1=to 5 cm      where @xmath261 .",
    "this formula tells us that in order to calculate the contribution of some process to the photon production rate , we just have to integrate the amplitude squared of this process over the phase space of unobserved particles ( here , the incoming and outgoing quarks ) . when doing this integration , the external particles are put on their mass shells , and accompanied by the appropriate statistical weight .",
    "the main advantage of this formula is that it exhibits a clear separation in two factors : the amplitude squared of the process producing the photon , and the phase space of the quarks .",
    "therefore , this formula can be used to separate the estimation of the order of magnitude of the diagram in two steps : the order of magnitude of the amplitude , and the size of the phase space over which it must be integrated .",
    "looking at this formula , it is clear that the effect of the thermal bath appears only in the phase space .",
    "indeed , the amplitude that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lastform ] ) is nothing but a zero temperature one ( it does not contain any statistical weight )",
    ". stated differently , if , instead of looking at photon production by a thermal bath , we were looking at bremsstrahlung photon production in p - p collisions ( _ i.e. _ the two scattering quarks come from protons in colliding beams ) , the statistical factors of incoming quarks would have to be replaced by structure functions of a quark inside a proton , and the statistical weights of outgoing quarks would be replaced by 1 .",
    "this difference is precisely the point which makes the thermal bath dramatically different from the p - p collision .",
    "indeed , in the case of the thermal bath , the statistical functions have a support which is 3-dimensional since the plasma is an isotropic medium .",
    "on the other hand , the structure function of the quark inside protons of the beam is vanishing if the quark has a direction different from that of the beam .",
    "this will make a difference when one performs the integral over the momentum @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , if one has something like @xmath262 in the case of the thermal bath , the integral would be @xmath263 for the case of p - p collisions .",
    "as a consequence , the integral over the quark momentum is more likely to be sensitive to hard momenta in the case of the thermal bath . therefore , even if it is not a rigorous proof , these considerations show why some higher order processes which are not dominant at zero temperature may become dominant in a plasma , due to a bigger size for their phase space .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eq : lastform ] ) may help to understand why two - loop contributions may be as important as one - loop ones .",
    "indeed , it shows that the final order of magnitude of a contribution results from a competition between two effects .",
    "the first one is the order of magnitude of the amplitude , which usually becomes smaller when the number of loops increases since the number of coupling constants increases also .",
    "the second aspect of the problem is the size of the phase space , since it may happen that due to kinematical constraints , the one - loop phase space is much smaller than the two - loop one .",
    "both effects can compensate so that two - loop diagrams contribute also at the dominant level .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the case of photon production by a plasma : the one - loop phase space is soft due to kinematical constraints , while the two - loop thermal phase space can be hard ( as explained above , this is possible because we are in an isotropic medium ) .",
    "therefore , the smallness of the two - loop amplitude is compensated by the size of the two - loop phase space ."
