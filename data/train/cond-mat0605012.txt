    "<S> we discuss the formation of crystalline electron clusters in semiconductor quantum dots and of crystalline patterns of neutral bosons in harmonic traps . in a first example , we use calculations for two electrons in an elliptic quantum dot to show that the electrons can localize and form a molecular dimer . the calculated singlet - triplet splitting ( @xmath0 ) as a function of the magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) agrees with cotunneling measurements with its behavior reflecting the effective dissociation of the dimer for large @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the dot shape and of @xmath2 allows determination of the degree of entanglement . in a second example </S>",
    "<S> , we study strongly repelling neutral bosons in two - dimensional harmonic traps . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field approximation , we show that bosons can localize and form polygonal - ring - like crystalline patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of the crystalline phase saturates in contrast to the gp solution , and its spatial extent becomes smaller than that of the gp condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> explorations of the size - dependent evolution of the properties of materials are at the frontier of modern condensed matter and materials research . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , investigations of clusters containing a finite , well - defined , number of elementary building units ( atoms , molecules , electrons or other elementary constituents ) , allow investigations of the transition from the atomic or molecular regime to the finite nano - aggregate domain , and ultimately of the convergence with increasing size to the condensed phase , extended system , category . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , investigations of clusters provide opportunities for discovery of novel properties and phenomena that are intrinsic properties of finite systems , distinguishing them from bulk materials @xcite .    commonly , studies of materials clusters involve atoms or molecules interacting through electrostatic or electromagnetic potentials , with the heavier nuclei being the `` structural skeleton '' and the much lighter electrons serving as the `` glue '' that binds the atoms together . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we focus on novel , somewhat exotic , types of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss clusters of electrons in man - made ( artificial ) quantum dots ( qds ) created through lithographic and gate - voltage techniques at semiconductor interfaces , and clusters of neutral atoms in traps under conditions that may relate to formation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that these cluster systems reveal interesting emergent physical behavior arising from spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries ; symmetry breaking ( sb ) is defined as a circumstance where a lower energy solution of the schrdinger equation is found that is characterized by a lower symmetry than that of the hamiltonian of the system . </S>",
    "<S> such sb is exhibited through the formation of clusters of _ localized _ electrons ( often called wigner molecules , wms ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) qds ( see fig .  1 and in particular our discussion of two - electron wms below @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry breaking is also manifested in the transition @xcite , induced by increasing the interatomic repulsive interaction strength , of the bec state of neutral atoms confined by a parabolic 2d trap to a crystalline cluster state . </S>",
    "<S> +   +     electrons and @xmath3 , exhibiting breaking of the circular symmetry at @xmath4 and zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> remaining parameters are : parabolic confinement , @xmath5 mev ; effective mass @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> distances are in nanometers and the electron density in @xmath7 nm@xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . , width=245 ]    * two - electron wigner molecules . * </S>",
    "<S> electron localization leading to formation of molecular - like structures [ the aforementioned wigner molecules ] within a _ single circular _ two - dimensional quantum dot at zero magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) has been theoretically predicted to occur @xcite , as the strength of the @xmath9-@xmath9 repulsive interaction relative to the zero - point energy increases , as expressed through an inceasing value of the wigner parameter @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the characteristic harmonic - oscillator length of the confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> ( the subscript @xmath13 in the case of a coulomb force stands for `` wigner '' , since the confined clusters of localized electrons may be viewed as finite - size precursors of the bulk wigner crystal @xcite . ) formation of such `` molecular structures '' is a manifestation of spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with a quantum phase transition , occuring at zero magnetic field for circular 2d qds for @xmath14 and involving the crossover from a liquid - like state to a crystalline one . </S>",
    "<S> this crossover , described using symmetry breaking @xcite , was confirmed in other studies @xcite using a variety of methods . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of electron localization , that underlies the appearance of crystalline patterns , has been described @xcite as a progression from `` weak '' to `` strong '' wigner molecules as a function of increasing @xmath10 ( or equivalently decreasing density ) . in high magnetic fields , the rotating electron molecules exhibit magic angular momenta @xcite corresponding to fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) fillings . </S>",
    "<S> this has led @xcite to the derivation of an analytic trial wave function that provides a better description of the finite - size analogs of the fqhe in comparison with the laughlin @xcite and composite - fermion @xcite wave functions .    because of the finite size </S>",
    "<S> , wigner molecules are expected to show new behavior that differs from the classical wigner crystal familiar from solid state physics . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of a classical wigner crystal is expected to be reached for a higher number of electrons @xmath15 and very large @xmath10 @xcite . in the following we use the term `` wigner molecule '' even in the case of only two localized electrons . for this case </S>",
    "<S> the wm exhibits close analogies to an h@xmath16 natural molecule , as described below .    </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on a two - electron @xmath17 wm , in light of the current experimental effort @xcite aiming at implementation of a spin - based @xcite solid - state quantum logic gate that employs two coupled one - electron qds ( double dot ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present an exact diagonalization ( exd ) and an approximate ( generalized heitler - london , ghl ) microscopic treatment for two electrons in a _ single _ </S>",
    "<S> elliptic qd specified by the parameters of a recently investigated experimental device @xcite . while formation of wigner molecules in circular qds requires weak confinement ( that is small @xmath18 in the expression for @xmath10 given above ) , and thus large dots of lower densities ( so that the interelectron repulsion dominates ) , we show that formation of such wms is markedly enhanced in highly deformed ( e.g. , elliptic ) dots due to their lower symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations provide a good description of the measured @xmath2 curve ( the singlet - triplet splitting ) when screening @xcite due to the metal gates and leads is included ( in addition to the dielectric constant of the semiconductor , gaas ) . in particular , our results reproduce the salient experimental findings pertaining to the vanishing of @xmath2 for a finite value of @xmath19 t [ associated with a change in sign of @xmath2 indicating a singlet - triplet ( st ) transition ] , as well as the flattening of the @xmath2 curve after the st crossing . these properties , and in particular the latter one , are related directly to the formation of an electron molecular dimer and its effective dissociation for large magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the effective dissociation of the electron dimer is most naturally described through the ghl approximation , and it is fully supported by the more accurate , but physically less transparent , exd .    of special interest for quantum computing @xcite is the degree of entanglement exhibited by the two - electron molecule in its singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum state of two or more objects can not be described independently of each other , even when the individual objects are spatially separated . </S>",
    "<S> the highest degree of entanglement occurs at full separation , as discussed in the celebrated epr ( einstein , podolsky , and rosen ) paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electrons confined in a quantum dot are not necessarily spatially separated from each other , and consequently their degree of entanglement may be lower than the maximal one , as shown by us below .    here , in relation to the microscopic calculations , we investigate two different measures of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the first , known as the concurrence ( @xmath20 ) for two _ indistinguishable _ fermions @xcite , has been used in the analysis of the experiment in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( this measure is related to the operational cycle of a two - spin - qubit quantum logic gate @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second measure , referred to as the von neumann entropy ( @xmath21 ) for _ indistinguishable _ particles , has been developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the present _ wave - function - based _ methods , in conjunction with the knowledge of the dot shape and the @xmath2 curve , enable theoretical determination of the degree of entanglement , in particular for the elliptic qd of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in the degree of entanglement ( for both measures ) with stronger magnetic fields correlates with the dissociation of the @xmath22 molecule . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the experimental assertion @xcite that cotunneling spectroscopy can probe properties of the electronic wave function of the qd , and not merely its low - energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our methodology can be straightforwardly applied to other cases of strongly - interacting devices , e.g. , double dots with strong interdot - tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * clusters of neutral bosons in harmonic traps . </S>",
    "<S> * bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in harmonic traps @xcite are normally associated with weakly interacting neutral atoms , and their physics is described adequately by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field theory @xcite . lately , however , experimental advances in controlling the interaction strength @xcite permit the production of novel bosonic states in the regime of strong interparticle repulsions . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical efforts motivated by this capability include studies of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , and investigations about the `` fermionization '' limit of an one - dimensional ( 1d ) gas of trapped impenetrable bosons @xcite , often referred to as the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we address the problem of strongly repelling ( impenetrable ) bosons in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss 2d interacting bosons in a _ circular _ harmonic trap , with the extension to 3d systems being straightforward . to this end , we use computational methods that go beyond the gp method .    </S>",
    "<S> we explore the transition from a bec ( diffuse cloud ) state to a crystalline phase , in which the trapped localized bosons form crystalline patterns . at the mean - field level , these crystallites are static and are portrayed directly in the single - particle densities . </S>",
    "<S> after restoration of rotational symmetry , the single - particle densities are circularly symmetric , and thus the crystalline symmetry becomes `` hidden '' ; however , it can be revealed in the conditional probability distribution ( cpd , anisotropic pair correlation ) , @xmath23 , which expresses the probability of finding a particle at @xmath24 given that the `` observer '' ( i.e. , reference point ) is riding on another particle at @xmath25 @xcite . </S>"
