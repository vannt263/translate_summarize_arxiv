    "we show that , as with real coefficients , it is indeed possible to build very efficient high order splitting methods whose coefficients have positive real part by solving directly the order conditions necessary to achieve a given order @xmath23 . these are , roughly speaking , large systems of polynomial equations in the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 of the method ( [ eq : splittingmethod ] ) , arising by requiring that the formal expansion of the method satisfies ( [ eq : formalle ] ) for arbitrary non - commuting operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "for that reason , and to keep the treatment as simple as possible , we have applied a simple second - order finite difference scheme in space .",

    "we compute the error of the numerical solution at time @xmath228 ( in the @xmath22-norm ) as a function of the number of evaluations of the basic method ( the strang splitting ) and represent the outcome in figure [ fig : reactdiff ] . in the left panel",

    "strang ) of a method composed of @xmath63 steps is approximated by @xmath229 , where the factor @xmath230 stands here for an average ratio between the cost of complex arithmetic compared to real arithmetic .",
    "a remarkable outcome of these experiment is that methods ( p6s7 ) and ( p8s15 ) outperform strang s splitting ( and actually all other methods tested here ) even for low tolerances .",
    "scheme ( p8s15 ) , in particular , proves to be the most efficient in the whole range explored .",

    "we take , in particular , fisher s potential @xmath232 the splitting considered here corresponds to solving , on the one hand , the linear equation with the operator @xmath6 being the laplacian , and on the other hand , the nonlinear ordinary differential equation @xmath233 with initial condition @xmath234 note that it can be solved analytically as @xmath235 which is well defined for small complex time @xmath10 .",
    "we proceed in the same way as for the previous linear case , starting with @xmath217 .",
    "after discretization in space , we arrive at the differential equation @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 is now defined by @xmath239 we choose @xmath227 and compute the error ( in the @xmath22-norm ) at the final time @xmath228 by applying the same composition methods as in the linear case .",
    "the results are collected in figure [ fig : reactdiff-2 ] , where identical notation has been used .",
    "notice that , strictly speaking , the theoretical framework upon which our strategy is based does not cover this nonlinear problem .",
    "nevertheless , the results achieved are largely similar to the linear case .",
    "in particular , the new 8th - order composition method is the most efficient even for moderate tolerances .",
    "splitting methods with real coefficients for the numerical integration of differential equations of order higher than two have necessarily some negative coefficients .",
    "this feature does not suppose any special impediment when the differential equation evolves in a group , but may be unacceptable when it is defined in a semi - group , as is the case with the evolution partial differential equations considered in this paper .",
    "one way to get around this fundamental difficulty is to consider splitting schemes with complex coefficients having positive real part .",
    "this has been recently proposed for diffusion equations in @xcite .",
    "splitting and composition methods with complex coefficients have been considered in different contexts in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "splitting methods up to order 14 with complex coefficients with non - negative real part have been recursively constructed either by the so - called triple - jump compositions or by the quadruple - jump compositions , starting from the symmetric second - order strang splitting . in this work",
    "we prove that there exists indeed an order barrier of 14 for methods constructed in this way .",
    "more generally , we show that no method of order higher than 14 with coefficients having non - negative real part can be constructed by sequential @xmath63-jump compositions starting from a symmetric method of order 2 .",
    "we further show , by explicitly obtaining methods of order 16 ( as the composition of a basic symmetric method of order 8) , that this order barrier does not apply for general composition methods ( non - necessarily constructed by recursive applications of @xmath63-jump compositions ) with complex coefficients with non - negative real part .",
    "in addition to this order barrier , another drawback of methods resulting from applying the @xmath63-jump composition procedure is that for high orders they require a larger number of stages ( i.e. number of compositions of the basic symmetric second order method ) than methods obtained by directly solving the order conditions with the minimal number of stages .",
    "for instance , methods of order 6 ( respectively , 8) obtained with triple jump compositions need 9 ( resp .",
    "27 ) compositions of the basic second order method , whereas , as we show in the present work , methods of order 6 ( resp . 8) can be constructed ( by directly solving for the required order conditions ) with 7 ( resp .",
    "15 ) stages .",
    "an analysis of the local error coefficients supported by numerical tests shows that the methods proposed here are more efficient than those obtained in  @xcite by applying the recursive triple jump and quadruple jump constructions .",
    "an additional requirement when choosing a given method is that the arguments of the complex coefficients of the scheme have also to be taken into account .",
    "this constitutes a critical point for evolution equations where one of the operators ( say , @xmath6 ) has non - real eigenvalues in the right - hand side of the complex plane , as occurs , in particular , with the complex ginzburg  landau equation ( [ eq : landau ] ) .",
    "in such a case , splitting methods of the form ( [ eq : splittingmethod ] ) where one of the two sets of coefficients @xmath38 s or @xmath39 s is entirely contained in the positive real axis , whereas the other set is included in the right - hand side of the complex planes are particularly well suited .",
    "such splitting methods can not be constructed as composition methods with the strang splitting as basic method , so that a separate study is required to get the most efficient schemes within this class .",
    "based on the theoretical framework worked out in @xcite , the integrators proposed here can be applied to the numerical integration of linear evolution equations involving unbounded operators in an infinite dimensional space , like linear diffusion equations . as a matter of fact , although the theory developed in @xcite does not cover the generalization to semi - linear evolution equations , we have also included in our numerical tests a system of odes obtained from semi - linear evolution equations with a certain space discretization .",
    "all the numerical tests carried out with periodic boundary conditions show a considerable improvement in efficiency of our new methods with respect to existing splitting schemes .",
    "a remarkable feature of the new eighth - order composition method when applied to both the linear and semi - linear diffusion examples is that it is more efficient than all the other integrators of order @xmath240 in the whole range of tolerances explored when periodic boundary conditions are considered .",
    "concerning other ( e.g. dirichlet and neumann ) boundary conditions , the experiments carried out in @xcite for linear problems with methods obtained by applying the triple and quadruple jump technique show the existence of an order reduction phenomenon .",
    "its origin is attributed by the authors of @xcite to the fact that condition 2 in the introduction is not generally satisfied in this setting . in other words , terms of the form @xmath241 in ( [ eq : formalle ] )",
    "are not uniformly bounded on the interval @xmath242 $ ] for some @xmath243 .",
    "as a consequence , the classical convergence order is no longer guaranteed in that case .",
    "this order reduction is also present , of course , when the methods introduced in this paper are applied to linear but also semi - linear problems . nevertheless ,",
    "as has been pointed out in @xcite , splitting schemes of high order involving complex coefficients may still be advantageous in comparison with , say , strang splitting when applied to linear parabolic problems with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , as they often lead to smaller errors and the order reduction is somehow confined to a neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "the situation , in our opinion , calls for a detailed study of the effect of boundary conditions other than the periodic case in the global efficiency of splitting methods with complex coefficients and the analysis of their applicability for more general parabolic problems than those considered in this paper .",
