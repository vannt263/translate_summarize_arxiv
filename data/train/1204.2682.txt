    "over a half century , the critical state model@xcite ( csm ) has been an essential interpretative tool for the investigation of the macroscopic magnetic properties of type - ii superconductors .",
    "this accomplishment probably relies on a clear physical background together with an ostensible mathematical simplicity , that have enabled a huge number of utilizations both in material characterization as well as in more fundamental studies .    in brief",
    ", the csm postulates that the biased magnetic response of a type - ii superconductor is defined in terms of a series of metastable equilibrium configurations , each characterized by a current density distribution @xmath0 . in the simplest cases ,",
    "@xmath0 may be obtained by integration of ampre s law given by @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 , the so - called critical current density is the single material parameter of the theory , and characterizes the balance equation between magnetic and intrinsic pinning forces : @xmath3 .",
    "the transition between different configurations is assumed to take place instantaneously , which means that external field variations occur slowly enough as compared to the scale established by the material response ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , although it is well known that magnetic flux penetration in the presence of pinning forces happens as an _ avalanching process_@xcite when the threshold condition is exceeded ( i.e. : @xmath5 ) , one argues that magnetic diffusion is so fast that the superconductor settles a negligible time in the intermediate resistive states .    in many instances ,",
    "the csm approximation is justified , but especially for the case of high @xmath6 superconductors one can meet practical situations for which relaxation transients towards equilibrium configurations have to be considered .",
    "a very relevant case is the _ fault current limiter _ that , by construction operates driving the superconductor beyond the resistive transition@xcite .",
    "the precise knowledge of the magnetic diffusion processes that occur is obviously necessary for the design of such devices .",
    "in particular , the essential evaluation of energy losses may be seriously tampered if one neglects the effect of the sample becoming resistive .",
    "on the other hand , and more to the side of basic physics , one has to recall that , experimentally , the value of the critical parameter @xmath2 is often obtained from transport measurements that are based on some threshold value for the voltage detected when the sample goes resistive ( typically @xmath7 ) . in a recent work about the origin of the dissipation mechanisms that operate for superconductors in the vortex state , it has been argued that , although designed for obtaining the critical parameters , resistive measurements could be ineluctably recording properties of the resistive state@xcite .",
    "this circumstance is relevant for hts samples that display more gradual current voltage transitions as compared to the sharp behavior for conventional superconductors .",
    "finally , it should also be mentioned that from the fundamental point of view , embedding the csm approximation in a time dependent theory that allows to derive it as a limiting case is by itself a desirable objective .    in this work we put forward a minimal formulation that upgrades the critical state theory so as to enable the inclusion of _ overcritical behavior_. the basic picture of our statement is as follows .",
    "subject to an external action , the state of the superconductor will drift until new steady conditions are met .",
    "if allowed , the steady state will be an equilibrium phase , characterized by a conventional _ force balance _ equation , with critical behavior for the current density .",
    "on the other hand , dissipative _ steady states _ and excursions from one critical state to the other will be described under a first order ( linear ) approximation for the underlying driving forces . following the spirit of bean s model , although describing phenomena whose ultimate nature would at least require a mesoscopic scale , we pursue a theory based on macroscopic variables .",
    "thus , our basic assumption is that the superconductor behaves as a thermodynamic system , with the coarse - grained current density as the state variable , and postulate that dynamic properties may be predicted on the basis of three factors :    * magnetic forces * material pinning forces * irreversible thermal forces .",
    "the latter group will allow to introduce the physical effects related to dissipation induced by overcritical current flow . in order to avoid microscopical modeling",
    ", a power series expansion argumentation will be used for introducing such effects .",
    "outstandingly , recalling universal properties as entropy increase and single valuedness of the physical observables , one can fairly determine the kind of models to be used , even in complex scenarios such as flux cutting environments or 3d modeling .",
    "it must be clarified that , being interested in the description of small excursions beyond the critical state , long term effects , such as thermal relaxation to true equilibrium are not considered here .",
    "thus , our theory describes the behavior of superconducting material with a characteristic a time very short as compared to thermal creep relaxation , but non negligible against external source variations , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , magnetic diffusion times are small but not negligible against external sources variations , while thermal creep ( of the order of hours or days ) is ignored , determining a well defined metastable equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , isothermal conditions will be assumed and , thus , any energy transfer from the electromagnetic sector would be immediately absorbed by the surrounding thermal bath .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_2 ] is devoted to deliver the formal details of our theory .",
    "first ( sec.[sec_21 ] ) we recall some mechanical concepts ( fields , forces , drude s model ) that allow a rudimentary approach to the problem of dissipation in normal conducting systems .",
    "then , ( sec.[sec_22 ] ) some basic thermodynamic background is introduced , with the aim of paving the way for the generalization to superconductors . as a central result of our work , in [ sec_222 ]",
    "we introduce the idea of _ dissipation function _ and entropy generation for type - ii superconductors driven out of equilibrium .",
    "we will show that , concomitant with a complex structure for the metastable equilibrium states , an acceptable theory of resistive losses has to fulfill some consistency requirements , that will be used to put restrictions on the possible material laws to be used ( @xmath9 in particular ) . in order to ease the practical implementation , a variational form of our theory",
    "is issued .",
    "the second part of our paper ( sec.[sec_3 ] ) illustrates the application of the above concepts to practical situations .",
    "mainly focused on the infinite strip geometry ( quasi-1d configuration ) , we show that our basic equation allows to obtain the electromagnetic quantities either in equilibrium , steady states or during transient processes .",
    "it is explicitly shown that , for a given set of external conditions , relaxation eventually leads to the well known corresponding critical states .",
    "excellent comparison with analytical results , when available , is displayed .",
    "the final section ( sec.[sec_4 ] ) summarizes our results and contains a brief discussion of possible applications and extensions of our work in the area of type - ii superconductivity .",
    "[ sec_2 ]      [ sec_21 ]    let us start by recalling some details about the classical description of electrical conduction in normal metals , _ viz .",
    "_ , the drude model . as we will see , this simple scheme may be illuminating for the issue of a minimal model of the resistive behavior of hard superconductors .",
    "[ sec_211 ]    the simplest description of electric current in normal conductors ( drude model ) is built from the classical dynamical equation of the charge carriers subject to both an external electric field and a phenomenological drag force @xmath11 standing for the interaction with the molecular environment and other charges , i.e. :    @xmath12    customarily , @xmath11 is taken to first order , i.e. : @xmath13 and it is a characteristic of the material through the time constant @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to recall that all the quantities in the above formulae have to be interpreted as mesoscopic averages both in spatial regions and time intervals .",
    "this entails smoothing ( by randomizing ) the macroscopically irrelevant fluctuations of the microscopic level . in a thermodynamic language",
    ", one speaks about a thermalized electron - lattice system . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the model catches the basic behavior observed in an overwhelming amount of experiments .",
    "it is of particular interest to observe that , unless for very high excitation frequencies ( in the range of 1 thz for typical metals ) , further simplification is possible .",
    "first , a quasisteady state approximation may be used , that implies to neglect the time derivative ( electron inertia ) to the left hand side of eq.([eq_drude ] ) .",
    "then , the non - dispersive form of ohm s law arises , i.e. : @xmath15 with @xmath16 the number of conduction electrons per unit volume . also , related to the use of good conductors , as it is customary in conventional electric machines , charge accumulation within the sample",
    "may be neglected ( i.e. : @xmath17 ) and one may use ampre s law in its _ magnetoquasistatic _",
    "form @xmath18 .",
    "in practice , when studying the evolution induced by some process of the external excitation , this means that one starts by calculating the _ dominant _ magnetic fields from the diffusion equation , that for latter convenience will be expressed in terms of the material resistivity @xmath19 @xmath20 eventually , * e * is obtained from faraday s law . notice that _ stationary _ solutions of this equation verify the condition @xmath21 , that is to say : persistent current loops within the sample are excluded for a normal metal .",
    "[ sec_212 ]    microscopically , the nature of resistive losses in flux penetrated type - ii superconductors is quite more complex than the scattering of normal electrons , which is behind the above summarized drude s model .",
    "nevertheless , one can take benefit of the conceptual aspects introduced , that may be straightforwardly applied at the phenomenological level .",
    "thus , it is well known that under the action of a transport current and a perpendicular magnetic field , these materials experience a resistive transition , also characterized by a linear @xmath9 relation , now in terms of the so - called flux - flow resistivity @xmath22 .",
    "this behavior is well understood at the mesoscopic level .",
    "abrikosov vortices are driven by the lorentz - like force @xmath23 and their normal cores contribute to the transport current as a normal channel .",
    "then , in the absence of additional effects , one could formulate the behavior of the superconductor in the same terms described above for a normal metal , just replacing @xmath24 by @xmath22 .",
    "however , the detrimental flux flow behavior has been customarily attacked by a number of pinning strategies . basically , they rely on the idea of introducing a _ restoring _ force on the vortices , so as to keep them in equilibrium positions while a transport current flows along the system ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "as pinning forces are bounded ( @xmath25 ) , there will be a threshold value for the current density that can flow lossless , the so - called _ critical current density _ @xmath2 .",
    "as it was said before , in this framework , the calculations leading to the evaluation of magnetostatic equilibrium properties may be rather simple .",
    "thus , bean s postulate states that _ flux penetrated regions will be characterized by the threshold ( critical ) conditions _ ,",
    "i.e. : @xmath26 . following this , in 1d problems",
    "one just has to integrate ampre s law in the form @xmath27 supplied by specific boundary conditions for the magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , the investigation of the transient processes involving the appearance of resistivity may be quite complex , even for the simplest geometries .",
    "the reason is that now , effective _ drag forces _ only occur for currents circulating with a density beyond the critical value @xmath2 . in other words",
    ", one has to deal with a material law of the kind @xmath28 where @xmath29 as a consequence of the non - linearity introduced by the piece - wise constant behavior of @xmath30 , one has to deal with noticeable difficulties , as for instance , the form taken by the diffusion equation ( compare to eq.([eq_diff ] ) )    @xmath31    difficulties for solving this equation by analytical methods have been reported in refs.(@xcite ) that basically suggest to apply _ ad hoc _ approximations when justified by the set of experimental data under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "we stress that , in fact , the limiting bean s approximation means to avoid such equation under the following thoughts .",
    "if the actual material law in eq.([eq_rff ] ) is such that one can speak about a sharp transition , i.e. : @xmath22 takes elevated values as compared to the experimental parameter @xmath32 , one can approximate @xmath33 .",
    "then , the magnetic diffusion time ( @xmath34 ) may be neglected and externally induced evolutions may be accurately described as a series of equilibrium _",
    "critical _ states .",
    "fig.[fig_1 ] displays the main features of the above mentioned modeling with a finite value of @xmath22 for the case of 1d systems .",
    "let us analyze the physical significance of such a material law .",
    "* note first that superconducting lossless transport is allowed by the condition @xmath35 within the region @xmath36 $ ]",
    ". the superconducting range @xmath37 increases with the value of @xmath2 , starting from @xmath38 in very low pinning materials , that behave like `` normal conductors '' ( see arrows in fig.[fig_1 ] ) . *",
    "persistent shielding is also possible , subsequent to electromagnetic induction because @xmath39 can go to zero and @xmath40 take a local structure that allows @xmath41 when diffusion stops . in particular , this includes the critical state solutions with @xmath40 taking the values @xmath42 or @xmath38 within the sample , and forming screening loops .",
    "* one can visualize bean s model as a limiting case of this material law when there is an arbitrarily high slope of @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "* the conceptual implications of fig.[fig_1 ] may be straightforwardly generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 may be a region of the @xmath45-space and @xmath46 its boundary .",
    "thus , for the case of high  t@xmath47 superconductors it has been recently shown @xcite that a meaningful selection would be to take @xmath37 as an elliptic region , within the plane defined by the components of @xmath45 parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "other possible regions , related to specific materials , will be commented on .",
    "* the material law for a type - ii superconductor depends not only on the intrinsic parameter @xmath22 , but is strongly affected by extrinsic quantities .",
    "in particular , the ambient magnetic field will play a prominent role for the definition of the region @xmath37 .",
    "thus , already in the simple 1d cases , the dependence @xmath48 is usually an important concern . on the other hand , as mentioned above , the relative orientation of the vectors @xmath45 and @xmath49 is crucial for the material law in higher dimensions .    performing calculations within the above described material law and its _ natural _ extensions to 3d is by no means a simple task .",
    "below , we suggest a first approximation to the problem that relies on thermodynamic concepts applied either close to equilibrium or close to steady states .",
    "this will provide a useful framework for developing numerical tools that allow to analyze the resistive transition in applied superconductivity .",
    "[ sec_22 ] non - equilibrium thermodynamics is still an area under development .",
    "one of the main fields of interest , i.e. : the study of steady states will guide us through the analysis of electrical conduction .",
    "in fact , being concentrated on quasisteady systems , the extension to irreversible transient processes ( magnetic diffusion ) will be straightforward . as an example of what can be done",
    ", we recall@xcite that based on the law of increasing entropy and also on onsager reciprocal relations , one can show that in normal conductors , the conductivity tensor must be positive definite and symmetric .",
    "this generalizes 1d ohm s law .",
    "obviously , such properties could never be deduced from the pure electromechanical principles used in the previous paragraph .",
    "thus , having the aim of a theory that generalizes sec.[sec_212 ] for type - ii superconductors , in the forthcoming , we present a minimal conceptual scenario that allows to host the main physical properties of these materials . as",
    "before , we will start introducing the main ideas by taking benefit of our knowledge of the simpler normal conductors .",
    "[ sec_221 ]    let us start by recalling some definitions .",
    "being interested in local properties of the conductor , we consider the _ mesoscopic _ entropy function @xmath50 as an average that has smoothed the statistical microscopic fluctuations .",
    "in fact , the spatial dependence comes through the current density , that will be our _ state variable _ : @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "here , @xmath52 denotes the position of a region of mesoscopic size , and nonlocal correlations are neglected . in the absence of an external action the system settles at the entropy maximum , i.e. : the stable equilibrium point @xmath53 .",
    "physically , an overwhelming amount of all possible microstates corresponds to macrostates with @xmath54 , and then @xmath55 .",
    "statistical fluctuations around such point become negligible with increasing size of the subsystem .    out of equilibrium , but not far from it , the same statistical mechanism that suppresses fluctuations",
    "will operate .",
    "thus , after a displacement caused by an external agent ( electric field in our case ) , a thermodynamic `` restoring force '' @xmath11 in sec.[sec_211 ] , drives the system along increasing entropy until @xmath56 is reached again .",
    "@xmath11 is responsible for the energy losses that may be expressed in terms of the so - called dissipation function@xcite @xmath57 , that is a measure of the amount of heat generated per unit time .",
    "macroscopically , the amount of heat generated is given by@xcite    @xmath58    as stated before , isothermal conditions will be assumed , and we will use the relation @xmath59 .",
    "now , thermodynamics enters through the so - called  principle of minimum entropy production \" @xcite that may be expressed as    * _",
    "the steady state of a system is that state in which the rate of entropy production has the minimum value consistent with the external constraints . _",
    "notice that , based on this , the equilibrium state takes its natural place when there are no constraints on the system , because as a consequence of the second law , it reaches the maximum entropy , and thus the absolute minimum of entropy production , i.e. : zero .    in order to see how the above principle operates ,",
    "let us assume that some external action ( electric field ) drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "if the constraint is removed , a transient towards equilibrium ( @xmath56 ) will occur .",
    "around this point , the function @xmath60 will allow a quadratic expansion of the kind @xmath61 with @xmath62 the components of a symmetric positive definite tensor .",
    "it is apparent that , in the absence of constraints , minimizing @xmath63 leads to the condition @xmath53 , and that the thermodynamic field driving the system towards equilibrium may be obtained as @xmath64 .",
    "its lines of force ( maximal slope of @xmath63 ) in the @xmath65-space correspond to the most probable macroscopic evolution ( faster increase of entropy ) . in steady situations ,",
    "this field _",
    "the applied electric field that verifies ohm s law ( -@xmath66 ) .",
    "on the other hand , steady states out of equilibrium will be characterized by a constrained minimization problem , in which @xmath63 has to be _ augmented _ by some lagrange multiplier . for instance , as indicated by landau@xcite , the steady current distribution within a normal conductor may be obtained by minimizing the volume integral of @xmath67 as corresponds to the stationarity condition @xmath68 .    as a main conclusion from the above paragraphs , we resolve that the behavior of a normal conductor close to equilibrium may be formulated in terms of a quadratic tensor @xmath62 ( resistivity ) that is positive definite and symmetric as dictated by thermodynamics .",
    "this obviously generalizes the one dimensional results in sec.[sec_211 ] .",
    "an additional observation is that just recalling the definition of the gradient function one can show that the electric field lines will be perpendicular to the constant level sets of the dissipation function @xmath63 .",
    "finally , variational principles allowing to afford complicated calculations as those related to the diffusion towards the _ equilibrium point _ ( @xmath69 ) or characterizing steady sates may be stated in this realm .",
    "below , we show that the ideas in this section may be exported to the case of type - ii superconductors . however , already related to the generalization of the one dimensional @xmath43 law in fig.[fig_1 ] ,",
    "some technical difficulties arise , and further analysis is required .",
    "[ sec_222 ]    in the light of sec.[sec_212 ] the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium has to be reconsidered for pinned superconductors .",
    "thus , even for the simplest one dimensional configurations , one finds a vanishing drag force not just for a point ( @xmath69 ) but within a whole segment ( region @xmath37 ) that becomes a surface , or even a volume in the @xmath70space for more complex scenarios .",
    "then , the entropy of the system will be maximal within a full set of values @xmath71 and the determination of the state from thermodynamic arguments seems flawed by ambiguity .",
    "in fact , a complex multiplicity of possible states would seem admissible . against this",
    ", one could argue that , in fact , either static or stationary configurations always occur subsequent to some diffusion process accompanied by drag forces ( electric fields ) and that  integration \" along some path within the @xmath45-space that connects the overcritical region and the eventual critical point @xmath72 can be performed .",
    "however , the following mathematical quiz arises : how does one expand a function @xmath63 towards the resistive behavior when a  starting region \" , instead of a starting point , is given ?    once more , a very general argument , uniqueness , will help .",
    "let us consider the kind of elliptical region mentioned before , that is physically meaningful as related to dissipation mechanisms in either @xmath73 or @xmath74 relative to the local magnetic field orientation . as depicted in fig.[fig_2 ]",
    ", irreversible energy dissipation corresponding to some overcritical point @xmath75 may be uniquely quantified by means of @xmath76 , i.e. : the minimum distance from the point @xmath45 to the boundary @xmath46 .",
    "geometrically , this means that expansion is done perpendicular to @xmath46 .",
    "analytically , one has to find some expression that allows to obtain the critical point @xmath77 for each value of @xmath45 . in the case of the elliptic region considered here , this entails to solve a quartic equation .",
    "of special mention is that meaningful cases@xcite as the isotropic model ( @xmath37 is a circle ) and the double critical state model ( @xmath37 is a rectangle ) produce trivial conditions for the determination of the point @xmath77 .        from the physical point of view , the above mathematical conditions",
    "imply that for small perturbations around equilibrium , the induced electric fields will keep perpendicular to the levels of constant dissipation @xmath63 .",
    "this extends our previous result@xcite that just  on surface \" ( critical state ) @xmath78 is normal to the boundary of the region @xmath37 . at least for small perturbations , a consistent theory that assumes the existence of a critical region with boundary @xmath46",
    "may be obtained by using @xmath79 and prolong this condition towards the resistive state .",
    "we call the readers attention that this general property is not restricted to the case of a region @xmath37 defined in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ". this would just fit the case of a homogeneous type - ii superconductor , whose anisotropy only depends on the local magnetic field .",
    "other physical scenarios , such as microstructure induced anisotropy are apparently tractable , just by using the required axes .",
    "for instance , one could use @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the case of uniaxial symmetry for the current flow .",
    "@xmath37 would be a cylinder with its axis parallel to the @xmath82 direction .",
    "also , one could introduce a dependence of the critical current density on the orientation of the local magnetic filed relative to some axis in the material along which pinning is favored , i.e. : define @xmath83 by a function @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , the critical state solutions of such statements were already investigated in ref.@xcite and the extension to the flux flow regime may be done in the above terms .    before pursuing a specific mathematical statement of the above concepts , some clarifying words on the physical system are still due . on the one side ,",
    "we have invoked the molecular thermal forces so as to describe the dissipative behavior beyond equilibrium . on the other side",
    ", criticality relates to a multiple number of possible `` equilibrium '' states for the system .",
    "the full framework is as follows .",
    "indeed , thermal forces acting on the long term would eventually drive the system to a true ( and unique ) thermodynamic equilibrium state with @xmath69 .",
    "however , as we are focused on small perturbations around the critical state , we just consider the fast relaxation towards a given metastable configuration determined by the applied fields and pinning forces .",
    "this corresponds to recalling that , in hard superconductors , much creep occurs in the first instances when the flux density gradient ( basically , our @xmath2 parameter ) is high @xcite .",
    "subsequent flux homogenization by flux hopping can be neglected in the magnetization processes under consideration as far as its typical time would be much beyond the experimental period .",
