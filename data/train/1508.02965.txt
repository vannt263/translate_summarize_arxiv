    "<S> , we decided to work in the nondissipative setting , for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , many results are available in the literature in this case ( see @xcite ) , and this allows us to test our methods . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the notions of fracture evolution which are used to model the cohesive dissipative case are not easy to use in applications , since they require rather delicate tools of functional analysis ( a formulation is spaces of young measures , see @xcite ) . finally , this is a relevant application for the degenerate case , where @xmath105 estimates are not available .    </S>",
    "<S> we are aware that a more realistic model should take account of the monotonicity of the crack growth , as done for instance in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this issue can be dealt with in the case of brittle fracture , thanks to the _ jump transfer lemma_. unfortunately , to date , this tool is not available in the cohesive case ( see @xcite for details ) , and even if it were existing , it would not help with the lack of @xmath105 estimates .      </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize a few relevant and defining aspects of our results .    </S>",
    "<S> * we prove the existence of an approximable quasistatic evolution for a large class of energy functions @xmath39 and linear operators @xmath35 ( see and conditions ( j1)(j4 ) in section  [ setting ] ) . in particular , these include nonsmooth and nonconvex energy functionals . </S>",
    "<S> * we stress the fact that @xmath76 is supposed to visit at different times @xmath88 _ critical points _ of the functional @xmath106 over the affine space @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is rather general , if compared to the usual requirement of focusing on global minimizers of @xmath39 over @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> an evolution along critical points is in general more realistic and physically sound . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is important to notice that the viscous approximation usually does not provide an evolution along critical points , unless one lets the viscosity to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in contrast to this well - established approximation method , our approach starts with a truly consistent approximation from the very beginning . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analysis of such an evolution is usually very involved and , in absence of dissipation , may allow for solutions @xmath87 that are just measurable in time . </S>",
    "<S> while we shall be content with the generality of our results , we have to live with the fact that our solutions may not be regular in the nondissipative case . * </S>",
    "<S> our approach is _ </S>",
    "<S> constructive_. this is an important fact since , as we shall emphasize later , the functional @xmath108 may have multiple feasible critical points at the same time @xmath88 . hence , in order to promote uniqueness of evolutions , or even just their measurability , we need to design a proper selection principle . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> , we shall design our selection _ algorithm _ in such a way that the selected critical point is the closest - in terms of euclidean distance - to the one chosen at the previous instant of time , unless it is energetically convenient to perform a `` jump '' to another significantly different phase of the system ( see formula ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a rather common and well - established behavior of several physical ( and non physical ) systems ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section 9 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this method can be easily implemented by means of a corresponding numerical method @xcite , as we will show with the above mentioned application to cohesive fracture evolution , see section [ sec : exp ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our evolution is the result of a constructive machinery ( an algorithm ) , which is designed to emulate physical principles , according to which a critical point is selected in terms of a balance between neighborliness ( accounting the euclidean path length between critical points ) and energy convenience . in our view </S>",
    "<S> , this feature is of great relevance as we provide a black box , whose outputs are solutions . * as already mentioned , the proof of the main results ( theorems [ psiteorexist ] and [ teorexist ] ) is given in a finite dimensional setting . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that , in the infinite dimensional case , the subdifferential is in general not closed with respect to the weak convergence in the domain of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> such a difficulty could be overcome by requiring that the energy functional has compact sublevels , an assumption which is quite common in literature , provided the domain of the energy is suitably chosen . on the other hand , the choice of a weaker topology for the domain may not always comply well with other conditions on the energy , that we need to prove the existence results . </S>",
    "<S> this is in particular the case of the key condition ( j3 ) ( see section  [ setting ] ) , which allows to control the virtual power , due to the external constraint , in terms of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> while not representing a major hurdle in the uncostrained case with time - dependent energy functionals , this issue seems particularly relevant for the problem we study ( see remark [ no - infinitedim ] for further details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates our choice of first dealing with a finite dimensional setting , and then extending the results to our model case ( see theorem [ quasist ] ) with a problem - specific technique . * as an important remark , we stress that in general all of the constants appearing in the technical assumptions in section [ setting ] could depend on the dimension of the considered euclidean spaces . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our results can be applied to physical systems that can assume ( a discrete or a continuum of ) infinitely many states , provided all the relevant estimates obtained are dimension free . for this reason , we state very clearly which are the parameters affecting the constants that come into play in the crucial proofs ( see remark  [ bounds constants ] and remark  [ dependence ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we give an important application to cohesive fracture evolution ( see section [ appl ] and section [ hto0 ] ) , showing how also infinite dimensional systems can be approached with our method . in particular , we eventually provide an alternative proof of the existence of evolutions of critical points for the cohesive fracture model firstly proven in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> * the numerical simulations that we provide in section  [ sec : exp ] for the cohesive fracture evolutions agree with physically relevant requirements , such as the _ crack initiation criterion _ ( see ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 4.6 ) ) , which states that a crack appears only when the maximum sustainable stress of the material is reached . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention that numerical simulations , obtained instead with the vanishing viscosity approach , have already appeared in @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that an algorithm providing critical points evolution is introduced in such a generality , especially to treat consistently and stably also nondissipative models .    </S>",
    "<S> however , it is worth mentioning that our approach , although derived independently , resembles similar methods which have appeared recently in the literature . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a related scheme has been for instance investigated in order to obtain a general existence result in a nonconvex but smooth setting . </S>",
    "<S> the author also takes into account viscous dissipation effects , and provides a constructive time rescaling , where the evolutions have a continuous dependence on time . </S>",
    "<S> this idea , in particular , generalises previous approaches for systems driven by nonconvex energy functionals ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the author shows an approximation result that in spirit is close to our theorem [ quasist ] , and to previous results in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results in @xcite are obtained under the assumption of @xmath109 regularity of the energy functional , and in an _ unconstrained _ setting . in particular , stability of critical points after passing to the limit is recovered through a very strong assumption ( ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ( 8) , theorem 2.3 ) ) , which would seem quite unnatural for a constrained nonsmooth problem .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning other contributions , we also mention that a very general incremental minimization scheme , involving a quadratic correction with a fixed parameter @xmath110 , has been just proposed in @xcite , even in connection with abstract dissipation distances in metric spaces .    </S>",
    "<S> another algorithm , showing some analogies to , has furthermore been recently considered for a case study of phase field fracture coupled with damage in @xcite . in this case , the energy is nonconvex , but separately convex in the two state variables . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , instead of adding a regularization , the authors define the discretized evolution through fixed points of an alternate minimization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case a time reparametrization , where a full energy - dissipation balance holds , is provided . </S>",
    "<S> the exploitation of similar techniques in connection with our problem is another interesting issue that we plan to pursue in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> the plan of the paper is the following . in section </S>",
    "<S> [ setting ] we state the main results of the paper , theorem  [ psiteorexist ] and theorem  [ teorexist ] , whose proofs are given in section  [ proofmain1 ] and section  [ secproof ] , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> we introduce a space mesh and spatially discretize the problem . in section [ hto0 ] </S>",
