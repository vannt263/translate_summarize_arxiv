    "many properties of the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions that seem mysterious or accidental , like the particle content , the cancellation of gauge anomalies , the quantization of the electric charge , appear natural in the context of grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "the quantitative success of gauge coupling unification in supersymmetric ( susy ) guts is remarkable and the vicinity of the gut scale to the planck scale is quite intriguing .",
    "also the observed smallness of neutrino masses , suggesting the breaking of the total lepton number l at very high energies , supports the idea of a new threshold in particle physics at the gut scale .    despite the attractiveness of the gut idea and its influence in both theoretical and experimental developments , proton decay , that represents its most characteristic prediction ,",

    "the proton decay rate in minimal susy guts depends on many parameters and there are many sources of theoretical uncertainties , such as the mass of the colour triplets whose exchange dominates the amplitudes , the hadronic matrix elements , the spectrum of susy particles , @xmath7 , unknown phases and mixing angles from the flavour sector . even by stretching the uncertainties to their limits , minimal susy su(5 )",
    "is already ruled out by now @xcite and , in general , only non - minimal schemes , considerably more complicated than the minimal ones , survive this important test @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "a related difficulty of minimal guts is how to reconcile light electroweak doublets with superheavy colour triplets , both occurring in the same gut multiplets : the so - called doublet - triplet splitting problem . in minimal guts such",
    "a splitting is achieved through a fine - tuning by fourteen orders of magnitude .",
    "even when such a splitting is obtained , either by fine - tuning or by another mechanism , in many models it is upset by radiative corrections when susy is broken and/or by non - renormalizable operators which can originate from the physics at the cut - off scale @xcite .    an appealing mechanism to achieve the desired splitting is when the grand unified symmetry is broken by the compactification mechanism in models with extra spatial dimensions @xcite . in the last years",
    "this mechanism has been reproduced in the context of simple field theoretical models , guts defined in five or more space - time dimensions @xcite . in the simplest case a single extra spatial dimension is compactified on a circle .",
    "the lagrangian of the theory is invariant under su(5 ) , but the fields are periodic only up to transformations leaving the su(5 ) algebra invariant .",
    "this requirement produces automatically a mass splitting in complete su(5 ) multiplet .",
    "for instance , in the gauge vector boson sector , the only fields that remain massless correspond to the vector bosons of the standard model .",
    "all the other states , including the extra gauge bosons @xmath8 of su(5 ) , become massive , with masses of the order of the compactification scale @xmath9 .",
    "this is a simple and elegant way to effectively break su(5 ) down to the standard model gauge group .",
    "the same boundary conditions that break the grand unified symmetry should be consistently extended to the other fields of the theory and in particular to the multiplet containing the electroweak doublets and colour triplets . as a consequence ,",
    "an automatic doublet - triplet splitting of order @xmath10 occurs , with no need of an ad hoc scalar sector .",
    "it has soon been realized that such a framework has interesting consequences also on the prediction of proton lifetime .",
    "proton could even be made stable in such a construction @xcite . in a less radical approach ,",
    "the automatic doublet - triplet splitting is accompanied by the absence of baryon - violating dimension five operators @xcite .",

    "( [ 4dmodels ] ) .",
    "second , the coupling of the gauge vector bosons @xmath8 to ordinary fermions differs , in general , from four - dimensional susy su(5 ) . this has to do with the freedom of introducing matter fields either as ` bulk ' fields , depending on the extra spatial dimension , or as ` brane ' fields , localized in a particular four - dimensional subspace of the full space - time .    in this paper",

    "moreover such minimal realizations of the grand unification idea are also plagued by serious theoretical problems , first of all the doublet - triplet splitting problem , requiring a tuning by fourteen orders of magnitude .",
    "an elegant solution of the doublet - triplet splitting problem is offered by susy guts where the gut symmetry is broken by the compactification of an extra dimension .",
    "there is a whole class of such guts where the leading baryon - violating operators arise from gauge vector boson exchange , have dimension six and scale as the inverse of the compactification mass @xmath3 squared .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath3 form a next - to - leading analysis of gauge coupling unification including susy and gut threshold corrections , two - loop running and su(5)-breaking boundary terms .",
    "we have carefully estimated the uncertainties due to experimental errors and poor theoretical knowledge , such as the ignorance about the susy breaking spectrum and about the details of the su(5)-breaking brane dynamics . in view of the existing intrinsic theoretical uncertainties",
    "we have found a wide range of acceptable values for @xmath3 , going from approximately @xmath91 gev to more than @xmath138 gev .",
    "the consequences on proton decay strongly depend on the features of the flavour sector , which can be considerably different from the standard , four - dimensional one . in the simplest case",
    "all matter fields have the same location in the extra space and proton decay proceeds mainly via the @xmath5 channel , without any flavour suppression .",
    "such a scenario is strongly disfavoured by now , since @xmath3 is on average much smaller than the four - dimensional unification scale @xmath139 gev .",
    "however , due to the large uncertainties on @xmath3 , it is not yet ruled out and future facilities can essentially complete the test of this model .",
    "when matter fields have no identical location in the extra dimension , fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles are more naturally described . in our analysis",
    "we have considered two options , corresponding to `` semianarchy '' ( option i ) and `` anarchy '' ( option ii ) in the neutrino sector . in option",
    "i the suppression coming from flavour mixing is too strong and proton decay is almost beyond the possibilities of the next generation of experiments . in option",
    "ii the flavour suppression of the @xmath6 channel can be compensated by the allowed smallness of @xmath3 resulting in a proton lifetime well within the reach of future facilities .",
