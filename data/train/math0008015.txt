    "<S> a complete surface of constant mean curvature @xmath0 ( cmc-@xmath0 ) in hyperbolic @xmath1-space with constant curvature @xmath2 has two natural notions of `` total curvature'' one is the _ total absolute curvature _ which is the integral over the surface of the absolute value of the gaussian curvature , and the other is the _ dual total absolute curvature _ which is the total absolute curvature of the dual cmc-@xmath0 surface . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we completely classify cmc-@xmath0 surfaces with dual total absolute curvature at most @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we give new examples and partially classify cmc-@xmath0 surfaces with dual total absolute curvature at most @xmath4 .    with the developments of the last decade on constant mean curvature @xmath0 ( -@xmath0 ) surfaces in hyperbolic @xmath1-space @xmath5 ( the complete simply - connected @xmath1-manifold of constant sectional curvature @xmath2 ) , and with so many examples now known , </S>",
    "<S> it is a natural next step to classify all such surfaces with low total absolute curvature .    as -@xmath0 surfaces in @xmath5 share quite similar properties with minimal surfaces in euclidean @xmath1-space @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> let us first comment that the total absolute curvature of a minimal surface in @xmath6 is equal to the area ( counted with multiplicity ) of the gauss image of the surface , and that complete minimal surfaces in @xmath6 with total curvature at most @xmath4 have been classified . </S>",
    "<S> ( see lopez  @xcite and also table  [ tab : minimal ] . ) furthermore , as the gauss map of a complete conformally parametrized minimal surface is holomorphic , and has a well - defined limit at each end when the surface has finite total curvature , the area of the gauss image must be an integer multiple of @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of classifying low total curvature -@xmath0 surfaces in @xmath5 is analogous  however , unlike minimal surfaces in @xmath6 , -@xmath0 surfaces in @xmath5 have two gauss maps : the hyperbolic gauss map @xmath7 and the secondary gauss map @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> so there are two ways to pose the question in @xmath5 , with two very different answers . </S>",
    "<S> one way is to consider the true total absolute curvature , which is the area of the image of @xmath8 , but since @xmath8 might not be single - valued on the surface , the total curvature might not be an integer multiple of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for many more possibilities and makes the problem more difficult than for minimal surfaces in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the authors take up this question in a separate paper @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second way , which is the theme of this paper , is to study the area of the image of @xmath7 , which we call the _ dual _ total absolute curvature , as it is the true total curvature of the dual -@xmath0 surface ( which we define in section  [ sec : summary ] ) in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this way has the advantage that @xmath7 is single - valued on the surface , and so the dual total curvature is always an integer multiple of @xmath3 , like the case of minimal surfaces in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dual total curvature satisfies not only the cohn - vossen inequality , but also the hyperbolic analogue of the osserman inequality ( which can not be said about the true total curvature ) @xcite ( see also in section  [ sec : prelim ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the dual total curvature shares more properties with the total curvature of minimal surfaces in @xmath6 , motivating our interest in it .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we classify -@xmath0 surfaces with dual total absolute curvature at most @xmath3 , and we go much of the way toward classifying -@xmath0 surfaces with dual total absolute curvature at most @xmath4 ( as a first step to a full classification of the @xmath4 case ) . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we give a summary of the results , and in section  [ sec : prelim ] we give preliminaries for the latter sections . </S>",
    "<S> the classification of -@xmath0 surfaces with dual total absolute curvature less than or equal to @xmath3 is given in section  [ sec:4-pi ] . </S>",
    "<S> surfaces with dual total absolute curvature @xmath4 are discussed in section  [ sec:8-pi ]  and there we find new examples , we classify certain cases , and we show nonexistence in certain other cases . in section  [ sec : deform ] , from deformations of corresponding minimal surfaces in @xmath6 , we produce two classes of new -@xmath0 surfaces with dual total absolute curvature @xmath4 . for the readers convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we attach appendix  [ app : log ] to explain the computation of log - term coefficients of second order linear ordinary differential equations with regular singularities . </S>"
