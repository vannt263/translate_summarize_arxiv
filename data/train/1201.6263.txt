    "half - metallic heusler compounds of the type co@xmath0yz ( with y a 3__d _ _ transition metal and z an _",
    "_ main group element ) are promising materials for spin electronics .",
    "they were shown to follow the slater - pauling rule , which gives their magnetization per formula unit as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of valence electrons.@xcite co@xmath0fesi is the heusler compound with the highest observed magnetization of nearly @xmath6 per formula unit.@xcite    the electronic structures of half - metallic heusler compounds are routinely computed within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the local ( spin ) density and generalized gradient approximations ( lda or gga ) are often able to reproduce the observed ground - state magnetic moments in agreement with experimental data .",
    "however , co@xmath0fesi is a case , for which these approximations fail : the calculated magnetic moment is too low and the density of states is not half - metallic . because of this , approaches to go beyond the ( semi-)local approximations were tested . applying lda@xmath1 in the fully localized limit with u around 4ev opens a minority gap around @xmath7 and consequently gives the full magnetic moment.@xcite calculations with the non - empirical hybrid pbe0 functional resulted in a half - metallic ground state with a 1ev wide minority gap.@xcite the lda@xmath1 ( or gga@xmath1 ) approach has been applied to study the electronic structure of co@xmath0fesi and related compounds.@xcite    although co@xmath0fesi satisfies the slater - pauling rule and has a near - integer magnetic moment per formula unit , which is a necessary condition for half - metallic ferromagnetism , there is some experimental evidence to the contrary .",
    "tunnel magnetoresistance experiments show rather low tmr with co@xmath0fesi electrodes , and the conductance curves lack characteristic features of the minority gap.@xcite further , the gilbert damping is quite high.@xcite on the other hand , a temperature independent resistivity is observed for bulk single- and polycrystalline co@xmath0fesi below 50k , which is seen as a fingerprint of half - metallicity.@xcite    recently , kallmayer _ et al . _",
    "predicted from first - principles calculations the x - ray magnetic linear dichroism ( xmld ) of co@xmath0fesi within the lda and the lda@xmath1 schemes.@xcite no significant differences of the x - ray absorption or circular dichroism spectra were predicted .",
    "however , clearly different xmld spectra were computed , and xmld was proposed as a tool to determine which electronic structure is actually present in co@xmath0fesi . in this article",
    "we use the proposed method on epitaxial thin films of co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the article is organized as follows : sections [ sec : experiment ] and [ sec : computational ] describe the experimental conditions and details of our computational approach .",
    "the results of the x - ray magnetic circular ( xmcd ) and linear dichroism measurements and calculations are presented in section [ sec : results ] , followed by a discussion of the results in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    ". the main part of this article is focused on the understanding of the xmld of co@xmath0fesi . to make sure that the dichroic signals are intrinsical to co@xmath0fesi",
    ", we investigated samples prepared with different deposition conditions .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : moments ]    all characteristic features that have been observed by other authors for co@xmath0fesi are present in our xas / xmcd spectra as well : the shoulders on the trailing edges of the absorption edges , and the feature in the co spectra 4ev above the absorption onset.@xcite the latter arises from an _",
    "s_-_d _ hybrid state of co and si .",
    "the luminescence spectra ( not shown ) are in good agreement with the tey data .",
    "the element specific magnetic moments are extracted from a sum rule analysis of the spectra , assuming the radial @xmath8 transition matrix constants @xmath9ev and @xmath10ev according to ref . .",
    "the spin moment ratio determined from tey is @xmath11 , whereas the ratio from luminescence detection is @xmath12 .",
    "both samples have extrapolated low - temperature magnetizations of @xmath13/f.u .",
    "( determined by vsm ) ; using this value to scale the xmcd sum rule results , we find element - resolved moments as given in table [ tab : moments ] .",
    "the scaling removes experimental uncertainties with respect to the magnetic saturation of the samples .    with the white line sum rule from ref .",
    ", we obtain the numbers of _ d _ holes : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are significantly higher than the values for the pure elements ( 2.4 and 3.45 , respectively).@xcite the analysis of the sum rules rests on the assumption that the radial @xmath8 transition matrix constants are independent of the chemical environment .",
    "this might be true within about 10% and gives rise to a corresponding error .",
    "further , there is some uncertainty due to the background subtraction , which we estimate to be of the order of 10% as well .",
    "fundamental x - ray magnetic linear dichroism spectra of co in co@xmath0fesi , taken in total electron yield .",
    "the normalization is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmcd].,width=325 ]    fundamental x - ray magnetic linear dichroism spectra of fe in co@xmath0fesi , taken in total electron yield .",
    "the normalization is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmcd].,width=325 ]      the xmld is generally measured as the difference between two absorption spectra taken with linearly polarized light ; one with the polarization vector parallel to the magnetization , and one perpendicular . expressed with tey intensities , i.e. @xmath16 . the xmld has a large crystal anisotropy .",
    "it was shown for cubic systems that all xmld spectra can be described as a linear combination of two fundamental spectra , which are measured along the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] high symmetry directions , respectively.@xcite earlier reports of xmld of heusler compounds include co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0mnal,@xcite mn@xmath0coga and mn@xmath0vga,@xcite and co@xmath0tisn.@xcite    the xmld spectra of cfs - cr are presented in figures [ fig : xmld_co ] and [ fig : xmld_fe ] .",
    "the spectra have pronounced substructures , and the intensities are quite large . for co , the maximum xmld intensity is found in the [ 110 ] direction at the l@xmath17 edge , and amounts to 7.1% with respect to the l@xmath17 resonance height .",
    "the maximum intensity for fe is observed at the l@xmath17 edge in the [ 100 ] direction , and it amounts to 6.9% . for co ,",
    "the maximum xmld is twice as large in the [ 110 ] direction than in the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "in contrast , for fe the signal strengths are similar in the two fundamental directions .    comparing the co xmld spectra with the available published data of other heusler compounds",
    ", we note that the [ 110 ] spectra are very similar in all cases ( co@xmath0mnsi , co@xmath0mnal , co@xmath0tisn , and mn@xmath0coga).@xcite the only exception is co@xmath0mnsi , which has a sharper , and more detailed structure . telling _",
    "_ ascribe this ( in particular in comparison with co@xmath0mnal ) to the half - metallic character of co@xmath0mnsi and the associated localized character of the _ d _",
    "electrons.@xcite this could hint at the lack of half - metallic character in co@xmath0fesi .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the xmld of heusler compounds depends on the square of the spin moment , modified by the degree of localization of the magnetic moment.@xcite the maximum co xmld intensity along [ 110 ] at the l@xmath17 edge as a function of the square of the co spin moment ( @xmath18 , using the tey values for consistency ) is weaker than for co@xmath0mnal ( @xmath19 ) , co@xmath0mnsi ( @xmath20 ) , or co@xmath0tisn ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the heights of the l@xmath17 resonances with respect to the background are comparable among these compounds , so this normalization is reasonable .",
    "this hints at not fully localized co moments , and indicates the lack of half - metallicity as well .",
    "still , co@xmath0fesi has the largest xmld observed for co in a heusler compound due to its large magnetic moment .",
    "the co [ 100 ] xmld spectrum of co@xmath0fesi is different from the spectra of the other compounds mainly by a positive contribution at the maximum of the l@xmath17 resonance , which is very weak in the other cases .",
    "xmld spectra of fe containing heusler compounds are not available in the literature .",
    "however , our spectra are clearly different from xmld spectra of pure fe films grown on gaas(001).@xcite notably , the fe spectra of co@xmath0fesi are similar to the mn xmld spectra of co@xmath0mnsi.@xcite the [ 110 ] spectra have a double - peak contribution at the low - energy side of the l@xmath17 edge and a negative contribution at the high - energy side . the l@xmath0 edge is even more similar .",
    "for the [ 100 ] direction we observe a similar resemblance , but mn has a small positive contribution at the absorption onset , which is missing for fe . the maximum xmld intensity of fe as defined above ( @xmath22 ) is close to that of mn in co@xmath0mnsi ( @xmath23 ) or co@xmath0mnal ( @xmath24),@xcite and larger than in pure fe ( @xmath25).@xcite fe and mn occupy the same site of the heusler structure and experience similar local crystal fields .",
    "the larger xmld intensity of fe in co@xmath0fesi compared to pure fe indicates a more localized character of the magnetic moment .",
    "these findings emphasize the high site specificity of the xmld and its sensitivity to the local crystal field .        in figure",
    "[ fig : xmld_samples ] we compare the xmld spectra of our samples taken in luminescence detection mode .",
    "the intensities are given as percentages of the l@xmath17 absorption peak .",
    "the main purpose of this comparison is to verify that the xmld spectra are essentially independent of the deposition conditions and specific details of the films .",
    "the various spectra are very similar throughout the samples , and only small differences are seen for the intensities of individual features .",
    "these differences may be associated with the slightly lower degree of l2@xmath26 ordering in the cfs - cr sample .",
    "four computational approaches are compared with experiment : plain gga , gga fixed spin moment ( fsm ) , lda@xmath1 ( @xmath27ev ) , and gga@xmath1 ( @xmath28ev ) .",
    "for lda@xmath1 we adopt the @xmath29 value of references . in our gga@xmath1 approach",
    ", we can use a slightly lower @xmath29 than in lda@xmath1 to obtain the full magnetic moment . in the latter case ,",
    "at least 2.5ev are required ; here , we adopt the smallest value that results in the full magnetic moment . this value was also used in ref . within a gga@xmath1 approach .",
    "the total magnetic moment neglecting spin - orbit coupling with the plain gga ( with the pbe functional ) is 5.53@xmath3 , which is in good agreement with previously reported values.@xcite figure [ fig : xmld_theory ] shows the theoretical and experimental spectra for co and fe along the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] directions",
    ".    the general shape of the gga spectra is quite similar to the experimental ones , but the width of the theoretical curves is considerably too small .",
    "the gga fsm description improves considerably the width and general shape of the spectra , and gives a very good overall resemblance of the experimental data of co [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] , and fe [ 100 ] .",
    "in contrast , both the lda@xmath1 and gga@xmath1 spectra do not describe the experimental data . for fe [ 100 ] ,",
    "the l@xmath17 spectra are inverted , and the co spectra have spurious substructures .",
    "further , the co spectra are broader than the experimental data .",
    "the computed _ d _ band width is consequently too large .",
    "the fe [ 110 ] spectra are very similar in the gga , gga fsm and lda / gga@xmath1 approaches .",
    "all of them have a negative contribution at the absorption onset , which is positive in the experiment .",
    "some features at the high energy side of the l@xmath17 edges in the experimental spectra are not captured by any theoretical approach - these are marked with arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmld_theory ] . in the co spectra",
    ", these features are associated with the co - si _",
    "s_-_d _ hybrid state .",
    "since our one - electron theory fails to describe these features , we conclude they are associated with many - body effects .",
    "electron  hole correlations , in particular the formation of bound excitons ( which lead to the so - called multiplet splittings in the absorption spectra ) , are often observed in the l@xmath30 x - ray absorption spectra of 3__d _ _ transition metal atoms in insulators .",
    "however , these effects are virtually absent in the spectra of metals , and reduce to a change in the branching ratio away from the statistical 2:1 in the early 3__d _ _ transition metals .",
    "laskowski and blaha have shown by solving the bethe - salpeter - equation in an all - electron framework that the dielectric response of the system plays a crucial role for these effects.@xcite the formation of the splittings is governed by the screened coulomb interaction of the excited electron with the core - hole . in a ( half-)metal , this interaction is exponentially screened out , so that only small changes of the spectra remain . in a recent paper",
    "we have demonstrated that this effect is of the order 0.3ev for co in co@xmath0tisn by means of core - hole calculations in the independent - particle - approximation,@xcite whereas the unoccupied _ d _ band width is of the order 2ev here .",
    "thus , due to the metallic screening of the coulomb interaction it is reasonable to assume that independent - electron calculations can give a good description of the x - ray absorption spectra of co@xmath0fesi .",
    "from the comparison of the calculations , it becomes clear that gga fsm provides the best overall matching of the experimental data , and can serve to model the unoccupied band structure of co@xmath0fesi .",
    "based on the gga fsm electronic structure we have computed the number of _ d _ holes of fe and co. this has to be done with care in the flapw method , because these numbers depend on the choice of the muffin tin radii .",
    "therefore we computed the hole numbers with different choices of muffin tin radii and selected the ones for which the partial magnetic moments saturate - the relevant part of the _ d _ orbitals is then presumably entirely contained in the muffin - tins .",
    "these radii ( 2.2a.u . ) were used for all calculations throughout this work ( muffin tin radii of 2.28a.u .",
    "correspond to maximum space filling ) .",
    "the corresponding numbers of _ d _ holes are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "both are a bit smaller than the values extracted with the white line sum rule ( see section [ subsec : xmcd ] ) .",
    "however , they are larger than the theoretical hole numbers of the pure elements , which amount to 2.4 and 3.45 , respectively.@xcite our values are close to the numbers of unoccupied _ d _ states of the free co and fe atoms",
    ". this atomic - like configuration could be the reason for the failure of the pbe functional to obtain the correct magnetic moment .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments within the gga fsm approach are @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the interstitial contribution is almost zero .",
    "the calculated spin moment ratio is 2 , which is smaller than the experimental value .",
    "the orbital moments are underestimated by a factor of about 2.3 , which is typically observed in dft calculations without orbital corrections.@xcite    we note that it is still an open question why bulk magnetometry of presumably half - metallic heusler compounds gives the integer slater - pauling values , which are only valid in the complete abscence of valence - band spin - orbit coupling .",
    "xmcd does , however , always give small orbital moments , which should increase the total moment .",
    "kune _ et al . _ proposed a theoretical model of the xmld , in which the xmld is given as an energy derivative of differences of the unoccupied @xmath37 and @xmath38 densities of states : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the core - level exchange splitting , and @xmath41 are constants , which take the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the [ 100 ] magnetization direction.@xcite the energy dependence has been omitted for clarity .",
    "this model is only valid without spin - orbit coupling , which lifts the degeneracies of the crystal - field split doubly and triply degenerate _",
    "d _ states .",
    "however , this model gives an instructive picture of the local crystal field sensitivity of the xmld .",
    "consequently , the large differences observed for the gga fsm and gga@xmath1 spectra along the [ 100 ] direction indicate significant changes in the distribution of the orbital symmetries ( irreducible representations ) of the _ d _ states .",
    "top : total densities of states of co@xmath0fesi with the gga fixed spin moment ( fsm ) and gga@xmath1 ( 1.9ev ) approaches .",
    "the insets show the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the light blue line in the top panel represents the gga calculation .",
    "bottom : partial densities of states of co and fe in the two computational approaches .",
    "the spectra are decomposed into the irreducible representations ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) of the _ d _ states .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is neglected.,width=321 ]    in figure [ fig : dos ] we compare the total dos of the gga fsm calculation and the gga@xmath1 calculation neglecting spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the gap widths and positions of the fermi levels are different , and the width of the unoccupied minority _",
    "states is larger in the gga@xmath1 calculation .",
    "the size of the minority gap in the gga@xmath1 calculation is about @xmath46 .",
    "the gga fsm density of states is essentially the same as that of a plain gga calculation , with the majority and minority states being rigidly shifted against each other . due to their overall similarity ,",
    "typical experimental techniques that probe the dos ( photoemission , inverse photoemission , x - ray absorption ) are hardly able to distinguish between the models of the electronic structure .    by decomposing the individual _",
    "projections into their orbital symmetries , we are able to observe differences between the gga fsm and gga@xmath1 models .",
    "this is shown in the bottom part of figure [ fig : dos ] .",
    "the dos of the two orbital symmetries ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) have entirely different structures in the two calculations .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 states are more split in gga@xmath1 ( i.e. , the crystal field is stronger ) , and the hybridization between co and fe @xmath45 states becomes stronger as well .",
    "the co @xmath44 states are broader in gga@xmath1 , and the fe @xmath45 states have a larger weight in gga@xmath1 than in gga fsm .",
    "the crystal field splitting is the driving mechanism for the gap creation in the half - metallic heusler compounds.@xcite obviously , the @xmath1 operator ( in the fll formulation ) enhances the crystal field splitting and forms the half - metallic gap .",
    "it has been shown that the lda@xmath1 formalism can be derived as an approximation to the quasiparticle self - energy within the _ gw _ method.@xcite the derivation involves three assumptions : ( 1 ) the screened coulomb interaction ( described by @xmath29 ) is static ; ( 2 ) only localized states are subject to the quasiparticle corrections ; ( 3 ) the many - body exchange interaction between localized and itinerant electrons is neglected .",
    "thus , lda@xmath1 is a kind of on - site hartee - fock theory with the effective screening given by the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "it does provide results that are quite similar to those from the hybrid pbe0 functional.@xcite the inclusion of hartree - fock exchange without the proper spacial and frequency dependence of the screening ( i.e. , the correlation ) allows to obtain the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi correctly , but fails at the correct prediction of the unoccupied states band structure .",
    "the gga is able to describe the wave functions and unoccupied states reasonably well up to a rigid shift of the latter .",
    "since the gga can be seen as a static , local , and orbital - independent approximation to the _ gw _ self - energy , the success of reproducing the xmld spectra well is based on a cancellation of errors , due to omission of both the non - locality and the frequency dependence in the exchange and correlation contributions .",
    "the good balance between exchange and correlation in the lda ( and gga , which is essentially the same theory ) has been confirmed earlier by kotani and grning _ et al . _",
    "these authors have performed calculations of transition metal and semiconductor band structures with the exx+rpa approach , which treats exchange and correlation on the same level of many - body perturbation theory.@xcite exx+rpa reproduced the lda results well , including magnetic moments and exchange splittings of fe , co , and ni . however , for mno , where screening is weak , exx+rpa gave substantial improvement of the band structure.@xcite furthermore , _",
    "calculations on half - metallic cras and mnas by damewood and fong@xcite demonstrated that the gga can predict half - metallic gaps that are very close to the _ gw _ values , depending on the details of the local fields and the associated screening .",
    "the gga fsm band structure has a small gap ( about 0.1ev wide ) in the minority states , and the fermi energy is located in the gap .",
    "inclusion of spin - orbit coupling closes this small gap .",
    "this observation may explain the rather low tmr values of magnetic tunnel junctions with co@xmath0fesi electrodes , the lack of half - metallic characteristics in the tunneling conductance curves , and the large gilbert damping.@xcite",
    "our experimental results show that the features associated with the gga@xmath1 band structure are not present in co@xmath0fesi .",
    "gga@xmath1 predicts an inadequate distribution of the crystal - field split _ d _ states , which we identified by x - ray magnetic linear dichroism .",
    "the @xmath1 operator opens a minority gap at the fermi energy , which necessarily leads to an integer magnetic moment . while exchange and correlation effects beyond the gga are certainly important for the description of co@xmath0fesi , the simple @xmath1 approach does not produce the correct band structure .",
    "the pbe functional is able to produce an unoccupied states band structure for co@xmath0fesi which is approximately correct up to a rigid shift of the minority _ d _ states .",
    "co@xmath0fesi is a complex material , being neither close to the electron gas ( the gga fails to find the correct ground state magnetic moment ) , nor being strongly correlated ( gga@xmath1 fails at the description of spectral properties ) . that calls for further refinement of the approximations to the density functional .",
    "more flexible functional forms , such as meta - gga functionals ( adding information on the kinetic energy density ) , may perform better in this respect .",
    "co@xmath0fesi is therefore an interesting test case for new density functionals .",
    "ultimately , many - body approaches , such as exx+rpa,@xcite the _ gw _ approximation ( possibly including some kind of self - consistency ) , or dmft@xcite might be required to obtain a consistent theoretical picture of co@xmath0fesi .",

    "<S> our findings give evidence for the inadequacy of the lda@xmath1 or gga@xmath1 band structures , whereas constrained calculations with the gga and a fixed spin moment of 6@xmath3 give better overall agreement between experiment and theory . </S>"
