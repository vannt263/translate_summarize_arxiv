    "the study of the physics of accretion onto compact objects ( neutron stars and black holes ) whether in galactic ( x - ray binaries ) or extragalactic systems ( active galactic nuclei ) involves length scales much too small to be resolved by current technology or that of the foreseeable future . as such , this study is conducted mainly through the theoretical interpretation of spectral and temporal observations of these systems , much in the way that the study of spectroscopic binaries has been used to deduce the properties of the binary system members and the elements of their orbit . in this endeavor ,",
    "the first line of attack in unfolding their physical properties is the analysis of their spectra . for this class of objects and in particular the black hole candidate ( bhc ) sources , a multitude of observations",
    "have indicated that their energy spectra can be fitted very well by comptonization of soft photons by hot electrons ; the latter are  naturally \" expected to be present in these sources , a result of the dissipation of the accretion kinetic energy within an accretion disk .",
    "it is thus generally agreed upon that comptonization is the process by which the high energy ( @xmath1 kev ) spectra of these sources are formed , with the study of this process receiving hence great attention over the past couple of decades ( see e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; titarchuk 1994 ; hua & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "thus , while the issue of the detailed dynamics of accretion onto the compact object is still not resolved , the assumption of the presence of a thermal distribution of hot electrons in the vicinity of the compact object has proven sufficient to produce models which successfully fit the spectra of the emerging high energy radiation .",
    "spectral fitting has subsequently been employed as a way to constrain or even determine the dynamics of accretion onto the compact object .",
    "it is well known , however , that the comptonization spectra can not provide , in and of themselves , any information about the size of the scattering plasma , because they depend ( in the case of optically thin plasmas ) on the product of the electron temperature and total probability of photon scattering in the plasma , a quantity proportional to its thomson depth .",
    "therefore , they can not provide any clues about the dynamics of accretion of the hot gas onto the compact object , which require the knowledge of the density and velocity as a function radius . to determine the dynamics of accretion",
    ", one needs , in addition to the spectra , time variability information .",
    "it is thought , however , that such information may not be terribly relevant , because it is generally accepted that the x - ray emission originates at the smallest radii of the accreting flow and as such , time variability would simply reflect the dynamical or scattering time scales of the emission region , of order of msec for galactic accreting sources and @xmath2 times longer for agn .",
    "recent rxte ( focke , private communication ) as well as older heao-1 observations ( meekins et al .",
    "1984 ) of the bhc cyg x-1 , which resolved x - ray flares of duration @xmath3 a few msec , appear to provide a validation of our simplest expectations . at the same time , however , the x - ray fluctuation power spectral densities ( psd ) of accreting compact sources generally contain most of their power at frequencies @xmath4 hz , far removed from the khz frequencies expected on the basis of the arguments given above .",
    "flares of a few msec in duration , while present in the x - ray light curves of cyg x-1 , contribute but a very small fraction to its overall variability as manifest in its psd , which exhibits very little power at frequencies @xmath0 30 hz ( cui et al . 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , this form of the psd has been reported in addition to cyg x-1 also in the bhc gx 339 - 4 and nova muscae ginga data ( see e.g. miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "this discrepancy between the observed and the expected distribution of the variability power of bhc sources , hints that one may have to revise the notion that the entire hard x - ray emission of these sources derives from a region a few schwarzschild radii in size and indicates the need of more detailed models of the timing properties of these systems . in this respect ,",
    "models of the timing properties of accreting compact sources have been rather limited ( with the exception of models of the quasi - periodic oscillations ) , the reason being , ( on the theoretical side ) the largely aperiodic character of their light curves and ( on the experimental side ) the lack of sufficiently large area detectors , in conjunction with high telemetry rates which would provide high timing resolution data . as a consequence , the study and modeling of these class of sources has concentrated mainly on their spectra , whose s / n ratios can be improved by longer exposure times .",
    "thus , the literature associated with models of the spectra of bhc sources is substanially larger than that of their timing models .",
    "much of the earlier work in modeling the aperiodic light curves of bhc sources was kinematic in character , aimed in its deconvolution in elementary events with the goal of providing fits to the observed psds .",
    "thus , lochner ( 1989 ) was able to reproduce the observed psds as the ensemble of incoherent , exponential shots of durations ranging from 0.01 to 1 secs , while lochner , swank & szymkoviak ( 1991 ) searched ( unsuccessfully ) for a low dimensional attractor in the light curve of cyg x-1 .",
    "in a similar fashion , abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) produced model light curves with psds similar to those observed , resulting from a large number of bright spots in an accretion disk .",
    "more recently , a number of dynamical models have appeared in the literature : chen & taam ( 1995 ) produce time variability as a result of hydrodynamic instabilities of an accretion disk , while takeuchi , mineshige & negoro ( 1995 ) use a model of self - organized criticality to simulate accretion onto the compact object .",
    "both these models provide reasonable fits to the observed psd shapes ( however , not necessarily to their normalizations ) by producing a modulation of the accretion rate onto the compact object .",
    "models of the type just described , generally aim to account for only the simplest of variability tests , namely the psd , and usually they have enough freedom to be able to match the shape of the observed psds .",
    "however , in most of them , the associated light curves are very much different than those observed , testimony to the fact that the power spectrum erases all the phase information available in the signal and that very different light curves can in fact have identical psds .",
    "we are aware of only one effort to keep track and search for correlations in the phases of the different fourier components in the light curves of low luminosity agn ( krolik , done & madejski 1993 ) .",
    "the conclusion of this search was that the process responsible for the agn variability ( at least the ones studied in the above reference ) is incoherent , in the sense that the phases of the various fourier components are uncorrelated and apparently random .    in this respect",
    ", one should note that the very fact that the spectra of these sources are due to comptonization of soft photons has several direct implications concerning the phases of photons of different energies : because , on the average , it takes longer to produce a photon of high energy compared to that of a lower energy , the energy of the escaping photons increases with their residence time in the scattering medium .",
    "thus , while there may not be any coherence in the _ absolute _ phases of the various fourier components of the light curves of this class of sources , the _ relative _ phases between photons in two different energy bands may not be random , provided that the observed radiation is produced by a single hot electron cloud rather than a large number of individual , disjoint sites . as a result",
    ", the hard photon light curves should lag with respect to those of softer photons by amounts which depend on the photon scattering time in the plasma .",
    "if the sources are of rather limited spatial extent and the scattering takes place only in the vicinity of the compact object , then the corresponding time lags should be roughly constant ( independent of the fourier frequency ) and of order of the scattering time in this medium , i.e. @xmath5 sec for galactic sources and correspondingly larger for agn .",
    "on the other hand , if the scattering medium is extended , the lags should cover a temporal range which depends on the characteristics of the scattering medium .",
    "searches for these lags in the light curves of the bhc sources cyg x-1 and gx 339 - 4 in the ginga ( miyamoto et al . 1988 , 1991 ) and the more recent rxte data ( cui et al .",
    "1997b ) , have detected their presence and , more important , discovered that the hard time lags @xmath6 depend on the fourier period @xmath7 , increasing roughly linearly with @xmath7 from @xmath80.001 sec at @xmath9 sec to @xmath8 0.1 sec for @xmath10 sec .",
    "these long lags and in particular their dependence on the fourier period @xmath7 are very difficult to interpret in the context of a model in which the x - ray emission is due to soft photon comptonization in the vicinity of the compact object ; in such a model , the hard lags should simply reflect the photon scattering time in the specific region ( i.e. @xmath11 msec ) and moreover , they should be independent of the fourier frequency .",
    "while this type of time lag was found originally in the light curve of the bhc cyg x-1 , similar lag behavior has been recorded also for the transient j0422 + 32 ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) and also the source grs 1758 - 258 ( smith et al . 1997 ) . finally , to indicate that these results may not be universal , the data of wilms et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicate that the lags associated with cyg x-1 during their observation , increase much more gradually .",
    "motivated by the discrepancies between our expectations of x - ray variability based on simple dynamical models and the observed form of their psds and their frequency dependent hard lags , we have revisited the issue of time variability of bhc sources ( kazanas , hua & titarchuk 1997 , hearafter kht ; hua , kazanas & titarchuk 1997 , hearafter hkt ; hua , kazanas & cui 1999 , hereafter hkc ) .",
    "the central point of our considerations has been that , contrary to the prevailing notions about the timing behavior of accreting sources , features in the observed psd correspond not to variations in the accretion rate but rather to properties of the electron density distribution of an extended ( @xmath12 ; rather than a compact @xmath13 ) hot electron corona . with this assumption in place , features in the psds translate to well defined properties of the scattering corona which can in principle be checked for consistency with observations .",
    "thus we have proposed that the low frequency ( @xmath14 hz ) break of the psd to white noise is associated with the outer edge of the comptonizing corona , while its inner edge is very close to the compact source .",
    "we further indicated that the power law - like psds depend on both the density profile and the total thomson depth of the corona , implying correlations between the energy and the variability power spectra , which can be sought for in the data .    using this extended corona model",
    ", we were able to show explicitly that the observed energy spectra convey rather limited information about the structure of the scattering medium ( kht , hkc ) and that very different hot electron configurations can indeed yield the same energy spectrum as long as the _ total _ probability of scattering remains the same across the different configurations .",
    "we have also shown ( hkc ) that the fact that the lags between different energy bands depend on the _ differential _ probability of scattering at a given range of radii ( contrary to the spectrum which depends on the total probability ) affords a means of _ probing the density structure of the corona _ through the study of the lag dependence on the fourier period @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we were able to show that due to the linearity of compton scattering , the coherence function ( as defined by vaughan & nowak 1996 ) of the extended hot corona configuration is very close to one , in agreement with observations ( vaughan & nowak 1996 ) , suggesting , in addition , that the properties of the scattering hot electron cloud remain constant over the observation time scales ( hua , kazanas & titarchuk 1997 ) .",
    "thus the timing observations indicate , on one hand , that the absolute phase of the light curves of accreting compact objects are random , implying an incoherent process , while on the other hand that the relative phases between different energy bands are indeed extremely well correlated , indicating a coherent underlying process .",
    "the puropose of the present paper is to produce model light curves of accreting compact sources compatible with these apparently contradictory aspects of their coherence as well as the observed psds .",
    "we also examine the structure of the latter ( including the presence of qpos ) and their dependence on the sources luminosity in the general context of these models . having provided a prescription for producing model light curves , we subsequently examine their properties in the time rather than frequency domain and indicate tests which may confirm or disprove the fundamentals of our model .    in  2 we outline the extended corona configuration under consideration and we present models of the comptonization response function and the corresponding power spectra associated with it .",
    "we also elaborate on the fundamental tenet of our models , namely that of association of psd features with corresponding features in the density structure of the extended corona by providing a generic qpo model within this framework . in ",
    "3 we provide a prescription for generating model light curves using the coronal response function and we do generate a number of such curves for different values of the model parameters . with the model light curves at hand , we further elaborate our analysis by computing and comparing their attributes to observation : thus in  4 we compute phase lags as a function of the fourier frequency and in  5 the associated autocorrelation and skewness functions .",
    "finally , in  6 the results are summarized and discussed .",
    "kazanas , hua & titarchuk ( 1997 ) proposed that the timing properties of bhc discussed above , i.e. the psd and the form and frequency dependence of the time or phase lags , can be easily accounted for with the assumption that all associated variability is due to the compton scattering of soft photons in an extended , non - uniform corona surrounding the compact object and spanning several decades in radius .",
    "specifically , they proposed the following density profile for the comptonizing medium :    @xmath15    where the power index @xmath16 is a free parameter ; @xmath17 is the radial distance from the center of the spherical corona ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are its inner and outer radii respectively .",
    "kht considered @xmath20 to be an arbitrary parameter , however , as indicated in that reference , the value of @xmath21 allows for scattering of the photons with equal probability over the entire extent of the corona introducing time lags at every available frequency with equal probability , a fact which is in agreement with the observations ; hence they considered the value @xmath21 as the fiducial value of this parameter .",
    "however , they also considered different values of @xmath20 , in particular the value @xmath22 , as it corresponds to the density profiles of the currently popular advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the time response of the given corona , i.e. the flux of photons escaping at a given energy range as a function of time , following the injection of a @xmath23-function of soft photons at its center at @xmath24 has been computed using the monte carlo code of hua ( 1997 ) . as discussed in kht and in hkc its form , @xmath25 , ignoring its rising part , can be approximated by a gamma distribution function , i.e. a function of the form @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the time ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters determining the shape of the light curves which depend on the scattering depth @xmath30 and photon escape energy ( see figures 1a & 1b in kht ) . as indicated in kht , for small values of the total depth of the corona @xmath31 , @xmath32 , while as @xmath30 increases the power law part of the curve becomes progressively flatter , i.e. @xmath33 . for the cloud with @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath34 is small compared to 1 and @xmath35 , determined by the outer edge of the scattering cloud , is taken to be of the order of 1 second so that the light curves have exponential cutoff at @xmath36 second . for uniform cloud , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the light curve is a pure exponential ( leading to a psd proportional to @xmath39 ) ; one should note though that the precise value of @xmath34 depends also on the photon energy ) .",
    "the simplified form of the response function given by equation ( 1 ) allows one to compute analytically its fourier transform ( hkc ) @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the gamma function ; @xmath42 is the fourier frequency and @xmath43 is the phase angle and @xmath44    however , the form of the realistic response functions is more complicated .",
    "figure 1 shows the shape of the response function as computed using the monte carlo code ( hua 1997 ) .",
    "the parameters used in the monte carlo calculation were , @xmath45 light sec @xmath46 cm , @xmath47 light sec@xmath48 cm , the electron temperature was taken to be @xmath49 kev , the thomson depth @xmath50 and the density at bottom of the corona @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "the soft photons were chosen randomly from a planck distribution of temperature 1 kev and the data give the flux of comptonized photons in the @xmath53 kev energy range .    to simulate the precise form of the shots in the coronae we consider we use a more complex function @xmath54    where @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 are given in terms of the arbitrary normalization @xmath57 and the form parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 by the requirement that the function @xmath25 and its first derivative be continuous at @xmath60 , with that point being also a local maximum .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 have the same meaning as those used in eq .",
    "( 2 ) above , while @xmath62 and @xmath63 indicate the time at which the response function achieves its maximum value ( of order @xmath64 ) and the rate at which this maximum is achieved .",
    "the cut - off form of @xmath25 is steeper than exponential to mimic the detailed curve produced by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "one should note the additional parameter @xmath59 , which regulates the  sharpness \" of the transition from the rising to the falling part of the model response function .",
    "the values of the parameters used in fitting the response function were @xmath65 , @xmath66 sec , @xmath67 sec , @xmath68 .",
    "in the same figure we also present the psd which corresponds to a single shot with this specific form of the response function . as will be argued in the next section , under certain assumptions ,",
    "this is also the psd of the entire light curve .",
    "the particular light curve and the associated values of the corresponding fits should be considered only as fiducial values .",
    "monte carlo runs with smaller values of @xmath18 gave shots achieving their peak flux at times scales proportionally shorter .",
    "thus fits of corona response functions with @xmath69 light sec @xmath70 cm and @xmath71 @xmath52 , gave rise times of order @xmath72 sec .",
    "as will be discussed in the next section , the psds of the model x - ray light curves of accreting neutron stars and bhc sources which we present , to a large extent , reflect the properties of the response functions of the corresponding coronae ; we therefore feel that a short discussion of their form is , at this point , necessary . to begin with",
    ", we note that in the limit of infinitely sharp turn - on of the shots under consideration , the fourier transform of @xmath25 is given by @xmath73 of equation ( 2 ) and therefore the psd , under these conditions , can be computed analytically ( hkc ) @xmath74    as discussed in kht , these psds consist of a power law section with slope which is related to the corresponding slope of the power law segment of the response function while flattening to white noise for @xmath75 .",
    "since we have adopted the value @xmath76 in the form of the response function , the psd consists mainly of a power law segment of slope @xmath77 , i.e. flicker noise , representative of the power law segment of the time response function .",
    "however , for the case of more realistic shots which have a finite rise time , such as those shown in fig .",
    "1 , the computation of the psd can no longer be done analytically .",
    "moreover , the finite size of the shot rise time introduces additional structure in the psd which manifests as a break in its high frequency portion . in figure 1",
    "we present , in addition to the profiles of the response functions , the corresponding psds ( short - dashed lines ) .",
    "it is of interest to compare the shape of the psd to those associated with the real data of the bhc cyg x-1 , gx 339 - 4 and nova muscae ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 , fig .",
    "1 ) . one can see that , in addition to the flicker noise behavior , our model also produces the steepening observed at higher frequencies ( see also cui et al .",
    "1997 for rxte data of cyg x-1 and grove et al .",
    "1998 for osse data of gro j0422 + 32 ) .",
    "the similarity of the model psd shapes to the data notwithstanding , the most important feature of the present model is , in our view , the physical association between the specific psd features and the physical characteristics of the hot electron corona responsible for the production of the high energy radiation through comptonization ( most notably its size and radial density slope , though the latter is only determined unequivocally through the hard lags , hkc ) .",
    "we would like to comment specifically on the effect of the parameter @xmath59 , the shot ",
    "sharpness \" parameter , on the form of the psd ; as one might expect , for values @xmath78 , this parameter can affect significantly the form of the psd , rendering it steeper than expected on the basis of the value of the parameter @xmath34 . however , the realistic light curves produced by the monte carlo simulation of hua ( 1997 ) fit quite well with values of @xmath79 and we have therefore adopted this value for this parameter in the remaining of this work .      given that the present model purports to provide a rather generic account of the variability of accreting sources we feel that , even at this early stage of its development , it should also be able to provide a generic account of the features occasionally occuring in the psds of these sources , known as quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "these features have attracted the attention of both theorists and observers , because it was considered that their quasiperiodic nature would lead to clues about the dynamics of accretion onto the compact object not available in their largely aperiodic light curves .    since",
    "our present goal is not the study of the subject of qpo , we forgo any discussion , references or models associated with this subject matter with the exception of the reviews by van der klis ( 1995 , 1998 ) , wherein the interested reader can find more about the qpo phenomenology , systematics and additional references .",
    "however , we would like to demonstrate that the tenet of our model - namely that features of psd correspond to features in the electron density of the hot corona - can indeed provide an account of the qpo phenomenon and some of its systematics .    in fig .",
    "we present the response function of the following configuration : two concentric , uniform shells , each of @xmath80 kev , one extending from @xmath81 to @xmath82 light second , while the second from @xmath83 light seconds to @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "soft photons of energy 0.1 kev are released at the center , @xmath81 , of the configuration .",
    "each panel of fig .",
    "2a corresponds to the response function for photon in the energy range denoted in the figure .",
    "one can distinguish a cut - off at @xmath86 sec , indicative of the exponential drop - off of the photons escaping from the inner shell and a second one at @xmath87 sec due to escape through the outer thin shell .",
    "one should also note the presence of an additional peak at @xmath88 sec , corresponding to photons which were reflected by the outer shell ( rather than transmitted through it ) , escaping at the opposite side of the configuration .",
    "it is our contention that it is the presence of these photons which is responsible for at least some of the aspects of the qpo phenomenon .    in fig .",
    "2b we exhibit the power spectra corresponding to the shots given in fig .",
    "2a . there is an apparent qpo peak at @xmath89 sec as well as harmonically spaced peaks , indicative of the power associated with the time scale @xmath90 , corresponding to the light crossing time of the outer shell .",
    "this additional power in the psd is thus related to the spacial rather than timing properties of an otherwise stationary configuration with generally stochastic soft photon injection .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the qpo contribution increases with photon energy , a fact also in agreement with observation .",
    "this model provides a straightforward account of this effect : the larger the photon energy , the greater the number of scatterings it has undergone and therefore the greater the probability that is has crossed the outer shell , thereby increasing the qpo contribution to the psd .",
    "we view this dependence of the qpo fractional power on the photon energy as an interesting interplay between the spectral and timing properties which the present model can easily accommodate within its general framework .",
    "the presence of multiple qpos in the psd of accreting sources implies therefore , within our model , the presence of multiple shells similar to that responsible for the psd of figure 2 .",
    "we do not know at this point the dynamics which would lead to the presence of such features ; the purpose of the present note is to simply indicate that their presence can lead to qpo - like features similar to those observed .",
    "furhtermore , while features in the spacial electron distribution can indeed produce qpos , one should be cautioned that they are not necessarily the sole cause of all qpo features , and that more conventional models may be actually responsible for a number of them .",
    "we are in the process of studying these possibilities in greater depth ( kazanas & hua in preparation ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , it is our opinion that one of the major obstacles in understanding the dynamics of accretion onto compact objects is the difficulty in providing concrete models of their observed time variability which could be easily compared to observation ; in our view , this lack of models is largely due to to the aperiodic character of their light curves , which offers few clues on the mechanism responsible for their formation .",
    "it is our contention that the light curves associated with the high energy emission of accreting compact sources is due , to a large extent , to the stochastic nature of compton scattering in an optically thin , hot , extended medium , which is responsible for the formation of their spectra , coupled with a ( probably ) stochastic injection of soft photons to be comptonized .",
    "our proposal , therefore , is that the observed light curves consist of the incoherent superposition of elementary events , each triggered by the injection of a soft photon pulse into the extended corona of hot electrons discussed above . to simplify matters",
    ", we assume that the soft photon injection takes place at the center of the corona and it is of vanishing duration ; therefore the resulting high energy light curve should be the incoherent sum of pulses with shapes given by the corresponding response function discussed in the previous section .    following this prescription",
    ", one can easily produce model light curves of the resulting high energy emission .",
    "these will have the form @xmath91    the variable @xmath92 in the above equation is a random variable indicating the injection times of the individual shots , while @xmath93 is their normalization , a quantity which in our specific model depends on the number of soft photons injected at each particular shot event .",
    "clearly , one could in principle arrange for any form of the psd by choosing the values of the parameters @xmath94 from appropriately defined distributions .",
    "while the values of @xmath93 and @xmath92 may in fact be associated with certain distributions , we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of such distributions and they are in no way restricted by any compelling dynamical arguments .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid introducing extraneous information into our time series , we have chosen a constant value for all @xmath93 s , while the values of @xmath92 s are chosen to be poisson distributed with a given constant rate .",
    "as such , the @xmath92 s are chosen using the relation @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 and @xmath97 a real number , indicating the mean time between shots in terms of their rise time @xmath62 .    in figures 3a and 3b we present two such model light curves .",
    "the parameters of the shots used in constructing these curves were the same as those fitting the response function of figure 2a .",
    "the two figures are different in the value of the parameter @xmath97 i.e. the parameter which indicates the mean arrival time between shots . the value of @xmath97 was set to @xmath98 in figure 3a and @xmath99 in figure 3b .",
    "the two curves were produced with exactly the same sequence of random numbers , a fact which can be discerned by identifying corresponding features in the two light curves .",
    "the random character of the parameter @xmath92 leads then to an apparently incoherent light curve in the sense discussed by krolik , done & madejski ( 1993 ) , i.e. of random absolute phases as a function of the fourier frequency .    in figures 4a and 4b we present  zoom - in \" sections of the light curves of figs 3a , 3b , corresponding to the same ordinal in the sequence of random shots .",
    "the shape of the shots becomes progressively asymmetric as the value of @xmath97 increases , since that gives time to the contribution of an individual shot to the light curve to decrease substantially before the next one appears , thus manifesting the underlying asymmetry of the individual shots . at the same time",
    ", this also leads to an increase in the rms amplitude of the variability .",
    "one should note that the model light curves presented in these figures consist exclusively of the superposition of shots which die out like power laws rather than exponentially in time , without the presence of a d.c .",
    "the brief rising part of the light curve lasts for a time interval of @xmath100 seconds , i.e. for the time it takes the earliest shot to die out , and it is a transient associated with the turn - on process . beyond this point a steady  state of",
    "rather well defined mean is established , which however is not particularly smooth but characterized by large , aperiodic oscillations , the result of the random arrival and superposition of shots of shapes similar to those of fig . 1 .",
    "it is apparent from the above that an rms value for the light curve can be established only for time scales @xmath101 .",
    "we thus propose that observations in which the rms values of the corresponding light curves depend on the observation interval indicate that these light curves have not been sampled for sufficiently long intervals i.e. @xmath102 , even if the accretion rate has remained constant during this interval .",
    "conversely , the sampling time over which a well defined rms value of the light curve can be established , could be used to estimate of the time scale @xmath35 and thus the size of the high energy emitting source .",
    "this size could then be compared to that obtained through study of the lags ( see hkc ) for consistency .",
    "the present model allows for several different ways of implementing a change in the rms amplitude of the model light curves .",
    "these are , in principle , related to observables and could be lead to provide novel insights concering the variability and dynamics of accreting sources .",
    "the simple prescription for generating the light curves given above indicates clearly that increasing the value of @xmath97 , i.e. the mean time between shots in units of their rise time , would result in larger rms fluctuations of the light curves , should the rest attributes of the response function remain the same .",
    "this particular case is discussed in more detail in  5.2 as it is expected to be correlated to the skewness of the light curves .    in this section",
    "we discuss the additional possibility of changes in the rms fluctuations of the light curves effected by changes in the value of the rise time of the shots @xmath62 .",
    "for example , decreasing @xmath62 while keeping the other parameters ( size , temperature , density ) of the hot corona constant , would lead to an increase in the source luminosity and a corresponding decrease in the rms fluctuation amplitude without any additional changes in the spectral or temporal properties of the source .",
    "however , if the time scales @xmath62 and @xmath35 are indeed related to a length scale associated with the size of the corona s inner and outer edges , this would generally depend on the macroscopic parameters associated with the accretion flow , most notably the accretion rate . to illustrate with an example the insights which can be gained by comparing such simple models to observation , we assume that the inner and outer radii of the corona @xmath103 ( and for that matter the entire flow within the corona ) , scale proportionally to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the free - fall velocity and @xmath106 the local cooling time scale . assuming the latter to be inversely proportional to the local density , a prescription in accordance with , say",
    ", the models of adaf of narayan & yi ( 1994 ) , then all the length scales of the corona , expressed in schwarzschild radii , should be inversely proportional to the accretion rate of the flow , measured in units of its eddington value .",
    "therefore , an increase in @xmath107 would lead not only to a decrease in @xmath62 and therefore in the rms amplitude of fluctuations , but also in a concommitant decrease of all other lengths of the system ( e.g. its outer edge ) , resulting to an increase in the psd frequencies corresponding to these features ( e.g. the psd low frequency break ) .",
    "apparently such correlations between the source luminosity and the timing characteristics , while they may not be a universal phenomenon , have been observed in at least several sources .",
    "for example , van der hooft et al . ( 1996 ) indicate that an increase in the luminostity of the black hole candidate gro j1719 - 24 leads to an increase in the qpo frequency at 0.04 hz by a factor of @xmath108 while at the same time the rms amplitude decreases by exactly the same amount preserving total variability power in the sense that the product @xmath109 remains constant .",
    "these authors indicate that scaling down all the frequencies of the psd obtained when the source was in it high state , leads to a psd indistinguishable from that obtained when this source had a much lower luminosity .",
    "similar general trends have also been observed in the transient source gro j0422 + 32 ( grove et al . 1998 ) and are indicative that this behavior does not represent an isolated phenomenon associated with a particular source . at the same time , the simple example discussed above indicates how modeling the aperiodic variability of these sources could lead to new insights and probes of the dynamics of accretion onto compact objects .",
    "concerning the morphology of the light curves given in figs .",
    "3a and 3b , eye inspection reveals shots with a variety of time scales , and indeed we believe that a distribution of such shots can be found , should one care to view and model them as such ( see e.g. focke & swank 1998 ) .",
    "however , none of these additional time scales or shots have been used as input in this particular simulation .",
    "they result simply from the superposition of a large number of shots with power law tails which extend to @xmath36 second . zooming - in to the highest time resolution",
    ", one can indeed discern shots with rise times of the order of @xmath110 sec in agreement with observations ( meekins et al .",
    "these shots are indeed the individual elementary events ( with the power - law extended tails ) which comprise our model light curves . however , given the rather limited time range over which one can distinguish the contribution of such individual shots over the flux produced by the incoherent sum of their ensemble ( or the detector statistics ) , one would most likely attempt to fit their shape with an exponential rather than a power law , because their long , extended tails can not be discerned in the data . however , while fits in the time domain fail to uncover the true structure of these shots because of their crowding , the psd can achieve this very easily and reliably .",
    "the above analysis makes clear that our model for the variability of accreting sources stands in stark contrast to other models put forth to date to account for the  flicker noise \" character of the observed variability of bhc ( chen & taam 1995 ; takeuchi , mineshige & negoro 1995 ) : rather than attributing the observed psd characteristics entirely to variations in the mass flux onto the compact object , it attributes them , for the most part , to the spacial distribution of electrons in the comptonizing cloud and the stochastic nature of compton scattering .",
    "the accretion rate is no doubt variable , especially at the shortest intervals - smallest radii ( e.g. the soft photon injection events ) , however its variability is consistent with a constant  averaged - out \" accretion rate on longer time scales , as indicated by the coherence measurements and their interpretation ( hkt ) . more importantly , this analysis provides a direct association between the physical properties of the scattering",
    " corona \" and specific features of the psd , in particular its low and high frequency breaks .",
    "since the scattering properties of the extended corona ( i.e. @xmath111 ) affect both the spectral and the temporal properties of the emitted radiation in well defined fashion , this model implies the presence of certain well defined spectro - temporal correlations and provides the motivation to search for and model them in detail . because such correlations will have to be related eventually to the dynamics of accretion",
    ", they could serve as a means for probing these dynamics along the lines of the simple example given above .",
    "finally , the apparently random character of the observed light curves ( lochner et al . 1991 ) is attributed to the  random \" ( poisson ) injection of soft photons and the stochastic nature of the comptonization process .",
    "the fact that the variability associated with the light curves of figure 3 is due in part to compton scattering , rather than , for instance , the modulation of the accretion rate , affords an additional probe of the properties of scattering medium , namely the study of time or phase lags in the light curves of two different energy bands as a function of the fourier frequency .",
    "this particular issue has already been discussed in kht , hkt and in greater detail in hkc .",
    "it bears on the fact that time lags between photons of different energies depend on the scattering time of the plasma within which the compton scattering takes place . in a corona with a density profile given by equation ( 1 )",
    ", there is a linear relation between the scattering time and the crossing time of a given decade in radius , while in addition , the probability of scattering within a given ( logarithmic ) range in radius is constant ( for @xmath21 ) .",
    "consider now the light curves in two different energy bands : the escaping photons in the higher of two energy bands suffer , on average , a larger number of scatterings , which , for @xmath21 , take place with equal probability at all radii ; the information about the radii at which the additional scatterings took place is imprinted in the fourier structure of these time lags .",
    "the linearity between the scattering and the crossing times then suggests that the lags grow proportionally to the fourier period @xmath7 .",
    "we have repeated the lag analysis outlined in the previous references , this time with model light curves appropriate for two different energies , generated artificially using the algorithm described in the previous section .",
    "these were generated by sums of shots as demanded by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , with the function @xmath25 in each sum being the response function corresponding to a given photon energy .",
    "as noted in kht , the very fact that higher energies require longer residence times of the photons in the scattering cloud , leads to small but significant ( from the point of view of the lags ; see hkc ) differences in their corresponding response functions .",
    "in particular , the power law part of the response function is slightly flatter ( larger @xmath34 ) and extends to slightly larger times ( larger @xmath35 ) .",
    "while eye inspection can not discern any difference in the shape of the light curves corresponding to the two different energies , they are easily manifest in the fourier decomposition of the time lags . as pointed out in hkc these differences in the individual shot profiles suffice to produce lags in general agreement with observation .",
    "figure 5 presents the phase lags of our model light curves as a function of the fourier frequency .",
    "its magnitude and fourier frequency dependence is very similar to those corresponding to galactic bhc analyzed by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and to that of the x - ray transient source gro j0422 + 32 ( grove et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the corresponding time lags of the light curves so generated are obtained by simply dividing the phase lags by the fourier frequency .",
    "the fact that the phase lags are almost constant over the entire range in fourier frequency of figure 4 suggests that the corresponding time lags will be roughly proportional to the fourier period @xmath7 , as discussed in hkc .",
    "one could apply the arguments presented in the previous section on the dependence of the psd shape and features to infer the dependence of the lags on the accretion rate ; the contraction of all scales associated with the corona argued there should also reflect to a decrease of the corresponding lags with increasing accretion rate . as indicated by cui et al .",
    "( 1997 ) such a dependence has been observed in cyg x-1 providing further evidence in favor of this specific model .",
    "in addition to the information provided by the power spectral densities ( psd ) and the phase or time lags discussed above , insights into the nature of variability of the bhc sources can also be obtained from moments of the light curves in the time rather than the frequency domain .",
    "these have been used in the analysis of the light curves of accreting compact objects several times in the past ( lochner et al 1991 ) . since we are able to produce models of these light curves we feel that it is instructive to compute the corresponding statistics associated with them so that one could directly compare them to those associated with the light curves obtained from observation . at present",
    "we will pay particular attention to two such statistics , the autocorrelation function and the time skewness of the light curves .",
    "this statistic provides a measure of the dependence of the flux ( counting rate ) , @xmath112 , of the source at a given time @xmath27 on its flux , @xmath113 , at a prior time . assuming that the source variability consists of flares of a particular time scale , the autocorrelation function provides a measure of this time scale . while the information contained in the autocorrelation function is related to that of the psd through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , since this statistic is also used to gauge the variability of accreting sources , for purposes of comparison , it is instructive to provide its form for the model light curves we produce in conjunction with the psd .    given that our model light curves are the incoherent sum of a large number of shots of the form given by eq.(4 ) , in order to exhibit directly the effect of the random injection of shots used to produce the light curve , we have chosen to compute the autocorrelation function in two ways : ( a ) through the convolution of the response function @xmath25 with itself , i.e. @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the associated time lag .",
    "( b ) directly from the model light curves produced by the procedure described above .",
    "considering that the light curve consists of measurements of the flux @xmath116 at @xmath117 points in time , denoted as @xmath118 , separated in time by an interval @xmath119 , the autocorrelation function at a given lag , @xmath120 , is given by the sum ( ignoring normalization factors ) @xmath121 [ f(t_i+ u\\cdot \\delta\\tau ) - \\bar f ]      \\eqno(8)\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the mean value of the flux over the interval we consider .",
    "the results of these two procedures are shown in figures 5a , 5b .",
    "as it can be seen , the autocorrelation function computed by these two procedures are consistent with each other , with the fluctuations at the largest lags of fig .",
    "5b due to the statistical nature of our light curve .",
    "this latter one is also very similar to that computed from the cyg x-1 light curve by meekins et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and lochner et al .",
    "the similarity of the autocorrelation function of that obtained from the observations further corroborates the model we have just presented .    at this point",
    "we would like to note that , usually , the data associated with the autocorrelation function are presented , ( e.g. meekins et al . 1994 ; lochner et al .",
    "1991 ) , in linear time coordinate ; we believe that this presentation masks most of the interesting physics which are contained in the interval near zero .",
    "it is our contention that in the study of systems whose variability apparently spans several decades in frequency , like the accreting compact objects considered in the present note , the use of logarithmic rather than linear coordinates is instrumental ; it is only in terms of former that one can capture the entire range of the physical processes involved .",
    "the form of the autocorrelation functions corresponding to those of figs .",
    "5a , 5b in logarithmic time coordinate are given in figs .",
    "5c , 5d .",
    "this statistic measures the time asymmetry of a given light curve , i.e. whether the latter is composed of pulses having sharper rise than decay or vice versa .",
    "because the autocorrelation function is symmetric in the lag variable @xmath115 , it can not give any such information about the shape of the light curve .",
    "this property can be assessed by computing moments of the light curve higher than the second . in particular , the third moment , @xmath123 , as defined in priedhorsky et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , provides the proper statistic . for a light curve given as an array of the flux @xmath124 as described in the previous subsection",
    ", the skewness is given by the sum ( ignoring again the normalization factors ) @xmath125[f(t_i+ u\\cdot \\delta \\tau ) - \\bar f][f(t_i ) - f(t_i+ u\\cdot \\delta\\tau ) ]        \\eqno(9)\\ ] ]    given that our model light curves are sums of shots with a unique time profile , one can infer _ a priori _ several properties of the resulting light curves : the form of the shot profile ( eq .",
    "4 ) suggests that , since the shots are asymmetric in time , the corresponding light curves should be also asymmetric , at least in situations in which the contribution of individual shots can be perceived .",
    "however , the presence of the long power ",
    "law tails associated with the individual shots , suggests that over sufficiently long time scales , which encompass a large number of shots , the light curves should be largely symmetric in time .",
    "this argument is born out by both inspection of our model light curves and computation of the skewness parameter .",
    "the prescription for creating model light curves discussed in section 3 , offers the possibility of testing the above arguments by producing light curves with the proper characteristics , through variation of one or more of their control parameters .",
    "the specific parameter in this case is the mean time between shots @xmath97 . in figure 6",
    "we present the skewness function of light curves corresponding to two different values of this parameter , namely @xmath126 .",
    "as expected , for the small values of this parameter the light curves are indeed symmetric as it can be assessed both by inspection and the value of skewness . for @xmath127 the light curves become distinctly asymmetric out to time lags roughly @xmath128 , beyond which they appear again symmetric due to the superposition of a large number of shots .",
    "this specific property then offers itself to observational testing : one should note that large values of @xmath97 lead not only to non - zero short time skewness , but also to large rms fluctuations of the light curve as alluded in  3 ; in fact , the larger the @xmath97-value , the larger the corresponding rms fluctuations and also the value of the lag @xmath115 for which the skewness , @xmath129 , of the light curve deviates from a non - zero value . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such a correlation has never been proposed or sought in the data .",
    "it would be of interest to see to what extent it is born by observations .",
    "we have presented above a general prescription for producing model light curves of accreting compact objects . within our model ,",
    "the observed _ aperiodic _ variability of these light curves is due to the stochastic nature of the comptonization process in conjunction with the soft photon injection near the compact object by a poisson process .",
    "our prescription thus accounts naturally for the apparent lack of coherence in the absolute phase of the observed light curves and the apparent high coherence in the relative phase of the light curves of two different energy bands , since both the hard and soft shots have the same origin in the impulsive injection of the soft photons .",
    "concerning the most common test of variability , namely the psd , our model relates it to spacial rather than timing properties of these systems , in particular to the spacial distribution of electrons in the comptonizing hot corona .",
    "thus it produces psds in agreement with observation and provides a novel framework within which one can easily accommodate the existence of qpos and some of their systematics and dependence on the sources luminosity . within the present framework for the variability of accreting sources , their timing and spectral properties",
    "are intimately related in a way that could allow one to probe of the dynamics of accretion onto the compact object through the use a combined spectro - temporal analysis .",
    "finally , the model light curves produced using the prescription indicated above have a morphology is in general agreement with the observed _ aperiodic _ variability of this class of sources .",
    "the morphology of the light curves has been examined by computation of two statistical properties in the time domain , namely the autocorrelation function and the time skewness .",
    "these , as computed for our model light curves , appear to be in good agreement with their ( albeit limited ) published literature forms corresponding to the light curves of the bhc cyg x-1 . considering the simplicity of our models ( a single type of shot , poisson distribution in injection times ) , we are quite surprised that they work as well as they do .",
    "our investigation points , in addition , to a correlation between the rms variability and the skewness of the corresponding light curves , which we feel should be tested against the observations .",
    "the models presented herein draw heavily on the ideas presented in kht , hkt and hkc , namely of very extended ( @xmath130 ) hot electron coronae with power law dependence of the electron density in radius .",
    "in our view , the importance of these models lies in the implied direct association between features in the observed psds and time lags ( i.e. features of their fourier domain characteristics ) with features in the spacial domain ( i.e size , radial density structure ) .",
    "such an association is not dictated in any of the , albeit very few , alternative models of bhc variability , and to the best of our knowledge , neither has been proposed before in the literature .",
    "it is of interest that both the sources sizes and density structures , as deduced from our models ( see also kht , hkt , hua et al .",
    "1997 ) , are incommensurate with those predicted by the most popular models .",
    "these models generally require the sources size to be only a few r@xmath131 ( shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) , leading to very narrow range in density ( which in the present framework can be considered uniform ) and therefore to an equally narrow range in time lags , in disagreement with observation .",
    "the recent , popular adaf ( narayan & yi 1994 ) are indeed extended in radius , as demanded by our models , but their density profiles are proportional to @xmath132 , rather than the @xmath133 profiles preferred by our fits to most ( but not all ) of the time lag observations obtained to date ( hkc ) , suggesting that a variant of these models maybe more appropriate in describing the dynamics of accretion in these sources .",
    "it is nonetheless important to point out that both of these density profiles have been associated with data from the same source ( cyg x-1 ) , at different viewing periods , indicating that , according to the present model , the structure of a given source can vary drastically as a function of time .",
    "we believe that the present model is sufficiently well defined and makes concrete enough predictions to allow its falsification or confirmation by more detailed observations . as such",
    ", we expect observations in the time domain to be of vital importance .",
    "because the timing and spectral properties are intimately related within our model , testing the particular paradigm would most likely involve a combination of spectral and temporal correlations .",
    "we have provided fits of our models to a small set of observations , and derived the corresponding physical parameters of the scattering coronae for these systems ; these indicate a great departure from our previous notions as to what they should be .",
    "we do not know as yet how to justify the values of the parameters obtained by our models , however this is not the purpose of the present paper .",
    "we simply hope that these models will stimulate additional observational scrutiny and re - analysis of the data within their framework , leading possibly to novel insights which will further our understanding of the dynamics of accretion onto the compact object .",
    "last but not least , these models will have to be modified to incorporate additional spectral features such as the reflection features and the fe lines , which the more conventinal models of thin , cold disks and their associated hot coronae have addressed so far with significant success .",
