    "lattice gas systems have been known to show some nontrivial phenomena , such as the appearance of long - range spatial correlations@xcite and anomalous drift motions@xcite , even if the system involves only two particles .    in our system ,",

    "next , we explain the mechanism of these phenomena by considering the transition diagrams .",
    "last , we show the similarities between our obtained results and those observed in the polymer solutions or colloidal suspensions .",
    "now , we introduce a lattice gas model , which is the same as that studied in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "we consider a lattice system with two parallel one - dimensional lanes where each lane involves @xmath1 sites with a periodic boundary .",
    "each lane contains only one particle which moves randomly to the nearest sites without changing lanes .",
    "the sites occupied by particles in the @xmath2st and @xmath3nd lanes are denoted @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , which are given as integer numbers from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of potential forces acting on the particles is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the one - body potential on each lane , and @xmath10 represents the interaction potential between the two particles .",

    "thus , the particle - particle interactions play important roles to show the presented non - trivial behaviors like those observed shear - thickening solutions .",
    "in this section , we try to explain the mechanism of our obtained phenomena by considering the transition diagrams .. first , we name all states of this system using the sites occupied by the particles in each lane @xmath62 . since @xmath29 , this system has 16 states from @xmath63 to @xmath64 . the transitional tendency from @xmath62 to @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 , which was defined previously . here",

    ", @xmath75 indicates the state @xmath62 , the arrows give the direction of the transition with a probability higher than @xmath76 implying @xmath77 , and the values beside these arrows indicate the value of @xmath78 .",
    "the motion of the system is represented by the random walk caused by the fluctuation with @xmath22 in the transition diagram . here , the transition in a vertical direction indicates the motion of the particle in the @xmath2st lane , and that in a horizontal direction indicates the motion of the driven particle in the @xmath3nd lane .    as shown in figs .",
    "4 , there exist two types of states , the transient state , which has some arrows directing to some other states , and the attractor , which has no arrows directing to any other states .",
    "if @xmath22 is small enough compared to @xmath36 and @xmath51 , the transitions from each state are considered to conform to the following tendencies in most cases .",
    "1 ) from the transient states , one of all transitions with the arrows directing to any other of the states is realized randomly .",
    "2 ) from the attractors , only a transition in the direction with the smallest @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is realized with the probability @xmath80 ( escape rate ) . it is noted that the system tends to stay the attractors for most of the time .",
    "thus , the escape rate from these attractors contributes dominantly to give the mean velocity of the driven particle @xmath32 .",
    "now , we focus on the typical trajectories in the transition diagrams for the cases with @xmath52 ( figs .",
    "4 ) to explain the appearance of the @xmath44 relations like in fig .",
    "when @xmath70 , the transition diagram as given in fig .",
    "4(a ) involves the following trajectory as a typical one characterizing the steady state motion , @xmath81 .",
    "( as indicated by thin arrows ) .",
    "this trajectory indicates the motions in which both particles proceed in the direction of @xmath11 . here",
    ", this involves four attractors , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the escape rates from the attractors @xmath82 or @xmath83 given through the transitions @xmath86 or @xmath87 increase with the increase in @xmath11 .",
    "however , those of @xmath84 or @xmath85 given through the transitions @xmath88 or @xmath89 are independent of @xmath11 .",
    "then , @xmath32 can not increase so fast with @xmath11 in this case .",
    "in the case where @xmath90 , the typical trajectories giving the steady state motions still involve the attractors @xmath84 and @xmath85 as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) ( as indicated by thin arrows ) . also in this case , the escape rates from these attractors are still independent of @xmath11 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath32 increases little with @xmath11 .    in the case where @xmath91 , the following two types of typical trajectories appear , as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) , i ) trajectories including two attractors , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , for example @xmath92 ( as indicated by thin arrows ) , and ii ) trajectories including only one attractor @xmath84 for example @xmath93 ( as indicated by broken arrows ) . here",
    ", the former trajectory indicates the motions in which both particles proceed in the direction of @xmath11 while the latter indicates the motions in which only the driven particle proceeds . in this case , the escape rate from @xmath84 given through the transition @xmath94 increases exponentially with the increase in @xmath11 while the escape rate @xmath85 given through the transition @xmath89 is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "then , the mean velocity of the driven particle remains unaffected by the increase in @xmath11 if the system develops along trajectories i ) . on the other hand , this increases exponentially with @xmath11 if the system develops along trajectories ii ) .",
    "thus , within this range of @xmath11 , @xmath32 increases steeply with @xmath11 on the average .    in the case where @xmath95 , similar to the previous case , the following two types of trajectories are still typical ones as shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) , i ) trajectories including two states , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( as indicated by thin arrows ) , and ii ) trajectories including a state @xmath84 , but not including a state @xmath85 ( as indicated by broken arrows ) . however , the state @xmath84 is no longer the attractor although @xmath85 is still an attractor .",
    "then , the diagram includes trajectories involving an attractor @xmath85 and those involving no attractors . in the former trajectories ,",
    "the escape rate from @xmath85 is still independent of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 increases slightly with @xmath11 .    in the case where @xmath96 , the escape rate from the attractor @xmath85 becomes one increasing exponentially with @xmath11 , which is given through the transition @xmath97 as in fig .",
    "then , the mean velocity of the driven particle along trajectories including the attractor @xmath85 ( as indicated by thin arrows ) increases exponentially with @xmath11 , although that along any trajectories without the attractor @xmath85 ( as indicated by broken arrows ) are unaffected by @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , within this range of @xmath11 , @xmath32 increases steeply with @xmath11 .",
    "thus , for @xmath52 , @xmath32 increases slowly @xmath0",
    "steeply @xmath0 slowly @xmath0 steeply with the increase in @xmath11 .",
    "this result is consistent to the @xmath98 relations in fig .",
    "2(a ) .    in cases with @xmath53 or @xmath54 , the manner of the @xmath11 dependent changes of the transition diagrams",
    "proceed differently from the previous case .",
    "( we do not show the diagrams for such @xmath51 in order to avoid the complications . )",
    "we can also explain the mechanism of the phenomena observed in each range of @xmath51 via the same analytic method .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the transport phenomena of a simple nonequilibrium lattice gas system .",
    "we measure the mean velocity of the driven particle ( @xmath32 ) and the coefficient of effective drag of this particle ( @xmath45 ) . under the certain ranges of parameters",
    ", we obtained the @xmath32 - @xmath45 relations qualitatively similar to the relations which observed between the shear rate and shear viscosity coefficient in the shear - thickening polymer solutions@xcite or that of the shear - thickening colloidal suspensions@xcite .",
    "the mechanisms of these phenomena are explained by the transition diagram .",
    "now , we consider the similarities between our results and those obtained recent studies for the rheology of soft matter systems in a little more detail .",

    "such a profile was also obtained in the @xmath50 relation in our simulation under the other certain conditions ( for the case ii - ii or iii in the phase diagram fig .",
    "3(d ) ) .    moreover , among results of recent studies , the power law [ shear viscosity coefficient ] @xmath99 [ shear rate]@xmath100 has been observed in the shear - thinning regime . here , @xmath101 has been given in some experimental studies , simulations and theoretical studies@xcite while @xmath102 that varies depending on several conditions between @xmath6 and @xmath2 has been obtained in the other experimental and theoretical studies@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we obtained the following @xmath50 relations in the @xmath45 decreasing regime for lower @xmath22 ; @xmath103 for smaller @xmath32 and @xmath104 for larger @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we expect our results to provide important hints to uncover the possible mechanism for several rheological characteristics of several soft materials . however , the relations of some properties , for example the exponents of the transport coefficients , the transport properties in cases with lower temperature , etc . are still unclear between our results and those obtained in several recent studies .",
