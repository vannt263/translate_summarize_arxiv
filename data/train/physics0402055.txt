    "electron acoustic waves ( eaws ) are high - frequency ( in comparison with the ion plasma frequency ) electrostatic modes @xcite in plasmas where a ` minority ' of inertial cold electrons oscillate against a dominant thermalized background of inertialess hot electrons providing the necessary restoring force .",
    "the phase speed @xmath1 of the eaw is much larger than the thermal speeds of cold electrons ( @xmath2 ) and ions ( @xmath3 ) , but is much smaller than the thermal speed of the hot electron component ( @xmath4 ) ; @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 denotes the mass of the component @xmath8 ; the boltzmann constant @xmath9 is understood to precede the temperature @xmath10 everywhere ) . thus , the ions may be regarded as a constant positive charge density background , providing charge neutrality .",
    "the eaw frequency is typically well below the cold electron plasma frequency , since the wavelength is larger than the debye length @xmath11 involving hot electrons ( @xmath12 denotes the particle density of the component @xmath8 everywhere ) .",
    "the linear properties of the ea waves are well understood [ 25 ] .",
    "of particular importance is the fact that the eaw propagation is only possible within a restricted range of the parameter values , since both long and short wavelength eaws are subject to strong landau damping due to resonance with either the hot or the cold ( respectively ) electron component . in general , the eaw group velocity scales as @xmath13 ; therefore , the condition @xmath14 immediately leads to a stability criterion in the form : @xmath15 . a more rigorous investigation [ 4 ]",
    "reveals that eaws will be heavily damped , unless the following ( approximate ) conditions are satisfied : @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) .",
    "even then , however , only wavenumbers @xmath19 between , roughly , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 ; see in ref .",
    "4b ) , will remain weakly damped [ @xmath23 obviously denotes the cold electron debye wavenumber ] .",
    "the stable wavenumber value range is in principle somewhat extended with growing temperature ratio @xmath24 ; see the exhaustive discussion in refs . 4 and 5 .",
    "as far as the _ nonlinear _ aspects of eaw are concerned , the formation of coherent ea structures has been considered in a one - dimensional model involving cold @xcite or finite temperature @xcite ions .",
    "furthermore , such non - envelope solitary structures , associated with a localized compression of the cold electron density , have been shown to exist in a magnetized plasma [ 9  11 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that such studies are recently encouraged by the observation of moving eaw - related structures , reported by spacecraft missions e.g. the fast at the auroral region [ 12  14 ] , as well as the geotail and polar earlier missions in the magnetosphere [ 15  17 ] .",
    "however , although most solitary wave structures observed are positive potential waves ( consistent with an electron hole image ) , there have also been some negative potential and low velocity structure observations , suggesting that some other type of solitary waves may be present in the magnetosphere [ 17 , 18 ] .",
    "these structures are now believed to be related to ea envelope solitary waves , for instance due to trapping and modulation by ion acoustic density perturbations @xcite .",
    "amplitude modulation is a long - known generic feature of nonlinear wave propagation , resulting in higher harmonic generation due to nonlinear self - interactions of the carrier wave in the background medium .",
    "the standard method for studying this mechanism is a multiple space and time scale technique @xcite , which leads to a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) describing the evolution of the wave envelope . under certain conditions , it has been shown that waves may develop a benjamin - feir - type ( modulational ) instability ( mi ) , i.e. their modulated envelope may be unstable to external perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the nlse - based analysis , encountered in a variety of physical systems [ 21  23 ] , reveals the possibility of the existence of localized structures ( envelope solitary waves ) due to the balance between the wave dispersion and nonlinearities .",
    "this approach has long been considered with respect to electrostatic plasma waves [ 20 , 24  30 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we study the occurrence of modulational instability as well as the existence of envelope solitary structures involving eaws that propagate in an unmagnetized plasma composed of three distinct particle populations : a population of ` cold ' inertial electrons ( mass @xmath25 , charge @xmath26 ) , surrounded by an environment of ` hot ' ( thermalized boltzmann ) electrons , moving against a fixed background of ions ( mass @xmath27 , charge @xmath28 ) , which provide charge neutrality .",
    "these three plasma species will henceforth be denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . by employing the reductive perturbation method and accounting for harmonic generation nonlinearities",
    ", we derive a cubic schrdinger equation for the modulated ea wave packet .",
    "it is found that the eaws are unstable against oblique modulations .",
    "conditions under which the modulational instability occurs are given .",
    "possible stationary solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation are also presented .",
    "let us consider the hydrodynamic  poisson system of equations for the eaws in an unmagnetized plasma .",
