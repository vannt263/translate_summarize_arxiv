    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) physics has become increasingly important to condensed matter science in recent decades because many systems , including for example single wall carbon nanotubes @xcite , organic conductors @xcite , superconducting narowires @xcite , spin chains @xcite , and even ultracold atoms in highly anisotropic magneto - optical traps @xcite , have been developed to levels that allow experimental studies of hitherto unprecedented extent and precision . among these 1d ( or quasi-1d ) systems , the semiconductor quantum wire structure ( qwr ) is one of the most important and widely studied , because of its simple band structure and highly tunable doping density @xcite .",
    "also , great progress in micro - fabrication techniques has made high quality samples available @xcite .",
    "theoretically , one dimensional systems are very well understood .",
    "the pioneering work of tomonaga @xcite , luttinger @xcite and haldane @xcite along with many other studies has produced an essentially complete understanding of the low energy physics .",
    "however , the relation between the theoretical results and experimental data is not as clear and direct as one would like .",
    "for example , only a few unambiguous observations of the fundamental concept of spin - charge separation have been reported @xcite .",
    "resonant raman spectroscopy ( rrs ) has become a powerful tool for studying the elementary excitations of electrons in many different systems .",
    "applications to low dimensional doped semiconductor nanostructures ( two - dimensional quantum wells or one - dimensional quantum wires ) have been particularly prominent @xcite . in the usual rrs experiment ,",
    "schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ band](a ) , external photons are absorbed at one frequency and momentum by exciting an electron from the valence band to the conduction band ( step 1 ) and then emitted at another frequency and momentum via the recombination of the hole in the valence band with another electron in the conduction band ( step 2 ) .",
    "the final state of the system contains one or more particle - hole pairs excited in the conduction band .",
    "the dispersion of these particle - hole pair states may be inferred from the energy and momentum difference between the incident and the scattered photons ( stokes shift ) , while the nature ( collective mode ( plasmon ) and multipair excitation ) may be inferred from the dependence of the scattering amplitude on the polarization of the incoming and outgoing photons and on the energy of the incident photon .",
    "the standard theory of raman spectroscopy in semiconductors @xcite , is based on the fermi liquid ( fl ) quasi - particle picture and neglects resonance effects .",
    "the neglect of resonance effects means that in the unpolarized geometry ( identical polarization of incoming and outgoing light ) the raman process couples to the electron density operator so the raman cross section is proportional to the dynamical structure factor @xcite of the conduction band electrons . within fermi liquid theory and in the long wavelength limit relevant to raman scattering ,",
    "the electron structure factor has a delta function peak at the plasmon ( cde ) energy and a much weaker feature at a lower energy associated with incoherent particle - hole pairs .",
    "the lower energy feature is referred to as the single particle excitation ( spe ) peak .",
    "the calculated rrs intensity therefore has strong spectral peaks when the energy difference between the incident and outgoing photons coincides with the collective cde mode frequencies at the wavevector defined by the experimental geometry , while the intensity at the spe energy is much weaker than that at the cde energy ( the ratio is of the order of the square of the ratio of momentum transferred by the light to the fermi momentum of the electron gas ; for typical experimental relevant parameters , about three orders of magnitude ) .",
    "this theoretical result , however , is in qualitative disagreement with the experimental data @xcite , in which the polarized spectrum exhibits a `` double peak '' structure with comparable - intensity peaks at both cde and spe modes .",
    "this puzzling feature @xcite of an ubiquitous strong spe peak in addition to the expected cde peak occurs in one , two , and even in three dimensional doped semiconductor nanostructures , for both intrasubband and intersubband excitations .",
    "many theoretical proposals @xcite have been made to explain this two - peak rrs puzzle .",
    "however , two of us have recently argued @xcite that within the standard theory , which neglects resonance effects , none of the above proposed modified mechanisms theory can even qualitatively explain the experimental data .",
    "but the situation changes when resonance effects are included . in an important paper , sassetti and kramer ( sk )",
    "@xcite first proposed that in 1d systems , the prominent lower energy spe peak is due to `` spinon '' excitations whose coupling to light is enhanced by resonance effects . the qualitative idea",
    "that resonance effects can strongly affect the relative absorption cross - sections of different modes is indeed important .",
    "unfortunately , as we have recently noted , the theory presented in ref .",
    "[ ] suffers from two technical flaws .",
    "first , it is not self - consistent : it uses a fermi - liquid - based expression to account for the resonance effects , but a luttinger - liquid - based expression to account for the conduction band dynamics . as we shall show below ( and",
    "have already mentioned in a previous brief communication @xcite ) luttinger liquid physics affects the matrix element in a crucial way .",
    "second , while the sk calculation correctly notes that as resonance is approached the coupling becomes long ranged in space , it omits the equally important fact that the coupling becomes long ranged also in _",
    "time_.    in this paper , which amplifies and extends our previous short communication @xcite , we derive and present a complete , closed - form expression for the rrs scattering amplitudes in the luttinger liquid model and calculate the resulting rrs spectra in different resonance conditions .",
    "we treat both the analytically tractable case of short ranged interactions and the physically relevant case of the coulomb luttinger liquid . in the coulomb case",
    "we predict an asymmetric broadening of the spectral peak in the higher energy side arising from the curvature of the plasmon dispersion .",
    "we find that most aspects of the rrs spectra are similar to those predicted by the fermi liquid approach .",
    "as noted in our previous work @xcite , characteristic luttinger effects are revealed in the dependence of the intensities on the difference of the laser frequency from the resonance condition .",
    "going beyond the bosonic expansion developed in our earlier work @xcite , we present explicit results for the total spectral weights of the charge boson and spin boson excitations in the polarized rrs channel .",
    "far from resonance we find that the spin - singlet mode at energy , @xmath1 , has spectral weight much smaller than that of the charge boson ( i.e. plasmon ) ; however as resonance is approached the weights in the two contributions become comparable .",
    "we explain the difference between the luttinger liquid results presented here and the fermi liquid results presented previously @xcite .",
    "our results remain inconsistent with present experimental data , so we argue that luttinger liquid effects have not yet been unambiguously detected in rrs experiments .",
    "one possibility is that excitonic effects , neglected in the present and previous treatments , are important .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ rrs_theory ] we develop a general theory of resonant raman scattering in luttinger liquids .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section we present a derivation of the rrs scattering cross section for a luttinger liquid .",
    "we consider an idealized model of a quasi - one - dimensional system , in which the electron motion in the transverse directions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is assumed to be completely frozen due to a strong confinement potential in both conduction and valence band(in other words , we consider only the lowest conduction and highest valence subband ) .",
    "our results are likely to apply also to the case where the resonance occurs via some other intermediate state , but we have not considered this case explicitly .    the longitudinal ( @xmath4 direction ) motion is assumed to be free without defects or disorder",
    ". an important feature of quantum wires is the coulomb interaction , which is typically unscreened and leads to a long ranged interaction with a well - known characteristic form @xcite involving the transverse wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the scale dependence of the unscreened coulomb interaction complicates considerably the analysis of luttinger liquid formulae , but as will be seen also leads to the appearance of additional structures in the predicted rrs spectra . in this section",
    "we derive an expression for the rrs cross section of a general model with arbitrary electron interaction .",
    "subsequent sections present results for short ranged interactions ( where the analysis can be carried through in considerable analytical detail ) and the more physically relevant long ranged interaction , which requires additional approximations .",
    "the appropriate theoretical starting point for analysis of raman scattering is the following general hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the hamiltonians for the valence and conduction bands respectively , and @xmath8 gives the coupling of these carriers to externally applied radiation .",
    "@xmath9 describes the excitonic interaction between conduction band electrons and valence band holes , and may be important in certain conditions @xcite .",
    "we will assume excitonic effects are irrelevant in the energy regime of interest and will therefore set @xmath10 throughout this paper .",
    "in this case , the rrs process involves only one electron excited out of the valence band , so that interactions in the valence band can be also neglected .",
    "we consider a single one - dimensional conduction sub - band and a valence subband , linearize the dispersion about the fermi level and include an ( at this stage arbitrary ) interaction between conduction band electrons .",
    "these considerations imply @xmath11 where the conduction band hamiltonian can be bosonized as in the standard luttinger liquid theory @xcite , yielding @xmath12 we approximate the valence band energy , @xmath13 , by a linear dispersion about the fermi wavevector of electrons in the conduction band : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rrs resonance energy ( see fig .",
    "[ band](a ) ) .",

    "[ ] ) , and neglect the four - leg vertex where photon number is conserved ( see fig .",

    "in this paper we have presented a complete analytical theory of resonant raman scattering in luttinger liquids , and for comparison we have also given the analogous results for what is referred to in the literature as the fermi liquid approximation . in this section",

    "we discuss the relevant parameter regimes and the different behavior expected in each regime , and in the third subsection we discuss the extent to which raman scattering has observed , or can be expected to observe , evidence for luttinger liquid behavior in quasi one dimensional systems .",
    "we note that both luttinger liquid and fermi liquid calculations require three assumptions :    _ ( i ) _ that the energy @xmath37 and momentum @xmath36 transferred to the one dimensional electron system are small in comparison the the fermi energy and fermi momentum of the one dimensional electron system    _ ( ii ) _ that the raman process involves excitation from a one dimensional valence band to an empty state in a one dimensional conduction band , followed by decay of an electron from a filled state in the conduction band into the hole state in the valence band    _ ( iii ) _ that excitonic correlations between conduction band states and the intermediate state may be neglected .",
    "( i ) _ is essentially a condition that the experimental resolution is sufficient to reveal the low energy physics of the system of interest . from the theoretical point of view",
    "it could easily be relaxed at the expense of introducing a more complicated description of the conduction band .",
    "assumption _ ( ii ) _ is clearly applicable to strictly one dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes ( where the valence band is clearly one dimensional ) but may not be applicable to quantum wire structures created by lithographic or mbe techniques on a three dimensional substrate . in this situation , valence band carriers may be able to move transverse to the wire . because momentum transverse to the wire is not conserved in the optical absorbtion process , in this case the function @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) must be integrated over a range of transverse momenta , leading to a broadening of the resonance .",
    "however , assumption _ ( ii ) _ may also be relaxed .",
    "the key issue is that the intermediate state ( of whatever origin ) disperses only along the wire .",
    "the crucial assumption is _",
    "( iii ) _ , neglect of excitonic correlations .",
    "these are likely to play a crucial role in the qwr structures , keeping the valence hole near the wire and therefore allowing a sharp resonance to occur .",
    "neglect of excitonic correlations entered the theory at several points , and the theory can not be trivially modified to include them .",
    "construction of a theory including excitonic effects is an important open issue in the field .    by combining the three assumptions given above with standard second order perturbation methods , we obtained results , presented in sec .",

    "( [ wcharge])-([wspinsmall ] ) , for the resonant raman scattering intensities of a one dimensional electronic system described by the luttinger liquid model . for comparison",
    ", we also presented analytical expressions for the raman intensities of the previously discussed fermi liquid model \" ( in which the only electron - electron interaction considered is forward scattering in the density channel , and this is treated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) ) . in the far - from resonance regime",
    ", we showed that a perturbative treatment could be applied , and this was used to provide a detailed characterization of the different features of the spectrum , including cde and spe peaks and a continuum absorption and the dependence of the intensity of these features on the difference of the laser frequency from resonance .",
    "we also obtained simple , easily evaluated expressions for the integrated intensities in the spe and cde peaks for all values of the laser frequency , and from these we obtained results for the ratio of spe to cde intensities .",
    "the expressions have an interesting analytical structure in the near - resonance region , which is discussed below .",
    "the raman process creates a particle and a hole in the conduction band , at a space - time separation controlled by the difference of the laser frequency from a resonance condition .",
    "the particle - hole pair is in general not an eigenstate of the conduction band hamiltonian , but decays into eigenstates .",
    "the important question , therefore , is `` what properties of the eigenstates are reveals by raman scattering '' .  in the one dimensional context",
    "one may sharpen this question to `` what aspects of the raman spectrum reveal characteristic features of the luttinger liquid physics expected to occur in one dimensional systems ? '' . in order to answer this question",
    "precisely , it is necessary to discuss the eigenstates of one dimensional electronic systems .",
    "we are concerned here with polarized channel raman scattering in systems with negligible spin - orbit coupling and therefore must consider excitations which do not change the total spin of the one dimensional system . in a fermi liquid ,",
    "the eigenstates are particle - hole pairs , either organized into collective models or existing as incoherent \" particle - hole continuum states .",
    "further , in a fermi liquid at low energies and long wavelengths one may restrict attention to states consisting of a single excited ( quasi)-particle or ( quasi)-hole : multipair states are important only as virtual processes renormalizing matrix elements and dispersions . in a fermi liquid with repulsive interactions ,",
    "there are two kinds of relevant states .",
    "one is the zero sound ( or plasmon ) mode , referred to in the raman literature as the cde mode .",
    "( in principal other collective modes exist ; these are rarely important in practice ) .",
    "the cde excitation typically has a well defined energy - momentum dispersion relation @xmath192 with velocity @xmath193 greater than the fermi velocity @xmath84 .",
    "the other class of states , referred to in the raman literature as spe , are the particle - hole continuum states . in two and three dimensional systems ,",
    "these excitations exist in the range @xmath194 ; in @xmath195 they exist only in the range @xmath196 with @xmath197 a measure of the curvature of the quasi - particle dispersion .",
    "in any dimension , the spe or continuum excitations make an important contribution to the specific heat and to most response functions . however , the contribution of the continuum excitations to the structure factor ( density response function ) is typically much smaller than that of the cde ( plasmon ) mode . in @xmath198",
    "the cde contribution to the structure factor is larger than the spe contribution by a factor of the dimensionless long wavelength interaction strength , which for a charged fermi liquid involves factors of @xmath199  arising from the long ranged nature of the coulomb interaction ( here @xmath200 is the thomas - fermi screening length ) . in @xmath195",
    "the factor arising from the coulomb interaction is only logarithmic ; however the special kinematics of one dimensional systems lead to additional constraints . within the rpa approximation",
    "the spe contribution to the structure factor is smaller than the cde contribution by a factor of @xmath201 . in the linearized dispersion limit @xmath202 )",
    "the spe contribution to the @xmath195 structure factor vanishes entirely within rpa approximation , and indeed this vanishing may be shown via a ward identity @xcite to occur to all orders in the interaction .",
    "we emphasize , however , that in the fermi liquid approximation to the one dimensional electron gas , the spe excitations exist , and may be revealed either by considering response functions other than the structure factor , or from the specific heat .",
    "a specific example of a response function other than the structure factor is provided by the raman intensity near resonance .    in one dimensional systems ,",
    "the fermi liquid approximation is believed to provide a very poor description of the low energy physics , which is believed to be more accurately represented by the luttinger liquid model .",
    "consider first a spinless electron gas .",
    "this could be realized in practice by applying a magnetic field large enough to fully spin - polarize the conduction band .",
    "it is believed that a correct treatment ( for example , via the luttinger model ) would predict that the _ only _ elementary excitation is a boson , roughly equivalent to the zero sound or plasmon mode .",
    "thus in the spinless luttinger liquid case , in all response functions and also in the specific heat , only superpositions of plasmons would be observed , whereas the fermi liquid approximation predicts one would observe features at both energies . in raman language ,",
    "in the luttinger liquid case only the cde mode would be visible , no matter how closely the system is tuned to resonance , whereas for a hypothetical 1d fermi liquid , excitation at the spe energy would become visible as the laser frequency is tuned to resonance .",
    "now consider the luttinger liquid formed by the usual electron gas , in zero magnetic field . in this case ,",
    "two classes of elementary excitation exist : charge and spin bosons",
    ". states of total spin zero may be constructed from states of two or more spin bosons , even if no charge bosons are present , and these may make important contributions to many response functions and to the specific heat . in the linearized dispersion limit , states involving only spin bosons do not appear in the structure function , which couples only to charge .",
    "however , curvature in the dispersion leads to charge - spin coupling and in particular to terms allowing a virtual charge boson to decay into two spin bosons .",
    "thus , just as in the fermi liquid case , if nonlinearity in the underlying dispersion is neglected , only the cde mode is visible in the structure factor , but at order @xmath201 spe contributions appear , and of course spe contributions appear in response functions other than the structure factor .    to summarize this subsection : as long as the electron number is not changed , the apparently profound differences between a luttinger and a fermi liquid produce only minor , quantitative differences in the excitation spectrum of an electron gas in zero magnetic field . in both cases , one has two classes of excitation , which may be labelled cde and spe . far from resonance ,",
    "the matrix element determining the raman spectrum is the density operator @xmath203 plus additional operators which vanish as the ratio @xmath204 vanishes ( i.e. as the laser frequency is moved arbitrarily far from the resonance condition ) . in the limit @xmath205",
    "the raman spectrum is the same as the structure factor . in both luttinger and fermi liquids",
    "the spe mode makes an intrinsic contribution to the structure factor which is smaller by a factor of @xmath201 independent of difference of laser frequency from resonance and which vanishes when curvature is neglected .",
    "however , for a spin polarized electron gas , there is an important difference between a luttinger and a fermi liquid : in the fermi liquid approximation an spe branch of excitations exists , whereas in a luttinger liquid it does not .",
    "the previous subsections have shown that in the polarized channel of rrs experiment ( i.e. no spin - flipping of final electron configuration ) , the differences between the predicted raman spectra of a luttinger liquid and fermi liquid approximations to the one dimensional electron gas are quantitative , not qualitative . very far from resonance , the raman spectrum is determined by the structure factor , so differences between the two cases involve differences in the structure factor .",
    "these are unimportant , arising from different coefficients of the @xmath201 terms in the structure factor .",
    "because the coefficients involve non - universal factors , this difference does not provide a useful distinction between the two cases .",
    "a more useful distinction arises from consideration of the changes arising in the spectrum as the laser frequency is brought closer to a resonance condition .",
    "as this occurs , operators other than the structure factor begin to contribute to the raman spectrum , and the nature and coefficients of these operators may be used to distinguish between the two cases .    in discussing the near - resonance behavior",
    "it is helpful to refer to fig .",
    "[ rpa ] which shows the diagrams commonly considered in the `` fermi liquid '' treatment of the rrs process . from these diagrams",
    "one sees that in the fermi liquid approximation , the states created by the raman process have nonvanishing overlap with the two sorts of exact eigenstates ( cde and spe ) of the system .",
    "diagram 1 gives the dominant contribution to the probability of creating an spe excitation .",
    "the direct overlap between the state created by the raman process and the exact eigenstate of the system means that in the absence of excitonic correlations between the particle - hole pair and the intermediate resonant state ( sketched as dash - dot lines in diagram 1 of fig [ rpa ] ) , this diagram diverges strongly .",
    "( the diagram might also diverge strongly even in the presence of excitonic effects : this point has not been investigated . )",
    "indeed one sees from eq .",
    "( [ d131 ] ) that very near resonance the term diverges as @xmath206 and ( in the absence of excitonic correlations or of the phenomenological broadening @xmath176 ) is _ infinite _ for @xmath207 . on the other hand",
    ", one sees from diagram 2 that the coupling of the raman process to the cde excitation goes through a range of virtual states ( represented by the triangles in diagram 2 ) ; this broadens the resonance effect so that the divergence as resonance is approached is only logarithmic and the result is finite for @xmath177 .",
    "however , the one dimensional kinematics lead for @xmath208 to a much greater cde amplitude than an spe amplitude , so that the spe / cde ratio only becomes of order unity very close to the resonance condition .",
    "further , for @xmath177 the fermi liquid approximation to the spe intensity is , strictly speaking , infinite , and must be regularized by consideration of processes so far omitted from the approximation .  at present",
    "there is no theory of this regularization , which is parametrized by a phenomenological broadening @xmath176 .",
    "the fermi liquid results presented in this paper in the near - resonance regime are probably meaningless .",
    "we suspect that this issue also arises in the higher dimensional calculations performed so far .    in the luttinger liquid approximation ,",
    "the particle - hole pair created in the raman process has vanishing overlap with any exact eigenstate .",
    "this has three consequences : first , a continuum absorption arising from multiboson excitations is predicted to lie in between the spe and cde peaks ( actually , this continuum would exist also in a fermi liquid , but would be much weaker ) . also , away from resonance , the spe / cde ratio is larger than in the fermi liquid approximation , and it varies with a power related to the luttinger liquid exponent @xmath88 .",
    "finally , in the on - resonance regime @xmath209 both spe and cde contributions are predicted to be finite , although both exhibit a discontinuity when @xmath210 .",
    "fermi liquid behavior is recovered because the magnitude of the discontinuity is @xmath211 and diverges in the noninteracting ( @xmath163 ) limit .",
    "we suggest that in the on - resonance regime @xmath212 neither the fermi liquid nor the luttinger liquid calculation are likely to be quantitatively reliable , because excitonic correlations ( neglected here ) are likely to be important : near resonance the intermediate state lasts so long that it must interact with the conduction band excitations , and these interactions are likely to have a nontrivial interplay with the non - analyticities arising when @xmath213 .",
    "in this paper we have used the full luttinger liquid model to analytically and numerically calculate the rrs spectrum for both polarized and depolarized spectroscopy , and have presented for comparison a fermi liquid calculation .",
    "we obtained results for both a short ranged ( screened coulomb ) interactions and for the more physically relevant case of the long ranged coulomb interaction .",
    "we clarified the difference between the fermi - liquid and luttinger liquid results , and argued that proper treatment of excitonic interactions ( neglected in all treatments so far ) is essential for obtaining reliable results .",
    "our results in fig . [ 12_rrs ] and fig .",
    "[ rrs_cll_12 ] shows that the rrs spectra of both short - ranged and long - ranged interactions are qualitatively similar , except that in the unscreened coulomb case the momentum dependent charge velocity makes the phase space of multiboson excitations to be highly restricted , which shift the multiboson excitations to higher energy than the plasmon energy @xmath122 , causing such unusual broadening .",
    "the spe - cde ratio is generically larger in a luttinger liquid than in a fermi liquid , except on - resonance , where excitonic effects probably invalidate either calculation .",
