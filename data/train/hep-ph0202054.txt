    "these processes are sensitive to the scalar mass matrices structure , a non  diagonality of the latter in a basis in which fermions are diagonal , leads to a hard violation of flavor .",
    "the structure of the scalar mass matrices is very sensitive to the susy  breaking , in particular in models where susy is softly broken , lfv imposes a severe constraint in the flavor dependence of the soft  terms as they are generated in gut s and string inspired models @xcite .    the inclusion of a `` see  saw '' mechanism in the mssm provides a very attractive scenario to understand neutrino oscillations with very small neutrino masses , and at the same time gives rates for lfv processes accessible in projected experiments @xcite .",

    "<S> the simplest unified extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with bi - linear r  parity violation naturally predicts a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum , suitable to explain atmospheric and solar neutrino fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we study whether the individual violation of the lepton numbers @xmath0 in the charged sector can lead to measurable rates for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that some of the r  parity violating terms that are compatible with the observed atmospheric neutrino oscillations could lead to rates for @xmath3 measurable in projected experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath4 obtained for those parameters is too high to be compatible with the solar neutrino data , excluding therefore the possibility of having measurable rates for @xmath5 in the model .    </S>",
