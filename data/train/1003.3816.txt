    "large ground state occupations are also found when @xmath175 .",
    "when @xmath192 , it is generally not possible to reach large ground - state occupations , even though cooling can be performed which has analogous efficiency as doppler cooling .",
    "differing from photon scattering , in the case of electron tunneling we do not have diffusion processes , which are otherwise encountered when energy is dissipated by spontaneous emission in free space . for this reason , eq .",
    "( [ n0 ] ) has the same form found in sideband cooling of trapped ions under specific conditions , where diffusion due to photon scattering is suppressed  @xcite . the same equation ( for other physical parameters )",
    "was derived in theoretical treatments of cooling of nanomechanical resonators via photons  @xcite , where the cooling dynamics was mapped to sideband cooling of trapped ions . in our case",
    ", however , the parameters for which @xmath113 is minimum do not coincide with the ones , at which @xmath111 is maximum , and optimal cooling is found as a compromise between maximizing the electromechanical cooling rate , @xmath111 , and minimizing the lower bound to the mean phonon value , @xmath113 , so to effectively counteract the thermalization rate due to the coupling with the external environment .",
    "we have presented an extensive analysis of the efficiency of ground state cooling of the phononic mode of a resonator , constituted by a suspended carbon - nanotube in a double quantum dot configuration .",
    "the analysis takes into account dephasing in the current through the double dot and the finite q of the resonator .",
    "ground state cooling is possible provided that the dephasing rate is smaller than the resonator frequency .",
    "moreover , largest efficiency are obtained when the permanence time scale of the excess electron inside the double dot exceeds the time scale in which the double dot has no excess electron .",
    "when the dephasing rate is larger than the resonator frequency , the resonator can be still cooled provided that the tunable system parameters are accordingly chosen .",
    "most parameters of the proposed setup can be tuned .",
    "the frequency @xmath5 of the resonator , for instance , depends on the length of the nanotube section that is suspended .",
    "the frequency difference @xmath136 and the tunneling rates @xmath193 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , can be controlled by the external gates  @xcite",
    ". electron dephasing rate , however , remains to be measured in nanotubes .",
    "we remark that the proposed cooling scheme can be applied to other device layouts , such as mechanical resonators electrostatically coupled to fixed dqds  @xcite .",
