    "we used a response matrix appropriate for the off - axis position of the source . because the position of maxi  j1409@xmath0619  is close to the galactic plane",

    "from figure  [ find - chart ] we can see that we have three sets of pds offset observations covering the maxi  j1409@xmath0619  position . for two of them ( op01652 and op08484 ) we do not have sufficient statistics to perform a useful analysis ( see the observed count rates in table  [ tab : pointings ] ) . on the other hand , for the moff offset field of the circinus galaxy observation , op10480 ,",
    "data have enough statistics for a thorough spectral analysis .",
    "first , we checked for the presence of any catalogued x ",

    "no significant x ",
    "ray emission has been detected around the _ egret _ source @xcite ; therefore we associate the pds detection with maxi  j1409@xmath0619 .",
    "we started by extracting a 15100  kev coarser binned pds spectrum of the moff field ( assuming as its background the corresponding poff spectrum ) .",
    "the fit with a power law gives a photon index of @xmath30 , with a normalized @xmath26 of 1.31 for 11 dof . from the shape of the residuals and from the quite different photon index with respect to the on - source observation",
    ", we suspected the presence of a change of slope in the spectrum between 20 and 30  kev .",
    "this break is not detected in the on - source observation because of its poor statistics .",
    "we tried both a broken and a cutoff power law . by fixing the cutoff energy at 25  kev ( we were only able to constrain the break / cutoff energy between 20 and 40  kev ) , a cutoff power law fit gives a power law index @xmath31 , with a normalized @xmath26 of 1.06 for 11 dof . while from a statistical point of view the two fits are equivalent ( an f - test gives a 36% probability of chance improvement ( pci ) of the @xmath24  see appendix  [ app - cookbook ] for the discussion on the correctness of the use of the f - test ) , the cutoff fit nicely matches the spectral index observed at lower energies .",
    "the corresponding 15100  kev flux , corrected for the triangular response of the collimator , is @xmath32 erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 .",
    "intrigued by the shape of the residuals , we tried a smaller rebinning factor and a wider ( 15200  kev ) energy range .",
    "we were surprised to find the spectrum shown in figure  [ pds_cyc ] .",
    "absorption features at @xmath1140 , @xmath1170 , and @xmath11120  kev are quite evident .",
    "we also noted that the points that trail these features at @xmath1150 , @xmath1190 , and @xmath11150  kev seems to be in agreement with a hard continuum up to 200  kev . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we performed a fit to the data below 30  kev together with these trailing points .",
    "no cutoff ( the break energy is not constrained ) or broken power law ( the two photon indices are equal ) model are able to fit the data , while a power law with photon index @xmath33 does ( @xmath34 for 20 dof ) .",
    "therefore the change of slope in 2040  kev derived from the analysis of the coarser binned energy spectrum is really due to the presence of the absorption features .",
    "the first absorption feature drives the position of the break , while the higher energy ones are spread by the rebinning , resulting in low - count , high energy bins that are fit by a change of slope .    to further support this interpretation",
    ", we performed a joint fit with the mecs spectrum ( this analysis is detailed in appendix  [ app - fit ] ) .",
    "we find that a cutoff or a broken power law models are not able to fit this broad band spectrum with the constraint @xmath35 below 10  kev .",
    "this implies that the origin of the change of slope is not due to the presence of a cutoff but to something else , likely absorption features . for this reasons as the continuum we will use a power law with @xmath36 fixed at @xmath37 , as derived by the analysis on the broad band spectrum of the first observation .    as throughly discussed in appendix  [ app - cookbook ] , the assessment of the statistical significance of these absorption features has to be done with great care .",
    "our strategy was to evaluate the significance of each feature one at a time .",
    "we started with a power law fit in the energy range 1555  kev , and we obtained an unacceptable @xmath26 of 1.4 for 25 dof .",
    "the inclusion of a gaussian in absorption ( ` gabs ` in xspec ) with centroid energy @xmath38  kev , @xmath39 , and width fixed at 4  kev significantly improved the fit ( @xmath26 equal to 0.48 for 23 dof ) .",
    "two comments on this measurement are in order : first , the @xmath1144  kev line is statistically significant ( pci is @xmath40 ) .",
    "second , the difficulties in determining the other line parameters ( the line width had to be fixed , while the line normalization is affected by large errors ) are due to the fact that the lines are seen as `` holes '' in the continuum : we have not enough statistics to clearly reconstruct the line profile . the line width is therefore computed from the `` hole '' width , while for the line depth we can infer only an upper limit ( this will be more evident for the lines at higher energies ) .    following our detection strategy , we performed a second fit on the 1580  kev energy range .",
    "the fit with only one gaussian in absorption was not acceptable : @xmath26 was 3.6 for 32 dof . by adding another gaussian in absorption we obtained a significantly better fit , with @xmath26 of 0.48 for 30 dof ( pci is @xmath41 ) .",
    "the second line parameters are @xmath42  kev , @xmath43 , while the the line width was fixed at 7  kev .",
    "note how the two line energies are not in an harmonic ratio .",
    "then we extended the energy range to the whole 15200  kev band . again",
    "the fit with two lines was not acceptable ( @xmath26 of 4.5 for 46 dof ) , so we added another absorption line , the width of which was fixed at 7  kev .",
    "the fit significantly improved ( @xmath26 of 0.58 for 44 dof , pci of @xmath16 ) , with the best fit @xmath44  kev .",
    "@xmath45 was not constrained ( this was not a surprise because , as discussed above , we have no signal in the `` hole '' , and therefore we are not able to put a limit to the line normalization ) .    finally , we constrained the line energies to be in an harmonic ratio .",
    "in this case we obtain a @xmath26 of 1.22 for 46 dof .",
    "the best fit parameters of the fundamental were @xmath46  kev , @xmath47 .",
    "all the line widths were fixed , as in the previous case with the line energies left free , but we were not able to constrain the ( 1:2 ) and ( 1:3 ) line normalizations .    in order to verify that the observed features were not of instrumental origin , and at the same time to better characterize the cyclotron resonance features ( thereafter crfs ) , we performed a normalized crab ratio analysis @xcite on the moff spectrum , as we successfully employed for the detection of crfs in numerous x  ray pulsars ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as it is evident from the top panel of figure  [ crabratio ] , the ratio between the maxi  j1409@xmath0619  and the crab count rate spectra shows a `` hole '' in the 3844  kev range , due to the fundamental crf . to enhance the feature",
    ", we multiplied the maxi  j1409@xmath0619/crab ratio by the functional form of the crab spectrum , i.e.  a simple power law with photon index equal to 2.1 .",
    "the result is shown in the second panel of figure  [ crabratio ] .",
    "finally , in the lower panel , we show the ratio between the previous function and the maxi  j1409@xmath0619  best fit continuum power law model , together with a gaussian fit to the fundamental crf .",
    "the gaussian width was fixed at 4  kev , while the gaussian centroid energy is @xmath48  kev .",
    "please note that this value is a lower limit , because it does not take into account the intrinsic energy resolution of the pds instrument .    in order to give a quantitative evaluation of the crf in the normalized crab ratio we performed a run test ( see detailed discussion in appendix  [ app - cookbook ] ) . up to @xmath1134  kev the residuals are consistent with random fluctuations ( @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; @xmath51",
    "; consistent with random fluctuation at the 84% ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the 3450  kev band we see a clear structure in the residuals . in this case from a run test with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 we we can reject the null hypothesis of randomness at the 99% confidence level .      the region around maxi  j1409@xmath0619  was observed by asca on march 2 , 1998 for a net exposure time of about 18  ks .",
    "the source is clearly detected , and its spectrum is confirmed to be quite hard , with a best fit power law photon index @xmath55 and an unabsorbed 110  kev flux of @xmath56 erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 . the absorption in the direction of the source is not well constrained by the fit , with an upper limit of @xmath57 @xmath4 , consistent with the _ swift _ and _ bepposax_/mecs results .",
    "as stressed by @xcite , a nir source belonging to the 2mass catalogue @xcite is found within 21 of the maxi  j1409@xmath0619   position as determined by the xrt . according to that catalogue , this source ( labeled as 2mass  j14080271@xmath06159020 ) has nir magnitudes @xmath58",
    "= 15.874@xmath80.086 , @xmath59 = 13.620@xmath80.022 and @xmath60 = 12.560@xmath80.021 .",
    "no catalogued optical counterpart is present at the position of this nir source , and inspection of the dss - ii - red digitized archival plates does not show any evident optical object at that location . following @xcite we can thus place a conservative upper limit , @xmath6120 , to the @xmath62-band magnitude of the optical counterpart of this source .",
    "the above magnitudes thus indicate that this is an extremely red object .    indeed , assuming the milky way extinction law @xcite",
    ", we find that the nir color indices of this source are consistent with those of a late o / early b - type star @xcite with a reddening of @xmath63 mag .",
    "this , using the formula of @xcite , implies a column density of n@xmath64 @xmath11 3.6@xmath6510@xmath66 @xmath4 , which is consistent with that inferred from the _ swift _ and _ bepposax _   spectral analysis results .",
    "this large extinction is also supported by the non - detection of the optical counterpart of the source .",
    "all this points to a likely hmxb nature of this source , hosting a heavily absorbed early - type star , similar to several cases of _ integral _ hard x  ray sources identified as hmxbs at optical and/or nir wavelengths ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming then @xmath67 mag along the maxi  j1409@xmath0619  line of sight and a b0 spectral type for the companion star in this system , we can infer its distance , depending on the luminosity class ( main sequence , giant or supergiant ) of the star . using the tabulated absolute magnitudes for this type of star @xcite we find , for these three cases , respective distances of @xmath114.6 , @xmath117.9 and @xmath1114.5 kpc .",
    "given that the large absorption found along the line of sight of this source at both nir and x  ray wavelengths is consistent with the galactic one , we consider most likely that the correct distance is the largest one .",
    "thus , maxi  j1409@xmath0619  is quite likely located in the far side of the galaxy , i.e.  in the farthest parts of the sagittarius - carina arm , and its mass donor star is likely an early - type supergiant .",

    "three crfs were observed during the 20042005 outburst of the x  ray pulsar v0332 + 53 @xcite , and five ( possible six ) crfs were discovered in the spectrum of 4u  0115 + 63 during its 1999 giant outburst @xcite . in both cases , deviations from a pure harmonic ratio among the crfs were observed , and were explained in terms of departures from a classical dipolar structure of the magnetic field in the line - forming region @xcite .    the magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface corresponding to @xmath68  kev is @xmath9  g @xcite , where @xmath10 , the gravitational redshift , for a typical neutron star of mass 1.4  m@xmath69 and radius 10  km , is about 0.3 .",

    "the analysis of the significance of spectral absorption features , and in particular crfs , has historically been fraught with serious misunderstanding , that we attribute to the application of techniques made for _ emission _ features to absorption ones .",
    "this has a very profound impact on the statistical analysis , as detailed in the following .",
    "first , when searching for spectral features , and especially absorption features , the binning of data is crucial : indeed a narrow feature can be lost if the data binning is too high ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , as we showed in the data analysis detailed in section  [ moff - ana ] .",
    "but before searching for the best binning factor , it has become customary to rebin data in order to achieve a minimum number of counts in each bin .",
    "the reason of this procedure is that we must avoid bins with few counts if we want to use the @xmath24 statistics to test for the goodness of our fit ( in other words , errors must be normally distributed ) .",
    "a minimum 20  counts per bin filter is sufficient to achieve this goal @xcite .",
    "the application of this criterion to background subtracted spectra is correct for instruments that are not background dominated ( that is , they have an intrinsically low number of counts per bin ) , like a detector on the focal plane of x  ray optics . on the other hand , when the net source spectrum is obtained by subtracting two high counts",
    "spectra this correction _ must not _ be applied ( instruments like _ bepposax_/pds or _",
    "rxte_/hexte are background dominated , with a very high number of counts per energy channel ) .",
    "although the net source counts can be very low , they are still gaussian distributed , because resulting from the difference of two normally distributed counts .",
    "second , if features are present in the source spectrum , they ( clearly ) show up in the fit residuals , and the standard goodness of fit estimator , the minimization of the @xmath24 statistics @xcite , should ( clearly ) indicate that the fit is not `` good '' and an additional component is necessary .",
    "the inclusion of a new component to the continuum should result in a reduction of the reduced @xmath24 . in order to assess whether the improvement of the @xmath24 is due to chance or",
    "it is because the new component is significant it is customary to use the f - test ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a very important point has to be raised here , because we have two completely different approaches whether we are dealing with emission or absorption features . in the former case we are dealing , using a xspec terminology , with an _ additive _ component , and we test the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the new term is zero @xcite .",
    "this is the f - test routine that is incorporated in the recent versions of xspec .    on the other hand , when dealing with an absorption feature , the component is _ not _ additive but multiplicative ( see routines ` gabs ` or ` cyclabs ` ) .",
    "it is therefore obvious that we can not use the f - test for an additive component , because we can not vary to zero the new component coefficient without modifying the parameters of the original model .",
    "the two components ( the multiplicative model and the original continuum ) are strongly coupled , and variations in one will affect also the other . therefore we must use a different f - test , as described in @xcite , that tests the null hypothesis that the observed variances comes from the same sample ( and this routine is _ not _ incorporated in xspec ) .",
    "this same test must be used to assess if two different models are statistically equivalent or not ( and indeed we used it in section  [ moff - ana ] to compare the power law and the cutoff power law fits ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the application of the f - test to the statistical assessment of crfs is not affected by the concerns raised by its use with emission lines @xcite .",
    "third , crfs are very shallow features , with their count rates often at the instrument sensitivity level .",
    "we therefore expect errors to be dominant , and consequently the @xmath24 could not be the best estimator of the crf significance .",
    "we need a test that takes into account the structure of the line ( an information which is lost in the @xmath24 , because we compute the square of the difference between the data and the model ) . in other words",
    ", we need to compute what is the probability that a particular structure visible in the fit residuals occurs by chance .",
    "the run test ( also known as wald - wolfowitz test ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) works on the _ signs _ of the deviations , that is on the form of the residuals .",
    "to better clarify how the run test works give a look at figure  [ runtest ] , adapted from @xcite : when fitting the 12 data points with a straight line the normalized @xmath24 is exactly 1 ( likely due to error overestimation ) .",
    "but it is evident by eye that the fit is not good ( indeed the data come from a parabolic model ) .",
    "the reason is that if the fit were good we should expect that the number of points `` above '' the fitting line should not group together , but should be intermixed with points `` below '' the fitting line ( and this should be more true as the number of data points increases ) . if , on the other hand , we observe only small groups of data with the same `` sign '' ( called _ runs _ )",
    ", this means that our data are not randomly distributed with respect to the fitting model , but there is an underlying trend .",
    "as we can see from figure  [ runtest ] , we have 12 points , 6 points `` above '' the fitting line ( let us call them @xmath82 ) and 6 points `` below '' the fitting line ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the number of runs @xmath84 is only 3 , suspiciously small .",
    "indeed the probability of obtaining @xmath85 is 1.3% , telling us that the structure observed in the residuals is not due to random fluctuations but to a wrong modelization ( the linear fit ) .",
    "from this example , and from the real - case analysis performed on the residuals shown in figures  [ crabratio ] and [ mecs - pds ] , should be clear that the goodness of fit in the case of data structures in the residuals should not be addressed _ only _ with the @xmath24 estimator , but it has to be supported by the run test .    in conclusion",
    ", this is a sort of _ cookbook _ for a correct evaluation of the statistical significance of absorption ( crfs ) features in the spectra of x  ray sources :    1 .",
    "be careful with the binning : although crfs are usually broad features , a too small binning can hide structures . when dealing with background dominated data ( like , for example , _ bepposax_/pds or _",
    "rxte_/hexte net spectra ) _ never _ rebin data in order to have a minimum number of counts per bin , otherwise we risk to lose the absorption feature ; 2 .   in order to assess the significance of a crf",
    "the f - test is perfectly suitable , but we must use the correct routine : the f - test routine included in xspec is applicable only to an additive component ( in particular , an emission line ) , while both ` gabs ` and ` cyclabs ` are multiplicative ; 3 .   the evaluation of the statistical significance of a crf must be supported by other tests , especially in the presence of structures in the fit residuals : the run test is able to discriminate whether the structure is due to random fluctuations or not .",
    "the analysis performed on the broad band spectrum of the pointed maxi  j1409@xmath0619   observation yields as best fit continuum a power law with index @xmath110.9 ( see section  [ on - ana ] ) . on the other hand , the analysis performed on a coarser binned spectrum of the offset observation indicates the presence of a change of slope around 2040  kev ( see section  [ moff - ana ] ) . because a finer rebinning of this second observation revealed the presence of features that can be explained as crsfs , it is important to understand whether this change of slope is due to a cutoff in the continuum or is a combined effect of the binning and the presence of the absorption features .    from the pointed observation we know that data below 10  kev must be described by a power law with @xmath35 . to take into account this constraint we performed a joint fit of the high energy pds spectrum from the second observation with the low energy mecs spectrum from the first observation .",
    "although the two spectra come from different observations , x  ray pulsars are known to not show any spectral variability besides that at low energy due to reprocessing of x ",
    "rays by the circumstellar material ( see , for example , the case of vela x1 or gx3012 ) . because our source does not show any intrinsic absorption or emission lines , signatures of reprocessing , we are confident that our mecs spectrum did not change between the two observations .",
    "first we tried a fit with a power law , modified at low energy by photoelectric absorption .",
    "all the parameters are left free but the @xmath86 ( fixed at the @xmath87  @xmath4 value obtained from the on - source observation ) , and the result is shown in panel _",
    "a. _  of figure  [ mecs - pds ] .",
    "the fit parameters are listed in table  [ app - table ] .",
    "now let us test whether we can explain this change of slope in terms of a cutoff in the continuum .",
    "we first tried a cutoff power law ( see panel _ b. _  in figure  [ mecs - pds ] ) : the fit is statistically acceptable but the power law index does not match with that of the low energy part , below 10  kev . the systematic deviations from the model ( information lost by the @xmath24 test , as discussed in appendix  [ app - cookbook ] ) can be quantified by means of the run test on the mecs residuals ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) .",
    "the probability of obtaining @xmath85 is 0.5% , therefore the structure observed in the residuals is not due to random fluctuations but to the wrong modelization of the continuum .",
    "the same result is obtained with the broken power law fit ( see panel _ c. _  in figure  [ mecs - pds ] ) : there is no match to the mecs data .",
    "these results demonstrate that the change of slope is not in the continuum but is due to something else : we made the hypothesis that its origin are absorption features .",
    "therefore the true continuum model is a power law together with crsf features ( see panel _",
    "d. _  in figure  [ mecs - pds ] ) . because we are not able to disentangle the continuum and the crsfs , due to the broadness of the features and their low statistics , we need to fix the power law index to the value obtained by the broad band fit .    just as a test",
    ", we performed all the analysis on the crsfs by fixing the power law index at 1.0 , 1.1 , and 1.2 , corresponding to the @xmath33 value obtained from the fit to the pds data below 30  kev and the points trailing the crsfs .",
    "the crsf parameters are all consistent with each other , demonstrating that they do not depend on the particular value of the power law index ."
