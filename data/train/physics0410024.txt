    "the cortical activity of the human brain in wakefulness and eyes - closed typically exhibits the 8@xmath112 hz @xmath0 rhythm@xmath2 .",
    "although its origin remain open@xmath3 , this classical rhythm has been associated with the  resting \" state of the cortex with most pronounced activity recorded in the parietal and occipital areas .",
    "while the @xmath0 rhythm represents one of the major cortical activities , there typically lies a background  noise \" component of unknown functionality and origin@xmath4 .",
    "there is growing evidence of the importance of this background component .",
    "for example , local surface scalp measurements based on electroencephalography@xmath5 ( eeg ) and magnetoencephalography@xmath6 reveal its fractal characteristics coexisting with moderate @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "similar results were found in multi - channel recording@xmath7 , suggesting the global nature of the fractal dynamics in the cortex .",
    "the relevance of this background fluctuation in physiology may be seen from its state dependence property@xmath8 where normal individuals in eyes closed average to a larger scaling exponent than in eyes open .",
    "recent works further imply that the eeg fluctuation may have a broader implication on the other autonomic function such as the cardiovascular regulation@xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the eeg background fluctuation and its coexistence with the @xmath0 rhythm . while they are separately subjects of intense study , far less understood is the organization of these two prominent features of the brain dynamics .",
    "in addition , the findings reviewed above may require further clarifications when the @xmath0 oscillation becomes dominant .",
    "for example , a trained meditator or yoga practitioner can shift a significant portion of the eeg signal power to the @xmath0 band that obscures any potential fractal characteristics in the background fluctuation .",
    "1 shows eeg s with moderate and strong @xmath0 rhythm from a normal subject and an experienced yoga practitioner , respectively .",
    "it is observed that the power law trend diminishes almost entirely in the @xmath0 dominant eeg , but not in the @xmath0 moderate eeg .",
    "this apparently inverse relationship with the strength of @xmath0 rhythm implies either the fractal background fluctuation is buried in the @xmath0 oscillation , and can thus no longer be detected from the amplitude characteristics of the eeg , or there is simply no long - range correlated fluctuation in the @xmath0 dominant brain state . using the detrend fluctuation analysis@xmath10 ( dfa ) on the integrated @xmath0 dominant eeg actually supports the latter scenario of a white noise process in the background fluctuation ( dfa exponent @xmath10.5 ) ; see fig .",
    "however , as we show below , it is not a valid description for the @xmath0 dominant brain state .    in this work ,",
    "we use the zero - crossing property to study the eeg background fluctuation coexisting with @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "eeg zero - crossing has been primarily used to extract event - related frequency information@xmath11 . despite the obvious advantage of being insensitive to amplitude artefacts",
    ", the use of zero - rossing to study eeg background fluctuation appears scarce .",
    "watters and martins used dfa to analyze the  eeg walk \" constructed from the zero - crossing of eeg showing moderate @xmath0 rhythm@xmath12 .",
    "these authors found evidence of scaling and rejected the ( uncorrelated ) random - walk interpretation for the eeg background component .",
    "but we should point out that a dfa scaling exponent @xmath13 ( random walk ) is in fact possible in the @xmath0 dominant brain state ( fig .",
    "1c ) .    by excluding the @xmath0 wave zero - crossing",
    ", we will show that the eeg background does exhibit fractal characteristics . for the scaling analysis in @xmath0 dominant case ,",
    "the zero - crossing approach is found to be more effective than other amplitude - based methods such as the power spectral density function and dfa .",
    "the complementary set of the background zero - crossing in the real line captures other eeg activities . for the @xmath0 dominant case",
    ", this complementary set describes mainly the @xmath0 dynamics . with the confirmed eeg fractal background",
    ", we conjecture fractal scaling in the emergence of @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "support to this conjecture is found in the power law distribution of the @xmath0 interval .",
    "our analysis also suggests that the @xmath0 dominant brain state may be interpreted in the unversality class of the self - organized criticality@xmath14 of punctuated equilibrium@xmath15 .",
    "while soc has been proposed for the eeg fluctuation in the @xmath0 frequency band@xmath16 , and its analytical phase@xmath4 , our result provides further evidence of its possible connection to the organization of the eeg background dynamics and the @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "finally , we are able to write down the governing principle for this organization that relates the eeg fractal scaling and the emergence of @xmath0 dynamics .    in the next section , the main idea of extracting the zero - crossing of eeg background fluctuation",
    "is described and verified with artificial examples . in section iii , the method is applied to the eeg records taken from subjects showing little to significant @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "let the eeg be @xmath17 .",
    "the zero - crossing time is the level set @xmath18 where the index @xmath19 registers the order of the zero crossing event . in practice ,",
    "@xmath20 is first determined by linear interpolation and then used to define the set of crossing - time - interval ( cti ) @xmath21 .",
    "zero - crossing of a stochastic process is a surprisingly hard problem ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "thanks to its self - similarity , the cti for a fractal process is known to follow a power law distribution@xmath22 : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "for example , @xmath25 for the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xmath26 of hurst exponent @xmath27 .",
    "if fractal exists in the @xmath0 dominant eeg , it can be captured in @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the cti of the @xmath0 oscillation .",
    "however , fractal cti s can occasionally lie in the @xmath0 rhythm range@xmath30 .",
    "it is thus not possible to obtain @xmath29 based solely on the value of cti .",
    "what is characteristic to the rhythmic oscillation in general is a steady zero - crossing pattern of the oscillation .",
    "hence , a set of cti s is considered of @xmath0 origin if they correspond to _ continuous _ zero - crossing in the @xmath0 rhythm range .",
    "specifically , we consider a bigger set @xmath31 using the following two criteria : ( i ) the cti lies in the range of @xmath0 rhythm range and ( ii ) the cti s are from continuous zero - crossing .",
    "let such cti s be denoted by @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 describes the @xmath35 @xmath0 event segment in the eeg record .",
    "the cti s for the @xmath0 dynamics is estimated by the union of @xmath34 s : @xmath36 inevitably , some continuous zero - crossing could still come from the potential fractal component of the eeg .",
    "hence , @xmath37 is only a subset of @xmath31 . the  error \" @xmath38 depends on the fractal property as well as the strength of the @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "the complement @xmath39 captures irregular zero - crossing that is characteristic to the fractal process    for moderate @xmath0 oscillation , eeg may contain other rhythmic components . the check of continuous zero - crossing must then be extended to a reasonably large scale range . to this end",
    ", we first consider the set of large cti fluctuation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the upper and lower thresholds for defining the set of large cti .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the cti s from continuous zero - crossings in @xmath43 and let @xmath44 .",
    "finally , the set of fractal cti is obtained by @xmath45 note that this definition does not preclude fractal crossing in the @xmath0 rhythm range .",
    "note , for the @xmath0 dominant case , that continuous crossing is mainly captured in @xmath31 and , thus , @xmath46 and we recover @xmath47 as shown above . if @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mean of @xmath50 , any accidental fractal crossing included in @xmath51 will not introduce bias to the power law distribution of the fractal crossing ( fig .  2 below ) .      to demonstrate the above idea , we used hilbert transform to construct the fractal time series given by the amplitude process of fbm , @xmath52 .",
    "this is to mimic the fractal property reported in the @xmath0 band - passed eeg@xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath52 inherits the same scaling characteristics from @xmath26 .",
    "hence , @xmath54 holds , where @xmath55 is estimated from the histogram of @xmath56 . to define @xmath31 , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "were used .",
    "these values are determined from the range of cti of @xmath52 : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the sampling time .",
    "2 shows the pdf estimate of @xmath39 .",
    "it is seen that theoretical @xmath55 values are verified _ before _ and after deleting @xmath31 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this should be the case since no band - limited component exists in @xmath52 .",
    "it thus establishes deleting @xmath31 defined above does not affect the power law pdf of a pure fractal signal .    to examine the influence from the band - limited rhythmic oscillation , @xmath52 in randomly selected time intervals of variable length were replaced by a narrow - band process @xmath61 where @xmath62 models the fractal amplitude modulation@xmath53 and the narrow - band @xmath63 is a sine wave of gaussian amplitude @xmath64 and frequency @xmath65 ; i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that @xmath63 has a 10-hz central frequency to mimic the @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "to simulate the dominance of the band - limited oscillation , the probability of an interval being selected for @xmath68 is four times of those for @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the interval length for @xmath69 is at least three times shorter than those for @xmath52 .",
    "the synthetic data so constructed is shown in fig .",
    "3a .    in presenting our results ,",
    "we keep the time unit in all figures so as to make easy reference to the narrow - band oscillation .",
    "segments of cti s before and after deleting @xmath31 are shown in figs .",
    "the corresponding @xmath24 are estimated in fig .",
    "it is clear that the narrow - band component @xmath70 can create significant bias in the otherwise power law pdf of @xmath52 .",
    "the theoretical power law @xmath24 for @xmath52 is correctly described after deleting @xmath31 defined by ( 1 ) .",
    "we now apply the zero - crossing method to eeg records with varying degrees of @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "these records were collected from six subjects ( 3 males , 3 females ) of age 21 to 30 year - old ( mean : @xmath124 who gave written consent to participate in the study .",
    "all subjects were instructed to maintain normal daily activity before participating in the 5-minute recording session .",
    "surface scalp electrodes were attached according to the 10 - 20 international system at o1 , o2 , referencing to cz .",
    "two groups of data were taken : one in eyes open ( eo ) and one in eyes closed ( ec ) . for eo , subjects were asked to direct their gaze at certain part of a shielded room to minimize eyes movements . for ec ,",
    "no specific instruction was given to the subjects other than to relax and have their eyes closed .",
    "output impedence from the recording system has been kept below 5k@xmath71 .",
    "the eeg was first band - passed from 0.1 to 70 hz and then digitized with a 12-bit a / d precision at 250 hz ( first four subjects ) and 500 hz ( last two subjects ) .    in order to measure the strength of the @xmath0 rhythm",
    ", we use the ratio of eeg signal power in the 8@xmath112 hz band to the full accessible frequency range , @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "as expected , the @xmath73 is larger in ec than in eo due to the lack of visual stimulation in ec .",
    "three of the six subjects ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) are able to generate dominant @xmath0 rhythm with large @xmath73 measure ( @xmath74 ) in ec .",
    "it is important to note that low @xmath73 measure could mean very little @xmath0 activity ; e.g. , the corresponding power spectra are given by power law with little identifiable feature in the @xmath0 band .",
    "in contrast , there is always a very distinct ",
    "@xmath0 peak \" located at the 10hz range for subjects showing large @xmath73 .",
    "the cti pdf s of all eeg data sets are found to be of the power law form @xmath23 .",
    "this indicates the fractal dynamics continues to exist in the brain state showing @xmath0 rhythm .",
    "in particular , qualitatively different @xmath24 s are found before and after deleting @xmath75 from subjects showing dominant @xmath0 rhythm ( fig .",
    "4b ) , and almost the same @xmath24 from subjects showing moderate to little @xmath0 rhythm ( fig .  4c ,",
    "also fig .  2 ) . for estimating the scaling in @xmath0 dominant brain state , this means a more effective approach of using eeg zero - crossing than other amplitude - based methods such as the power spectrum and dfa ( see also fig .  1 ) .",
    "similar to the literature@xmath6 , state dependence of the eeg fractal is observed : the @xmath55 exponent is larger in eo than in ec .",
    "in addition , @xmath55 and @xmath73 follows an inverse relation in both ec and eo ( fig .",
    "if one tentatively compares to the hurst model using @xmath54 , this result means a positive correlation between the eeg fractal background scaling and the underlying @xmath0 rhythm .      the inverse relationship shown in fig .",
    "5a further suggests a relationship between the scaling property of the eeg fractal background and the @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "consider first the zero - crossing points of the eeg fractal background in the real line : @xmath76 where @xmath77 locates the end points of the cti defined in @xmath78 .",
    "the set @xmath79 can be obtained by intersecting the fractal portion of the eeg graph @xmath80 with the zero axis .",
    "let @xmath81 be the box - counting dimension for @xmath79 .",
    "it is known from geometry that @xmath82 where the ` 1 ' on the left - hand - side of this equation is the dimension of the zero axis . by the h@xmath83lder condition of the fractal function@xmath84",
    ", one can show @xmath85 .",
    "thus , @xmath86 .",
    "similarly , one can define the zero - crossing points of the @xmath0 dynamics . in principle , this is obtained by intersecting the portion of the @xmath0 oscillation in the eeg graph with the zero axis . in practice",
    ", we use the @xmath34 s in ( 1a ) to approximate the @xmath0 interval @xmath87 where the @xmath88 measures the  size \" of the @xmath35 @xmath0 event as it emerges in the foreground of the eeg .",
    "unlike the @xmath89 in ( 1a ) , which is narrowly distributed in the @xmath0 rhythm range@xmath30 , @xmath88 can in general cover a much wider range of values .",
    "the end points locating the @xmath0 intervals define the zero - crossing points @xmath90 .",
    "given the eeg fractal background established in the last section , we conjecture the same for the @xmath0 interval and a power law pdf @xmath91 .",
    "denote the box - counting dimension of @xmath92 by @xmath93 ; i.e. , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of zero - crossing points over the period @xmath96 .",
    "the power law exponent @xmath97 can be connected to @xmath98 via the relation@xmath15 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 on the right - hand - side estimates the average length of all @xmath0 intervals over the period @xmath96 . substituting the power law @xmath101 yields @xmath102 .    since the point sets @xmath79 and @xmath92",
    "are embedded in the ( 1d ) real line ( time axis ) and @xmath103 , one has @xmath104 hence , we have the inequality that connects the power law exponents of the eeg fractal background and the length of the @xmath0 rhythm : @xmath105    due to the little @xmath0 rhythm in our eo data sets , the estimation of @xmath106 was suffered from poor statistics . for the ec data sets , both power law @xmath106 and ( 3 ) are verified ( fig .",
    "we will thus focus only on the ec data in this section . in fig .",
    "5c , an interesting transition is shown from the inequality ( 3 ) in @xmath0 moderate cases ( s1 , s5 , s6 ) to almost equality @xmath107 in @xmath0 dominant cases ( s2 , s3 , s4 ) . for @xmath107 ( @xmath0 dominant ) the numerical values @xmath108 and",
    "@xmath109 are estimated . for @xmath110 ( @xmath0 moderate ) , larger @xmath55 and @xmath97 are estimated .",
    "the case of @xmath109 in the @xmath0 dominant eeg worths further discussion . in their model study of multi - trait evolution@xmath111 , boettcher and paczuski ( bp ) predicted that evolution is a self - organized critical ( soc ) process consisting of quiescent periods of all sizes , interspersed by short intervals of mutation event .",
    "these authors derived a similar power law scaling exponent of 1.75 for the distribution of the quiescent period and pointed out that their multi - trait model belongs to a new universality class .",
    "this universality condition prompted us to make the comparison of these two different phenomenologies . with the estimated @xmath109",
    ", it is tempting to compare the @xmath0 interval with the quiescent period in the bp model .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis of soc dynamics in the  resting \" state of the cortex .",
    "the eeg background fluctuation coexisting with varying degrees of @xmath0 rhythm is studied .",
    "it is important to note that our results directly address these two prominent features of the brain dynamics , rather than the eeg fluctuation in the @xmath0 frequency band@xmath16 .",
    "compared to other amplitude - based methods , we show that zero - crossing is more effective for studying the scaling in @xmath0 dominant eeg .",
    "\\(a ) an inverse relationship between the eeg background scaling and the strength of @xmath0 rhythm is observed , with a larger @xmath55 exponent in eo for all subjects . using the hurst model tentatively ( @xmath54 )",
    ", this implies a larger scaling exponent in ec compared to eo , or the trend towards more anti - persistent fluctuation in the @xmath0 dominant brain state in eo .",
    "similar state dependence propery has been reported in the past@xmath112 .",
    "stam and de bruin@xmath6 found similar result based on the correlation between the @xmath0 band desynchronization and the decrease of the ( dfa ) scaling exponent in eo .",
    "an inverse relation was also reported by moosmanns et al.@xmath113 based on the blood oxygenation level dependence contrast as a measure of the brain metabolic activity .",
    "these authors concluded a dominant @xmath0 rhythm associated with metabolic deactivation and desynchronization , a view may further be supported by the increase of local cortical activity@xmath114 and information processing during eo@xmath115 .",
    "\\(b ) the inequality ( 3 ) characterizes the organization of the coupling . since it is arrived based solely on the set - theoretic arguments , it is plausible that similar equations may exist between the eeg fractal background and other brain rhythms such as the @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 waves .",
    "the observed transition from @xmath110 to @xmath107 in @xmath0 dominant eeg , and the coincidence with the bp dynamics , imply a soc state in the @xmath0 dominant eeg .",
    "hence , a strong @xmath0 rhythm and the corresponding background fluctuation may represent two perspectives of the same dynamics .",
    "in general , this observation is in agreement with the suggestion of soc of the eeg fractal dynamics@xmath120 .",
    "however , our result differs in that we find indication of soc only at the @xmath0 dominant brain state , based mainly on the universality of the bp dynamics . for subjects showing little to moderate @xmath0 rhythm ,",
    "the unversality condition is no longer matched .",
    "we are not able to determine if a different universality class may be involved in these cases , nor can we ascertain a different theory for the observed fractal dynamics .",
