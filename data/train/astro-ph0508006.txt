    "if we consider a 2-sphere , the geodesics (  straight lines \" ) are the great circles and any two great circles intersect in two places that are known as antipodal points in geography .",
    "there are no parallel geodesics on the sphere , and that is the well - known break - down of the fifth axiom ( or postulate ; see section[secaxioms ] ) of plane geometry ( or euclidean geometry ) . given a pair of antipodal points such as north pole and south pole ,",
    "there are infinitely many geodesics that diverge from one antipodal point and converge to the other .",
    "the antipodal points are the foci of the geodesics .",
    "the 2-sphere ( @xmath0 ) is characterized by a constant gaussian curvature , and gaussian curvature is nothing but the riemann curvature scalar where the non - unity constant between them is just a matter of historical conventions . in two dimensions ,",
    "riemann curvature tensor has only one independent component , and the einstein tensor is given in terms of the riemann curvature scalar and  trivial tensor structure \" built from metric components . for the homogeneous space @xmath0 , the scalar curvature is constant  gauss curvature .",
    "( weinberg , p.144 ; weinberg hereafter )    just for a moment , let s stipulate for the purpose of illustration that the longitudes on @xmath0 are photon paths between a radiation source at the north pole and an observer at the south pole . a image of an object an observer sees in its detector ( say an array of light receptors including counters with @xmath1 efficiency , perfect homogeneity , and infinite resolution ) is a distribution of photons on the detector that last - scattered the object ( the last - scattering surface either of a radiation emission source that generates the photons , or of a reflecting object such as a planet , etc ) whose image the observer seeks .",
    "thus , if we assume that the radiation emission source at the north pole emits photons isotropically , the image of the radiation emission source ( of the radius of a  point \" ) that the observer at the south pole sees in its detector will be a circle ( unless the detector is set exactly at the focal point and is burned ; if the emission is directional such as in lasing , the image will not be a circle because most of the geodesics that connect the source and observer will not be followed by the photons from the  point \" source . )",
    "when the observer visits the north pole , the observer will find through meticulous measurements around the north pole that the radiation source has the size of a  point \" and the shape of the radiating surface is not a circle .",
    "if we allow the observer and source for the third dimension around the north pole for the sake of imagination , the observer will be able to take a mugshot of the radiation surface which will show up as a  point \" in its detector .",
    "in fact , the observer will most likely bring a lab - prepared isotropically emitting  point \" light source to set up at the north pole and confirm that the  point source \" indeed produces a circular image when measured at the south pole .    this dimensional change from a zero - dimensional point source to a one - dimensional circular image results in the point caustic of a spherically symmetric lensing mass in the context of the lens equation as we shall review in the following section",

    "figure[how_fig ] is a depiction of the einstein ring as the critical curve of the single point mass lens @xmath3 .",
    "let s consider the ring , for a moment , as the circle of the two extra images ( and imagine the quadroid centered at @xmath3 ) : the arrow near the point mass lens depicts the motion of the source @xmath86 ; two arrows on the real line depict the images moving on the real line ; two arrows on the ring depict the two extra images that start at one precusp and end at the other precusp .",
    "now take the limit @xmath106 , and one can visualize two images tracing the einstein ring instantaneously at the crossing of the point caustic .    we find the above a comfortable ( usually involving continuity or traceability ) way to think of the transition from two point images to two half - circle images .",
    "the criticality of a lens equation in general is related to formation or disappearance of the two extra images ( or higher even number of images ) . in the case of the single point mass lens ,",
    "the two extra images trace a ring instantaneously forming a ring image due to the degeneracy , and the dimensional change of the linear differential vector spaces of the lens equation is manifested in a global manner .",
    "the exquisite symmetry of the schwarzschild lens ( spherically symmetric matter ) that led to the caustic of degenerate cusp is readily broken in a more general lens , and the caustic is generally a one - dimensional curve as is the critical curve . the lens equation obtained with the small angle approximation is a mapping of the complex plane ( extension of a small neighborhood of the observer s sky where the small angle approximation is valid ) to itself .",
    "the criticality condition @xmath89 imposes one constraint reducing the dimension of the variable space by one .",
    "thus , the critical curve is a one dimensional curve which may be a disjoint sum of many loops , and they are usually smooth .",
    "also , the lens equation is usually smooth almost everywhere except at the poles due to the point mass lens elements ( @xmath101 in the case of the single point mass lens discussed above ) . at the poles , @xmath129 , hence it is reasonable to assume that the lens equation is smooth on the critical curve for gravitational lenses in general .",
    "a smooth curve is mapped to a smooth curve by a smooth mapping except at the stationary points of the mapping .",
    "recall that one of the two eigenvectors vanishes on the critical curve .",
    "if we consider a small deviation @xmath130 from a critical point , dz = dz_+ e_+ + dz_- e_- d= d_+ e_+  , hence @xmath86 changes only in the direction of @xmath131 . now if @xmath132 , then @xmath133",
    "so , if we imagine tracing the critical curve ( or integrating the tangent to the critical curve ) and mapping to draw the caustic curve , the procession of the caustic curve stops momentarily where @xmath132 and turns around .",
    "in other words , the caustic curve develops a cusp where the tangent to the critical curve is parallel to the critical eigenvector @xmath99 . the critical point where the tangent has @xmath132 is called precusp .",
    "thus , the caustic curve of a lens equation is a piecewise smooth curve punctuated by cusps which may be a disjoint sum of cuspy loops that may intersect themselves .",
    "as the point caustic at the lens position of the single lens is defined within the context of the lens equation , the caustic curve of a general gravitational lens is defined only within the context of the lens equation .",
    "we discuss a couple of papers found in the astrophysical journal that may play an unfortunate role of perpetuating misunderstandings .",
    "the paper entitled  superluminal caustics of close , rapidly - rotating binary microlenses \" , zheng zheng and andrew gould , apj 541 ( 2002 ) , 728 , considers the caustic curve of the binary lens equation as an object of the size given by the multiplication of its angular size and distance @xmath134 and of an ( unspecified ) inertia whose velocity has to be compared with the speed of light and be concerned of for its tachyonic nature . as we discussed in this article ,",
    "the caustic is defined only within the context of the lens equation , and especially , it is not an object of an inertia .",
    "there is nothing wrong with thinking of the caustic curve as a large linear object by projecting it to the normal plane passing through the source or passing through the lens , or at any distance along the line of sight if that serves to understand or apply the lens equation for some purpose as far as the contextual existence and characteristics of the caustics as defined within the lens equation are valid .",
    "certainly , inertia is not a quality of the caustics defined in the lens equation ; there does not exist a tachyonic caustic .    if we stipulate for a moment for the purpose of clearing up another conceptual mistake that the caustics be endowed with inertias",
    ", what the caustics can newly acquire is the tachyonic nature but not a superluminal phenomenon known in astrophysics as we discussed in astro - ph/0002414 .",
