    "the discovery of the polarization of starlight ( hall 1949 ; hall & mikesell 1949 ; hiltner 1949a , b ) revealed not only that interstellar dust particles were nonspherical , but that some process had brought about large - scale alignment of these grains .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field was immediately suggested as a grain alignment agent possessing the large - scale coherence required by the polarization observations .",
    "initial investigations considered magnetic processes for bringing about the grain alignment .",
    "both `` compass - needle '' alignment of ferromagnetic grains ( spitzer & schatzman 1949 ; spitzer & tukey 1949 , 1951 ) and paramagnetic dissipation in spinning grains ( davis & greenstein 1949 , 1950a , b , 1951 ) were initially proposed . when hi zeeman splitting ( verschuur 1969 ) and dispersion and faraday rotation toward pulsars ( woltjer 1970 ) indicated interstellar field strengths of 3 - 4@xmath1 g , it was evident that `` compass - needle '' alignment was negligible , but paramagnetic dissipation on the davis - greenstein timescale @xmath2 [ see eq.([eq : t_dg ] ) below ] appeared to be viable , particularly if the grains were superparamagnetic ( jones & spitzer 1967 ) . however , study of the statistical mechanics of grain alignment ( jones & spitzer 1967 ; purcell & spitzer 1971 ) raised questions about the ability of the interstellar magnetic field to achieve the observed degree of grain alignment , since random gas - grain collisions ( and magnetic fluctuations within the grain ) would tend to oppose the alignment process .",
    "martin ( 1971 ) pointed out that because of the rowland effect , charged interstellar grains would have a substantial magnetic moment either parallel or antiparallel to the angular velocity ; this magnetic moment ensured that precession of the grain angular momentum around the magnetic field would be sufficiently rapid that the observed interstellar grain alignment should always be either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , regardless of the mechanism responsible for grain alignment .",
    "thus the galactic magnetic field could lead to large - scale coherence in observed grain alignment , even if the magnetic field itself played no direct role in grain alignment .",
    "this conclusion was reinforced when dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) noted that the barnett effect implied much larger magnetic moments for spinning grains , leading to even more rapid precession of @xmath3 around @xmath4 .",
    "a very important development occurred when purcell ( 1975 , 1979 ) pointed out that grains were subject to systematic torques which , in diffuse clouds , would result in grain rotation rates far in excess of those which had been previously assumed to result from simple thermal excitation by collisions with gas atoms .",
    "purcell considered three sources of systematic torques : @xmath0 formation at preferred sites on the grain surface , photoelectron emission following absorption of a uv photon , and variations in the `` accommodation coefficient '' over the grain surface ; the @xmath0 formation torques appeared to be most important .",
    "purcell observed that if these torques were long - lived , then normal paramagnetic relaxation would gradually bring the grain angular momentum into alignment with the magnetic field .",
    "however , if the grain surface changes on time scales short compared to @xmath2 , substantial grain alignment would not occur .",
    "spitzer & mcglynn ( 1978 ) analyzed the `` crossover '' process when the grain s rotation rate ( in body coordinates ) undergoes a reversal due to a change in sign of the `` purcell torque '' , and obtained an estimate for the disalignment caused by frequent crossovers .",
    "spitzer & mcglynn concluded that if the active sites for @xmath0 formation were short - lived , the disorientation during crossovers was too great for grains to be aligned by ordinary paramagnetic dissipation .",
    "the crossover phenomenon has recently been reanalyzed by lazarian & draine ( 1997 ) , who find that the disalignment per crossover can be ( paradoxically ) substantially suppressed by `` barnett effect fluctuations '' , with the result that paramagnetic alignment could potentially explain the observed alignment of @xmath5 grains , _ if _ no other systematic torques acted to change the grain alignment .    in a previous paper ( draine & weingartner 1996a ; hereinafter paper i )",
    "we found that interstellar starlight exerts very substantial torques on irregular grains .",
    "these `` radiative torques '' drive extreme superthermal rotation in grains with the sizes ( @xmath6 ) which must be aligned to account for the observed interstellar polarization .",
    "in addition , radiative torques can act to change the direction of the grain rotation , and must therefore play a role in the process of grain alignment .",
    "this paper is devoted to a study of this phenomenon .",
    "the grain geometry and coordinate systems are introduced in  [ sec : coords ] . ",
    "[ sec : torques ] discusses the torques acting on the grain due to the barnett effect , gas drag , @xmath0 formation , paramagnetic dissipation , and absorption and scattering of starlight .    in  [ sec : dynamics ]",
    "we obtain the equations of motion after averaging over precession , and we discuss the stationary points and `` crossover points '' allowed by these equations .",
    "`` trajectory maps '' showing the evolution of the grain orientation and rotational velocity are discussed in  [ sec : traj_maps ] , where we show that three different classes of grain behavior are possible .",
    "examples of each of the three classes of trajectory map are presented . in many cases radiative torques , together with magnetic precession of @xmath3 around @xmath4 ,",
    "rapidly bring about alignment of the grain angular momentum @xmath3 with the magnetic field @xmath4 .    in  [ sec :",
    "discuss ] we summarize the behavior of our three exemplary grains as a function of the angle @xmath7 between the magnetic field @xmath4 and the starlight anisotropy direction .",
    "since the surface density of active sites for @xmath0 formation is uncertain , we examine the sensitivity of our results to this quantity , and find that , for likely values , radiative torques are more important than paramagnetic dissipation for producing grain alignment . in some cases",
    "the radiative torques do not allow a stationary solution ; even in this case the average alignment can be substantial .",

    "there are four stationary points , three of which are attractors .",
    "there are two crossover attractors and three crossover repellors .",
    "this is a noncyclic map , but which of the three stationary attractors the grain is captured by depends on the initial conditions and ( for trajectories which pass through the crossover attractor at @xmath165 ) on the details of the crossover process , which will determine which trajectories emerging from the crossover attractor are populated .",
    "it is by now evident that radiative torques lead to complex grain dynamics , which depend delicately on the grain geometry , the angle @xmath7 between the starlight anisotropy and the magnetic field @xmath4 , and on the @xmath0 formation torque to which the grain is subject .      above",
    "we have shown 6 examples of trajectory maps , but these are obviously a very incomplete sampling of parameter space . to provide a more global picture of the grain dynamics , figures [ fig : omega.g1][fig : omega.g3 ] show the `` terminal '' values of the grain rotation rate @xmath127 and @xmath171 .",
    "the domains of noncylic , cyclic , and semicyclic solutions are indicated .",
    "the region labelled `` noncyclic ? ''",
    "is where there is at least one stationary attractor , and there are crossover attractors of opposite polarity , but where each opposite polarity pair of crossover attractors has an intervening crossover repellor . as discussed above , we suspect that such cases are noncyclic , but we have not verified this in all cases .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : omega.g1][fig : omega.g3 ] the horizontal broken lines show the values of @xmath172 corresponding to alignment parameter @xmath173 . solutions with @xmath174 are `` antialigned '' , with @xmath175 , but it is apparent that antialigned stationary solutions are relatively rare .",

    "[ fig : omega.g1 ] shows that for @xmath176 and @xmath143 , shape 1 is antialigned only for @xmath177 ; even in this case the antialignment is minimal and there are competing stationary solutions with substantial alignment .    from visual inspection of figures [ fig : omega.g1][fig : omega.g3 ] , we conclude that in a substantial fraction of cases , the grains have noncyclic trajectory maps with stationary solutions with appreciable , and often perfect , alignment .",
    "the numerical examples considered above assume the characteristic separation between @xmath0 formation sites to be @xmath65 , with the @xmath0 formation torque given by eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma_h2 ] with @xmath178 .",
    "it is quite possible that the surface density of active sites is lower ( @xmath179 ) , in which case the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath0 torque will be larger . to explore this , we consider shape 3 with @xmath180 . in figure",
    "[ fig : omega.g3p3510 ] we show the stationary solutions for @xmath181 .",
    "for @xmath182 the @xmath0 formation torque dominates the grain spinup , and we no longer have cyclic trajectories ( all crossovers have the same polarity ) .",
    "however , we still have multiple stationary points in many cases .",
    "the values of @xmath183 for these cases do not appear to be very sensitive to the value of @xmath184 .",
    "furthermore , even though the @xmath0 formation torques may dominate radiative torques in driving superthermal rotation , radiative torques may still be more important than davis - greenstein torques in bringing about alignment of the grain angular momentum with @xmath4 .",
    "this is evident in figure [ fig : talign ] , showing the alignment time as a function of @xmath64 for @xmath160 .",
    "since the davis - greenstein torque is proportional to @xmath127 , in the limit of large @xmath64 the alignment time approaches the davis - greenstein alignment time .",
    "however , if the active sites for @xmath0 formation are characterized by @xmath185 ( i.e. , @xmath186 active site per @xmath187 ) then radiative torques apparently dominate the grain alignment process .",
    "when the trajectory map shows cyclic behavior , the degree of grain alignment will depend on what fraction of the time the grain spends with different values of @xmath30 .",
    "suppose we have two crossover attractors , at @xmath188 and @xmath189 , with polarities @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "consider a trajectory beginning near @xmath188 , at @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the total time to reach the next crossover is t = _ _ c1+^_c2 d ( d / dt)^-1  .",
    "the fraction @xmath194 of the time spent in an interval @xmath195 is given by = 1t|d / dt|  .",
    "in figure [ fig : dpdcosxi ] we show the distribution computed for 6 trajectories for grain shape 1 and @xmath159 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_30.g1p ] ) .",
    "the upper panel shows four trajectories emerging from the crossover attractor at @xmath149 ; the lower panel is for two trajectories emerging from the crossover attractor at @xmath148 . for each trajectory",
    "we compute the time - averaged alignment factor r = _",
    "-1 ^ 1 d r ( )  .",
    "we see that quite different values of @xmath167 are found for the different trajectories , but in this case at least there is a tendency for the average alignment @xmath167 to be positive .",
    "thus , although we are not yet able to predict which trajectory ( or distribution of trajectories ) will be taken by grains emerging from the crossover attractors , there is at least an indication that even cyclic behavior of the kind shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_30.g1p ] may result in significant grain alignment .",
    "the present paper is an exploratory study of the role of starlight torques in the dynamics and alignment of interstellar grains .",
    "three grain geometries have been studied , but for only one size , @xmath90 .",
    "the important role of starlight torques has been demonstrated , and we conclude that @xmath6 grains can often be effectively aligned with the magnetic field @xmath4 by this process .",
    "a number of issues remain to be investigated :    1 .",
    "it is important to examine the dependence of this mechanism on the grain size . in paper i",
    "we showed that radiative torques are relatively unimportant for @xmath196 grains with the geometry of shape 1 ; based on those results it seems likely that radiative torques will not be able to produce alignment of @xmath197 grains , but future work should examine the dependence on grain size in greater detail , with the important goal of understanding the observed minimal alignment of grains with @xmath197 ( kim & martin 1995 ) .",
    "the present study has been restricted to the dielectric function of silicate material .",
    "it will be of interest to determine whether other grain materials , e.g. , graphite , will behave similarly .",
    "we have not attempted to examine the grain dynamics when the rate of rotation approaches `` thermal '' values during the `` crossover '' process .",
    "a detailed study of the crossover process is essential for understanding the fate of grains having cyclic or semicyclic trajectory maps .",
    "these issues will be addressed in future investigations .",
    "our principal results are as follows :    1 .",
    "as anticipated in paper i , anisotropic starlight incident on an interstellar grain produces a torque which , in addition to spinning the grain up to superthermal rotation rates , directly affects the orientation of the grain relative to both the anisotropy direction and the direction of the local magnetic field @xmath4 . accordingly , previous studies of grain alignment , which neglected these torques , are incomplete .",
    "2 .   we obtain equations of motion for the grain which are valid in the limit where the grain rotation period and the precession period are both short compared to the timescale for the grain to change its angular velocity and orientation relative to the magnetic field .",
    "the equations of motion have been integrated for three different grains and many different initial conditions . for a given grain and a given angle @xmath7 between the radiation anisotropy direction and @xmath4",
    ", we produce a `` trajectory map '' which shows how the grain will evolve under the combined effects of starlight , @xmath0 formation torques , gas drag , and paramagnetic dissipation ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tr_00.g1z][fig : tr_00.g3p ] ) .",
    "4 .   under some conditions",
    "the trajectory maps contain a `` stationary attractor '' ; trajectories coming near this point are permanenty captured .",
    "the stationary attractor often ( but not always ) corresponds to a state of perfect alignment of the grain angular momentum @xmath3 with the magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "5 .   the trajectory map may contain one or more `` crossover attractors '' where ( formally ) the grain rotation may reverse .",
    "unfortunately , the assumptions underlying our dynamical study break down near such crossover points , and the present study is unable to describe the dynamical evolution of the grain near the crossover point .",
    "trajectory maps can be classified as `` noncyclic '' , `` cyclic '' , and `` semicyclic '' , based upon whether or not there are stationary attractors , and upon the locations and polarities of crossover attractors , and the locations of crossover repellors .",
    "7 .   in diffuse clouds , for grains with effective radii @xmath198",
    ", these starlight torques dominate the grain dynamics , if the separation between active sites for @xmath0 formation is @xmath199 .",
    "even when @xmath0 torques dominate the grain spinup ( @xmath200 ) the radiation torques dominate the grain alignment process for @xmath185 .",
    "8 .   based on study of three grain geometries",
    ", we conclude that radiative torques due to anisotropic starlight appear to be the primary mechanism responsible for the observed alignment of interstellar dust grains .",
