    "hydromagnetic dynamos can be understood as magnetic instabilities driven by a special flow pattern in fluid conductors .",
    "there are , however , strong restrictions on the characteristics of such flows ( see dudley & james 1989 ) as well as on the geometry of the resulting magnetic fields @xcite . the restrictions even exclude any dynamo activity for a number of flows .",
    "we mention as an example that differential rotation alone can never maintain a dynamo ( elsasser 1946 ) .",
    "an open question is whether magnetic instabilities are able to excite a sufficiently complicated motion that together with a ( given ) background flow can generate magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite suggested that nonuniformly rotating disks can produce a dynamo when magnetorotational ( mri ) and magnetic buoyancy instabilities are active .",
    "later on , numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite have shown that mri alone may be sufficient for the accretion disk dynamo .",
    "it remains , however , to check ( at least for the case of low magnetic prandtl number ) whether the mri - dynamo has physical or numerical origin @xcite .",
    "another possibility was discussed by @xcite who suggested that differential rotation and magnetic kink - type instability @xcite can jointly drive a dynamo in stellar radiation zones .",
    "the dynamo if real would be very important for the angular momentum transport in stars and their secular evolution .",
    "it taps energy from differential rotation thus reducing the rotational shear .",
    "radial displacements converting toroidal magnetic field into poloidal field are necessary for the dynamo .",
    "the dynamo , therefore , unavoidably mixes chemical species in stellar interiors that may have observable consequences for stellar evolution .",
    "such a dynamo , however , has not yet been demonstrated to exist .",
    "the doubts especially concern the kink - type instability that in contrast to mri exists also without differential rotation .",
    "the tayler instability develops in expense of magnetic energy .",
    "estimations of dynamo parameters are thus necessary to assess the dynamo - effectiveness of this magnetic instability .",
    "the basic role in turbulent dynamos plays the ability of correlated magnetic ( @xmath3 ) fluctuations and velocity ( @xmath4 ) fluctuations to produce a mean electromotive force along the background magnetic field @xmath5 and also along the electric current @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 we estimate the @xmath0 effect by tayler instability in the present paper .",
    "we do also find indications for the appearance of the turbulent diffusivity @xmath8 in the calculations but we do not follow them here in detail . for purely toroidal fields we did _ not _ find indication for the existence of the term @xmath9 which can appear in the expression ( [ 1 ] ) in form of a rotationally induced anisotropy of the diffusivity tensor .",
    "the fluctuating fields for the most rapidly growing eigenmodes and the azimuthal averaging are applied in the lhs of eq.([1 ] ) to estimate the @xmath0 effect and its relation to the kinetic and magnetic helicity @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "our linear stability computations do not allow the evaluation of the @xmath0 effect amplitude but its latitudinal profile and its ratio to the product of rms values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( i.e. the correlation coefficient ) can be found . as the differential rotation is necessary for dynamo",
    ", we estimate also the influence of differential rotation on tayler instability .",
    "next , a dynamo model with the parameters estimated for the magnetic instability is designed to find the global modes of the instability - driven dynamo .",
    "the model and the stability analysis of this paper are very close to that of @xcite and will be discussed here only briefly .    the basic component of the magnetic field inside a star is normally assumed to be the toroidal one",
    ". this toroidal field can be produced by differential rotation from even a small poloidal field .",
    "the background toroidal field of our model consists of two latitudinal belts of opposite polarities , i.e. @xmath14 ( see spruit 1999 ) with @xmath15 as the alfvn frequency of the toroidal field .",
    "spherical coordinates are used with the axis of rotation as the polar axis and @xmath16 as the azimuthal unit vector .",
    "the latitudinal profile of ( [ 2 ] ) peaks in mid - latitudes at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the background flow is simply @xmath19 with @xmath20 as the equatorial rotation rate .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath20 are radius - dependent but this dependence is not of basic importance for the stability analysis .",
    "the reason is that the stratification of the radiative core is stable with positive @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the entropy and @xmath23 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "the buoyancy frequency @xmath24 is large compared to @xmath20 ( @xmath25 in the upper radiative core of the sun ) .",
    "then the radial scale of unstable disturbances is short and the dependence of the disturbances on radius can be treated in a local approximation , i.e. in the form of @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter controlling the stratification influence on the instability is @xmath27 and the most unstable disturbances have @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this means that the radial scale of the disturbances , @xmath29 , is short compared to the radial scale @xmath30 of toroidal field or angular velocity variations . in the solar tachocline where @xmath20 strongly varies in radius ,",
    "the scale ratio is smaller than unity , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "for such small scale ratio the radial derivatives in the linear stability equations are absorbed by the disturbances so that the local approximation in the radial coordinate can be applied .",

    "the thermal diffusion is especially important because of its destabilizing effect .",
    "the tayler instability requires radial displacements . it does not exist in 2d case of strictly horizontal motion .",
    "the radial displacements in radiation zones are opposed by buoyancy .",

    "it means that for every unstable mode with finite helicity there is another unstable mode with the same growth and drift rates but with opposite helicity so that the resulting net helicity should vanish .",
    "obviously , if all modes are excited the instability of a purely toroidal axisymmetric field can not produce finite values of the kinetic helicity .",

    "this factor is of the order @xmath84 .    for the latitudinal profile of the radial field component the simplest choice , i.e. @xmath85 , is used .",

    "the concentration of helicity and emf towards the poles reflects a basic property of the tayler instability , i.e. that the instability pattern is more present in polar regions rather than in equatorial regions ( spruit 1999 ; cally 2003 ) .",

    "it is demonstrated with a linear theory that the tayler instability of a toroidal magnetic field in a density - stratified radiation zone of hot stars does not produce helicity and/or @xmath0 effect .",

    "if @xmath209 is _ positive _ in the northern hemisphere then the helicity @xmath210 is _ negative _ at the northern hemisphere if only the modes are considered which grow fastest .",
    "hence , the small - scale kinetic helicity and the large - scale current helicity of the background field are anticorrelated .",
    "as it is often the case , the corresponding @xmath0 effect is anticorrelated with the kinetic helicity and , therefore , positively correlated with the large - scale current helicity @xmath209 .",

    "the first property excludes the existence of @xmath1 dynamos in radiative zones and the second property makes the existence of @xmath2 dynamos ( with weak differential rotation in mid - latitudes ) unlikely . as we have shown only a dynamo with @xmath200 produces the toroidal fields in mid - latitudes . for @xmath202 , however , the belts are more and more shifted into the polar region .",
    "such fields can not close the loop of field amplification by reproducing the original axisymmetric toroidal field .    or",
    ", with other words , the rotation law with the considered profile ( @xmath211 ) mainly induces toroidal fields at mid - latitudes where for high values of @xmath189 almost no @xmath0 effect exists .",
    "hence , an @xmath2 dynamo could only work for very fast rotation . by very fast rotation",
    "the instability is suppressed ( see fig .",
    "this topological problem seems to be the key problem with the magnetic - driven dynamo rather than the excitation conditions for @xmath2 dynamos .",
    "it is , however , not yet clear whether this argumentation also holds with the same power with other than the used rotation laws and/or in fully nonlinear simulations .",
    "all the presented @xmath2 dynamo models working with a weak solar - type differential rotation are reproducing the assumed sign of the large - scale current helicity @xmath88 .",
    "if thus the dynamo produces its own @xmath0 effect by the magnetic instability then the signs will be consistent .",
    "a basic deficit of the presented theory is the fact that both helicity and @xmath0 effect have been computed in rigidly rotating stars while for an @xmath2 dynamo the rotation must be nonrigid",
    ". it might be the case that growth rates and magnetic patterns of the tayler instability are strongly modified by even weak differential rotation .",
    "the discussion of this new subject , however , is not the scope of the present paper .",
    "we have thus considered only cases with a rather weak differential rotation ( 3 % ) .",
    "another deficit is formed by the order - of - magnitude estimation of the eddy diffusivity . using the characteristic scales of the modes with the highest growth rates the typical velocity is of order 1 mm / s and the typical diffusivity value is about @xmath212 @xmath149/s ( both for solar values ) .",
    "estimations of the radial mixing produced by the same instability provide an important test of the theory .",
    "the observed content of light elements at the sun impose restrictions on radial mixing in the upper radiative core ( barnes et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the chemical mixing in the deep stellar interior can also be compatible with observations only if its characteristic time is longer than the evolutionary time scale @xcite .",
    "only very slightly supercritical kink - type instability can satisfy this restriction @xcite .",
    "all the material values in the paper are solar values .",
    "the formulation of the dynamo theory is such that the material parameters of the stellar interior do not appear ( see eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) ) .",
    "the conclusions about the dynamo activity for hot stars do thus not depend on the mass of the star .",
    "this is not true , however , for the above mentioned order - of - magnitude estimations of the characteristic values of velocity and diffusivity which are running with @xmath171 and @xmath213 , resp . from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] one finds that the given solar values increase by factors of 30 or 900 , resp .",
    ", for stars with three solar masses .",
    "only nonlinear simulations can demonstrate whether the system indeed prefers the modes with the highest growth rates . only if not then the radiative - zone dynamo has a chance to work in the solar interior but if it works then it should be only marginally supercritical .",
