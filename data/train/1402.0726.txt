    "in @xcite we have introduced the generalization of the skyrmion model for the baryon .",
    "the idea was to take into account the infinite tower of the vector and axial mesons and the chiral condensate simultaneously .",
    "these data are most effectively packed into the 5-dimensional holographic model for qcd @xcite in the curved geometry .",
    "the expansion of 5d gauge fields with @xmath0 gauge group into kaluza - klein modes yields the whole tower of the massive mesons while the chiral condensate is encoded in the boundary condition for the bifundamental scalar .",
    "the conventional skyrmion is just the solitonic configuration built from the pions only however there were some attempts to include the vector mesons into the solution ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "in particular the stabilization of the skyrmion via the @xmath1 - mesons has been suggested @xcite which substitutes the skyrme term mechanism .",
    "more recently the skyrmion has been discussed in 5d model in the flat space and it was found that the vector and axial mesons strongly influence the skyrmion solution @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we found the generalization of the skyrmion solution with highly nontrivial role of the whole tower of the axial and vector mesons .",
    "there was longstanding puzzle concerning the role of the qcd chiral condensate in the baryon mass generation .",
    "this subject was triggered by the sum rule calculation of the baryon mass @xcite resulted in the following surprising formula [ form_ioffe ] m^3 = -8 ^2 |qq , which is valid with reasonable accuracy .",
    "it implies that the huge amount of the baryon mass is due to the chiral condensate .",
    "it was suggested that the naive formula [ linear ] m_b= m_0 + ( |qq ) , where @xmath2 is condensate independent , well interpolates the physics . the similar formula has been also used in the parity - doublet model and the chiral quark - soliton model ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the conventional skyrmion was identified as the instanton solution at the 4d slice of the 5d ads - like space @xcite where the holographic rg coordinate plays the role of the euclidean time direction .",
    "it can be also considered along the atiyah - manton picture @xcite as the instanton trapped by the domain wall localized in the holographic coordinate .",
    "the holographic perspective suggests the proper generalization of the instanton solution which would take into account the massive mesons and chiral condensate .",
    "it is similar to the dyonic instanton solution found in @xcite in the 5d susy gauge theory . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the solution of the dyonic instanton type exists at the particular choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "it has strong similarity with the atiyah - manton picture of the domain wall localized at the holographic coordinate .",
    "the numerical solution to the equations of motion were found in @xcite and it was demonstrated analytically that it carries one unit of the baryon charge .",
    "its stabilization is dictated by the chiral condensate and the confinement scale .",
    "remarkably our dyonic instanton solution yields the elegant solution to the longstanding puzzle concerning the origin of the ioffe s formula ( [ form_ioffe ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate has two branches . at small values of the condensate",
    "the mass is condensate independent while above some critical value it grows according to the ioffe s formula .",
    "the analysis shows that the nature somehow dynamically selects the value of the condensate just at the intersection of two branches .",
    "therefore we have the natural explanation of the ioffe s formula while at small values of the condensate the baryon mass becomes almost condensate independent .",
    "the similarities between dyonic instanton in five - dimensional @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills theory and holographic qcd model become apparent if one examines the problem from the brane - picture point of view .",
    "one can consider the supersymmetric yang - mills with the gauge group @xmath4 as a theory realized by the massless modes of open strings on the worldvolume of the stack of n d4-branes in iib superstring theory .",
    "the breaking of the gauge symmetry is realized via separation of the branes in the transverse coordinate ( see fig .",
    "[ d4branes ] ) .",
    "the value of this separation is in one - to - one correspondence with the the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar field which brakes the symmetry in the field - theoretic formulation .",
    "the gauge bosons associated with the broken symmetry acquire mass proportional to the separation scale . in this picture",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for the su(2 ) gauge group the dyonic instanton is realized as a pair of d0 branes , which are located on the separated d4 branes , and an electrically charged f1 string , which is stretched between them .",
    "being proportional to the length of the f1 string , the mass of the instanton is determined by the vev of the scalar field .",
    "furthermore , for topological charges larger then one this construction is found to be unstable to the formation of the tubular d2 brane out of f1 string . in this case",
    "the instanton assumes the form of the monopole ring , whose radius is stabilized by the angular momentum .",
    "the very similar setup can be found in the holographic models of qcd . in sakai - sugimoto model @xcite the gauge sector of qcd is represented by the massless open string modes on the stack of @xmath5 d4 `` color '' branes , compactified in one spacial direction in order to break supersymmetry .",
    "the quarks are represented by the two additional stacks of @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 `` flavor '' branes .",
    "the embedding of these branes in the 10-dimensional space is described by their position in the compactified dimension and the distance to the stack of d4 `` color '' branes and has the cigar - shaped form ( see fig.[cigar ] ) , so that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 branes join at particular distance from the `` color '' branes . as the chan - paton factors of the string connecting @xmath7 and @xmath8 `` flavor '' branes belong to the fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of the flavor @xmath9 group , the chiral symmetry breaking operator @xmath10 is naturally described by this type of open string @xcite . from the point of view of the theory on the stack of `` color '' branes the sakai - sugimoto model describes @xmath11 nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory with @xmath6 flavors of fundamental quarks and the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking therein .",
    "this theory lives effectively on the four - dimensional intersection of the `` color '' and `` flavor '' branes . integrating out the compactified directions of the bulk space and implementing the ads / cft duality one can obtain from this setup the usual chiral perturbation theory lagrangian supplemented with the interactions of pions with the whole tower of vector and axial - vector mesons @xcite .    in sakai - sugimoto model",
    "we find the situation similar to the one described above .",
    "the chiral symmetry is broken and the symmetry breaking scale @xmath12 is defined by the separation of d8 branes . in the case of @xmath13",
    "the pair of d4 branes can be formed in the worldvolume of the respected d8 branes , similarly to the d0 branes on the d4 stack in the case of dyonic instanton .",
    "these d4 branes fill the compactified directions of the bulk space and look as an instanton from the point of view of the theory on the stack of @xmath5 `` color '' branes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the instanton solutions , which possess nonzero topological charge , can be shown to describe baryons upon ads / cft duality @xcite .",
    "the f1 string stretched between @xmath7 and @xmath8 branes , which is dual to the @xmath12 operator , is trapped by these instantons .",
    "this mechanism prevents the fall of the string to the tip of `` the cigar '' thus preventing its shrinking , which is the well - known problem in sakai - sugimoto model @xcite .",
    "therefore in our investigation the baryon physics described by the instantonic branes is tightly related to the chiral physics described by the f1 string and this relation provides the stabilization mechanism of the solution .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the dyonic instanton and holographic baryon have much in common .",
    "to proceed further and construct the baryonic solution in the holographic qcd model taking the similarities mentioned above as a guideline we chose the simple five - dimensional `` hard - wall '' model @xcite .",
    "this model can be considered as a somewhat simplified result of the integration of all the dynamics of the sakai - sugimoto model along the compactified spacial directions , which leaves only lowest lying string modes propagating in 5-dimensional ads - space with an additional cut off at particular scale @xmath14 : @xmath15 the field content of the model includes two gauge fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the adjoint representation of the flavor group @xmath18 dual to the left and right quark currents , respectively .",
    "these fields in the brane picture are identified with the lowest lying modes of the open stings , which have two ends attached to the flavor d8 branes .",
    "their vector and axial linear combinations will describe the full towers of vector and axial mesons in the model .",
    "another field is a bifundamental scalar @xmath19 which is dual to the quark bilinear operator @xmath20 .",
    "it is the tachionic mode of the string stretched between @xmath7 and @xmath8 branes as discussed above .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the operator @xmath20 is a chiral condensate .",
    "hence by the duality argument @xcite the classical profile of the scalar field @xmath21 is proportional to this symmetry breaking scale . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath22 .",
    "the action reads as ( we use the notation of citekrik1,krik2,tensor ) @xmath23 where the covariant derivative is @xmath24 .",
    "the constants in the action can be fixed by matching the two - point functions calculated in the holographic model to the leading terms in the sum rule approach @xcite : @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "apart of the yang - mills part of the action one needs to consider the chern - simons part , which is @xmath27 here we mark with a hat the abelian ( related to the cartan subalgebra of @xmath18 ) parts of the gauge fields .",
    "one should recall @xcite that as the abelian part of the gauge field is dual to the @xmath28 quark current , the vector combination @xmath29 is dual to the baryon number current .",
    "one can see from ( [ cs ] ) that the source for the temporal component of the baryon current  the baryon charge  is @xmath30.\\ ] ] this is identified with the difference between four - dimensional topological charges of the left and right nonabelian field configuration in the constant time slice . thus in order to describe the baryon we need to find the solution to the equations of motion of the model which has nontrivial topological charge  the instanton .    in the following we use the ansatz similar to the witten cylindric ansatz @xcite with the holographic coordinate @xmath31 along the axis of the cylinder and the spacial radius @xmath32 in the slice of constant @xmath31 .",
    "now the model can be rewritten in terms of two - dimensional fields : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the generators of @xmath35 obeying the commutation relation @xmath36 = - i \\epsilon^{abc } \\tau^c$ ] .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to introduce the phases of the complex combinations of the scalar fields @xmath37 studying the equations of motion on the boundaries we find , that the equation for the modulus @xmath38 is always satisfied by @xmath39 this is the consequence of the fact that the field @xmath21 is holographically dual to the quark bilinear operator @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the form of the solution is dictated by the canonical dimension @xmath41 of this operator : one branch behaves as @xmath42 and the other as @xmath43 .",
    "the two dimensional coefficients are related to the source of the operator ( which is for @xmath40 the quark mass @xmath44 ) and the vacuum expectation value @xmath45 , namely the quark condensate .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is related to the quark condensate as @xcite @xmath47 in what follows we study the chiral limit @xmath48 .",
    "the energy functional of the model that we get by substituting [ ansatz ] and [ phases ] into the action [ action ] contains several potential terms .",
    "one of them is @xmath49.\\ ] ] since this potential is positively definite , the lowest energy solution is defined by the two terms separately .",
    "the first leads to @xmath50 , the second  to either @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "next , the other potential term is @xmath54.\\ ] ] and consequently in the vacuum state either @xmath55 and @xmath56 or @xmath57 and @xmath58 hence the vacuum state of our model is described by two quantum numbers : @xmath59 and @xmath44 , which identify the values of phases @xmath1 and @xmath60 . in order to describe the solution with nonzero topological charge we need to choose different vacuum states at different boundaries of the 4d ads slice , thus realizing the instanton - like tunneling process .",
    "one way of doing this is to consider constant phase @xmath61 and singular behavior of the scalar modulus @xmath62 at the @xmath63 boundary @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the scalar field vanishes at the point @xmath64 at asymptotical infinity , what allows for the kink - like behavior of the phase @xmath1 is @xmath31 direction .",
    "hence the solution obtained in this way is a domain wall placed in the holographic direction parallel to the boundary of @xmath65 .",
    "the field strength created on the boundary by the instanton trapped by this wall translates directly to the skyrmion - like field configuration on the dual theory .",
    "the realization of the skyrmion as an instanton on the domain wall was proposed in @xcite and this solution generalizes this idea to the holographic qcd model .",
    "the other way of realizing soliton in this model was elaborated in @xcite .",
    "it is more general then the previous one and is free from the singular points . in order to get nonzero baryon charge without demanding for the vanishing of the scalar field one needs to consider simultaneous change of the phase @xmath1 along the @xmath32 direction and the phase @xmath60 along the @xmath31 direction . taking the values presented in table [ table1 ]",
    "one can show , that the baryon charge ( [ baryon ] ) on this solution is defined by the boundary conditions and is equal to one .",
    ".[table1 ] the boundary values for the phases ( [ phases ] ) , which describe the solution with unit baryon charge .",
    "the phase @xmath66 is set to @xmath67 by residual gauge symmetry . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can also observe that the field @xmath21 in this solution behaves exactly the same as the chiral field @xmath68 in the `` hedgehog '' skyrmion .    the solution with asymptotic values of phases described above can be studied numerically .",
    "interestingly enough the solution tend to shrink in the @xmath31 direction and expand in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "that means it looks more or less as a thin disk ( see fig .",
    "[ disk ] ) .",
    "this form reminds us of the domain - wall solution considered in the previous case @xcite .",
    "thus the present solution preserves the analogy with the picture of the skyrmion trapped on the domain wall @xcite .",
    "even more interesting is the behavior of the optimal coordinates of the solution , which describe the position of the domain wall in the @xmath31 direction and the size of the instanton .",
    "we find , that for large values of @xmath46 the optimal position of the instanton is located somewhere between ir and uv boundaries of the bulk space .",
    "this is in contrast with the usual behavior of the instanton solutions in @xmath65 @xcite , which tend to fall on the ir boundary . in our treatment",
    "we find , that the chiral condensate provides a counter force , which drives the solution from ir boundary into the bulk .",
    "this result is directly related to the fact that the instantons on the @xmath7 branes prevent the f1 string to shrink in the sakai - sugimoto picture discussed above .",
    "our treatment shows that the chiral condensate and the related bifundamental field @xmath21 play the important role of stabilizing the position and the size of the instanton solution , which we consider in this work .",
    "this points to the fundamental relation between baryon and chiral physics in qcd .",
    "the fact that the chiral condensate governs the @xmath31 position of the solution and the energy of the solution that is the mass of the baryon suggests to study the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate in our model . on fig .",
    "[ masses ] we plot the energy ( mass ) of the optimal solution with respect to the cube root of @xmath46 , everything normalized to the position of the ir boundary @xmath14 .",
    "we see that for small @xmath46 the energy does not change since the solution lyes just on the ir boundary , but for larger @xmath46 the solution detaches from the boundary and the mass start to grow with the chiral condensate .",
    "the striking feature of this plot is the obviously linear dependence of the baryon mass on the energy scale of the condensate .",
    "this fits with the ioffe s formula with the additional constant term @xcite @xmath69.\\ ] ] we find the approximate value @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where the normalization ( [ sigma ] ) is used .",
    "this formula underestimates the mass of the physical baryon by the factor of 3 and this effect may be attributed to the uncertainties in the parameter values in the `` hard - wall '' model or to the oversimplification of the bulk metric and the @xmath13 approximation . nevertheless , we stress the linear dependence observed in ( [ result ] ) , which is in qualitative agreement with the relations ( [ form_ioffe ] ) , ( [ linear ] ) .",
    "it provides the very interesting resolution of the longstanding puzzle concerning the origin of the ioffe s formula . and points out the important interplay between the chiral and baryonic physics in qcd .",
    "the dyonic instanton realization of the baryon provides us with a new tool to take into account the chiral symmetry breaking effects in the baryon physics .",
    "certainly it is very important in many aspects and much more detailed investigation of the generalized skyrmion is required beyond the oversimplified hard - wall model .",
    "however even within the hard - wall model one could answer an interesting questions .",
    "for instance one could consider the formfactors of the generalized skyrmion , study the spacial variations of the chiral condensate value inside the solution and look for the geometry of the solutions with higher baryon charges .",
