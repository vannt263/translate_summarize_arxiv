    "the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on the nucleons and nuclei has been since early seventies the powerful tool for investigation of the nucleon internal structure and simultaneously has served as an crucial test of the related theory - qcd . for recent results in this field",
    "see e.g. @xcite and citations therein .",
    "the quark - parton model ( qpm ) , motivated by the experimental data , is extraordinarily simple if formulated in the reference system in which the nucleon is fast moving ( infinite momentum frame - imf ) .",
    "namely in this system the bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 can be approximately identified with the momentum fraction of the nucleon carried by a parton and experimentally measured structure functions can be easily related to the combinations of distribution functions expressed in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution functions extracted from the experimental data by the global analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) relying on qpm+qcd represent basic elements of the present picture of nucleons and other hadrons .",
    "in this paper we attempt to cope with the not only aesthetic drawback of qpm which in the standard formulation has a good sense only in the _ preferred _ reference system - imf .",
    "the idea of alternatives to the qpm postulated in imf is not new , the possibility to obtain in some approximation the structure and distribution functions from a definite parton model formulated in the nucleon rest frame has been shown e.g. in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and recently @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we suggest rather a consistent modification of the general standard formulation which does not adhere necessarily to imf and simultaneously does not require any special assumptions in addition .",
    "the basis of our considerations are only kinematics and mathematics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    "the basic kinematic quantities related to the dis are introduced and particularly the meaning of variable @xmath0 is discussed . in the sec.3 we formally apply the standard assumptions of the qpm to the nucleon in its rest system ( lab ) and compare the results with those normally related to the imf .",
    "the sec.4 is devoted to the discussion from more physical point of view together with the glance at experimental data on proton structure function @xmath1 .",
    "the last section shortly summarizes the possible conclusions .",
    "first of all let us recall some basic notions used in the description of dis and the interpretation of the experimental data on the basis of qpm .",
    "the process is usually described ( see fig.[fg1 ] ) by the variables @xmath2    as a rule , lepton mass is neglected , i.e. @xmath3 . important assumption of qpm is that struck parton remains on - shell , that implies    @xmath4    bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 can be interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the parton in the nucleon infinite momentum frame ( imf ) . the motivation of this statement can be explained as follows .",
    "let us denote    @xmath5    fourmometa of the parton , nucleon and exchanged photon in the nucleon rest system ( lab ) .",
    "the lorentz boost to the imf ( in the direction of collision axis ) gives    @xmath6    where for @xmath7    @xmath8",
    "if we denote    @xmath9    then one can write    @xmath10    now let the lepton has initial momentum @xmath11 . if we denote @xmath12 and @xmath13 then @xmath14 and from eqs .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) , ( [ k2 ] ) it follows    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the parton and photon transversal momenta .",
    "obviously    @xmath17    @xmath18    using this relation the eq.([k8 ] ) can be modified    @xmath19    therefore if the lepton energy is sufficiently high , so @xmath20 , one can write    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the angle between the parton and photon momenta in the transversal plane .    so , if parton transversal momenta are neglected , @xmath0 really represents fraction of momentum ( [ k6 ] ) . in a higher approximation",
    "the experimentally measured @xmath0 being an integral over @xmath22 is effectively smeared with respect to the fraction @xmath23 which is not correlated with @xmath24 an estimation of the second term in the last equation can be done as follows .",
    "because    @xmath25    @xmath26    then ( [ ka10 ] ) , ( [ kb10 ] ) give    @xmath27    therefore for @xmath28 we obtain    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    therefore @xmath0 can be at sufficiently high @xmath31 considered as a good approximation of @xmath32 ( and vice versa ) , on the end of next section we shall suggest how to treat this correction more accurately .",
    "let us note , the parameter @xmath32 ( [ k6 ] ) can be expressed also as @xmath33 and identified with light cone variable , which can be expressed also in terms of rapidity and transversal mass    @xmath34    where @xmath35 denotes the proton rapidity . in this form",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is invariant with respect to any lorentz boost along the collision axis .",
    "now , if we assume parton phase space is spherical ( in lab ) and rather idealized scenario in which the parton has a mass @xmath36 , then further relations can be obtained .",
    "\\1 ) _ variable x _    from eq.([k6 ] ) and the condition @xmath37 it can be shown    @xmath38    @xmath39    obviously , the highest value of @xmath40 is reached if @xmath41 and @xmath42 which gives @xmath43 then spherical symmetry implies @xmath44 i.e. the first relation in ( [ k12 ] ) is proved . apparently , the minimal value of @xmath32 is reached for @xmath45 and @xmath41 . after inserting to ( [ k6 ] ) one",
    "gets ( [ k11 ] ) .",
    "finally , the relation ( [ k6 ] ) implies @xmath46 which inserted to modified relation ( [ kc12 ] ) @xmath47 after some computation gives the second relation in ( [ k12 ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) _ variable _",
    "@xmath0    let us express @xmath0 in the lab    @xmath48    and estimate its minimal value . with the use of ( [ kb10 ] )",
    "we obtain    @xmath49    since @xmath50 and    @xmath51    relation ( [ k15 ] ) can be rewritten    @xmath52    i.e. for @xmath53 lower limit of @xmath0 coincides with the limit ( [ k11 ] ) .",
    "in this section we imagine partons as a gas ( or a mixture of gases ) of quasi free particles filling up the nucleon volume .",
    "the prefix _ quasi _ means that partons bounded inside the nucleon behave at the interaction with external photon probing the nucleon as free particles having the fourmomenta on mass shell .",
    "this is standard assumption of qpm , but whereas in the imf parton masses are  hidden ",
    ", in the description related to the lab the masses will be present .    in the next section we shall discuss in which extent the results obtained for this idealized picture",
    "could be applied for more realistic scenario .",
    "let us suppose @xmath54 is the distribution function of some sort of partons given in terms of variable @xmath32 ( @xmath55 and these partons are assumed to have the mass @xmath56 . if the spherical symmetry is assumed in the hadron rest system and @xmath57 is the number of partons in the element of the phase space , then the distribution function @xmath54 can be expressed as the convolution    @xmath58    using the set of integral variables @xmath59 instead of @xmath60    @xmath61    the integral ( [ eq4 ] ) can rewritten    @xmath62    first of all we calculate inner integral within limits @xmath63 depending on @xmath64 for given @xmath32 and @xmath65 there contributes only @xmath66 for which    @xmath67    but simultaneously @xmath66 must be inside the limits    @xmath68    which means , that for    @xmath69    or equivalently for    @xmath70    considered integral gives zero .",
    "for @xmath71 , when the both conditions ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) are compatible for some value @xmath66 the integral can be evaluated    @xmath72    therefore the integral ( [ eq6 ] ) can be expressed    @xmath73    let us note , the equation similar to this appears already in @xcite but with the structure function @xmath74 instead of the distribution one .",
    "we shall deal with the @xmath1 in the next subsection , where it will be shown , that the corresponding equation is more complicated .",
    "for a comparison see also @xcite , where on the place of @xmath75 the statistical distribution characterized by some temperature and chemical potential is used .",
    "next , from the relation ( [ eq10 ] ) we can express @xmath32 as a function @xmath76    @xmath77    using the relations ( [ k11 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) one can easily check    @xmath78    first let us insert @xmath79 into ( [ eq12 ] )    @xmath80    differentiation in respect to @xmath76 gives    @xmath81    now we integrate the density @xmath82 over angular variables obtaining    @xmath83    and after inserting into ( [ eq17 ] ) we get    @xmath84@xmath85 second root @xmath86 gives very similar result    @xmath87    from the definition    @xmath88    the useful relations easily follow    @xmath89    @xmath90    now , the equations ( [ eq19 ] ) , ( [ eq19a ] ) can be joined @xmath91 how to understand the two different partial intervals ( [ eq14 ] ) of @xmath32 give independently the complete distribution @xmath92 in eq.([eq20 ] ) ?",
    "it is due to the fact that e.g. @xmath86 represents in the integral ( [ eq4 ] ) the region    @xmath93    given by the paraboloid    @xmath94    containing complete information about @xmath82 which is spherically symmetric .",
    "the similar argument is valid for @xmath79 representing the rest of sphere .",
    "the eqs.([eq19 ] ) , ( [ eq19a ] ) imply the similarity of @xmath54 in both intervals    @xmath95    which with the use of second relation ( [ eq19d ] ) can be easily shown to be equivalent to @xmath96 the relation ( [ eq20 ] ) implies the distribution function @xmath54 should be increasing for @xmath97 and decreasing for @xmath98 e.g. as shown in fig.[fg2 ] .",
    "now let us calculate the following integrals .    _",
    "the total number @xmath99 of partons : _    @xmath100    @xmath101    the last integral can be modified with the use of ( [ eq19d ] ) , ( [ eq24 ] )    @xmath102    then integration by parts gives    @xmath103    _ the total energy @xmath104 of partons : _    @xmath105    @xmath106    a similar procedure as for @xmath99 then gives the result    @xmath107    therefore , the both descriptions based either on imf variable @xmath32 or the parton energy @xmath65 in the lab give the consistent results on the total number of partons and the fraction of energy carried by the partons .",
    "an important connection between the structure and distribution functions can be derived by a few ( equivalent ) ways , see e.g. textbooks @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in this paper we confine ourself to the electromagnetic unpolarized structure functions assuming spin 1/2 .",
    "the general form of cross section for the scattering _",
    "electron + proton _ and _ electron + point like , dirac particle _ can be written @xmath108 @xmath109 where electron tensor has the standard form @xmath110 and the remaining hadron and lepton tensors @xmath111 @xmath112 can be written in the  reduced  shape @xmath113 @xmath114 general assumption that the scattering on proton is realized via scattering on the partons implies @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a function describing distribution of partons according to some parameter(s ) @xmath117 now , if @xmath116 is substituted by the usual distribution function and we assume    @xmath118    then it is obvious , that eq.([sf05 ] ) will be fulfilled provided that @xmath119 for simplicity in this equation and anywhere in the next the weighting by the parton charges is omitted .",
    "in fact the eq.([sf3 ] ) is just a master equation in @xcite(lesson 27 , eq.(27.4 ) ) , from which the known relations are derived @xmath120 here , let us point out , this result is based on the approximation ( [ sf2 ] ) , which is acceptable in imf , but in addition only if _",
    "parton transversal momenta are neglected_. actually , relation ( [ sf2 ] ) would be exact only in the ( unrealistic ) case , when the partons are without any motion inside the nucleon , then the distribution function describes momenta fractions in _ any _ reference frame ( including imf ) , therefore describes also distribution of parton masses @xmath121 .    before repeating the above procedure for our distribution @xmath57 in lab , one has correctly account for the flux factor corresponding to partons moving inside the proton volume .",
    "for @xmath122 the flux factor in ( [ sf01 ] ) @xmath123 corresponds for some fixed @xmath124 to the subset of partons moving with velocity @xmath125 .",
    "if this velocity has the opposite direction to the probing electron , then after passing through the whole subset @xmath57 the electron has not still reached backward boundary of the proton , where meanwhile the new partons appeared . and",
    "on contrary , if the velocity of subset has the same direction as the electron , then not all of these partons have the same chance to meet this electron .",
    "namely , the partons close to the backward boundary are excluded from the game sooner than the electron reaches them .",
    "quantitatively , the number of partons limited by the proton volume and having chance to meet the electron ( with velocity @xmath126 will be @xmath127 including this correction to the flux factor ( [ sf06 ] ) , then instead of eq.([sf3 ] ) we get the tensor equation@xmath128",
    "@xmath129    for which ( [ sf2 ] ) _  is not required_. the terms with the functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 do not contribute to the cross section ( since @xmath132 ) , but generally must be included to ensure the equation consistence if the tensors are not gauge invariant . also let us note , the correction similar to ( [ sf07 ] ) was not used in the eq.([sf3 ] ) since due to ( [ sf2 ] ) the all partons in the applied approach have the same velocity as the proton .",
    "now the contracting of ( [ sf5 ] ) with tensors @xmath133 gives in the result set of four equations @xmath134\\delta \\left ( \\frac{pq}{m\\nu } -x\\right ) d^3p\\ ] ] @xmath135\\delta \\left ( \\frac{pq}{m\\nu } -x\\right ) d^3p\\ ] ] @xmath136\\delta \\left ( \\frac{pq}{m\\nu } -x\\right ) d^3p\\ ] ] @xmath137\\delta \\left ( \\frac{pq}{m\\nu }",
    "-x\\right ) d^3p\\ ] ] in which the @xmath138function from the integral ( [ sf5 ] ) is expressed @xmath139 if we define @xmath140 then the solution of the set ( [ r1])-([r4 ] ) reads @xmath141 + v_0(x)\\frac{2mx}\\nu + v_1(x)\\frac{2m^2x}{\\nu ^2}\\right\\ }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath142 + v_0(x)\\frac{6mx}\\nu + v_1(x)\\frac{6m^2x}{\\nu ^2}\\right\\ }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath143 -v_0(x)2x\\left ( 1-\\frac{mx}\\nu \\right ) -v_1(x)\\frac{3mx}\\nu \\right\\ }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath144 -v_0(x)3x+v_1(x)\\left ( 1-\\frac{mx}\\nu \\right ) \\right\\ }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] for next discussion we assume @xmath145 , then @xmath146 so it is obvious the callan - gross relation @xmath147 holds in this approximation .    in the next step , following the eq.([kd10 ] ) , we accept the approximation    @xmath148    then the integrals ( [ sf11 ] ) can be expressed @xmath149 this relation with the use of ( [ eq4]),([eq20 ] ) implies @xmath150 where @xmath151 is defined in ( [ eq19b ] ) .",
    "the relations ( [ r11 ] ) and ( [ eq19c ] ) give @xmath152 in the previous section we have shown such functions as ( [ r10 ] ) obey the relation ( [ eq24a ] ) , which means in particular , that the functions have a maximum at @xmath153 and vanish for @xmath154 .",
    "therefore the same statement is valid also for functions @xmath155 and @xmath156 from eq.([r9 ] ) @xmath157 this means that the structure functions of our idealized hadron also have the maximum at @xmath153 or higher , if the peak of @xmath158 is not rather sharp .",
    "obviously , the peak will be sharp if @xmath159 for @xmath160 .",
    "at the same time , it should be kept in mind , that due to ( [ kc10 ] ) any function expressed in ",
    "real  variable @xmath0 will be slightly smeared in view of this function expressed in @xmath32 .",
    "that is just the case of the integrals ( [ sf11 ] ) approximated by ( [ r10 ] ) . but",
    "this smearing should be quite negligible for very low @xmath0 and high @xmath31 , see end of section 2 .",
    "further , our considerations have started in previous section from the distribution function @xmath54 for which we have obtained relation ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "the combination of this equation with ( [ r9 ] ) , ( [ r11 ] ) and ( [ eq19c ] ) gives @xmath161 @xmath162 how to compare the last equation with the standard relation ( [ sf4 ] ) for @xmath163 and @xmath1 ?",
    "as we have already told , the standard approach ( [ sf3 ] ) is exact in the case when the partons are static with respect to the nucleon , i.e. when @xmath164 .",
    "the eq.([sf5 ] ) itself is more exact , but the further procedure with it requires the masses of the all partons in the considered subset being equal .",
    "therefore for a comparison let us consider first the extreme scenario when the parton distribution functions @xmath54 and @xmath92 are ( see eq.([eq20 ] ) ) rather narrowly peaked around the points @xmath165 and @xmath160 . then for @xmath166 eq.([r13 ] ) gives @xmath167 from which the second relation ( [ sf4 ] ) follows as a limiting case of ( [ r13 ] ) @xmath168 now , in the realistic case when the distribution functions are broad , the exact validity of ( [ sf3 ] ) again requires static partons , therefore the corresponding distribution function represents also a spectrum of masses .",
    "but then obviously the above procedure for a single @xmath56 can be repeated with spectrum of masses @xmath169 giving in the result instead of ( [ sf33 ] ) the relation @xmath170 which implies @xmath171 in this sense the approach based on eq.([sf3 ] ) can be understood as a limiting case of that based on eq.([sf5 ] ) .",
    "the considerations of previous subsection are based on the approximation ( [ sf7 ] ) which in the result gives relations ( [ r122 ] ) , ( [ r13 ] ) .",
    "actually we had to calculate integrals ( [ sf11 ] ) instead of ( [ r10 ] ) differing in the argument of @xmath172-function according to eq.([kd10 ] ) .",
    "the integrals ( [ sf11 ] ) can not be solved analytically according to the recipe for eq.([eq4 ] ) , however in principle their solution can by obtained by iterations . for example , first equation ( [ r9 ] ) reads @xmath173 let us have some @xmath1 , then algorithm of iterative procedure could be following :    \\0 .",
    "step : @xmath174 is given by eq.([r122 ] ) , @xmath175 is related to @xmath176 by ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "step : insert @xmath174 into ( [ sf48 ] ) , result of integration is some function @xmath177 make the difference @xmath178 and insert @xmath179 into ( [ r122 ] ) , the relation gives the corresponding correction @xmath180 .",
    "the result of this iterative step is @xmath181 then next steps will follow by analogy , on the end the corrected @xmath175 should be obtained .    more detailed discussion of considered correction exceeds scope of this paper and requires further study",
    ". the correction should be rather small , but let us remark that its evaluation requires some assumption about mass @xmath56 ( or spectrum of masses ) .",
    "also , let us note this correction together with terms @xmath182 in ( [ r5]),([r6 ] ) introduces into the structure functions some @xmath31 dependence having purely kinematic origin ( we still assume @xmath175 being @xmath31 independent ) .",
    "obviously , all these corrections vanish for @xmath183",
    "are the considerations suggested in previous section compatible with the assumptions and philosophy of qpm and all that , is it legally to speak about distribution function in lab ?",
    "first , let us shortly recall standard interpretation of dis in framework of qpm .",
    "in the classical experiment , e.g. bcdms @xcite muons scatter on proton target at rest in the _ laboratory system_. from measured angles and energies of the scattered muons one determines the invariant cross section as the function of kinematic invariants @xmath184 next , from this cross section the electromagnetic structure function @xmath185 is evaluated .",
    "the fact , that for sufficiently big @xmath31 the structure function ( approximately ) scales @xmath186 leads to the conclusion that in the experiment actually the scattering of two _ point - like _ particles takes place .",
    "this experimental fact is a basic motivation of the qpm in which it is postulated that the nucleon contains point - like electromagnetically active particles ( partons ) , which can be for sufficiently high @xmath31 treated as effectively free and their interaction with the muon is described by feynman diagram with one photon exchange .",
    "that also means the struck partons remain on - mass shell .",
    "these assumptions should be fulfilled first of all in the system , where our experiment is done , i.e. in lab . of course , another point is , that in this system the picture of partons is in some respect obscured by the fact , that we do not know more about the kinematics of partons , their momenta , energies .",
    "the picture is quite clarified , when we change over from lab to the imf . then the masses of partons do not play any role and energy is the same as momentum .",
    "simultaneously , the invariant parameter @xmath0 obtains simple physical sense - fraction of proton energy carried by the parton . and only now the quark - parton distribution functions can be introduced and their known connection with the structure function shown .    the difference between this standard approach and that of ours can be well seen by comparing of eqs.([sf3 ] ) , ( [ sf5 ] ) .",
    "the general philosophy according to which the scattering of charged lepton on a nucleon in dis is realized via scattering on point - like charged partons is common for both equations .",
    "the actual difference is rather only technical consisting in the choice of integration variables and approximations enabling to evaluate the integrals .    the practical consequence of more simplifying approach based on eq.([sf3 ] )",
    "is that resulting picture has good sense only in imf where also problem of parton masses is completely separated off , which can be even useful .    on the other hand , the approach based on eq.([sf5 ] ) , requiring in addition only assumption about the nucleon spherical symmetry , takes consistently into account parton transversal momenta and is not confined to some preferred system ( even though our results are presented in lab ) .",
    "there is one important consequence , namely in this description the parton masses , or more exactly ratio @xmath187 appeared as a free parameter .",
    "any speculation about parton mass already goes beyond postulates of qpm , nevertheless look on some experimental data . before coming to the proton structure function ,",
    "let us look at the fig.[fg4 ] ,    where the  structure function  of the deuteron measured in quasi - elastic @xmath188 scattering @xcite is shown , clearly proving the presence of two nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the similarity with general picture fig.[fg2 ] is well seen .",
    "the kinematics of the two nucleons in the deuteron rest system implies    @xmath189    where @xmath56 should be understood as some _ effective mass _ which , due to binding is slightly less then @xmath190 .",
    "this difference roughly corresponds to the depth of the potential if non - relativistic approach is used . from ( [ d3 ] )",
    "the kinematically allowed region for corresponding @xmath32 easily follows    @xmath191    in the case of partons inside the nucleon the situation is much more delicate .",
    "the interaction among the quarks and gluons is very strong , partons themselves are mostly in some shortly living virtual state , is it possible to speak about their mass at all ? strictly speaking probably not .",
    "the mass in exact sense is well defined only for free particles , whereas the partons are never free by definition .",
    "therefore let us try to speak at least about an _",
    "effective mass_. by this term we roughly mean the mass that a free parton would have to have to interact with the probing lepton equally as our bounded one .",
    "intuitively , this mass should correlate to @xmath31 .",
    "a lower @xmath31 allows more time and space for struck parton to interact with some others , in the result the energy is transferred to a greater system than the parton itself . on the contrary , the higher @xmath31 should mediate interaction with more  isolated  parton .",
    "now let us try the formulae from previous section ( with suggested sense of mass @xmath56 ) confront with the experimental data . in the fig.[fg5",
    "] recently obtained picture of the proton structure function @xmath1 @xcite is shown .",
    "no peak of that sort in fig.[fg2 ] or fig.[fg4 ] according to eq.([r121 ] ) is seen .",
    "there are two extreme alternatives .",
    "\\1 ) the effective mass @xmath187 of quarks can be for given @xmath31 well represented by one number .",
    "then , obviously this value should be below the experimental limit of @xmath32 @xmath192    \\2 ) the concept of effective mass reflects even for fixed @xmath31 rather some distribution than a single value .",
    "then the structure function is some superposition of curves similar to that in fig.[fg2 ] , but with different positions of their maxima .",
    "such superposition could be generated not only by different flavors but also by the components commonly denoted by the term valence and sea quarks with distribution functions given e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we shall not discuss the scenario of effective mass distribution in general , but only check one extreme : the case of static partons mentioned just below eq.([sf4 ] ) .",
    "these partons exactly obey the equation @xmath193 .",
    "obviously having measured @xmath1 from the limit @xmath194 , one can estimate the mean value @xmath195 the numerical calculation with the function fitting the data in the fig.[fg5 ] @xmath196(1-x)^{3.65}\\ ] ] gives the value @xmath197 in the region of tens @xmath198 depending on @xmath199 and @xmath31 very roughly as @xmath200 obviously , this scenario is less restrictive than the first one .",
    "it is possible , that the real case is somewhere between the two mentioned extremes . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath31 dependence in fig.[fg5 ] could be qualitatively understood in the manner suggested above : the higher @xmath31 prefers to mediate interactions with partons having less effective mass , therefore for higher @xmath31 the low @xmath32 region should be more populated .",
    "apparently , the quantitative expression of this correspondence is problem of dynamics .",
    "in the present paper we have discussed a connection between the parton distribution functions ordinarily defined in the infinite momentum frame and the analogous functions defined in the hadron rest system .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry of the hadron and an equal effective mass @xmath56 of the all partons of considered sort we have shown :      \\2 ) the proposed approach taking consistently parton transversal momenta into account gives the relation between the ( electromagnetic ) structure and distribution function somewhat modified in regard of the standard one .",
    "however , the standard relation is involved in that of our as a limiting case . the approach is not connected to any preferred reference system and explicitly involves ratio @xmath187 as a free parameter .",
    "\\ii ) the effective mass is at given @xmath31 represented by some distribution and moreover the partons are static .",
    "then the present data suggest the value @xmath205 should be at most of order @xmath206 .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath31 -dependence of structure function is qualitatively interpreted as a result of dynamic correlation of the effective mass and @xmath207 . +   + * acknowledgements",
