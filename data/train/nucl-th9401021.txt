    "just these effects are enhanced as @xmath4 .",
    "the last enhancement factor , the so - called weak nuclear charge @xmath5 which is numerically close to the neutron number @xmath6 , is due to the fact that in the nuclear - spin - independent phenomena all the nucleons act coherently .    as to the atomic pnc effects dependent on nuclear spin",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the constant - core - density approximation which leads to a closed analytical expression for nuclear am , and introduce some necessary notions and relations .",
    "then we consider somewhat more sophisticated model which still allows for an analytical treatment .",
    "this model gives some idea about the corrections to the above leading approximation .",

    "@xcite , the spin - orbit interaction itself is treated beyond the perturbation theory .    though the deviations of the contact and spin - orbit currents from naive potential expressions are included , but in all other respects we restrict throughout the present paper to the single - particle approximation , that of a valence nucleon above a spherically - symmetrical core .",
    "the many - body effects are certainly of importance for nuclear anapole moments .",
    "we shall consider them in future publications .",
    "pnc interaction in a system ( atomic nucleus is now of interest to us ) mixes opposite parity states of the same total angular momentum and creates in it a spin helical structure @xcite . in this way",
    "such a system with nonvanishing magnetic moment acquires a specific configuration of magnetic field , of the type created by the toroidal winding .",

    "the numerical value of the dimensionless constant @xmath17 in the case of an external proton is perhaps close to @xmath33 ( see . below ) . for an external neutron",
    "the corresponding constant @xmath34 is smaller , most probably @xmath35 .",
    "the leading approximation for the am of a heavy nucleus corresponds to the assumption that the density @xmath30 is constant throughout the space and coincides with the mean nuclear density @xmath36 .",
    "this approximation , first used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is reasonable if the wave function of the external nucleon is mainly localized in the region of the core .",

    "it might seem that now interaction ( [ eq : w ] ) , which is equivalent to the electromagnetic interaction with a constant vector- potential @xmath42 , should not result in any physical effects at all .",
    "however , the spin part of the current density @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the nucleon magnetic moment ) does work due to the noncommutativity of the @xmath45-matrices , even in this approximation .",

    "indeed , since the anapole corresponds to the magnetic field configuration induced by a toroidal winding , the am value should be proportional to the magnetic flux , i.e. , to the cross - section area of the torus .",

    "a convenient characteristic of the nuclear am for the atomic pnc problem is the dimensionless constant @xmath9 . according to ( [ eq : al ] ) it equals @xcite @xmath61 the enhancement @xmath62 compensates to a large degree the small fine structure constant @xmath63 .",
    "that is why the nuclear am is perhaps the main source of the nuclear - spin - dependent pnc effects in heavy atoms @xcite .",

    "the wave function and the green s function of the valence nucleon were calculated with a woods - saxon potential which included the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the crude analytical calculation is obviously in reasonable agreement with that numerical one .",
    "our analysis of various contributions to nuclear am beyond the leading approximation we will start from a more realistic model which still allows for an analytical treatment .",
    "the model consists in the use of the oscillator potential for the valence nucleon and in neglect of the spin - orbit interaction .",

    "@xcite to estimate the contribution of core excitations and to rederive formula ( [ eq : al ] ) ( which follows indeed from expression ( [ eq : ap ] ) at @xmath73 when taking into account the oscillator - potential version of the virial theorem : @xmath74 ) .",
    "we pass over now to the orbital contribution to the am . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the am of a charged particle in a spherically symmetrical potential can pe presented in the following form : @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the p - odd admixture of an intermediate state @xmath77 to the initial one @xmath78 ( this coefficient is purely imaginary ) , @xmath79 is the matrix element of @xmath80 between those states , @xmath81 is the contact current operator : @xmath82=\\frac{gg}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{e}{m } \\rho \\vec{\\sigma}.\\ ] ] therefore , to take into account within the simple - minded potential approach the orbital contribution for a proton we should substitute @xmath83 for @xmath44 in formula ( [ eq : ap ] ) and add to that expression the following contact term : @xmath84 in the case of a valence neutron formula ( [ eq : ap ] ) needs obviously no modification within the same model .",
    "however , in fact the contact current contribution both for a valence proton and neutron looks differently .",
    "indeed , let us start from the weak interaction hamiltonian for the outer nucleon @xmath85 constructed from corresponding two - body operators ( see , e.g. , book @xcite ) : @xmath86 \\cdot\\vec{\\nabla}\\delta(\\vec{r}_a - \\vec{r}_b)\\right),\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath87 means anticommutator .",
    "after averaging this expression over the core nucleons we obtain formula ( [ eq : w ] ) with @xmath88 the `` best values '' @xcite of weak coupling constants in the one - meson - exchange approximation lead to the following numbers for the constants discussed @xcite : @xmath89 and correspondingly to @xmath90 for the valence proton in cs , tl , bi , and @xmath91 for the valence neutron in @xmath92pb . here the constants @xmath93 and @xmath34 are effective ones , they include already the exchange terms for identical nucleons .",
    "these constants include also additional suppression factors reflecting long - range and exchange nature of the p - odd one - meson exchange as well as the short - range nucleon - nucleon repulsion .",
    "their values agree with those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and differ from those given in ref .",
    "@xcite since we include into the @xmath15-meson exchange the suppression due to the short - range repulsion .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction can be introduced by changing @xmath94 .",
    "the current density operator is then a derivative of a hamiltonian over @xmath95 .",

    "the empirical data on the latter ( referring unfortunately to lighter nuclei only ) are presented in table [ tab : r ] .",
    "the observation is that in the @xmath116 , with a valence neutron , @xmath115 is close within the error bars to the value predicted by the oscillator model .",
    "meanwhile for nuclei with odd proton , @xmath117 , its value is much better approximated by the naive formula ( [ eq : msr ] ) .",
    "for further calculations it is natural to go over to the usual dimensionless oscillator variable @xcite @xmath118 then the expectation values entering eqs .",

    "the numerical results for nuclear ams , obtained in this model , are presented in table [ tab : k ] . for cs ,",
    "tl and bi , at the same value of @xmath17 , they are about 10% smaller than those of the leading approximation .",
    "the correction to the spin current contribution constitutes about -4% in cs and bi , -7% in tl .",

    "the contact current contribution , though nonvanishing , is very small numerically .",
    "though being convenient for analytical treatment , the step - like density profile and oscillator model for a single particle potential are however too crude . moreover , the above analytical model does not take into account the spin - orbit interaction which is , as we will see below , quite essential for numerical results .",

    "are shown in fig.1 . in the same picture",
    "we demonstrate how @xmath146 is influenced by the spin - orbit potential , as well as by the deviation of the density from a constant one .",
    "the real form of @xmath146 differs considerably from the leading approximation , due mainly to the spin - orbit interaction . as to the realistic density profile , it makes @xmath146 slightly smaller as compared to the constant density approximation .",
    "all contributions to the anapole moment can be expressed via the radial correction @xmath146 .",
    "the spin current term can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ag ] ) by substituting @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "so , this contribution to the dimensionless anapole constant equals @xmath151    to obtain the convection current contribution we substitute corresponding current density operator @xmath152 into formula ( [ eq : a ] ) which gives @xmath153 and @xmath154    when calculating the contact current contributions it is convenient again to split it into the `` naive '' part arising from a single particle potential ( and vanishing for a valence neutron ) and the part which is due to the current densities ( [ cc ] ) , ( [ ccn ] ) .",

    "am and to @xmath9 is respectively : @xmath159 @xmath160    however , as it was the case with the contact current , this is not the complete result .",
    "the true spin - orbit current must be obtained from two - particle spin - orbit interaction which can be written as @xmath161 averaging it over nuclear core we obtain the spin - orbit part of the single - particle potential ( [ wspot ] ) with @xmath162 the spin - orbit interaction constants were fitted in ref .",

    ". we will understand expression ( [ eq : so ] ) as a local limit for an operator of a nucleon - nucleon interaction with the proper tensor structure .",

    "magnetic transition amplitudes improves the agreement with experiment .    in the current density generated by the @xmath166 part of operator ( [ eq : so ] ) the exchange and direct contributions cancel each other , i.e. , the contact spin - orbit @xmath166 interaction does not generate a current at all .",
    "then , averaging expression ( [ jls ] ) over the core nucleons and separating the single particle contribution ( [ jls0 ] ) , as in the case of the contact current , we get the following effective spin - orbit current for the valence proton : @xmath167 the correction @xmath168 to the `` naive '' spin - orbit proton current is relatively small being suppressed by a factor @xmath169 as compared to the potential part .",
    "this factor constitutes -0.16 for cesium and -0.15 for thallium and bismuth .",
    "it is noteworthy that even for a valence neutron the spin - orbit current does not vanish .",
    "it is generated by the neutron - proton interaction and equals @xmath170 this expression is similar to the spin current density ( [ eq : js ] ) and renormalizes in an obvious way the magnetic moment of an outer neutron .",

    "the corrections to it @xmath173 and @xmath174 in fact go beyond the single - particle approximation .",
    "the single - particle contribution can be written in a more compact form , analogous to ( [ eq : a0 ] ) : @xmath175 this expression was used to check the accuracy of our numerical calculations which turned out very high .    to study the stability of am calculations under the variations of the single - particle potential we performed them for two sets of the woods - saxon potential parameters ( [ wspot ] ) . in both sets",
    "the radii and diffuseness parameters , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , are the same for the profiles of central and spin - orbit parts of potential .",
    "the first set is @xcite : @xmath178 where the signs @xmath179 and @xmath180 refer to neutrons and protons respectively .",
    "the second set @xcite has somewhat different parameters , but gives as good fit to the single - particle level positions .",
    "it is : @xmath181    in both cases we assume the same values of the density parameters @xcite : @xmath182    the results of calculations obtained for both sets are listed in table [ t : sc ] . the main contribution to am , as expected ,",
    "comes from the spin current .",
    "the variation of the parameters of potential changes this term by 3  6% .",
    "the next in magnitude term is due to the potential part of spin - orbit current , it constitutes about 30% of the spin current contribution .    in the calculations based on the sets of parameters",
    "( [ bmls ] ) and ( [ chpls ] ) the ls - potential was not consistent with the two - particle ls - interaction ( [ eq : so ] ) .",
    "so , the potential ls - contribution to the am was calculated in two ways .",
    "first , starting from the ls - potential itself .",
    "second , it was obtained from the spin - orbit potential constructed from the two - particle interaction ( [ eq : so ] ) - ( [ uls2 ] ) .",
    "the difference between second and first ways of calculation is listed as @xmath183 in table [ t : sc ] .",
    "it is only natural to perform a consistent calculation , choosing the amplitude of ls - potential in accordance with ( [ uls ] ) , ( [ uls2 ] ) , and its radius and diffuseness parameters the same as those of nuclear density . in this way",
    "we come to the third , ls - consistent , version of the potential : @xmath184 we kept the central potential parameters as in ( [ bmls ] ) because it gave smaller @xmath185 .",
    "the calculation based on this version of the potential give @xmath186 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the sum of all contributions to am is less sensitive to a specific potential than each of them taken separately .",
    "its variation does not exceed 5% when going from one set of parameters to another .",
    "we believe that the results obtained with the ls - consistent potential are the most reliable ones .",
    "they are presented in the last line of table [ tab : k ] .",
    "let us discuss now why the present results differ from those obtained in refs.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the woods - saxon potential used here for numerical calculations is more realistic than the oscillator one used for those calculations in refs .",
    "then , in refs",
    ". @xcite the spin - orbit interaction is treated perturbatively , while in the present work it is treated exactly .",
    "let us note here again that the oscillator potential without spin - orbit interaction allows one to get an exact analytic solution for the am , as it has been done in section 3 of the present work .    to summarize the comparison we wish to say that the above arguments can serve as serious grounds to consider the numerical results of the present work to be the most reliable ones for the single - particle approximation .",
    "however , accurate quantitative predictions for nuclear am s can not be made without proper treatment of nuclear many - body effects .",
    "as to the core excitations by the weak interaction hamiltonian ( [ 2b ] ) , their contribution to nuclear am has been demonstrated to be small @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of the configurations mixing caused by usual p - even residual nucleon - nucleon interaction is here much more serious than in the case of nuclear magnetic moments ( or the second neutral current constant @xcite ) .",
    "the point is that in the last cases it is the specific , kinematical , nature of the operator @xmath28 which allows one to restrict with a reasonable accuracy to the excitations within a spin - orbit doublet only . as to the am , even if the multiconfiguration problem could be reduced to the calculations with the effective operator ( [ eq : lo ] ) ( which demands a special proof by itself ) , that operator is coordinate - dependent and in this sense resembles more the magnetic octupole operator than the magnetic dipole one . and many - body effects can renormalize m3 operator much more strongly than m1 operator . a drastic example in this respect",
    "is @xmath3bi where the one - particle value of the magnetic octupole moment is almost four times smaller than the experimental one @xcite .",
    "let us note here that due to the theoretical uncertainties discussed , in the situation when the am contribution dominates essentially atomic nuclear - spin - dependent pnc effects , the proposal @xcite to single out in those effects the true neutral current contribution by combining experimental data from various heavy nuclei , does not look realistic .    in conclusion",
    "it should be emphasized however that even with all those theoretical uncertainties kept in mind , the problem of experimental observation of a new physical phenomenon , nuclear anapole moment , is a fascinating one . moreover",
    ", if the theoretical results of one - particle approximation , which are by themselves remarkably stable by nuclear standards , will be supplemented by a serious treatment of many - body effects , those experimental investigations will give reliable quantitative information on p - odd nuclear forces .",
    "one of the authors ( i.b.kh . )",
    "wishes to thank the institute for nuclear theory , university of washington , and the theoretical physics groups of the universities of new south wales , melbourne and cambridge , where part of this work was done , for their kind hospitality .",
