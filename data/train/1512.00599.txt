    "quantum entanglement , which is one of the quintessential features of quantum theory and a manifestation of nonlocality of quantum mechanics  @xcite , shows stronger correlations than classically explainable  @xcite .",
    "it is of great importance for quantum information science and fundamental issues of quantum theory .",
    "for example , bell - basis states as important entangled states have been widely used in quantum information processing tasks such as quantum computation  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , entanglement swapping  @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite , and quantum secure direct communication  @xcite .",
    "for a two - particle entangled state , neither particle possesses its own well - defined state before performing the measurement , while once the state of one particle is measured the state of another particle is also defined instantaneously .",
    "photon entanglement has be in fact realized in various degrees of freedom .",
    "entangled photon states have hitherto been mostly realized by the two orthogonal polarization states of photons . to enable more efficient use of communication channels in quantum cryptography ,",
    "multi - dimensional entanglement is of great importance .",
    "higher - order entanglement has been suggested via multiport beam splitters  @xcite .",
    "orbital angular momentum ( oam ) carried by photons with helical phase structures  @xcite , as a fundamentally controllable degree of freedom of photons , has attracted extensive attention and academic interest in quantum foundations and quantum information .",
    "the oam as a degree of freedom has many novel properties and important applications , for instance , uncertainty relations of angular position - oam  @xcite , violation of the bell inequality  @xcite , preparation of the four bell states  @xcite , and qutrit quantum communication protocols  @xcite .",
    "as the quanta of oam carried by a single photon has no theoretical upper limit , which defines an infinitely dimensional discrete hilbert space , the oam offers a practical way to create multi - dimensional entanglement  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on quantum entangled vector - polarization states of photons  @xcite .",
    "we present vector - polarization entangled bell states , which use the spatial modes of the vector fields with space - variant polarization distribution  @xcite .",
    "we propose a scheme of creating the vector - polarization entangled bell states based on a sagnac interferometer  @xcite .",
    "we also design an analyzer for identifying the vector - polarization entangled bell states .",
    "because the vector fields can be considered as a combination of a pair of orthogonally polarized fields ( photons ) carrying the opposite - handedness quantized oams  @xcite , it is predictable that our approach provides another practical route to define an infinitely dimensional discrete hilbert space and to future extend to multi - dimensional multi - particle entanglement , enabling more efficient use of communication channels in quantum cryptography . furthermore , due to the combination of polarization and oam , the vector - polarization entanglement may increase security with respect to the polarization or oam entanglement in quantum cryptography .",
    "it is conceivable that the vector - polarization bell states could be of considerable importance in quantum communication , information , cryptography and teleportation , making them versatile and potentially suitable for future technologies .",
    "polarization , momenta and phase are regarded as the controllable degrees of freedom of photons . for the polarization degree of freedom ,",
    "the maximally entangled bell states of two photons are written as    @xmath0 and @xmath1 indicate the horizontal and vertical polarization eigenstates , respectively .    as is well known , it is easy to transform one bell state into another one .",
    "for instance , for @xmath2 , ( i ) @xmath2 can be changed into @xmath3 with the aid of the polarization exchange ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) which can be realized by a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , ( ii ) @xmath2 can be transformed into @xmath6 with the aid of the polarization - dependent phase shift which is generated by a quarter - wave plate ( qwp )  @xcite , and ( iii ) @xmath2 can be converted into @xmath7 with the aid of both polarization exchange and polarization phase shift , respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the well - known pauli matrix being both hermitian and unitary , and can also describe the jones matrix of the hwp with its fast axis at @xmath11 with respect to the horizontal axis .    the optical field with the helical phase structure of @xmath12 $ ] ( shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "1a ) carries the oam of @xmath13 per photon , where @xmath14 is referred to as the topological charge or winding number and can take any integer value  @xcite .",
    "the oam degree of freedom can be regarded as a kind of degree of freedom of azimuth - variant phase .",
    "although the helical structure exhibits the phase change in two dimensions in the cartesian coordinate system , it is in fact the azimuthal phase change in one dimension in the polar coordinate system . during the propagation , the optical fields carrying the oam exhibit the intertwined ( or helical ) phase front with its handedness depending on the sign of @xmath14 ( a-1 and a-2 in fig .",
    "differently from the sam or polarization which constructs a two dimensional hilbert space only , the oam as a new degree of freedom can define an infinitely dimensional discrete ( the quantization of oam ) hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "we have known that the vector fields with the space - variant distribution of states of polarization can be produced by combining a pair of orthogonally polarized optical fields carrying the opposite oams ( or the helical phases with the opposite handedness )  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the technique of generating the vector fields has become very mature  @xcite . due to novel properties , the vector fields have many potential applications in various realms  @xcite , including quantum information  @xcite . since the vector field is always associated with a pair of oams with the opposite handedness , it is possible to define an infinitely dimensional discrete ( the quantization of vector - polarization state ) hilbert space ( fig .",
    "1b ) , which provides an opportunity that the vector - polarization states as the degree of freedom are extended from two dimensional hilbert space to a higher dimensional one .",

    "makes the two counter - propagating fields ( or photons ) feel the opposite chirality of the helical phases of @xmath57 and then carry the opposite oams of @xmath58 .",

    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , the accumulated operator of svpp and gps units in the sagnac interferometers can be rewritten as @xmath70 . after passing through the generation system of vector - polarization states , the evolutions of the eigenstates of @xmath71 and @xmath1 when @xmath72 and @xmath73 are as follows    @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    when @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the evolutions of the eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath1 can be written as follows    @xmath78 and @xmath79 . after leaving from the generation system of vector - polarization states , photons @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "are converted into photons @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . by manipulating the polarization bell states ,",
    "therefore , the preparation of the vector - polarization bell states can be realized .",
    "we present a vector - polarization bell - state analyzer ( fig .",
    "2c ) which is similar to the analyzer in ref .  @xcite .",
    "photons @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) will meet a fork - shaped phase grating ( fspg ) .",
    "when the fspg has the same topological charge with the svpp mentioned above , an incoming photon in the state @xmath80 @xmath81 , where @xmath82 or @xmath83 , will be transformed into two equal - probability diffraction beams : one is the right - circularly polarized state @xmath84 in the @xmath85st ( @xmath86st ) diffraction order and the other one is the left - circularly polarized state @xmath87 in the @xmath86st ( @xmath85st ) diffraction order , and both beams carry no oam .",

    "finally , the analysis of the vector - polarization - entangled bell states with joint measurement can be realized .",
    "it should be noted that there are some similarities between the oam states and the vector - polarization states .",
    "for example , both of them use the same parameter called topological charge @xmath14 to describe the two - dimensional spatial distributions , as shown in fig .  1 .",

    "photons in the vector - polarization state carry the information of both the oam and the space - variant polarization .",
    "compared with the oam states , the vector - polarization states have some advantages such as , for a given topological charge @xmath14 , only one oam state @xmath94 corresponds to it , while there are two vector - polarization states @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "a major challenge is to ultimately confirm the entanglement in experiment , which may be a bell inequality experiment generalized to more states . for a linearly - polarized pump field with zero angular momentum ( including spin and orbital angular momentum )",
    ", the emitted state can be represented by @xmath97    where @xmath98 denote the corresponding probability amplitude for measuring @xmath99 ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) .",
    "the photonic state  ( 12 ) is an infinite dimensional entangled state for two photons , meaning neither photon possesses a well - defined vector - polarization state after parametric down - conversion .",
    "the measurement of one photon defines its vector - polarization state , and projects the second one into the corresponding vector - polarization state .",
    "the state in eq .",
    "( 12 ) is composed of infinite dimensional vector - polarization basis which forms an infinite dimensional hilbert space .    in summary",
    ", we have proposed the concept of the vector - polarization bell state from traditional polarization state by analogy between the oam and phase , and extended the hilbert space of degree of polarization from two dimensions to indefinite dimensions .",
    "the polarization entangled bell states have been constructed . by using some optical elements and a sagnac interferometer ,",
    "an effective vector - polarization states generation system has been presented .",
    "we have also designed an analyzer to distinguish the vector - polarization bell states by using the linear optical elements only .",
    "the similarities and differences between oam states and vector - polarization states have been pointed out .",
    "the vector - polarization state is an independent degree of freedom from the oam states although it is always associated to a pair of opposite oams . differently from the traditional polarization states ,",
    "the vector - polarization states are also  quantized \" , because which are always associated with a pair of quantized oams with opposite handedness .",
    "these vector - polarization states could be in fact extended to higher - dimensional multi - particle entanglement .",
    "these vector - polarization states could be anticipated many applications in quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation , quantum communication , and quantum information , due to their higher dimensions and larger flux of information .",
