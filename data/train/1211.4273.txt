    "in this paper , we study rate of convergence of markov processes to an invariant measure in the wasserstein metric .",
    "we establish subgeometric bounds on the convergence rate , thus generalizing the results of @xcite .",
    "we apply the obtained estimates to prove subgeometric ergodicity of strong solutions of stochastic differential delay equations ( sddes ) under veretennikov  khasminskii - type conditions .",
    "this extends the corresponding results @xcite for stochastic differential equations ( without delay ) .",
    "there are quite a few works which deal with convergence of harris recurrent markov chains in total variation ; see , for example , the monograph @xcite and the references therein .",
    "less is known about convergence of markov chains that are not harris recurrent .",
    "recall @xcite that if a markov chain has a unique invariant measure , then either ( a ) the chain is positive harris recurrent in an absorbing set and the invariant measure is nonsingular , or ( b ) the invariant measure is singular and there are no harris sets .",
    "it is quite clear that in case  ( b ) the marginal distributions of the markov chain do not converge in total variation , whereas they might converge weakly ( and , hence , in the wasserstein metric ) .",
    "thus , for non - harris chains [ case  ( b ) ] it is natural to study convergence in the wasserstein metric ( rather than in the total variation metric ) .",
    "many interesting markov processes fall into case ( b ) .",
    "for instance , following  @xcite , consider sdde @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a one - dimensional brownian motion and @xmath4 is a strictly increasing positive bounded continuous function .",
    "one can show that the strong solution of this equation has a unique invariant measure and converges to it weakly , but not in total variation . on the other hand , the wasserstein distance between @xmath5 and the invariant measure decays exponentially to zero as @xmath6 .",
    "section  [ s3 ] contains further examples of processes belonging to case  ( b ) .",
    "many methods of estimation of convergence rates in the total variation metric assume that a markov process is @xmath7-irreducible and are based on the analysis of small sets .",
    "probably , one of the first results in this area is due to dobrushin @xcite , who proved that if the whole state space is small , then a markov chain is exponentially ergodic .",
    "later popov @xcite and nummelin and tuominen @xcite replaced the global dobrushin condition with a combination of a local dobrushin condition ( existence of a `` good '' small set ) and the lyapunov drift condition ( ldc ) .",
    "this result was further extended by jarner and roberts @xcite and douc and coauthors @xcite , who established polynomial and general subgeometric estimates of convergence rate , correspondingly .",
    "similar results for continuous time markov processes ( under an additional assumption that the state space is locally compact ) are due to fort and roberts @xcite and douc , fort and guillin @xcite .",
    "the latter work provides subgeometric estimates of the convergence rate under condition that a certain functional of a markov process is a supermartingale .",
    "let us also mention the recent paper of hairer and mattingly @xcite , which contains a new simple proof of the exponential ergodicity of a markov process under ldc and the local dobrushin condition .",
    "thus , many techniques rely on the irreducibility of a markov process , the existence of a `` good '' small set , and ( for continuous time processes ) the local compactness of the state space . however , if the state space is infinite - dimensional , then in most `` typical '' situations the process is non - harris and , therefore these assumptions are not fulfilled .",
    "for instance , if we go back to the above sdde , then it is easy to check that this processes is not @xmath7-irreducible , the state space is not locally compact and , as was pointed in @xcite , all small sets of this process are degenerate ( i.e. , consists of no more than one point ) .    an alternative to the local dobrushin condition",
    "was suggested by bakry , cattiaux and guillin in @xcite .",
    "they obtained estimates of convergence rate in the total variation metric , provided that the ldc holds , and a markov process has a unique invariant measure , which satisfies a local poincar inequality on a large enough set .",
    "let us discuss another alternative to this set of assumptions , which was developed by hairer , mattingly , and scheutzow @xcite specifically for establishing exponential convergence rates of sddes , stochastic pdes , and other infinite - dimensional processes in the wasserstein metric . exploiting a new notion of a @xmath0-small set ( a  generalization of the notion of a small set )",
    ", in conjunction with the ldc , and without any additional assumptions on the irreducibility of the process , the authors proved the existence of a spectral gap in a suitable norm , and , hence , the exponential convergence to stationarity.=-1    we extend this result and consider the more general situation where a spectral gap may not exist . for discrete time markov processes ( theorem  [ thdiscretetime ] )",
    "we prove that existence of a `` good '' @xmath0-small set and the ldc implies subgeometrical convergence in the wasserstein metric . in the continuous time setting ( theorem  [ thcontinuoustime ] ) we obtain the same rate of convergence provided that there exists a `` good '' small set and the douc  fort  guillin supermartingale condition holds .",
    "thus , we also extend the results of @xcite .",
    "we apply our conditions to study the asymptotic behavior of strong solutions of sddes .",
    "we prove that veretennikov  khasminskii - type conditions are sufficient for subexponential ergodicity ( theorem [ thsddecoeff ] ) .",
    "this extends the results of  .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the proofs of the main results are placed in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "let @xmath8 be a homogeneous markov chain on a measurable space @xmath9 with transition functions @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . as usual for @xmath14 we will drop the upper index and write @xmath15 .",

    "we consider also the _ total variation metric _ on the space @xmath19 , which is defined by the following formula : @xmath31 recall that if the space @xmath23 is equipped with the discrete metric @xmath32 , @xmath33 , then the wasserstein distance is just half of the total variation distance , that is , @xmath34 , @xmath25 .",

    "however , as discussed above , a markov process might have no small sets that consist of more than one point . to study such markov processes hairer , mattingly and",

    "namely , the multiplier @xmath40 appears on the right - hand side of the above inequality .    if @xmath41 , then the notions of a small set and a @xmath0-small set coincide . in the general case ,",
    "the latter notion is much weaker than the former . in section  [ sect31 ]",
    "we give an example of a markov operator @xmath35 that has a @xmath0-small state space and no nontrivial small sets .",
    "before we present our main result , let us recall that the total variation metric is contracting , that is , for any markov semigroup @xmath42 one has @xmath43 whenever @xmath44 . in general , the wasserstein metric @xmath24 may not be contracting .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in @xcite , it is natural to focus only on wasserstein metrics that are contracting for the process @xmath45 , since , in the general case , the lyapunov drift condition is not sufficient even for a weak convergence toward the invariant measure . note that the contractivity condition itself does not imply any convergence at all , either .",
    "it is the combination of the contractivity , the lyapunov drift condition and the existence of a `` good '' @xmath0-small set , which yields the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and subgeometric convergence in the wasserstein metric .    for a function @xmath46",
