    ".   fixes @xmath316 for all @xmath321 via the identity @xmath322 for integers @xmath66 and @xmath323 that are relatively prime .",
    "it is a routine exercise to calculate the euler factors of the corresponding dirichlet series generating function and to express @xmath324 in terms of the two zeta functions mentioned .",
    "note that @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is the @xmath327-series of the primitive dirichlet character @xmath328 defined by @xmath329    observe next that @xmath330 for all @xmath321 , so that also the number @xmath65 of csls must be positive ( though we can still have @xmath331 ) .",
    "moreover , each element of @xmath332 can be written as a product of a rotation with a reflection that maps @xmath0 onto itself .",
    "consequently , the simple coincidence spectrum @xmath333 is the set of all positive integers .",
    "although multiple coincidences may produce further lattices , compare @xcite , the total spectrum @xmath334 can not be larger than the elementary one , so that the following consequence is clear .",
    "[ spectra ] the multiple coincidence spectra of the root lattice @xmath0 coincide with the elementary one , and one has @xmath335 , which is a monoid .",
    "the dirichlet series @xmath336 is analytic in the open right half - plane @xmath337 , and has a simple pole at @xmath338 .",
    "the corresponding residue is given by @xmath339 which is based on the special values @xmath340 together with @xmath341 , compare @xcite and references given there .",
    "the value of @xmath342 is known to be irrational , but has to be calculated numerically .    with this information",
    ", we can extract the asymptotic behaviour of the counts @xmath316 from the generating function @xmath343 by delange s theorem , see ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) for a formulation tailored to this situation .",
    "one obtains , as @xmath344 , @xmath345 clearly , this is also an upper bound for the asymptotic behaviour of the true csl counts .    as mentioned earlier , one is primarily interested in the number @xmath65 of csls of index @xmath66 , which satisfies @xmath346 for all @xmath321 in view of corollary  [ spectra ] .",
    "some preliminary calculations show that also @xmath65 is multiplicative .",
    "in fact , one has @xmath347 for all primes @xmath348 , and @xmath349 for @xmath350 .",
    "for the remaining primes @xmath351 , one has @xmath352 , but differences occur for all powers @xmath353 with @xmath354 .",
    "this happens first for @xmath355 and is induced by the more complicated factorisation for these primes , compare @xcite for a similar phenomenon .",
    "consequently , the modification for the prime @xmath81 is sufficient up to index @xmath356 .",
    "the dirichlet series generating function thus starts as @xmath357 at this stage , the general mechanism behind this is not completely unravelled , but we hope to present it in greater generality in @xcite .",
    "in one dimension , the csl problem becomes trivial , so that @xmath358 in this case . in two dimensions , a rather general approach to lattices and modules is possible via classic algebraic number theory , see @xcite and references therein , which includes the treatment of multiple coincidences .",
    "for the root lattice @xmath359 , the csl generating function reads @xmath360 where @xmath361 is a primitive cube root of @xmath114 . here , the equality is a consequence of the commutativity of @xmath362 .",
    "the simple coincidence spectrum of this lattice is the multiplicative monoid of integers that is generated by the rational primes @xmath363 mod @xmath364 .    in @xmath364-space ,",
    "various examples are derived in @xcite and have recently been proved by quaternionic methods @xcite similar to the ones used here . among these cases is the root lattice @xmath365 , which happens to be the face centred cubic lattice in @xmath364-space , with generating function @xmath366 the equality of the two dirichlet series to the left is non - trivial , and was proved in @xcite with an argument involving eichler orders .",
    "the same formula also applies to the other cubic lattices in @xmath364-space @xcite .",
    "the simple coincidence spectrum is thus the set of odd integers , which is again a monoid .",
    "the multiple analogues have recently been derived in @xcite , see also @xcite for related results .",
    "several of these results are also included by now in @xcite . in @xmath78-space , various other lattices and modules of interest",
    "exist , for which some results are given in @xcite , with more structural proofs and generalisations being in preparation @xcite . beyond dimension @xmath78 ,",
    "very little is known @xcite , though it should be possible to derive the simple coincidence spectra for certain classes of lattices .",
