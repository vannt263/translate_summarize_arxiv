    "<S> , @xmath17 decreases monotonically , indicating a sub - diffusive regime , in which the dynamics is affected by locally critical or insulating regions of increasing size . in this regime , we find good agreement between experiment and ed , suggesting that the correlation length @xmath0 , and hence the size of typical rare - regions relaxing on the experimental timescales , are smaller than the simulated system size of 16 sites . eventually , the experimental values of @xmath17 saturate at a non - zero offset @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that this offset is consistent with the expected effect of background decays in our system  @xcite , suggesting that @xmath17 could indeed vanish at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we note that also on the mbl side there may be a regime of slow , logarithmic relaxation towards the stationary value of the imbalance  @xcite . during the moderate times accessed in this study </S>",
    "<S> , such a slow logarithmic relaxation might also contribute to the finite value of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the ed calculations also likely fail to pinpoint the transition , as the correlation length becomes larger than the system size used for the simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> close to the transition , @xmath17 is expected to show a universal dependence according to @xmath60  @xcite for true - random disorder . however , from our data it is not possible to access this critical scaling regime , as the background decay masks the behavior close to the transition and the scaling behavior might not be valid further away from the transition . additionally , it is not a priori clear whether the observed power - law decay of the state induced rare regions will persist to all times , as the initial state will be rearranged when the system thermalizes , especially in the presence of a mobile spin - sector  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exponents_fig ] we show two exemplary critical scalings with exponents of @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both behaviors would be consistent with our data . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the two scalings give different values of @xmath1 , and hence we are not able to precisely pinpoint the location of the phase transition point . +    [ [ conclusion . ] ] * conclusion. * + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have experimentally observed slow , interaction - induced relaxation dynamics close to the mbl phase transition in the aubry - andr model , in very good agreement with ed simulations . specifically , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a decay of an initial charge - density wave , which is consistent with a power - law and hence reminiscent of dynamics predicted and found in spin models with true - random disorder  @xcite attributed to rare griffiths regions . </S>",
    "<S> while such dynamics has been argued not to exist in quasi - periodic systems  @xcite , they can emerge from randomness in the initial state and a spin density dependent transition point , a mechanism that is also relevant to spin models  @xcite . from our data , we can extract the dynamical exponent @xmath17 , which we find to continuously decrease when approaching the transition , indicating the presence of a sub - diffusive regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , finite couplings to the environment prevent us from precisely pinpointing the location of the transition or extracting accurate values for the universal exponent @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> future works could address the problem of a finite bath coupling via a systematic analysis of its effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this could also allow addressing the question of the long term fate of initial state induced rare regions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the suggested mechanism for the creation of rare regions could be tested by e.g.  loading initial states with different entropies . </S>",
    "<S> a similar study would also be interesting in the presence of true - random disorder , where the dynamics in the weak - disorder regime could be investigated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting direction is the investigation of griffiths effects in higher dimensional and floquet mbl systems  @xcite </S>",
