    "observations of type 1a supernovae @xcite , of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and of large - scale structure @xcite indicate that the universe is currently experiencing a stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "when the sn data is considered independently of any other osbervations , the resulting constraints on dark energy parameters allow ( indeed , prefer ) values for the equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the cosmological pressure and energy density of the dark energy component @xcite .",
    "however , when cosmic microwave background and large - scale - structure data are considered as well , the constraints become much tighter , and there is not much space to wiggle around @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , much thought has been devoted to the possibility that superacceleration ( @xmath5 ) may rule our universe in the near future @xcite and even cause a future spacelike singularity ( `` big - rip '' ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that , in the realm of general relativity , a non - interacting phantom matter field is a very tough sell indeed .",
    "if we try to build phantom matter out of canonical scalar fields , we are led to consider a negative kinetic term in the lagrangian @xcite , which makes the theory unstable  classically _ and _ quantum - mechanically @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we enlarge the class of scalar field lagrangians to include those of the type of k - essence @xcite , then , as we will presently show , phantom k - matter @xcite suffers from at least three basic problems .",
    "first , phantom k - matter is quantum - mechanically unstable .",
    "this means that there is always a region in phase space where hard ( uv ) excitations of the field possess negative energies .",
    "since there is nothing that can prevent positive - energy modes from decaying into negative - energy modes , all matter fields in the universe would decay instantly through tunneling into the negative - energy modes of such a scalar field .",
    "the theory is sick , and there is no cure .",
    "second , the equation of state is unbounded from below ( @xmath6 ) if the kinetic energy is not bounded .",
    "moreover , as the equation of state diverges , so does the sound speed , @xmath7 .",
    "this means that , besides potential problems with causality , the frequency of field oscillations diverges near the big - rip singularity .",
    "the only way to stop running into these divergences is if relativistic dynamics intervenes to stop the field from running to @xmath8",
    ". we will show in sec .",
    "iv that this is indeed possible .",
    "third , we give a simple proof of a known result @xcite which shows that phantom k - matter , with @xmath5 , can not cross the `` phantom barrier '' at @xmath9 if one assumes classical stability , @xmath10 .",
    "this means that if the equation of state is found to cross this barrier , then dark energy must be described by other fluid - like models @xcite or through non - minimal couplings to gravity @xcite .",
    "a minimal generalization of the usual canonical lagrangian is the so - called @xmath11-lagrangian , introduced initially to enlarge the class of inflationary models @xcite .",
    "later , they were also studied as dark energy models ( see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "any sensible phantom k - essence matter that can drive the super - acceleration of the universe should satisfy three criteria :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\a ) it should be a phantom field : @xmath12 in some spacetime volume .",
    "\\b ) classical solutions should be stable : the sound speed @xmath13 of classical perturbations of the field around homogeneous flrw solutions can not be negative .",
    "\\c ) quantum stability : the hamiltonian must be limited from below . evidently , any system with a hamiltonian which is unbounded from below would be instantly destroyed by quantum tunelling of positive - energy particles into the negative - energy particles . for theories with non - canonical kinetic terms ,",
    "the quantum stability is a nontrivial issue . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in what follows we will assume that the matter sector is represented by a k - essence scalar field lagrangian , which has the form :    [ lag ] = f(x)v ( ) , where :    [ def : x ] x 12 ^ _ , and we use the timelike metric signature , @xmath14 . for a canonical scalar field theory , @xmath15 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of this fluid reads : [ temini ]",
    "t_= = vf__-g_vf , where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath16 . in gaussian coordinates , which can be constructed in finite regions in general and globally if the topology of spacetime is @xmath17 , one can write : [ x ] x 12 g^00_0 _ 0 - 12 |g^ij| _ i _ j x_t - x_s , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are both non - negative .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads : [ ham ] = t^0_0=v ( 2 f[,x_s , ] x_t[,x_s , ] - f[,x_s , ] ) , where @xmath20 is the conjugated momentum .    in homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes @xmath21 , and we obtain : [ rho ] = t^0_0=v(2fx - f ) , and : [ p ] p=- t^i_i = vf , implying that : [ w ] w==- . hence , condition ( a ) , @xmath5 , yields : [ cond ] 0 < 2 x < 1 , or , equivalently : f>0 , f-2xf>0 & if & f>0 , + [ cond2 ] f<0 , f-2xf<0 & if & f<0 .",
    "the sound speed , @xmath13 , is the function appearing before spatial gradients in the scalar field equation - of - motion , @xmath22 , and for perturbations around homogeneous solutions , it is a function of time . the sound speed expresses the phase velocity of the inhomogeneous perturbations of the scalar field .",
    "therefore , to avoid exponentially growing solutions and thus ensure classical stability , we must have @xmath10 . on the other hand , to ensure causality in the usual sense the condition would be @xmath23 .",
    "however , since the theories we consider are perfectly lorentz invariant ( the superluminal propagation being just a consequence of the nonlinearity of the theory @xcite ) , we will only impose the first condition ( classical stability ) , as superluminal propagation can not be ruled out by observations if the scalar field is dark , i.e. , if it does not interact with normal matter .    for k - essence models",
    "the sound speed takes the simple expression @xcite : [ cs ] c_s^2== .",
    "condition ( b ) , that @xmath24 , implies : [ cond3 ] ( f^2 x)0 . in the subsequent subsections",
    "we will use the following relation between @xmath13 and @xmath25 coming from eqs .",
    "( [ w ] ) and ( [ cs ] ) : [ rel ] 1-= .    finally , condition ( c ) implies that @xmath26 must be bounded from below . as we will show in the next section",
    ", this is impossible given the two conditions above , eqs .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) .",
    "suppose initially that @xmath27 , so the function @xmath28 must be shown to be bounded from below . the conditions in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) are constraints on the function @xmath29 and its derivative , that do not depend on how @xmath16 is obtained from the phantom field ( or whether it is homogeneous or not )",
    ". that condition must be satisfied whenever @xmath30 ( which is the only constraint the restriction to homogeneous fields imposes on the possible values of the real variable @xmath16 ) , otherwise the homogeneous model would not yield a super - accelerated expansion , and it should be discarded . as @xmath31 , in order to have acceleration in the homogeneous background ( where @xmath30 ) , one must take from condition ( 10 ) the alternative @xmath32 and @xmath33 because we are now considering @xmath27 . hence , in this case , one must have from eq .",
    "( 10 ) that @xmath34 and @xmath35 for any given value @xmath36",
    ". we will show below that the subset of fluctuations that keeps @xmath30 constant , while varying @xmath18 and @xmath19 , is such that the hamiltonian is unbounded from below .",
    "this suffices to prove that the system is unstable .",
    "consider , then , quantum fluctuations such that @xmath16 is kept fixed , @xmath37 , but where @xmath18 can vary freely . in order for the hamiltonian to be bounded from below , one must have @xmath38 , where c is some finite constant .",
    "however , since @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fixed , the stronger the quantum fluctuation , the larger @xmath18 and therefore the hamiltonian is unbounded from below .    on the regions where @xmath41 the proof is similar .",
    "using the same reasoning , one now has that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and hence @xmath26 is unbounded from below because here @xmath44 is negative .",
    "notice that for @xmath45 , in the case of flrw backgrounds , the condition ( [ cond ] ) implies that @xmath46 .",
    "notice also that , within this class of lagrangians , the hamiltonians of the canonical and the born - infeld cases , respectively @xmath47 and @xmath48 , _ are _ bounded from below .",
    "however , these cases do not represent phantom fields .      from eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) one has :    [ rel3 ] c_s^2= .",
    "in order for @xmath49 we must have :    [ lim1 ] _ x[-2xw(x)]>_x|1+w|>0 .    we will prove by contradiction that one can not have @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a constant and @xmath52 .",
    "notice that : _ x [ -2xf(x)] & = & 2 _ x [ -f(x)-xf(x ) ] + & = & _ x [ -2xf(x ) ] + & > & |1+w_| , where we used eq.([lim1 ] ) and @xmath53 in the last step .",
    "xf(x ) & = & - 12 _ x [ ( -2x f(x))dx ] + & < & - 12 |1+w_|<0 , contradicting the hypothesis that @xmath52 . hence , for @xmath5 and @xmath49 we must have that : [ wlim ] _",
    "x w(x ) - .",
    "similarly , we can prove that the sound speed , @xmath13 , is also unbounded ( from above ) in phantom k - matter models .",
    "here it is useful to write eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) as :    [ rel4 ] c_s^-2= - .",
    "one can see that @xmath13 does not diverge if and only if the expression above does not goes to zero when @xmath54 , where , as we have proven above , @xmath55 .",
    "hence , for very large values of @xmath16 we have : [ den ] - 2() = h(x ) = h_min > 0 , where @xmath56 is the minimum value of @xmath57 for @xmath16 very large .",
    "however , from eq.([den ] ) , one could then write : [ dem ] _ x = h(x ) dx > h_min , which is contradiction with the previous result that @xmath58 . hence , @xmath59 .",
    "let us first consider cosmological solutions , for which @xmath61 . if @xmath5 , eq.([rel ] ) reads : [ rel1 ] 1+=- , and @xmath62 .",
    "this means that , as a function of @xmath16 the equation of state is a monotonically decreasing function .    on the other hand , if @xmath63 then eq.([rel ] ) reads : [ rel2 ] 1+= , and @xmath64 . in this case , @xmath25 as a function of @xmath16 is a monotonically increasing function .",
    "hence , @xmath25 can not cross the value @xmath60 if the sound speed is non - negative @xcite .",
    "in this section we present an example of a k - essence lagrangian where conditions ( a ) and ( b ) of sec .",
    "ii are satisfied , and in which no divergences of @xmath25 and @xmath13 appear .",
    "the kinetic function @xmath29 reads : [ toy ] f(x)=1+ax(1+x)-b(1-x^n)^n , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are some constants , @xmath67 is some positive half - integer , and @xmath68 is left arbitrary .",
    "general - relativistic dynamics constrain @xmath16 to the interval @xmath69 , because at @xmath70 and @xmath71 there are singularities in the derivatives of the curvature tensor . with @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for example",
    ", the equation of state remains bounded , @xmath75 , and the sound speed is always positive but finite , @xmath76  see fig .",
    "however , the parameter subspace where this occurs seems very small when compared to the full parameter space of this toy model .",
    "the three curves are , from top to bottom : @xmath77 ( black ) , the sound speed @xmath13 ( red ) , and the equation of state @xmath25 ( blue ) .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "we have shown in this paper that one can not obtain k - essence phantom models without quantum instabilities .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the phantom imposition , namely , @xmath78 for some range of @xmath79 , which in fact must be true for all values of @xmath16 if one imposes classical stability .",
    "hence , lagrangians of the type of eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) can not be considered as fundamental descriptions of phantom fields , being at most effective lagrangians aplicable to the cosmological set - up .",
    "we have also shown that classically stable k - essence phantom models present divergences of @xmath25 in the negative direction ( @xmath25 is bounded from above by @xmath9 , but unbounded from below ) , and of @xmath13 in the positive direction . these divergences occur unless @xmath80 is dynamically forbidden  either by limiting the range of @xmath16 in the lagrangian or by adjusting the potential @xmath68 .",
    "we have exhibited an example of a phantom k - essence lagrangian with the first property .",
