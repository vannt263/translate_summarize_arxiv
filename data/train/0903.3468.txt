    "in the nearby universe , galaxies have a bimodal color distribution , with a blue peak of star forming galaxies separated from a red sequence of quiescent galaxies by a sparsely populated gap @xcite .",
    "the number of red galaxies has roughly doubled since @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "red galaxies , on average , are more luminous than blue galaxies .",
    "therefore , a simple cessation of star formation in a fraction of the blue galaxies followed by fading and reddening can not explain this build - up of the red sequence .",
    "starbursts are often suggested as a way of increasing a blue galaxy s stellar mass before letting it fade onto the red sequence @xcite , with mergers and interactions as possible starburst triggers @xcite .",
    "mergers and starbursts have the additional appeal that they offer an explanation for the cessation of star formation : gas is being consumed by the starburst @xcite and is being expelled by agn or supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "thus , previously blue galaxies turn red and , through further dry mergers , can lead to the formation of the most massive elliptical galaxies observed in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "this prompted us to investigate the crucial but transient poststarburst phase , during which a galaxy crosses the color gap , of this particular evolutionary pathway .",
    "poststarburst galaxies ( psgs , or e+a galaxies ) have optical spectra with strong balmer absorption lines , revealing young stars , but faint if any emission lines , ruling out major star formation @xcite .",
    "psgs offer us a unique window on how starbursts affect galaxy evolution .",
    "the starburst population is fading but still quite prominent and we can study both the burst and the underlying intermediate - age and/or old stellar populations . due to their high surface brightness , we can study their stellar kinematics out to several half - light radii ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "clearly , the poststarburst phase is of crucial importance to furthering our understanding of the photometric evolution of the galaxy population .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present for the first time two - dimensional spatially - resolved kinematics and stellar population parameters for a gas - rich psg , selected from the @xcite catalog , . with a redshift @xmath4 , luminosity distance @xmath5  mpc ( adopting a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath6  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , distance modulus @xmath9  mag , and a spatial scale 1.27  kpc  arcsec@xmath1 ,",
    "this is a relatively nearby psg .",
    "the few galaxies with known systemic velocities in a 200  kpc wide search column centered on do not coincide in redshift and are spread over a very large redshift range ( @xmath10 ) , making it unlikely that they are physically connected with .",
    "we confirm the classification of by @xcite as a field psg .",
    "this is the first paper in a series based on our vlt / vimos observations of 3 psgs .",
    "the data have been obtained with the integral field unit ( ifu ) mode of the vimos spectrograph at eso / vlt - melipal by eso staff in mid-2006 . with the high - resolution `` hr - blue '' spectral setup ,",
    "the 0.67@xmath11 per lens spatial scale provides a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath12 ( 40@xmath1340  lenses ) .",
    "this setup offers a spectral resolving power @xmath14 between 4200 and 6300   . in total",
    ", we use eleven out of twelve obtained exposures , spatially dithered in order to work around broken ifu fibers , and each with an on - source time of 2,000  sec . the seeing fwhm varies between 0.7 and 1.2@xmath11 .",
    "arc line and flat field calibration frames have been taken for every observing block ( ob ) .",
    "for the data recuction , we use the generic ifu data reduction pipeline implemented in itt idl . a brief description of the data reduction steps can be found in @xcite .",
    "detailed information including all vimos - specific aspects concerning these data will be provided in a forthcoming paper .",
    "each of the four vimos quadrants , labeled q1 through q4 , of every ob was reduced independent from the others until the flux calibration step .",
    "the relative flux calibration of the quadrants is performed using twilight sky frames and requires extra care since we use spatial dithering .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was done using observations of spectrophotometric standards included in the standard vimos calibration plan .",
    "night sky spectra are reconstructed from the lenses outside 5  r@xmath15 of the galaxy to minimize contamination by the galactic stellar continuum and are subtracted from the science frames .",
    "then , individual exposures are co - added , applying iterative sigma - clipping to remove cosmic ray hits , spatial and spectral shifts to account for spatial dithering , different heliocentric corrections and atmosphere differential refraction .",
    "noise frames are computed using photon statistics and are processed through the same reduction steps as the science frames , up to the sky subtraction .",
    "we use twilight and science frames contaminated by moon ( 4 out of 12 ) to assess the data reduction quality and obtain quantitative estimates of the vimos spectral line spread function variations across the fov , along the wavelength axis , and between different obs .",
    "we fit the solar spectrum , taken from the elodie.3.1 stellar library @xcite , against the observed spectra in every lens at six wavelength intervals between 4000 and 6300 using the ppxf procedure @xcite . from this test",
    ", we conclude that ( 1 ) wavelength calibration quality is better than 5  km  s@xmath1 between 4000 and 5900 ; ( 2 ) spectral resolution ( @xmath16 ) exhibits no significant variations across the fov for individual quadrants , neither between observing blocks , although ( 3 ) it does change along wavelength ( 60 to 40  km  s@xmath1 from blue to red ) and between quadrants ; ( 4 ) high - order moments of the gauss - hermite parametrisation ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xcite ) are close to zero except q3 at @xmath19   , where @xmath17 is modestly negative due to imperfect focusing ; ( 5 ) systematic errors of the wavelength calibration become very important at @xmath20 , changing significantly between individual obs so we restrict our analysis to shorter wavelengths .",
    "we use the nbursts full spectral fitting technique @xcite with high - resolution ( @xmath21 ) pegase.hr @xcite simple stellar population ( ssp ) models to extract kinematics and stellar population from the absorption - line spectra .",
    "first , we rebin the data to a target signal - to - noise ratio of 15 per bin using the voronoi adaptive tessellation technique @xcite .",
    "we use only that part of the vimos ifu fov where the sky - subtraction uncertainty is sufficiently small , with a size of 18@xmath1318 lenses ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the subsequent fitting procedure comprises the following steps : ( 1 ) a grid of ssp spectra with a fixed set of ages ( spaced nearly logarithmically from 20  myr to 18  gyr ) and metallicities ( from @xmath232.0 to @xmath240.5  dex ) is convolved with the wavelength - dependent instrumental response of vimos in every voronoi tessella as explained in @xcite ; ( 2 ) a non - linear least square fitting against an observed spectrum is done for a template picked from the pre - convolved ssp grid using 2d - spline interpolation on age ( @xmath25 ) , and metallicity ( @xmath26 ) , broadened with the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) parametrized by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and multiplied pixel - by - pixel by an @xmath29 order legendre polynomial ( multiplicative continuum ) , resulting in @xmath30 parameters to be determined ( we use @xmath31 ) .",
    "we exclude narrow 12 - wide regions around the h@xmath32 , h@xmath33 , [ oiii ] ( @xmath34 ) , and [ ni ] ( @xmath35 ) lines from the fit in order to be able to detect faint emission lines . as shown in @xcite , reliable ssp - equivalent age and metallicity estimates",
    "are obtained even if the balmer absorption lines are excluded . using the approach described in @xcite we estimate the excluded regions to contain only @xmath36% of age - sensitive information .",
    "we present the maps derived from the full - spectrum fitting in fig  [ figmaps ] .",
    "those regions where the parameters have large uncertainties ( e.g. @xmath37  km  s@xmath1 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) or are not fit ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the outer regions ) are masked .",
    "the isophotes from the reconstructed continuum image ( datacube collapsed along the spectral dimension ) are shown as black solid contours .",
    "line - of - sight velocities can be determined with adequate precision out to larger radii from the galaxy centre than the velocity dispersion and the stellar population parameters , because they are insensitive to the sky subtraction .",
    "exhibits very regular , symmetric pure disc rotation with a semi - amplitude of 90  km  s@xmath1 without any evidence for significant isovelae twist .",
    "however , there is a significant misalignment of the kinematical and photometrical axes .",
    "we mention the evident large - scale bar oriented exactly along the galaxy s minor axis ( roughly north - south ) , which is visible on sdss images and also noticeable here in the reconstructed image .",
    "the rotation curve flattens out at @xmath38 from the centre , corresponding to @xmath39  kpc or @xmath40 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figrvpr ] ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion declines from a central maximum of @xmath41110  km  s@xmath1 to @xmath42  km  s@xmath1 at 6@xmath11 .",
    "the rather high @xmath43 in the outskirts of the galaxy also argue for the presence of a disc .",
    "one has to be careful with interpreting the high very central values , because a rapidly rotating circumnuclear component smeared by atmospheric seeing may produce very similar effects .",
    "weighing all the evidence , is best classified morphologically as a barred lenticular or sb0 galaxy .",
    "this is not surprising since , although the diversity is quite large , many e+as have s0-like morphologies @xcite .",
    "we use a technique similar to that proposed by @xcite to determine the galaxy s inclination , @xmath44 , and the position angle of the major axis , pa , from the stellar radial velocity field ( the main difference being the non - parametric representation of the rotation curve ) . fitting the velocity field in elliptical annuli in the radial range @xmath45",
    "gives pa@xmath46  deg and @xmath47  deg .",
    "these values agree well with the shape and axial ratio of the outer isophote displayed in fig  [ figmaps ] .",
    "the peak projected velocity @xmath48  km  s@xmath49 , after correcting for inclination effects , yields @xmath50  km  s@xmath1 for the mean tangential velocity .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath51 , provided by sdss , for the exponential scale - length of the stellar density profile . using these numbers",
    ", we estimate the circular velocity @xmath52 at a radius of 4@xmath11 , corrected for asymmetric drift using the method outlined in paragraph 4.8.2(a ) of @xcite .",
    "for the outskirts of the galaxy , we assume the rotation curve to be flat ( @xmath53 ) and the velocity dispersions to be independent of radius .",
    "we then arrive at the following expression for the circular velocity : @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the tangential velocity dispersion .",
    "unfortunately , along the major axis , @xmath28 is a function of both @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the vertical component of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "if we assume we are dealing with a thin disc then @xmath57 and @xmath58  km  s@xmath1 . in the case of an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor , @xmath59  km  s@xmath1 . the first case yields @xmath60 ; the latter leads to @xmath61 .",
    "the velocity width ( w20 ) of the hi 21  cm emission of this galaxy is @xmath62  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to a circular velocity @xmath63  km  s@xmath64  km  s@xmath1 ( buyle et al . , in prep . ) , sitting comfortably between the two extreme values derived from stellar kinematics .",
    "we will adopt it here as our best - guess value . using these numbers , we estimate the total dynamical mass within a 5  kpc radius at @xmath65  m@xmath66 .    with a total b - band absolute magnitude m@xmath67  mag ( buyle et al .",

    ", logarithm of the peak circular velocity @xmath68 , logarithm of the central velocity dispersion @xmath69 , sits exactly on the tully - fisher ( @xcite ) relation for elliptical and s0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is slightly offset from the e / s0 faber - jackson relation @xcite , being almost @xmath70  mag too bright in the b - band for its velocity dispersion .    in fig .",
    "[ figfp ] , we present the fundamental plane ( fp , @xcite ) in @xmath71-space @xcite . on the @xmath72  vs.  @xmath73 plot ( the plane s `` face - on view '' ) ,",
    "the distinct regions are occupied by dwarf @xcite and intermediate luminosity and giant early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the latter region is extended towards the upper - left corner of the plot by low - luminosity bulges and compact elliptical galaxies with m59co @xcite being the most extreme case .",
    ", indicated by the red filled circle , falls in the region occupied by high - surface brightness low - luminosity bulges and ellipticals .",
    "since the fp is defined for early - type galaxies ( e / s0 ) assumed to be virialised systems , we should include the rotational energy into the total balance at a first approximation as @xmath74 .",
    "this moves to the position indicated by the end of the green vector in fig  [ figfp ] , toward the locus of bright e / s0 galaxies .      in the stellar population maps ,",

    "@xcite observed using long - slit spectroscopy and found large h@xmath76 equivalent widths out to 2.5  arcsec .",
    "the vimos data confirm the existence of an extended region showing a young stellar population , although the positive age gradient is significant . for a comparison with the sdss dr6 spectrum @xcite of this galaxy ,",
    "we integrate the light in the data - cube inside a 3@xmath11 circular aperture and apply the full - spectrum fitting technique to both spectra .",
    "we find excellent agreement :  all the kinematical and stellar population parameters , including @xmath18 , are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we fit the brightest emission line ( [ oiii ] @xmath77 ) with a gaussian to determine its amplitude ( see fig  [ figspec]a ) .",
    "unfortunately , no precise measurements of radial velocities can be made due to the very low emission - line flux .",
    "the [ oiii ] emission is very centrally concentrated , arguing for the presence of a spatially unresolved emitting region .",
    "careful inspection of the fitting residuals in the central region ( fig  [ figspec]b ) reveals barely - detectable emission in the forbidden [ ni ] line ( @xmath78   ) , which is a typical signature of a liner or agn . we therefore connect the central peak of the [ oiii ] distribution to possible nuclear activity . fitting the sdss dr6 spectrum in the full wavelength range of pegase.hr ( @xmath79   ) and",

    "@xcite find that most of the hi gas in the binary psg system ea01a / b resides _ outside _ the stellar bodies of the galaxies , suggesting a feedback process powerful enough to physically displace large quantities of gas , such as agn feedback @xcite . at the same time , the faint h@xmath32 and [ oiii ] ( @xmath87 ) emission lines are detected almost everywhere out to @xmath88 from the galaxy centre , suggesting weak ongoing star formation over a large part of the galaxy .",

    "we estimate its @xmath90-band luminosity evolution using the pegase.2 @xcite evolutionary synthesis code . if we imagine evolving passively during this period , it will fade by , at maximum , 1  mag if all its stars formed 700  myr ago . in the more plausible case of a composite stellar population , the effect on the total @xmath90 magnitude will be even smaller , because the old population evolves slower than the young one , which has a lower mass fraction .",

    "on the other hand , a minor merger of a large disc - dominated lenticular or early - type spiral with an intermediate - mass gas - rich satellite may be an acceptable explanation : young stars will actively form in the disc from the accreted intermediate - metallicity ism while the central star formation peak will consume the metal - rich gas often present in the circumnuclear regions of early - type galaxies .    given the presence of neutral gas @xcite , the quenching of star formation in could very well be a transient phase .",
    "for instance , the gaseous component could have been dispersed by supernova or agn feedback and may re - accrete after several hundred myrs , possible restarting the star formation .",
    "if this object had been observed during a star - forming episode , it would have been classified as a barred late - type spiral ( sbcd ) .",
    "deep hi radio observations have led to the detection of 21  cm emission in about 60  per  cent of the targeted psgs @xcite .",
    "some of the detected psgs are as gas - rich as local lirgs and mergers , possible progenitors of psgs in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the presence of large quantities of gas indicates that many psgs might actually be observed during an inactive phase of the star - formation duty cycle .",
