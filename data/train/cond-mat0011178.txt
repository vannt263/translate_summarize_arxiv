    "the electronic transport properties in nano - size ferromagnetic structures has been drawing growing interest recently . of most interest would be the magnetoresistance effect , namely , the change of the resistance by application of a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetoresistance in nano - structures is due to the rearrangement of the magnetization , namely the creation and motion of domain walls , driven by the external field .",
    "recently high - sensitivity measurements on magnetic nano - structures such as wires and contacts has become possible and intensive experimental studies of the magnetoresistance due to a single domain wall have begun@xcite @xcite .",
    "these recent experiments have evoked a renewal of interest in theories of the scattering of the electron by a domain wall@xcite @xcite , although the first theoretical study of this problem goes back to more than 25 years ago@xcite .",
    "the scattering mechanism is due to the non - adiabatic deviation of the electron spin from the local magnetization as the electron goes through the wall . in the case of a wall with thickness @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the fermi wave length )",
    ", the electron spin can adiabatically follow the spatial rotation of the magnetization , resulting in a negligiblly small reflection .",
    "this is the reason the wall contributes very little in the magnetoresistance in the 3@xmath2 metals in the bulk@xcite .",
    "the situation changes in nano - magnets , where the profile of the wall can be different from that in the bulk magnets .",
    "the extreme case would be an atomic size contact .",
    "there the wall is believed to be constrained in a small contact region of an atomic scale due to a rapid change of the contact shape@xcite , and thus the adiabaticity does not hold resulting in a strong scattering@xcite .",
    "indeed an experiment on ni contact revealed a magnetoresistance of about 300% at room temperature@xcite , which is significantly large compared with other giant magnetoresistive materials such as multilayers .",
    "the result has been interpreted as due to a strong electron scattering by a domain wall , which is trapped in the narrow contact region in the absence of the magnetic field , and which is expelled by applying a magnetic field@xcite .    in this paper the domain wall resistance in nano - wires or contacts is calculated by use of landauer s formula .",
    "the advantage of this formalism is that we can see how the density of states of the sample and the lead appears in the resistance , which is not possible in he linear response calculation as carried out in ref .",
    "the system is treated as in one dimension and the calculation is at zero temperature .",
    "the transmission coefficients are calculated in section 2 , and the resistance is calculated in the case of four- and two - terminals in section 3 . the result is shown to agree with the result of the mori formula of the linear response theory in the case of the equilibrium flow in a four - terminal case .    throughout the paper we consider only channels which contribute to the transport and so do not discuss the quantized behavior of the conductance .",
    "the phase of the transmission coefficient contains important information on the stability of the electron system",
    ". this has been considered elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we consider the exchange interaction between the electron spin and the local spin .",
    "the hamiltonian is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the fermi energy ) .",
    "the spin index is denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the pauli matrix ( spin indices are suppressed in the second term ) .",
    "the local spin @xmath8 has a spatial dependence of a domain wall . in terms of a polar coordinate @xmath9",
    "the wall is represented as @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the thickness of the wall .",
    "we consider two typical profiles of the wall ; @xmath15 where the first case corresponds to the wall determined by the uniaxial anisotropy energy , which would be the case of bulk magnets , and the second linear profile would be realized in small contacts .",
    "to proceed we carry out a local gauge transformation in the electron spin space so that the @xmath16-axis is chosen to be along the local direction of spin @xmath17@xcite .",
    "the transformation is written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a position - dependent matrix defined as @xmath20 and the electron in the new frame is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian is transformed to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24is the energy of uniformly polarised electron with the exchange splitting @xmath25 .",
    "the term @xmath26 describes the interaction between the electron and the wall and is given by @xcite    @xmath27 , \\ ] ]    where    @xmath28    is a domain - wall form factor .",
    "note that @xmath29 for @xmath30 and so the interaction is localized near the wall .",
    "the spin - conserving process in the rotated frame as the electron goes through the wall corresponds to the adiabatic process , where the electron spin follows the rotation of the magnetization , and the spin flip corresponds to the deviation from the adiabaticity .",
    "the interaction @xmath26 leads to a scattering of the electron and thus contributes to a resistivity due to the wall as has been discussed before based on a linear response theory@xcite .",
    "here we take a different approach of calculating the @xmath31-matrix perturbatively with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation with the energy of @xmath32 , which we denote by @xmath33 ( two component vector corresponding to two spin state ) , is given as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the incoming wave , @xmath36 is the free green function with energy @xmath32 and @xmath31-operator is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "the small imaginary part in @xmath38 is to choose the correct boundary condition of outgoing wave .",
    "we consider the incoming wave with energy @xmath32 and spin @xmath39 .",
    "they are explicitly written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the wave vector of the spin @xmath39 component .",

    "the conservation of the current , @xmath63 is satisfied .",
    "to relate these quantities to resistance , we consider a four - terminal case where the system is coupled with two leads , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and two terminals , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ figterminal ] ) .",
    "( the gauge transformation does not affect the resistance , since the shift of the current due to the transformation vanishes far away from the wall . )",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath65 are connected with a reserver ( current source ) and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are to measure the voltage difference across the sample .",
    "the argument goes similarly to the non - magnetic case described in refs . @xcite but taking account of spin dependence .",
    "the chemical potential of @xmath68 and @xmath65 are fixed to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 is the applied voltage ) , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are determined below by the condition of vanishing current flow through each terminal .",
    "the true voltage difference across the sample is different from @xmath71 and is given as @xmath74 .",
    "the resistance of the system is written as @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the current through the sample .",
    "we first consider the case where the leads are ferromagnets with density of states for the spin state @xmath39 given by @xmath77 .",
    "the case of non - magnetic leads is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "the number of the electron with spin @xmath39 injected from @xmath68 is @xmath78 , and thus the electric current is written by use of transmission probability as @xmath79 the voltage @xmath72 and @xmath73 are determined by the balance between the terminal and lead . in @xmath68 , the density ( per energy ) of spin @xmath39 electron is written as @xmath80 here a factor of @xmath81 comes from choosing right moving electron .",

    "naively it appears correct to choose @xmath88 , equal to the one - dimensional density of state .",
    "this is wrong if the equilibrium situation with a steady current flow is considered .",
    "in fact , the electron with down spin , which has a smaller velocity of @xmath89 , can not leave the scattering region quickly after the scattering and thus the density becomes higher by a factor proportional to @xmath90 ( see fig .",
    "[ figdensity ] ) . therefore under a steady flow ,",
    "the effective density of states becomes proportional to @xmath91 , namely , @xmath92 , where a prefactor is chosen to conserve the total density , i.e. , @xmath93 .",

    "( [ ieq ] ) with @xmath96 , divided by the applied voltage , @xmath97 .",
    "thus @xmath98 the wall resistance is written as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the conductance without the wall .",

    "[ figr ] for the two profiles , ( [ bulkwall ] ) and ( [ dwprofiles ] ) . in the bulk case , ( [ bulkwall ] )",
    ", @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 and so resistance decays rapidly for @xmath105 . in the case of a linear wall , ( [ dwprofiles ] ) ,",
    "decay is slower ( fig .",
    "[ figr ] ) ; @xmath106 this difference in the form factor leads to a slightly different resistance , but strong suppression of the resistance for @xmath107 is universal .",
    "the difference between the two- and four - terminal cases is small if the zeeman splitting is large but becomes manifest when @xmath108 is small .",
    "let us mention the case where the leads connected to the sample are non - magnetic metals . if we write the hopping probability between the lead and the sample as @xmath109 , the balance of the density of states requires @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the density of states in the lead .",
    "thus the voltage across the sample is determined by the same eqs . as ( [ n1])-([muab ] ) , and so the resistance is equal to that for the ferromagnetic lead discussed above .",
    "the scattering of the electron by a domain wall is studied theoretically . by use of a local gauge transformation ,",
    "the interaction between the electron and the wall is treated perturbatively to the lowest order .",
