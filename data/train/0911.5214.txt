    "the understanding of plasma equilibria is one of the most important problems in magnetohydrodynamics and arises in several fields including solar physics and thermonuclear fusion .",
    "such an equilibria is often governed by the well known steady hydromagnetic equations @xmath0 which describe the balance of the lorentz force by pressure . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the magnetic field and the pressure .",
    "notice that system ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) is quite similar to steady inviscid fluid equations @xmath3 this analogy is due to the vectorial identity @xmath4 system of equations ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) must be completed with some boundary conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "physical considerations suggest to prescribe the boundary normal field component : @xmath5 where @xmath6 satisfies the compatibility condition @xmath7 due to the equation @xmath8 . defining the inflow boundary as @xmath9 one can also prescribe the normal component @xmath10 of the current density and the pressure @xmath2 on @xmath11 @xmath12",
    "@xmath13 one can notice that if the pressure is neglected , equations ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) become @xmath14 equation ( [ eqn : fff ] ) means that the magnetic field and its curl , which represents the current density , are everywhere aligned .",
    "the magnetic field is said _ beltrami _ or _ force - free _ ( ff ) . a usual way to tackle the problem ( [ eqn : fff ] ) + ( [ eqn : div2 ] ) consists to rewrite equation ( [ eqn : fff ] ) into the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a scalar function which can be a constant function or can depend on @xmath17 . in the former",
    ", the @xmath1 field is said linear ff . in the latter ,",
    "it is said non linear . + some partial results concerning existence of 3d solutions of equations ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) in bounded domains are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "linear force - free - fields were studied in @xcite . for the existence of non - linear ones the reader can refer to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the numerical solving of equations ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) and equations ( [ eqn : fff])+([eqn : div2 ] ) is of importance in magnetohydrodynamics studies and in solar physics . as it is known , the reconstruction of the coronal magnetic field has is of a great utility in observational and theoretical studies of the magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere . in this paper",
    ", we propose an iterative process for solving these equations ( section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "a finite element method is proposed for solving each one of the arising problems .",
    "our objective here is to expose an iterative method for solving the non - linear equations ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) in a bounded and simply - connected domain .",
    "the starting idea of the method consists to split the current density @xmath18 into the sum @xmath19 where the vector field @xmath20 is collinear to @xmath1 , while @xmath21 is perpendicular to @xmath1 .",
    "the problem is decomposed formally into a curl - div system on @xmath22 and two first order hyperbolic equations on @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "+ more precisely , writing @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a scalar function and taking the divergence of ( [ omega123 ] ) , gives @xmath27 notice that the pressure satisfies a similar equation since @xmath28 equation ( [ eqn : ms ] ) becomes @xmath29 which means that @xmath30 if @xmath31 .    in consideration of these remarks",
    ", we are going now to propose an iterative process to solve non - linear systems ( [ eqn : ms])+([eqn : div1 ] ) . in this process the transport equation ( [ eqn : mu ] ) is perturbed by adding an artificial reaction term .",
    "namely , we construct a sequence @xmath32 as follows :    * the starting guess @xmath33 is chosen as the irrotational field associated to @xmath6 defined by @xmath34 this is a usual problem which can be reduced to a scalar neumann problem since the domain is simply - connected .",
    "* for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 is solution of the system @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a small parameter and @xmath39 . * for all @xmath35 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a small parameter .",
    "* for all @xmath35 , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 solution of @xmath48 where @xmath49 while @xmath50 is solution of the laplace problem @xmath51    notice that the appearance of the correction term @xmath52 is due to the fact that @xmath53 is not zero in general .",
    "+ the convergence of this iterative process is not an easy matter .",
    "we conjecture that it converges if @xmath54 is sufficiently small and @xmath55 in @xmath56 for some constant @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of linear force - free fields ( in that case the algorithm is simplified since at each iteration @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath42 is a fixed real ) boulmezaoud and amari @xcite proved that this process is super - convergent .",
    "the proof of convergence in the general case is not given and remains an open question .",
    "+ notice that the same algorithm can be used for computing linear or non - linear force - free fields which are solutions of ( [ eqn : div2])+([eqn : fff2 ] ) , provided that the computation of the pressure @xmath36 and the vector field @xmath60 are dropped .",
    "here we give a short description of the finite elements methods we use for solving problems arising in the iterative process exposed above .",
    "observe first that at each iteration of the algorithm one should solve two problems : + ( a ) a reaction - convection problem of the form : _ find @xmath61 solution of _",
    "@xmath62 ( b ) a vector potential problem : _ find the pair @xmath63 satisfying _ @xmath64 we begin with the approximation of ( [ eqn : hyperbolic ] ) .    it is well known that the direct application of a galerkin finite elements method to the singularly perturbed problem ( [ eqn : hyperbolic ] ) may lead to the appearance of spurious oscillations and instabilities . in the two last decades",
    ", several methods were proposed to remove this drawback ( especially in the two dimensional case ) . among these methods",
    ", one can recall the _ streamline diffusion _ method ( see brookes and hughes @xcite , see also , e. g. , johnson et _ al . _",
    "@xcite ) , the _ discontinuous _ galerkin method ( see lesaint @xcite ) and _ bubble functions _ methods ( see , e. g. , brezzi et _ al . _ @xcite ) . here",
    "we shall use the method of streamline diffusion .",
    "thus , let us consider a family of regular triangulations @xmath65 of @xmath56 .",
    "the discrete problem we consider is @xmath66 where @xmath67 here @xmath68 stands for the finite elements space @xmath69 where for each @xmath70 , @xmath71 denotes the space of polynomials of degree less or equal @xmath72 .",
    "+ one can prove that the problem @xmath73 has a unique solution @xmath74 when @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath76 for some constant @xmath77 and if @xmath78 and @xmath79 for some @xmath80 , then @xmath81 where @xmath82 + now , we deal with the approximation of the curl - div system ( [ eqn : systemb ] ) , which can be dispatched into two problems : a variational problem ( @xmath83 ) in terms of @xmath84 and the fictitious unknown @xmath85 , and laplace equation ( [ eqn : lap_cor ] ) in terms of @xmath86 .",
    "we only deal with the approximation of @xmath84 , since we shall see that the computation of the @xmath86 is useless .",
    "denote by @xmath87 the space @xmath88 equipped with its usual norm .",
    "the statement of problem ( [ eqn : systemb ] ) suggests the use of an @xmath87 approximation .",
    "define @xmath89 the space @xmath90 let @xmath91 , @xmath92 two finite - dimensional subspaces and set @xmath93 we make the following assumptions @xmath94 @xmath95 the discrete version of problem ( [ eqn : systemb ] ) writes @xmath96 according to amrouche and _",
    "@xcite , the problem @xmath97 has one and only one solution @xmath98 with @xmath99 , and @xmath100 a simple manner for constructing the spaces @xmath101 and @xmath102 is to use the @xmath103 conforming elements of ndelec @xcite ( see amrouche and _ al . _ ) . in that case , the following estimate holds @xmath104 .",
    "+ an important feature of the discrete system @xmath97 is that only the discrete vector field @xmath105 is really unknown . actually , we know that @xmath106",
    ". this property can be exploited from a practical viewpoint to reduce the discrete system to a smaller one by eliminating @xmath107 . in term of matrices ,",
    "the system writes @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a symmetric and positive square matrix ( @xmath109 is not definite neither invertible ) .",
    "we can state the following    [ matrix_lemma ] let @xmath110 be a square positive , definite and symmetric matrix having the same size as @xmath111 .",
    "then , the pair @xmath112 is solution of ( [ eqn : syst ] ) if and only if @xmath113 and @xmath114 is solution of @xmath115    in lemma [ matrix_lemma ] , the matrix @xmath109 and the rhs @xmath116 are not arbitrary . indeed , if @xmath117 denotes the matrix of the operator @xmath118 , then necessarily @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "these identities are the discrete counterpart of the continuous relations @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "a serious advantage of the new system ( [ eqn : dec_syst ] ) comparing with ( [ eqn : syst ] ) is that number of unknowns is reduced .",
