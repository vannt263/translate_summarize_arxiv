    "the evolution from a liquid to a crystal structure is one of the oldest problems in condensed matter , with wide interest in both basic science and technology @xcite . in three - dimensional space",
    "the mechanism of crystallization is still a matter of ongoing research . since in general the seeds for",
    "nucleation do not have the same symmetry as the equilibrium structure , the early process of crystallization is a competition among different intermediate metastable states @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , in 2d flat space",
    "the physics behind crystallization is much simpler because there is no frustration to nucleating the equilibrium structure , such that there is no need for intermediate precursors @xcite .",
    "however , two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals deposited on curved surfaces come back to complexity . here",
    "the underlying curvature locally frustrates the formation of the crystal lattice , modifying both equilibrium structures @xcite-@xcite and their dynamical properties @xcite , @xcite .",
    "curved crystalline structures are ubiquitous in nature . for example , they can be found in viral capsids , insect eyes , pollen grains , and radiolaria . during the last decade",
    "these crystals have attracted the interest of different communities because of the richness associated with the coupling between geometry , structure , and functionality .",
    "recently , curved crystals have been obtained in a controlled fashion by the use of colloidal matter @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other self - assembled systems with great potential to develop such structures are block copolymers and liquid crystals @xcite-@xcite . in curved crystals",
    ", defects can be a feature of the fundamental ( equilibrium ) state .",
    "depending on the substrate s topology and curvature , defects can be required to reduce lattice distortions and to satisfy topological constraints .",
    "thus , from a condensed matter perspective , the presence of curvature in ordered phases appears as an opportunity for accurate control of the density and location of topological defects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although theoretical and experimental work has led to a substantial advance in the knowledge of equilibrium structures and features , the out - of - equilibrium dynamics leading to the formation of curved crystals , highly relevant for technological applications like defect functionalization engineering or soft lithography , remain almost unexplored .    in this work",
    "we use a free energy functional that includes competing interactions to describe the large - scale dissipative dynamics of crystallization in systems residing on curved backgrounds .",
    "this simple model captures the essential features of crystallization over diffusive time scales and provides a clear picture about the complex coupling between geometry and crystallinity .",
    "we focus on the long time dynamics of the system which is governed by the formation , interaction and annihilation of topological defects .",
    "the process of crystallization in curved space can be described by the following free energy functional : @xmath0 \\\\- & \\frac{b}{2}\\int\\int d^2r \\ , d^2r ' \\ , \\sqrt{g } \\ , \\sqrt{g ' } \\,g(\\textbf{r}-\\textbf{r}')\\,\\psi(\\textbf{r})\\,\\psi(\\textbf{r } ' ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is an order parameter related to fluctuations of the density from the average , @xmath2 is a double - well potential that below the critical temperature presents two minima , @xmath3 is a penalty to form interfaces , @xmath4 is the determinant of the metric @xmath5 of the curved substrate , and @xmath6 is a green s function which takes into account long - range interactions leading to the formation of a local hexagonal structure .",
    "equation 1 is the covariant generalization of models widely used to study properties of systems with competing interactions with direct applications to a large collection of condensed systems : block copolymers , crystals , magnetic multilayer compounds , rayleigh - benard convection patterns , and doped mott insulators @xcite , @xcite , among others .",
    "close to the critical line , eq .",
    "1 reduces to the landau - brazovsky free energy functional which has been employed for years in the understanding of the liquid to crystal transition in euclidean space .",
    "the dynamics leading to crystallization can be analyzed by considering the temporal evolution of a liquid phase quenched below the critical temperature , through the evolution equation : @xmath7    here @xmath8 is a phenomenological mobility coefficient , and @xmath9 is the laplace - beltrami operator which reduces to the classical laplacian in flat geometries ( see the appendix for details on the evolution equation and numerical methods ) .    in this work we focus on the crystallization of hexagonal systems residing on sinusoidal substrates of different curvatures ( figure 1a ) , characterized by an amplitude @xmath10 and a wavelength @xmath11 larger than the lattice constant in the crystal . in general , for every regular point @xmath12 on the surface there are two tangent circles with maximal and minimal radii of curvature @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the gaussian curvature @xmath15 at @xmath12 is then defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the principal curvatures .",
    "the gaussian curvature represents the intrinsic curvature of the surface . in the geometry",
    "studied here it takes on negative ( positive ) values in the neighborhood of the saddles ( crests or valleys ) .",
    "regions of zero gaussian curvature correspond to points resembling the flat euclidean plane .",
    "note that for these surfaces the curvature is symmetrically distributed ( see figure 1b ) , such that the integrated curvature is zero .",
    "thus , this system is topologically equivalent to the plane , such that no defects are geometrically required to form the crystal lattice ; defect structures , if any , must arise only from energetic considerations .     is the maximum curvature .",
    "c ) delaunay triangulations are used to identify the topological defects like negative ( left ) and positive ( center ) disclinations , and dislocations ( right).,width=7 ]    upon crystallization , the positions of the particles can be determined through the local maxima in the order parameter function @xmath18 .",
    "once the particles positions are known , the temporal evolution of the coordination number , particles first neighbors , degree of crystallinity , pair correlation function , and topological defects can be analyzed through delaunay triangulations ( see the appendix for supplementary information about the method used to obtain delaunay triangulations on curved surfaces ) .",
    "the most common defects of a hexagonal flat crystal are given by particles whose coordination number differs from six ( fig .",
    "1c ) @xcite .",
    "five- and seven - coordinated particles , named positive and negative disclinations , respectively , are deeply involved in the high temperature behavior of 2d crystals and also unavoidably created during a symmetry - breaking liquid - to - crystal transition . in flat systems these topological defects are highly energetic because they produce large distortions in the crystal lattice . consequently , in flat crystals disclinations",
    "are not found isolated but are arranged in dipoles , known as dislocations ( fig .",
    "1c ) . on the contrary , on curved substrates",
    "the disclinations can help to screen out the geometric frustration induced by the substrate s geometry , reducing the elastic distortions generated by the curvature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , in curved crystals the disclinations are _ not _ necessarily defects as they can belong to the equilibrium state of the crystal .",
    "* crystal patch formation : * the formation of the crystal order can be analyzed through the bond - orientational order parameter @xmath19 for each particle @xmath20 , where the sum runs over the @xmath21 nearest neighbors of particle @xmath20 , and @xmath22 is the angle between the @xmath23 bond and a fixed direction .",
    "this order parameter takes a value @xmath24 for a liquid particle , and @xmath25 for a crystal particle .",
    "sequences 2a and 2b show the early crystallization process from an initial liquid , on two differently curved substrates ( in fig .",
    "2a @xmath26 , and in fig 2b @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the lattice constant ) . to better visualize the crystal regions , here",
    "we have superimposed the bond order parameter maps @xmath29 with the particles .",
    "note that in both cases the formation of hexagonal order ( red regions ) starts in the flatter regions of the substrate .",
    "in flat systems the initial crystal seeds of a liquid - solid transition are randomly distributed throughout the system @xcite , @xcite . on the contrary , here the curvature breaks the isotropy of space , and the formation of hexagonal patches is favored on regions where the gaussian curvature is small .",
    "this is a consequence of the geometrical frustration created by the curvature , where the geometry produces distortions that increase the strain energy in the lattice , inhibiting the formation of perfectly hexagonal patches in regions of high curvature .",
    "this phenomenon can be clearly observed by studying the distribution of the crystal order parameter @xmath29 as a function of the local value of the gaussian curvature @xmath15 .",
    "figures 3a and 3b show @xmath29 for early and long times during the crystallization on substrates of increasing curvature .",
    "since the geometric frustration is reduced by disclinations that locally reduce crystallinity , by increasing the maximum curvature @xmath30 the crystallinity becomes sharply peaked around the flatter regions ( @xmath31 ) at early and long times .",
    "note that as the curvature of the system is increased , the confinement of crystal seeds to regions of low curvature is stronger .",
    "the global process of crystallization can be tracked through the fraction of particles involved in crystals , @xmath32 .",
    "figure 3c shows the temporal evolution of @xmath33 .",
    "this plot shows that the dynamics become slower and the fraction of crystallized particles decreases by increasing the curvature .",
    "thus , the curvature not only frustrates the formation of hexagonal domains in regions of high curvature , but also affects the dynamics towards the equilibrium state .     as a function of the gaussian curvature @xmath15 at times @xmath34 ( a ) and @xmath35 ( b ) .",
    "the curves corresponds to different substrates ( curvatures indicated in the figure ) .",
    "c ) temporal evolution of the crystal fraction @xmath33 .",
    "here @xmath28 is the lattice constant.,width=8 ]        * defect structures : * we observed that the early crystalline seeds grow through the addition of new hexagonally packed particles , invading the rest of the substrate .",
    "however , the growth is not homogeneous and the crystals grow preferentially faster along regions of low curvature . at intermediate time scales , where the system remains far from equilibrium , we observed defect configurations similar to those observed in curved colloidal crystals ( fig .",
    "the different structures of defects that participate in the dynamics of crystallization are dislocations , pleats ( linear arrays of dislocations with variable distance between them @xcite ) , free disclinations , and scars ( linear arrays of dislocations and disclinations with a net topological charge ) @xcite . during crystallization in flat space , the domain structure is dominated by triple points ( regions where three grains meet ) @xcite , @xcite ; isolated disclinations are absent @xcite , @xcite . however , due to curvature , here the triple points become unstable and the mechanism of domain growth produces scars and pleats ( see fig .",
    "4 ) decorating the interface between grains having a large orientational mismatch , while free disclinations are rapidly stabilized in the highly curved regions in order to screen the geometric potential @xcite .",
    "* pair correlations : * the relaxation towards the ordered crystal requires the annihilation of the excess defects , while keeping the total topological charge equal to zero . a standard tool to study the ordering process is the pair correlation function @xmath36 , giving the probability of finding a particle at distance @xmath37 away from a reference particle @xcite ( see appendix c ) . for a perfectly ordered crystal ,",
    "@xmath36 is a periodic array of @xmath38 functions whose positions and heights are determined by the lattice order . since disorder strongly affects the peak structure , it has been previously found that @xmath36 can be employed to study the degree of ordering .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath36 for a highly curved substrate ( @xmath39 ) at early and long times .",
    "the process of ordering is evidenced by the sharpening of higher - order peaks in @xmath36 , which correspond to the peak structure found for a hexagonal lattice ( peaks located at @xmath40 ) . when comparing @xmath36 at a fixed time , we observe that the amplitude of the first peak in @xmath36 systematically decreases upon increasing the maximum curvature @xmath30 . however ,",
    "unlike other systems where the degree of order affects the distribution of peak heights , here we observe that the ratio between peak heights is relatively insensitive to the curvature ( inset of fig .",
    "thus , although at high curvatures the system contains a number of isolated disclinations and other defect structures , their highly energetic elastic distortions are deeply relaxed by the geometry .     at short ( gray ) and long ( blue ) times for a highly curved substrate ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "inset : @xmath36 for systems of increasing curvature ( @xmath42).,width=8 ]    * defect evolution and correlation length : * the coarsening dynamics can also be elucidated by tracking the motion and distribution of topological defects . at early times",
    ", the disorder in the lattice screens out the local curvature , producing a roughly random distribution of defects throughout the system @xcite . at this early stage",
    "the dynamics are relatively unaffected by the curvature and thus , the process of defect annihilation can be expected to follow  line - tension - driven \" allen - cahn dynamics @xcite , @xcite . as time proceeds ,",
    "most defects condense along domain walls in pleats and scars , while their dynamics of diffusion and annihilation are deeply influenced by both isolated disclinations @xcite , @xcite and curvature .",
    "the sequence of fig .",
    "6a shows the mechanism of ordering most often observed in regions of high curvature . here",
    "the partially screened strain field of the disclinations located at the bumps acts as a sink for linear arrays of defects , that diffuse and annihilate at these highly curved regions .",
    "the analysis of the defect structures and the annihilation mechanism reveals that in addition to the local traps produced by regions of positive ( negative ) curvature for the motion of positive ( negative ) disclinations , a slow _ glassy - like _ ordering results from the pinning of linear arrays of defects to regions of low curvature .",
    "figure 4e shows a typical pinning of a domain wall connecting negative disclinations , located at saddle points .",
    "we found that the deep traps produced by the regions of low curvature generate very stable domain structures that dramatically slow down dynamics by freezing the ordering kinetics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note however , that this slowing down is not produced by the formation of a glassy phase , but rather related to an arrested state , which is unable to reach equilibrium .",
    "although in euclidean space the slow dynamics of systems with competing interactions has for years been related to the formation of glasses , recent results indicate that the dynamics in the two cases would be intrinsically different @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this slowing down in the dynamics can be tracked through the time evolution of the areal density of dislocations @xmath43 ( figure 6b ) .",
    "it can be observed that in agreement with the results shown in fig .",
    "3c , at short times the dynamics are relatively insensitive to the curvature while a clear coupling with the geometry appears at intermediate and long times . in this regime , upon increasing the maximum curvature , the rate of defect annihilation decreases and larger contents of defects are involved in the relaxation process .",
    "since defect structures mainly decorate domain walls , a characteristic length scale @xmath44 , defined in terms of @xmath43 as @xmath45 , provides a measure of the average domain size @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "@xmath46 is the average distance between dislocations along a domain wall . in coarsening systems where a free energy barrier @xmath47 is involved in the growth of the domains ,",
    "the rate of change of the correlation length takes the form @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "since here the energy excess is produced mainly by the domain walls , we have @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a free energy parameter characterizing the strength of the barrier . solving for @xmath44 ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath44 becomes @xmath51 .",
    "figure 6c shows the temporal evolution of @xmath52 for substrates with different curvature @xmath30 .",
    "in agreement with an activated mechanism , here we find that in the long - time regime , @xmath44 is consistent with a logarithmic dependence on time .",
    "we also found that the mean - square displacement of the particles is consistent with a logarithmic behavior .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "6c also shows the dependence of @xmath53 as a function of the maximum curvature of the substrate @xmath30 .",
    "the activation energy for a flat system has also been included for comparison . in agreement with the qualitative observations",
    ", the activation energy grows continuously with the maximum curvature , indicating that the pinning of defects becomes stronger for larger curvatures .",
    "however , the dependence on curvature is relatively weak , with @xmath53 following a power law @xmath54 with a relatively small exponent ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "in this work we have studied how the mechanisms of formation of a two - dimensional crystal phase are modified by the presence of curvature .",
    "we observed that order is triggered earlier on the flattest regions of the substrate , where the frustration in the lattice due to the curvature is smaller .",
    "the frustration to form the crystal induced by the geometry of the substrate can be partially reduced by different topological defect structures .",
    "the ordering mechanism of curved polycrystals show ordering mechanisms somewhat similar to those of their flat counterparts , modified by curvature .",
    "as the coupling between varying curvature and crystal order induces the pinning of grain boundaries , glassy - like dynamics arise which may completely inhibit the appearance of the ground state structure .",
    "these dynamic effects should be taken into account not only at the onset of a phase transition during crystallization or melting , but also in the design of applications that require well - ordered self - assembled structures , like surfaces functionalized with ordered arrays of topological defects .",
    "this work was supported by the national research council of argentina , conicet , anpcyt , universidad nacional del sur and the national science foundation mrsec program through the princeton center for complex materials ( dmr-0819860 ) .",
    "by combining the free energy functional ( eq .",

    "the parameters of the free energy and the number of lattice points of the numerical grid are chosen such that the particle diameter is represented by at least @xmath64 lattice points .",
    "the initial liquid phase is modelled by random fluctuations in the order parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of particles during crystallization is followed by the identification and tracking of the maxima of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , the dominant features of the system can be analyzed by the use of delaunay triangulation @xcite . through the triangulation , it is possible to obtain structural parameters such as the particle s first neighbors , degree of crystallinity , or topological defects @xcite-@xcite .",
    "once the positions of the particles are determined , the analysis starts by calculating each particle s first neighbors . to do that",
    ", we implemented the fast marching algorithm @xcite . here a propagating front starting from each particle is obtained by solving the evolution equation ( figs . 7a and 7b ) .",
    "@xmath65 where @xmath66 is the propagation velocity ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the resulting function @xmath68 gives the distance to the initial point , such that the geodesic distance between two arbitrary points on the surface is easily determined .    with the geodesic distances between particles we construct the voronoi diagrams and delaunay triangulations and",
    "also locate the particles first neighbors and determine their coordination numbers @xmath69 ( figs .",

    "in curved space , the pair correlation function @xmath36 can be generalized as the average number of particles with geodesic distances between @xmath37 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "figure 8a shows a scheme of the calculation of @xmath36 through the use of geodesic circles . here",
    "the spatial correlations between the particle s locations produce peaks in @xmath36 at characteristic distances @xmath71 related to the lattice structure ( fig .",
    "contrary to @xmath72 or flat @xmath73 systems , or to homogeneously curved systems ( spheres or pseudospheres ) , on sinusoidal substrates one should question whether it is proper to simply average @xmath36 calculated for different particles , because the varying curvature breaks the homogeneity of space .",
    "however , as shown in fig . 8b , we have only found small differences in @xmath36 when calculated with reference particles located in curved or flat regions .",
    "thus , the average of @xmath36 for the different particles represents a good measure of the state of order of the system .",
    "the regularity in the lattice structure , producing similar pair correlations independent of the reference particle s location , comes from the ability to pack topological defects in the most curved regions of the substrate .",
