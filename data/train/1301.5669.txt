    "et al _ @xcite initiated the application of the `` partial wave - cutoff method '' , to be explained below , to the important class of @xmath0 symmetric fields first introduced by s. l. adler @xcite .",
    "we will work in euclidean metric with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a t hooft symbol , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in general , @xmath5 may be any arbitrary spherically symmetric function .",
    "however , the profile we have chosen for @xmath5 has the following important properties :    * @xmath6 is finite . *",
    "@xmath7 , which is what we need to see the chiral anomaly term @xmath8 .",
    "according to m. fry @xcite , the following general remarks hold for the spinor qed effective action in the background ( [ defbackground ] ) with @xmath9 : let @xmath10 denote the ( scheme independent ) effective action obtained after subtraction of the two - point contribution .",
    "it behaves for small @xmath11 as @xmath12 the logarithmic term is determined entirely by the chiral anomaly , @xmath13",
    "after decomposing the negative chirality part of the dirac operator into partial - wave radial operators with quantum numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the corresponding effective action is : @xmath16 we concentrate on the negative chirality sector of the spinor effective action where @xmath17 is the degeneracy factor , and the @xmath18 sum comes from adding the contributions of each spinor component .",
    "the partial - wave cutoff method separates the sum over the quantum number @xmath14 into a low partial - wave contribution , each term of which is computed using the ( numerical ) gelfand - yaglom method , and a high partial - wave contribution , whose sum is computed analytically using wkb .",
    "then we apply a regularization and renormalization procedure and combine these two contributions to yield the finite and renormalized effective action . the gelfand - yaglom method @xcite ,",
    "can be summarized as follows : let @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote two second - order radial differential operators on the interval @xmath21 and let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be solutions to the initial value problem @xmath24 then the ratio of the determinants is given by @xmath25 in our case @xmath26    \\right ) \\phi_{-}(r ) & = & 0 \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the high - mode contribution , which remains to be calculated calculated using wkb , is @xmath27",
    "for the class of backgrounds considered here , the partial - wave - cutoff method works well for any value of the mass up to numerical accuracy . the effective action calculated as above",
    "is finite for any non - zero value of the mass .",
    "when we use on - shell ( ` os ' ) renormalization ( @xmath28 ) , its leading small - mass behavior contains the logarithmically divergent term @xcite @xmath29 thus for the study of this small @xmath11 regime we introduce a modified effective action , @xmath30 it turns out that @xmath31 is finite for @xmath32 , which supports fry s conjecture , mentioned above , for the case of the backgrounds with @xmath33 ( where the chiral anomaly term is absent ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we contrast both variants of the effective action for the scalar qed case ( see @xcite for the fermionic case which is very similar ) .",
    "in this section we exhibit the leading and subleading terms in the inverse mass (= heat kernel ) expansion of the one - loop scalar qed effective action .",
    "the first two terms are ( we calculated them using the worldline formalism along the lines of @xcite ) @xmath34 where the coefficients in the limit @xmath35 are , up to cubic order in @xmath36 , @xmath37 the large - mass behavior of the effective action is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the scalar qed case ( see @xcite for the fermionic case ) .",
    "in this section we show that the four - point contribution to the effective action in the `` standard '' @xmath0 symmetric background , ( [ defbackground ] ) with @xmath9 and @xmath38 , is finite in the massless limit .",
    "this is a detail of some importance for fry s investigation that had been missing in the analysis of @xcite , although it has been anticipated in @xcite . in the worldline formalism",
    ", we can write this quartic contribution to the effective action as ( in either scalar or spinor qed ) @xmath39 = -\\prod_{i=1}^4 \\int \\frac{d^4k_i}{(2\\pi)^4}\\bar a(k_i^2 ) ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta^4(\\sum k_i ) \\gamma[k_1,\\varepsilon_1;\\cdots;k_4,\\varepsilon_4]\\ ; , \\label{gamma4fin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the worldline path integral representation of the off - shell euclidean four - photon amplitude and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . after performing the path integral , suitable integrations by parts , a rescaling @xmath43 and the elimination of the global @xmath44 integral , we obtain ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath45 = -\\frac{e^4}{(4\\pi)^2 }   \\int_0 ^ 1 du_1du_2 du_3 du_4\\ \\frac{q_4(\\dot g_{b12},\\ldots,\\dot g_{b34 } ) } { \\bigl(m^2 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j=1}^4 g_{bij}k_i\\cdot k_j\\bigr)^2}\\;. \\label{4photfin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath46 is the worldline green s function and @xmath47 its derivative .",
    "@xmath48 is a polynomial in the various @xmath49 s , as well as in the momenta and polarizations .",
    "now , the qed ward identity implies that the rhs of ( [ 4photfin ] ) is @xmath50 in each of the four momenta , which can also be easily verified using properties of the numerator polynomial @xmath48 .",
    "using this fact and ( [ gamma4fin ] ) we see that there is no singularity at @xmath51 , and convergence at large @xmath52 .",
    "we have continued and extended here the full mass range analysis of the scalar and spinor qed effective actions for the @xmath0 symmetric backgrounds , started in @xcite , by a more detailed numerical study of both the small and large mass behaviors . in @xcite only the unphysically renormalized versions @xmath53 of these effective actions were considered ( corresponding to @xmath54 ) , which are appropriate for the small mass limit , but have a logarithmic divergence in @xmath11 in the large @xmath11 limit . here",
    "we have instead used the physically renormalized effective actions @xmath55 for the study of the large mass expansions , which made it possible to achieve a numerical matching of both this leading and even the subleading term in the inverse mass expansions of the effective actions . in our study of the small mass limit",
    ", we have improved on @xcite by obtaining good numerical results for @xmath53 even at @xmath56 , and showing continuity for @xmath57 for various values of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , we have presented numerical evidence that @xmath58 stays finite even in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "this fact is important in the spinor case , where it supports indirectly fry s conjecture @xcite that , for the case at hand , the only source of a divergence of @xmath53 for @xmath60 at @xmath57 should be the chiral anomaly term .",
    "as a side result , we have proved the finiteness of the massless limit four - point contribution to the effective action in scalar and spinor qed for the standard @xmath0 symmetric background ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "+ more details and results for the spinor qed case will be given in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
