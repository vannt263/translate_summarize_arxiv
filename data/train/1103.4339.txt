    "the pioneering work @xcite gave rise to a new class of mathematical models of plants , based on the methods of optimal control theory in which it is assumed that a plant can control itself to maximize its fitness to environment which is often identified with the mass of seeds produced by a plant during its life .",
    "the first models have been devoted to the development of annual plants . in them",
    "it is assumed that a plant consists of a number of compartments , at least of vegetative compartment ( leaves , roots , stems ) and reproductive compartment ( seeds and auxiliary tissues ) , but also can include storage and defensive tissues .",
    "the basic model of this type @xcite results in a bang - bang transition from the allocation to vegetative tissues to the allocation to seeds .",
    "this model of an annual plant has been extended in many directions : in particular in @xcite a model with multiple vegetative compartments has been analyzed , in works @xcite , @xcite a model with additional physiological constraints has been considered that results in periods of mixed growth ( where both vegetative and reproductive parts of a plant grow simultaneously ) .",
    "the optimal allocation strategies in stochastic environments have been investigated in particular in @xcite .",
    "allocation to defensive tissues was encountered , to cite a few , in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the overview of the early works in this field is provided in a paper @xcite . for general overview of the resource allocation in plants",
    "see books @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast to annual plants , to the modeling of optimal phenology of perennials less attention was devoted .",
    "usually behavior of perennials is modeled in the following way @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : the life - time of a perennial plant is divided into discrete seasons , which environmental conditions are favorable to the photosynthesis .",
    "the model of a plant in every season is continuous and is treated with the methods used in annual plant models . to model the behavior of a plant between seasons ( when the weather is unfavorable )",
    "some simple transition rules are used that show which parts of compartments are saved during the season and which are not .    the solution of such problems is divided into two parts : firstly the model on one season is solved using pontryagin s maximum principle ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and then one seeks a solution of the whole model using dynamic programming method .",
    "although these models provide quite interesting qualitative results of behavior of perennial plants , they have an important disadvantage : a subtle qualitative behavior of a plant within the season contrasts to the simple jump from the end of one season to the beginning of the next one .    in this paper",
    "we are going to propose a continuous - time model of a perennial plant .",
    "this allows us to describe more precisely the dynamics of a plant during seasons with unfavorable for photosynthesis environmental conditions and to avoid the introduction of additional parameters for description of jumps between seasons .    in particular one of predictions of the model",
    "is that the plant begins to generate the vegetative tissues not at the time , when the environment conditions are favorable for photosynthesis , but some time before , so as to come into the suitable period with developed vegetative tissues .    in the second part of the paper we investigate a trade - off between size and number of seeds .",
    "a lot of attention is devoted to this topic in the scientific literature .",
    "the basic model has been proposed in a seminal work @xcite , where it was assumed that the fitness of the plant is equal to the sum of the fitnesses of the descendants .",
    "since that this model has been generalized in many directions ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this framework",
    "the optimal size is sought depending on the properties of the fitness function .",
    "this makes possible quite general treatment of size - number trade - offs , but the question remains , how to formalize the dependency of the fitness on size and number of seeds and how to find the properties of the function , that characterizes this dependency .",
    "our aim is to investigate the trade - offs between number and size of a seed in the context of the optimal allocation models . within this framework",
    "the fitness is properly formalized , and we can investigate the the optimal size of a seed depending on the properties of photosynthetic rate function , and other physiological parameters of a plant that are more distinct criteria than the abstract fitness .",
    "we provide the analysis for the model developed in section [ hauptmodell ] of this paper , but the results are valid also for a number of other optimal allocation models .",
    "we prove that , according to our model of a plant , if the photosynthetic rate function is concave ( that is , if rate of photosynthesis per unit mass decays with increase of a size of a plant ) , then the seeds have to be as small as possible .",
    "this behavior is usual in particular for the colonizing species ( see section [ besprechung ] ) .",
    "our model includes also the possibility of choosing of a sprouting time by a seed . as a consequence",
    "we obtain the results , concerning qualitative behavior of a plant from the dormancy up to senile stage .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows : in section [ s : description ] we introduce the model of a perennial plant . in section [ s : analysis ] we provide its analysis , using pontryagin s maximum principle",
    ". then , in section [ s : results ] we summarize the results of the model , provide a general scheme of plant development and consider some special cases ( annual and monocarpic plants ) .",
    "in section [ section_samenmass ] we consider a trade - off between size and number of seeds .",
    "the results of the paper are discussed in the section [ besprechung ] .",
    "section [ schluss ] concludes the paper .",
    "usually it is assumed that all the allocated photosynthate is immediately used for construction of the tissues . in the models , taking into account a presence of a storage compartment , a plant can also allocate the resources from the storage with some maximal rate ( depending on the mass of the storage ) .",
    "such a method ignores that a photosynthate is not immediately allocated to certain structures , but exists for some time in the free state .",
    "we are going to take this effect into account and assume that there exists an intermediate stage , when the carbohydrates have already been photosynthesized , but have not already been permanently allocated to a given structure .",
    "let a plant consist of three parts : vegetative compartment , reproductive compartment and nonstructural carbohydrates ( free glucose , starch etc . ) .",
    "let + @xmath0 be the mass of vegetative compartment at time @xmath1 , + @xmath2 be the mass of reproductive compartment at time @xmath1 , + @xmath3 be the mass of nonstructural carbohydrates at time @xmath1 .",
    "we model dynamics of a plant by the following equations : @xmath4    here @xmath5 shows the rate of photosynthesis of the plant with the vegetative mass @xmath6 in the optimal environmental conditions , and @xmath7 - the maximal rate of allocation of nonstructural carbohydrates .",

    "for example , if the climate conditions are chosen to be unfavorable for photosynthesis throughout all the time - interval @xmath132 $ ] , then the model is inapplicable , because the strategy to stay in dormancy all the period is not allowed in the model .",
    "to exclude such biologically irrelevant behavior , we consider in the next subsection the case , when the first period after sprouting is vegetative period .      in this section",
    "we conclude our investigations .",
    "the development of the plant according to the model consists of 3 main periods that can be further subdivided into subperiods and that can follow each other as depicted in the figure [ fig : diagplantsbig ] .",

    "annual plant with multiple reproduction periods : see figure [ fig : monocarpics ] ( period 1 we identify with 1.1 for simplicity ) .",
    "multiple reproduction periods appear because of losses of vegetative mass due to external factors that are modeled by the function @xmath86 .",
    "this particular case has been analyzed in the early work @xcite .",
    "if @xmath133 , then the multiple reproductive periods for annual plants are not possible .",
    "+    2 .   monocarpic plants .",
    "transition @xmath97 @xmath134 1.2.1 is not possible , see figure [ fig : monocarpics ] .",
    "sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for a plant to be monocarpic is negligibility of @xmath135 ( in particular , if @xmath107 ) , in other words , the mass of storage can not decrease due to the external factors .",
    "in the previous sections we have defined fitness of a plant as a mass of reproductive tissues produced by the plant during its life . to maximize the fitness , a plant controls the allocation of photosynthate .    however , it is well - known , that the fitness depends ( for plants that propagate themselves with the help of the seeds ) crucially on the quantity ( and size ) of seeds , that a plant produces .",
    "current models of optimal allocation do not provide this information , and a mass of a seed is treated as an external parameter .",
    "in this section we consider the model of optimal allocation developed in previous sections and consider the optimal seed size problem for it .",
    "let @xmath136 be the total mass of the seeds ( the vector consisting of the masses of three components of a plant ) that has to be divided between @xmath137 seeds , @xmath138 and @xmath137 can be either natural or real number .",
    "we assume that mass of each seed is @xmath139 .",
    "the equations determining dynamics of a plant are as follows @xmath140    here @xmath141 .",
    "the aim of a plant we define as maximization of the total mass of reproductive tissues produced by all direct descendants : @xmath142    in contrast to the problem ( [ freifotmodell ] ) , ( [ ziel ] ) with the fixed mass of the seed , the problem ( [ optsamenmassemodell]),([pflzieloptmasse ] ) may have no solution ( optimality might be achieved for @xmath143 ) , that is , no admissible controls @xmath26 , @xmath27 and parameter @xmath137 generate the optimal value of @xmath144 .",
    "recall that a function @xmath8 is called concave on the set @xmath145 , if @xmath146 , @xmath147 $ ] it holds inequality @xmath148 if the inequality holds with @xmath149 instead of @xmath150 , then the function @xmath8 is called convex on the set @xmath145 .    important is the case , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are concave functions , that is , the rate of photosynthesis and maximal speed of chemical reactions in a plant are saturated with the growth of the mass of a plant ( due to self - shading of leaves , nutrient depletion in the soil etc . ) .",
    "we have the following result :    [ optsamenmasse_modernisiertesproblem ] let @xmath151 be concave , @xmath10 , @xmath138",
    ". then @xmath152 increases , when @xmath137 increases ( @xmath153 is a solution of a problem ( [ optsamenmassemodell]),([pflzieloptmasse ] ) ) .    the problem ( [ optsamenmassemodell]),([pflzieloptmasse ] ) can be written in equivalent form , using new variables @xmath154 , @xmath37 .",
    "then we have : @xmath155    the corresponding maximum problem is : @xmath156    now the problem is similar to , , but with @xmath157 and @xmath158 instead of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .    using concavity we have : @xmath159 .",
    "thus , for every @xmath160 , @xmath161 it holds @xmath162 and therefore @xmath163 and @xmath164 are nondecreasing in @xmath137 and @xmath165 and @xmath166 yields , when @xmath143 .",
    "define the value of @xmath167 for a given @xmath137 as @xmath168 .",
    "now take arbitrary @xmath169 and consider a system @xmath170    the solution of this system subject to optimality condition we denote @xmath171 .",
    "if @xmath172 , then from @xmath173 we have that @xmath174 and therefore there exists @xmath175 .",
    "hence @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 are optimal controls for a system .",
    "there exist controls @xmath179 , @xmath180 for a system , such that @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "consequently , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "constructing @xmath186 for all @xmath187 $ ] , we obtain that @xmath188 and thus the optimal trajectory of a system produces no less seeds than the best trajectory of .",
    "analogously , the output of the following system is not less than that of the system : @xmath189    hence @xmath168 is nondecreasing in @xmath137 .",
    "it follows from the previous proposition that in the case , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are concave the best strategy for a plant is to produce as much seeds as possible .    similar argument shows that for convex functions @xmath8 , @xmath9 the optimal mass of the seed has to be as large as possible ( without additional restrictions on quantity of seeds @xmath190 ) .    assuming that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are concave and continuously differentiable in the neighborhood of @xmath191 one can investigate @xmath192 using formulas @xmath193 the solution of the obtained linearized problem ( with corresponding optimality condition ) provides the `` theoretical '' upper bound for the fitness of the plant under consideration .    note that if both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are linear , then from ( [ optsamenmassemodell_neuform ] ) it follows that the yield of a plant does not depend on the mass of the seeds .",
    "the results of this section can be analogously stated also for many other optimal allocation problems .",
    "in particular they hold for the model @xmath194 with optimality condition @xmath195    here @xmath0 and @xmath2 are the masses of vegetative and reproductive tissues at time @xmath1 respectively and @xmath8 is a monotonically increasing function .",
    "we see that the optimal size of a seed depends crucially on the form of the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for concave functions that are often used to take into account the self - shading , boundedness of resources etc .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) we have proved that according to our model seeds have to be as small as possible .    for the plants living in open environments and for species occupying early phases in succession ( colonizing species )",
    "the assumption of concavity is not an oversimplification .",
    "the behavior that our model predicts , namely that the optimal strategy is to produce a vast amount of small seeds is usual for these species @xcite .",
    "however , in the closed and shady environments , under mineral shortage , or if there is a strong competition with the established vegetation , the rate of photosynthesis per unit mass can increase with the increasing of a mass of a plant , that is , the function @xmath8 is convex on some @xmath196 $ ] , @xmath197 and the seeds can not be too small .",
    "these predictions are , in general , in accordance with experiments @xcite , @xcite , but see @xcite .    note that similar optimal allocation models can be used also to study life - strategies of the animals , see @xcite . in this case",
    "it is worth mentioning that there exist species , for which the used in section [ section_samenmass ] definition of fitness ( the fitness of a parent is equal to the sum of the fitnesses of all descendants ) is not realistic .",
    "for example , in recent paper @xcite the experimental studies on keelback snakes ( tropidonophis mairii , colubridae ) were provided according to which an increase in clutch size increases the offspring size due to the fact that the uptake of water by the snake egg depends upon the number of adjacent eggs . for this case",
    "another models have to be constructed and analyzed .",
    "in the present paper we have developed the model that describes the optimal allocation strategies of a perennial ( as well as annual ) plant during all the stages of its life .",
    "the model was analyzed with the help of pontryagin s maximum principle , and as a consequence the division of a life of perennial plant ( figure [ fig : diagplantsbig ] ) was obtained .",
    "the models of monocarpic perennial plant as well as the classic models of annual plant with one or several reproduction periods have been obtained as a special case of the general model .    in the second part of the paper we analyzed the trade - off between size and number of seeds for the optimal allocation problems .",
    "we have provided the sufficient conditions that ensure that an optimal strategy is to produce as much ( or as less ) seeds as possible .",
