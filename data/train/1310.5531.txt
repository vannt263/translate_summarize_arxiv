    "modern means of transportation , civil aviation traffic in particular , effect extremely rapid global spreading of diseases @xcite , contrasting the much slower spreading dynamics by traveling fronts , for instance , during the black death in europe @xcite .",
    "concurrently , new infectious diseases keep emerging constantly , driven by human or ecologic reasons @xcite , while disease - causing microorganisms are developing various forms of multiple drug resistance @xcite .",
    "this development puts considerable strain on modern health care systems , requiring rapid , reliable , and specific diagnosis of infectious agents .",
    "there exist a number of modern techniques to detect viral and bacterial pathogens .",
    "however , most of these methods require considerable time and resources .",
    "thus , for the detection of bacteria typical techniques include the polymerase chain reaction and bacterial culture tests @xcite . for viruses , on which we focus in this work , the detection methods include electrochemical @xcite , optical @xcite , surface plasmon resonance @xcite , and biosensor devices @xcite .",
    "some of them reveal a high single - virus sensitivity and high selectivity to the virus type .",
    "several successful examples of viral detection by bioanalytical chemistry setups have indeed been reported .",
    "one of them is the macroscopic swelling of a polymeric acrylamide hydrogel , that is cross - linked by specially designed and folded ssdna molecules , upon specific binding of influenza viruses @xcite . as demonstrated in that experiment , upon binding of a specific h5n1 influenza strain to the aptamer - containing hydrogel , which coats the surface of a quartz crystal microbalance biosensor , the linkages of dna aptamers incorporated in the hydrogel become disrupted and the entire gel structure swells measurably . this highly specific and sensitive detection method for aptamer - based sensors",
    "has a number of advantages , as compared to the viral antibody - coated sensors , which are widely implemented for rapid detection of viruses , see , for instance , the assessment in ref .",
    "biosensor setups implementing surface plasmon resonance platforms based on antibody - antigen interactions were also shown to be efficient for a selective detection of various influenza , hepatitis b , and hiv viruses @xcite .",
    "surface plasmon resonance detection of avian influenza strains with a selectively - binding dna aptamer immobilized directly on the sensor surface was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , combined with the a dot blot assay for a visual detection of viruses in tracheal swab samples .    applications for use in local health care centers or even as mobile diagnostic tools require the miniaturization of the detection device , should provide a real - time signal without a prior amplification step , be easy to use , guarantee reproducible signals  and be relatively inexpensive .",
    "physical instead of biochemical and biological techniques may indeed lead the way towards novel diagnosis methods . thus , a relatively inexpensive and compact atomic force microscope setup to quickly and relatively cheaply test for bacteria and their response to drugs was recently proposed @xcite .",
    "could we come up with a method to detect viruses via a physical signal , for instance , a mechanical contraction of a matrix such as a responsive polyelectrolyte hydrogel , simply based on molecular interaction of the matrix with the surface of the virus shell ?",
    "in what follows , from extensive computer simulations and statistical mechanical calculations we demonstrate that viruses may cause a partial melting of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) molecules due to the binding affinity of the viral shell for single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) , see the illustration in fig .",
    "this partial melting of the double - helix leads to an overall contractile , entropic force between the two extremities of the linear dna chain of the order of several pn .",
    "our results demonstrate that the reaction of viruses with dna chains embedded in a hydrogel indeed leads to a significant , detectable contraction of the hydrogel .",
    "we therefore promote such dna based technology for the rapid and inexpensive detection of viruses .    in our analysis",
    "we show that there exists a sharp phase transition of the underlying dna melting , as function of the binding affinity of ssdna to the surface of the virus .",
    "we establish a phase diagram for the denaturation and reveal a scaling relation for the fraction of intact base - pairs as function of the ssdna - virus binding affinity .",
    "finally we obtain the contractile force per virus - dna pair as function of the binding affinity .",
    "upscaling of these results leads us to our central finding of the effective contraction of a hydrogel equipped with a bundle of dna chains arranged in parallel in the presence of viruses .",
    "in the established thermodynamic models of dna melting an alternating sequence of double - helical and denatured segments of different length form a partially molten dna @xcite .",
    "once a denaturation bubble is nucleated after overcoming a free energy barrier @xmath0 associated with the cooperativity parameter @xmath1 , base - pairs unzip ( and zip close again ) sequentially .",
    "dsdna can be stabilized by some dna binding cations ( protamine , alkaline earth cations ) and large ligands @xcite , cationic lipids and surfactants , crowding agents such as ficoll-70 @xcite , basic poly - peptides , and dna - binding proteins ( histones ) , as well as dna - dna attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "conversely , dsdna is destabilized by dna unwinding proteins ( gene 32 protein ) @xcite , external dna twist and super - coiling @xcite , and stretching @xcite , as well as by single - strand dna binding proteins and intercalators @xcite .",
    "the generation of an entropic force upon melting of pre - stretched , linear dna fibers was demonstrated previously .",
    "thus , for highly oriented dense dna fibers , pre - stretched by piconewton forces , the thermally or chemically induced melting transition of double - helical dna was shown to trigger macroscopic changes of the fiber length .",
    "this melting - induced fiber contraction can reach up to 70 - 90% in such mechano - chemical studies , solely due to the entropically favored shrinking of the molten segments @xcite : the highly flexible ssdna segments have a much smaller equilibrium end - to - end distance compared to the much stiffer dsdna fragments @xcite .",
    "depending on the exact conditions of the solution ( salt concentration , temperature , etc . ) and the degree of torsional freedom , dna entropic forces can indeed reach 10 to 40 pn per single dna molecule in the fiber .",
    "how do viruses come into play ?",
    "the electrical charge of viruses was already studied in the 1920ies @xcite .",
    "today we know that the external surface of the viral capsid , the protein - based shell of viruses , for a number of virus species features strongly non - uniform distributions of electric charges @xcite .",
    "dna binding to such shells can thus be based purely on electrostatic interactions .",
    "for instance , upon infection by an influenza virus , highly cationic haemo - glutinin ha glycoproteins domains , that form protrusions on the viral surface , anchor to negatively charged sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface @xcite .",
    "a number of modern anti - flu drugs impede the viral infection proliferation via preventing these electrostatic contacts from forming .    in such a scenario , the dna - virus binding affinity ,",
    "the elastic parameters of dna , and the energy difference between the molten and double - helical states of dna are all delicately sensitive to the salt concentration and temperature of the ambient solution .",
    "for instance , in the range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 molar of monovalent salt the dna melting temperature @xmath4 exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the salt molarity of the solution @xcite , leveling off at very large salinities @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic repulsion of interwound ssdna strands becomes more pronounced at lower salt , thus effectively reducing @xmath4 .",
    "the effects of electrostatic interactions onto the thermodynamics of the dna melting transition near a charged interface were analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    without external forces ,",
    "the electrostatically driven adsorption - desorption transition of unconstrained polyelectrolyte chains such as dna onto oppositely charged curved surfaces has been examined in detail theoretically @xcite and by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the scaling laws for the critical adsorption transition were obtained experimentally as functions of polyelectrolyte chain - surface adhesion strength , salt conditions , surface curvature , and chain stiffness @xcite .",
    "to tackle such a transition for patchy curved surfaces and adsorbing polymers , as considered here numerically , remains a challenge .",
    "apart from these solution - sensitive , direct electrostatic attractions between dna and the surface of the virus , there exists an alternative method to effect binding between ssdna and the virus capsid .",
    "namely , functionalized , chemically engineered viral shells can bind both dsdna and ssdna with different propensity via chemical linkers .",
    "for instance , ssdna can bind better to viral shells covered with ssdna - binding proteins , as used by viruses to dock to their host cells @xcite .",
    "thus , by various chemical and biochemical methods , the binding of ssdna to virus shells may be effected experimentally . using biochemical linkers , the ssdna binding",
    "may indeed be rendered specific to certain virus types such as influenza , norovirus , hiv , or herpes .",
    "at the same time the binding affinity may reach relatively high values such that the bonds will not dissociate over fairly long timescales .",
    "the presence of viruses can thus favor the ( partial ) melting of dna chain .",
    "how can we combine the dna - virus system with a hydrogel matrix ?",
    "hydrogels @xcite are extensively used in both industrial and medical applications , for instance , for tissue engineering purposes .",
    "these cross - linked polymeric materials feature a highly responsive behavior to various external stimuli such as temperature @xcite , solvent quality , ph as well as for detection of various substances @xcite .",
    "the volumetric changes of up to 100 times in some hydrogels are reported @xcite due to electro - osmotic swelling in low - salt solutions ( cation accumulation ) .",
    "viscoelastic hydrogels such as agarose feature a number of rubbery characteristics @xcite .    .",
    "[ fig1a],width=302 ]    we assume that in the hydrogel individual dna chains are supported in a pre - stressed , almost linear configuration , and that they are aligned in parallel , as sketched in fig .  [ fig1a ] .",
    "perpendicular to their longitudinal axis , the dna chains occupy a square or hexagonal lattice .",
    "we further assume that after adding viruses to the solution , each square or triangular `` elementary cell '' contains a virus particle .",
    "thus , on average each virus is associated with one to two dna double - helices , or two to three ssdna strands after partial denaturation of the dna chain , compare fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . given the realistic parameters we use in our quantitative analysis below , this means that each ssdna strand has sufficient accessible area to bind to the surface of the virus capsids , without significant overlap with competing ssdna segments . in what follows",
    "we consider the interaction of a single dsdna strand with a given virus capsid .",
    "due to the approximate independence of ssdna binding to the virus capsids in all cells , we will then be able to upscale our results for the entire dna bundle - virus assembly in the hydrogel . in this approach the position of the virus",
    "is fixed , reflecting the symmetry of the dna - capsid configuration .",
    "we find that viral particles in the hydrogel - dna system destabilize dsdna and effect a macroscopic contraction of the hydrogel matrix .",
    "as shown in our model configuration in fig .  [ fig1 ] the surface of the virus is the distance @xmath5 away from the axis connecting the two end - points of the dna that are fixed in the hydrogel .",
    "the separation between the axis of the dna molecule from the center of the virus is thus given by @xmath6 , where , for simplicity , the virus capsid is taken to be spherical with radius @xmath7 , and that it is centered with respect to the longitudinal mid - point of the dna chain between its two extremities incorporated in the hydrogel ( fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) . in our dna - virus pair , due to the binding affinity of ssdna to the capsid",
    "the part of the double - helix close to the virus capsid will melt ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the entire dna molecule is thus composed of two dsdna segments and two ssdna segments resulting from the molten middle part .    for now we concentrate on one of these ssdna segments ,",
    "whose length @xmath8 , in turn , is made up of the portion @xmath9 bound to the viral shell and the two vicinal , unbound ssdna fragments of length @xmath10 each of which connects the bound portion with the two intact dsdnas .",
    "once such a configuration is established , the resulting entropic strain will be transferred to the end - points of the dna chain .",
    "since the base - pair to base - pair distance is approximately 0.34 nm in dsdna , and the phosphate - phosphate distance 0.7 nm in ssdna , the maximal ssdna length available for binding to the virus is approximately two times the length of the corresponding dsdna , provided that the dsdna fragments can untwist freely upon melting which may be achieved by the specific anchoring in the hydrogel or by adding a nick close to the extremities of the dna chain .    in our simulations ,",
    "already denatured ssdna chains are equilibrated and their most probable configurations are analyzed .",
    "we distribute positive electric charges on the capsid such that they occupy an area fraction @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction free energy @xmath12 with the virus capsid due to electrostatic binding between the dna chain and the positively charged sites on the capsid as well as the resulting contraction force @xmath13 acting on the chain ends is computed , for different virus radii @xmath7 , dna separations @xmath5 from the virus surface , and ssdna - virus attraction strengths @xmath14 .",
    "this attraction strength is measured for one monomer of the ssdna chain that corresponds to a sphere of diameter @xmath15 accommodating @xmath16 base - pairs of the dsdna or 6 unpaired bases of the ssdna .",
    "the dna melting transition necessary for ssdna formation , triggered by the free energy gain from binding to the viral surface , is analyzed below as a function of these parameters .",
    "the relaxation time to reach the equilibrium increases with the length of the simulated ssdna and for decreasing ssdna - virus attraction strength . for an ssdna chain consisting of @xmath17 monomers",
    "the equilibration takes typically @xmath18 simulation steps , corresponding to approximately 10 min on a 3 ghz workstation . for polymer chains of 201 and 401 monomers , the equilibration time takes @xmath19 and @xmath20 simulation steps",
    "every point in the figures below is calculated as an average over at least @xmath21 polymer configurations , after equilibration of the system .",
    "it is natural to expect that for large dna - virus capsid binding strengths the thermal fluctuations of both the ssdna and dsdna chain domains become suppressed .",
    "they are effectively pulled out by the binding - mediated force , @xmath22 , directed towards the viral particle . for different virus dimensions and dna - virus separations ,",
    "this force contains a geometric correction factor @xmath23 and turns out to follow the simple law @xmath24 see below for details .",
    "appendix [ appa ] contains further information on the model potentials used in the simulations that act between the chain monomers as well as between the polymer chain and the virus surface .",
    "the total free energy of a partially molten dna double helix is comprised of the sum of entropic and energetic contributions along the equilibrated chain , the interaction energy of the polymer chain with the virus surface @xmath25 , and the dna melting free energy @xmath26 .",
    "the dna - virus attraction energy scales with the length of bound ssdna @xmath27 the constant @xmath28 accounts for multiple contacts that the chain monomers can establish with the attractive sphere monomers , where @xmath11 quantifies the surface fraction of attractive binding spots on the virus , see below .",
    "the dna melting free energy consists of the free energy cost for base - pair unstacking , @xmath29 , and the initiation free energy @xmath0 for nucleation of a denaturation bubble , @xmath30 for simplicity , all the dna - related energies are assumed to be independent of the dna base - pair sequence , its gc content @xcite , and , most crucially , the length of the ssdna fragments . in the simulations presented below we use @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the relatively small @xmath29 values mimic a system away from equilibrium , where the values of @xmath33 are typically used .",
    "the denaturation equilibrium of dsdna and the fluctuation spectrum of ssdna become altered by the ssdna binding to the viral capsid .",
    "the optimal length of the molten dna @xmath34 is determined self - consistently from the minimum of the total free energy functional . as order parameter for the dna adsorption transition we use the fraction of dna base - pairs adsorbed to the viral shell , @xmath35 the position of the phase transition boundary crucially depends on the strength of the dna - virus attraction , the dna density in the bundle , scaling as @xmath36 $ ] , and the virus dimensions , @xmath7 .",
    "it will be instructive to account for the maximal fraction of ssdna , @xmath37 , to be adsorbed due to geometrical constraints of the system , see below . in this state , the flanking ssdna fragments are fully stretched ( strong adsorption limit ) .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is a function of the virus size and the dna - capsid separation .",
    "we implement the ( standard ) dynamical criterion for adsorption of a ssdna chain monomer to the virus .",
    "when a monomer stays in contact with the surface for more than 50% of the simulation time , it is considered adsorbed .",
    "we assume that a portion @xmath38 of the spherical virus surface , composed of monomeric patches as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is attractive to ssdna . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a typical configuration of the virus surface with adsorbed dna .",
    "generally , attractive monomers may form a single attractive patch or be distributed randomly on the surface , as implemented below .",
    "another possibility is to form a structure of interconnected ridges mimicking a non - uniform distribution of attractive capsid proteins on the virus surface .",
    "note that for partially attractive surfaces , the ssdna monomers proximal to both attractive and neutral capsid monomers are equally counted adsorbed by the above criterion .",
    "the contractile force @xmath13 along the dna axis acting on the dsdna extremities connected to the hydrogel is due to both entropic ssdna fluctuations tending to coil up the chain and ( partial ) adsorption to the virus capsid . to find @xmath13 for a fixed length @xmath39 of ssdna and for different overall dna end - to - end distance @xmath40 , we compute the binding energy @xmath41 using the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is a particular implementation of the umbrella sampling method .",
    "then , we evaluate the force as @xmath42=k_y\\delta l.\\ ] ] here the elastic constant @xmath43 for the displacement @xmath44 of the dna ends varies in the range @xmath45 for different dna densities and for the young modulus of a hydrogel , @xmath46 .",

    ", we compute the cross - section area per dna in our cell model as @xmath49 .",
    "then , the microscopic contraction of one dna in the cell via the young modulus can be related to the relative contraction of the entire material via @xmath50 this contraction is triggered by ssdna adsorption to the virus surface and represents the macroscopically measured quantity .",
    "we now present the results of our extensive molecular dynamics computer simulations . to that end",
    "we first obtain the statistical behavior for the dna - virus interaction for a fixed length of the available ssdna fragment , before determining the optimal ssdna length self - consistently .",
    "we note that the relatively high initiation barrier @xmath0 for dna bubble formation prohibits the creation of short molten stretches of ssdna . only longer",

    "[ fig - theta ] the transition of @xmath58 appears to be of second order . for large viruses and strong ssdna - virus attraction ,",

    "the fraction @xmath55 saturates to the geometry - dependent value @xmath59 .",
    "we observe that smaller viral particles naturally require larger attraction strength for the onset of the denaturation adsorption and yield smaller fractions of bound ssdna bases , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - theta ] and s1 ( supplementary material ) .",
    "interestingly , the decrease of the fraction of non - adsorbed ssdna bases with the attraction strength fulfills the scaling relation @xmath60 for sufficiently large values of @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath67 the width of this distribution is indeed very narrow .",
    "this distribution significantly broadens and its maximum shifts away from a monomeric distance from the capsid surface when @xmath68 decreases .",
    "this is an obvious tradeoff between entropic and enthalpic effects when @xmath14 is comparable to thermal energy .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether , similar to the thermal melting transition , the sharpness of the binding - induced dna melting transition increases with dna length .",

    "these dnas partially melt and thus expose single - stranded dna , that itself binds to the virus shell .",
    "this binding can , in principle , be made specific for certain types and sizes of viruses .",
    "all ingredients are fairly inexpensive to produce , and such a setup can easily be miniaturized .",
    "we believe that this setup is a good candidate for mobile use or for use at local health care centers .",
    "alternative to measuring the mechanical deformation of the hydrogel , one could also envision optical signals due to either dna melting ( similar to molecular beacon setups @xcite ) or strong local hydrogel deformation .",
    "the binding to dna located in separate domains of the hydrogel can be made specific to certain virus types by biochemically specific functionalized units on the virus .",
    "we believe that the effects determined herein may form an alternative basis for miniaturized and inexpensive viral detection under non - clinical conditions .",

    "we set the parameters to @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "the monomer size is @xmath100 nm , close to the kuhn length of a highly flexible ssdna .",
    "in contrast to dense dna fibers @xcite , here we can neglect dna - dna interactions because the intermolecular separations exceed the diameter of a typical virus , @xmath10150 - 100 nm , and the electrostatic forces between individual dna chains are well screened .",
    "performing simulations of a free chain , we checked that the effective ssdna persistence length in this model agrees well with the known estimate of @xmath1021 - 4 nm @xcite , and the chain gyration radius follows the flory @xmath103 law for an excluded - volume / self - avoiding polymer as function of the number @xmath104 of monomers .",
    "the spherical viral shell of radius @xmath7 is modeled by a densely packed assembly of lj beads of size @xmath80 .",
    "a finite fraction @xmath38 of the monomers , distributed either in a random or ordered fashion on the viral surface , is attractive for ssdna segments in their vicinity .",
    "the ssdna - virus attraction is modeled via the same spherically symmetric lj potential , @xmath105 but with a larger cutoff - distance @xmath106 to ensure the existence of an attractive potential branch at larger distances and with varying attraction strength @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath107th chain monomer is described in our molecular dynamics analysis by the langevin equation @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the monomer mass , @xmath110 the friction coefficient , @xmath111 the monomer velocity , and @xmath112 represents zero - mean gaussian noise with component - wise @xmath113-correlation , @xmath114 .",
    "the positions of the two polymer ends , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and of the virus center @xmath117 are fixed , see fig .  1 .",

    ", however , the wham method produces more reliable force estimates and it is therefore used throughout the paper .    for many hydrogels the stress - strain relations and the young modulus are obtained from analysis of elastic deformations and ball indentation @xcite .",

    "the compositions of hydrogels can include various polyelectrolyte chains in different proportions , including a double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) .",
    "some deviations from this scaling for strong adsorption are due to the fact that in this case only a small number of polymer monomers are actually in tight contract with the surface .",
