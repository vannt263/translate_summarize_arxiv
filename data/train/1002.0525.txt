    "the analysis of the dependence of the angular size of some sources with redshift was for many decades one of the most important geometric tests of cosmological models .",
    "different cosmologies predict different dependences for a given linear size and this can be compared with the data from observations .",
    "the test , first conceived by hoyle@xcite , is simple in principle but its application is not so simple because of the difficulty in finding a standard rod , a type of object with no evolution in linear size over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "it is well known that the application of the angular size ( @xmath3 ) vs. redshift ( @xmath4 ) test gives a rough dependence of @xmath5 for qsos and radio galaxies at radio wavelengths@xcite , for first ranked cluster galaxies in the optical@xcite , and for the separation of brightest galaxies in clusters @xcite or in qso - galaxy pairs of the same redshift@xcite .",
    "the deficit of large objects at high redshifts with respect to the predictions of an expanding universe is believed to be an evolutionary effect by which galaxies were smaller in the past ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or a selection effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 relationship , as predicted by a static euclidean universe , would be just a fortuitous coincidence of the superposition of the @xmath6 dependence in the expanding universe and evolutionary / selection effects .",
    "some other studies have tried to find better standard rods .",
    "ultra - compact radio sources@xcite were used to carry out an angular size test : a dependence different from @xmath5 and closer to the predictions of expanding universe models was found .",
    "the test was even used to ascertain not only whether or not the universe is expanding but also to constrain the different cosmological parameters . however",
    ", these applications are not free from selection effects@xcite and , as will be discussed in  [ .ultracom ] , interpretation of the results of these tests is not so straightforward .",
    "another proposal@xcite used the rotation speed of high redshift galaxies as a standard size indicator since there is a correlation between size and rotational velocity of galactic disks .",
    "this method was indeed applied@xcite over a sample of emission - line galaxies with @xmath7 , with the result that einstein ",
    "de sitter cosmology is excluded to within 2-@xmath8 , and that small galaxies ( with fixed rotation velocity lower than 100 km / s ) should show a strong evolution in size ( at @xmath9 a factor two smaller than at @xmath1 ) and no evolution in luminosity within the concordance cosmology , while large galaxies do not evolve significantly , either in size or in luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , this method requires spectroscopy , so the sample has an upper limit of @xmath10 even with very large telescopes , and the uncertainties are so large that they can not be interpreted directly without certain assumptions concerning evolution models . in principle , looking at figures 4 and 5 of marinoni _",
    "et al._@xcite , one sees no reason to exclude a @xmath5 dependence .",
    "the aim of this paper is to repeat the angular size test for galaxies within a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath11 ) in optical  near infrared surveys ( equivalent to the optical at rest ) .",
    "data from high spatial resolution surveys available nowadays , such as those carried out with hubble telescope or fires , provide useful input for this old test of the angular size with new analyses and interpretations .",
    "recent analysis of these data@xcite has shown that the linear size of the galaxies with the same luminosity should be much lower than locally . however , this is true only if we considered the standard cosmological model as correct . in the present paper ,",
    "i will do a reanalysis of these data and consider different cosmological scenarios , which will shed further light on the degeneracy between expansion + evolution and non - expansion .",

    "since we have a wide range of luminosities and types of galaxies , there is a huge dispersion of sizes for a given redshift , with malmquist bias , but this dispersion and bias can be reduced by defining @xmath30 as the equivalent angular size if the galaxy were early - type with a given v - rest luminosity ( i take @xmath31 l@xmath32 ; however , the variation of this number does not affect any result , just the calibration in size ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average radius of a galaxy for a given luminosity and exponent ( @xmath13 ) of the srsic profile .",
    "the number @xmath13 is affected by an important uncertainty for galaxies with very small angular size ( @xmath35 ) @xcite , which produces some extra dispersion . in any case , the dispersion of @xmath36 values is moderate@xcite , and , given that @xmath37 does not contain the dispersion of luminosities , it will present a much lower dispersion than @xmath6 .",
    "certainly , @xmath37 contains the spread of @xmath3 and @xmath36 so the dispersion due to random errors in these quantities is larger for @xmath30 than for @xmath3 ; but the dispersion due to the spread of luminosities dominates , so , as said , @xmath30 will present a dispersion much lower than @xmath6 .",

    "another argument against the merger scenario of the hierarchical cdm cosmology is that galaxy formation is controlled by a single parameter@xcite .",

    "one important selection effect is derived from the fact that linear sizes depend on radio luminosities .",

    "however , if i use eq .",
    "( [ angdistst ] ) of the static universe with linear hubble law instead of eq .",

    "in such a case , figs . 1 and 2 of jackson@xcite would be transformed into a plot with a continuous increase in linear size with radio luminosity for all ranges of luminosity for all redshifts : roughly @xmath336 .",

    "ultra - compact objects could be used to carry out a right angular size test , but we can not directly compare objects of low luminosity at low redshift with objects of high luminosity at high redshift because we have no guarantee that the linear size is the same in both cases ( and it is not valid to assume a cosmological model a priori to prove that it is good a standard rod , because the method should be independent of any cosmological assumption if we want to derive from it which is the best cosmological model ) .",

    "the bluer ( at rest ) color of high redshift galaxies might be due to bias , because bluer galaxies with younger populations are brighter .",

    "any model of an expanding universe without evolution is totally unable to fit the angular size vs. @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the hypothesis that galaxies which formed earlier have much higher densities does not work because it is not observed here that the smaller galaxies are precisely those which formed earlier ; in any case , the galaxies observed today were formed mostly at redshifts not very different from the galaxies observed at higher redshifts .",
    "a very strong evolution in size would be able to get an agreement with the data but there appear caveats to justify it in terms of age variation of the population and/or mergers and/or ejection of massive outflows in the quasar feedback .",
    "an average of the necessary two to four major mergers per galaxy during its lifetime is excessive , and neither is it understood how massive elliptical galaxies may present passive evolution in this scenario or how spiral galaxies can become larger during their lifetimes . the depletion of gas in ellipticals by a qso feedback mechanism does not appear to be in agreement with the observed star formation and other facts . moreover , no evolution is observed in the rotation / dispersion velocities and , the fuv surface brightness turns out to be prohibitively high in some galaxies at high redshift . * static euclidean models with a linear hubble law or",
    "simple tired light fit the shape of the angular size vs. @xmath4 dependence very well : there is a difference in amplitude of 2030% , which is within the possible systematic errors .",
    "an extra small intergalactic extinction may also explain this difference of 2030%",
    ". some weak evolution of very high redshift sources is allowed , although non - evolution is a possible solution too . for the plasma redshift tired light static model ,",
    "a strong ( albeit weaker than in expanding models ) evolution in galaxy size is necessary to fit the data .",
    "the sne ia hubble diagram can also be explained in terms of these models . *",
    "it is also remarkable that the explanation of test results with an expanding universe requires four coincidences : 1 .",
    "the combination of expansion and ( very strong ) size evolution gives nearly the same result as a static euclidean universe with a linear hubble law alone : @xmath5 .",
    "this hypothetical evolution in size for galaxies is the same in normal galaxies as in qsos , as in radio galaxies , as in first ranked cluster galaxies , as the separation among bright galaxies in clusters .",
    "everything evolves in the same way to produce approximately a dependence @xmath5 .",
    "the concordance model gives approximately the same ( differences of less than 0.2 mag within @xmath371 ) distance modulus in a hubble diagram as the static euclidean universe with a linear hubble law .",
    "the combination of expansion , ( very strong ) size evolution , and dark matter ratio variation gives the same result for the velocity dispersion in elliptical galaxies ( the result is that it is nearly constant with @xmath4 ) as for a simple static model with no evolution in size and no dark matter ratio variation .",
    "+ these four coincidences might make us think that possibly we should apply occam s razor _ `` entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem '' _ , we should use the simplest models that can reproduce the same things as a complex model with many more free parameters does .",
    "it would be an irony of fate that , after all the complex solutions pursued by cosmologists for the last century , we had to come back to simple scenarios such as a euclidean static universe without expansion .",
    "none the less , we can not at present defend any of these simple models apart from the standard one because this would require other analyses .",
    "the conclusion of this paper is just that the data on angular size vs. redshift present some conflict with the standard model , and that they are in accordance with a very simple phenomenological extrapolation of the hubble relation that might ultimately be linked to a static model of the universe .",
