    "among active galactic nuclei , blazars are characterized by a high and variable degree of polarization and a flux variability often occurring on very short time scales .",
    "the observed continuum is dominated by nonthermal emission , where the emission deriving from synchrotron and self - compton is enhanced by relativistic beaming ( blandford & rees 1978 ) . some blazars exhibit",
    "not only intensity variation extending from radio waves to gamma rays , but also spectral variation as a function of the flux level in many frequency bands .",
    "an interpretation of the spectral variations can be envisaged in an inhomogeneous jet scenario of the kind proposed by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and celotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . in this model",
    "the structure of the jet is considered , the magnetic field and the relativistic electron density are assumed to decrease with distance , and the maximum synchrotron frequency is assumed to decrease with distance , accounting for a variability time shorter at larger synchrotron frequencies .",
    "the predicted variability pattern is caused by a disturbance ( e.g. shock ) traveling down the jet .",
    "this perturbation is assumed to produce only a fixed enhancement in magnetic field and particle density and to unchange the shape of the electron distribution .",
    "the overall spectrum is the superposition of the located spectra emitted by each slice of the jet . as it has been applied to bl lac objects",
    ", the model does not consider the evolution of the relativistic electron distribution affected by radiation losses , new injection of relativistic electrons and shock waves .",
    "however , simultaneous observations of blazars over a wide spectral range suggest that significant radiation losses and injection of relativistic electrons occur in flares . for example",
    ", the variability of pks2155 - 304 at x - ray , euv and uv bands is decreased in amplitude and with significant delays approximately satisfying a @xmath0 relation ( urry et al .",
    "in particular , the radiation loss time for electrons that emit optical and x - ray emission in blazars is probably far less than the light ( or the shock ) crossing time of the emitting region .",
    "consequently , if the electron distributions responsible for high energy emission are kept by the shock acceleration processes , then radiation losses and the injection of electrons occur in the vicinity of the shock during the flare and must be considered in the theory .",
    "many models to reproduce the spectral variability have been developed ( mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ; georganopoulous & marscher 1998 ; kirk , rieger & mastichiadis 1998 ; wang et al .",
    "1999 ; ghiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ; li & kusunose 2000 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum and time delays between the light curves at fluxes at different frequencies are believed to be produced by the electron distribution at different stages of evolution after episodic electron injection phases .",
    "however these models can not account for a synchrotron peak drifting to higher energies at x - ray wavelengths during the rising phase of the flare in mrk 421 ( fossati et al .",
    "the above hard lag is most likely related to the particle acceleration process .",
    "the role of particle acceleration by shock waves has been considered by kirk et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this model ,",
    "electron acceleration and radiation zones are separated .",
    "electrons are continuously accelerated at the shock front , and subsequently drift away from it in the downstream and emit most of the radiation .",
    "the emission from the acceleration zone is ignored .    through shocks",
    "can quickly accelerate particles to very high energies , this requires the existence of some scattering agent to force repeated passage of the particles across the shock .",
    "the most likely agent for scattering is plasma turbulence or plasma waves .",
    "however , the plasma turbulence needed for the scattering can not only accelerate particles stochastically ( second order fermi acceleration ) , but can cause particle diffusion in the downstream zone quickly . if the dissipation of the bulk energy of blazar jet into particles includes shocks and plasma turbulence , it seems difficult to distinguish acceleration zone and emission region .",
    "the emitting particles in downstream could be re - accelerated by shock waves under the scattering of plasma turbulence .",
    "therefore we try to consider the synchrotron emission from a single dissipation region which includes shock and turbulence processes and radiation losses .    in section",
    "ii we present a stochastic differential equation to describe a particle acceleration and cooling processes , together with the assumptions made .",
    "then we derive a diffusion - advection equation of particle energy distribution which simulates the temporal evolution of the particle radiation occurring when shock waves and plasma turbulence are produced in a dissipation region of a jet .",
    "in section iii we apply our model to mrk 421 to explain the hard lag observed in the x - ray light curves .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section iv .",
    "we focus on the particle acceleration and cooling processes and assume that pitch - angle scattering maintains an almost isotropic particle distribution .",
    "we also assume that the shock in a relativistic blazar jet is nonrelativistic , and assume that the light crossing time of the dissipation region is short compared with the intrinsic cooling and acceleration timescales .",
    "it is shown that the observed variability is determined by the intrinsic cooling and acceleration processes .",
    "we use a homogeneous model in which both the magnetic field and the particle distribution function are assumed homogeneous through the dissipation region , and consider only the synchrotron radiation of the accelerating particles , leaving the more involved computation of inverse compton emission to future work .",
    "firstly we use a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) to describe a particle acceleration and cooling processes , as has been used by some authors ( krlls & achterberg 1994 ; mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ) .",
    "then we derive a diffusion - advection equation of particle energy distribution ( or fokker - plank equation ) .",
    "because the particle distribution is assumed to be isotropic in space and momentum , we consider only the evolution of the particle energy given by    @xmath1    the energy losses @xmath2 is mainly determined by synchrotron radiation and is a deterministic process in homogeneous model .",
    "it has the form    @xmath3    the energy gains @xmath4 is due to shock wave and plasma turbulence , and is assumed to have the form    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is a stochastic variable which is determined by mean value @xmath7 and a variable @xmath8 given by the gaussian noise process , namely it defined by the value @xmath9 and the autocorrelation function @xmath10 , where the coefficient @xmath11 denotes the noise intensity which is assumed to represent the stochastic influence of plasma turbulence .",
    "this means that the turbulence will influence the rate of shock acceleration stochastically and cause the particle energy gain to be a random process .",
    "to that end one writes eq(2 ) as an sde    @xmath12    for simplify we have assumed that @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath11 change slowly compared to particle cooling and acceleration processes , and treat them as constants .    the fokker - plank equation corresponding to the system of sde given in eq(4 ) are ( stratonovich 1967 )    @xmath15 + d\\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial ^2\\varepsilon } % \\left [ \\varepsilon ^2f(\\varepsilon , t)\\right ] , \\ ] ]    where @xmath16 denotes a conditional probability density @xmath17 for any initial energy @xmath18 at @xmath19 .",
    "if the number @xmath20 of particles undergo acceleration , the evolution equation of the particle number density @xmath21 is similar to eq(5 ) . in order to include particle escape and injection , we are easy to extend the evolution equation as ( schlickeiser 1984 )    @xmath22 + d\\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial ^2\\varepsilon } \\left [ \\varepsilon ^2n(\\varepsilon , t)\\right ] -\\frac{n(\\varepsilon , t)}{t_{esc}}+q(\\varepsilon , t).\\ ] ]    we consider only the intrinsic cooling and acceleration processes and assume that the timescale of particle is longer than that of the intrinsic physical processes .",
    "we ignore the particle escape term in eq(6 ) .",
    "otherwise we assume that the particles in the dissipation region are accelerated from the initial time @xmath19 and no new particle is injected in the following time . the injection term in eq(6 )",
    "is also ignored .",
