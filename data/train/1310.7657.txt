    "lal oscillations consist of periodic motions of the prominence threads along the magnetic field that are disturbed by a small energetic event close to the filament ( see luna et al .",
    "paper in this volume ) .",
    "luna and karpen ( 2012 ) argue that prominence oscillations can be modeled as a damped oscillating pendulum , whose equation of motion satisfies a zeroth - order bessel function . in their model ,",
    "a nearby trigger event causes quasi - stationary preexisting prominence threads sitting in the dips of the magnetic structure to oscillate back and forth , with the restoring force being the projected gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate ( e.g. luna et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ) . in this paper , we report preliminary results of comparisons of observations of prominence oscillations with the model presented by luna and karpen ( 2012 ) .",
    "more details will be available in the forthcoming paper by luna et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    in this analysis",
    ", we place slits along the filament spine and measure the intensity along each slit as a function of time . fig .",
    "[ figures ] ( left ) shows the filament in the aia 171  filter with the slits overlaid .",
    "each slit is then rotated in increments of 0.5@xmath0 from 0@xmath0 to 60@xmath0 with respect to the filament spine .",
    "we select the best slit according to the following criteria : ( a ) continuity of oscillations , ( b ) amplitude of the oscillation is maximized , ( c ) clear transition from dark to bright regions , ( d ) maximum number of cycles .",
    "[ figures ]    the oscillation for a representative slit is shown in figure [ figures ] ( right ) , which corresponds to the grey slit in figure [ figures ] ( left ) .",
    "we identify the position of the center of mass of the thread by finding the intensity minimum along the slit , indicated by black crosses in figure [ figures ] ( right ) .",
    "these points are then fit to equation ( 2.1 ) of luna et al .",
    "( this volume ) , and the resulting fit is shown in white .",
    "fitting our data to equation ( 2.1 ) of luna et al .",
    "( this volume ) yields values of @xmath1 ranging between 1 - 13 . using equation ( 2.2 ) of luna et al .",
    "( this volume ) , we find the average radius of curvature of the magnetic field dips that support the oscillating threads .",
    "we find it to be approximately 60 mm .",
    "we also calculate a threshold value for the field itself that would allow it to support the observed threads . using equation ( 3.1 ) of luna et al .",
    "( this volume ) , we find an average magnetic field of @xmath2 , assuming a typical filament number density of @xmath3 @xmath4 , in good agreement with measurements ( e.g. mackay et al .",
    "on average , the oscillations form an angle of @xmath5 with respect to the filament spine , and have a period of @xmath6 hours .",
    "to explain the very strong damping mass must accrete onto the threads at a rate of about 60 @xmath7 kg / hr .",
    "we conclude that the observed oscillations are along the magnetic field , which forms an angle of @xmath8@xmath9 with respect to the filament spine ( tandberg - hanssen & anzer , 1970 ) .",
    "we find that both the curvature and the magnitude of the magnetic field are approximately uniform on different threads .",
    "both the bessel and sinusoidal functions are well fitted , indicating that mass accretion is a likely damping mechanism of lal oscillations , and that the restoring force is the projected gravity in the dips where the threads oscillate . the mass accretion rate agrees with the theoretical value ( karpen et al . , 2006 , luna , karpen , & devore , 2012 ) ."

    "<S> on 20 august 2010 an energetic disturbance triggered damped large - amplitude longitudinal ( lal ) oscillations in almost an entire filament . in the present work we analyze this periodic motion in the filament to characterize the damping and restoring mechanism of the oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> our method involves placing slits along the axis of the filament at different angles with respect to the spine of the filament , finding the angle at which the oscillation is clearest , and fitting the resulting oscillation pattern to decaying sinusoidal and bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> these functions represent the equations of motion of a pendulum damped by mass accretion . with this method </S>",
    "<S> we determine the period and the decaying time of the oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> our preliminary results support the theory presented by luna and karpen ( 2012 ) that the restoring force of lal oscillations is solar gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate , and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads . following an earlier paper , we have determined the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic flux tubes hosting a thread along the filament , as well as the mass accretion rate of the filament threads , via the fitted parameters . </S>"
