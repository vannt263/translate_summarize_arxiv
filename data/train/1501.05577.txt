    "there is by now overwhelming evidence that black holes with masses ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( see review @xcite ) exist in the center of most galaxies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the presence of a supermassive black hole leads to a number of consequences for dynamics , whose study has been a subject of extended research in the last three decades ( indicative references closely related to our present work are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see merritt ( 1999 ) or ( 2013 ) for complete reviews of the subject . )",
    "inter alia , the growth of a central black hole provides a mechanism driving _ secular evolution _ in galaxies .",
    "the creation of secularly evolving models by the insertion of a central mass is ubiquitous in n - body simulations of non rotating elliptical galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the secular evolution causes two main effects : i ) the density profile becomes more cuspy in the center ( @xcite ) , and ii ) the galaxy becomes more spherical in the center and more axisymmetric in the outer parts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the growth of black holes in disc galaxies slowly disrupts the bars by changing the stability properties of many orbits that support the bar ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see review @xcite ) .    in the case of elliptical galaxies , a physical interpretation of why , after the insertion of a central mass , secular evolution favors particular endstates was provided in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is based on closely examining the orbital dynamics of those particles whose orbits are directly affected by the central mass .",
    "the main scenario of the secular evolution process presented in these works can be summarized as follows : at a first stage , the insertion ( or gradual turning on ) of the central mass results in a conversion of the majority of box orbits into chaotic orbits ( @xcite ) . following the evolution of the system by n - body simulations",
    ", it is found that the newly formed chaotic orbits start inducing a gradual change in the distribution of matter , i.e. , the shape of the system , which becomes more spherical given that the distribution of chaotic orbits is more isotropic .",
    "the slow change in shape , in turn , causes an adiabatic change in the potential , thus affecting the _ phase space structure _ , in particular at energies for which the phase space was initially ( before the insertion of the central mass ) occupied mainly by box orbits passing arbitrarily close to the center .",
    "the main change of the phase space structure regards the volume increase of the domain corresponding to regular short axis tube ( sat ) orbits ( see @xcite for definition ) . as the volume of the sat domain increases",
    ", some chaotic orbits are adiabatically captured inside the boundary of the sat domain ( @xcite ) .",
    "this capture then induces an additional change in the form of the system , enhancing the conversion of chaotic orbits into sat orbits , etc .",
    "this cyclic process maintains secular evolution up to a point where the population of chaotic orbits decreases substantially .",
    "the systems evolved by this mechanism are closer to oblate .",
    "furthermore , in the final stages the percentage of chaotic orbits becomes smaller even than the one in the original systems , before the insertion of the central mass .",
    "it should be noted that the degree up to which the transformation of a system from triaxial to axisymmetric proceeds depends on how many box orbits are transformed to chaotically scattered orbits due to the central mass . for example , in @xcite the initial percentage of outer box orbits is such that an adiabatic introduction of the central mass does not destroy triaxiality in the outer parts of their galaxy simulation models .",
    "also , @xcite examined how stochastic ( or ` non - reversible ' ) can the whole process of secular evolution be characterized , by considering the secular evolution of dark matter haloes in various models of central mass concentrations .",
    "while their findings re - confirm the picture of ( non - reversible ) stochastic evolution in the case of a point - like central mass concentration ( e.g. a black hole ) , they find that there is also a different , i.e. , ` regular ' ( or reversible ) type of evolution taking place in systems in which the central mass is spatially distributed ( e.g. a galactic disc or bulge embedded in a triaxial halo ) .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the mechanism of secular evolution induced by the chaotic scattering of centrophylic orbits . in order to quantify the rate of secular evolution induced by the above mechanism",
    ", @xcite introduced a novel quantity , measurable in n - body simulations , called the _ effective chaotic momentum _",
    "@xmath12 in eq.([efcm ] ) , @xmath13 is the mean value of the _ lyapunov characteristic number _ ( lcn ) of a sub - ensemble of chaotic orbits in the system after the insertion of the central mass .",
    "this is defined by the orbits belonging to a percentage window @xmath14 around the characteristic value where the distribution @xmath15 of the logarithms of the lyapunov exponents @xmath16 of all the particles in chaotic orbits presents its global maximum .",
    "considering a percentage window is necessary since , as we will see also below , the distribution @xmath15 is two - peaked , while the secular evolution is caused mainly by orbits forming the higher of the two peaks of the distribution . as a rule , these are centrophilic orbits passing arbitrarily closely to the central mass . on the other hand , @xmath17 is the total mass inside the same window , while @xmath18 is the total mass of the n - body system considered .",
    "the use of the effective chaotic momentum @xmath19 allows one to quantify several phenomena related to the rate of secular evolution .",
    "a remarkable result is that there appears to be a global ( i.e. the same in all simulations ) theshold value @xmath20 such that as a system undergoes secular evolution , with a time - varying value of @xmath21 , the evolution becomes inefficient over a hubble time when @xmath21 falls below @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "from the two factors in the definition of @xmath19 ( eq.[efcm ] ) , the percentage of chaotic orbits @xmath22 depends on the specific system studied , i.e. on the initial distribution function that determines the initial conditions of the simulation .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite and @xcite , the distribution of lyapunov exponents , and in particular the value of @xmath23 is found numerically to be not very sensitive to the choice of initial distribution function in the simulations .",
    "thus , simulations representing systems with different profiles and triaxiality were found to exhibit different percentages of chaotic orbits , but similar levels of @xmath23 , the latter found , instead , to be correlated with the _ value of the mass ratio _ of the central mass over the mass of the hosting system .",
    "hereafter , this ratio is simply referred to as the ` central mass parameter ' @xmath2 .",
    "these findings indicate that , from the two factors entering the computation of the rate of secular evolution via the ` effective chaotic momentum ' , one ( percentage @xmath22 of chaotic centrophylic orbits ) depends on the self - consistent distribution function of the system considered , while the other ( mean lyapunov exponent @xmath23 ) depends strongly only on the value of the mass parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in the present paper we focus on this latter dependence , and seek to model its dynamical origin .",
    "we note that a dependence of the mean lyapunov exponent @xmath1 of the centrophilic orbits on @xmath2 is a result derived also in studies using fixed potentials ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite , on the other hand , this dependence was explicitly determined by the orbital data of the particles in n - body simulations yielding the value of @xmath23 which is a good measure of @xmath1 . a remarkably good _ power - law dependence _",
    "was found , namely @xmath24 the proximity of @xmath3 to 0.5 was also found in models of simple galactic potentials @xcite . as shown in section 2 , somewhat smaller values , around @xmath25 , are deduced by a careful a posteriori analysis of the numerical results presented in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we first reconfirm numerically the power - law ( [ lm ] ) in further fixed - potential computations .",
    "then , we develop a theoretical modelling allowing to interpret the origin of this power - law .",
    "we also justify why the exponent @xmath3 obtains values in the observed range .",
    "in particular , our theory yields an exponent @xmath6 , where @xmath26@xmath8 .",
    "our theoretical modeling stems from considering the dynamics of chaotic centrophilic orbits which undergo ` transits ' , i.e. they spend part of their time inside and another part outside the so - called ` sphere of influence ' of the central mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "one may note here that transiting is a necessary condition for chaos , since orbits lying entirely within the sphere of influence ( i.e. the so - called ` pyramids ' ( @xcite ) ) obey three quasi - integrals of motion which are deformations of the keplerian integrals derived using perturbation theory ( here , the perturbation consists of the triaxial galactic potential , which perturbs the otherwise keplerian dynamics very close to the black hole , see @xcite ) . on reverse , as shown below , for transiting orbits one can determine the so - called _ stretching number _",
    "( i.e. local lyapunov number ) yielding the local rate of deviation of two orbits with nearby initial conditions across one transit .",
    "the lyapunov exponent , modeled as the sum of many such stretching numbers , turns then to be positive , i.e. the orbits are chaotic .",
    "we provide various types of evidence for the validity of this approximation , which allows to predict a ( positive ) mean value for the lyapunov exponent as a function of the central mass parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is remarkable , in this respect , that during a transit the motion can be characterized as nearly keplerian , while far from transits the motion is box - like and obeys three approximate integrals .",
    "thus , both ` piecewise ' motions can be analyzed by nearly - integrable approximations . nevertheless , their union yields chaos .    in our basic modeling",
    "we use a simple galactic model with a harmonic core .",
    "this ensures a priori the presence of many box orbits before the insertion of the black hole .",
    "however , it is well known that realistic galactic models present power - law central density cusps @xmath27 ( @xcite , @xcite , see review in @xcite , sect.4.3.1 ) .",
    "central cusps are characterized as ` weak ' if @xmath28 or ` strong ' if @xmath29 , with the central force tending to zero or to infinity respectively .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. @xcite ) that the central cusps are themselves an important source of chaos for centrophylic orbits .",
    "thus , they significantly affect the value of @xmath1 even without the presence of a central black hole .",
    "we will show , however , by numerical tests , that the presence of the central cusp introduces a critical mass parameter scale @xmath30 , depending on the value of @xmath31 , such that , for @xmath32 the chaotic scattering is dominated by the black hole , while for @xmath33 it is dominated by the central cusp . as shown in section 4 , we then essentially recover an effective power law @xmath0 for @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we present numerical evidence that an effective power - law of the same form applies in rotating disc - barred galaxies with central black holes . in this case , the relevant mass parameter @xmath2 corresponds to the ratio of the mass of the black hole over the total mass of the bar . in summary , although our theoretical interpretation for the origin of the effective law @xmath0 is strictly valid in a quite simplified ( and rather unrealistic ) galactic model , our numerical evidence is that such a law appears generically in models of increasing complexity ( and astrophysical interest ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 presents further numerical results about the empirical relation @xmath0 , using a simple galactic - type potential to which we add the potential of the central mass .",
    "these results are used in order to probe numerically some aspects of subsequent modeling .",
    "our theoretical modeling itself is presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents numerical results in models with central cusps and discusses the extent and limits of validity of previous results on the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in such models .",
    "section 5 deals with the @xmath0 relation in barred disc galaxy models , discussing both its applicability and origin , despite the non - existence , in such systems , of box - like orbits .",
    "section 6 summarizes the main conclusions of the present study .",
    "at first we study the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a simple hamiltonian model that captures the main features of motion near the center of an elliptical galaxy with non - singular central force field , to which we add a keplerian term corresponding to the central mass .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational potential : @xmath36 the variables @xmath37 are cartesian position coordinates , @xmath38 their conjugate momenta , and @xmath39 .",
    "the softening parameter @xmath40 was added in the keplerian potential in order to avoid large numerical errors when the orbits pass very close to the center .",
    "we selected a set of incommensurable frequencies @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 so as to avoid dealing with resonant orbits satisfying some low - order commensurability .",
    "the anharmonicity parameter @xmath44 was given values between 0.01 and 0.5 .",
    "various tests of the robustness of our results against @xmath44 are reported below .",
    "we also note that the quartic potential term was choosen so as to represent a generic form without particular symmetries , while in galaxies with one or more planes of symmetry the potential presents a corresponding even symmetry .",
    "the gravitational potential ( [ vham ] ) corresponds to a galaxy model with a harmonic core .",
    "the far more realistic case in which a central cusp is present is examined in detail in section 4 below . here",
    ", the choice of the potential ensures a priori the existence of many regular box orbits , when @xmath45 , which are transformed to chaotically scattered orbits when @xmath46 . in the model ( [ vham ] )",
    ", the force grows linearly with distance from the center , while the force from the central mass falls as an inverse square law .",
    "the two forces become similar in magnitude at distances comparable to the radius ( @xcite ) : @xmath47 the sphere @xmath48 is called sphere of influence of the central mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is of order unity in units in which the frequencies @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are of order unity ( as in eq.([ham ] ) ) .",
    "then , for the total mass of the galaxy one also has @xmath53 .",
    "the periods of orbits reaching apocentric positions @xmath54 are of order @xmath55 .",
    "the equations of motion resulting from the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) are : @xmath56 in lyapunov exponent computations we also make use of the variational equations : @xmath57 in numerical computations we solve together the equations ( [ eqmot ] ) and ( [ eqvar ] ) .",
    "we use a 7 - 8th order runge - kutta method with fixed time step @xmath58 . for a choice of softening @xmath59",
    ", this time step ensures that energy is conserved to within an error between @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all orbits .    the lyapunov characteristic number ( lcn )",
    "is defined through the relation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 . in practical computations",
    "we make use of the finite time lyapunov characteristic number : @xmath64    we made computations for ensembles of @xmath65 orbits for the mass parameter values @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , as well as the values of the anharmonicity parameter @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath5 .",
    "the initial conditions of each ensemble are choosen as follows . for each initial condition , we choose first randomly a value of the energy in the range @xmath75 , with uniform distribution .",
    "then , we produce an orbit of zero initial angular momentum , by setting @xmath76 and by solving for @xmath77 the equation @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are spherical coordinates corresponding to the cartesian point @xmath37 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 are choosen randomly with a uniform distribution in the intervals @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the selected range of energies represents motions with apocentric distances of order @xmath84 .",
    "these are all centrophilic orbits with a zero mean value of either component of the angular momentum .",

    "almost all orbits in this ensemble are chaotic , as their finite - time lyapunov exponents are stabilized to non zero values .",
    "only a small subset of orbits exhibit a value of @xmath85 that keeps falling even at the time @xmath88 , following the law @xmath96 .",

    "we also note a tendency towards smaller values for smaller @xmath113",
    ". however , the bigger values are more representative of the true exponent , since they appear at times closer to the limit when @xmath85 tends to its limiting value for chaotic orbits , i.e. the lyapunov characteristic number ( lcn ) . if @xmath114 denotes the lcn limit , it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the generic behavior of @xmath85 is to fall like @xmath115 up to a time @xmath116 .",

    ". we can observe that , along a fixed panel row ( i.e. fixed @xmath2 , integration time increasing from left to right ) , the right wing of the histogram is shifted in general to the left as @xmath113 increases .",
    "the shift is more conspicuous in the uppermost panel row ( small @xmath2 ) , in which the orbits have , in general , smaller values of the lcn , and hence , larger values of their saturation times @xmath117 . on the other hand , in the lowermost panel row ( @xmath103 , i.e. , large ) , the saturation time is small ( @xmath120 for nearly all orbits ) .",
    "hence , the histogram @xmath121 remains practically invariant beyond the time @xmath107 , as shown in the three panels of the same row .",
    "the difference in the saturation times between small and large @xmath2 has , as a consequence , that in each _ column _ of fig.[plloglm ] ( same parameters but increasing @xmath113 ) , the value of @xmath1 for all @xmath2 presents some shift downwards as @xmath113 increases .",

    "nevertheless , the tendency of @xmath3 to increase with time is only temporary , since @xmath3 is stabilized after all the orbits have reached their saturation times .",
    "this happens around @xmath88 .     versus @xmath2 relation",
    "as derived from the data of ( a ) kandrup and sideris ( 2002 ) ( lowest order approximation of a triaxial dehnen potential ) , and ( b ) merritt and valluri ( 1996 ) ( potential corresponding to a galaxy with cusp ) . in ( a ) , the compiled data confirm a power law relation @xmath122 over the whole range of values of @xmath2 considered .",

    "both lines extend to a non - zero value of @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "this represents the values corresponding to what is called ` residual chaos ' in section 4 below , i.e. , chaos induced by the central cusp itself .",
    "the best - fit exponents were computed in this case only by the three rightmost data points . ]",
    "another remark is that the dependence of the exponent @xmath3 on the anharmonicity parameter @xmath44 appears to be weak .",
    "this fact confirms that the main source of the chaotic behavior of the orbits is the scattering by the central mass , while nonlinear effects due to the quartic terms in the potential are of small importance .",
    "this agrees with findings in ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted , in this respect , that a power - law relation @xmath122 can be extracted by an a posteriori analysis of data in independent published works ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite computed finite - time lyapunov characteristic exponents in a potential representing the lowest expansion terms of a dehnen potential with a superposed softened keplerian term corresponding to the central mass . from their work ( their figure 12 ) , the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be compiled in a log - log scale . as shown in fig.[mervalkand]a ,",
    "one obtains a power law fitting with @xmath123 .",
    "similarly , @xcite computed the first and second ( finite - time ) lyapunov characteristic numbers of chaotic orbits in potentials corresponding to a galaxy with cuspy density profile and a central core radius .",
    "their results can be compared to ours in the limit where the core radius ( their parameter @xmath126 ) is larger than the sphere of influence of the central mass .",
    "this is the case @xmath127 in table 1 of @xcite , compiled in log - log scale in fig.[mervalkand]b .",

    "the best - fit exponents are @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively , while these values are only indicative due to the scarcity of data and the unknown influence of the central cusp of the potential to the result .",
    "we note , finally , that the breaking of the power law and the appearance of a non - zero value of @xmath1 as @xmath125 in fig.[mervalkand]b is due to a phenomenon called below ` residual chaos ' , i.e. chaos due to the cusp itself .",
    "this phenomenon is analyzed in section 4 .",
    "as an overall conclusion , a power - law @xmath122 appears quite commonly in numerical computations of the lyapunov exponents of the stellar orbits chaotically scattered by a central mass in various galactic models .",
    "we now proceed in a theoretical modelling allowing to interpret the origin of this power law .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a modelling of the process of chaotic scattering of the orbits by the central mass becomes feasible by considering two distinct regimes of the motion , i.e. i ) transits through the sphere of influence and ii ) out - of - transit oscillations .",
    "we begin by showing that within the out - of - transit regime the orbits obey three quasi - integrals of motion .",
    "such integrals can be written as formal series , using , for example , the ` third integral ' approach ( @xcite ) .",
    "a formal series has the form @xmath131 , where @xmath132 are polynomial terms of degree @xmath77 in the canonical variables @xmath133 .",
    "the term @xmath134 is set equal to the harmonic energy in one of the three possible degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath135 , @xmath136 , or @xmath137 .",
    "terms of higher degree are computed recursively , by solving , order by order , the equation @xmath138=0\\ ] ] where @xmath139 $ ] denotes the poisson bracket operator , and @xmath140 , @xmath141 are the quadratic and quartic terms of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "this means that the formal integrals are possible to define for the hamiltonian neglecting the influence of the central mass .",
    "then , we test numerically how well they are preserved in the full model , in the out - of - transit regime .",
    "truncated at order 4 ( thin line ) or 10 ( thick line ) for an example of box orbit with initial conditions @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",

    "the degree of approximation of these expressions can be tested by probing how well the integral values are preserved along individual orbits integrated first in the hamiltonian @xmath151 ( i.e. without the central mass ) . for orbits in the energy range",
    "considered , we find that , up to @xmath152 , all three integrals are preserved to within a time variation of about @xmath153 at the truncation order @xmath77 .",

    "n - body simulations of barred galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have demonstrated that the growth of a central mass concentration induces secular evolution in such systems as well .",
    "in fact , although dynamically not favored , black hole growth to a mass level as high as @xmath360@xmath361 , corresponding to a few percent of the mass of a typical galactic bar , could induce even a total destruction of the bar , with its conversion into a nearly axisymmetric bulge - like component .",

    "such orbits can not exist in rotating disc - barred galaxies .",
    "however , as shown in the sequel , centrophilic orbits appear around the main families of planar periodic orbits ( e.g. the @xmath9 family ) .",
    "note that the presence of some type of centrophilic orbits is an indispensible feature of bars with a rising density profile in the center . as discussed below ,",
    "albeit different in morphology , the centrophilic orbits in barred galaxies are found numerically to exhibit a similar chaotic behavior as the boxy centrophilic orbits in elliptical galaxies .",

    "the outermost librational invariant curves of these islands correspond to thick tube orbits ( fig.[orb2to14to1 ] ) .",
    "the crucial difference between the two tube orbits in figs.[orb2to14to1]a and b is that in fig.[orb2to14to1]a the tube orbit leaves a hole in the center , whose dimension is larger than the black hole s sphere of influence . on the contrary , the tube thickness of the orbit in fig.[orb2to14to1]b is larger than the half - width of the orbit s amplitude of oscilation in the y - axis , i.e. , the orbits leaves no hole in the center .",
    "then , after the insertion of the central mass , the orbit with same initial conditions as in fig.[orb2to14to1]a retains its regular ( quasi - periodic ) character ( fig.[orb2to14to1]c ) , while the orbit with same initial conditions as in fig.[orb2to14to1]c becomes chaotic ( fig.[orb2to14to1]d ) .",
    "a similar criterion applies to whether or not a thick tube orbit around the 4:1 periodic orbit becomes regular or chaotic after the insertion of the central mass ( fig.[orb2to14to1]e - h ) .",
    "in fact , one readily finds that the initial conditions separating these two types of orbits correspond to the last librational kam curve in the 4:1 island of stability of the section of fig.[poinc2to14to1]d .    .",

    "]    investigating the efficiency of the above mechanism to other resonances , one finds that the mechanism is not able to produce chaotic orbits in the cases of other low - order resonances like 3 : 1 and 6 : 1 .",
    "in fact , the tube orbits trapped around these central periodic orbits in this model form rather small islands of stability .",
    "thus , the tube thickness is small , and we find no tube orbits able to cross the central masses sphere of influence .",
    "a similar restriction holds for higher order families in the same model .",
    "in the present paper we analyze the origin of a numerically observed approximate power - law relation @xmath0 , with @xmath4090.30.5 , where @xmath1 is the mean lyapunov exponent of centrophilic orbits in galaxies with central masses ( black holes ) , and @xmath2 the mass parameter , i.e. , the ratio of the central mass over the mass of the galaxy . also , we find that such a law can be recovered in quite different contexts and models of galactic systems , ranging from elliptical galaxies with cores or cusps to rotating barred galaxies .",

    "we find how the various estimates depend on @xmath2 as well as on the orbital energy . regarding ( b ) , we find two different estimates , according to whether an orbit can be characterized as ` planar ' or ` 3d ' . putting all estimates together ,",

    "their initial conditions are close to the last librational kam curve of the islands of stability around their corresponding periodic orbits .",
    "numerically , we observe that only the tube orbits around the lowest - order periodic orbits can become centrophylic .",
