    "the nearby common proper - motion pair 16 cyg a and b ( hd186408 and hd186427 , respectively ) have been of particular interest to stellar astronomers for a number of reasons . in their physical characteristics",
    ", they are both very similar to the sun and as such have been labeled `` solar twins '' or `` solar analogs '' ( friel et al . 1993 , hereafter f93 ) . like any human twins , however",
    ", these two stars clearly can not be exactly similar to the sun or even to each other , and it is their differences that have generated the most recent interest .",
    "most notably , radial - velocity studies have revealed that 16 cyg b harbors a planetary - mass companion , while 16 cyg a apparently does not ( cochran et al .",
    "this remarkable observation has itself been invoked by some to explain other unexpected chemical differences between these two stars ( cochran et al .",
    "1997 ; king 1997 ; gonzalez 1998 , hereafter g98 )  their li abundances differ by a factor of five of more ( deliyannis et al . 2000 , hereafter d00 ) , while studies of the fe abundance of this pair have consistently suggested that 16 cyg a may be slightly more metal - rich ( @xmath20.05 dex ) than its companion ( g98 ) .",
    "how are these differences achieved in such otherwise similar stars , which share a presumably common primordial environment ?",
    "to what level can dynamic interactions with a planetary system affect abundances in a stellar photosphere ?",
    "unfortunately , with the exception of lithium , the small differences in line depths between these two stars combined with the relatively large uncertainties in abundance determinations to date have prevented any conclusive statements to be made about deviations between 16 cyg a and b with regard to any other element , including iron ( g98 ; d00 ) ; within the uncertainties , the measured chemical differences are all effectively zero .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to utilize a new differential line abundance analysis method to better constrain the relative [ fe / h ] values between 16 cyg a and b. such a method , as shown by langer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , eliminates non - trivial uncertainties in oscillator strengths , @xmath3 values .",
    "further , we utilize a more extensive fe linelist covering a wider range in lower excitation potential ( @xmath4 ) than previous published studies . in  2 , we describe our observations and the data reduction , in  3 we describe our analysis methods and present results , and we discuss their significance in  4 .",
    "our intentions from the start have been to perform a very careful spectroscopic analysis of 16 cyg a and b , optimized for differential analysis .",
    "we determined at the outset to make every effort to minimize any systematic differences which might arise due to variations in our observations , reductions , and subsequent analyses of each star . with this goal in mind",
    ", we obtained optical spectra of 16 cyg a and b within 30 minutes of each other on december 22 , 1999 , with the mcdonald observatory 2.7 m telescope .",
    "we employed the coud echelle spectrograph ( tull et al .",
    "1995 ) and a 2048x2048 tektronix ccd , and made no changes to the instrument between the two observations .",
    "we achieved a resolving power of 58,000 ( as measured on a th - ar lamp spectrum ) with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath2400 per pixel at 6700  .",
    "spectra of a hot star were also obtained within one hour and at a similar airmass in order to compensate for telluric features in the spectra of 16 cyg a and b.    data for 16 cyg a and b were reduced in as nearly an identical manner as possible , in both cases following the general method described in gonzalez ( 1997 ) .",
    "each image was processed with the same bias and flat fields , and corrections for scattered light were made with the same fitting functions in both spectra .",
    "in addition , continua of individual orders were normalized with exactly the same functions in both stars .",
    "these steps were undertaken to minimize possible systematic differences between line depths which would ultimately impact our differential analysis .",
    "our efforts yielded continuous one - dimensional spectra in the blue up to 5500  , with gaps thereafter up to roughly 10,000  .",
    "to eliminate potential bias in measuring the equivalent widths ( ews ) of spectral features , one of us ( gg ) renamed each spectrum , and the other ( cl ) performed the measurements and analysis with no prior knowledge of which spectrum was associated with which star .",
    "we employed a list of high - quality atomic lines used in our previous studies of planet bearing stars , and measured the ews of 60 fe i and 8 fe ii lines spanning broad ranges in @xmath5 from 0.09 to 6.22 ev and in ew from 4.7 to 119.8 m . in every case",
    "the ew was measured for a line first in one star , then immediately afterwards in the second star before moving on to the next line .",
    "this procedure was followed to minimize any systematic differences in ew measurements between the two stars .",
    "telluric contamination in some fe lines was addressed by dividing the science object spectra by that of a hot star , and where performed , this division , as well as considerations of blending by nearby features , was treated identically for each line in each star .",
    "our linelist and measured ew values are presented in table 1 .",
    "we employed the measured ews from  3.1 and associated @xmath3 values taken from gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to derive a set of basic stellar parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and [ fe / h ] ) and associated uncertainties for 16 cyg a and b , using the methods described extensively in g98 and gonzalez & vanture ( 1998 ) .",
    "briefly , all four of these parameters were systematically iterated with a recent version of the lte abundance code moog ( sneden , 1973 ) using kurucz model atmospheres ( 1993 ) until the mean fe i and fe ii abundances were equal and correlations of the individual fe i line abundances with both @xmath4 and the logarithm of reduced equivalent width ( rew ) were zero .    following the method described in gonzalez & vanture ( 1998 ) , uncertainties in @xmath8",
    "were determined from the standard deviation in the slope of a least - squares fit to the fe i vs. @xmath9 data .",
    "this resulting uncertainty in @xmath10 was summed in quadrature with the standard deviation in the slope of a least - squares fit to the fe i vs. @xmath4 data to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath6 .",
    "we combined theses uncertainties in @xmath4 and @xmath11 with the observed scatter in modeled fe i line abundances to calculate our final uncertainty in [ fe / h ] . level . ]    our results using these standard methods are presented in table 2 , and we confirm previous studies : 16 cyg a and b are very similar to each other , as well as to the sun .",
    "the pair are each slightly metal - enhanced relative to solar , however , with 16 cyg a presenting an 0.03 dex overabundance of fe relative to 16 cyg b , although this difference is not significant given our formal estimates of uncertainty .      to reduce the uncertainties in our estimates from  3.2 , we reanalyzed our ew data from these two stars employing a technique similar to that described and effectively utilized by langer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in searching for small metallicity variations amongst red giants in m92 .",
    "essentially , this method mirrors the  standard \" method discussed above , but instead of determining chemical abundances for each star by averaging the results determined from individual lines and subsequently comparing these averages between stars , it determines differential chemical abundances between stars by taking the differences in abundances calculated for each line _ individually_. this differential strategy effectively eliminates uncertainties in @xmath3 values , and allows one to take advantage of the increased precision in @xmath0[fe / h ] to further constrain differential values of the other stellar parameters .",
    "we used our values for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 from  3.2 to calculate [ fe / h ] for each line in each star , then determined differential fe i abundances ( @xmath0[fe / h ] ) for each line individually . '' values are of the form @xmath12 . ]",
    "if the @xmath0@xmath6 and @xmath13 values from  3.2 were both correct , then plots of @xmath0[fe / h ] vs. both @xmath4 and @xmath9 would be uncorrelated .",
    "our initial such plots using these `` @xmath0 '' values as inputs , however , showed slopes of @xmath14 dex / ev for @xmath0[fe / h ] vs. @xmath4 and @xmath15 dex/@xmath9 for @xmath0[fe / h ] vs. @xmath9 ( for comparison , these values in our standard analysis of 16 cyg a in  3.2 were @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ) .",
    "while these results are only slightly larger than their standard uncertainties , we note that they are both more precise and appreciably larger in magnitude than the final `` zero - slope '' conditions which resulted from our standard analysis .",
    "such correlations indicate that the values of @xmath0 @xmath6 and @xmath13 calculated from the results in table 2 are off by some amount , and so we iterated @xmath0@xmath6 and @xmath18 by changing @xmath19 and @xmath20 until these correlations were forced to zero .",
    "figure 1 presents a visualization of the effect of changing @xmath0@xmath6 and @xmath21 on the @xmath4 and @xmath9 slopes . for @xmath22 and 4.26 for 16 cyg a and b , respectively",
    ", we find our best solution at @xmath0@xmath23k and @xmath24 km / s , where the stated uncertainties were calculated in precisely the same manner as described in  3.2 .",
    "we note that these values are in very good agreement with our earlier , though less precise , results generated via the `` standard '' method .",
    "figures 2 ( a ) and ( b ) show our final plots of @xmath0[fe / h ] vs. both @xmath4 and @xmath9 for our optimal values of @xmath0@xmath6 and @xmath13 ; immediately apparent is the fact that for the vast majority of lines analyzed , @xmath0[fe / h ] is positive .",
    "we find a mean value of @xmath0[fe / h ] and its associated uncertainty of @xmath25 dex , where the stated uncertainty in @xmath0[fe / h ] was calculated via the method described in  3.2 , utilizing the uncertainties in @xmath0@xmath6 , @xmath13 , and the observed scatter of @xmath26 dex in individual line @xmath0[fe / h ] values .",
    "uncertainty in @xmath0@xmath7 produced an effect of @xmath27 dex in @xmath0[fe / h ] , and was not considered in the stated error of the mean value of @xmath0[fe / h ] .",
    "this uncertainty is in fact dominated by uncertainty in @xmath0@xmath6 , with a @xmath28k change effecting a @xmath29 dex change in @xmath0[fe / h ] .",
    "we note that the atmospheric parameters for 16 cyg a and b calculated using the `` standard '' method stand in good agreement with previous published studies  a heartening fact in light of discrepancies in ew measurements as well as variations in methodology among the various authors .",
    "we believe our absolute values are more reliable than those of other recent studies due to our use of more fe i lines spanning a larger range in @xmath4 and ew ( d00 , for example , only employed 20 fe i lines with the smallest @xmath4 and ew values being 2.18 ev and 24 m , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , using our method of differential analysis , we are able to fine - tune the observed values of @xmath0@xmath30 and @xmath13 , and as a result have shown for the first time a statistically significant difference in [ fe / h ] between 16 cyg a and b. in figure 3 we compare our resulting @xmath0[fe / h ] values with those of previous studies .",
    "the magnitude of this difference remains quite small , though , and while we have strived to eliminate possible systematic differences in our observations and analyses of these two stars , we must consider other potential mechanisms which might mimic true differences in chemical abundance before we can conclude that 16 cyg a is in fact enhanced in fe relative to 16 cyg b. most notably , measured values of [ fe / h ] are known to vary with chromospheric activity levels . a recent study of ca ii fluxes in planet - bearing stars by henry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , however , shows low values of @xmath31 for 16 cyg b , indicating little variability and surface activity .",
    "our own spectra confirm the low levels of ca ii h and k emission , and show no signs of significant differences between 16 cyg a and b in this regard .",
    "furthermore , _ hipparcos _",
    "data sets the photometric variability of each of these stars at the 0.0007 magnitude level .",
    "we therefore are confident that differences in chromospheric activity do not play a significant role in accounting for the measured values of @xmath0[fe / h ] .",
    "in addition , we examined possible systematic errors which might be introduced due to assumptions in our atmospheric modeling , such as the possibility that a difference in the temperature minimum between the two stars might yield differing values of [ fe / h ] for the same @xmath6 ( wallerstein , 1972 ) . to test against this , we compared the central absorption in the mg i triplet near 5170  , and found no evidence supporting differences in temperature minima between 16 cyg a and b. we further argue that given the common ages of @xmath32 gyr ( g98 ) and similar values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and luminosity of these two stars  confirmed independently from photometric analyses ( c.f .",
    "f93 )  it is unlikely that any systematic errors in this strictly differential study might be due to more subtle model assumptions , such as that of lte . we therefore conclude that our measured value of @xmath0[fe / h ] is reliable to the level of our stated uncertainty , and that the photosphere of 16 cyg a _ is _ significantly more iron - rich than that of 16 cyg b.      an obvious explanation for the observed value of @xmath0[fe / h ] is that it represents a primordial difference in the chemical composition of 16 cyg a and b. little high - resolution work exists on abundance differences between members of multiple star systems , however , and models of the formation of stellar systems are currently not sophisticated enough to address deviations in chemical abundance at the level of precision that we report here .",
    "we intend to actively pursue the former shortcoming by employing our differential method on a wide sample of stellar systems ; however , until such primordial fluctuations are at least empirically , if not theoretically constrained , there is little more that can be said for or against this hypothesis .",
    "if , on the other hand , the observed difference in [ fe / h ] is not entirely primordial , then it must be set by variations in the evolutionary history of these two stars .",
    "a potential clue to the responsible mechanisms may lie in the aforementioned fact that the li abundances of 16 cyg a and b differ by a factor of at least five ( d00 ) . while ryan ( 2000 ) has noted that planet - bearing stars do not as a whole appear to differ from the field population in their values of [ li / h ]  a finding supported by the larger sample discussed in gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2000 )  it remains a challenge for standard theories of stellar atmospheres and evolution to explain the large difference in [ li / h ] between 16 cyg a and b given the considerable similarity of their physical characteristics and presumably shared environmental history .    in response , various authors have discussed the possibility that the chemical composition of stellar photospheres can be affected by the presence of planetary companions .",
    "cochran et al . ( 1997 ) and king ( 1997 ) proposed that dynamical interactions between a rotating star and its protoplanetary disk might significantly alter the angular momentum evolution of the star , and hence the rate at which the star depletes li .",
    "this model is well supported by the recent investigations of li and be abundances reported by d00 , wherein these authors conclude that models of slow rotational mixing can explain the relative abundances of li and be in 16 cyg a and other anomolously li - rich f and g stars .",
    "such a mechanism can not explain the more subtle variation in fe which we report here , however .",
    "alternately , g98 proposed that the increased lithium content of 16 cyg a s photosphere may be the result of that star having consumed planetary material in its outer convection zone .",
    "such self - pollution by materials of either chondritic or gas - giant composition would indeed produce an increase in the li abundance , while only slightly affecting the fe and be abundances ( g98 , d00 ) .",
    "if our result indicating that 16 cyg a is slightly enhanced in fe relative to 16 cyg b is not a primordial effect , then it lends tentative support to this scenario . from the estimates presented by g98",
    ", we calculate that the observed difference in [ fe / h ] between 16 cyg a and b can be explained by the accretion of 2.5 m@xmath33 of chondritic or 0.3 m@xmath34 of gas giant material .",
    "the amount of li enhancement due to accretion of these bodies is difficult to determine , given the marked non - linear time , @xmath6 , and dynamical dependence of li depletion , along with the unkown timing of the putative accretion event(s ) .",
    "nevertheless , it remains plausible that the observed difference in li between 16 cyg a and b is explainable by accretion at some intermediate age .",
    "the authors are grateful to george wallerstein for helpful discussions and support through the kenilworth fund of the new york community trust , and to the anonymous referee whose helpful comments greatly increased the clarity of our manuscript .",
