    "the goal of the calice experimental program is to establish novel technologies for calorimetry in future collider experiments and to record electromagnetic and hadronic shower data with unprecedented three dimensional spatial resolution for the validation of simulation codes and for the test and development of reconstruction algorithms .",
    "such highly granular calorimeters are necessary to achieve an unprecedented jet energy resolution at the international linear collider @xcite using particle flow algorithms @xcite .",
    "the calice analog hadron calorimeter ( ahcal ) prototype is a 38 layers sampling calorimeter , which is built out of scintillator tiles with sizes ranging from @xmath0mm@xmath1 in the core of the detector to @xmath2mm@xmath1 .",
    "the light in each scintillator cell is collected by a wavelength shifting fiber , which is coupled to a silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) sipm .",
    "the sipms are produced by the mephi / pulsar group @xcite .",
    "they have a photo - sensitive area of @xmath3mm@xmath1 containing 1156 pixels with a size of @xmath4m@xmath1 . in total",
    ", the calorimeter has 7608 channels . a built - in led calibration system with uv leds ,",
    "is coupled to each cell by clear fibers , and equipped with pin diodes to monitor the led light intensity .",
    "the performance of the ahcal was validated with positrons at various energies .",
    "good linearity and satisfactory agreement with simulation up to an energy of 50 gev has been observed .",
    "the high granularity of the active layers in the hadronic calorimeter and the cell - by - cell readout gives the calice detectors unprecedented imaging capabilities .",
    "this is exploited to study the topology of hadronic events in detail .",
    "track segments created by charged particles produced within the hadronic shower can be identified , provided the particles travel an appreciable distance before interacting again and are separated from other activity in the detector .",
    "figure [ fig : hcaltracksegments ] demonstrated that three tracks were found within one 25 gev @xmath5 event .",
    "the properties of these tracks are sensitive to the substructure of the hadronic shower , and can thus serve as a powerful probe for hadronic shower models .",
    "the track segments identified in hadronic showers have a high quality , and are suitable for detector calibrations via the extraction of the most probable value of the energy loss in each cell along the track . in the calice detector prototype",
    ", this technique was used to study the temperature dependence of the detector response @xcite .",
    "due to the underground location , the orientation of the detector layers , the power pulsing of the front end electronics , and due to the high granularity , calibrating a hadronic calorimeter with approximately 8 million channels at a future ilc detector is a significant challenge .",
    "cosmic rays might not be sufficient for monitoring the energy scale in - situ .",
    "the track segments can be used for calibration purposes . a simulation study performed with a model of a complete ilc detector showed that a layer by layer calibration to a precision of better than 5% can be achieved with an integrated luminosity of 10 pb@xmath6 at the z@xmath7 resonance .",
    "figure [ fig : calibration ] shows the integrated luminosity required for the calibration of individual electronic subunits ( 144 cells ) , and illustrates the distribution of the number of found tracks within the calorimeter volume . at 500 gev , this can be achieved with two weeks worth of data , for a calibration of the first 20 layers , one day is sufficienct .",
    "the single photon resolution of the sipms , together with an led light system , can be used to perform a gain calibration of the photon sensor , and to monitor changes due to short term variations of environmental parameters . for a channel - by - channel intercalibration of the complete cell response ,",
    "particles are necessary . before installation , such a calibration can be performed in a beam , analogous to the muon calibration currently used for the calice detector system.@xcite monitoring of long term variations , such as changes in the light yield of the scintillator have then to be performed in - situ .",
    "this can be achieved with track segments which are identified within the hadronic showers . to determine the requirement of calibration accuracy for the calorimeter of an ilc detector",
    ", a study has been preformed for the scintillation - tile hadron calorimeter , based on full detector simulations .",
    "these studies demonstrate that spreads up to 10% in the layer to layer and cell by cell intercalibrations do not lead to a noticeable degradation of the overall performance in terms of the diijet energy resolution with particle flow algorithms .",
    "the calibration strategy was tested on real data by transporting calibration constants from a fermilab beam test to data recorded at cern .",
    "two ways of transporting have been used , one based on the known temperature and voltage dependence of the sipm response , and one based on measured changes in gain .",
    "figure [ fig : combin2 ] a shows a set of pion runs taken at cern in the energy range 8 to 80 gev were analyzed .",
    "the residual from linearity for the reference cern calibration and for the two transported calibration sets were calculated .",
    "the hadronic energies calibrated with fnal transported coefficients are approximately 5% higher than the reference cern calibration sample .",
    "the two transport methods are in agreement with each other .",
    "the nonlinearity of the detector response is due to the requirement of full containment . after applying to all",
    "energy points an unique layer - by - layer correction derived from the identified track segments , a clear improvement in the agreement between different calibration methods is observed in figure [ fig : combin2 ] b. this demonstrates that an intercalibration of the detector modules in a beam before installation , and a layer - wise calibration with track segments after installation using regular physics data is sufficient to guarantee stable performance of the calorimeter at a future linear collider ."
