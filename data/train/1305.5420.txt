    "the two collaborations atlas and cms at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have found a new resonant state of mass near 126 gev @xcite , purported to be the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "the immediate task after the discovery of this state it to establish whether it really is the higgs boson of the standard model or whether there is physics beyond it ( bsm ) .",
    "in particular , the early measurements have not yet ascertained any of the higgs couplings to fermions , the yukawa couplings of the standard model .",
    "this leaves open the more general possibility of a symmetry breaking sector separate from a fermion mass generation sector as in the early technicolor models @xcite . in general , even the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and that of fermion mass generation need not coincide @xcite and this motivates us to investigate deviations in the top - quark - higgs coupling from its sm value . of course",
    ", this possibility is not as exotic as it may first appear as even a simple two higgs doublet model relaxes the proportionality between the fermion mass and its coupling to the ( lightest ) higgs boson .    we will not concern ourselves with a detailed model of this kind .",
    "instead we will be interested in the purely phenomenological question of constraining the values of the top - quark coupling to the observed higgs boson using the current data .",
    "the main ingredients for this study are the one - loop couplings of the higgs boson , namely its production via gluon fusion and its decay into two photons and into @xmath1 as these modes involve a top - quark loop and therefore the top - quark higgs coupling .",
    "the experimental uncertainty in these measurements allows for a range of possible top - quark yukawa couplings which we will discuss first .",
    "we then study the interplay between the allowed range for the top - quark - higgs coupling and bsm particles that can change the one - loop higgs processes .",
    "in particular we will consider a simple extension of the scalar sector of the sm with new scalars @xmath2 transforming as @xmath3 under the sm gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "this color octet , electroweak doublet , scalar extension of the sm is that of ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated by the requirement of minimal flavor violation @xcite , and we have recently constrained the relevant parameters with unitarity and vacuum stability arguments @xcite .",
    "in the sm the top - quark coupling to the higgs boson is uniquely determined by its mass as the yukawa interaction reads : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the third generation sm quark doublet , @xmath7 is the scalar doublet , @xmath8 and the top - quark acquires a mass when electroweak symmetry is broken and the higgs field develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath9 , @xmath10  gev .",
    "[ lyuk ] then leads to the couplings @xmath11 the @xmath12 coupling , @xmath13 , is thus fixed by the top - quark mass as @xmath14 .    beyond the sm",
    ", however , this no longer holds . in a model independent manner",
    "we can describe physics bsm with an effective lagrangian that respects the symmetries of the sm .",
    "if we accept the 126  gev state observed at lhc as a fundamental scalar , the appropriate effective lagrangian for bsm physics with terms up to dimension six is that of buchmuller and wyler @xcite .",
    "one sees that already at dimension six there are terms in the lagrangian modifying eq .",
    "for example , the term @xmath15 suffices to spoil the proportionality between the top - quark mass and its coupling to the higgs boson . in the presence of this term the @xmath12 coupling and the top - quark mass",
    "are modified to @xmath16 this distinction is of course model dependent but for our phenomenological study we will simply allow for an arbitrary @xmath12 coupling parametrized by @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 we thus have @xmath19 .",
    "to alter the loop induced couplings of the higgs boson , we will consider a model in which the scalar sector is augmented with a color octet , electroweak doublet in keeping with minimal flavor violation  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of this model has been studied extensively @xcite so we keep its discussion to a minimum .",
    "the inclusion of the new multiplet @xmath2 introduces several new , renormalizable , interaction terms to the lagrangian .",
    "because @xmath2 has non - trivial @xmath4 quantum numbers , it will have corresponding gauge interactions .",
    "in addition there will be new terms in the yukawa couplings and in the higgs potential that are consistent with minimal flavor violation .",
    "only three of the nine new parameters will affect our discussion in this paper and they appear in the scalar potential of ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath20 the first term is the same as the sm scalar potential and we use the conventional definition of @xmath21 and of @xmath22  gev .",
    "the traces are over the color indices and the @xmath23 indices @xmath24 are displayed explicitly .    for our numerical discussion",
    "we will eliminate @xmath25 by using the custodial symmetry relation @xmath26 .",
    "we will also restrict the ranges of @xmath27 and @xmath28 according to their unitarity and vacuum stability constraints recently derived .",
    "in particular we will use two conditions :    * the tree - level unitarity constraint as described in ref .",
    "@xcite which can be summarized by @xmath29 * the renormalization group improved ( rgi ) unitarity constraint of the coupled equations for @xmath21 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 satisfied up to a large scale of @xmath30  gev .",
    "this produces an allowed region shown in figure  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite which we import for this paper ( the blue region in figure  [ l1l2bounds ] ) .",
    "roughly , it can be thought of as the area limited by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the masses of the scalars contributing to the one - loop higgs couplings to gluons and photons are given in terms of the parameters of eq .",
    "[ potential ] by @xcite @xmath33 their contribution to the effective couplings is reviewed in the appendix .",

    "the black curve shows the rates obtained by allowing @xmath17 to differ from 1 but without additional scalars ( hence @xmath52 ) .",
    "we see that at the @xmath39 level , the data permits a 20% excursion from the sm value , as the range @xmath53 is allowed .",
    "notice that for @xmath54 , which is the sm , the values for @xmath50 and @xmath48 are not the closest point to the best fit values to data . in the sm ( no color octet )",
    ", the amplitude for @xmath55 has contributions from a w loop and a top loop with different signs and with the latter being proportional to @xmath17 . allowing @xmath56 to be smaller than 1 ,",
    "the cancellation between w and top - quark loops is reduced resulting in a larger branching ratio for @xmath57 and therefore in a better fit to the data .",

    "in the previous discussion of constraints on the top - quark coupling to higgs , we have implicitly assumed that changing the top yukawa coupling does not modify the fitted contours from ref .",
    "this assumption is justified for the following reasons .",
    "the first one is that the main channel for higgs production is gluon - gluon fusion in which the top quark only appears in the loop . in the decay channel ,",
    "only higgs to di - photon is involved with top .",
    "so the effects of changing the top coupling can be parametrized as @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the second reason is that the direct measurement of the top yukawa through @xmath64 is not yet very restrictive , the current limit being about 5 times the sm value@xcite . at present @xmath65 $ ]",
    "is allowed by @xmath66 alone .",
    "in addition , since the color - octet scalar does not develop a vev , the tree level @xmath67 and @xmath68 couplings are not changed .",

    "we now study the predicted region allowed for this branching ratio .",

    "<S> after the discovery of a 126 gev state at the lhc it is imperative to establish whether this particle really is the higgs boson of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the early measurements have not yet pinpointed any of the higgs couplings to fermions , the yukawa couplings of the standard model . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the values of the top - quark - higgs coupling , @xmath0 , that are still allowed by the one - loop couplings of the higgs to two gluons or two photons . </S>",
    "<S> we first assume that both the gluon fusion production of the higgs and its decay into two photons proceed through loops with standard model particles only , albeit with an arbitrary top - higgs coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current higgs data still allows for 20% deviations in @xmath0 from its standard model value . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the effect of new particles contributing to the effective one - loop couplings . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we consider a color octet electroweak doublet extension of the scalar sector and find that in this case @xmath0 is allowed to deviate by 40% from its standard model value by the current data . </S>"
