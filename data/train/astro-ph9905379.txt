    "nova muscae 1998 was discovered on 1998 december 29 ( liller 1998 ) at @xmath0=8.5 .",
    "the light curve of the nova during the first 100 days followed outburst , which was compiled from various sources is shown in fig .",
    "we estimate that the time to decline by two magnitudes is : @xmath1 day .",
    "the object is therefore classified as a very fast nova .",
    "1 also displays oscillations with time scales of several days , and full amplitude of about one magnitude in the light curve of the nova during days 20 - 60 after maximum light .",
    "this phase of the nova is known as the transition phase .",
    "it is unclear why certain novae experience this behaviour in their light curves ( leibowitz 1993 ) .",
    "we observed nova mus 1998 during 17 nights in 1999 .",
    "the observations were carried out using the 20-cm telescope in vina del mar , chile , and the 45-cm telescope in loomberah , australia .",
    "ccds and broad band filters were used .",
    "most of the observations were obtained during the transition phase of the nova .",
    "the highest peak in the power spectrum ( not shown ) corresponds to the period 0.16930 day + /-0.00015 .",
    "in the power spectrum there are a few more peaks with possible inter - connections , however they are below the significance level",
    ". the nova might thus be classified as an intermediate polar candidate .    in table 1 .",
    "we summarize the properties of all novae , which are intermediate polar systems or intermediate polar candidates .",
    "although the information is scarce , the data suggest that there might be a connection between the two groups .",
    "this link may be related with the evidence for the early presence of the accretion disc in young novae ( retter 1999 ) ."
