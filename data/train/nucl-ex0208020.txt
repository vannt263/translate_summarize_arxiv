    "as a function of the number of charged particles in the acceptance window @xmath8 for central pb+pb collisions.,height=275 ]     as a function of the number of charged particles in the acceptance window @xmath8 for central pb+pb collisions.,height=275 ]    it has been suggested that charge fluctuations might be sensitive to the presence of a quark qluon plasma phase @xcite .",
    "a suitable observable , however , must take into account the effect of impact parameter fluctuations , acceptance effects , the total net charge of the reaction system , and charge conservation .",
    "for this purpose a generalized @xmath9 measure @xcite can be employed : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the event multiplicity , while @xmath12 is the quantity to be studied .",
    "the overline denotes the average over a single particle inclusive distribution , whereas @xmath13 means the average over all events . in the case of charge fluctuations",
    ", @xmath12 is chosen as the electric charge @xmath14 of a particle @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 can vary between two extreme cases : for independent particle emission @xmath15 is equal to 0 , while local charge conservation would imply @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : phiq ] shows the measured @xmath15 values in central pb+pb reactionsgev : 7% most central , 158 @xmath1gev : 10% most central ] at 40 , 80 , and 158 @xmath1gev beam energy .",
    "@xmath15 depends strongly on the ratio of accepted charged particles to the total number of charged particles @xmath17 , which is varied by changing the accepted rapidity window @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is approximately independent of the beam energy . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiq ] labelled @xmath18 represents the expectation for a system with total net charge zero , in which the only correlations are due to global charge conservation .",
    "@xmath19 in order to enlarge any deviations from this trivial effect , the difference @xmath20 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphiq ] .",
    "it is found that @xmath21 is close to zero .    to study the sensitivity of the @xmath21 measure a model , describing a quark gluon plasma , was investigated @xcite .",
    "this model assumes an ideal gas of massless quarks and gluons in equilibrium with zero baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the requirement of entropy and local charge conservation during hadronization allows to extract predictions for @xmath21 in different scenarios .",
    "[ fig : dphiq ] includes two extreme cases : the one labelled `` frozen qgp '' assumes hadronization only into pions and no diffusion of the net charge in rapidity space , so that the initial qgp - like fluctuations are conserved .",
    "in fact , this results in @xmath21 values clearly below zero . in the other scenario ( `` resonances '' )",
    "hadronization is happening entirely into @xmath23-mesons .",
    "it turns out that in this case the initial fluctuations are completely obscured by the subsequent decay of the resonances , which cause a smearing of the original qgp fluctuations in rapidity space .       for forward rapidities ( 4.0 @xmath24 5.5 ) as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "included are p+p , c+c , and si+si reactions ( filled symbols ) , as well as centrality selected pb+pb reactions ( open symbols ) , all at 158 @xmath1gev.,height=377 ]    for the study of event - by - event @xmath0 fluctuations again the @xmath9 observable , defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : phix ] , is used .",
    "this time , however , @xmath12 is replaced by the @xmath26 of a given particle .",
    "independent particle emission will again result in @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 values , shown in fig .  [ fig : phipt ] , are all corrected for the effects of the two track resolution of the detector .",
    "generally , it is found that @xmath28 is small for all investigated reaction systems : @xmath29 .",
    "a weak centrality dependence is observable , with a maximum in @xmath28 for very peripheral pb+pb collisions .",
    "also , @xmath28 is clearly charge dependent : @xmath28 is always larger for negatively charged particles than for positively charged .",
    "this may be a reflection of the fact that the positively charged particles contain a larger fraction of baryons , which are subject to fermi - dirac statistics , while the negatively charged particles are dominated by bosons @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath28 for all charged particles is still higher than for the negatively charged ones , indicating that there are additional correlations present .",
    "all figures are on the same scale.,height=453 ]    since @xmath28 is a global observable , a small value of @xmath28 does not neccessarily imply the absence of any strong correlation .",
    "it is also possible that contributions of two effects just cancel out each other .",
    "looking at two particle correlations provides a more differential way of studying @xmath0 fluctuations @xcite . in the procedure employed here ,",
    "first the @xmath26 of a given particle is transformed into a cumulative variable @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath30 then two particle correlation plots are generated by plotting @xmath31 versus @xmath32 for all particle pairs inside one event .",
    "figure  [ fig : x1x2 ] shows the result for different reactions systems at 158 @xmath1gev .",
    "while there is a clear structure visible in p+p reactions , reflecting the long range correlations present in this case , these structures get more and more diluted when going to larger systems . on one side",
    "this is naturally due to the effect of the increased combinatorics between the growing number of particle pairs , an effect that is removed by the @xmath28 measure . on the other side differences in the reaction dynamics between elementary p+p and nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "will show up in the two particle correlations .",
    "the relation between @xmath28 and the two particle correlations is still under study .     to central pb+pb data at 158 @xmath1gev ( right hand side ) .",
    "please note that the data are on a different scale than in fig .",
    "[ fig : x1x2].,height=226 ]    to see how dynamical fluctuations affect the two particle correlations , a model study is performed . in this model",
    "the only source of fluctuations are the event - by - event fluctuations of the slope parameter @xmath33 of the transverse momentum spectra . as can be seen on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xsim ] , @xmath33 fluctuations of the order of 10% already result in a very prominent structure in the two particle correlation .",
    "a structure on this level is clearly absent in the central pb+pb data ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xsim ] ) .",
    "here only short range correlations ( e.g. bose einstein correlations ) are visible as an enhancement close to the diagonal .",
    "a comparison of the measured @xmath28 in the 5% most central pb+pb reactions at 158 @xmath1gev to a prediction for small @xmath33 fluctuations @xcite actually suggests that @xmath34 is smaller than 1% .",
    "the radius parameters shown in fig .  [ fig : pionhbt ] are derived from the fit of the bertsch - pratt parametrization in the lcms @xmath35 to the h@xmath4h@xmath4 correlation function ( c.f . ) .",
    "the coulomb correction is included in the fit procedure , and is applied only to the fraction of real pairs in the c.f . for both beam energies the pairs are in the c.m .",
    "rapidity region @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the radius parameters in side and out direction show a significant increase with the system size .",
    "@xmath38 , however , shows no clear evidence for a variation with @xmath25 , except perhaps for very central reactions .",
    "the results at 40 and 158 @xmath1gev are very similar .",
    "figure  [ fig : kaonhbt ] shows the c.f . of charged kaons together with the applied fit of the bertsch pratt parametrization .",
    "the data points are corrected for the coulomb interaction and the momentum resolution .",
    "the table summarizes the values of the radius parameters together with statistical and systematical errors .",
    "also included are published results from the na44 collaboration @xcite on k@xmath3 correlations that agree quite well with our measurement .      apart from the effect of quantum statistics , the c.f .",
    "reflects also the influence of the final state interaction .",
    "this can be exploited to gain useful information from correlations between non identical particles .",
    "results on @xmath5p correlations allow to study relative space time asymmetries @xcite , and @xmath6p correlation give access to the source size @xcite .",
    "additionally , one can use the c.f . as a tool to learn about the two particle interaction in cases where it is unknown , like in the @xmath7 case @xcite .",
    "the above correlations are studied in the variable : @xmath39        since the relative wave function of pairs of non identical particles contains odd terms in @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the emission points in the pair c.m .",
    ", relative space time asymmetries should become visible in the ratio @xmath42 . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the c.f . containing all pairs with @xmath44 , while @xmath45 consists of pairs with @xmath46 , where the out - direction is defined in the lcms .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pipasym ] a clear asymmetry is observed in the data , which goes into opposite directions for @xmath47p and @xmath48p pairs .",
    "this mirror symmetry is caused by the fact that the aymmetry in @xmath42 is effected mainly by the coulomb interaction , which introduces a dependence on the charge sign .",
    "additionally , fig .",
    "[ fig : pipasym ] includes the result from a rqmd simulation . due to its long range character",
    "the coulomb interaction is very sensitive to the tails in the spatial distribution of the source .",
    "the simulated emission points have been scaled by a factor of 0.8 in accordance with the analysis of @xmath49 and @xmath50p correlation functions .",
    "figure  [ fig : plam ] shows the measured c.f .",
    ", containing 60k pairs with @xmath52 , together with theoretical c.f .",
    "fitted to the data .",
    "the calculation is based on an effective range approximation , using a s - wave scattering length of @xmath53 -2.3 fm ( singlet ) / -1.8 fm ( triplet ) @xcite .",
    "the gaussian source is assumed to be spherically symmetric and static , and is defined by the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig : plam ] includes two different fits . in the first @xmath54 and",
    "the @xmath55 parameter can vary freely . in the second @xmath55",
    "is fixed to a value that is estimated from the background of particle misidentification and the contribution from feed down .",
    "both fits suggest a gaussian source size of @xmath54 = 3 - 4 fm , which is compatible with the na49 result on pp correlations ( @xmath56 ) @xcite .      the significance of the measured @xmath57 c.f .",
    ", shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamlam ] , is unfortunately limited by low statistics ( 3500 pairs with @xmath52 ) and does not show any clear structure . nevertheless , it is worthwhile to do a comparison to theoretical expectations , in an attempt to limit the range of possible parameter values .",
    "therefore , a fit is performed where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are now fixed and the scattering length @xmath58 , describing the strengh of the interaction , is varied .",
    "the result indicates that the c.f . would favour a relatively small @xmath58 , quite independent from the assumed source size . as a comparison a calculation with @xmath58 = -20 fm",
    "is also shown , which would correspond to the scattering length in the nucleon - nucleon case , and which looks rathers unlikely , although is is not totally ruled out .          from the measurement of proton and deuteron spectra ( all at mid - rapidity for central reactionsgev : 7% most central , 158 @xmath1gev : 5% most central ] ) , a deuteron coalescence factor @xmath59",
    "can be derived : @xmath60 figure  [ fig : b2energy ] displays the extracted @xmath59 for different beam energies , also including data from the ags and other cern sps experiments .",
    "@xmath59 decreases significantly with increasing beam energy . even in the sps energy range ,",
    "taken alone , there is a change by a factor of 2 .",
    "@xmath59 is also strongly dependent on the system size , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2size ] . going from very peripheral to central reactions , it decreases by a factor of almost 10 .",
    "this is in contrast to the centrality dependence of the radii from bose einstein correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pionhbt ] ) , which can be related to @xmath59 via @xcite : @xmath61{r_{{\\mbox{\\rm \\scriptsize side}}}^{2 } r_{{\\mbox{\\rm \\scriptsize long}}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is demonstrated in fig .",
