    "the goal of clarifying the nature of qso absorption line systems drives the interest in extreme low redshift absorption systems such as the `` sub - damped lyman-@xmath0 '' absorber in the sight line to the @xmath16 agn pg1216 + 069 . at a heliocentric redshift velocity of 1895  km  s@xmath7",
    ", the absorber falls in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , where its association with a particular galaxy host or group / cluster environment should become clear through observation .",
    "tripp et al.s recent , comprehensive study of pg1216 + 069 @xcite makes it clear that ( 1 ) the metallicity is low , [ o / h]@xmath17 - 1.6 , but at a characteristic level for high redshift absorbers , ( 2 ) there is no detected optical emission from the absorber itself nor an obvious association with a specific galaxy in the field , and ( 3 ) the hi column density through the absorber @xmath18@xmath19 is a factor 10 below the damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dla ) class .",
    "while the lower limit to dla column density @xmath20@xmath19 was originally set as a completeness limit in the early surveys @xcite , this column density also takes on physical significance in disk galaxies , since it is typical of the threshold column density for the onset of star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite used an extensive data set of 21 cm line observations to demonstrate the consistence between qso absorption line statistics and the cross sections that @xmath21 galaxies present for absorption .",
    "zwaan et al .",
    "further demonstrate that the decline in metal abundance for low column density absorbers agrees with abundance gradients in the outskirts of nearby galaxies .",
    "qso absorption statistics indicate through the @xmath22 distribution @xcite that populations of low column density absorbers present larger cross sections than the dla class , implying that clouds with @xmath23@xmath19 may be more common than the higher @xmath24 ones in spiral galaxy disks .",
    "radio telescopes routinely observe @xmath24 well below this level , thereby providing the incentive for a wsrt reconnaissance into the pg1216 + 069 field .",
    "@xcite observed this field with gmrt within the same time frame without detecting the new features we report here .",
    "the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observed the field centered on pg1216 + 069 in `` filler time '' scheduled through the interim proposal system . rather than a single long integration in one 12 hour integration ,",
    "the observation consists of two shorter runs . on 2004",
    "august 14 , the first session , covering extreme negative hour angles , produced 4.5 hours on source in the `` 2@xmath25144 m '' configuration ( with rt9 to movable telescope distances of 144 , 288 , 1368 , and 1440 meters ) .",
    "on 2004 august 27 , the second session covered 4 hours of extreme positive hour angles in the `` maxi - short '' configuration ( rt9 to movable telescopes distances of 36 , 90 133 , 1404 meters ) .",
    "the dzb spectrometer analyzed both linear polarizations with a 10 mhz ( @xmath142000 km  s@xmath7 ) band centered on heliocentric redshift velocity 1900  km  s@xmath7 with 256 spectral channels per polarization to obtain channel spacing of 8.3  km  s@xmath7 or velocity resolution of 16.5  km  s@xmath7 after hanning smoothing .",
    "for an east - west array such as wsrt , observing sources close to the celestial equator has two important consequences : the negative one is that the telescope resolution in the north - south direction deteriorates at low declination @xmath26 as @xmath27 , so that the best resolution possible for pg1216 + 069 is a north - south fan beam of 108@xmath2813@xmath15 .",
    "the positive consequence is that all projected baselines foreshorten at large hour angle @xmath29 as @xmath30 , so that the apparent lack of short spacings in the `` 2@xmath25144 m '' configuration data does not damage the surface brightness sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "short spacing sensitivity is limited to @xmath3125 m projected spacings in order to avoid shadowing of one dish by its neighbor , causing the observation to be insensitive to smooth structure on angular scales larger than @xmath1415 arcminutes ( 115  kpc ) .    data processing steps included editing , calibration and application of different weighting schemes in the synthesis imaging software packages aips and miriad .",
    "this produced spectral line data cubes with a range of resolution and noise level , summarized in table  [ noiselevel.tab ] .",
    "for each of three weighting schemes , the table lists the angular resolution and noise level @xmath32 measured from the processed data cubes .",
    "assuming that the emission fills the synthesized beam solid angle @xmath33 leads to a surface brightness sensitivity ( @xmath34 ) and column density sensitivity ( @xmath35 @xmath19 ) .",
    "the table includes estimates of the flux density that a beam filled with @xmath36@xmath19 would produce , along with the hi mass contained within the beam ( @xmath37m@xmath6 ) , assuming the distance of 26.6  mpc , which @xcite adopted .",
    "analysis of the continuum image formed from the average of the channels free of hi signal found that pg1216 + 069 had a continuum flux density of 2.7@xmath380.2  mjy at 1416 mhz ( consistent with the 2.8@xmath390.3  mjy measurement of @xcite ) .",
    "the nvss survey @xcite indicates an upper limit @xmath141.9  mjy ( @xmath40 ) , while vlba observations indicated compact structure of 5.7@xmath380.3  mjy in the period 1999 - 2000 @xcite .",
    "the pg1216 + 069 agn appears to be a variable radio source .",
    "figures  [ hi_field.fig ] and [ spectra.fig ] summarize the observational results .",
    "fig  [ hi_field.fig ] presents contours of the integral line emission , obtained from the zeroth moment of the spectral channels after automated masking using a smoothed version of the cube .",
    "the image is 1 degree on a side , corresponding to 460  kpc .",
    "the half power beam width of the wsrt primary beam is @xmath1435  arcmin , so the outer regions of hi map include the first null of the pattern .",
    "table  [ galaxies.tab ] lists the galaxies with redshift less than 3000  km  s@xmath7 within 25 arcmin of the pg1216 + 069 sight line ; many of these are marked in fig  [ hi_field.fig ] .",
    "figure  [ spectra.fig ] presents spectra for selected areas of the image .",
    "figure  [ hi_field.fig ] shows three significant detections for systems vcc297 , vcc415 , and a previously unreported hi emitter , here named wsrt - j121918 + 0624 , centered at coordinates 12@xmath4119@xmath4217@xmath43.6 , 06@xmath4424@xmath4506@xmath15 ( j2000 ) , close in the sky to vcc327 .",
    "the hipass online database shows this feature with @xmath46 significance .",
    "the hi mass in wsrt - j121918 + 0624 amounts to @xmath47 contained in a gaussian profile of fwhm @xmath1438  km  s@xmath7 centered on @xmath48 1963  km  s@xmath7 , but the 800  km  s@xmath7 difference in redshift from vcc327 suggest that this is but chance alignment between two unassociated objects .",
    "however , the ned indicates that there are at least seven objects ( ngc4223 , vcc287 , vcc297 , vcc332 , wsrt - j121918 + 0624 , vcc339 , vcc346 ) with velocities in the 400  km  s@xmath7 range 1870 to 2270 within a 300  kpc square area projected on the sky .",
    "there is weak evidence that wsrt - j121918 + 0624 is extended toward the ne , in which case the morphology would be typical of tidal debris from interactions within the overdensity , similar to the structures seen in ursa major @xcite and elsewhere in virgo @xcite .",
    "the catalogued galaxy closest to the pg1216 sight line is vcc329 with a velocity offset of 292  km  s@xmath7 relative to the sub - dla , but there is no hint of an hi signal in the wsrt data ( see fig  [ spectra.fig ] )",
    ".    inspection of the spectrum along the line of sight to pg1216 + 069 reveals a weak emission feature at @xmath49 , overlapping the velocity of the sub - dla absorber .",
    "the peak strength is 1.7@xmath380.55mjy ; for well behaved noise , there is only a 0.14% probability of a 3@xmath3 positive deflection occurring in a pre - chosen pixel by chance .",
    "the velocity width is not well constrained , and considering widths in the range 20 - 60 km  s@xmath7 would indicate hi masses of 5 to 15@xmath50 .",
    "the strength of the feature is between 1.5 and 1.7  mjy per beam for all three synthesized beams in table  [ noiselevel.tab ] , implying that a large fraction of the emission is likely to be contained within the @xmath51 beam .",
    "unless the hi spatial distribution is similar in shape to the elongated beam , the hi column density must vary in places to values above that specified by the damping wing profile of @xcite .",
    "the signal strength measured by wsrt indicating 5@xmath50 for a 16  km  s@xmath7 velocity width is compatible with the gmrt upper limit of 11@xmath50 for a 20  km  s@xmath7 velocity width and @xmath52 angular resolution .",
    "a rough rule of thumb for estimation of the optical brightness of a late type , gas rich galaxy is @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "an @xmath54 translates to @xmath55 - 14.9 , with large scatter . with a distance modulus equal 32.1",
    ", the integral optical emission would be magnitude 17 and possibly much dimmer as would be typical of a low mass , diffuse lsb system .",
    "the optical emission must compete with the qso light ( magnitude 15.84 , 15.65 , and 15.61 in the b , @xmath56 and @xmath57 bands , respectively ) and a star 10@xmath15 away that is tabulated at @xmath58 ( according to @xcite derived from an image in which it is saturated ) .",
    "the apmcatapmcat/ ] evaluates the sum of the star plus qso as @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the hi emission properties of the pg1216 + 069 sub - dla absorber are consistent with expectations based on the low column density , low metallicity and absence of optical emission from a clear host galaxy .",
    "low column density below the star formation threshold means that the lack of star formation locally along the line of sight is no surprise . a low metallicity cloud with no connection to a optically identified host galaxy is compatible with the sub - dla originating in a tiny , extreme low surface brightness dwarf of primitive composition or being a diffuse cloud in the outer halo of a galaxy such as vcc339 or vcc297 .",
    "the additional presence in this field of the more massive cloud wsrt - j121918 + 0624 may argue for an origin for both features as tidal debris in this overdense volume .",
    "( the tranverse dimension of the field in fig .",
    "[ hi_field.fig ] is 460  kpc , thus fitting easily within local group , for example . )",
    "further progress might be made by ( 1 ) longer integrations on this field with the goal of tracing low column density structures that may form a more obvious link to the visible galaxies in this overdensity and ( 2 ) more extensive , deep hi mapping in several other fields to identify examples of objects ( dwarfs or halo clouds ) in more favorable situations ( i.e. , without optically bright qsos cluttering the field ) .",
    "such populations might account for the sub - dla and lyman - limit absorption cross sections .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope , especially rene vermeulen and tony foley for coordinating the observations through the interim proposal program .",
