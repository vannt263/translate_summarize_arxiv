    "we would like to point out that this lattice configuration can also be modified to realize a 2d ( the @xmath70 plane ) long - range interacting many - body system .",
    "note furthermore , that if only one of the magnetic sub - levels of @xmath113d@xmath114 is used experimentally ( as discussed in the manuscript ) one can achieve a magic lattice with less stringent laser field geometries .",

    "<S> the interaction strength can be comparable to the one typically achievable with polar molecules , i.e. three orders of magnitude stronger than among atoms with large magnetic dipole moments . compared to rydberg atoms </S>",
    "<S> the interactions are substantially weaker . </S>",
    "<S> however , the use of low - lying states makes our system less prone to perturbing electric fields and reduces the number of radiative decay channels and involved levels . </S>",
    "<S> this might offer an interesting perspective for the study of open quantum spin systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we specifically focus on bosonic strontium ( sr ) atoms trapped in a deep optical lattice in a mott insulator state and photons exchanged on the @xmath0p@xmath1d@xmath2-transition ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the radiative transitions between the two series are dipole forbidden , which - due to the resulting small transition line widths - leads to a wide range of applications , such as ultra precise atomic clocks @xcite or the implementation of quantum information processing protocols @xcite . here </S>",

    "<S> the transition dipole moment between the @xmath0p@xmath6 state and the three degenerate @xmath0d@xmath2-states is @xmath15 debye and effectuates a strong resonant dipole - dipole interaction that extends over several lattice sites as depicted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> this generates a rich playground for the discovery and study of many - body quantum phases .    </S>",
    "<S> _ dissipation and disorder.- _ we now discuss two seemingly harmful effects : collective dissipation due to radiative decay and disorder stemming from the uncertainty in the atomic positions . to analyze them </S>",
    "<S> we numerically simulate a situation in which a single excitation ( or hard - core boson ) propagates through a linear chain of @xmath90 sr atoms orientated along the @xmath91-direction under the action of @xmath75 and the corresponding dissipator . </S>",

    "<S> surprisingly , one can see that for @xmath59 the effective decay rate of the excitation is not only much smaller than the single - atom one @xmath92 , but more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the dipole - dipole interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this unexpected long lifetime of the excitation resides in the collective character of the dissipation and the emergence of sub - radiant states .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss disorder , which arises from the fact that the external wavefunction of each localized sr atom has a finite width . </S>",
    "<S> we model this wavefunction as a three - dimensional isotropic gaussian with width @xmath93 , localized on the respective lattice site . using the dipolar approximation for the interaction and assuming @xmath94 the couplings @xmath95 become random variables which are distributed according to @xmath96\\exp[-(r_{kl}- [ a / w_{kl}]^{1/3})^2/(2\\sigma^2)]$ ] , where @xmath97 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : transport]b , c and d for @xmath59 . with increasing ratio @xmath98 transport becomes less efficient and more population remains localized at the left of the lattice . beyond this simple illustration </S>",
    "<S> it will be very interesting to study the effect of this controllable disorder in the many - body context . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the ground state of hard - core bosons exhibits a localization transition for certain types of disorder @xcite in the hopping rates . </S>",
    "<S> it is an open question whether this transition is present also here .    </S>",
    "<S> _ spectroscopy on the few - body system.- _ finally , let us discuss the spectroscopic properties of the sr lattice system and find out whether they provide a clear experimental signature of the presence of long - range interactions . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the power spectrum of the radiation field @xmath99 scattered off the ensemble of atoms in the direction of observation @xmath100 driven by a weak incident laser field of frequency @xmath81 : @xmath101 . </S>",

    "<S> the dynamics of this driven ensemble is described by hamiltonian @xmath75 , the corresponding dissipator and the hamiltonian @xmath102 , which takes into account the action of the laser field with polarization @xmath85 . for the sake of simplicity we orient the laser beam such that its momentum @xmath82 is perpendicular to the chain ( see sketch in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the average excitation number on the @xmath106-th lattice site @xmath107 , corresponding to the states represented by two of the peaks is also sketched . ]    before discussing the results for a chain , let us first consider the case of two atoms , i.e. @xmath108 , where the problem can be treated analytically . here , the spectrum of the radiation @xmath104 consists of a single peak of lorentzian form @xmath109 $ ] with @xmath110 $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> this is due to two facts : ( i ) in this particular geometry ( the momentum of the laser being perpendicular to the interparticle separation ) the laser only couples to the ( super - radiant ) symmetric state and ( ii ) the symmetric and anti - symmetric states are eigenstates of the dissipator as well as of the hamiltonian and , hence , the dissipation induces no couplings between the symmetric and anti - symmetric states .    for a chain of @xmath90 atoms we have calculated the spectrum numerically and </S>",

    "<S> more interesting , however , is the emergence of a number of narrow peaks belonging to long - lived sub - radiant states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these lines appear due to the fact that the coherent and dissipative interaction do not share the same set of eigenstates . or in case of periodic boundary conditions </S>",

    "<S> we will furthermore investigate dynamical phases @xcite resulting from the interplay between dissipative and coherent dynamics and explore how the versatility of the sr platform can be further enhanced , e.g. , by the application of static electric and microwave fields .    _ </S>",
