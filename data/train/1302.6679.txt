    "we employ the self - consistent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) method to compute the relevant physics .",
    "we define @xmath15 as the threshold below which @xmath0-wave correlations are zero , and the significance of which is illustrated later .",
    "we find that @xmath15 initially increases with density and then decreases closer to half filling ( @xmath16=1 ) , showing a characteristic optimization behavior .",

    "it is worth while to point out that while the bdg studies on @xmath6-wave superconductors are fairly abundant , similar attempts on @xmath0-wave systems are limited .",
    "the problem is comprised by the fact that the attention that @xmath0-wave systems recieved is mostly restricted by very narrow regime of the parameter space .",
    "we believe that attainment of the self - consistency is the most crucial issue in all these studies , owing to , possibly a large number of competing ground states .",
    "we have been able to address this difficulty partially by a very thorough numerical investigation of the problem .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows : a brief introduction to the model hamiltonian is given in section - ii . in section - iii , we calculate the critical exchange potential , @xmath15 for two particles in 2d using the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model . in section - iv",
    ", we consider finite particle density and investigate superconducting pairing in general , and the impact of on - site coulomb repulsion on the pairing correlations , and finally on bcs - bec crossover by calculating the chemical potential and mean - pair radius .",
    "finally , we conclude in section - v .",
    "we model the 2d @xmath0-wave sc by the hamiltonian , @xmath17 the first term describes the kinetic energy , where @xmath1 is the hopping amplitude of electrons between nearest - neighbors @xmath18 with spin @xmath19 , @xmath2 is the pairing interaction strength between the nearest neighbour sites and @xmath3 is the on - site repulsive interaction .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath24 is adjusted to fix the average carrier density @xmath25 .",
    "for the sake of completeness and to compare and contrast with the results for finite electron density , we present the calculation of threshold exchange interaction in the extreme dilute limit , that is for two electrons in an empty lattice .",

    "it is interesting to note that , @xmath68 is higher that @xmath69 , despite the fact the latter is affected by the strong on - site repulsion .",
    "thus we conclude that for @xmath70 at low density , the ground state of the system is a bose condensate of fermion pairs having a @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry .     as function of pairing strength @xmath71 for a isotropic square lattice with @xmath6-wave and @xmath0-wave symmetry",

    "it is worthwhile to mention at this point that achieving self - consistency in our calculations is a significantly crucial issue , as a number of parameters demand simultaneous convergence , which as experienced by us , is a challenging task possibly because of a number of competing ground states .",
    "may be due to this difficulty ghosal @xmath94 @xmath95 have done their calculations by taking only one set of parameter values.@xcite thus an extensive search for self - consistent solution over a broad parameter space has been done , however with limited success . yet in our work we were able to scan a reasonable amount of parameter space defined by @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 , which has not been done earlier .",
    "we begin by studying the ground state properties and calculate the critical value of pairing energy @xmath15 which we defined as a threshold value below which pairing correlations are zero ( normal state ) .",
    "we find that @xmath15 depends strongly on the density and on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "then , we investigate the impact of coulomb repulsion on the bcs - bec crossover picture .",
    "the density range we are interested in is between quarter and half filling as the situation for lower densities is addressed in earlier studies .",

    "so in our case @xmath15 initially increases with density , with its value always less than 7.32@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jmin ] ) .",
    "close to half filling , the electrons naturally sit next to each other resulting in lower minimum pairing energy .",
    "hence the critical coupling shows a characteristic optimization behavior with particle density .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior stimulate our interest to investigate the bcs - bec crossover near half filling , where it always shows characteristics of a bcs state in the absence of @xmath3 .",
    "it may be noted that even though the two - body bound is insensitive to the value of the coulomb repulsion , the pairing correlation in a system with finite carrier density , this is no longer true .",
    "further , as our main focus is the larger density regime , so we do not address densities lower than qurter filling.@xcite    both the attractive pairing potential and electron density drive @xmath0-wave correlations , @xmath97 .",
    "as @xmath97 is direcly proportional to the pairing potential , it grows linearly with the strength of the potential for a fixed particle density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : del](a ) ) . further , the @xmath0-wave correlations depend upon the overlap of the electronic states , so @xmath97 increases with particle density .",
    "thus , for fixed values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 the correlations monotonically increase with density .",

    "although , as mentioned erlier , the on - site coulomb repulsion is not indispensably necessary for generating a two - body @xmath0-wave pairing state , we find that it has a significant role in @xmath0-wave pair formation and the bcs - bec crossover phenomena .",

    "these results are new and indicate the importance of coulomb repulsion on the crossover mechanism .",
    "the reason for choosing unusual parameter values ( @xmath104 @xmath71=1.5 and 4.9 ) is that , inspite of a thorough and careful search for the self - consistent solutions at other parameter values , the success was limited .",
    "however we could scan a broad density regime which has contributed to a lot more enriched study of the problem compared to what already exists .     as a function of pairing energy @xmath2 for different system sizes @xmath105 = 12 , 24 , and 32 with @xmath16 = 0.75 and @xmath98 = 2 fixed .",

    "a robust support of the crossover is provided by computing the pair radius which shrinks from tens of lattice spacing to that of a very few at the onset of crossover .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that going beyond the standard mean - field approach by including pair fluctuations within the attractive hubbard model , it was found that around half filling the smooth evolution from the bcs to the bec limits is interrupted.@xcite the transition temperature to a superfluid phase @xmath4 vanishes near half filling over an extended range for moderately strong attraction when the system approaches the bosonic regime .",
    "this vanishing is associated with the divergence of the mass of the pairs or localization of the pairs due to pairing fluctuations , which eventually destroys the superfluid state .",
