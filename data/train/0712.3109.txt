    "the near fermi level electronic structure of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials @xcite ( re@xmath0ae@xmath7mno@xmath2 , re @xmath8 rare earth , ae @xmath8 alkaline earth ) have been attracting much interest recently , particularly due to their importance in understanding the mechanism behind the insulator - metal ( i m ) transitions in these oxides .",
    "the ground state properties of these manganites are dominated mainly by the competition among four independent interactions : the magnetic interaction between the mn @xmath9 electron spins , the electron - phonon coupling , the electronic repulsion and the kinetic energy of the carriers .",
    "the behavior of doped manganites for @xmath10 and @xmath11 is drastically different and depends strongly on the competition among the above four interactions .",
    "these distorted perovskites undergo a transition from a ferromagnetic metallic ( fmm ) state to an antiferromagnetic insulating ( afmi ) state with the doping of charge carriers .",
    "however , for a commensurate fraction of the carrier concentration , the fmm state is easily suppressed by the formation of different types of charge - ordering ( co ) .",

    "et al._@xcite have shown that some of the dos very close to e@xmath13 get shifted to higher binding energies ( @xmath3 1.2 ev from e@xmath13 ) and consequently a co gap of @xmath3 100 mev opens up at the transition .",
    "these authors have remarked that such spectral weight transfer could be a generic feature of co gap in manganites .",
    "similar studies on the co compositions of pr@xmath0ca@xmath7mno@xmath2 are also reported@xcite .",
    "although , the mechanism of this co gap is still not clear , the large energy scale over which the spectral weight get transferred shows the possibility of coulombic origin . from the point of view of different theoretical models , it is quite likely that the pseudogap ( pg ) associated with the i m transitions , observed in double layered manganites by saitoh it et al.@xcite has the same origin as the co gap .",

    "5(a ) ) show little change in their near e@xmath13 spectral weight as a function of temperature , whereas the @xmath63 k and @xmath57 k spectra ( fig .",
    "5(c ) ) show a shift of spectral weight from the feature marked a `` to a as we go across the fmm - pmi transition .",
    "such a shift is visible between the @xmath46 k and @xmath57 k spectra ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) also . interestingly , the magnitude of the spectral weight shift between a '' to a remains the same for the @xmath63 k or @xmath46 k , showing that below t@xmath14 no further shift of spectral weight occurs with temperature .",
    "this shift of spectral weight from a `` to a while going across the fmm to pmi state shows the opening up of a gap at t@xmath14 .",
    "since , the pmi state also shows a finite amount of states at the e@xmath13 , we prefer to call this a pg . from the difference spectra shown in the lower panels",
    "it is clear that this pg occurs due to the shift of states over an energy scale @xmath3 @xmath28 ev .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 @xmath28 ev ( difference between a and a '' ) is required for the delocalization of the charge carriers to form the fmm state from the localized insulating state in this system .",
    "now , looking back at fig .",
    "3 will reveal that the energy position of a is the same as that of the spectral bump shown by the parent compound ( prmno@xmath2 ) at @xmath3 @xmath67 ev below e@xmath13 , which corresponds to the localized @xmath9 states in this insulator .",
    "when the charge carrier concentration , @xmath32 is increased to @xmath68 these localized @xmath9 states melt to the position of a \" due to the changes in the overlap of mn @xmath38 - o @xmath42 orbitals , as a consequence of the structural changes ( mn - o - mn bond angles ) . this delocalization becomes stronger below t@xmath14 resulting in the metallic behavior of @xmath61 sample .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "there have been a few studies using pes on the co gap in similar systems@xcite .",
    "although , none of our pr@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 samples show any co at any temperature , the energy scale involved in the shift of states from a to a `` in our spectra is comparable to the value ( @xmath67 ev ) observed in a co composition@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the pg observed here and the co gap are similar in nature , suggesting a common origin for both . as we have seen in the fig .",
    "5 the spectral weight shift in the pr@xmath55sr@xmath56mno@xmath2 sample from a to a '' across the t@xmath14 ( @xmath57 k to @xmath63 k ) remains the same even with cooling down to @xmath46 k. this shows there is no further temperature dependent delocalization of charge carriers except at the t@xmath14 .",
    "again , this is another similarity between the co gap and the pg , that both are abrupt at t@xmath14 with no temperature dependencies above or below@xcite .",
    "these similarities may further suggest that a delocalization of the charge carriers and thereby a shift of the near e@xmath13 dos is generic to the i m transitions in these manganites , regardless of the presence or absence of any co.    the shift of electron states from near e@xmath13 to the energies above it , is an important result in understanding the cmr effect .",
    "moreo _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that such pg can well be accounted in models based on electronic phase separation@xcite . in these models , the pg behavior was found to be robust in systems with mixed - phase characteristics , where fmm clusters exist in an insulating background .",
    "the abrupt nature of the pg at t@xmath14 found in our study also can be understood , since these mixed phase tendencies are strong at temperatures around t@xmath14 .",
    "signatures of mixed phases are visible even at temperatures above or below the t@xmath14 , in the form of the absence of a sharp fermi edge even in fmm phases and the existence of a finite number of states at the e@xmath13 in the pmi state .",
    "monte carlo calculations@xcite predict that the pg at the chemical potential should be generic of mixed phases .",
    "our studies using uv photoelectron spectroscopy show that the shifts of dos near the e@xmath13 observed across the i m transitions in compositions of the pr@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 system with no co , are abrupt at the t@xmath14 and occur over an energy scale of @xmath3 @xmath4 ev .",
    "the energy scale involved in this pg formation and the abrupt nature of it near the t@xmath14 , strongly suggest that the co gap observed earlier in other manganites and the pg may indeed have same origin .",
    "further , we infer from our results as well as the results shown by chainani _",
    "et al._@xcite and saitoh _",
    "et al._@xcite that such shifts of the near e@xmath13 dos could be generic to the i m transitions in the cmr compounds , regardless of the presence or absence of any charge ordering .",
    "the pg observed associated with the i m transition in pr@xmath55sr@xmath56mno@xmath2 , shows the delocalization of the charge carriers involved .",
    "our results could be understood within the framework of models based on the electronic phase separation where it has been shown that the pg is a common behavior of cmr compositions with mixed - phase character .",
    "our theoretical band structure calculations using lsda + u method on pr@xmath5sr@xmath6mno@xmath2 , which is close in character to the @xmath61 sample , show the possible existence of half - metallicity in this system ."
