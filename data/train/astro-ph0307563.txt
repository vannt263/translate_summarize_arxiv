    "the  forest observed in the spectra of qsos is the principal tool to study the evolution of the intergalactic medium .",
    "our present understanding of the  forest is based on the assumption that the intergalactic medium is photoionized , and that the absorption features arise from variations in gas density determined by the gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations .",
    "numerical realizations of cold dark matter models that are supported by independent observational evidence from the cosmic microwave background , galaxy clustering , and weak lensing make predictions for properties such as the distribution of the transmitted flux , the power spectrum , and the transverse sizes of the absorbers that are in broad agreement with observations ( e.g. , rauch 1998 ; crotts & fang 1998 ; mcdonald 2000 ; croft 2002 ; tegmark & zaldarriaga 2002 ) .    a fundamental quantity for the  forest is the intensity of the ionizing background as a function of redshift , which determines the degree of ionization of the intergalactic medium .",
    "one method for measuring this intensity is the proximity effect , which consists of a decline in the strength of the  absorption as the redshift of the qso is approached , compared to the strength observed at the same redshift in other lines of sight of qsos with a higher emission redshift .",
    "the effect can be interpreted as due to the additional ionization caused by the qso in its vicinity ; the total ionizing radiation is increased near the qso , reducing the neutral fraction in the absorption systems and decreasing their column density ( carswell 1982 ; murdoch 1986 ; bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ; scott 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , the effect can be used to measure the background intensity : the more intense the background is , the smaller the proximity effect we expect at a fixed distance from the qso , because the qso flux ( known from its luminosity ) is less important compared to the mean background .",
    "the most recent measurement by scott ( 2000 ) yields a value of the photoionization rate of @xmath3 , with an error of about 50% , over the redshift range @xmath4 .",
    "this interpretation of the proximity effect to measure the ionizing background intensity is , however , subject to several systematic uncertainties : ( a ) systematic errors in the redshift of the qso estimated from its emission lines may change the distances inferred from the absorption systems to the qso .",
    "scott show that the redshifts inferred from the oiii and mgii emission lines are higher by @xmath5 than the redshift obtained from the emission line , resulting in a factor of 2 decrease in the inferred background intensity .",
    "( b ) qsos could be variable on the photoionization timescale of @xmath6 years , and the proximity effect reflects the qso luminosity averaged over a photoionization timescale , which would be systematically lower than the present luminosity because qsos in a flux - limited sample should be preferentially selected in their bright phase .",
    "( c ) some qsos may be gravitationally lensed , again making them appear on average more luminous than they really are in a flux - limited sample .",
    "( d ) qsos are likely associated with dense regions in the universe , and the higher gas density in their vicinity may partially compensate for the decrease in the neutral fraction due to their ionizing flux .",
    "in fact , in the context of the  forest theory based on primordial fluctuations , the value of the ionizing background intensity can be determined from the observed transmitted flux distribution , once the mean baryon density , gas temperature and power spectrum amplitude are known , because numerical simulations allow one to predict the density and temperature distribution of the gas in the  forest .",
    "this method yields a value of the ionizing background intensity that is lower than that found from the proximity effect by a factor of 2 to 3 ( e.g. , mcdonald & miralda - escud 2001 ; schirber & bullock 2003 ) .",
    "several authors have searched for the transverse proximity effect in the past , starting with crotts ( 1989 ) , who observed a triplet of qsos at @xmath7 with separations of 2 to 3 arc minutes , corresponding to time - delays of a @xmath8 years .",
    "no convincing evidence was found for the proximity effect in this and later observations ( mller & kjrgaard 1992 ; fernndez - soto 1995 ; liske & williger 2001 ) . one exception is the case of q0302 - 003 , where a void of absorption lines was found by dobrzycki & bechtold ( 1991 ) in the vicinity of a qso ; however , the center of the void is offset by @xmath9 to the blue of the qso , which corresponds to a surprisingly large separation of @xmath10 proper mpc .",
    "these analyses , with detections and otherwise , have been based on taking some measure of the absorption in the region where the proximity effect is expected , and comparing this to an empirical model of absorption systems derived from other qso line of sights .",
    "most often the absorption has been characterized by the number of  lines with fitted voigt profiles that are found per unit redshift .",
    "a different approach was used by mller & kjrgaard and liske & williger : they measured the mean transmitted flux distribution in the proximity effect region and compared it to a modeled transmitted flux distribution , derived by assuming that the  forest consists of uncorrelated absorption lines with a distribution of column densities and doppler parameters obtained from fits to the observed spectra . in this paper , we use the full transmitted flux distribution as a probe to the transverse proximity effect , comparing it instead to the expected distribution obtained from artificial absorption spectra generated from cosmological simulations of the  forest .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of three qso pairs found in the sloan digital sky survey early data release , which are close enough for the expected transverse proximity effect to be important .",
    "the sample selection and continuum fitting of the spectra is described in  2 .",
    "the method we use to estimate the probability of observing a certain value of the transmitted flux in the spectrum , with the use of  forest simulations , is described in  3 . by comparing the actual spectra to simulated lines of sight ,",
    "we show in  4 that there is no evidence for the transverse proximity effect in our three pairs .",
    "we then model the possible effect of a density enhancement in the vicinity of the qsos (  5 ) , and discuss the effects of anisotropy (  6 ) and qso variability (  7 ) .",
    "we assume the flat cosmological model with present matter density @xmath11 and hubble constant @xmath12 throughout the paper .",
    "the sdss early data release contains a total of 3814 qsos with redshifts between 0.15 and 5.03 , and magnitudes @xmath13 ( schneider 2002 ) .",
    "we first took from these the 482 qsos with @xmath14 , on which the  forest spectrum is ( at least partly ) in the observed wavelength range . for each qso we searched for the closest neighbor in angular separation , and selected those pairs for which the foreground and background qso redshifts , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , satisfied @xmath17 , to ensure that the proximity effect region",

    "our power spectrum has @xmath98 [ where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the power spectrum ] .",
    "thus , our power spectrum amplitude is on the low side of present estimates ( note that seljak , mcdonald , & makarov 2003 find that the power spectrum amplitude may be higher than found by croft et al .  )",
    ". a lower amplitude of the power spectrum implies that there is more gas left in voids , hence providing more absorption over most regions in the  spectrum .",
    "this means that to obtain the same mean transmitted flux , we require a _ higher _ value of the background photoionization rate , @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the gas temperature we assume is on the low side of the observational determinations ( theuns 2002 and references therein ) , and a lower temperature also leads to a higher photoionization rate because of the increased recombination coefficient .",
    "hence our value of @xmath20 is actually an upper limit inferred from the mean transmitted flux , giving a lower limit for @xmath101 , and therefore making our predicted proximity effect conservatively low .",
    "we also show in [ fig : gamma_eff ] the measurement of @xmath20 by scott ( 2000 ) from the line - of - sight proximity effect . this value is higher than our estimate by a factor of at least @xmath102 at high redshift .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction there are several possible systematic errors in this measurement , in particular the effect of the gas overdensity near the qsos ; see  5 below .      once we have chosen the background , we can generate simulated spectra with and without the effect of the foreground qso . but",
    "before comparing these to the sloan spectra , we have to match the resolution , pixel size , and signal - to - noise of the data .",
    "we first smooth each line of sight in the simulation separately with the average resolution quoted in schneider ( 2002 ) : @xmath103 .",
    "we then adjust the pixel size in the simulation to match the pixel size of the sloan spectra , which is @xmath104 .",
    "the pixel size of the simulation corresponds to a velocity range of @xmath105 , so we simply average the flux over @xmath106 pixels . finally , we add noise to the simulated spectra by adding to the transmitted flux a random number selected from a gaussian distribution centered at zero with width equal to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the noise supplied for each sloan spectrum , and @xmath109 is our continuum fit .",
    "once we have smoothed , rebinned , and added noise to our simulated spectra , we are ready to compare them to the real spectra . we make this comparison with two sets of simulated spectra : one with the background ionization rate only ( `` quasar off '' ) , and the other with the additional ionization rate due to the foreground qso ( `` quasar on '' ) . to test the presence of the transverse proximity effect , we plot in [ fig : fnp_215 ] , [ fig : fnp_414 ] , and [ fig : fnp_334 ] , for each one of our three qso pairs , the fraction @xmath110 of simulated spectra in which the transmitted flux is below the measured value in the observed spectrum .",
    "if the modeling is correct , then half of the simulated spectra should have a transmitted flux below the measured one . in these plots",
    ", we have averaged the observed spectra over 5 pixels , corresponding to @xmath111 . at this velocity separation ,",
    "the  forest correlation function is small and so the transmitted flux values in adjacent pixels are close to independent .",
    "far from the redshift of the foreground qsos , the probabilities @xmath110 are in fact not far from uniformly distributed .",
    "but in the vicinity of the foreground qsos , the fraction of `` quasar on '' spectra below the observed spectrum is very small for all three pairs . in other words",
    ", the evidence shows that the transverse proximity effect is absent in all three cases .",
    "there is no large reduction in absorption observed at the redshift of the foreground qso as would be expected from the increased ionizing flux predicted in [ fig : g_n_w ] . indeed , there is actually strong  absorption in the vicinity of the foreground qso in pairs 1 and 3 , and about average transmission in pair 2 .",
    "one concern is that the measured redshifts of the foreground qsos may suffer from the same systematic uncertainties that plague the line - of - sight proximity effect .",
    "however , the sdss redshifts do not depend on a single emission line but instead are determined by cross - correlating the continuum - subtracted spectra ( see stoughton 2002 ) with the composite spectrum from vanden berk ( 2001 ) . for reference ,",
    "the foreground qso reshifts of pair 1 , 2 , 3 have , respectively , errors of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "since these errors correspond to less than two pixels in the spectra , we will neglect them in the rest of the analysis .",
    "even if these errors were underestimated , our visual inspection of the spectra suggests that the errors can not be large enough to change our conclusions on the transverse proximity effect , which should be detectable over several thousands of km / s .",
    "before we proceed to discuss the possible explanations for the absence of the proximity effect , we must address a caveat with our estimate of the probability , @xmath110 , that the transmitted flux is below the observed value , based on simulations of the  forest spectra . in the presence of the additional ionizing flux from the foreground qso",
    ", any optically thick absorption line will require an absorber with a high enough column density such that , even after dividing it by the factor @xmath115 ( in [ fig : g_n_w ] ) , the absorber still produces the low observed transmission .",
    "for example , to get the saturated absorption we see in [ fig : fnp_215 ] for pair 1 , where we have averaged over 5 pixels , would require a column density of @xmath116 ( assuming a minimum  optical depth of 3 over the velocity width : @xmath117 ) .",
    "but if the ionizing flux has been increased by a factor @xmath115 due to the proximity of a qso , the absorber must have had a minimum column density @xmath118 before the qso turned on .",
    "however , we know that the abundance of absorbers with this high column density is underestimated by a factor of 3 to 10 in simulations similar to the one used here , because of the limited spatial and mass resolution ( miralda - escud 1996 ; see also gardner 1997 , 2001 for a detailed study of lyman limit systems in simulations of different models and the effect of resolution )",
    ". the probability of finding strong absorption in the simulations may therefore be too low , particularly when the flux of the foreground qso is taken into account . nevertheless , the probability @xmath110 in the pixels near the foreground qso redshift is sufficiently small , especially in pair 1 , that correcting for this would not change the high improbability that a sufficiently strong absorber just happens to be in the vicinity of the foreground qso .",
    "furthermore , the high column density absorber required to produce the  absorption at the redshift of the foreground qso in the case of pair 1 would also need to have an unusually high velocity dispersion . in [ fig : prob_tran_comp ] , @xmath110 is replotted for the three pairs with the original pixel size ( i.e. , without averaging over 5 pixels ) . for pair 1",
    ", the low probability of the observed  flux after the qso ionization is taken into account ( solid line ) is spread over a wide velocity range of @xmath119 .",
    "this very large velocity spread is rare among high column density systems ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) , and when very high velocity dispersions occur ( e.g. , bahcall 1996 ) , the hydrogen column density tends to be concentrated on narrow subcomponents . [",
    "fig : a_v_bl_215 ] shows the detailed sdss spectrum of the , ly@xmath18 , and lyman limit absorption spectrum in pair 1 , at the redshift of the foreground qso .",
    "we see that despite the broad  absorption line , there is no discernible lyman limit absorption , and ly@xmath18 absorption only shows two narrow subcomponents .",
    "this shows that the absorption does not arise from a few highly dense clumps in a lyman limit system , but from gas that is well spread over the @xmath120 velocity range .",
    "in fact , to have saturated  absorption over this velocity range requires a minimum column density of @xmath121 , but the total column density can not be larger than @xmath122 due to the absence of lyman limit absorption .",
    "this suggests that the absorption system is due to gas distributed over a region comparable in size to the impact parameter to the qso .",
    "such a large region should have been well resolved in our simulations .",
    "for pairs 2 and 3 , the absorption is less strong and the factor @xmath115 is smaller , so the possibility of a coincident lyman limit system is not as unlikely as in pair 1 .",
    "we have also searched for lyman limit absorption in pair 2 , and there is none , so the strong absorption lines in pair 2 near the foreground qso must have a total column density below @xmath123 ( for pair 3 , the low redshift of the foreground qso puts the lyman limit outside the sdss spectrum wavelength range ) .",
    "the fact that the transverse proximity effect is absent in all three of our pairs essentially rules out that the absorption is caused by random lyman limit systems unrelated to the foreground qsos , even if the probabilities @xmath110 obtained from our simulations were too low by a factor up to @xmath124 and if we ignore the additional difficulty of the high velocity dispersion required .",
    "the evidence shows that either the gas density is greatly enhanced out to distances of @xmath125 proper mpc from qsos , or the qso ionizing flux is suppressed because of variability and/or anisotropy of the emission .",
    "we have assumed as a starting point that the average gas density in the vicinity of the foreground qso is not different from the overall average density",
    ". there is , however , reason to believe that there is a density enhancement around both radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos from the galaxy - qso clustering that is observed ( see ellingson , green & yee 1991 ; hutchings 1995 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ; wold 2001 ; finn 2001 ) and has been modeled ( kauffman & haehnelt 2002 ) .",
    "this density enhancement would result in excess absorption , diminishing the signature of the proximity effect due to the ionizing radiation , which would lead to an _ over - estimate _ of the background ionization rate ( see [ fig : gamma_eff ] ) .",
    "pascarelle ( 2001 ) attempted to use the observed qso - galaxy correlation to correct the ionizing background intensity inferred from the proximity effect , but their conclusions depend on their assumption that all  lines originate in fixed gaseous halos around galaxies , and they neglected peculiar velocity effects .    a gas density enhancement",
    "would also be expected around lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "adelberger ( 2003 ) found that the mean transmitted flux decreases near an lbg , dropping from a mean value of @xmath126 at large distances to @xmath127 at @xmath128 proper mpc , at @xmath129 .",
    "( proper ) from lbgs , which they attribute to galactic wind effects , but this distance is much smaller than those probed by our qso pairs . ] using our simulations , we find that this decrease in mean transmitted flux corresponds to an increase in the optical depth by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "the optical depth in pair 1 is expected to decrease from the enhanced photoionization rate by a factor of @xmath131 at this separation , so if the gas density enhancement around lbgs and luminous qsos were the same , it could not explain the lack of a proximity effect in our data .",
    "nevertheless , qsos may generally inhabit more massive halos than do lbgs , placing them in dense environments of a larger scale .    without an appropriate empirical estimate of the gas clustering around qsos , we will attempt to model it analytically , following the calculations in loeb & eisenstein ( 1995 ) . as outlined in the appendix ,",

    "the three panels assume that the qso is in the center of a halo with mass of ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) @xmath150 , with the mean density profile of [ fig : od_compare ] .",

    "similar mass estimates can be made for the foreground qso in pair 2 ( @xmath160 ) and pair 3 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "if we assume the typical black hole to bulge mass ratio of 0.13% ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) and assume the bulge to halo mass ratio is of order the baryon fraction ( @xmath162 ) , then we obtain a halo mass , @xmath163 , of roughly @xmath152 .    the surface density of halos per unit redshift has been plotted in [ fig : all_halos ] using the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) . at the redshift of pair 1 ( @xmath164 ) , there are ( 1000 , 10 , 0.001 ) halos per @xmath165 with ( @xmath149 , @xmath148 , @xmath147 ) @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "we can compare this to the 0.2 qsos per @xmath165 in the early data release at the same redshift . and 91 with @xmath166 over a field of @xmath167 .",
    "] this means that it is highly unlikely that the foreground qso in pair 1 may reside in a @xmath153 halo .",
    "however , the overdensity around smaller mass halos is apparently not sufficient to offset the purported flux from the foreground qso . as shown in [ fig : w_w ] , the effect of clustering is too small to eliminate the effect of the extra radiation in pair 1 except for the region between the caustics , with a width of only @xmath168 even for the case @xmath169 . for a @xmath152 halo ( a more likely mass given the halo abundances ) ,",
    "the region between caustics has practically disappeared and the optical depth should still be decreased by a factor of 5 to 10 over most of the region in which excess absorption is observed ( @xmath170 in [ fig : prob_tran_comp ] ) .    for the other two pairs , we have plotted the clustering / radiation ratio in [ fig : w_w_23 ] , assuming a @xmath171 halo . in the case of pair 2",
    ", the clustering again appears to be insufficient for offsetting the ionizing flux from the foreground qso . as for pair 3",
    ", it is possible that the reduced absorption that we expected from the transverse proximity effect has been mitigated by the enhanced density around the foreground qso .",
    "however , it might remain difficult to explain the wide absorption feature seen in [ fig : prob_tran_comp ] at @xmath172 if indeed the expected excess radiation is impinging on that region of the igm . in any case , clustering by itself appears to be unable to account for the lack of a transverse proximity effect in all three pairs .",
    "the alternatives , which we address in the next sections , are qso variability and anisotropy .",
    "a different possibility to explain the lack of a transverse proximity effect is that the emission from qsos is highly anisotropic . in any flux limited survey , the observed qsos",
    "would be preferentially observed along directions in which they appear particularly bright , and their flux seen along other directions could be much lower .",
    "the angle , @xmath173 , that a given redshift separation corresponds to is plotted in the top two panels of [ fig : phi_n_t ] . in the case of pair 1",
    ", the qso flux would have to be obscured from roughly @xmath174 to @xmath175 to explain the low probability region between @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "if we assume that this obscuration is symmetric around an axis , then the half - opening angle would only be @xmath178 . as shown in [ fig : phi_n_t ] , peculiar velocities would have a only a small effect on this angle . for pairs 2 and 3 , a wider half - opening angle ( @xmath179 ) is allowed because of the larger impact parameter and the lower velocity range in the spectrum in which the probability @xmath110 is very low .    a beam radius as small as @xmath180 for the qso radiation seems implausible . in unified models of agn ,",
    "the continuum ionizing radiation is supposed to come from the accretion disk , which may be absorbed by an obscuring torus near the equator , but typical half - opening angles are @xmath181 ( antonucci 1993 ; schmitt 2001 ) , and they are thought to increase with luminosity ( rudge & raine 2000 ) .",
    "a separate possibility is that the qso has not ionized the gas in its host halo , and that the ionizing radiation is able to escape only along a narrow tunnel among clouds .",
    "however , the fact that most qsos of luminosity similar to the foreground one in pair 1 do not exhibit intrinsic lyman limit absorption in their spectrum implies that this explanation could not account for a narrow beam of emission in most qsos .    to summarize , beaming of the ionizing radiation might be one of the reasons for the absence of the transverse proximity effect in our three pairs , but if this absence is generally confirmed on a larger sample of pairs , then beaming alone can not be the sole explanation .",
    "the final effect we consider is the possibility that the qso flux is variable .",
    "there is a time delay between the emission of the qso flux that we observe at present and the emission of the qso flux that illuminated the hydrogen in the spectrum of the background qso , given by @xmath182 , where @xmath57 and @xmath143 are defined in ( [ eq : r_f ] ) and ( [ eq : r_ll ] ) .",
    "the time - delay is plotted in the bottom two panels of [ fig : phi_n_t ] for all three pairs .",
    "the dotted curve shows the effect of including peculiar velocities when the foreground qso in pair 1 is in a halo of mass @xmath152 .",
    "we again focus on the region @xmath170 in pair 1 where the probability @xmath110 is lowest . if the lack of a proximity effect were due to the time - delay only",
    ", we find by comparing [ fig : g_n_w ] and [ fig : phi_n_t ] that the qso luminosity would need to have been @xmath183 times lower than now at a time @xmath184 years ago , and 50 to 100 times lower than now over the period from @xmath1 to @xmath2 years ago . in the case of pairs 2 and 3 ,",
    "the qsos would have to be shining an order of magnitude less bright from @xmath185 to @xmath2 years ago .",
    "these required variations in the luminosities would be smaller if significant clustering existed around the qso ( [ fig : w_w ] and [ fig : w_w_23 ] ) .",
    "there are other measurements related to the proximity effect that are sensitive to the time interval over which qsos maintain their luminosity .",
    "the existence of the line - of - sight proximity effect requires that the qsos shine continuously for a photoionization timescale , which is @xmath186 years for the measured ionizing background intensity ( see the introduction ) . the case of q0302 - 003 , and",
    "its  void associated with another nearby qso , analyzed by dobrzycki & bechtold ( 1991 ) , requires a lifetime longer than @xmath2 years if the void is really caused by the qso .",
    "the same qso , q0302 - 003 , was observed in the  spectrum by jakobsen ( 2003 ) , who found a gap in the absorption associated with another qso near the line of sight .",
    "the required qso lifetime is also @xmath2 years if the qso is responsible for the gap .",
    "the large  region around a z=6.28 qso also requires a lifetime longer than @xmath2 years if it was entirely ionized by the qso ( pentericci 2002 ; haiman & cen 2002 ) .",
    "we point out here another argument that shows that many luminous qsos must sustain their luminosities for periods of at least @xmath2 years . of the four qsos on which the  intergalactic absorption has been observed ,",
    "two show a strong line of sight proximity effect : q0302 - 003 , and pks1935 ( anderson 1999 , heap 2000 ) .",
    "the observed flux of these qsos of @xmath187 implies a photon luminosity of @xmath188 in photons that can ionize  ( i.e. , with energy greater than 54 ev ) .",
    "the size of the proximity effect in the spectra of these two qsos is @xmath189 , or a proper distance of 20 mpc . with this luminosity and at this distance",
    ", the photoionization rate on  ions that is obtained is @xmath190 .",
    "if the qso had been shining for a time less than @xmath2 years , it could not have ionized the region in which the proximity effect is observed to the level implied by its luminosity ( see anderson 1999 ) .",
    "we note that this argument does not require the assumption that the qso _",
    "ionized _ the entire region , but only that the qso has maintained its ionization over the last photoionization timescale .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that one must distinguish between the total length of time during which a black hole is producing a certain luminosity as it accretes , and the continuous time interval over which a qso maintains its luminosity .",
    "qsos might have repeated episodes of high luminosity , each one relatively short and separated by intervals of lower luminosity , which could add up to a longer total time of emission .",
    "several papers ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; barger 2001 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; haehnelt 2003 ) have shown that the total mass density of nuclear black holes in the universe is comparable to the mass density inferred from the radiation background from qsos ( soltan 1982 ) , for an assumed radiative efficiency of the accreted matter : @xmath191 .",
    "this also implies that , if qsos generally emit near the eddington luminosity , @xmath192 , then their total time of emission is @xmath193 years .",
    "measurements based on the amplitude of qso clustering and the assumption that qsos are located in massive halos ( martini & weinberg 2001 ; martini 2003 ) also measure this total time of emission .    in conclusion , we have found that although the time - delay effect can explain the absence of the proximity effect , it requires the foreground qso in pair 1 to be younger than @xmath1 years , and the lifetime should be @xmath194 years for pairs 2 and 3 ( owing to their larger impact parameters ) . at the same time , there is evidence that other qsos have sustained their luminosities for much longer times . therefore , time - delays can only eliminate the transverse proximity effect in some qsos if there is a wide range of variation in the time intervals over which qsos remain at a high luminosity .",
    "we have found three sets of sdss qso pairs in which we expected to see evidence for the transverse proximity effect .",
    "the fact that we do not implies that either the gas density along the line of sight is much higher than average , or the ionizing flux expected from the observed qso is suppressed .",
    "although it is likely that the high - redshift , luminous qsos are located near the center of the most massive halos that exist at the time when they are observed , we have found that the gas density enhancement is not sufficient to fully compensate for the increased ionizing intensity from the qso . for reasonable halo masses that are consistent with the abundance of qsos ,",
    "the impact parameters in our qso pairs are similar or larger than the radius around the halo where gas is just turning around , and the overdensity is not large .",
    "this suggests that there must also be a reduction of the qso flux , either due to anisotropic emission or to a lower luminosity of the qso in the past @xmath195 to @xmath2 years .",
    "each one of these two explanations also has problems to account for the absence of a transverse proximity effect in three pairs by itself : anisotropy requires a very small opening angle , and variability implies a large reduction of the luminosity over a timescale over which other qsos are known to have remained highly luminous ( jakobsen 2003 ) .",
    "the combination of the three effects ( high gas density around the qsos , anisotropy and variability ) can probably more easily account for the observed  excess absorption near the foreground qsos , rather than the excess transmission that was expected .",
    "previous studies have also generally found no evidence for the transverse proximity effect .",
    "crotts & fang ( 1998 ) found , just as we do , excess  absorption compared to the mean transmitted flux in the region of the proximity effect .",
    "mller & kjrgaard ( 1992 ) concluded from an analysis of one pair and the triplet of qsos from crotts ( 1989 ) that the transverse flux from local qsos had to be reduced by a factor of at least @xmath196 for an assumed background photoionization rate @xmath197 .",
    "for our lower assumed values of @xmath20 ( [ fig : gamma_eff ] ) , this corresponds to a reduction factor @xmath198 .",
    "fernndez - soto ( 1995 ) detected in 3 pairs a weak transverse proximity effect that was consistent with a high value of the background ionization rate , @xmath199 . assuming this rate is an order of magnitude too large",
    ", we can interpret the small observed effect as due to a reduction in the transverse flux by a factor of @xmath200 . to express our results in terms of a reduction factor",
    ", we can assume that the probability @xmath110 for all points in [ fig : prob_tran_comp ] should , minimally , be greater than 0.001 . to obtain this , we find the transverse flux in pair 1 must be less than 0.07 times the expected isotropic value .",
    "the fact that many of the closest pairs in the literature exhibit at least a 10% reduction in the transverse flux considerably strengthens our conclusion .",
    "future progress in understanding the proximity effect should come from a reanalysis of the line - of - sight proximity effect in a large sample of qsos .",
    "an enhanced gas density near qsos should equally impact the proximity effect on the line of sight , and although its strength is complicated by the effect of peculiar velocities this can be modeled in simulations .",
    "the environment of qsos can be probed not only from the average proximity effect , but also from its scatter .",
    "it is well known that the value of the ionizing background intensity inferred from the proximity effect varies widely from one qso to another , implying that a large sample must be used ; however , this scatter is probably not explained by the  absorption variance in random regions of the intergalactic medium , and the effect of the qso environment is likely to be important .",
    "a thorough investigation of the line - of - sight proximity effect should help in disentangling the effects of gas density and the reduction of the qso flux in the transverse proximity effect .",
    "the effects of anisotropy and variability can hopefully also be separated , once a large number of pairs over a range of angular separations are available .",
    "the flux reduction due to anisotropy should depend only on the angle @xmath173 ( see  6 ) and not the distance to the qso , and should be symmetric when changing @xmath173 to @xmath201 ( except if the two qso `` beams '' are often of different luminosity ) , whereas the mean reduction due to variability should be a monotonically increasing function of time delay .",
    "there is a promising potential in the transverse proximity effect for learning on the environment , anisotropy , and variability of qsos .",

    "<S> the transverse proximity effect is the expected decrease in the strength of the  forest absorption in a qso spectrum when another qso lying close to the line of sight enhances the photoionization rate above that due to the average cosmic ionizing background . </S>",

    "<S> variability demands that the luminosity of the qso with the largest predicted effect was much lower @xmath1 years ago , whereas the transverse proximity effect observed in the  absorption in qso 0302 - 003 by jakobsen ( 2003 ) implies a lifetime longer than @xmath2 years . </S>",
