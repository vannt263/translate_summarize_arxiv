    "the concept of a resonance is pervasive in quantum physics as applied e.g.  on nuclear , particle , atomic and molecular phenomena .",
    "however , a closer look at the literature shows that there is no unique way of defining a resonance . when applied in data analysis , varying definitions can give different results for broad resonances @xcite or may even at some point become impossible to apply .",
    "there are two distinct aspects of a resonance , the first being as a state of a ( continuum ) system in analogy with a bound state , the second as characterizing an enhanced response to a disturbance .",
    "we shall here mainly be concerned with the first aspect .",
    "we shall focus in this paper on beta - delayed particle emission processes that traditionally are considered to proceed through ( resonance ) states in the beta - decay daughter and shall argue that beta - decays directly to the continuum should be taken into account in more situations than done so far . before dealing specifically with beta - decay we shall in section 2 remind the reader about some aspects of the description of resonances and how well they perform when applied to broad resonances .",
    "this will be illustrated in section 3 through simple model calculations .",
    "one goal is to clarify whether parameters taken from analyses of beta - decay data can be used in modelling of other nuclear processes proceeding through the same `` reaction channels '' , we show in section 4 that loosely bound initial states may require special considerations . in the limit of very broad resonances",
    "it is not possible to decouple the population of the resonance from its decay",
    ". the properties of the resonance , its position and width ( or more generally its shape ) , will differ when populated via different mechanisms . since analyses of decays through broad levels are often made via r - matrix fits we shall discuss ( section 4.3 ) what effects may occur there .",
    "finally , section 5 discusses how our results may be generalized and section 6 presents our conclusion .",
    "it may be appropriate first to recall that a resonance as such does not correspond directly to any physical observable .",
    "however , the resonance concept can be very useful in describing the evolution of a system , e.g.  as a response to an external probe , namely by employing resonances as basis states in the description .",
    "we are of course never forced to use a specific set of basis states , but narrow resonances in particular seem a natural choice . in the opposite limit of very broad structures the alternative description in terms of `` pure '' continuum states ( a basis defined by the asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunctions ) may seem the natural one .",
    "it is important to note that both descriptions are valid and , at least for structures of intermediate width , can be used in practice .",
    "a practical example can be found in the calculation @xcite of the dipole strength function for @xmath2be where a basis combining resonances and continuum contributions is used and it is demonstrated explicitly how the number of included resonances can be varied without changing the result .",
    "( the complex scaling method @xcite used in this work can be related to the berggren decomposition of the continuum @xcite . )    from such general considerations it appears that it is to some extent a matter of convenience whether one interprets an experimental spectrum in terms of resonances or not .",
    "this point has been made very clearly by dalitz @xcite .",
    "the two possible descriptions , emphasizing resonances or continuum states , may be thought of as complementary , and the question of whether a process happens resonantly or not will as noted earlier @xcite not always have a unique , or meaningful , answer .",
    "nevertheless it is worthwhile to explore how far the resonance concept may be taken , to see how different resonance definitions relate to experimental observables , and to determine when corrections must be included .",
    "most resonance definitions are conceptual or formal , but do agree in the case of narrow resonances .",
    "resonances may also be identified in experimental spectra , and a standard requirement has been that several different observables should give consistent ( energy and width ) parameters for a given resonance , the point being that resonances should be an intrinsic property of the system studied and ideally not influenced by the ways of exciting it . for increasingly broader resonances the deduced parameters can no longer be expected to be identical for the different conceptual definitions or different observables .",
    "blatt and weisskopf @xcite start their exposition of nuclear resonances by considering the relative amplitude of wavefunctions inside and outside the nucleus .",
    "a resonance corresponds to an enhancement of the interior wavefunction and thereby to a spatial concentration .",
    "another possibility is to look at the time delay between incoming and outgoing wave packets that should be large , see eg.@xcite . that these two criteria are equivalent is shown by the discussion in @xcite on how the presence of an unstable state leads to localization .",
    "as @xmath3 ( the resonance width parameter ) increases these two ways of identifying resonances become less clear : the enhancement of the interior wavefunction for a given energy will decrease and the delay time ( lifetime ) will approach the transit time of the constituents across the nucleus .    it is well known that a state decaying exponentially in time will have an energy distribution given by a breit - wigner shape , but this distribution can also be derived in several other ways , see e.g. @xcite . for broad levels the pure breit - wigner shape has to be corrected ( energy distributions do not extend below zero energy , nor to arbitrarily high energies ) .",
    "furthermore it becomes harder to unambiguously interpret broad structures in energy spectra as ( distorted ) breit - wigner distributions since bumps in an energy distribution may occur for a number of other reasons @xcite .",
    "when following the evolution of a bound state as its energy is increased and crosses the threshold to the continuum , it is tempting to extend the eigenvalue description by employing complex energies and letting the state acquire an imaginary energy corresponding to half its width .",
    "one often in theoretical descriptions starts from complex eigenstates with purely outgoing waves , the gamow states @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to the description of resonances as poles ( at complex values ) in the s - matrix @xcite .",
    "this is the definition employed in most , but not all @xcite , treatments in mathematical physics .",
    "it leads to very elegant formulations , but also runs into problems for very broad states . on one hand , as pointed out by sitenko @xcite , the assumption of purely outgoing waves is no longer realistic when the time delay is very short . on the other hand ,",
    "as noted e.g.  in @xcite , we can easily identify poles close to the real axis in experimental data ( that are on the real axis ) , but as widths become larger and the poles move away from the real axis it becomes increasingly harder to make this identification . in practical situations",
    "one often has to introduce more than one state and thereby many parameters for the states to determine from the experimental spectrum , examples will be given in section [ sec : rmat ] .",
    "in the extreme situation there is `` more input from the theoretical skeleton than from the experimental data '' .",
    "see also @xcite for more ( and complementary ) accounts of the resonance phenomenon .",
    "the changes that occur as resonances become broader will be illustrated in a schematic model where the many nuclear degrees of freedom are restricted to the motion of a single neutron . the corresponding strong potential is taken to be a square well with radius @xmath4 fm and depth @xmath5 . for a positive energy @xmath6 ( for definiteness we shall take the reduced mass @xmath7 to be 10/11 of the neutron mass ) and an angular momentum @xmath8 the radial wavefunction , @xmath9 , inside the potential is proportional to @xmath10 where @xmath11 . outside the potential",
    "the radial wavefunction is normalized to be the linear combination @xmath12k$ ] of the regular and irregular spherical bessel function of order @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the phase shift that is found by matching the inner and outer wavefunction .",
    "the explicit factor of @xmath14 implies that the wavefunction is normalized to approach @xmath15 for large radii @xmath16 .",
    "we shall mainly consider p - waves , this is the simplest case where resonances occur since s - waves that have no confining potential form virtual states instead .",
    "this simple model will now be used to compare different resonance definitions .",
    "first of all , a phase shift that goes through @xmath17 is often used as a criterion .",
    "this is closely related to elastic scattering for which the cross section is @xmath18 the factor @xmath19 is clearly maximal when the phase shift equals @xmath20 .",
    "however , for broad levels the variation of the front factor @xmath21 shifts down the maximum for the cross section to lower energies . as a second way to define resonances",
    ", one may look at the enhancement of the interior wavefunction that can be quantified through the integral @xmath22 of the squared wavefunction over the potential range . if no potential is present , i.e.  the neutron is in an s - wave and @xmath23 mev , the integral averages to @xmath24 fm .",
    "figure [ fig : int_e1 ] shows the calculated elastic cross - section @xmath25 and the integral @xmath26 of the interior wavefunction as a function of energy for different choices of the potential depth @xmath27 just above 50 mev ( in this range there will be one bound state in the potential ) . as seen in the figure peaks",
    "occur as long as they are well below the height of the potential barrier .",
    "the peak shape of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 become wide and asymmetric as the peak positions increase , note that the peak positions and widths are quite similar in the two cases .",
    "there is still a broad structure visible in @xmath26 for @xmath28 mev , but a less clear signal in @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the positions where the phase shift goes through @xmath17 deviates more and more from the visual peak and the phase shift never reaches @xmath17 for potential depth 51.0 mev .",
    "the resonance positions according to these two definitions are given in table [ tab : eres ] in column two and four .",
    "the peak position for the integral @xmath26 is essentially identical to the position of the maximum of the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "the lower part of table [ tab : eres ] have potential depths corresponding to wavefunctions with no nodes inside the potential , for the upper part there is one node .      the numerical results shown above suggests that resonances should be characterized by being localized in space as well as peaked in energy , this seems natural for the case of short - ranged potentials considered in this paper .",
    "the implications of this point of view will be pursued in the following sections , but a few observations can be made already .",
    ".the position of a resonance for p - wave neutrons in a square well of radius 4 fm and depth @xmath27 according to four different definitions : the total or resonant phase shift , @xmath13 or @xmath29 , going through @xmath17 and the maxima of the elastic cross - section or the beta - strength distribution .",
    "all energies are in units of mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is interesting that the differences in the maximum of the distribution , @xmath30 , are seen as well in the extracted fit values for @xmath31 .",
    "the shift of @xmath30 relative to @xmath31 is close to that given by equation ( [ eq : eshift ] ) .",
    "however , the shape of the distributions necessitated the two component fits where in all cases the two r - matrix levels interfere destructively between the two level positions .",
    "the width parameters @xmath32 therefore do not correspond to the observed fwhm values and the beta strength parameters @xmath33 are lower than the maximum value of one .",
    "the parameters of the second level are poorly constrained by the data and the fit uncertainties therefore large .",
    "nevertheless , the parameters @xmath34 are in all cases unrealistically large , as is also the case for several values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the overall fit can therefore not be interpreted in terms of physically well - defined resonances , it rather resembles the situation encountered in the r - matrix fits @xcite to the decay of @xmath37n into states in @xmath37c above the alpha particle threshold where unphysical values of @xmath38 , @xmath3 and @xmath39 were obtained when a @xmath40 level was introduced in the fits ( this was done in order to reach an acceptable @xmath41-value ) .    adding more levels in the r - matrix fit may in principle",
    "lead to a more acceptable solution , but the extra parameters introduced as levels are added implies that it will not be possible to determine all parameters solely from the data .",
    "the contribution from the regions outside of the nuclear core that occur in beta decay for small initial binding energy can therefore be expected to give a difference in extracted resonance energy between analyses of beta decay and elastic scattering data . in our example",
    "this difference reached more than 10% of the width of the level .",
    "b is shown versus the channel radius used for the fit .",
    "the positions of the well established 3 mev level ( filled circle ) and the @xmath1 doublet close to 17 mev ( lines ) are stable whereas the position of the fourth level ( open circle ) varies . ]    to learn more about how r - matrix fits may be interpreted we turn to the example of the beta - delayed alpha decay of @xmath0b which has been studied on several occasions .",
    "we use the spectrum obtained recently in @xcite that also gives details on earlier work as well as a brief account of the fitting procedure and results for a fit with channel radius 4.5 fm .",
    "more details on the fit as well as results for other channel radii can be found in @xcite . to get an acceptable fit one needs to include ,",
    "apart from the well established level at 3 mev and the @xmath1 doublet at 16.6 mev and 16.9 mev , a fourth @xmath1 level , see figure [ fig : b8fit ] that shows the energy positions as function of channel radius .",
    "the nature of the extra level has been discussed on several occasions , see e.g.@xcite , with barker arguing from a simultaneous fit to scattering and decay data that it is an intruder state .",
    "however , not all r - matrix levels can be interpreted as resonances @xcite . for the case of @xmath0be a detailed demonstration of this",
    "was made for the s - wave resonances in a comparison @xcite of r - matrix and k - matrix fits .    in more general terms",
    "this was demonstrated already by wigner and eisenbud @xcite who showed how r - matrix theory treats even the case of vanishing interaction through an infinite number of levels @xmath42 with parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these levels can not be interpreted as resonances , but are needed in order to reproduce the case of `` no scattering '' .",
    "they do appear since the r - matrix levels form a complete set of basis functions .",
    "if , as is often the case , a small number of r - matrix levels is used in a fit one may find the need for a `` background level '' with unphysical energies or @xmath45-parameter , such a level effectively incorporates the effects of the above infinite number of levels , as illustrated in @xcite . turning this around , to incorporate continuum behaviour in an r - matrix fit one needs extra levels with large @xmath45 values and approximate distance @xmath46 ( the value for @xmath47 5 fm and @xmath48 is 8.25 mev for the alpha - alpha system and 18.0 mev for the neutron system above . ) the fourth level in figure [ fig : b8fit ] has a dependence on the channel radius @xmath49 that is consistent with this behaviour and indeed has quite large values of @xmath45 ( clearly larger than the ones for the 3 mev level , and therefore unphysical ) and may therefore function as an effective level .",
    "one would expect that introducing more levels in the fits would give better behaviour , in particular at large @xmath49 , but the alternative approach that interprets the need for such extra levels as a signature of a noticable direct contribution seems more attractive .",
    "that fits performed at large channel radii may need more levels is consistent with the general practice @xcite of using rather small values for the radii .    in summary",
    ", r - matrix theory has a complete basis and can reproduce any decay mechanism , also decays directly to continuum states .",
    "the presence of such decays can be indicated in several ways : by r - matrix levels that do not correspond to any physical `` bump '' in the spectra , by level energies that scale inversely as the channel radius squared , or by levels that have unphysically large values for the parameters that represent the coupling to different channels , like @xmath45 and @xmath39 .",
    "most beta - delayed neutron emissions will not proceed through states with single - particle neutron strength .",
    "the delta - shell potential introduced above to mimic this effect may not be sufficiently realistic , but the observed dependence on the initial state binding energy should remain and could in extreme cases give peak shifts approaching the width of the resonance .",
    "the mirror process is proton emission following @xmath50 decay .",
    "the coulomb barrier will now affect both initial and final proton states and diminish the contribution from distances beyond the nuclear potential .",
    "on the other hand more decay channels will be open , there is e.g.  beta - feeding to the ias for nuclei with more protons than neutrons .",
    "a special situation may be encountered for isospin 1 systems where ( in light nuclei ) the nuclei with isospin projection @xmath51 can both decay to the same states in the nucleus with projection @xmath52 .",
    "these mirror decays may now differ in line shape .",
    "two possible cases occur for isospin 3/2 systems : the beta decay of @xmath53o includes a transition to a level at 8.198 kev in @xmath53n that is more than 200kev wide , this is the mirror transition to the @xmath53b case considered earlier . the proton energy has only been measured in one experiment @xcite where a surprising energy shift 50 kev upwards with respect to reaction data was reported .",
    "a more careful investigation of this case seems needed .",
    "the beta decay of @xmath54ne includes a transition to a quite broad , 700(250 ) kev , 8.2 mev 3/2@xmath55 level @xcite but the energy of this resonance has not been measured precisely in any experiment",
    ".    the main remaining beta - delayed process to consider is beta - delayed alpha decay ( delayed emission of other particles , such as tritons , has also been observed , but only in rather few nuclei ) . for such transitions",
    "the overlap integrals will be more complex and simple models hardly adequate . nevertheless , there are , as alluded to above , experimental data that may point to related effects .",
    "consider first the decays of @xmath0b and @xmath0li into @xmath1 levels in @xmath0be that subsequently decay by breaking up into two alpha particles .",
    "as shown in the previous section the most natural explanation of the @xmath0b decay data is in terms of a contribution also from direct decays to continuum states .",
    "a detailed comparison of peak positions of the lowest @xmath1 resonance in the two decays and in alpha - alpha scattering performed in @xcite gave the same value within about 20 kev , but the beta strength is low in this case so the expected energy shift may be small .",
    "furthermore , the beta decay strength parameters for the two mirror decays differed in the analysis and it may be worthwhile to try to model the system rather than relying on r - matrix fits .    as the next example , consider decays leading to the alpha - particle cluster states in @xmath37c where the r - matrix fits mentioned above @xcite also strongly indicated the presence of decays directly to the continuum . here",
    "one is dealing with a three alpha particle final state which further complicates the theoretical treatment .",
    "existing cluster models @xcite may be a starting point for an analysis , but in order also to evaluate the overlap integrals that enter in the beta - decay process they have to be extended .    finally , the e1 component of the astrophysically important @xmath37c(@xmath56,@xmath45)@xmath57o reaction is often evaluated by combining reaction and beta decay data , see e.g.  @xcite . in the combined fit to data the resonance position and width is assumed to be the same for all processes . in view of our results this assumption should be checked",
    ".      it would be interesting to extend the calculations also to other ways of populating resonances in order to see how large difference may be there .",
    "a good starting point for transfer reactions could be the semiclassical model for transfer to continuum states by bonaccorso and brink @xcite .",
    "coupled channels calculations may also be used to treat inelastic scattering . for knockout reactions at higher beam energies there is already an extensive discussion on the reaction mechanism , see e.g.  @xcite where arguments for a dominance of direct transitions are presented .",
    "it was striking to see the rather large difference in spectral shape between elastic scattering and beta - decay that appeared for very wide structures ( to some extent even for s - wave systems ) , a difference that must arise from the fact that the initial state in beta decay is confined .",
    "this suggests that beta - decay is more sensitive to broad resonances than elastic scattering .",
    "it will be interesting to see how other experimental probes will behave and whether there will be similar effects of spatially extended nuclear states ( e.g.  the rather loosely bound deuteron often employed in transfer reactions ) .",
    "we have so far only considered allowed beta - decay . in higher orders , @xmath58 ,",
    "one encounters matrix elements that , similar to the case of electromagnetic interactions , involve spherical bessel functions @xmath59 ( or their generalization to take into account the effects of the nuclear coulomb field ) with a wave number @xmath60 in the relevant range for the transition @xcite .",
    "this will lead to an enhancement of direct transitions similar to that already mentioned for electromagnetic transitions .",
    "the same conclusion also holds for processes at somewhat higher energy , such as electron or neutrino scattering or muon capture @xcite , where the higher order processes become more important .      when calculating processes close to a threshold and employing a framework , such as the gamow shell model @xcite , that is sufficiently powerful to capture both bound state and continuum behaviour , results are sometimes described in terms of resonant and non - resonant continuum contributions .",
    "such a division is of course , as practitioners are well aware , only possible with a specific choice of which resonances are included ; the example of the calculation of the @xmath2be dipole strength function @xcite was quoted already .",
    "a distinction may be made within a theoretical model , but one can not find a general and unambiguous experimental way of separating resonant and non - resonant processes .",
    "this is well established ( see e.g.  appendix 3f in @xcite ) , but the above calculations illustrate this in a new way .",
    "the terms resonant and non - resonant continuum suggests that it is a property of the continuum , i.e.  of the final state on its own .",
    "the cases discussed above where the initial state structure influenced the detailed line shape shows that such an interpretation can lead to a rather complex description of actual processes . in a similar way",
    "radiative capture can in limiting cases be described as proceeding through resonant capture or direct capture , but will in general have contributions from both , and a general distinction between one reaction mechanism and the other can not be made . assuming as in section [ sec:2res ] that a resonance should be localized in configuration space as well as in energy ,",
    "one may use short - distance and large - distance contributions as ways of distinguishing resonant and continuum terms ; see e.g.  the explicit discussion in @xcite where cross terms also appeared , but note that the exact point of division is arbitrary .",
    "based on the picture of spatial division one would distinguish resonant and non - resonant contributions through their different radial contribution . this explains why operators with different radial weighting have different sensitivities to `` non - resonant '' contributions , with electromagnetic transitions being more prone to display a direct mechanism .",
    "except for situations where one of the two contributions dominate , a clear - cut division is not possible .",
    "the most important features of broad resonances and our main results may be summarized as follows :    * in the limit of broad resonances , different ways of defining a resonance will not have the same range of validity and will not give the same values for the resonance position and width .",
    "* beta - decay ( and to an even larger extent electromagnetic ) transitions may get contributions from extra - nuclear distances , this distorts the observed line shape .",
    "the effect can be naturally interpreted as a contribution from decays directly to continuum states . in general such contributions",
    "will increase in importance as one approaches the driplines , partly due to the low binding energies occuring there , partly due to the fact that more transitions with large beta strength will be seen .",
    "transitions with large beta strength are more likely to show an effect .",
    "* extraction of resonance parameters from data has to be done with care .",
    "the comparison of elastic scattering and beta - decay showed that r - matrix resonance parameters may depend on the process .",
    "r - matrix fits of continuum contributions require introduction of extra levels .",
    "such levels often have unphysical parameter values : energies that depend on the channel radius or too strong coupling parameters . *",
    "combining information from different types of experiments in order to narrow down the properties of a resonance can therefore go wrong for broad levels .",
    "a concrete example of this is the @xmath1 levels in @xmath0be discussed in section [ sec : rmat ] .",
    "conversely , using resonance parameters from one experiment in another seemingly resonance dominated process may not be appropriate .",
    "in such cases a more involved theoretical analysis must be done . *",
    "different experimental probes differ in their sensitivity to resonance structure , beta - decay may be more sensitive than other probes such as elastic scattering .",
    "this is due to the initial state in beta - decay being localized . * the levels that enter in r - matrix fits",
    "can not always be interpreted as resonances , the example discussed in detail involved the @xmath0b decay .",
    "our results were obtained mainly for continuum p - wave neutrons , but the more complex case of continuum s - waves was also considered briefly . the trends found should persist for other beta - delayed particle emission processes and related cases , and some of our findings may also be relevant outside of nuclear physics for other systems with short - range potentials situated close to a threshold .",

    "<S> beta - decay into broad resonances gives a distorted lineshape in the observed energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> part of the distortion arises from the phase space factor , but we show that the beta - decay matrix element may also contribute . based on a schematic model for p - wave continuum neutron states it is argued that beta - decay directly to the continuum should be considered as a possible contributing mechanism in many decays close to the driplines . the signatures in r - matrix fits for such decays </S>",
    "<S> directly to continuum states are discussed and illustrated through an analysis of the beta - decay of @xmath0b into @xmath1 states in @xmath0be . </S>"
