    "+ 180^. [ eq : phasetrans ] an example of this similarity can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : duality ] , in which we show the allowed regions for @xmath58 as a function of @xmath116 at dune for two cases : ( a ) the data are consistent with the sm and the nh with @xmath117 , and ( b ) the data are consistent with the sm and the ih with @xmath118 .",
    "we see that a shift of @xmath119 , renders the allowed regions between the two cases very similar ; the allowed regions of the nsi scenario with the ih ( nh ) in case ( a ) are similar to the allowed regions of the nsi scenario with the nh ( ih ) in case ( b ) after the phase transformation .",
    "this similarity can be understood as follows . in order to fit the sm data with an nsi scenario , the two main constraints from the appearance channel in both the neutrino and antineutrino modes are & p^_i(__e)- p^_j(__e)=0 , + & p^_i(|_|_e)-p^_j(|_|_e)=0 , where @xmath120 .",

    "( [ eq : nu ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : antinu ] ) so that we obtain the same two constraints on the nsi parameters .",
    "since the phase transformation does not depend on @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the allowed regions at dune , t2hk and t2hkk are similar for both hierarchies",
    ". however , note that if we take into account the higher order terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - prob ] ) , in particular the third and fifth lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - prob ] ) , the phase transformation does not leave the two constraints unchanged , which explains the small difference between the allowed regions in the two scenarios .",
    "there is a similar correspondence for any combination of hierarchies between the sm and nsi scenarios .",
    "because of the correspondence discussed above , we expect the nsi sensitivities to be similar whether the data are consistent with the sm in the nh or the sm in the ih .",
    "this can seen by comparing fig .",

    "[ fig:3eps - smih ] . in sum",
    ", the nsi sensitivities in a given experiment will be similar regardless of the true hierarchy , modulo the transformation @xmath123 .",
    "we find that the sensitivity of these experiments to @xmath56 is outside the range of our scan .",
    "after marginalizing over @xmath56 and the mass hierarchy , we show the @xmath115 sensitivities to @xmath57 at dune , t2hk and t2hkk in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt-2eps ] .",
    "we see that t2hkk-1.5 has better sensitivity than t2hkk-2.5 because of its higher energy spectrum and larger statistics .",
    "we also see that the @xmath115 sensitivity at dune becomes quite weak at some @xmath0 values .",
    "this is due to a degenerate region near the boundary of the ranges that we have scanned , which was first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt - delptap ] . since this degenerate region , which occurs because of",
    "a correlation between @xmath57 and the deviation of @xmath7 from maximal mixing , is at the boundary , we also show the 90% cl sensitivity curve at dune in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt-2eps ] to emphasize that the sensitivity is uniform if the degenerate region is resolved by future atmospheric data .",
    "we studied the sensitivities to nsi in the proposed next generation long - baseline neutrino experiments dune , t2hk and t2hkk . for the t2hk and t2hkk experiments",
    ", we adopted the new detector configurations and fluxes provided by the hyper - kamiokande collaboration .",
    "to understand the effect of each nsi parameter on the experimental performance , we considered different scenarios with different combinations of nsi parameters .",
    "we find that if only one of @xmath60 or @xmath61 is nonzero , most of the continuous four - fold degeneracies with nsi at a single @xmath74 and @xmath75 measurement can be resolved for the range of energies available at these experiments .",
    "the degeneracies are broken even further at t2hkk with two different baselines . however ,",
    "if multiple nsi are nonzero , these experiments can not measure the mass hierarchy , cp phase and @xmath7 octant as a result of degeneracies between nsi and sm parameters , and between nsi parameters . as a specific realization of the latter",
    ", we find that a cancellation between terms at leading order in the appearance channel probabilities when @xmath124 strongly affects the sensitivities to these two nsi parameters at t2hk and t2hkk . also , the sensitivities at all three experiments are worsened by the generalized mass hierarchy degeneracy in the nsi scenario .",
    "because the generalized mass hierarchy degeneracy occurs at the hamiltonian level , atmospheric neutrino and reactor neutrino experiments will not be able to resolve it .",
    "we also studied the dependence of the sensitivities on the true cp phase @xmath0 and the true mass hierarchy .",
    "we find that the sensitivities are much weaker for all values of @xmath0 when multiple nsi are nonzero .",
    "also , we find that due to leading order effects in the appearance channel probabilities , there is a similarity of the allowed regions for the nsi parameters between the case in which the data are consistent with the normal hierarchy and the case in which the data are consistent with the inverted hierarchy . thus the sensitivities are similar whether nature has chosen the nh or the ih , modulo the transformation @xmath125 .",
    "overall dune has the best sensitivity to the magnitude of the nsi parameters , while t2hkk has the best sensitivity to cp violation whether or not there are nsi , and overall t2hkk-1.5 does better than t2hkk-2.5 .",
    "we further studied the sensitivities to @xmath56 and @xmath57 that mainly come from the disappearance channel .",
    "we find that the sensitivities to @xmath56 are limited compared to atmospheric experiments , and we obtained the sensitivity to @xmath57 at these three experiments .",
