    "a well known problem in fluid mechanics is that of @xmath0 point vortices moving in the plane , which may be regarded as an approximation to more general vortex motion .",
    "this is commonly known as the _ @xmath0-vortex problem_. of particular interest are solutions that appear fixed when viewed in a uniformly rotating or translating frame .",
    "these are called _ relative equilibria _ and have been studied by many authors , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite.the focus of this paper is on relative equilibria of the planar @xmath0-vortex problem with @xmath5 where one vortex has large circulation and @xmath1 have small , equal circulation .",
    "we show that the weak vortices limit to a single circle about the strong central vortex as the small circulation tends to zero , and that the resulting configuration must be a critical point of a particular potential function depending only on the relative positions of the `` small '' vortices on this limiting circle .",
    "conversely , we find that nondegenerate critical points of this potential continue to relative equilibria with nonzero circulation , and the linear stability of these solutions is determined by the type of critical point of the limit potential .",
    "one case that has been carefully studied has the small vortices in an @xmath1-gon around the large vortex in the center .",
    "this family is a relative equilibrium of the problem regardless of the relative strengths of the central and surrounding vortices .",
    "its stability has been studied in detail by cabral and schmidt in @xcite . in particular",
    ", they showed that the @xmath1-gon around a central vortex is unstable when the circulation of the surrounding vortices is sufficiently small .",
    "a new proof of this is presented here and these techniques imply the existence of two more families of critical points of the limit potential .",
    "one of these other families continues to a linearly stable class of relative equilibria of the full problem whenever it is nondegenerate .",
    "members of this class of configurations have weak and strong vortices of the same sign.the methods used here are parallel to those used to study relative equilibria of the @xmath6-body problem with newtonian inverse square force of attraction in celestial mechanics .",
    "the results for vortices are , surprisingly , very different . for the celestial mechanics problem ,",
    "the relative equilibrium formed by an @xmath1-gon of small masses about a large central mass is stable for @xmath4 and is the only relative equilibrium for @xmath1 sufficiently large , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another difference is that the circulation parameter of the vortex problem , which is analogous to mass , can be positive or negative .",
    "we will see that there can be a dramatic bifurcation as this parameter passes through zero.in the next section of the paper we carefully define the problem and build the important potential function . in section [ sect:3 ]",
    "we carry out the proof that nondegenerate critical points of this potential can be continued to relative equilibria with @xmath1 vortices having small , nonzero circulation and one having large circulation .",
    "moreover , we show that the linear stability of such a continuation is determined by properties of the potential",
    ". section [ sect:4 ] consists of applications of section [ sect:3 ] results to the cases @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in section [ sect:5 ] we discuss further results for large @xmath1 and do some numerical investigation .",
    "in particular , we prove that when @xmath3 the @xmath1-gon consisting of @xmath1 small vortices surrounding a strong central vortex is linearly unstable .",
    "we use this to show that when all critical points are nondegenerate there must exist at least two other families of relative equilibria of the full problem .",
    "we argue that one of these families is made up of linearly stable orbits when the central and surrounding vortices are of the same sign .",
    "we use numerics to study the candidates for the three families and carry out stability calculations .",
    "consider an inviscid , incompressible fluid in the plane with vorticity distribution described by a finite sum of dirac delta functions .",
    "note that this `` function '' is zero except at the locations of the point vortices .",
    "associated to each of these point vortices is an important quantity @xmath10 , called the _ circulation _ of the vortex . assuming the flow is acted on only by conservative forces",
    ", we may conclude that @xmath11 , a constant .",
    "we therefore treat @xmath12 as a parameter of the problem.with this in mind , let @xmath13 , @xmath14 be the positions of @xmath0 point vortices in the plane with associated circulations @xmath15 . then the equations of motion are described by @xmath16 where the hamiltonian function @xmath17 is @xmath18 for details , see @xcite.for @xmath19 the system is completely integrable , and all possible relative equilibria have been discovered .",
    "proof and examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "later , we will discuss how these orbits appear in the specialized problem of one strong and @xmath1 weak vortices .",
    "for @xmath20 the problem is nonintegrable , and hence more difficult . for proof of the nonintegrability of the four - vortex problem ,",
    "see @xcite or @xcite.we now specialize the general problem to our desired setting .",

    "this is consistent with the celestial mechanics literature .    definition [ defn:1 ] does not rule out the possibility that two or more vortices collide in the limit .",

    "we can prove a lemma which asserts that relative equilibria of the @xmath6-vortex problem have small vortices on a circle of fixed radius about the large vortex , which is also fixed . since the center of vorticity is an invariant of the problem we take it to be the origin for simplicity ,",
    "i.e. we choose @xmath44 .",
    "this will ensure that the large vortex is near the origin .",

    "we show in the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] that we may ignore this eigenvalue by focusing on the complementary eigenspace to the span of @xmath88.due to the hamiltonian nature of the problem , this eigenvalue must be paired with a second zero eigenvalue .",
    "physically , this second eigenvalue is born from what can be thought of as the scaling symmetry of the problem : associated to any relative equilibrium is a family of relative equilibria which are related to the first by a scaling and have different rotation frequencies .",
    "one may deal with this degeneracy by specifying a rotation frequency , as we did in the proof of lemma [ lma:1 ] . with this in mind",

    ". therefore , one says instead that an equilibrium is linearly stable if all eigenvalues are purely imaginary . in the proof of the main theorem of this section",
    ", we leave the two zero eigenvalues associated to scaling and rotational symmetry `` as is '' and call an equilibrium _ linearly stable _",

    "in numerical searches , we find just these three families for @xmath3 , and they are nondegenerate in every case computed .",

    "we investigate the hypothesis that this is also the case for the third observed family , thus highlighting the dramatic loss of stability that occurs when the circulation of the `` small '' vortices is opposite in sign from that of the `` large '' central vortex .      for all @xmath1 , the @xmath1-gon about a central vortex at the origin",

    "thus for @xmath39 sufficiently small ( as guaranteed by the implicit function theorem in our arguments ) , @xmath243 does not fall into the interval for stability and so the configuration is unstable .",

    "[ cor:1 ] assuming all critical points of @xmath76 are nondegenerate , there are at least three distinct families of relative equilibria of the @xmath6-vortex problem for @xmath2 , one of which continues to linearly stable equilibria when @xmath141 .",
    "the case @xmath193 was considered in section [ sect:4.2 ] . for @xmath3",
    ", we showed that the @xmath1-gon about a central vortex makes up one of these families , and that it is linearly unstable for @xmath48 sufficiently small .",
    "we now show that @xmath76 has a local minimum .",
    "this family continues to linearly stable relative equilibria when @xmath141 by theorem [ thm:2 ] . without loss of generality ,",
    "assume @xmath219 and @xmath245 .",
    "all other critical points of the potential are rotations or permutations of critical points of this form .",
    "then @xmath76 is a continuous function on the interior of the specified `` wedge '' of the @xmath1-cube @xmath246 that tends to positive infinity at the boundaries ( e.g. as @xmath247 ) .",
    "thus @xmath76 must achieve a local minimum inside the wedge.with restrictions on @xmath64 as above , consider the transformation @xmath248 where @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "since @xmath253 does not depend explicitly on @xmath254 we simply drop this coordinate and consider the function of @xmath255 variables @xmath256 .",
    "this removes the zero eigenvalue from the associated hessian . under this transformation ,",
    "the signs of the remaining eigenvalues of the hessian are preserved .",
    "then in the case of the @xmath1-gon , @xmath257 has exactly 2 negative eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the index of the @xmath1-gon for the gradient vector field @xmath258 is one .",
    "the index of the minimum is also one .",
    "thus we may apply the hopf index theorem ( see , for instance , the standard text @xcite ) to @xmath258 and obtain a third critical point of @xmath253 having index negative one .",
    "this implies the existence of a third critical point in the original coordinates which is a relative equilibrium of the @xmath6-vortex problem and is distinct from the @xmath1-gon and the minimum .",
    "we remark that if the minimum is isolated then it can be continued by topological arguments to the @xmath48 case . while more degenerate situations are conceivable , all the critical points seen numerically have been nondegenerate . assuming this is true of the third family given by corollary [ cor:1 ] , note that the associated hessian matrix must have an odd number of negative eigenvalues , and",
    "so it must be a saddle point of the potential when @xmath1 is odd .",
    "in this case , theorem [ thm:2 ] implies that its continuation to a relative equilibrium of the full problem is linearly unstable for all @xmath48 sufficiently small .",
    "numerics suggest that for all @xmath1 , even or odd , this third critical point is nondegenerate with exactly one negative eigenvalue . for this reason we expect its continuation to be unstable for @xmath141 and highly unstable for @xmath142 .",
    "thus , there is evidence that all three families of relative equilibria become very unstable as @xmath39 becomes negative .",
    "we supplement the discussion in the previous subsection with numerical findings . using an algorithm based on newton s method",
    ", we were able to locate three distinct families of critical points of the potential .",
    "we have run this algorithm for @xmath259 , and in all of these cases the critical points are relative equilibria of the @xmath6-vortex problem . in other words , they continue to relative equilibria of the full problem with @xmath48 sufficiently small.a representative from each of the three families is shown in figure [ fig:4 ] for @xmath260 .",
    "compare these equilibrium types to those in figures [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is natural to wonder if these three critical points correspond to relative equilibria of the full problem for all @xmath1 , and if they are exactly those critical points guaranteed by corollary [ cor:1 ] .",
    "we can not answer this question conclusively at this time , but we have numerically observed only these three families for @xmath259.for the two relative equilibria with `` clusters '' of small vortices , we have observed that as @xmath1 increases the cluster tends to fill out the unit circle more and more , and appears to approach the @xmath1-gon .",
    "this filling in process is beginning to become apparent in figure [ fig:4 ] .    using a modification of the algorithm , we were able to identify one of the three classes as containing nondegenerate minima of the potential",
    ". therefore this class corresponds to linearly stable sequences of relative equilibria of the full problem when @xmath141 .",
    "three representatives are shown in figure [ fig:5 ] .    to investigate the stability of the third class of critical points we computed eigenvalues of the associated hessian matrix for @xmath259 .",
    "we discovered that the matrix has exactly one negative eigenvalue and @xmath255 positive eigenvalues , thus leading us to believe that , like the @xmath1-gon , nearby relative equilibria are highly unstable when @xmath142 .",
    "we reiterate that this third family of relative equilibria has an odd number of negative eigenvalues ( at least for @xmath259 ) and is therefore a candidate for the third family of critical points guaranteed by the hopf index theorem in the proof of corollary [ cor:1].finally , we remark that for all three observed families of critical points , the positive eigenvalues of the hessian appear to increase monotonically with @xmath1 .",
    "this is still more evidence for the striking instability of all three relative equilibria of the full problem when @xmath142 .",
    "in this article , we examined solutions of a specialized problem in point vortex dynamics : the @xmath6-vortex problem",
    ". we were able to show that all solutions of this problem must be critical points of a specified potential function and that whenever such a critical point is nondegenerate in some appropriate sense , there exists a nondegenerate family of relative equilibria of the full @xmath32-vortex problem which converges to it .",
    "moreover , we were able to exploit properties of hamiltonian systems to show that the linear stability of a member of such a family is intimately tied to the potential.we used these results to prove that the @xmath1-gon about a central vortex is a linearly unstable relative equilibrium when the `` weak '' vortex circulation is sufficiently small if @xmath3 .",
    "we further showed that when all critical points of the limit potential are nondegenerate , there are at least two other distinct families of relative equilibria with @xmath1 vortices having small , nonzero circulation .",
    "one of these families was shown to be linearly stable when the central and surrounding vortices are of the same sign .",
    "our further numerical investigation supports the hypothesis that the problem has no linearly stable relative equilibria when the weak and strong circulations are opposite in sign .",
