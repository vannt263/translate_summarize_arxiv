    "of course , the locally coincident geodesic observer relative to the friedman metric sees no heat radiation - only @xmath41 positive dark zero point energy density vibrations of equal but opposite negative pressure per large space dimension , as required by the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) .",

    "the comoving observers that see an approximately isotropic wmap cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in our accelerating expanding universe are analogous to the static lnif observers in the schwarzschild model where now there is a universal acceleration @xmath50 m / sec^2^ , which is the same order of magnitude of the anomalous sun - centered radial accelerations of the two nasa pioneer space probes beyond the orbit of jupiter .",
    "this is a curious coincidence that possibly has deeper significance , although it is surprising to find hubble s parameter @xmath51 appearing on such a short scale local metric field .",

    "and so we dream that the final theory will use a more general connection than that of levi - civita .",

    "however , it must be supplemented by a similar torsion field equation that comes from the vanishing functional derivative of the total action s with respect to the 6 dynamically independent spin connection @xmath87 1-forms . the @xmath87 form the compensating gauge field induced from localizing the 6-parameter homogeneous lorentz group @xmath55 that also acts equally on all matter field actions , i.e.",

    "in this model there is no quantum gravity in the usual sense of starting with a classical field and quantizing it .",
    "rather , we go the opposite way in the spirit , though not the letter , of sakharov s 1967 proposal @xcite .",
    "what hitherto was called the classical gravity field is seen to be really an emergent effective _ macro - quantum coherent _ c - number post - inflation vacuum field .",

    "an infinite red shift surface  just like a black hole event horizon is for a static lnif observer .",
    "in contrast , we claim the universally attracting dark matter comes from residual positive - zero - point - pressure virtual fermion - antifermion pairs . in this picture , looking for real on - mass - shell dark matter particles in the lhc or in underground wimp detectors is like looking for the motion of the earth through the mechanical aether of galilean relativity using michelson and morley s victorian interferometer .",

    "advanced hawking radiation is emitted from the future cosmic ( `` de sitter '' ) horizon at all times and is blue - shifted as it travels into the past .",
    "however , only the advanced radiation emitted at time @xmath91 gyr arrives back at @xmath92 , where it ignites the big bang ( see figure 1.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "advanced information ( hawking radiation ) flows from the infinite future proper time `` omega '' @xmath13 horizon of the observer s world line ( shown in the lower `` conformal time '' ( @xmath93 ) diagram in @xcite fig 1.1 ) down the null cosmic event horizon to its intersection with the null particle horizon ( at @xmath94gyr , @xmath95gyr ) .",
    "it flows back along the particle horizon , winding up at the initial `` alpha '' moment of inflation completing what john cramer calls a `` transaction''@xcite .",
    "furthermore , looking at fig 5.1 of @xcite we see that the future cosmic de sitter horizon area @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the proper cosmic robertson - walker time ( corresponding to spacelike hypersurfaces of maximal cmb isotropy ) , rises from `` zero '' ( 1 bit ) to de sitter asymptote @xmath98 bits rather quickly .",
    "the advanced dark energy thermal hawking radiation reaching us now backward - through - time along our future light cone is very close to the asymptotic value .",
    "the final entropy of our ( retro)-causal@xcite@xcite universe is @xmath99 bekenstein bits , as mandated by the area of the future de sitter horizon , whereas the initial entropy of the universe is exactly @xmath100 bit , as mandated by the ( planck ) area of the initial singularity .",
    "this shows very clearly why the cosmological arrow of time is aligned with the thermodynamic arrow of time , solving roger penrose s main objection @xcite to inflationary cosmology : why the early universe has relatively low entropy .",
    "we need both retrocausality and the world hologram principle to properly understand the arrow of time of the second law of thermodynamics .",

    ". however , those authors do not clearly specify which horizon they are referring to .",
    "they omit the ( key ) notion of retro - causality .",
