    "the background field will be set to zero for this study .    in the massless case ,",
    "the theory has been solved by schwinger@xcite , and becomes equivalent to a theory of free , massive bosons , with mass @xmath13      for small electron mass @xmath14 , one can obtain analytic estimates by perturbing about the massless limit .",
    "caroll , kogut , sinclair and susskind@xcite found that the lowest - mass ( `` vector '' ) state has mass @xmath15 while the ratio of the next - lowest ( `` scalar '' ) mass to the vector mass was @xmath16 where @xmath17 is euler s constant .",

    "the background field values were taken high enough to achieve convergence to the required accuracy - usually values within @xmath65 sufficed .",
    "two different methods were tried to extract the continuum limit .",
    "the first method is a conventional double scaling analysis , as used by crewther and hamer@xcite .",
    "firstly , a sequence of finite - lattice results is extrapolated to the bulk limit , @xmath66 , at a fixed coupling @xmath67 ( or lattice spacing @xmath68 ) .",
    "this was done by means of a sequence extrapolation routine@xcite , namely the alternating vbs algorithm@xcite .",
    "errors were estimated by examining the consistency of the results using different vbs parameters @xmath69 .",
    "the sequence displays good convergence to the bulk limit , provided the lattice spacing is not too small .",
    "an example is given in table i.    the estimates of the bulk limit at finite couplings are now extrapolated to the continuum limit , @xmath70 , by performing a polynomial fit to the data in powers of @xmath71 or @xmath72 , which conforms to the expected asymptotic series behavior in the weak coupling limit@xcite .",
    "linear , quadratic and cubic fits were made to adjacent sets of data points , and extrapolated to @xmath73 .",
    "the convergence between these different estimates as the coupling was decreased was used to estimate confidence limits for the result .",
    "an example of the extrapolation is shown in figure 3 ( see later ) .",
    "note that at small couplings the estimates of the bulk limit become unreliable and carry large error bars .",
    "a second method which was tried is a modified version of an approach due to irving and thomas@xcite .",
    "the method involves a simultaneous scaling of the results with lattice size @xmath40 and coupling @xmath72 , in the fashion of a  phenomenological re - normalization group \" .",
    "eigenvalues are calculated for a sequence of lattice sizes @xmath40 and couplings @xmath72 , constrained by the requirement @xmath74 where c is a constant , so that as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , approaching the continuum in a single limiting process .",
    "the limit of the sequence can again be estimated using the vbs routine .",
    "for the massless case , @xmath77 , this procedure works extremely well , as discovered by irving and thomas@xcite , and shown in table ii . for @xmath77 ,",
    "we find by this procedure    @xmath78    to be compared with the exact results + @xmath79    irving and thomas@xcite in their previous study with @xmath80 were able to match and even surpass the results obtained with our present method i.    for the massive case , however , this procedure turns out to be rather less successful .",
    "the reason is not hard to find . for a finite system",
    ", we have : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the physical length of the system . to get the correct result for the excited state energies , a box size @xmath82 will have to be chosen which is larger than the physical size of the bound state under consideration . for the solvable massless case ,",
    "the physical size is zero .",
    "but for the massive case , this turns out to require such large values of @xmath82 that the extrapolation to the continuum limit becomes less accurate than method i. therefore this method was dropped from further consideration .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show examples of our estimates of the bulk limit of the vector and scalar bound - state energies as a function of lattice coupling @xmath72 , at small fermion mass ( @xmath83 ) and large fermion mass ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the behavior of the vector energy is monotonic , while the scalar energy shows a pronounced peak at finite coupling , which moves inwards to smaller values of @xmath72 as ( @xmath14 ) is increased .    at small @xmath14 ,",
    "the vector energy is almost perfectly linear in @xmath85 , and an extrapolation can be made to the continuum limit @xmath86 which is accurate to about 0.5% . at larger masses",
    "there is more curvature in the data , and any structure moves to smaller values of @xmath87 , as noted above in figure 1b ) .",
    "figure 3 graphs three different estimates of the continuum limit for @xmath88 , as functions of y , obtained by making linear , quadratic and cubic fits to the data at that value of y. the different estimates converge nicely down to @xmath89 , where our bulk data points begin to lose accuracy , leading to a final estimate of the continuum limit accurate to about 1% .",
    "for the scalar state , our estimates of the bulk energy do not reach far inside the peak region before they begin to lose accuracy , as seen in figures 2a ) and 2b ) .",
    "thus the extrapolations to the continuum limit are substantially less accurate again , at about the 2 - 3% level .",
    "table iii lists our estimates of the bound - state energies @xmath90 in the continuum limit , together with the earlier finite - lattice estimates of crewther and hamer@xcite , the more recent light - cone estimates of mo and perry@xcite , and the ` fast - moving frame ' estimates of krger and scheu@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that our present estimates are 5 - 10 times more accurate than the old results of crewther and hamer@xcite at small @xmath14 , but only 2 times more accurate at large @xmath14 ; while for the scalar state they are 2 - 5 times more accurate .",
    "the other authors have not attached error bars to their data .",
    "the higher - order light cone results of mo and perry@xcite are in excellent agreement with ours , over the entire range of @xmath14 .",
    "those of krger and scheu@xcite lie a little lower than ours for the vector state at both small and large mass ends of the spectrum .",
    "et al._@xcite obtain accurate results for low mass using a variational low - mass expansion , but because of the @xmath2 errors as the results approach @xmath91 the errors start to escalate",
    ".    figures 4 and 5 show graphs of our results as functions of ( @xmath14 ) , compared with the analytic perturbation theory predictions discussed in section ii . at small @xmath14",
    ", the numerical results match on well with the small - mass series expansions , equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) , although the scalar series begins to diverge away at around @xmath92 - presumably further terms in the series are required to get a reasonable result . at large @xmath14 , however , a definite discrepancy seems to occur : the numerical results lie significantly above the series prediction , by about three standard deviations .",
    "this discrepancy is somewhat puzzling",
    ". a closer look at figures 1b ) and 3 ) , shows a tendency for the data to curve downwards at small @xmath87 , which may indicate that our continuum estimates are slightly too high at these large values of @xmath14 . as for the results of mo and perry@xcite",
    ", it may be that the fermion self energy term has not been included in their analysis .",
    "the results of krger and scheu@xcite agree extremely well with the non - relativistic series at large @xmath14 . at small @xmath14",
    "they fall below both the analytic small - mass series and the numerical results of this work and mo and perry@xcite .",
    "this is presumably because they have not included the contributions of multi - quark sectors , @xmath93 and higher , which have significant effect in this region .",
    "for the scalar state , all results agree well with each other , and with the non - relativistic series in the regime of large @xmath14 .",
    "in this work a new finite lattice calculation of the lowest lying bound state energies in the massive schwinger model was carried out .",
    "lattice sizes up to @xmath94 sites were treated using an equal time hamiltonian lattice formulation .",
    "the results were @xmath95 times more accurate than a previous study@xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic series were calculated to a higher order .",
    "these results were compared with the light cone estimates of mo and perry@xcite and the  fast moving frame \" estimates of krger and scheu@xcite .",
    "the results generally agree very well , showing light cone techniques are powerful and effective for two - dimensional models , as first demonstrated by eller _ et .",
    "al._@xcite . the numerical results are generally in satisfactory agreement with analytic series results at large and small values of @xmath14 , except for a small discrepancy in the non - relativistic region for the vector boson .",
    "possible reasons for this discrepancy were discussed .",
    "calculations of this sort provide a useful demonstration that both lattice gauge theory and light cone techniques can give correct and detailed estimates for the behavior of continuum quantum field theory , in a case where analytic results are available for comparison .",
    "the schwinger model also exhibits some fascinating physical effects in its own right@xcite . in future work , we hope to apply both finite lattice and density matrix re - normalization group ( dmrg ) techniques to a study of chrial symmetry and background field effects on this model@xcite .",
