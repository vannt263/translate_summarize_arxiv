    "under the assumption of isotropy and homogeneity of our universe at large scale structure , people made a successful explanation to the cosmology accelerating expansion  @xcite by introducing a new component called de , which constitutes of about @xmath1 energy of the universe .",
    "up to now , the most successful view about the de is the @xmath0 model , in which the energy density of de is constant .",
    "although @xmath0 model is consistent very well with all observational data , it faces the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "alternatively , plenty of other de models have also proposed @xcite , but almost all of them solve the acceleration problem either by introducing new degree of freedom or by modifying gravity , which are challenges both in cosmology and in nuclear physics .",
    "however , do we really need the de ? or do we need so much de ? we notice that commonly the matter s eos comes from the classical thermodynamics without consideration of the gravity , has it been confirmed to be reasonable at the cosmological scale ?",
    "we think that the answer may be not sure , and our latest studies have provided different understandings of the long - range statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , if we apply the boltzmann entropy @xmath2 into the self - gravitating system , we will always obtain the infinite mass and energy with the principle of maximum entropy @xcite , which is a serious problem .",
    "@xcite preliminarily studies the entropy form taken by @xcite and proposes that a self - gravitating system s entropy is at a saddle point and not a maximum .",
    "@xcite completes the variation process of entropy and confirms that we can obtain an eos which is different from the classical one but can solve the problem we mentioned above .",
    "in @xcite we compare this eos with the van der waals equation and speculate that our eos should be a requirement of long - range statistical mechanics , which is also shown in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we think that the general relativity can also have similar effects on the matter s eos at the cosmological scale . so in the next section we will show our findings and propose a reason for the universe s accelerating expansion , which will not need the de . in section [ snia ] , we will use the data of supernova to shorten the range of the values of the parameters in our model .",
    "some discussions and conclusions will be made in the final section . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath3 and use `` @xmath4 '' to denote quantity s current value except @xmath5 below .",
    "according to the cosmological principle , the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "commonly the matter can be treated as the ideal fluid whose energy - momentum tensor can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy density , @xmath8 is the pressure , and @xmath9 is the velocity four - vector .",
    "when we substitute it into the einstein s equation , we can get the friedmann equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale factor .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation law is @xmath12 which also can be obtained from eq.([friedmann ] ) . combining the eos @xmath13 with eq.([friedmann ] ) , we can get the solution of @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "after the inflation , the universe is assumed to be a gas whose pressure is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean - square velocity , @xmath16 is the mass of particle , and @xmath17 is the defined temperature .",
    "we usually use @xmath18 and @xmath19 to denote the matter ( @xmath20 ) and radiation s ( @xmath21 ) eos respectively , but by eq.([class - p ] ) we can not understand the nature of the de whose pressure is negative , although we commonly treat that the de does negative work to the universe .",
    "notice that eq.([class - p ] ) can be derived by two ways @xcite : we can use the formula of the classical statistical mechanics to calculate the matter and radiation s eoss , both of which satisfy eq.([class - p ] ) ; it also can be obtained by the kinetics alone , which needs to consider the bombardment by the particles ( rigid body ) on the walls of the container to calculate the kinetic pressure .",
    "however , the classical statistical mechanics does not consider the effects of gravity .",
    "besides , the wall of the container does not exist in the universe , and in fact we can treat that the wall is equivalent to a potential well with minus infinity at the boundary for the free particles , while the gas in the universe is in the gravitational potential well which is different from the wall .",
    "if we treat the universe as a thermodynamical system where the particles interact by gravity , will these two ways mentioned above still be available under the cosmological background where the effect of general relativity can not be neglected ?",
    "we think that the answer is yes for the radiation , because the effect of gravity can be neglected compared with the electromagnetic force ; but for the matter whose main component is the dark matter where the gravity plays the most important role , the answer may be not sure .",
    "we consider this problem by two sides . on the one hand , in @xcite by the method of statistical mechanics we have obtained an eos which is used to describe the thermodynamical equilibrium state of a virialized self - gravitating system : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive , and @xmath23 has been identified to @xmath25 in @xcite .",
    "notice that here we take the newtonian gravity and the power index of the second term of eq.([eos ] ) s right ride must be less than 1 to ensure of the finite mass and energy of the system . from eq.([eos ] ) we can obtain @xmath13 , which can be approximately written as @xcite @xmath26 of course , eq.([eos3 ] ) is different from eq.([class - p ] ) even we let @xmath27 , and some different results possibly can be obtained . on the other hand , we consider the van der waals equation : @xmath28 where @xmath11 and @xmath29 is used to describe the attractive and repulsive interactions among the molecules of gas respectively , and they are determined by the potential of the molecules interactions by the method of cluster expansion in the canonical ensemble ( see some books of statistical mechanics such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we emphasize that the existence of @xmath11 and @xmath29 is determined by the statistical mechanics .",
    "if the potential of the molecules interactions has other forms , @xmath11 and @xmath29 may still appear in eq.([vander])but their values and other places may be changed .",
    "especially when we set @xmath30 and @xmath31 , eq.([vander ] ) becomes @xmath32 and is very analogous to eq.([eos3 ] ) , which makes us speculate that existence of @xmath24 in eq.([eos3 ] ) also is a requirement of possible statistical mechanics which can deal with systems with long - range interaction of the newtonian gravity , and the change of index from @xmath33 to @xmath34 may be caused by the change from the interactions among molecules to the newtonian gravity",
    ". then what is the case of that the particles are in the gravitational field described by general relativity ?",
    "the answer is that such theory still does not set up now , but we may do some guess of its results as the following : based on above analysis , we find that @xmath23 is related to the temperature , @xmath24 is necessary to denote the effect of the long - range statistical mechanics , and neither of them will disappear if the gravity changes from the newtonian to the general relativity ; but the index @xmath34 in eq.([eos3 ] ) may be changed in the general relativity .",
    "so we assume that at the cosmological scale the eos of the matter may be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a constant , and @xmath38 and @xmath5 are about constants or very slowly changing functions of time at the matter dominated era . here",
    "we temporally do not assume that @xmath15 is as small as its value in @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the form of eq.([eos2 ] ) can be directly borrowed from the van der waals equation , and only @xmath39 is speculated from our previous works .",
    "eq.([eos2 ] ) can be named `` the statistical matter model '' .",
    "now we will analyze the effect of eq.([eos2 ] ) on the universe s evolution .",
    "our model only modifies the pressure of matter , so the cosmic history before the matter - dominated era is believed to be littlely changed and here we only consider the later time . from observations",
    "we know that the unverse is always expanding , so @xmath40 is decreasing with time . when @xmath40 is large enough , @xmath41 is positive but is smaller than eq.([class - p ] ) .",
    "besides , there exists an era when @xmath42 like @xmath0 .",
    "but it is evident that the pressure in eq.([eos2 ] ) can be negative if @xmath43 which tells us that when the matter reaches the thermodynamical equilibrium , its pressure will be negative if its density is low enough .",
    "this really is a surprising thing and need to be further confirmed , but it may be natural in our model . if the matter s density is always decreasing , it will always can satisfy eq.([neg - p ] ) , then can this negative pressure cause the unverse s accelerating its expansion ? from eq.([friedmann ] ) this require that @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 of course this equation will also can be satisfied because of the expansion of the universe , so we find that if the long - range statistical mechanics is really different from the classical one and can produce an eos like eq.([eos2 ] ) , it will be the matter that drives the universe s accelerated expansion !",
    "the next question is that how the universe will evolve in the future , which requires some detailed calculations .",
    "we substitute eq.([eos2 ] ) into the eq.([conserve ] ) , then the matter s density will evolve as @xmath46^{\\frac{1}{1-t}}{\\nonumber}\\\\ & = & [ ( \\frac{c}{b})^{1-t}(\\frac{a_0}{a})^{3b}+ ... +(\\frac{\\omega_{x0}}{b})^{\\frac{1}{1-t}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the current radiation s density parameter .",
    "notice that @xmath49 . from observations",
    "we know @xmath50 and @xmath51 , if we define @xmath52 its current value @xmath53 will be much closer to 1 , which is a major difference of our model from @xmath0 . when @xmath54 ( or @xmath11 is small enough so that @xmath5 can be neglected ) and @xmath55 tends to be @xmath56 , eq.([rho - a ] ) will become @xmath57 . if @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the form of eq.([rho - a ] ) will be the same as a direct addition of the matter and de , so our model includes the result of @xmath0 , but we still provide a different understanding of the universe and any deviations from @xmath58 or @xmath59 will indicate the preferences of our model .",
    "because of the universe s expansion , from eq.([rho - a ] ) we can easily find that the density will finally approximately become a constant @xmath60 if we neglect the variations of @xmath38 and @xmath5 with time .",
    "so our model predicts almost the same destiny of the universe as @xmath0 : the standard model says that the energy consists of the radiation , the matter and the de , with the expansion of the universe the de will dominate and the expansion will accelerate ; while our result states that because there is some unknown physics such as long - range statistical mechanics , there is a no - zero minimum of the energy density of the matter even the universe will always expand , which also accelerates the expansion of the universe . however , this minimized density can be smaller than the de , because : from eq.([friedmann ] ) we know that @xmath61 requires that @xmath7 decreases slower than @xmath62 , so from eq.([rho - a ] ) we know that not only the constant term but also other terms whose power indexes are larger than -2 make the expansion accelerate .",
    "so compared with de , the value of eq.([rho - min ] ) should be smaller if @xmath63 . then if in the future the universe s density becomes a constant , according to eq.([friedmann ] ) our results may give a smaller value of the hubble parameter than the standard model , which also differentiates our results from the standard model .    before analyzing the data of snia",
    ", we need to calculate the hubble parameter .",
    "it can be expressed by four parameters @xmath64 in our model , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath67 in unit @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the redshift .",
    "to check our proposals made in sec .",
    "ii and to constrain the model parameters , we take use of the union2 dataset  @xcite and the hubble evolution data .",
    "the union2 dataset contains 557 type ia sn data and covers the redshift range @xmath70 $ ] , including samples from other surveys , such as cfa3  @xcite , sdss - ii supernova search  @xcite and high - z hubble space telescope .",
    "we fit the snia data by minimizing the @xmath71 value of the distance modulus .",
    "@xmath72 for snia is obtained by comparing theoretical distance modulus @xmath73+\\mu_{0}$ ] ( @xmath74 ) with observed @xmath75 of supernova : @xmath76^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}(z_{i})}.\\ ] ]    to reduce the effect of @xmath77 , we expand @xmath72 with respect to @xmath77 @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}(z_{i})},\\\\ g & = & \\sum_{i}\\frac{\\mu_{th}(z_{i};\\mu_{0}=0)-\\mu_{ob}(z_{i})}{\\sigma^{2}(z_{i})},\\\\ h & = & \\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}(z_{i})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( [ eq : expand ] ) has a minimum as @xmath80 which is independent of @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , it is equivalent to performing an uniform marginalization over @xmath77 , the difference between @xmath81 and the marginalized @xmath72 is just a constant @xcite .",
    "we will adopt @xmath81 as the goodness of fit between theoretical model and snia data .",
    "we also use the @xmath82 hubble evolution data from @xcite and @xcite , its @xmath83 is defined as    @xmath84^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}.\\ ] ] note that the redshift of these data falls in the region @xmath85 .    in summary , @xmath86",
    "and we assume uniform priors on all the parameters .",
    "we also assumed the prior that the age of our universe @xmath87 satisfies @xmath88 .",
    "the analysis is performed by using the monte carlo markov chain in the multidimensional parameter space to derive the likelihood . naturally , we employ some physically obvious limitations to make the estimation of parameters more robust , for example , we set @xmath89 in our analysis .",
    "we first investigate the constraint on the model parameters , and the best - fit values and errors of parameters are summary in tab.[tab : fit_result ] .",
    "we also plot the 1d marginalized distribution probability of each parameter , shown in fig.[fig : likelihood ] .",
    "the likelihood distribution shows a remarkable deviation from the gaussian distribution , which result in a discrepancy between the best - fit values and the expected values of the parameters , as consistent with the result in tab.[tab : fit_result ] .",
    ".[tab : fit_result]expected values , @xmath90 and @xmath91 error of @xmath92 in this model .",
    "the second line is in form of @xmath93 . and",
    "the best - fit values are also shown in the last line , which are different from the expected values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     1d marginalized distribution probability of @xmath94.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    @xmath95 and @xmath96 contour plot in @xmath97 plane .",
    "red dot in the center is the expected value.,scaledwidth=35.0%,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    further , we focus on parameters @xmath98 , which play a more important role in our model .",
    "the 2d contour plot is shown in fig.[fig : contour ] , which shows that the results of standard @xmath0 model is contained in our model .",
    "the @xmath99 errors mean that the case with @xmath100 is excluded at @xmath101 confidence level , which is consistent with our assumption . but constraint on @xmath55 can not be obtained .    from above results ,",
    "we find that the data of snia can not differentiate our model from @xmath0 .",
    "we need to consider the perturbation theory to further test our model , which will be another work .",
    "but from table.[tab : fit_result ] and figure.[fig : likelihood ] we can see that the data seem to indicate some deviations from @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "notice that according to current criteria , the dark matter is called to be cold if @xmath102 , which means that @xmath103 , so there is only a very short range of @xmath55 for the cold matter .",
    "however , both the best - fit and expected value of @xmath55 are larger than @xmath104 , which suggests that the matter may be not so cold as @xmath0 predicts .",
    "this conclusion also agrees with some works @xcite which aim to use the warm dark matter to solve the contradictions between observations and numerical simulations of @xmath0 at the galaxy scale .",
    "our previous works have proved that the thermodynamics of gravitating systems at the galaxy scale may be different from the classical one , and we obtain an eos like eq.([eos3 ] ) which is in analogy with the van der waals equation .",
    "so we speculate that it is the long - range statistical mechanics that produces the eq.([eos3 ] ) .",
    "based on possible effect of the general relativity on the matter s eos , we propose that at the cosmological scale the form of the matter s eos may be like the eq.([eos2 ] ) .",
    "then we find that with the universe s expansion the density will decrease with time to be a no - zero minimized constant matter density , and it is the matter that drives the expansion s acceleration .",
    "so our model provides a new kind of explanation for the expansion s acceleration , but there are three major different results of our model from @xmath0 :          it is more easy to compare our model with @xmath0 by the second point , so we use the data of snia to constrain the value of @xmath55 and @xmath37 . from the results we can not differentiate our model from @xmath0 , but",
    "there seems some indications of deviations from @xmath0 , especially we find that the matter may be not so cold as previously believed . to further test our model",
    ", we need to consider the density s perturbation in the future .",
