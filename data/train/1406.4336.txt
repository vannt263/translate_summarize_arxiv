    "electron emission by x - ray irradiated nanoparticle is an important subject of interest in the context of radiotherapy cancer treatment enhanced by nanoparticles of material such as gold .",
    "it has been shown that nanoparticles can improve cancer radiotherapy enhancing significantly cancer cell destruction @xcite and cancer healing on mice @xcite , comparatively to classical radiotherapy treatments .",
    "few theoretical approaches are available concerning this improvement , for example hyperthermia @xcite or radical production @xcite have been studied .",
    "one of them explains this increase of cancerous cells death by the nanoparticles emission of electrons .",
    "these electrons , released by the interaction of x - rays with nanoparticles , are supposed to be more efficient in the destruction of cancerous cells than the electrons released in water ( or tissue ) by the interaction of the same x - rays @xcite .",
    "but this electron emission is not well known and consequently nanoparticle critical parameters such as size or composition are often chosen following others criteria than electron emission : biocompatibility @xcite , commercial availabilities , production methods . to fill this gap many studies",
    "have been done using monte - carlo simulation methods @xcite with particle transport codes like livermore - geant4 or penelope - geant4 + @xcite .",
    "these simulations are time consuming , strongly code and model dependent and do not allow the easy analysis of key parameters such size and composition . therefore to complete these purely monte - carlo simulation studies , we propose a semi - analytical original approach for the electron emission of high - z nanoparticles .",
    "this approach combines a pure analytical model for photon trajectories and an electron cascade model partly based here on monte - carlo livermore - geant4 simulations , but which can be obtained by other models .",
    "+ in the first part of this paper , we develop the electron emission model for a nanoparticle and for an infinite plane surface . in a second part dedicated to discussion , we compare our model to livermore - geant4 results .",
    "we also compare nanoparticle and infinite plane surface electron emission and we analyse the place where electrons are produced inside nanoparticle and plane surface .",
    "finally we analyse the influence of the nanoparticle radius on nanoparticle electron emission with our model .",

    "@xmath101 as a function of the distance @xmath48 from absorption point , for energies between @xmath102 and @xmath103 on fig.[fig : electron_cascade_peak ] .",
