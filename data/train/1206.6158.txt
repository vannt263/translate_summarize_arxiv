    "following initial work by yang and coauthors@xcite on non - interacting ensembles@xcite with spin - resolved fractional occupancy , much consideration has been given to the behaviour of density functional theory ( dft ) under the kohn - sham ( ks ) prescription@xcite , and its various common approximations ( eg . lda@xcite , gga@xcite , becke - like@xcite , oep@xcite ) in such ensembles .",
    "many attempts have been made to understand and deal with the issues that arise in ensembles ( see eg .",
    "refs ) , with variable success .",
    "we will show that , in such systems , the notion of ` correlation ' physics becomes intertwined with ` exchange ' and ` hartree ' physics in the usual prescription , with ( improvable ) consequences for common approximations .",
    "let us begin by considering , quite generally , the nature of ` electron correlation ' and ` electron exchange ' in a non - ensemble system .",
    "the usual expression for the groundstate correlation energy can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of a many - electron system , @xmath7 is its groundstate wavefunction , and @xmath8 is some approximation to the wavefunction ( by the variational principle , correlation energy is never positive ) .",
    "thus correlation is not an intrinsic property of the system , but a property of the chosen trial wavefunction . in standard",
    "optimised effective potential ( oep ) approaches@xcite , including ks dft , @xmath8 takes the form of a single hartree - fock like slater determinant which is constructed from one - particle orbitals @xmath9 evaluated in a _",
    "common _ one - particle hamiltonian @xmath10 ) and energies are in hartree ( @xmath11aj ) ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we can now define the exchange energy @xmath14 and the `` naive hartree '' energy of the system @xmath15 here @xmath16 [ where @xmath17 is the electron number density operator and @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the external potential .",
    "the groundstate energy is thus @xmath20 where the partitioning depends on both the choice of @xmath21 and @xmath8 .",
    "this can be extended into ensembles by replacing projections on wavefunctions @xmath22 by traces on density matrices @xmath23 $ ] ( where operators act appropriately for any number of electrons ) and by summing @xmath21 over ensemble members .",
    "the density matrix @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the weight of member @xmath27 with wavefunction @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "minimisations can then be carried out over @xmath24 rather than @xmath30 .",
    "we can now succinctly define the standard ` exact exchange ' ( exx ) functional approach . here",
    "we consider only @xmath31 with @xmath32 assumed to be zero .",
    "investigations into exx in fractionally occupied ensemble systems@xcite show both successes and shortcomings ( discussed in more detail later ) . in all these works ,",
    "the hartree and exchange energy takes the ` standard ' form , _ bilinear _ in the occupations @xmath33 : @xmath34 \\label{eqn : nehx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here",
    "the negative exchange term cancels the unphysical positive hartree interaction of each spin orbital @xmath9 with itself .",
    "however if two different orbitals of the same spin are partly occupied ( @xmath37 with @xmath38 ) , or if there is partial occupation of both spins in the same orbital ( @xmath39 ) , there is a corresponding cross - term in that is not cancelled .    in a slightly different context gidopoulos _ _ et  al.__@xcite call this spurious term the `` ghost interaction '' as it represents an unphysical interaction between orbitals in different _ non - interacting _ ensemble members . in the regular exx energy expression",
    ", the ghost interaction appears in the hartree and exchange energy terms involving pairs of orbitals in the frontier orbital . in a kohn - sham interpretation of the equivalent diatom problem",
    ", these interactions would be supressed in the total energy via orthogonality of the degenerate groundstate wavefunctions .",
    "however , when one does not have the exact exchange - correlation functional , or as here neglects correlation , it can reappear , particularly when one does not properly account for the ensemble nature of the system .",
    "we will argue that , in the ensemble interpretation of partial occupation@xcite , this cross term should not be present , and its explicit removal results in an improved linear exact exchange ( lexx ) approach which is correctly piecewise _ linear _ , not bilinear , in the occupation factors @xmath40 . here , defining @xmath41 to be one for orbital @xmath9 occupied in ensemble member @xmath27 and zero otherwise , we exploit the fact that the ` ensemble occupancy ' factor @xmath42 requires weights @xmath43 that are piecewise linear in @xmath33 , from which it follows that @xmath44 is similarly piecewise linear .",
    "all energy terms are proportional to @xmath45 or @xmath46 and are thus piecewise linear . as will be discussed in more detail later this is equivalent , under an exchange approach , to finding a non - interacting ensemble of slater determinants formed from a _ common _ set of orbitals produced in a _",
    "common _ potential .",
    "this allows the creation of simple functionals that avoid much of the `` localization and delocalization error '' of yang et  al.@xcite , and the `` many electron self interaction error '' of perdew et  al.@xcite . in the present work we focus on two illustrative cases : i )",
    "a single partially occupied `` frontier '' orbital with @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; and ii ) open @xmath2 shells with @xmath49 .",
    "however the scheme itself has wider applicability , including the full dissociation problem of molecules .",
    "ref .   might be considered another specific example of this approach , while ref .",
    "outlines a similar approach via hf for the restricted case of fractional occupation of a single spin ( their 1sso approach ) .      to illustrate the general approach we consider , as an example , ensembles with total and spin - resolved electron number @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is even ) . the groundstate ensemble members and weights",
    "can be found be minimising over density matrices subject to various constraints .",
    "however for simple cases where energy ordering is obvious , one can construct the ensemble more intuitively , just by demanding that a given set of occupations @xmath33 be reproduced .",
    "for example if the frontier orbital is non - degenerate ( eg . in an @xmath1 shell ) , then the ensemble will be composed of up to three components . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the ensemble is formed from @xmath54 parts an @xmath55 electron system with extra electron in @xmath56 ( short - hand @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 parts @xmath59 and @xmath60 parts @xmath52 where , because @xmath52 is even , both spins are filled equally . for @xmath61",
    "the ensemble comprises @xmath62 parts @xmath57 , @xmath63 parts @xmath59 , and @xmath64 parts @xmath65 .",
    "the density matrix is composed of many - electron wavefunctions @xmath28 and is @xmath66 for the present case of a non - degenerate frontier orbial @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath53 while @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "this leads to a total energy @xmath72 = \\sum_{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}w_{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}e[\\phi_{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}]$ ] that obeys @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy of an @xmath52-electron system ( note that @xmath75 ) .",
    "the lexx is defined in general by assuming that the trial density matrix @xmath76 of the ensemble obeys the same relationship but with the component wavefunctions @xmath28 replaced by hartree - fock like determinants @xmath77 constructed from a _ single _ set of spin - dependent orbitals @xmath78 .",
    "this trial density matrix : i ) reduces to the regular exx for integer occupation , ii ) gives correct energies for h with less than one electron , split arbitarily between spins , and iii ) is constructed from a single set of orbitals @xmath79 evaluated in a common hamiltonian , a requirement that ensures that oep or ks methods can be used . here",
    "the orbitals are eigen - solutions @xmath80 of a one - body hamiltonian @xmath81 .",
    "we sort the orbitals so that @xmath82 for @xmath83 . taking the spin - resolved density",
    "@xmath84 $ ] one now finds @xmath85 where typically @xmath86 for the inner orbitals and @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the frontier orbital in the spin - shell with highest energy : which may or may not be occupied in both spins .",
    "the exx approximation ( @xmath89 ) allows us to use only the hartree and exchange ( hx ) components of the pair - density @xmath90 $ ] to evaluate the electronic groundstate . from the properties of hf wavefunctions , the pair - density of an ensemble",

    "good results have been obtained for atoms and diatoms@xcite and systems with fractional occupancy@xcite . in these",

    "indeed it is only true for the case @xmath131 , @xmath132 ( or vice versa ) occurring for half - occupied shells in n and p. here one must not only allow the spin - symmetry to be broken , but also break the spherical symmetry to make the bilinear expression correct .      while we have so far determined our ensembles using explicit knowledge of the degenerate groundstate , it is possible to carry out a more general ensemble minimisation to determine @xmath43 . here , for a given potential , we allow ensemble members ( determined by member occupancy factors @xmath41 ) to sample all combinations of ` occupied ' and ` unoccupied ' orbitals of the one - electron hamiltonian , and minimise the energy with respect to @xmath43 . in practice",
    "we would restrict the allowed ensemble members to limited combinations predicted to be low in energy .",

    ". such an approach might be useful for dealing with the difficult atomic dissociation problem .",
    "for a many - electron system the exx ( or lexx ) groundstate energy is composed of the orbital kinetic energy @xmath137 , the energy from the external potential @xmath138 and the hartree plus exchange energy @xmath139 . for an ensemble",
    "we calculate @xmath139 via , for example , the expansion - of @xmath140 for @xmath1 shells [ or - for equi-@xmath2 shells ] to form the orbital dependent lexx expression @xmath141 while for ` standard ' exx we instead use .",
    "the difference in energies between the lexx and ` standard ' exx for frontier @xmath1 shells is thus the difference between and .",

    "a similar expression can be derived for the like - spin correction to @xmath2-shells .",
    "we can now define orbital dependent groundstate energies via @xmath146 for the exx and @xmath147 for the lexx . in an optimised - effective potential@xcite approach",
    ", we look for a potential @xmath148 such that the orbitals satisfying @xmath149\\phi_{i\\sigma}=\\epsilon_{i\\sigma}\\phi_{i\\sigma}$ ] minimise the energy . here",
    "we call this approach the @xmath150 or @xmath151 ( with an overline to denote use of an optimised effective potential ) depending on the hx functional used . finding @xmath152",
    "involves , as input , the functional derivatives @xmath153 .",
    "thus the scheme for finding optimised lexx solutions differs only from that for the regular exx in that @xmath154 for the lexx includes an extra term for @xmath155 . via @xmath156 ,",
    "the additional term vanishes whenever @xmath54 or @xmath58 is integer , as expected ( at least for @xmath1 shells ) .",
    "let us consider some of the formal implications of the lexx .",
    "firstly , the total energy found in an optimised lexx scheme must be bounded below by the exx energy of the full ensemble . to prove this we first note that the ensemble exx energy @xmath157 for an ensemble of positive weights @xmath43 of elements @xmath27 can be written as @xmath158 $ ] where @xmath159\\phi^{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}_{i\\sigma}= \\epsilon^{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}_{i\\sigma}\\phi^{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}_{i\\sigma}$ ] and @xmath160 is chosen to minimise @xmath161 $ ] and may vary between different ensemble members . from - , it is clear that @xmath162=\\sum_{{{\\mathcal}{e } } } w_{{{\\mathcal}{e } } } e^{{{\\rm{exx}}}}_{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}[\\{\\phi_{i\\sigma}\\}]$ ] where @xmath152 in @xmath149\\phi_{i\\sigma}=\\epsilon_{i\\sigma}\\phi_{i\\sigma}$ ] can no longer vary separately for each part of the ensemble .",
    "thus by the variational nature of an oep we find @xmath163\\leq e^{{{\\rm{exx}}}}_{{{\\mathcal}{e}}}[\\{\\phi_{i\\sigma}\\}]$ ] and @xmath164 .",
    "secondly , we see that @xmath165\\leq e^{{{\\rm{exx}}}}[\\{\\phi\\}]$ ] for any set of orbitals @xmath166 and thus @xmath167\\leq e^{{{\\rm{lexx}}}}[{{\\rm{exx}}}]\\leq e^{{{\\rm{exx}}}}[{{\\rm{exx}}}]$ ] ( where the term in the square brackets labels the oep used to evaluate the orbitals ) with the equality holding ( for @xmath1 shells ) only when @xmath168 ( ie .",
    "when each of the spins is integer occupied ) .",
    "the former inequality follows from by noting that @xmath169 and @xmath170 as @xmath171 ( similarly for the like spin term ) and the latter follows from the minimisation principle of oeps . putting the oep inequalities together",
    ", we find @xmath172 where we include the overline ( indicating an optimised potential was used ) for clarity .",
    "the consequences of the improved pair - densities also extends beyond exchange physics . some beyond - drpa correlation energy methods [ see ref . for an overview ] like the rpax@xcite , rxh@xcite and pgg@xcite kernels , istls@xcite and tdexx@xcite depend in some way on the groundstate pair - density .",
    "the difference between the exx and lexx expressions will therefore manifest in _ correlation _ energies too . here",
    "we can calculate the correlation energy via the `` acfd '' functional ( see e.g. ref .  ) involving the orbital - dependent linear response function @xmath173 , and `` xc kernel '' @xmath174 . by way of example",
    ", the `` pgg''@xcite kernel directly uses the pair - density to approximate @xmath175 it thus captures the ensemble physics at both the lexx and correlation levels via @xmath176 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in figure  [ fig : enf ] we show correlation - free energies for h , li and na - like fractional ions calculated in the optimised exx and lexx schemes under the krieger , li and iafrate@xcite ( kli ) approximation to the potential in a real space code for spherically symmetric systems .",
    "results are presented for @xmath54 and @xmath58 ranging from zero to one such that @xmath40 ranges from zero ( e.g. na@xmath177 ) to two ( e.g. na@xmath178 ) .",
    "the true ensemble exx energy @xmath157 takes the same , piecewise linear form as but with groundstate energies @xmath179 of the ensemble members ( for integer @xmath52 ) replaced by exx energies @xmath180 from the optimal slater determinant .",
    "the sides of the surface plots show the case where one electron is integer and the other fractional ( or integer at the corners ) and it is clear that the results for the optimised exx and lexx are identical as expected . in the interior , however , a different picture emerges , with the required derivative discontinuities at @xmath181 being absent in the exx but clearly present in the lexx .",
    "the lexx also varies minimally with @xmath182 fixed ( along diagonals perpendicular to the projection ) , unlike the exx .",
    "the slight remaining non - linearity must be explained via the implicit dependence of the orbitals on @xmath40 as the energy formula is explicitly linear in @xmath40 .",
    "we are unsure if this is a result of the optimised effective potential approach itself , or the kli approximation thereto .",
    "the lexx clearly offers dramatic improvements over the exx in energy calculations . for li and na it also makes a good approximation to the true eexx energy without resorting to correlation physics . here",
    "the maximum variation from eexx is at most 6mha for li and na , significantly smaller than the correlation energies of 45mha and 396mha respectively@xcite for the neutral atoms . only for h , where the orbitals of h and h@xmath178 differ significantly through space , is the difference significant , growing to almost 20mha for @xmath183 , comparable to the h@xmath178 correlation energy of 42mha .",
    "the lexx was previously used@xcite to generate groundstates for correlation energy calculations .",
    "we are thus able to compare the correlation - free lexx results from that work with benchmark hf energies calculated by chakravorty _ _ et  al.__@xcite . to test the validity of the @xmath2 shell",

    "to numerical accuracy in our calculations this is close to exact agreement , and justifies both the lexx itself and the kli approximation to the oep , at least for integer electron number .     of c and f ions under the lexx approach with and without correlation",

    "we show results with ( rpa , pgg , exact ) and without ( lexx , eexx ) correlation energies evaluated in the `` acfd '' functional ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the lexx is used for the kinetic , external , hartree and exchange energies in all calculations bar eexx and exact .",
    "correlation energies are evaluated using the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and pgg kernel ( see ref .   for technical details ) .",
    "the exact groundstate energy of fractional ions of c is given by the piecewise linear function @xmath187 for @xmath188 and @xmath189 for @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the groundstate energy of carbon , @xmath192 is its ionisation potential and @xmath193 its electron affinity ( with similar expression for f ) .",
    "energies and ionisation potentials are taken from ref .   and affinities from refs .  .",
    "the eexx energy is defined in the same way but with @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 replaced by correlation - free exx values .",
    "clearly the lexx without correlation approximates the piecewise linear form , albeit incorrectly predicting negative fractional affinities for @xmath197 for c and @xmath198 for f. including correlation improves things , although even here there is a small range with negative affinities , at @xmath199 for c with the rpa and pgg kernels , and @xmath200 for f with the pgg kernel .",
    "it is clear that the `` lexx - pgg '' ( pgg evaluated with an lexx pair - density ) is a fairly good approximation to the groundstate ensemble energy at all fractions in both cases , especially for the positive ions .",
    "the derivative discontinuity shown here comes entirely from our correct treatment of hx in most cases , with a nonzero but very small extra contribution from correlation in the pgg case .",
    "we aim to further investigate correlation energies at fractional occupation in future work .",
    "while the discussion here has focused on fermionic systems with non - degenerate frontier orbitals and ensembles constructed around varying electron number , the general approach holds true for any non - interacting ensemble system .",
    "for example in bosonic systems , orbital si is not cancelled by exchange terms even for integer occupation , a situation which favours the present type of analysis of the `` hartree '' and `` exchange '' terms .",
    "other interesting cases include finite distance dissociation , where quantum superpositions of determinants are required as well as classical ensembles ; and thermal ensembles .",
    "lexx physics is also useful beyond the oep lexx method discussed here",
    ". it should be possible to construct local density functionals ( like the lsda ) from pseudo - densities based on the modified exchange and/or hartree pair - density via an approach like that of ref . or ref . .",
    "this perhaps provides some further justification for the success of recent work by johnson and contreras - garca@xcite .",
    "the lexx may also have potential uses in @xmath201-scaling dft approaches ( see ref .",
    "for a recent review ) .    by constructing a density matrix with similar properties to the exact ensemble",
    ", we were able to develop an lexx formalism yielding an orbital - dependent total energy via a pair - density , piecewise _ linear _ in the occupation factors , and involving ensemble averages of the one @xmath45 and two @xmath46 orbital pair factors [ see - ] .",
    "this is exemplified for doubly fractional @xmath1 shells in - with ghost - interactions supressed by the correction term and with similar expressions for @xmath2 shells discussed in - with additional like - spin correction term .",
    "using these energy expressions in the oep lexx functional proposed here gives clearly improved results ( with @xmath202 ) when compared with the more common form of exx , without resorting to correlation physics .",
    "this suggests that the very notion of electron correlation is imprecisely defined for oep or ks systems with fractional occupancy .",

    "<S> by exploiting freedoms in the definitions of ` correlation ' , ` exchange ' and ` hartree ' physics in ensemble systems we better generalise the notion of ` exact exchange ' ( exx ) to systems with fractional occupations functions of the frontier orbitals , arising in the dissociation limit of some molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the linear exx ( `` lexx '' ) theory whose pair distribution and energy are explicitly _ piecewise linear _ in the occupations @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide explicit expressions for these functions for frontier @xmath1 and @xmath2 shells . used in an optimised effective potential ( oep ) approach it yields energies bounded by the piecewise linear ` ensemble exx ' ( eexx ) energy and standard fractional optimised exx energy : @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the lexx explains the success of standard oep methods for diatoms at large spacing , and why they can fail when both spins are allowed to be non - integer so that `` ghost '' hartree interactions appear between _ opposite _ spin electrons in the usual formula . </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath4 contains a cancellation term for the spin ghost case . </S>",
    "<S> it is evaluated for h , li and na fractional ions with clear derivative discontinuities for all cases . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-shell form reproduces accurate correlation - free energies of b - f and al - cl . </S>",
    "<S> we further test lexx plus correlation energy calculations on fractional ions of c and f and again shows both derivative discontinuities and good agreement with exact results . </S>"
