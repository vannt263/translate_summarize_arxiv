    "recently , a variety of different discrete network systems have been studied in order to find the optimal geometries for enhancing both linear and nonlinear resonant wave transmission  @xcite , to reveal the conditions of the prefect reflection and fano resonances  @xcite , as well as to analyze the soliton propagation in the discrete structures where the role played by the topology of the network becomes important  @xcite .",
    "one of the major issues of those studies is to understand an interplay and competition of topology and nonlinearity in the dynamics and predict new interesting phenomena .",
    "many of such waveguide structures can be described as discrete linear and nonlinear networks composed of straight , bent , and crossed waveguides in which forward and backward propagating waves become coupled to each other via one or more crossings ( or network junctions ) .",
    "the well - known systems for realizing these structures are photonic - crystal circuits  @xcite , micro - ring resonator structures with more than two coupled channel waveguides  @xcite , and discrete networks for routing and switching of discrete optical solitons  @xcite .",
    "the important question is how the waveguide crossing affects the wave propagation in the network and how we can modify the junction transmission by making it nonlinear .",
    "examples of @xmath0-branched discrete network junctions .",
    ", width=264 ]    in this paper , we study the geometry - mediated localized modes and wave scattering in the structures composed of @xmath0 discrete waveguides ( ` branches ' ) crossing at a common point ( ` junction ' ) , as shown schematically in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a - d ) .",
    "this system can have direct applications to the physics of two - dimensional photonic - crystal circuits  @xcite , and it describes the transmission properties of the @xmath2-splitters [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , the waveguide cross - talk effects [ see fig .  [ fig1](c ) ] , and other types of photonic - crystal devices .",
    "we show that the intersection point of the discrete waveguides acts as a complex @xmath3-like defect even in the absence of any site energy mismatch , i.e. when the crossing point is identical to any of the waveguide points .",
    "therefore , the waveguide junction can be viewed as _ a topological defect_. we show that this new type of defect gives rise to two stable localized modes ( or defect modes ) at the intersection point , the staggered and unstaggered ones , regardless of the amount of nonlinearity or site energy mismatch at the junction .",
    "next , we study the scattering of plane waves by the crossing point , where the incoming wave propagates along one of the branches , and the waves are scattered to all the branches . in the linear regime",
    ", we find that for @xmath1 the reflection coefficient is always nonvanishing .",
    "this fundamental limitation prevents us from achieving an ideal @xmath2-splitter , unless we optimize and engineer the sites near the junction  @xcite . for a nonlinear junction of the crossed discrete linear waveguides ,",
    "we reveal the possibility of achieving the maximum transmission for almost any frequency of the incoming plane wave by tuning the input intensity . for some conditions ,",
    "bistability in the transmission may occur near the transmission maximum . to verify our analytical results obtained for plane waves",
    ", we study the propagation of a gaussian pulse across the junction by direct numerical simulations .",
    "the numerical results agree nicely with our analysis .",

    "we consider the system created by @xmath0 identical discrete linear waveguide ( branches ) crossed at a common point ( junction ) which we consider to be linear or nonlinear [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](a - d ) ] . the corresponding waveguide structure can be described in a general form by the system of coupled discrete nonlinear equations , @xmath4 where the index @xmath5 refers to the branch number ( @xmath6 ) . in this model",
    ", we endow the junction ( @xmath7 ) with a linear impurity @xmath8 and a kerr nonlinear coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "we notice that a similar discrete model can be derived for different types of two - dimensional photonic - crystal devices based on the green s function approach  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the complex field @xmath10 corresponds to the amplitude of the electric field .",
    "first , we consider the linear regime when @xmath11 , and all equations ( [ eq1 ] ) are linear .",
    "we start our analysis by investigating the possible localized states in the system ( [ eq1 ] ) . in order to do that , we look the solutions in the well - known form , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mode amplitude , @xmath14 is the corresponding evolution coordinate ( time in a general case , or the longitudinal propagation coordinate , for some problems of optics ) , @xmath15 is the frequency , and @xmath16 is the spatial ( or temporal ) decay rate of a localized state . after substituting this solution into eq .",

[ fig2 ] ] , @xmath28 therefore , the junction itself constitutes an example of a different class of defect : _ a topological defect_. this defect supports two localized states whose decay rates @xmath29 are inversely proportional to the number of branches @xmath0 .    in an inhomogeneous case when @xmath30 , the decay rate of the localized state can change drastically depending on the impurity strength .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) supports the solutions @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) , when @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) , when @xmath36 .",
    "this means that in these cases one of the localized states can disappear . by looking at the frequency dependence of the localized state @xmath15 on the impurity strength",
    "@xmath8 see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] , we see that one of the defect modes touches the band of the linear spectrum exactly when the corresponding localized state disappears .",
    "this happens precisely at @xmath37 .",
    "now we analyze the transmission properties of this new type of defect . to this end",
    ", we consider an incoming plane wave propagating in the branch @xmath38 and calculate the transmitted waves in other branches .",
    "we begin by imposing the scattering boundary conditions for eq .",

    "this plot shows that at the critical values @xmath44 , the transmission coefficient becomes maximum at the corresponding band edge , @xmath45 , when one of the localized states touches the edge of the linear spectrum [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] . for intermediate values ,",
    "@xmath46 , the maximum transmission is inside the propagation band .",
    "the shaded area indicates the possible values of the transmission coefficient .",
    ", width=264 ]    by combining these two conditions , we can obtain the amplitude of the transmitted wave , @xmath47 where @xmath48 . the transmission coefficient for any branch is defined as @xmath49 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) we see that even in the homogeneous system ( @xmath26 ) , the waveguide junction produces an effective geometry - induced complex @xmath3-like scattering potential , @xmath50 , which depends on the parameters of the incoming plane wave .",
    "we can write the transmission coefficient in the form @xmath51 the reflection coefficient is : @xmath52 .",
    "the maximum of the transmission coefficient @xmath53 can be reached for @xmath54 .",
    "we note that @xmath55 for @xmath1 , and it never vanishes . as a result , the @xmath0-junction system described by the model ( [ eq1 ] ) will always reflect some energy back into the incoming branch .",
    "this is a fundamental limitation which does not allow us to build a perfect @xmath2-splitter .    at this point",
    ", the following natural question arises : _ what happens in the system at the maximum transmission ? _ first , we notice that this point does not correspond to any resonance . according to the linear scattering theory",
    "all ( quasi-)bound states of our system can be obtained as poles of the the transmission amplitude ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the poles can be found in the complex plane from the condition @xmath56 , by assuming that the wave number @xmath57 is complex @xmath58 .",
    "complex wave numbers correspond to quasi - bound states with the complex frequency @xmath15 , and they can be interpreted as resonances where the real part of the frequency gives the resonance frequency and its imaginary part describes the lifetime ( or width ) of the resonance . after some algebra , we find that there exist only two solutions for @xmath59 , and for @xmath16 we have exactly the same solutions as in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "this means that our system does not support any quasi - bound states ( @xmath60 ) , and there exist only two real bound states ( @xmath59 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "what really happens is quite the opposite . due to the frequency dependence of the effective scattering potential @xmath62",
    ", it simply disappears when the condition @xmath63 ( or @xmath54 ) is satisfied . and",
    "the system becomes almost transparent .",
    "the nonzero reflection exists due to the nonzero imaginary part of the effective scattering potential @xmath64 .",
    "equation for poles of the transmission amplitude @xmath56 differs from the equation for the maximum transmission @xmath54 , and there is no relation between them .",
    "but , in fact , there exists the condition when these two equations may produce the same results , e.g. when @xmath65 and one of the bound state disappears . in that case",
    "we observe the maximum transmission at the corresponding band edge .",
    "this result can be understood in terms of levinson theorem , where a bound state just enters to or emerges from the propagation band and forms a quasi - bound state .",
    "now we can compare the dependencies of the defect - mode frequencies @xmath66 and the transmission coefficient @xmath67 on the impurity strength @xmath8 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ] .",
    "when @xmath33 , the first unstaggered localized state @xmath68 touches the upper band edge , and the maximum transmission takes place at that edge . for intermediate values of the impurity strength , @xmath46",
    ", we observe the maximum transmission inside the propagation band which moves towards another edge . finally , when @xmath36 the second staggered localized state @xmath69 touches the bottom edge together with the occurrence of maximum transmission .",
    "now we consider the nonlinear junction and analyze both the localized states and wave transmission . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the junction can support nonlinear localized states ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the decay rates @xmath29 can be found from the equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath71 where we have renormalized the impurity strength , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , all previous results about linear localized states remain qualitatively valid in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the only difference is that in the latter case , there is an additional dependence on the intensity of the localized state , @xmath73 .",
    "for instance , when nonlinearity is focussing @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) it follows that @xmath76 decreases while @xmath77 increases .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the corresponding modes @xmath68 and @xmath69 become narrower and broader , respectively . in the limit of large nonlinearity",
    ", the staggered localized mode will extend all over the branches , while the unstaggered mode will remain confined to essentially one site of the junction . stability analysis shows , that in both cases , the localized modes remain stable .",
    "we find no other localized modes , even in the strong nonlinearity regime .",

    "the shaded area indicates the possible values of the transmission coefficient.,width=264 ]    the presence of nonlinear junction generates much richer dynamics for the transmission .",
    "the transmission coefficient can now be written in the form , @xmath81 where @xmath82 satisfies the cubic equation @xmath83 @xmath84 is the normalized nonlinear parameter , and @xmath85 .",

    "it implies that the maximum transmission can be achieved for any frequency by a proper tuning of the intensity of the incoming wave [ fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the cubic equation ( [ eq14 ] ) reveals that for @xmath89 three solutions are possible , and the bistable transmission should occur ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
