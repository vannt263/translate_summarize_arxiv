    "the present paper is a continuation of @xcite . in the previous paper we dealt with the purely asymptotic estimations , whereas now our goal is to provide some estimates valid for quite a substantial part of the tail .",
    "we shall deal with the following simple case .",
    "an investor operating on an emerging market , has in his portfolio two currencies which are highly dependent , for example euros ( eur ) and swiss franks ( chf ) .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be their rates of returns at the end of the investment . let @xmath4 be the part of the capital invested in the @xmath5-th currency , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "so the final value of the investment equals @xmath8    our aim is to estimate the risk of keeping the portfolio . as a measure of risk",
    "we shall consider `` value at risk '' ( @xmath0 ) , which last years became one of the most popular measures of risk in the `` practical '' quantitative finance ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking the idea is to determine the biggest amount one can lose on certain confidence level @xmath9 .",
    "if the distribution functions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are continuous then , for the confidence level @xmath12 , @xmath0 is determined by the condition @xmath13 note that if @xmath14 denotes the @xmath9 quantile of the rate of return @xmath15 , then we can denote @xmath0 in the following way @xmath16    we shall based on the sklar theorem , which elucidates the role that copulas play in the relationship between multivariate distribution functions and their univariate margins ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we describe the joint distribution of rates of return @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the help of a copula @xmath1 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a distribution function of @xmath19 .",
    "note , that @xmath1 is the joint distribution function of the random variables @xmath20 i @xmath21 .",
    "we recall that a function @xmath22 ^ 2 \\longrightarrow [ 0,1],\\ ] ] is called a copula if @xmath23 @xmath24",
    "the copulas of financial returns have a specific property , namely they have uniform tails .",
    "we recall that a copula @xmath1 has a uniform lower tail if for sufficiently small @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a nonzero function , which is positive homogeneous of degree 1 ( compare @xcite ) @xmath28    for the daily exchange rates eur and chf in polish zoty ( pln ) we can observe this phenomenon even for 10% part of the tails .",
    "on the scatter diagram below ( fig.1 ) we plot the ranks of daily returns of eur and chf ( from january 1995 to april 2006 , 2858 returns ) .",
    "one can observe that there is more points at the lower and upper corners than average . at the second figure",
    "we enlarge the lower corner .",
    "+         to check the homogeneity of the lower tail of the copula we count the number of pairs of ranks in squares having the origin as a lower vertex @xmath29 and number of pairs in these squares under and over the diagonal @xmath30 @xmath31 on figure 3 we show the graphs of these functions .",
    "they are close to linear .",
    "+      the daily log - returns of exchange rates ( @xmath32 ) have the power - like tails ( compare @xcite  9.3 , @xcite  2.3.1 or @xcite ) .    for sufficiently small @xmath33",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35    for the daily exchange rates eur and chf in polish zoty ( pln ) such approximation are valid even for 10% part of the lower tails . on figure 4",
    "we plot the logarithms of minus log - returns against the logarithms of probability .",
    "our aim is to show how to estimate value at risk of the portfolio ( @xmath36 ) in terms of values at risk of portfolios of the same initial value @xmath37 but consisting only of one currency ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the first estimate requires only that the tail part of the copula is homogeneous of degree 1 .",
    "if for @xmath40 @xmath41 , where @xmath27 is homogeneous of degree 1 , then for @xmath42 @xmath43    the second estimate requires also some properties of lower tails of the marginal distribution .",
    "if for @xmath40 @xmath41 , where @xmath27 is homogeneous of degree 1 , and for @xmath44 @xmath45 then for @xmath42 @xmath46    on figures 5 and 6 we show the plot of the empirical @xmath0 of the portfolio ( @xmath47 eur , @xmath48 chf ) and the estimates based on the theoretical @xmath0 s for both currencies .",
    "we put @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51          now we are able to finish the proof of theorem 3.1 . + _ proof of theorem 3.1 .",
    "_ ( compare @xcite ) + due to the homogeneity we get @xmath61 \\times [ 0,\\alpha])= c(\\alpha , \\alpha)=l(1,1 ) \\alpha.\\ ] ] let @xmath56 . since the square @xmath57 \\times [ 0,\\alpha]$ ] is contained in @xmath52 , we have @xmath62 therefore the @xmath63 quantile of @xmath15 is smaller than @xmath33",
    ". thus @xmath64 this finishes the proof of theorem 3.1 .",
    "+    let @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath45 then the function @xmath65 has the following properties : + @xmath66 @xmath67 is strictly convex and increasing ; + @xmath66 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ; + @xmath66 @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "_ we have @xmath73 @xmath74 hence @xmath75 furthermore @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 hence @xmath79 moreover the first derivative is always positive , hence @xmath67 is strictly increasing . also the second derivative is always positive ( hence @xmath67 is strictly convex ) . indeed : the second component of the first derivative is a product of four positive factors , from which only the last one ( @xmath80 ) has negative derivative but it is reduced by positive derivative of the first component . @xmath81",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 since @xmath87 is greater then 1 the final result is positive .",
    "+      _ proof .",
    "_ @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 since @xmath27 is homogeneous of degree 1 , its first derivative is homogeneous of degree 0 .",
