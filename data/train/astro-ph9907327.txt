    "in x - ray dipping sources , accretion disk structure extends vertically above the plane of the binary and periodically blocks the line of sight to the central compact object .",
    "this structure is believed to be a bulge in the disk edge , associated with the impact point of the accretion stream from the secondary star .",
    "because of this azimuthal material , the x - ray light curves of these low - mass binaries contain deep , irregularly - shaped dips associated with large increases in absorption , that recur on the orbital period of the system .",
    "currently we know of @xmath010 x - ray dippers .",
    "has an orbital period of 3.88 hrs , and generally displays dips of up to 95% of the 110 kev flux lasting @xmath00.8 hr per cycle ( courvoisier et al .",
    "its counterpart , gr  mus , has a mean optical brightness of @xmath6=19.0 mag , and shows a broad optical modulation probably due to the changing visibility of the heated face of the secondary star in the system , with an additional contribution from the x - ray - heated bulge ( motch et al .  1987 , hereafter mea ) .",
    "a short ( 5-hr ) section of simultaneous x - ray and optical coverage showed that the optical minimum occurs 0.15 in phase after the center of the x - ray dips ( mea ) , supporting the system geometry described above .",
    "modeling of the observed variability leads to constraints on the source inclination of 65@xmath773@xmath7 , and on the distance of 815 kpc ( mea ) , and makes the prediction that the shape of the optical light curve should be correlated with the length of the x - ray dips , since both depend upon the angular extent of the accretion disk structure . in an attempt to confirm the linkage between the observed optical and x - ray characteristics in lmxbs , we undertook a program of simultaneous observations of  using the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) and the facilities at ctio .",
    "observations of the optical counterpart of  were performed at the ctio 1.5 m telescope on 1997 april 28  may 1 , using the tek2k ccd with a pixel scale of 0.24  pix@xmath8 .",
    "we obtained a total of 28 hours of ccd photometry , with typical exposure times of 600 sec in @xmath6 and 900 sec in @xmath9 .",
    "overscan and bias corrections were made for each ccd image with the _ quadproc _ task at ctio to deal with the 4-amplifier readout .",
    "the data were flat - fielded in the standard manner using iraf , and photometry was performed by point spread function fitting using daophot ii ( stetson 1993 ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the standard system through observations of several landolt standard star fields ( landolt 1992 ) . the systematic error ( from the transformation to the standard system ) in these optical magnitudes is @xmath20.10 mag , although the internal intrinsic 1@xmath10 error in the relative photometry is estimated to be @xmath20.02 mag , based on the rms scatter in the light curves of comparison stars of similar brightness .",
    "simultaneous x - ray data from  were obtained using the rxte satellite .",
    "the data presented here were collected by the pca instrument using the standard 2 and good xenon configurations , with time resolutions of 16 sec and @xmath11sec respectively , and full spectral resolution .",
    "the scheduling flexibility of rxte enabled us to achieve an impressive degree of simultaneity with our ground - based observing program , with 70 ksec of total coverage during our optical run .",
    "an additional section of x - ray data lasting 10 ksec was obtained on 1997 may 5 .",
    "background subtraction was performed using modeling based on the instantaneous high - energy particle flux as measured by the six - fold anticoincidence counters in the pca , along with minor contributions from activation during saa passages and the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "c    c    the optical and x - ray light curves for these observations are shown in fig .",
    "[ x1254fig1a],fig .",
    "[ x1254fig1b ] .",
    "tick marks are plotted in the upper panel , indicating the expected times of optical minimum throughout the observation , based on a folding analysis of the data and an orbital period of @xmath12=0.163890 dy .",
    "( the ephemeris of mea is not precise enough to extrapolate into the epoch of the rxte observations ) .",
    "the ticks in the lower panel were generated by subtracting 0.15@xmath13 from the times of optical minimum , and represent the expected times of x - ray dip centers based on the standard lmxb system geometry .",
    "below , we follow the usual convention and define phase zero as the time of optical minimum .",
    "the x - ray light curve presented in fig .  1 bears little resemblance to the previous behavior of the source ( e.g. courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 , fig .  1 ) . in the 210 kev energy range chosen for this figure ,",
    "the observed reduction in flux during dips is generally 2095% , with a dip duration of 20% of the total cycle ( courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 ) ; no such dramatic activity is seen in fig .  1 , even though we have good coverage of the expected times of all or part of five separate dips .",
    "c    small variations are seen in the x - ray light curve , particularly at jd  245  0567.6 . however , as we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ x1254fig2 ] , the x - ray hardness ratio is strongly correlated with intensity during these episodes .",
    "this indicates that the flux reductions observed are due to intrinsic variations in the intensity of the central source , rather than absorption events caused by obscuration of the flux by accretion disk material .",
    "true dipping events are associated with an increase in low - energy absorption , and therefore an _ inverse _ correlation between hardness and intensity ( e.g. courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 ; smale et al .",
    "the 1997 may 5 data ( not shown here ) include an interval spanning a sixth expected x - ray dip , but are similarly featureless .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for dipping activity during our rxte observations .",
    "c    our spectral fitting bears out this conclusion .",
    "fitting short sections of data accumulated before , during , and after the apparent flux reduction episode at jd 245  0567.6 seen in the first night of rxte observing ( fig .  1 ) , we find that the 215 kev spectra can be well fit with a cut - off power law with photon index of @xmath14=0.6@xmath20.1 and cut - off energy @xmath15=4.3@xmath20.3 kev .",
    "we find a mean equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath16=4.8@xmath1710@xmath18  cm@xmath8 , and can set an 90% upper limit on the increase of this @xmath16 during the flux reduction episode of 4@xmath1710@xmath18  cm@xmath8 , two orders of magnitude less than the @xmath205@xmath1710@xmath21  cm@xmath8 measured during the deep dips of courvoisier et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ x1254fig3 ]  we present the folded optical and x - ray light curves for our observations .",
    "the optical light curves both show quasi - sinusoidal variability on the 3.88-hr period , with full amplitudes of modulation of 0.28@xmath20.01 mag in @xmath6 and 0.30@xmath20.01 mag in @xmath9 .",
    "by contrast , we can place an upper limit of 2% on the presence of a significant x - ray orbital modulation .",
    "we find no significant correlations between the x - ray and optical light curves on timescales of 10@xmath2210@xmath23s , using the @xmath24-transformed discrete correlation function of alexander ( 1998 ) .",
    "we also detect no significant lag between the @xmath6 and @xmath9 light curves , and no significant autocorrelations in the x - ray flux .",
    "binning up the folded @xmath9 and @xmath6 lightcurves in fig .  3",
    ", we can place a 90% upper limit of 0.03 mag on the amplitude of any orbital variation in @xmath25 .",
    "no high - frequency variations were detected in the persistent x - ray emission , with typical upper limits of 13% on the rms amplitude of any quasi - periodic oscillations between 5001200 hz .",
    "variations in the depth and duration of dips in x - ray binaries are well - known . in the extreme case of the short - period ( 50  min ) source x1916@xmath26053 , dips can last for 10% to 50% of the binary cycle and have depths of 10% to 100% ( smale et al .",
    "these dip depths and widths are seen to vary on a timescale much greater than the orbital period ( 46 days , smale et al .",
    "1989 , yoshida et al.1995 ) . in this example",
    ", the variations in dip properties may be due to the flux - modulating effects of a third star in the system , a scenario that is unlikely to be widespread among lmxbs .",
    "itself shows variability in dip depth from 95% to 20% , and has skipped a dip in the past ; extracting the complete light curves from the 1984 and 1985 exosat observations from the heasarc archives , we find that of the fifteen times of expected dipping covered by the data , 11 deep dips were observed , 3 shallow dips ( @xmath020% ) , and one case where the dip is undetectable .    however , the light curves observed in the current dataset display a lack of dip activity unprecedented among the dip sources . in the exosat observations of courvoisier",
    "et al . ( 1986 ) , the dip duration was observed to be @xmath00.8 hrs , representing 20% of the binary cycle .",
    "if dip activity from  had been nominal we would have seen evidence of 6 complete or partial dips during our rxte coverage . a priori , we can not rule out the possibility that dips occurred only during the intervals between observations during which rxte was not obtaining data from , but this seems statistically unlikely .",
    "if a dip or a non - dip are equally likely to occur in a given cycle , the probability of observing a dip on at least one of our 6 opportunities is @xmath27 98% . in other words ,",
    "even if dips occur as infrequently as half the time , the chances are slight that we would fail to see evidence for one during our rxte coverage .    in reality",
    ", dips are observed from dipping sources @xmath2895% of the time .",
    "in addition , the appearance or otherwise of dips in adjacent cycles are not statistically independent events .",
    "it therefore seems much more realistic to postulate that dipping has ceased entirely during our observations .",
    "we argue below that the optical behavior of the source provides independent corroboration of this assertion .    in lmxbs like  it",
    "is generally believed that the steady component of the optical flux comes from the disk ( e.g.  van paradijs & mcclintock , 1995 ) .",
    "our measured mean @xmath6 magnitude of 19.0 is almost identical to the @xmath6 brightness observed by mea when the source was dipping .",
    "also , our observed 210 kev x - ray flux of 7.4@xmath1710@xmath29 erg  @xmath30  s@xmath8 is comparable to the non - dip intensity observed by courvoisier et al .",
    "we therefore deduce that the accretion disk radius and mean mass accretion rate are unchanged ; the disk just lacks the vertical structure usually associated with the impact point of the accretion stream .",
    "detailed modeling of the disk during active dipping cycles has shown that the typical aperture angle of the disk in  is 913@xmath7 , while the bulge itself extends to an azimuthal height of 1725@xmath7 ( mea ) .",
    "the inclination of the system is restricted to 6573@xmath7 .",
    "thus , the absence of regular dipping implies that this bulge height has shrunk in angular size from 1725@xmath3 to @xmath31 .",
    "we expect the varying component of the optical flux to have contributions from both the heated face of the secondary and the bulge .",
    "the full amplitude of the optical modulation has been previously measured at @xmath1=0.40@xmath20.02 mag ( mea ) , and their subsequent modeling suggests that @xmath1=0.25 mag of this originates in the heated face and @xmath1=0.15 mag from the bulge .",
    "our measured full amplitude of @xmath1=0.28@xmath20.01 mag is therefore very close to the value we would predict if the optical flux variations were now solely caused by the variable aspect of the heated face .    another , more circumstantial piece of corroborating evidence for our theory is supplied by our measured mean @xmath25 of 0.15@xmath20.02 mag compared to the mean @xmath25 of 0.31@xmath20.05 mag observed when the source was dipping ( mea ) .",
    "based on evidence from similar systems such as x1636@xmath26536 ( @xmath12=3.80 hr ) , we would expect the photospheric temperature of the heated face to be @xmath025,00035,000  k",
    "( e.g. smale & mukai , 1988 ) , a value which matches the estimates from hydrodynamic modeling of irradiated companion star envelopes ( typically 20,00040,000  k ; tavani & london 1993 ) . the illuminated surfaces of x - ray - heated accretion disks should have a similar effective temperature .",
    "however , the outer edge of the accretion disk ( including much of the outer bulge ) will be screened from the direct illumination , and should therefore be much cooler  modeling of the uv , optical and ir light curves of x1822@xmath26371 ( @xmath12=5.57 hr ) indicates an effective temperature of 14,500  k for these outwards - facing regions ( mason & crdova 1982 ) , incidentally comparable to the bright spot temperatures observed in cvs of 15,000  k ( wood et al . 1989 ) .",
    "so , for high inclination sources with disk edge structure such as  and x1822@xmath26371 , cooler material will generally obscure at least part of the hotter , inner disk regions .",
    "a disappearance or reduction in the size of the azimuthal structure then leads to a more direct viewing of these hot regions , and an increase in the apparent mean emission temperature .",
    "although hard to model without a more detailed knowledge of the system , the reduction we see in @xmath25 is in the correct direction for such an increase in the mean temperature of the overall optical emission .",
    "the existence of azimuthal structure at the edge of the accretion disks in lmxbs is empirically well - established , but theoretically difficult to explain .",
    "phenomenological modeling of the dipping sources shows that this structure must have a scale height of @xmath015% of the disk radius or more , and sustain itself over time intervals of weeks to months .",
    "however , such a scale height is more than can be naturally produced by either irradiation or disk turbulence ( king 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , material in ballistic orbits can not produce the heavily structured appearance of the obscuring material . in the absence of a good physical model for the vertical disk structure ,",
    "the reason for its reduction or disappearance can be only conjecture .",
    "however , the disappearance may perhaps be connected with a short - lived ( @xmath0hrs - days ) reduction in the accretion flow from the secondary .",
    "such a variation could be smoothed out by viscosity effects during the transfer of material through the accretion disk , leaving the time - averaged x - ray flux unchanged ."
