    "the infinite lattice coordination limit introduced by metzner and vollhardt@xcite forms the basis for the dynamical mean field theory(dmft)@xcite that maps the hubbard model@xcite onto an anderson impurity model(aim)@xcite .",
    "even though the spatial degrees of freedom are completely frozen and the anderson impurity model is much simpler than the original lattice model , it is still a nontrivial many - body problem . in practice ,",
    "the most difficult step in the dmft iterative procedure is the repeated calculation of the impurity green s function @xmath1 of the impurity problem for any given arbitrary conduction electron effective bath @xmath2 .",
    "anderson impurity model can be solved either by numerical methods like exact diagonalization(ed)@xcite , quantum monte carlo(qmc)@xcite , numerical renormalization group(nrg)@xcite or by analytic methods like iterated perturbation theory(ipt)@xcite .",
    "most of these methods have limitations confining them to a particular regime , ie high temperature(qmc ) or low temperature(ed , nrg ) .",
    "exact diagonalization(ed)@xcite is an important technique for studying quantum many - body systems .",
    "green s function at finite temperature can be computed using all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained via full diagonalization .",
    "full diagonalization needs an explicit representation of the matrix , requiring lot of memory space .",
    "therefore it is limited to small clusters because of large memory required for an exponentially growing hilbert space .",
    "moreover , for diagonalizing an @xmath3 matrix , @xmath4 floating point operations(flops ) are required .",
    "but if the matrix is sparse and a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors are required then we can resort to iteration methods like the lanczos@xcite method or the davidson@xcite method .",
    "green s function at zero temperature can computed by continued fraction expansion using lanczos coefficients .",
    "green s function at very low temperature can be computed by the set of equations used by capone et al@xcite .",
    "lanczos method is an implementation of the rayleigh ritz procedure@xcite on a krylov subspace@xcite whereas davidson method is on non - krylov subspace . in this paper",
    ", we use the orignal version of davidson method and the simplest version of the lanczos algorithm and find that the inclusion of davidson method in evaluation of green s function in low temperature regime can be favourably used to our advantage .",
    "the contents of this paper are organised as follows . in section ii . , we describe the orthogonal projection method explaining the lanczos and davidson algorithm . in section iii .",
    ", we discuss the computation of green s function at different temperature regimes .",
    "section iv . gives a sketch of dmft procedure . in section v. , we show the comparision between the davidson@xmath0lanczos method of computation of green s function and the full ed . finally in section vi .",

    "the numerical procedure for computing the galerkin approximations to solve the eigenvalue problem is known as the rayleigh - ritz procedure .",
    "we describe the procedure in a step - by - step way as follows :    1 .",

    "3 .   compute the desired eigenvalue @xmath35 and eigenvector @xmath36 of the small matrix @xmath28 , where @xmath37 .",
    "4 .   compute the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "davidson@xcite proposed an iterative calculation for the diagonalization of large , sparse , real - symmetric matrices to find a few of lowest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "davidson method generates an orthonormal set of @xmath30 basis vectors onto which a projection of the matrix to be diagonalized is performed and a correction vector is computed if the residual vector of the computed eigenvector is not a null vector .",
    "let @xmath35 be desired the ritz eigenvalue and @xmath40 be the ritz eigenvector of the eigenvalue problem @xmath41 and @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath42 be an n - component correction vector .",

    "this correction vector is made orthogonal to all the previous vectors and then added to the basis set .",
    "this procedure is repeated until convergence , i.e. a null residual vector .",
    "if the dimension of the subspace spanned by these basis vectors becomes inconveniently large due to successive augmentation of the subspace , the calculation is restarted with the first @xmath44 ritz eigenvectors .",
    "if several eigenvectors are sought , then the first @xmath30 ritz eigenvectors obtained at the end of finding one eigenvector provides a good starting set for the next eigenvector .",
    "the jacobi - davidson@xcite method of solving the sparse eigenvalue problem combines the davidson@xcite method and the jacobis@xcite approach and has improved convergence properties .",
    "but we use the orignal davidson method taking the preconditioning matrix as the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix to compute its groundstate and a few excited states and give reasons for our choice in section vi ..    we find @xmath45 eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath3 hamiltonian matrix @xmath38 using davidson method in algorithm i , given in appendix [ algo1 ] , where @xmath46 is a one - dimensional array of length @xmath47(dimension of @xmath38 ) storing all the diagonal elements of the @xmath38 and we start with @xmath48 number of trial vectors which is greater than @xmath45 .",
