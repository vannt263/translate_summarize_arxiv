    "vanadium is a transition metal with electronic configuration @xmath23d^{3}4s^{2}$ ] that forms a body - centered cubic structure ( bcc ) .",
    "the bcc structure contains tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial sites that can accommodate hydrogen @xcite . in bulk",
    "vanadium the hydrogen is found to reside in tetrahedral sites at low concentrations ( @xmath0-phase ) , while in the @xmath1-phase h occupies octahedral sites@xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the hydrogen induced local strain field is strongly depending on the site occupancy , which is reflected in the hydrogen induced expansion of the lattice@xcite .",
    "when hydrogen resides in a tetrahedral site , the local strain field is close to spherical , while it is almost uniaxial when hydrogen resides in the octahedral sites .    in a body - centered tetragonal structure",
    "there are three types of tetrahedral sites and three types of octahedral sites and there are in total three octahedral and six tetrahedral sites per metal atom ( figure [ ot ] ) .",
    "the six tetrahedral sites comprise of four @xmath3 and two @xmath4 sites ( @xmath4 refers to either one of the equivalent @xmath5 or @xmath6 sites ) .",
    "the three octahedral sites comprise of one @xmath7 and two @xmath8 sites .",
    "the local elastic response of the lattice arising from the presence of hydrogen in these interstitial sites @xcite gives rise to a local strain field , which is the cause of the hydrogen induced expansion@xcite .",
    "the expansion can be viewed as the sum of the hydrogen induced local strain fields and can therefore , in principle , be used to determine the preferred site occupancy of hydrogen .",
    "the volume changes depend strongly on the boundary conditions and site occupancy , enabling the polarization of the local strain fields .",
    "this can , for example , be experimentally accomplished by the use of clamping @xcite as the preferred site occupancy of hydrogen in vanadium is linked to the strain state of the structure @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen induced volume changes of a clamped epitaxial film is restricted to the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "for example , a single crystal vanadium ( 001 ) film on a mgo(001 ) substrate will exhibit a lattice expansion ( or contraction ) in the ( 001 ) direction , independent of site occupancy @xcite .",
    "clamping of v can therefore be used to change the volume expansion , as only 1/3 of the strain field will propagate to the surface , when hydrogen is residing in tetrahedral sites . by the same token ,",
    "the uniaxial component of the local strain field arising from a @xmath7 site occupancy will reach the free boundaries and therefore not restrict the expansion .",
    "furthermore , when hydrogen resides in @xmath9 or @xmath10 sites , the local strain field can not give rise to any expansion due to the constraint implemented through elastic boundary conditions ( clamping ) .",
    "clamping and straining a v layer will therefore strongly affect the site occupancy , and thereby the observed volume changes @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present computational study is to provide a conceptual framework on the influence of strain on site occupancy in vanadium .",
    "the results are generalised and can be used as a guidance when discussing hydrogen occupancy in any transition metal .",
    "thus , we use computational methods to perform `` virtual experiments '' using an atomistic framework and first - principles methodology to explore the influence of polarization of the hydrogen induced local strain fields generated in bulk vanadium .",
    "the results provide a plausible atomistic description of the @xmath7 site occupancy at low concentrations in strained v layers@xcite , change of site occupancy with hydrogen concentration in biaxially strained lattices as well as providing insight on the origin of the observed hysteresis @xcite in hydrogen absorption and desorption in bulk v. +    -axis is aligned along the vertical direction , while the @xmath11- and @xmath12-axes lie in the horizontal plane.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the calculations were performed using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the interactions between the electrons and the nuclei was obtained using the projector - augmented - wave method @xcite .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite approach was employed to approximate the exchange and correlation terms in the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite method .",
    "a conjugate gradient algorithm was used to relax the atomic nuclei positions to a local minimum in the total energy landscape .    in order to reduce h - h interactions resulting from",
    "the imposed periodic boundary conditions while still studying a system that is small enough to be computationally manageable for a large number of calculations , a supercell consisting of 128 vanadium atoms ( @xmath13 bcc unit cells ) was constructed to mimic bulk vanadium in which the lowest possible ratio of hydrogen to vanadium [ h / v ] is 1/128 ( corresponding to 0.775 at.% of hydrogen ) . due to the rather large dimensions ( 11.9  @xmath14 11.9  @xmath14 11.9  ) of the supercell ,",
    "only the @xmath15 point was used in sampling the brillouin zone .",
    "comparisons of the total energy , using a 3 @xmath14 3 @xmath14 3 k - point mesh further established that @xmath15 point sampling of the brillouin zone is sufficient for a quantitative investigation .",
    "zero - point energy calculations were deliberately excluded , not because they were unimportant , but rather because their correct treatment requires and deserves a separate dedicated study .",
    "calculations for higher hydrogen concentrations than [ h / v ] = 1/128 were carried out by randomly distributing hydrogen atoms into the vanadium supercell and calculating the average volume of 50 structures , with different hydrogen distributions .",
    "hydrogen concentrations [ h / v ] of 8/128 ( 5.88 at.% ) , 16/128 ( 11.11 at.% ) , 32/128 ( 20.00 at.% ) and 64/128 ( 33.33 at.% ) were investigated .",
    "this corresponds to a disordered state , mimicking the conditions above the phase boundaries of a @xmath1-phase .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattice vectors were fixed for all calculations , only allowing lattice relaxation in the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the motivation for this approach is to mimic the experimental conditions of hydrogen uptake in a superlattice where the bottom layer of a thin film of vanadium is held in place through strong bonds to a substrate .",
    "this constraint results in a one dimensional lattice expansion , perpendicular to the substrate s plane .",
    "this approach also mimics the bct lattice of the @xmath1 phase when @xmath17 @xmath18 1.1 ( see figure [ ot ] ) .    it is sufficient to consider the strain in one direction , for example the @xmath16-direction , to capture the effect of strain on site occupancy .",
    "this implies also that we can treat the @xmath9 and @xmath10 sites to be equivalent when the hydrogen is occupying @xmath7 sites in the @xmath1-phase .",
    "these are identical in the sense that a rotation by 90@xmath19 around the @xmath16-axis will map the @xmath9 site onto the @xmath10 site and vice versa .",
    "before presenting the results from _ ab initio _ calculations we will provide a conceptual framework for the effect of strain on site occupancy , using a simple hard - sphere model .",
    "we will use this approach to estimate the relative energetics of hydrogen occupation in octahedral and tetrahedral sites , solely based on the available interstitial space in a v single crystal .",
    "the maximum sphere radius that can be accommodated in the interstitial space formed by metal atom spheres arranged in a bcc lattice is 0.155 for octahedral and 0.291 for tetrahedral sites , in units of the metal atom sphere radius . in the atomistic model used here the vanadium",
    "has a wigner - seitz radius of 1.217   and the corresponding value for hydrogen is 0.370   .",
    "an octahedral site in v has therefore @xmath20@xmath21   of spherical radius available , which is much smaller than the hydrogen radius .",
    "a tetrahedral site provides @xmath22@xmath23   , which is close to the hydrogen radius . from this consideration ,",
    "one can see directly that it is not energetically favourable for hydrogen to occupy octahedral sites in an unstrained lattice , because of a large overlap between h and v electrons , raising the total energy through a born - mayer repulsion @xcite . in the tetrahedral sites ,",
    "the corresponding density overlap is much smaller , favouring occupation of tetrahedral sites .",
    "when the lattice is under uniaxial tensile strain ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) the maximum sphere radius that can be accommodated in the @xmath3 and @xmath7 sites is more and more shifted in favour of the @xmath7 sites .",
    "the maximum sphere radius that can be accommodated in @xmath3 and @xmath7 sites becomes equal for @xmath25 .    when the lattice is expanded in the @xmath16-direction the @xmath3 and @xmath7 sites are energetically favored in comparison to their @xmath11 and @xmath12 oriented counterparts .",
    "this is rather obvious for the octahedral sites but not as clear for the tetrahedral sites . for the @xmath7 sites , a tensile strain in the @xmath16-direction will increase the spacing between the vanadium atoms that sit closest to hydrogen , while for @xmath8 sites , the closest vanadium atoms lie in the @xmath26-plane , which are geometrically unaffected by the uniaxial strain in the @xmath16-direction . in the experiments by plsson _",

    "the isotropic strain field from hydrogen occupying a tetrahedral site and the strongly anisotropic strain field from occupying an octahedral site is clearly seen in figure [ strain ] .",
    "the `` top '' and `` bottom '' vanadium atoms in the octahedron ( i.e. , the two vanadium atoms that possess the same @xmath11 and @xmath12 coordinates ) are much closer to the hydrogen than the vanadium atoms in the tetrahedron ; hence , the former are pushed farther away . in the absence of hydrogen",

    "the configurational entropy was determined using boltzmann s entropy formula and the internal energy was approximated as the number of hydrogen atoms in @xmath37-sites times an energy penalty of 0.2 ev ( i.e. , we approximate that moving a hydrogen atom from a @xmath38 site to an @xmath37 site will raise the energy by 0.2 ev , in accordance with the difference in energy between @xmath38 and @xmath37 site occupancy , cf .",

    "the different slopes of @xmath17 as a function of [ h / v ] for tetrahedral ( @xmath3 ) and octahedral ( @xmath7 ) site occupancy has the consequence that the condition for shift in site occupancy is met at different hydrogen concentrations [ h / v ] when starting from high ( @xmath7 ) or low concentration ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this leads to the theoretical prediction of a hysteresis in the hydrogen loading - unloading process , in which the switch from @xmath3 to @xmath7 site occupancy and the reverse switch from @xmath7 to @xmath3 occur at different hydrogen concentrations .",
