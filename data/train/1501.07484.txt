    "moreover , in view of different applications , one may be interested in finding all the elliptic fibrations of a certain type .",
    "the fibrations of rank @xmath3 and maximal torsion lead more easily to the determination of the @xmath4series of the variety @xcite .",
    "those of positive rank lead to symplectic automorphisms of infinite order of the variety .",

    "oguiso used a geometric method to classify elliptic fibrations in @xcite .",
    "some years later , nishiyama @xcite proposed a lattice - theoretic technique to produce such classifications , recovering oguiso s results and classifying other kummer and k3 surfaces .",
    "since then , results of the same type have been obtained by various authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , the work of @xcite described three possible classifications of elliptic fibrations on a k3 surface , shining a new light on the meaning of what is a class of equivalence of elliptic fibrations .",
    "in particular , they proposed a @xmath7-classification of elliptic fibrations up to automorphisms of the surface and a @xmath8-classification of the frame lattices of the fibrations . for our k3 surface ,",
    "the two classifications coincide .",
    "thus , it is particularly interesting to exhibit here an @xmath8-classification by the kneser - nishiyama method , since in general it is not easy to obtain the @xmath7-classification . this topic will be explained in detail in section  [ s : classtype ] .",

    "since , according to @xcite , there is an @xmath9 action on the vertices of polytope 1529 and its polar dual , there is a symplectic action of @xmath9 on @xmath10 this action will be described on specific fibrations .",
    "one of them gives the transcendental lattice @xmath11 we may use these fibrations to relate @xmath0 to a modular elliptic surface analyzed by beauville in @xcite .",

    "more precisely , we obtained @xmath13 elliptic fibrations on @xmath0 , including 17 fibrations of rank @xmath14 and one of rank @xmath15 .    due to the high number of different elliptic fibrations ,",
    "we give only a few cases of computing the torsion .",
    "these cases have been selected to give an idea of the various methods involved .",

    "a generic k3 surface does not admit elliptic fibrations , but if the picard number of the k3 is sufficiently large , it is known that the surface must admit at least one elliptic fibration ( see proposition [ prop : e.f . on x with big rho ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that a k3 surface admits a finite number of elliptic fibrations up to automorphisms ( see proposition [ prop : finite number of e.f . ] ) .",
    "thus , a very natural problem is to classify the elliptic fibrations on a given k3 surface .",
    "this problem has been discussed in several papers , starting in the eighties .",
    "there are essentially two different ways to classify elliptic fibrations on k3 surfaces described in @xcite and @xcite . in some particular cases",
    ", a third method can be applied ; see @xcite .",
    "first , however , we must introduce a different problem :  what does it mean to ` classify ' elliptic fibrations ? \" a deep and interesting discussion of this problem is given in @xcite , where the authors introduce three different types of classifications of elliptic fibrations and prove that under certain ( strong ) conditions these three different classifications collapse to a unique one .",
    "we observe that it was already known by @xcite that in general these three different classifications do not collapse to a unique one .",
    "we now summarize the results by @xcite and the types of classifications .      in this section",
    "we recall some of the main results on elliptic fibrations on k3 surfaces ( for example , compare @xcite ) , and we introduce the different classifications of elliptic fibrations discussed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be a k3 surface and @xmath19 be an elliptic fibration on @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the class of the fiber of @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath22 is a nef divisor which defines the map @xmath29 which sends every point @xmath30 to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a basis of @xmath33 , i.e. a basis of sections of the line bundle associated to the divisor @xmath22 .",
    "the map @xmath34 is the elliptic fibration @xmath20 .",
    "hence , every elliptic fibration on a k3 surface is uniquely associated to an irreducible nef divisor ( with trivial self intersection ) . since @xmath19 admits a section , there exists a rational curve which intersects every fiber in one point .",
    "its class in @xmath35 is denoted by @xmath23 and has the following intersection properties @xmath36 ( since @xmath23 is a rational curve ) and @xmath37 ( since @xmath23 is a section ) . thus , the elliptic fibration @xmath19 ( with a chosen section , as in definition [ def : elliptic fibration ] ) is uniquely associated to a pair of divisors @xmath38 .",
    "this pair of divisors spans a lattice which is isometric to @xmath26 , represented by the matrix @xmath39 $ ] , ( considering the basis @xmath22 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "hence each elliptic fibration is associated to a chosen embedding of @xmath26 in @xmath35 .    on the other hand the following result holds :    ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.13.15))[prop : e.f . on x with big rho ] let @xmath16 be a k3 surface , such that there exists a primitive embedding @xmath41 . then @xmath16 admits an elliptic fibration .",
    "let @xmath16 be a k3 surface with picard number @xmath42 .",
    "then , there is a primitive embedding of @xmath26 in @xmath35 and hence @xmath16 admits at least one elliptic fibration .",
    "a canonical embedding of @xmath43 in @xmath35 is defined as follows : let us denote by @xmath44 and @xmath45 the unique two primitive vectors of @xmath26 with trivial self intersection .",
    "an embedding of @xmath26 in @xmath35 is called _ canonical _ if the image of @xmath44 in @xmath35 is a nef divisor and the image of @xmath46 in @xmath35 is an effective irreducible divisor .    the first naive classification of the elliptic fibrations that one can consider is the classification described above , roughly speaking : two fibrations are different if they correspond to different irreducible nef divisors with trivial self intersections .",
    "this essentially coincides with the classification of the canonical embeddings of @xmath26 in @xmath35 .    following @xcite we call this classification the @xmath27-classification of the elliptic fibrations on @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , it is possible ( and indeed likely , if the picard number is sufficiently large ) that there is an infinite number of irreducible nef divisors with trivial self intersection and also infinitely many copies of @xmath26 canonically embedded in @xmath35 .",
    "thus , it is possible that there is an infinite number of fibrations in curves of genus 1 on @xmath16 and moreover an infinite number of elliptic fibrations on @xmath16 .",
    "the automorphism group of a variety transforms the variety to itself preserving its structure , but moves points and subvarieties on the variety .",
    "thus , if one is considering a variety with a nontrivial automorphism group , one usually classifies objects on the variety up to automorphisms .",
    "let @xmath16 be a k3 surface with a sufficiently large picard number ( at least 2 ) .",
    "then the automorphism group of @xmath16 is in general nontrivial , and it is often of infinite order .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath48 , then the automorphism group of @xmath16 is finite if and only if there is a vector with self intersection either 0 or @xmath49 in the nron  severi group . if @xmath50 , then the automorphism group of @xmath16 is finite if and only if the nron ",
    "severi group is isometric to a lattice contained in a known finite list of lattices , cf .",
    "let us assume that @xmath16 admits more than one elliptic fibration ( up to the @xmath27-classification defined above ) .",
    "this means that there exist at least two elliptic fibrations @xmath19 and @xmath51 such that @xmath52 , where @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) is the class of the fiber of the fibration @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath54 ) . by the previous observation",
    ", it seems very natural to consider @xmath20 and @xmath54 equivalent if there exists an automorphism of @xmath16 which sends @xmath20 to @xmath55 .",
    "this is the idea behind the @xmath47-classification of the elliptic fibrations introduced in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath47-classification of the elliptic fibrations on a k3 surface is the classification of elliptic fibrations up to automorphisms of the surface . to be more precise : @xmath20 is @xmath47-equivalent to @xmath54 if and only if there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "we observe that if two elliptic fibrations on a k3 surface are equivalent up to automorphism , then all their geometric properties ( the type and the number of singular fibers , the properties of the mordell  weil group and the intersection properties of the sections ) coincide .",
    "this is true essentially by definition , since an automorphism preserves all the `` geometric '' properties of subvarieties on @xmath16 .",
    "the advantages of the @xmath47-classification with respect to the @xmath27-classification are essentially two .",
    "the first is more philosophical : in several contexts , to classify an object on varieties means to classify the object up to automorphisms of the variety .",
    "the second is more practical and is based on an important result by sterk : the @xmath47-classification must have a finite number of classes :    @xcite[prop : finite number of e.f . ] up to automorphisms , there exists a finite number of elliptic fibrations on a k3 surface .",
    "the main problem of the @xmath47-classification is that it is difficult to obtain a @xmath47-classification of elliptic fibrations on k3 surfaces , since it is in general difficult to give a complete description of the automorphism group of a k3 surface and the orbit of divisors under this group .",
    "an intermediate classification can be introduced , the @xmath58-classification .",
    "the @xmath58-classification is not as fine as the @xmath47-classification , and its geometric meaning is not as clear as the meanings of the classifications introduced above .",
    "however , the @xmath58-classification can be described in a very natural way in the context of lattice theory , and there is a standard method to produce it .    since the @xmath58-classification is essentially the classification of certain lattices strictly related to the elliptic fibrations , we recall here some definitions and properties of lattices related to an elliptic fibration .",
    "we have already observed that every elliptic fibration on @xmath16 is associated to an embedding @xmath59 .",
    "the orthogonal complement of @xmath60 in @xmath35 , @xmath61 , is denoted by @xmath62 and called the frame lattice of @xmath20 .    the frame lattice of @xmath20 encodes essentially all the geometric properties of @xmath20 , as we explain now .",
    "we recall that the irreducible components of the reducible fibers which do not meet the zero section generate a root lattice , which is the direct sum of certain dynkin diagrams .",
    "let us consider the root lattice @xmath63 of @xmath62 .",
    "then the lattice @xmath63 is exactly the direct sum of the dynkin diagram corresponding to the reducible fibers . to be more precise if the lattice @xmath64 ( resp .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) is a summand of the lattice @xmath63 , then the fibration @xmath20 admits a fiber of type @xmath71 ( resp .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , the lattices @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be associated to two different types of reducible fibers , i.e. to @xmath78 and @xmath79 and to @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "we can not distinguish between these two different cases using lattice theory .",
    "moreover , the singular non - reducible fibers of an elliptic fibration can be either of type @xmath82 or of type @xmath83 .",
    "given an elliptic fibration @xmath20 on a k3 surface @xmath16 , the lattice @xmath84 is often called the _ trivial lattice _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8.3 ) for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "let us now consider the mordell  weil group of an elliptic fibration @xmath20 on a k3 surface @xmath16 : its properties are also encoded in the frame @xmath62 , indeed @xmath85 . in particular , @xmath86 @xmath87 where , for every sublattice @xmath88 , @xmath89 denotes the primitive closure of @xmath90 in @xmath35 , i.e.@xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath58-classification of elliptic fibrations on a k3 surface is the classification of their frame lattices .",
    "it appears now clear that if two elliptic fibrations are identified by the @xmath58-classification , they have the same trivial lattice and the same mordell ",
    "weil group ( since these objects are uniquely determined by the frame of the elliptic fibration ) .",
    "we observe that if @xmath20 and @xmath54 are identified by the @xmath47-classification , then there exists an automorphism @xmath92 , such that @xmath57 .",
    "the automorphism @xmath93 induces an isometry @xmath94 on @xmath35 and it is clear that @xmath95 is an isometry . thus the elliptic fibrations @xmath20 and @xmath54 have isometric frame lattices and so are @xmath58-equivalent .    the @xmath58-classification is not as fine as the @xmath47-classification ; indeed , if @xmath96 is an isometry , a priori there is no reason to conclude that there exists an automorphism @xmath92 such that @xmath97 ; indeed comparing the @xmath47-classification given in @xcite and the @xmath58-classification given in @xcite for the kummer surface of the product of two non - isogenous elliptic curves , one can check that the first one is more fine than the second one .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath58-classification sits in its strong relation with the lattice theory ; indeed , there is a method which allows one to obtain the @xmath58-classification of elliptic fibration on several k3 surfaces .",
    "this method is presented in @xcite and will be described in this paper in section [ sec : details ] .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite is about the relations among the various types of classifications of elliptic fibrations on k3 surfaces .",
    "first we observe that there exists two surjective maps @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which are in fact quotient maps ( cf .",

    "this induces a map @xmath100 which is not necessarily a quotient map .",

    "the first paper about the classification of elliptic fibrations on k3 surfaces is due to oguiso , @xcite .",
    "he gives a @xmath47-classification of the elliptic fibrations on the kummer surface of the product of two non - isogenous elliptic curves .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite is very geometric : it is strictly related to the presence of a certain automorphism ( a non ",
    "symplectic involution ) on the k3 surface . since one has to require that the k3 surface admits this special automorphism , the method suggested in @xcite can be generalized only to certain special k3 surfaces ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "seven years after the paper @xcite , a different method was proposed by nishiyama in @xcite .",
    "this method is less geometric and more related to the lattice structure of the k3 surfaces and of the elliptic fibrations .",
    "nishiyama applied this method in order to obtain a @xmath58-classification of the elliptic fibrations , both on the k3 surface already considered in @xcite and on other k3 surfaces ( cyclic quotients of the product of two special elliptic curves ) to which the method by oguiso can not be applied . later , in @xcite ,",
    "the method is used to give a @xmath58-classification of elliptic fibrations on a k3 surface whose transcendental lattice is @xmath115 .",
    "the main idea of nishiyama s method is the following : we consider a k3 surface @xmath16 and its transcendental lattice @xmath116 .",
    "then we consider a lattice @xmath117 such that : @xmath117 is negative definite ; @xmath118 ; the discriminant group and form of @xmath117 are the same as the ones of @xmath116 .",
    "we consider primitive embeddings of @xmath119 , where @xmath90 is a niemeier lattice .",
    "the orthogonal complement of @xmath120 in @xmath90 is in fact the frame of an elliptic fibration on @xmath16 .",
    "the classification of the primitive embeddings of @xmath117 in @xmath90 for every niemeier lattice @xmath90 coincides with the @xmath58-classification of the elliptic fibrations on @xmath16",
    ". we will give more details on nishiyama s method in section [ sec : details ] .",
    "since this method is related only to the lattice properties of the surface , a priori one can not expect to find a @xmath47-classification by using only this method .",
    "thanks to corollary [ cor : j2=j1 ] , ( see @xcite ) the results obtained by nishiyama s method are sometimes stronger than expected . in particular , we will see that in our case ( as in the case described in @xcite ) the classification that we obtain for the elliptic fibrations on a certain k3 surface using the nishiyama s method , is in fact a @xmath47-classification ( and not only a @xmath58-classification ) .      in section [ sec : explicit computations ] , we will classify elliptic fibrations on a certain k3 surface , determining both the trivial lattice and the mordell  weil group .",
    "a priori , steps ( 8) and ( 9 ) of the algorithm presented in [ sec : details ] completely determine the mordell  weil group . in any case",
    ", we can deduce some information on the torsion part of the mordell  weil group by considering only the properties of the reducible fibers of the elliptic fibration .",
    "this makes the computation easier , so here we collect some results on the relations between the reducible fibers of a fibration and the torsion part of the mordell  weil group .",
    "first , we recall that a section meets every fiber in exactly one smooth point , so a section meets every reducible fiber in one point of a component with multiplicity 1 ( we recall that the fibers of type @xmath121 , @xmath71 , @xmath73 , @xmath72 have reducible components with multiplicity greater than 1 )",
    ". we will call the component of a reducible fiber which meets the zero section the _ zero component _ or _",
    "trivial component_.    every section ( being a rational point of an elliptic curve defined over @xmath122 ) induces an automorphism of every fiber , in particular of every reducible fiber .",
    "thus , the presence of an @xmath123-torsion section implies that all the reducible fibers of the fibration admits @xmath124 as subgroup of the automorphism group .",
    "in particular , this implies the following ( well known ) result :    ( cf .",
    "* section 7.2))[prop : torsion and reducible fibers ] let @xmath19 be an elliptic fibration and let @xmath125 the torsion part of the mordell  weil group .    if there is a fiber of type @xmath71 , then @xmath126 .",
