    "the residual entropy of ice was first calculated in a classic paper by pauling.@xcite this entropy arises from the fact that an oxygen atom in ice is surrounded by four protons .",
    "any two of them can move in close to it , making up the @xmath4 unit , while the other two stay away becoming part of the neighboring water molecules .",
    "extensive ground state entropy is a hallmark of highly frustrated systems , and is well appreciated in context of ising models , at least since the exact solution of the triangular - lattice antiferromagnet.@xcite a direct connection between the entropy of ice and ground state entropy of ising spin models was first shown by anderson.@xcite accurate calculations of thermodynamic properties of systems with extensive ground state degeneracy@xcite remains a challenging task .",
    "interest in such systems has grown considerably with the discovery of spin - ice materials.@xcite these are pyrochlore - lattice spin systems with strong uniaxial anisotropy . in each tetrahedron of the lattice ,",
    "two spins point in and two point out , providing an exact realization of anderson s spin - ice mapping . in the real materials ,",
    "the spin - ice states arise from a combination of nearest - neighbor exchange and long - range dipolar interactions.@xcite due to the unusual angles between the easy - axis directions at neighboring sites , antiferromagnetic exchange leads to a lower energy for all - in / all - out configurations in a tetrahedron , while ferromagnetic exchange leads to the two - in / two - out spin - ice configurations .",
    "the measured residual entropy , in these systems , is in good agreement with the pauling value.@xcite    in this paper , our focus is the study of an ising antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice , which from a statistical mechanics point of view is equivalent to a ferromagnetically exchange coupled spin - ice material .",
    "it is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 here the spins @xmath6 take values @xmath7 and the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor bonds of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "single tetrahedron based approximations for the thermodynamic properties of this model are common.@xcite we note that single tetrahedron based approximation for residual entropy is not the same as the entropy of a single tetrahedron .",
    "translating pauling s argument to the spin language , each spin has two states , but in each tetrahedron only @xmath8 out of @xmath1 spin configurations obey the ice - rules . treating the constraint in each tetrahedron as independent",
    ", a system with @xmath9 spins has @xmath10 ground states , where @xmath11 is number of tetrahedra . since , @xmath11 equals @xmath12 , this leads to a ground state entropy per spin of @xmath13 .",
    "corrections to the pauling expression for residual entropy of ice have been studied before.@xcite following earlier work by takahashi@xcite and dimargio and stillinger,@xcite nagle used graphical methods on vertex models@xcite to study ground state residual entropy for cubic ice corresponding to the pyrochlore lattice as well as the more common ice structure known as layered hexagonal ice .",
    "he found that the difference in residual entropy between the two structures was negilgible .",
    "the corrections to the pauling expression was estimated to be about @xmath14 percent .",
    "comparable corrections ( approximately @xmath15 percent ) have been estimated in more recent computational studies.@xcite here , we will calculate the thermodynamic properties of the antiferromagnetic ising model on the pyrochlore lattice using series expansion methods.@xcite    in a numerical linked cluster expansion ( nlc),@xcite an extensive property @xmath16 for a large lattice @xmath17 of n - sites is expressed as @xmath18 the sum is over distinct clusters of the lattice .",
    "@xmath19 is the lattice constant of the cluster , given by the number of embeddings of the cluster in the lattice , per site .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the weight of the cluster associated with the property @xmath16 , which is defined by the subgraph subtraction scheme @xmath21 where the sum runs over all subclusters of the cluster @xmath22 .",
    "thus , to carry out the calculation up to some order , one needs a count of all the clusters up to some order , and the property @xmath23 needs to be calculated for every cluster to high precision using numerical methods .",
    "the number of clusters , needed in the study , is significantly reduced if it can be shown that only star - graphs contribute.@xcite consider a graph as a collection of sites that are connected pair - wise by the bonds of the graph .",
    "a site is a point of articulation in a graph , if cutting all the bonds incident on the site , makes the rest of the graph disconnected .",
    "a star - graph is one that has no such articulation site .",
    "star graph expansions have been used to develop high temperature expansions for various classical spin models.@xcite but , they can also be used in a numerical linked cluster ( nlc ) scheme , where no small expansion parameter is needed.@xcite rather , thermodynamic properties of finite clusters can be calculated at a given temperature and then the principle of inclusion and exclusion can be used to calculate the thermodynamic property of the infinite system by summing up contributions from all allowed clusters .",
    "a star graph expansion requires that all articulated graphs have zero weight .",
    "this is very simple to see for properties that can be obtained from the logarithm of the zero - field partition function .",
    "for any articulated graph , one can show that a partition function , that is normalized to unity in the absence of interactions , becomes a product of partition functions over the two subgraphs articulated at a point .",
    "hence @xmath24 becomes a sum .",
    "thus for an articulated graph c made up of parts a and b , which only share a point of articulation , the property satisfies @xmath25 this is enough to ensure that after subgraph subtraction the articulated graph has zero weight .",
    "it is a little harder to see how to develop star - graph expansion for the uniform susceptibility .",
    "one needs to consider the matrix @xmath26 with elements@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are sites of the cluster and angular brackets denote thermal expectation values .",
    "one can show that for a graph articulated at site @xmath30 into parts @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( with spin normalization @xmath33 ) @xmath34 when @xmath28 and @xmath29 belong to @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "and within a and b , the correlations remain the same as in the subcluster .",
    "this can be used to further show that@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath26 , has a star graph expansion .",
    "furthermore , for the infinite lattice , this is related to the inverse of the uniform structure factor , or temperature times the uniform susceptibility by the relation , @xmath37     ( color online ) first two star - graphs of the pyrochlore lattice made up of complete tetrahedra .",
    "the first one is a single tetrahedron .",
    "the second is a ring of six tetrahedra that alternately point in and out of the board ( denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 signs ) .",
    ", width=226 ]    in a lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra , it is natural to consider an nlc expansion scheme , in which all interactions are grouped into tetrahedra .",
    "thus , apart from a single site , all graphs are made up of complete tetrahedra .",
    "this scheme is particularly useful because the tetrahedra are joined at corners in the lattice . in a graph with two tetrahedra , the site where they are joined becomes a point of articulation .",
    "cutting all the bonds at that site makes the graph disconnected .",
    "thus , in a star - graph expansion , the two - tetrahedron graph makes no contribution .",
    "it also means that the single tetrahedron approximation becomes exact on a husimi tree of tetrahedra,@xcite where there are no other closed loops of tetrahedra .",
    "the tetrahedra of a pyrochlore lattice are known to form a diamond lattice .",
    "thus any graph counting problem involving tetrahedra is equivalent to counting graphs on the diamond lattice , where sites of the diamond lattice represent tetrahedra while bonds of the diamond lattice represent shared sites between neighboring tetrahedra .",
    "all star graphs on the diamond lattice up to @xmath1 bonds have been listed by sykes _",
    "et al_.@xcite we will make use of these to calculate the expansions to @xmath1-th order .",
    "one should note that all lattice constants of the diamond lattice need to be divided by @xmath40 , because the number of tetrahedra is @xmath41 the number of sites in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "we illustrate how the method works by showing the first two orders of the calculation for the ground state entropy ( with the boltzmann constant @xmath42 ) . the first two star - graphs with complete tetrahedra are shown in fig .",
    "1 . they have a lattice constant per site of the pyrochlore lattice of @xmath41 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "one also needs to consider a single - site , which provides all contributions before any interactions are included .",
    "it has a count of unity .    for our illustration",
    ", the ground state entropy is the property @xmath16 . in zeroth order",
    ", the single site has two ground states , giving an entropy of @xmath44 .",
    "it has no subgraphs .",
    "hence , its weight is also @xmath44 .",
    "the first star graph , a single tetrahedron , has @xmath8 ground states .",
    "hence the property @xmath16 for the graph equals @xmath45 . to obtain its weight",
    ", one must subtract the weights of the 4 sites .",
    "thus the weight of the single tetrahedron is @xmath46 thus , to first order the ground state entropy , per site , for the infinite system is @xmath47 note that the factor of @xmath41 in front of @xmath48 is the count of number of tetrahedra per lattice site , which is one - half .",
    "this is the pauling answer .",
    "the next star graph is a graph of @xmath8 tetrahedra ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "it has 730 ground states .",
    "it has @xmath8 single tetrahedron subgraphs and 18 sites .",
    "thus , its weight is @xmath49 thus , to this order , the entropy per site , becomes @xmath50    these first corrections are analogous to triangle - based nlc calculations done by rigol et al for the kagome lattice.@xcite in that case , the pauling expression for ground state entropy is @xmath51 . adding the next correction brought the entropy to @xmath52 , much closer to known exact answer of",
    "approximately @xmath53.@xcite because the count of longer loops increases much more rapidly in a 3-dimensional lattice , a high order calculation is needed to assess the corrections more accurately .",
    "here we have done only the first corrections for the uniform susceptibility , but a @xmath1-th order correction for the entropy and specific heat .",
    "high temperature series expansions for this system were derived some years ago : to order @xmath54 for @xmath24 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and to order @xmath1 for @xmath55.@xcite we have reanalyzed these series using pad and d - log pad approximants to yield the series results for comparison at high temperatures .    fig .",
    "2 shows a plot of the entropy .",
    "the single tetrahedra approximation is denoted nlc-1 .",
    "nlc-6 includes the next order correction .",
    "nlc-16 gives the result up to 16th order .",
    "3 shows the corresponding plots of the heat capacity .",
    "4 shows plots of the uniform susceptibility .",
    "the high temperature expansions converge really well only above a temperature of @xmath40 .",
    "note that the spins are normalized to be @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature scale would be four times lower if they were normalized to @xmath56 .    in all cases ,",
    "the single tetrahedron based approximation is quite accurate .",
    "let us define percent correction for the three quantities @xmath57 entropy ( @xmath58 ) , heat capacity ( @xmath22 ) and susceptibility ( @xmath55 ) as @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the quantity after @xmath9th order nlc .",
    "and @xmath61 is the property with only the one tetrahedron cluster . a plot of @xmath62 with temperature is shown in fig .",
    "the largest corrections are near @xmath63 .",
    "they are a little over one percent for the entropy and about @xmath64 percent for the specific heat",
    ".    at @xmath63 , our graphical scheme , reduces to one of counting ground states on increasingly larger clusters .",
    "while this scheme is not identical to the one used by nagle,@xcite it is closely related . as found by nagle , the first few orders give the same answer for the cubic and layered hexagonal structures of ice .",
    "we also find that the first corrections to the pauling entropy are identical for the two lattices .",
    "since , our interest is in the pyrochlore lattice spin model , we have not studied the layered hexagonal structure in higher orders .",
    "( color online ) percentage correction to the quantities , entropy ( @xmath65 ) , heat capacity ( @xmath66 ) and susceptibility ( @xmath67 ) after @xmath8th and @xmath1th order nlc calculations ( denoted by the numbers @xmath8 and @xmath1 in the legends ) .",
    ", width=264 ]    in conclusion , we have used a star - graph expansion scheme to show that the pauling approximation for the entropy of ice and calculation of other properties of the pyrochlore lattice ising model based on a single tetrahedron is really a first term in a numerical linked cluster ( nlc ) scheme . in the corner sharing lattice , this scheme is highly accurate .",
    "we have calculated corrections to the single tetrahedron approximations and found them to be at most a few percent for different thermodynamic quantities .",
    "these ideas of star - graph expansions are also valid for continuous spin models , where also single tetrahedra based schemes have been used successfully.@xcite however , it should be noted that finite - size calculations of properties of the continuous spin systems can be a non - trivial task .",
    "star graph expansions are also valid in presence of dilution and quenched disorder.@xcite star graph expansions are not valid for quantum spin models and hence all connected clusters of tetrahedra need to be included in these cases ."
