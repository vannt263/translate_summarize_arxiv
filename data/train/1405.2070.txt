    "a substantial fraction of stars in clusters are not gravitationally bound to any particular galaxy .",
    "these stars constitute the so - called intra - cluster light .",
    "the icl is distributed around the central galaxy of the cluster and extends to several hundred kpc away from the cluster center ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this diffuse light is thought to form primarily by the tidal stripping of stars from galaxies which interact and merge during the hierarchical accretion history of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the characterization of the icl provides a direct way of determining the assembly mechanisms occurring inside galaxy clusters . in this sense ,",
    "the icl is the signature of how violent the assembly of the cluster has been through its cosmic history .",
    "for that reason , it is absolutely key determining how and when the icl formed .",
    "however , the identification of this light observationally remains difficult and uncertain .",
    "indeed , the typical surface brightness of the icl is @xmath13 mag / arcsec@xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is contaminated by foreground and background galaxies . moreover ,",
    "it is difficult to dissociate between the icl and the brightest central galaxy surface brightness profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the properties of the stellar populations of the icl provide a vital tool to understand its formation , little is known about their characteristics .",
    "the icl is reported to be metal - poor in some studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while other studies show super - solar metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simulations predict that the icl forms very late ( @xmath8 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the bulk of the icl is produced by the most massive ( m@xmath15 m@xmath10 ) satellites as they fall into the cluster core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if this scenario is correct , the ages and metallicities of the intracluster population will be highly dependent on the progenitor galaxies from which they were stripped .",
    "therefore , the icl is expected to have a metallicity that is similar to that of these massive satellites .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore this question in detail and characterize , for the first time , the age and metallicity of the icl of a massive cluster at radial distances r@xmath16 kpc with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "we achieve our goal taking advantage of the deepest optical and near - infrared images ever taken by the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) of the abell cluster 2744 .",
    "the hubble frontier fields ( hff ) project represents the largest investment of hst time for deep observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "abell 2744 is the first cluster observed as part of the hff program .",
    "this structure , at @xmath0 @xcite , is a rich cluster ( virial mass of @xmath17 m@xmath10 within @xmath18 mpc ) undergoing a major merger as evidenced by its complex internal structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , this cluster represents an excellent target for studying the formation of the icl .",
    "the ages and metallicities of the icl are studied in detail taking advantage of the inclusion of very deep near - infrared ( nir ) data to break the age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a standard cosmological model with the following parameters : @xmath19=70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21=0.3 and @xmath22=0.7 . at @xmath0 ,",
    "this corresponds to a spatial scale of @xmath23 kpc / arcsec .",
    "the data used in this work are based on the first release of the hff program and include all the nir wfc3 data ( id13495 , pi : j. lotz and id13386 , pi : s. rodney ) of abell 2744 .",
    "the acs images were taken from the hst archive as part of the program : id11689 ( pi : r. dupke ) and consist of six orbits in f435w and five orbits each in f606w and f814w .",
    "nir observations include imaging in four filters f105w , f125w , f140w , f160w based on 24 , 12 , 10 , and 24 orbits , respectively .",
    "the data were directly retrieved from the archive .",
    "the images were reduced by the hff team following standard hst procedures both for the acs and wfc3 data . for both cameras , flat fields",
    "are claimed to be accurate to better than @xmath24 across the detector .",
    "a few of the hff observations in the ir exhibit a time - variable sky background signal due to time variable atmospheric emission .",
    "this exposures were corrected from this variable emission and included into the final mosaics ( koekemoer 2014 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "the mosaics we used consist on drizzled science images with pixel size @xmath25 .",
    "these mosaics were build using the package astrodrizzle . in the case of the wfc3 ,",
    "this pixel size is closer to one half of an original pixel . while working with subpixel dithered data",
    "has several advantages as helping to the comic ray rejection step , improving the resolution and lowering the correlated noise , it also reduces the sensitivity to low surface brightness features . this last problem ,",
    "however , can be avoided by combining several pixels later on as we have done in our work ( see next section ) .",
    "the @xmath26diameter aperture depth at @xmath27 of each image is : @xmath28 ( f435w ) , @xmath29 ( f606w ) , @xmath30 ( f814w ) , @xmath31 ( f105w ) , @xmath32 ( f125w ) , @xmath33 ( f140w ) and @xmath34 ( f160w ) mag @xcite .",
    "as we will explain later , the age and metallicity of the icl is determined using the color information provided by both cameras : acs and wfc3 .",
    "consequently , we will limit our study of the icl to their common field of view ( @xmath35 arcmin@xmath14 ) of the galaxy cluster .",
    "our goal is to study the properties of the stellar populations of abell 2744 down to the faintest surface brightness possible .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to measure accurately the colors of the stellar populations across the cluster . given that the acs images are shallower than the wfc3 data , we have spatially re - binned the images of the hff to improve the s / n and to maximize the detection of the diffuse light of the cluster .",
    "previous to the rebinning , we have smoothed the images with a @xmath36 pixel median box filter to reduce noise , specially in the outer regions of the cluster .",
    "the new rebinned pixel value is the sum of @xmath37 input pixels in the original image and has a size of @xmath38(@xmath39 kpc at z@xmath40 ) .",
    "the process of smoothing and rebinning the images is flux conserving .",
    "we have estimated the surface brightness limits of our images as follows .",
    "we have identified @xmath41 background regions spread over the outer parts of the images .",
    "the background regions are chosen to avoid the contamination of the light of the cluster . with this aim",
    "we have selected areas with @xmath42 mag / arcsec@xmath14 , @xmath43 m@xmath44/pc@xmath14 and @xmath45 kpc ( see section [ parameters ] ) .",
    "we have explored whether the light distribution in the background area follows a normal distribution .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that a gaussian distribution is compatible with the data ( the null hypothesis is not rejected with any statistical significance ) .",
    "we do not find any evidence supporting that our background distributions present gradients .    to estimate the surface brightness limits , we calculated the r.m.s of the images on boxes of @xmath46 arcsec@xmath14 ( equivalent to @xmath47 kpc@xmath14 at the cluster redshift ) .",
    "the surface brightness limits we provide correspond to @xmath48 detections .",
    "these limits are : @xmath49 ( f435w ) , @xmath50 ( f606w ) , @xmath51 ( f814w ) , @xmath52 ( f105w ) , @xmath53 ( f125w ) , @xmath54 ( f140w ) and @xmath55 ( f160w ) mag / arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "although the hff data is sky substracted , in order to have a better sky determination , we have used the above regions to reestimate the background of each of the images and subtracted ( added ) it to the whole image .",
    "finally , for the analysis of the icl , it is crucial to identify the galaxies that are members of the cluster and get rid of background and foreground sources . for this purpose",
    ", we build a redshift mask of the cluster image .",
    "the mask was constructed using the spectroscopic redshift catalog of @xcite and adding all the photometric redshifts available in ned . to assign a redshift value to the pixels of the images , first we run sextractor in the f160w image to identify the area that correspond to each object , using a detection threshold at a 5@xmath56 significance level and a gaussian convolution kernel with size @xmath57 .",
    "then , we masked the area subtended by those objects whose redshifts do not correspond to the cluster ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) and also those without measured redshifts .",
    "the uncertainties at determining the surface brightness limits of the images reflect how accurate we can estimate the background level .",
    "we have quantified how these uncertainties affect the determination of the fluxes in the icl region of our images .",
    "as we will see later , we define the icl as the region of the cluster with restframe surface brightness 24@xmath6025 mag / arcsec@xmath14 . placing in this region a @xmath46 arcsec@xmath14 box",
    ", we measured the flux in it .",
    "this icl flux was then compared with the uncertainties at the determination of the background .",
    "we find that the previous background uncertainties translate into the following errors on the different bands fluxes in our icl bin : @xmath61% ( f435w ) , @xmath62% ( f606w ) , @xmath63%(f814w ) , @xmath26% ( f105w ) , @xmath38% ( f125w ) , @xmath26% ( f140w ) and @xmath64% ( f160w ) .",
    "as expected , the errors are larger for our acs filters , which have shallower exposures , than for our wfc3 filters .",
    "however , it is worth noting , that our work only uses data based on bands redder than f606w",
    ". consequently , the uncertainties at measuring the background level only affect the fluxes in the icl region below 5% in all cases . this little effect , particularly in the nir bands , is expected because our surface brightness limit to study the icl is well above ( @xmath65 mag ) the limiting surface brightness of our imaging .",
    "this guarantee that we are working in a surface brightness regime less affected by problems of flat fielding , incorrect sky subtraction , etc . in table",
    "[ table2 ] , we summarize the sources of noise that can affect our measurements .",
    "2.5pt    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to study the stellar populations of the cluster , including its icl , we constructed two restframe colors at the redshift of the cluster : @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the choice of these colors was made for two reasons : first , to diminish the effects of the different psfs combining images from the same camera ( acs data for @xmath66 and wfc3 data for @xmath67 ) and second , to include a nir filter to constrain the metallicity with better accuracy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the colors were built interpolating among the observed filters to obtain the flux in the equivalent restframe bands : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we also derived the @xmath72 band , using the same methodology , to construct the @xmath73 color .",
    "this color was used to create a measurement of the stellar mass density of the cluster ( see below ) .",
    "we corrected our data of galactic extinction ( e(b - v)=@xmath74 , @xcite ) using a @xcite extinction law .    to explore the stellar populations of abell 2744 and their variation across the cluster structure",
    ", we make use of three independent analysis based on different parameters : the restframe ( corrected of cosmological dimming ) surface brightness in @xmath71-band , @xmath75 , the logarithm of the stellar mass density , @xmath76 , and the radial distance , @xmath77 , to the most massive galaxies of the cluster . these three parameters will allow us to compare our results with theoretical expectations .",
    "the @xmath75 map of the cluster was divided in eight surface brightness bins , from @xmath78 to @xmath37 mag / arcsec@xmath14 . to estimate @xmath76",
    ", we follow the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "first , we link the stellar mass density profile @xmath79 with the surface brightness profile at a given wavelength @xmath80 using the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio .",
    "this is done with the expression :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the absolute magnitude of the sun at wavelength @xmath83 and @xmath79 is measured in m@xmath10 pc@xmath84 .",
    "second , to evaluate the above expression , we need to obtain the m / l ratio at each radius . following the prescription of @xcite",
    ", we have calculated the m / l ratio as a function of color . in this work",
    "we have used the restframe color @xmath73 and assumed a salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "the expression we have used to estimate the m / l is :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 , @xmath87=-0.041 and @xmath88=0.463 are applied to determine the m / l in the z - band .",
    "the @xmath76 map of the cluster was divided also in eight mass density bins , from @xmath89 to @xmath90 m@xmath10/pc@xmath14 .",
    "finally , we constructed a _ radial distance _ indicator using the centers of the most massive galaxies in the cluster as the starting points .",
    "these massive galaxies were identified as those galaxies with central surface brightness @xmath91 mag / arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "this surface brightness translates to a density of @xmath92 m@xmath44/pc@xmath14 equivalent to the stellar mass densities in the centers of massive ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "then , the distance to their centers was calculated as the elliptical distance defined by the morphological parameters of these galaxies , derived by sextractor .",
    "the less massive galaxies of the cluster were masked to reduce the contamination of their different stellar populations at a given radius .",
    "this radial distance was logarithmic spaced in eight bins , from @xmath93 to @xmath94 kpc .",
    "we illustrate the different bins in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the reason to choose the above parameters , and their binning , is to characterize the stellar populations of the cluster properly , i.e. averaging zones with similar properties .",
    "this allows us to describe the cluster from its inner parts ( brighter magnitudes , higher densities ) to its outer parts ( fainter magnitudes , lower densities ) in a consistent way . on doing this ,",
    "the comparison of the icl properties with those from the cluster galaxies is direct and homogeneous .",
    "consequently , we will infer the properties of the icl and cluster galaxies based on their relative differences .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the three color - color diagrams based on the @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 maps of the cluster are shown ( left panels ) .",
    "a grid of @xcite models based on a salpeter imf for single stellar populations is also plotted .",
    "each of the points of the grid is flagged with its corresponding age and metallicity . for illustration , in the right panels",
    ", the color - coded bins of the three parameters are drawn over an image of the cluster in the f160w band .",
    "the left panels of fig . [ fig1 ] show the color - color diagrams for each parameter used to characterize the cluster light , i.e. @xmath75 , @xmath95 and @xmath77 .",
    "each data point on the color - color diagram corresponds to the average restframe @xmath66 and @xmath67 color values of the spatial regions drawn in the cluster maps plotted in the right panels .",
    "the errors in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 colors are derived from bootstrapping simulations .",
    "these simulations consist of @xmath96 realizations randomly choosing half of the pixels in each bin and calculating their mean colors .",
    "the errors represent the scatter of the distributions of the means .",
    "these errors account for both the intrinsic scatter of the cluster s stellar populations and the photometric errors .",
    "in addition , this bootstrapping technique could also account for local variations in the flat - field of the images .",
    "for all the color - color diagrams , a continuous bluing of both @xmath66 and @xmath67 colors is clearly seen . therefore , the stellar populations of the cluster ( galaxies and icl ) become gradually bluer when moving away from the centers of the galaxies ( i.e. , towards fainter luminosities and lower densities ) . according to the values of age and metallicity indicated by the grid of models , this gradient in colors",
    "is compatible with a gradient in metallicity , from a supersolar metallicity to a little subsolar , and also a slight gradient in age ( see next subsection ) .",
    "it is worth noting a slightly discrepant point ( @xmath97 ) at @xmath98 kpc in the radial distance plot .",
    "we think this discrepant point is due to a combination of low statistics and mixing of different stellar populations at that radius .",
    "a potential source of concern in our color determination is the effect of the psf on the color distribution .",
    "consequently , it is important to quantify a possible contamination of the colors in the outer regions of the cluster due to the scattered light produced by the different band psfs .",
    "we have quantified this effect by modeling the effect of the different band psfs in a model galaxy without and with a modeled icl component .",
    "this is described in the appendix .",
    "we find that the effect of the psf both for the @xmath66 and @xmath67 colors is small ( less than @xmath99 and @xmath100 mag , respectively , at the region of the icl , i.e. @xmath101 kpc ) and less than @xmath102 mag when adding an icl component .",
    "moreover , if any , the psf effect on the color profile tends to redden the color . as we are observing a continuous bluing of the color radial profile ,",
    "we conclude that the effect of the psf plays a minor role in our analysis .      to quantify the changes of the stellar populations across the galaxy cluster , we have computed the age and metallicity of the stellar populations based on their restframe @xmath66 and @xmath67 colors . within each spatial bin",
    ", we measure the age and the metallicity of each pixel corresponding to their @xmath66 and @xmath67 colors . then",
    ", we estimate the corresponding mean age and metallicity .",
    "the errors in age and metallicity were also drawn from the bootstrapping simulations used to derive the color errors .",
    "the gradients of age ( upper panels ) and metallicity ( bottom panels ) for each of the parameters are shown in fig .",
    "the colors , ages and metallicities for the three parameters are listed in table [ table1 ] .        in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , tentatively , we marked in orange the region corresponding to the icl component .",
    "observationally , the exact definition of which part of the cluster light describes the icl is ill - defined .",
    "there have been many different attempts to label the icl region using criteria as the surface brightness or the radial distance .",
    "for instance , @xcite defined the icl as the light with @xmath103 mag / arcsec@xmath14 whereas @xcite used @xmath101 kpc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each of the parameters used",
    ", we have defined the icl region as the region with either restframe @xmath104 mag / arcsec@xmath14 , @xmath105 or @xmath101 kpc .",
    "the @xmath75 limit defining the icl region is based on the zibetti et al .",
    "definition and was calculated using @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and @xmath107 ( * ? ? ? * for solar metallicity and @xmath108 gyr ) while the @xmath76 limit is calculated using the above @xmath75 limit and the color @xmath106 .",
    "these values are inserted into equation 1 in @xcite with the mass to light ratio in the @xmath71-band given by @xcite models for the corresponding age ( @xmath108 gyr ) and metallicity ( @xmath109 ) of the icl region .    according to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the metallicity within the cluster is continuously decreasing from supersolar ( @xmath110 ) in the central part of the main galaxies to solar ( @xmath5 ) in the icl region .",
    "the icl metallicity is similar to that found in the stellar halo of nearby massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the stellar population ages show a slight negative gradient towards the outskirts .",
    "this gradient is compatible with what is found for the giant elliptical galaxy m87 @xcite , the elliptical galaxies in @xcite and for some galaxies in @xcite .",
    "state - of - the - art semianalytical models of galaxy formation ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the origin of the icl is the result of the disruption and tidal stripping of massive ( @xmath111 m@xmath10 ) satellite galaxies infalling in the cluster potential ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the largest contribution of these massive satellites to the icl is understood due to the stronger effect of dynamical friction on these galaxies orbiting the cluster compared to less massive satellites .",
    "if this theoretical scenario is correct , we would expect that the mean metallicity of the icl would be slightly subsolar z@xmath112 ( @xcite , corresponding to the typical metallicities of the galaxies described above ) . here we find that the mean metallicity of the icl in our cluster is solar ( @xmath5 ) , but still in agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "using the mass - metallicity relation @xcite , the derived icl metallicity corresponds to the metallicities of galaxies with m@xmath113 3@xmath11410@xmath115 m@xmath10 .",
    "this mass is only a factor of two different to that of the milky way and the metallicity is similar ( @xmath116 m@xmath10 , @xcite ; @xmath117 , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the icl of abell 2744 can be understood as mainly produced by the disruption of galaxies with similar stellar properties as the milky way .",
    "many theoretical works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that the majority of the icl formed at @xmath8 . according to @xcite ,",
    "it is only since @xmath118 that @xmath119 of the icl of present - day clusters is in place .",
    "we find that the icl age of abell 2744 is younger ( @xmath6 gyr ) than the age of the most massive ( m@xmath120 m@xmath10 ) galaxies of the cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the galaxies that mostly contributed to the icl were producing stars during a larger period of time than the most massive galaxies of the cluster .",
    "this could happen if the satellite galaxies orbiting the cluster were forming stars until their star formation ceased due to ram pressure stripping of their gas content ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "later on , with their star formation stopped , the stellar populations of these satellite galaxies could be stripped from their progenitors and started to contribute to the icl .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to say exactly when the icl in abell 2744 was produced . nonetheless , we can speculate on the basis of the difference between the age of the most massive galaxies and the one derived for the icl .",
    "if we assume that the stellar populations of the most massive galaxies were formed at z@xmath121 ( i.e. @xmath122 gyr ago ) , then the icl of abell 2744 is compatible with being assembled at @xmath8 .",
    "the restframe optical color of the icl of abell 2744 ( @xmath123 ) is consistent with the results of @xcite for the icl of the same cluster ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "we also compare the color of the icl of abell 2744 with the icl colors available for other clusters . as mentioned before , there are few studies regarding the properties of the icl , even colors .",
    "we warn the reader that the clusters studied in the literature have different masses and redshifts making the comparison of such properties not straightforward .",
    "the derived color for the icl of abell 2744 is in agreement with the colors derived for various tidal features in the virgo cluster ( @xmath125 , @xcite ) and the outskirts of m87 ( @xmath126 , @xcite , priv .",
    "@xcite also found blue colors ( @xmath127 ) for two diffuse features in the cluster abell 2667 at @xmath128 compared to the colors of the most massive galaxies ( @xmath129 ) , although there is a hint of a redder @xmath130 color for the icl ( @xmath131 for the icl , @xmath132 for the galaxies ) .    finally , another aspect of the icl that can be directly compared with the theoretical predictions is the fraction of stellar mass of the galaxy cluster that is contained within this component . as we mentioned earlier , the precise definition of what is exactly icl is observationally ill - defined .",
    "here we have used up to three independent parameters to quantify the spatial region corresponding to the icl : @xmath133 mag / arcsec@xmath14 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 kpc .",
    "the amount of stellar mass in the spatial regions defined by those constraints were derived as follows . for @xmath76 the derivation of the mass was straightforward , while for @xmath75 and the radial distance we used equation 1 and the corresponding mass to light ratio in the @xmath71-band for the age and metallicity of the icl region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the total mass of the cluster , including the icl region , was obtained similarly but using all the spatial region covered by the light of the cluster explored in this work ( i.e. @xmath136 kpc around its core ) .",
    "the amount of total stellar mass in this region of the cluster is : @xmath137 m@xmath138 ( @xmath139 mag / arcsec@xmath14 ) , @xmath14010@xmath141 m@xmath138 ( @xmath142 ) and @xmath143 m@xmath138 ( @xmath144 kpc , using our definition of radial distance to the centers of the most massive galaxies of the cluster ) .",
    "the icl mass fractions we got are : @xmath145 for @xmath75 , @xmath146 for @xmath76 and @xmath147 for the radial distance .",
    "these icl mass fractions correspond to the mass contained in @xmath12 milky way - type galaxies .",
    "note , however , that these fractions are lower limits to the global contribution of the icl to the total stellar mass of the cluster .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are not considering the whole cluster ( but only @xmath136 kpc around its core ) and we are also limited by the depth of the optical bands ( particularly for estimating @xmath76 based on the @xmath73 color ) .",
    "how our numbers compare with the theoretical expectations ?",

    "the fraction of stellar mass in the icl is expected to be around @xmath151 of today s value .",
    "consequently , we assume that the fraction of mass in a cluster as abell 2744 should be between @xmath7-@xmath152 .",
    "taking into account that our stellar mass estimates are lower limits , our numbers are in good agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "the simulations are also in nice agreement with other stellar mass fractions measured in other clusters ( @xmath148-@xmath153 ; @xcite ) . over and over",

    "we think this is an indication that we are starting to understand the general picture of how the icl of the galaxy clusters form .",
    "the results presented in this work show the extraordinary power of the frontier fields survey to address the origin and evolution of the icl .",
