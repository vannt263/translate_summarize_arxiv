    "low - energy phenomena related to strong interaction are ultimately traceable directly from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of strong interactions .",
    "it is often difficult to do this since the theory is strongly coupled and the conventional perturbative expansion in powers of a coupling constant , i.e. , around a non - interacting theory , is not applicable . in order to gain insight into the phenomena it is often useful to use alternative expansion schemes such as the chiral expansion about the massless quark limit , and the @xmath1 expansion about the the large @xmath0 limit .    the number of colors @xmath0 is a hidden parameter of qcd , which is built upon the gauge @xmath2 symmetry with @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that many aspects of qcd simplify substantially in the limiting case of infinite number of colors @xmath4 .",
    "thus it makes sense to study the theory in this limit and to establish an expansion in the powers of @xmath1 around this simpler theory .",
    "the chiral expansion is based on the fact that the mass of the pion is much lower than all other scales @xcite . moreover , in the chiral limit , @xmath5 , qcd possesses a new symmetry , the chiral symmetry , which , again , simplifies the problem substantially .",
    "consequently , it is a promising approach to develop models of qcd in these two limits .",
    "even though these limits do not completely describe the real world , they are believed to capture many of its main ( at least qualitative ) features .",
    "moreover , one can develop a systematic procedure how to include the corrections in the powers of either @xmath1 or @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that the double limit is not uniform for certain observables and that the leading behavior may depend on the ordering of the two limits @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out by witten @xcite that in the large @xmath0 limit , qcd becomes a weakly interacting theory of mesons with baryons emerging as soliton - like configurations of meson fields . a class of baryon models based on this observation plus approximate chiral symmetry has been developed , namely chiral soliton models treated semi - classically .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit of qcd is encoded in the very core of these models and its semiclassical treatment ; their degrees of freedom are weakly interacting mesons forming soliton - like solutions identified with baryons .",
    "the issue of chiral limit , and following chiral symmetry , is somewhat more subtle ; it is imposed at a later stage as a constraint on the dynamics of meson fields .",
    "such observations can be formulated more rigorously : chiral soliton models when treated semiclassically are models based on large @xmath0 and chiral limits of qcd with @xmath4 taken first .",
    "an example of such a model is the famous skyrme model @xcite .",
    "here , baryons are identified with the quantum states of collective motions of skyrmions , the hedgehog configurations of meson fields .    in principle",
    ", one could develop an infinite number of models based on large @xmath0 and chiral limits of qcd .",
    "of course , there is more to modeling qcd than simply getting the large @xmath0 and chiral behavior correct and thus the class of models can differ substantially in dynamical detail . still , it is important to develop a method how to check whether the large @xmath0 and chiral physics are encoded correctly in these models .",
    "the obvious tools are various model - independent relations .",
    "there is a large class of model - independent constraints based on consistency relations for large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "such consistency relations can greatly constrain the chiral behavior associated with the longest distance behavior of the system @xcite provided that it is understood that these relations hold when the large @xmath0 limit is taken prior to the chiral limit . any viable model based on the large @xmath0 and chiral limits",
    "needs to reproduce these relations .",
    "it is worth noting that semiclassical chiral soliton models reproduce all known model - independent relations of this type , independently of all the detailed dynamics of the model . indeed",
    ", many of these relations were first discovered in the context of the skyrme model when it was noted by adkins and nappi @xcite that certain relations held regardless of the parameters of the model .",
    "recently , there has been a wide interest in using gauge / gravity duality in the construction of holographic baryon models @xcite .",
    "these models also implicitly contain large @xmath0 limit in the very core of their construction .",
    "the details of these models look quite different from the traditional 4d soliton - based models ",
    "if for no other reason the models are in five dimensions .",
    "the boundary values of some of the bulk fields act as sources for operators with meson quantum numbers in the field theory , and baryons are modeled as quantum states of topologically nontrivial configurations of these bulk fields .",
    "because these models are so different from conventional soliton models and are rather nontrivial to implement , it is particularly important to test whether they have , in fact , correctly encoded the chiral and large @xmath0 scaling behavior . to do this",
    "a new class of model - independent relation needs to be formulated .",
    "the reason for this is that the chiral behavior associated with long distance behavior in the typical model - independent relation simply fixed the coefficient of how certain quantities such as charge radii diverge as @xmath7 .",
    "however , to date many of the treatments of these models have only been done for @xmath8 and hence one can not use the behavior of how these quantities diverge with @xmath9 . instead of using the @xmath9 dependence to probe the long distance behavior , one can use the long distance behavior of the fourier transform of the electromagnetic form factors as a model - independent probe @xcite .",
    "this new type of model - independent relation has already proven to be of great value in studying holographic soliton models . while a `` bottom up '' phenomenological model @xcite",
    "could be shown to satisfy the new model - independent relation , indicating that it had correctly captured the large @xmath0 and chiral behavior , the treatment of solitons as instantons @xcite in the `` top down '' model of sakai and sugimoto @xcite failed to satisfy the relation indicating that something was seriously wrong with the approach despite the claimed phenomenological successes of the approach .",
    "it was recently shown by cherman and ishii @xcite that the underlying reason for this appears to be due to a failure of the flat - space instanton approximation .",
    "this may have important phenomenological consequences since it was this approximation which led to a vector - meson dominance picture @xcite and the one - meson exchange picture on nucleon - nucleon forces @xcite .",
    "a particularly useful relation of this type is for a ratio of the product of the isovector and isoscalar position - space electric form factors to the product of the magnetic nucleon form factors in the long distance limit : @xmath10 where the position - space isoscalar and isovector electric and magnetic form factors @xmath11 are fourier transformed momentum - space electric and magnetic form factors @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the remarkable thing about this particular ratio ( [ magicalratio ] ) is that _ all _ low - energy constants , normalization of currents , and various sign or fourier transform conventions cancel . thus , the final result depends only on a given power of radius @xmath13 ( easily deduced from dimensional analysis ) multiplied by a constant .",
    "this constant , 18 , is a universal model - independent quantity that must be satisfied in all large @xmath0 chiral models .",
    "we note in passing that the number 18 is particularly significant .",
    "the hebrew characters for 18 corresponding to the word `` chai '' which means life and thus 18 is considered to be a lucky number in the jewish tradition .",
    "moreover there are 18 chapters in the bhagavad gita .",
    "finally we note that 18 is the drinking age in most civilized countries including the czech republic .    the relation in eq .",
    "( [ magicalratio ] ) _ does _ depend on the order of limits and is valid if the large @xmath0 limit is taken prior to the chiral and large @xmath13 limits .",
    "equation ( [ magicalratio ] ) was originally @xcite derived in a similar spirit to adkins and nappi @xcite , namely using the skyrme model to find a truly model - independent relation .",
    "it turns out that eq .",
    "( [ magicalratio ] ) is true in _ any _ skyrme model , independent of the details of the lagrangian or the number of degrees of freedom in the problem provided that the model has a well - defined chiral limit in which the pions emerge as goldstone bosons and provided that the model is treated semi - classically .",
    "this seems to be compelling evidence that the result is truly model independent since in all known cases where a chiral result is derived from the skyrme model , and turns out to be completely independent of model details , have also turned out to be the result of large @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory which is known to correctly describe the longest distance quantities in qcd .",
    "however , it is important to verify eq .",
    "( [ magicalratio ] ) in a truly model - independent way directly from large @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory .",
    "doing so is the principal purpose of this paper",
    ". we will also explore what happens to the longest distance behavior of the form factors when the ordering of limits is changed so that the chiral limit is taken prior to the large @xmath0    the long distance hadronic physics in qcd is dominated by the pion cloud , since a pion is the lightest particle available .",
    "moreover , in the baryon sector , unlike in the meson one , the pion loops contribute at leading order in @xmath1 expansion @xcite , so the dominant diagrams to consider to describe the longest distance behavior will consist of currents connected to the pion in loops containing the fewest possible number of pions .",
    "additional simplification comes from the fact that baryon mass is of order @xmath0 and thus parametrically large compared to the pion mass .",
    "it allows us to neglect the recoil of the baryons and treat them non - relativistically . in other words , we will work in the heavy baryon @xmath14 .",
    "note that we work in the combined large @xmath0 and chiral limit . in this case , a subtlety arises for observables sensitive to the dynamics of the pion .",
    "these two limits generally do not commute and therefore the ordering of limits matter @xcite . in our paper",
    "we start by considering the following ordering : @xmath15 limit first , @xmath5 limit second .",
    "it is exactly the ordering that both soliton models of baryons ( both four dimensional and holographic models ) use implicitly .",
    "the role of the large @xmath0 limit in @xmath14 is two - fold .",
    "first , it eliminates diagrams that are suppressed by factors @xmath1 .",
    "second , it forces one to include @xmath16-isobar in the calculation .",
    "the large @xmath0 consistency relations require nucleon and @xmath16 to be degenerate ( in general the whole tower of @xmath17 isobars ) at large @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , the mass difference @xmath18 is of order @xmath1 and serves as a new low - energy constant .",
    "thus , at lowest order in large @xmath0 , @xmath19pt depends on the constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "the need to include the @xmath16 increases the number of feynman diagrams contributing and has far - reaching consequences .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for isoscalar - scalar ( @xmath22 ) and isovector - vector ( @xmath23 ) channels , @xmath16 in the intermediate state only leads to a multiplicative factor .",
    "however , in the isoscalar - vector ( @xmath24 ) and isovector - scalar ( @xmath25 ) channels , the amplitudes corresponding to individual diagrams subtract exactly in the leading order in @xmath1 ( where @xmath26 ) , and one must take into account the @xmath27-@xmath16 mass splitting .",
    "consequently @xmath24 and @xmath25 are proportional to @xmath16 ( and are of order @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that in the relation ( [ magicalratio ] ) one of these quantities is in the numerator and one of them in the denominator , so that the dependence on @xmath16 cancels .",
    "the calculation of form factors is performed in the language of quantum field theory .",
    "thus , we need the feynman rules for the following vertices : photon and two pions , photon and three pions , pion with baryons in all four possible combinations of incoming and outgoing nucleon and @xmath16 , as well as propagators of intermediate pions , nucleons , and @xmath16s . details of the calculation are in the appendix , so only basic assumptions , building blocks and results are presented here .    the feynman rules can be obtained from the standard @xmath19pt lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the interaction of photon with two pions is crucial for the isovector coupling of photon to nucleon ( see the @xmath28 ) .",
    "the feynman rule for the vertex reads : @xmath29    the coupling of photon with three pions relates to qcd anomaly @xcite .",
    "it is crucial for the isoscalar piece of the baryon current ( see the @xmath30 ) .",
    "the feynman rule for the corresponding vertex is : @xmath31    the interaction of a pion with a baryon is of the vector - isovector form and is derivatively coupled .",
    "the feynman rule for incoming baryon @xmath32 and outgoing baryon @xmath33 reads : @xmath34 in ( [ vertexpbbtext ] ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are operators acting in the isospin and in the spin space , respectively .",
    "they are a generalization of pauli matrices , which appear in the pion - nucleon - nucleon vertex in standard @xmath19pt @xcite .",
    "the form of the couplings is determined by the consistency relations of large @xmath0 qcd @xcite .",
    "simply , the interaction is of the same form as standard pion - nucleon - nucleon ( vector - isovector ) where ordinary @xmath37 pauli matrices ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are replaced by the properly normalized @xmath40 matrices ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) whose elements are given by the clebsch - gordan coefficients ( see appendix for more details ) .    the other two low - energy constants ( @xmath6 and @xmath16 ) enter the calculation in propagators of intermediate state particles . since we intend to set @xmath41 in the end ( chiral limit ) we must use the full relativistic pion propagator ( @xmath42 being propagating 4-momentum ) : @xmath43 the heavy baryon approximation , which is justified by the fact that we work in the large @xmath0 limit , allows us to treat baryons non - relativistically : @xmath44 we see that the difference between nucleon and @xmath16 propagators lies in the factor @xmath16 ( of order @xmath1 ) in the denominator .",
    "it is exactly the difference that makes @xmath24 and @xmath25 nonzero and of order @xmath1 .    having all necessary ingredients ( [ vertexfpptext])-([propndtext ] ) one can proceed to the calculation of photon - nucleon interaction amplitudes @xmath45 , and , from here , extract the appropriate form factors .",
    "note that the fourier transformed ( i.e. position - space ) form factors are finite even in the chiral limit @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , sending @xmath5 allows us to perform both the loop momentum integration and the fourier transform analytically and thus obtain the form factors in a closed form .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to the isoscalar current are summarized in fig.[isoscadiagrams ] and described in the appendix . evaluating these diagrams , fourier transforming , setting the pion mass to zeros and then extracting the longest distance part of isoscalar electric and magnetic form factors yields : @xmath46    -isobar).,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] 0.1 in -isobar).,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] 0.1 in -isobar).,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] 0.1 in -isobar).,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]",

    "( [ resultise])-([resultivm ] ) are identical to those from the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "we have shown , however , that these are truly model - independent relations and so do not depend in any way on the skyrme model .",
    "of course , in verifying these results for a given model , one must use the values of @xmath20 , @xmath48 , and @xmath16 from the same model .",
    "we note again that in deriving these relations we explicitly took the large @xmath0 limit prior to any others .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite one can trivially use the results of ( [ resultise])-([resultivm ] ) to show that the relation ( [ magicalratio ] ) is satisfied in the large @xmath0 @xmath19pt .",
    "@xmath49    as advertised , all low energy constants canceled in the ratio of form factors and only universal number 18 remains .",
    "the cancellation of @xmath16 was pointed out earlier in this letter .",
    "however , it is trivial to see that @xmath20 and @xmath48 also cancel . this a particularly useful model - independent result .",
    "the calculation reported above was done by taking the chiral limit  albeit after the large @xmath0 limit is taken .",
    "it is useful to consider what happens when @xmath9 remains finite .",
    "note that the amplitude for finding a pion far away from the baryon is yuakawa - like and modifies the simple power law behavior by @xmath50 .",
    "since the longest - range isovector part of the electromagnetic current is dominated by the two - pion contribution , one expects the longest range part of both the electric and magnetic isovector form factors to be proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , both the electric and magnetic isoscalar form factors are expected to be proportional to @xmath52 , since the isoscalar physics is dominated by the three - pion contribution .",
    "thus , it appears that all terms proportional to exponentials cancel in the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ magicalratio ] ) and its value remains @xmath53 even away from the chiral limit .    the ratio computed in eq .",
    "( [ magicalratioresult ] ) in previous paragraphs was calculated by taking @xmath4 limit at the outset .",
    "note that the problem has three control parameters@xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath13 which is used to select out the the long distance limit @xmath54 ( which is essential in our study of the ratio of form factors ) .",
    "as stressed earlier , the limits considered in our paper do not commute in general and therefore the ordering of limits must be specified .",
    "the issue we wish to discuss here is what happens if one takes the large @xmath0 limit at the end of the problem rather than at the outset .",
    "the key issue to address is the presence of @xmath16-isobar in the intermediate state since this is the origin of the difference .",
    "the key point is that if the large @xmath0 limit is taken at the outset , the @xmath16 is degenerate with the nucleon , and intermediate states containing @xmath16s contribute to the longest distance parts of the form factors . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is finite then the @xmath16 is not degenerate with the nucleon and this energy difference means that diagrams with intermediate @xmath16s contribute a shorter range than analogous diagrams with nucleons .",
    "consider , for concreteness , the isovector diagrams in fig.[isovecdiagrams ] .",
    "the presence of the @xmath16 in the second diagram leads to a suppression factor of the form @xmath55 in the amplitude coming from the @xmath16 propagator .",
    "moreover , both amplitudes contain a factor of the form @xmath56 coming from pion propagators .",
    "we see that taking @xmath57 first eliminates the difference between two amplitudes .",
    "this observation lies in the core of the argument , why both diagrams must be included if @xmath4 is taken first . on the other hand , in the reversed order of limits ( @xmath5 first , @xmath54 , @xmath4 last ) , the contribution of the diagram with @xmath16 remains suppressed",
    "thus , only the diagram with the intermediate nucleon contributes .    for isoscalar electric and isovector magnetic form factors , diagrams",
    "add up in the leading order , thus the difference is only in the multiplicative factor : @xmath58 for isoscalar magnetic and isovector electric form factors , the diagrams originally subtracted in the leading order , and form factors were proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the form factors in reverse ordering of limits differ not only by a multiplicative factor but also by a dimensionless quantity @xmath59 . @xmath60 combining the results of eqs .",
    "( [ resultise_ro])-([resultive_ro ] ) we see that the ratio ( [ magicalratio ] ) differs by half if the order of large @xmath0 and chiral limits is reversed : @xmath61",
    "we proved that the relation ( [ magicalratio ] ) holds in the large @xmath0 @xmath19pt , provided that the @xmath4 limit is taken at the outset of the problem .",

    "@xcite was adopted : @xmath77 the expansion of current matrix elements ( [ currentsnonrel ] ) allows us to distinguish and define the isoscalar and the isovector current .",

    "<S> in this paper a model - independent relation which holds for the long distance part of the fourier transform of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon in the large @xmath0 and chiral limits is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> this relation was previously conjectured based on the fact that it emerged in _ all _ semiclassical chiral models independent of the details of the model . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the result is , in fact , model independent by deriving it directly in large @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory which is known to capture the long distance behavior of the form factors . </S>",
    "<S> the relation is valid when the large @xmath0 limit is formally taken before the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> a new relation is derived for the case where the chiral limit is taken prior to the large @xmath0 limit .    </S>",
