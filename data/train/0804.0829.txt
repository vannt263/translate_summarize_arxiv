    "mixed - mode oscillations ( mmos ) refer to oscillatory behavior in which a number ( l ) of large amplitude oscillations is followed by a number ( s ) of small amplitude oscillations , differing in an order of magnitude , to form a complex pattern ( @xmath0 ) of oscillations of varying amplitudes .",
    "mmos were first noticed in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite , and have been subsequently witnessed in experiments and models of numerous chemical @xcite and biological @xcite systems .",
    "recently there has been work on mmos in models of neurons @xcite . in the context of neural dynamics ,",
    "large oscillations correspond to firing of action potentials while small oscillations correspond to subthreshold oscillations ( sto ) .",
    "we have discovered mmos in a biophysical model of a neuron in the entorhinal cortex ( ec ) introduced by acker et al.@xcite .",
    "the ec is thought to play a prominent role in memory formation through its reciprocal interactions with the hippocampus and participation in the generation of the theta rhythm ( 4 - 12 hz ) @xcite .",
    "pyramidal neurons in layer v of the entorhinal cortex have been found to possess electrophysiological characteristics very similar to those seen in layer ii stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex @xcite , including their propensity to produce intrinsic subthreshold oscillations at theta frequencies . in layer v pyramidal cells these subthreshold oscillations are thought to arise from an interplay between a persistent sodium current and a slow potassium current @xcite , while in layer ii stellate cells , they are thought to arise from an interplay between a persistent sodium current and a hyperpolarization activated inward current ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .    the model from acker et al.@xcite that we employ includes these currents and captures some dynamical aspects of the generation of stos in layer v pyramidal cells .",
    "after a numerical investigation of the dynamics of the full model that displays the interaction of the persistent sodium and slow potassium currents to form stos , we modify it by replacing the persistent sodium current by a tonic applied current .",
    "this can be interpreted as the modeling of an electrophysiological experiment designed to investigate the effects of blocking the persistent sodium current .",
    "the modified model displays mmos , and the main focus of this work is to understand their nature . in order to simplify the analysis of the model",
    ", we perform a reduction of dimensions analysis @xcite to reduce the 6-d system into a 3-d system .    among the proposed mechanisms for mmos",
    "are break - up of an invariant torus @xcite , break up / loss of stability of a shilnikov homoclinic orbit @xcite and subcritical hopf bifurcation combined with a suitable return mechanism @xcite .",
    "well known in the context systems with multiple time scales is the _ canard mechanism _ , introduced ( to the best of our knowledge ) by milik and szmolyan @xcite .",
    "it is based on the presence of _ canards _ , which are defined as solutions that originate in a stable slow manifold and continue to an unstable slow manifold while passing through a thin region of non - hyperbolic behavior , which we refer to as the _ fold region_. primary canard solutions , that neither perform small amplitude oscillations nor spike , can act as dynamic boundaries between regions of small oscillations and spiking .",
    "canard solutions have been analyzed in three dimensions using non - standard analysis by benoit @xcite and using techniques of geometric singular perturbation theory in combination with blow - up techniques by szmolyan and wechselberger @xcite .",
    "a general mechanism of mmos based on the existence of canards has been postulated in @xcite .",
    "there is a variety of different examples which , with some modifications , fit into the context of this general mechanism @xcite .",
    "our model fits into the context of a system with multiple timescales ; we will show that the occurrence of mmos in our model is related to the presence of canards .",
    "however , while in most of the other examples of canard mechanism small oscillations are due to rotations about a canard solution called the weak canard @xcite , in our case , during the stage of small oscillations , some of the trajectories follow closely the unstable manifold of an equilibrium of oscillatory type , very close to a hopf bifurcation . in this aspect",
    "our system is similar to the systems studied in @xcite .",
    "consequently our model provides a novel mechanism for mmos , one in which both canards and dynamics near a saddle - focus equilibrium play an important role .",
    "we designed a three time scale model system that accurately reproduces most of the features of the neuronal model , and a significant part of this work is devoted to the analysis of the three time scale model equation .",
    "most of the work , at least to some degree , relies on numerics .",
    "we show that canards can exist , but we conjecture they occur on parameter intervals of exponentially small width ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ratio of the two slowest timescales ) .",
    "this is similar to the case of two dimensional canard explosion ( known also as the canard phenomenon ) , where a small oscillation grows through a sequence of canard cycles to a relaxation oscillation as the control parameter moves through an interval of exponentially small width @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the two slow / one fast variable systems studied by szmolyan , wechselberger and others , canards occur in a robust manner , i.e. , on open parameter intervals of size independent of the singular parameter .",
    "we also discover the role of canards in our system : we show ( relying to some degree on numerics ) that the transition from mmos to pure spiking must correspond to a canard solution .",
    "we compute a canard numerically and compare the relevant parameter value to the parameter value of the transition from mmos to spiking , finding that the two values are almost equal .",
    "we also calculate analytically the @xmath4 approximation of the numerically computed canard .",
    "an outline of the paper is the following . in section [ sec - model",
    "] , we introduce the model and display the dynamical properties and bifurcation structure of the original acker et al .",
    "model through simulations of the full system .",
    "we also perform a reduction of dimensions analysis to reduce the 6-d system to a 3-d system with three time scales in the subthreshold regime . in section [ mmosection ]",
    ", we introduce the modification of replacing the persistent sodium current with a tonic applied current , and we analyze the mechanism for the mmos observed in the modified model .",
    "we begin with a phase space description of the mmo activity through simulations .",
    "next we propose a three time scale model problem , by adding an additional slower time scale to the model of szmolyan and wechselberger @xcite , and transform our system into this form .",
    "the three time scale model has a hopf bifurcation and some of the dynamics in mmo sequences follows closely the unstable manifold of the unstable equilibrium , which reproduces well the behavior of the neuronal model . in our analysis of the mmos in the three time scale model , a fundamental observation is that during the approach to the fold region the trajectories are attracted to a single trajectory , a 1-d ( super ) slow manifold contained in the attracting branch of a folded 2-d slow manifold . to investigate the flow near the fold curve , we perform an @xmath3 ( singular perturbation parameter ) dependent rescaling which blows up the flow near the fold curve .",
    "we define _ singular canards _ as solutions of this system satisfying certain asymptotic properties and find explicitly a singular canard that is a polynomial vector function of the independent variable . by employing appropriate rescalings , center manifold reductions , and energy arguments",
    ", we prove that a continuous family of canard solutions must converge , as @xmath5 , to a singular canard .",
    "consequently , we prove that if a transition from mmo to spiking occurs along a continuous curve @xmath6 then @xmath7 must be a value for which a singular canard exists .",
    "we conjecture that the mentioned polynomial solution is the only existing singular canard and provide numerical evidence for this conjecture .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of related and future work in section [ sec - discussion ] .",
    "to investigate stos and mmos in ec layer v pyramidal cells , we consider a biophysical model introduced by acker et al .",
    "@xcite that includes two currents ( persistent sodium ( @xmath8 ) and slow , non - inactivating potassium ( @xmath9 ) ) whose interaction is known to be responsible for the generation of stos in these cells @xcite .",
    "in addition , the model contains the standard hodgkin - huxley currents @xcite : transient sodium ( @xmath10 ) , delayed rectifier potassium ( @xmath11 ) , and leak ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the current balance equation for the model is given by    @xmath13    where c is the membrane capacitance ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the membrane potential ( mv ) , @xmath16 is the applied bias current ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is conductance ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the reversal potential ( mv ) , and the time @xmath21 is in @xmath22 . also , we define @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . the values of the parameters can be found in the appendix .",
    "the dynamics of each of the gating variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 is described by a first order equation of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the gating variable , @xmath32 represents the voltage - dependent time constant , and @xmath33 represents the voltage dependent steady state values of the gating variable .",
    "we will see that the @xmath8 and @xmath9 play an important role in the generation of subthreshold oscillations .",
    "the activation and inactivation curves @xmath33 for the gating variables are shown in figure [ figactivcurves ] while the voltage dependent timescales @xmath32 are shown in figure [ figratecurves ] .",
    "simulations of the full system - show that the model fits into the category of class 2 neural excitability @xcite . using the applied current as a bifurcation parameter",
    ", the system undergoes a subcritical hopf bifurcation as @xmath16 is increased as seen by figure [ figfullsysdefaultbif ] .",
    "thus , as @xmath16 is increased , the cell switches between three different regimes . in the first regime ( @xmath34 )",
    ", there is a single stable rest state which is converged to through damped subthreshold oscillations . in the second regime ( @xmath35 ) , there is bi - stability of the rest state and periodically spiking solutions , which are separated by unstable , small amplitude oscillations generated through a subcritical hopf bifurcation ( see figure [ fullbistab ] ) .",
    "the spiking solutions start with a minimal frequency of about 5hz while the damped subthreshold oscillations have a frequency of about 10hz . also , the replacement of the slow potassium current with a tonic drive results in the absence of subthreshold oscillations ( as in @xcite ) while the replacement of the persistent sodium current with a tonic drive will be discussed in section [ mmosection ] .",
    "we note that the damped subthreshold oscillations involve the interplay of the slow potassium current and the persistent sodium current as seen in figure [ stofull ] . at the transition between the first and second regimes ,",
    "we observe dynamics reminiscent of a 2-d canard phenomenon in which the trajectory shown follows a repelling unstable manifold . the third regime ( @xmath36 )",
    "consists of stable , periodic firing .",
    "we show that during the interspike interval , which corresponds to the subthreshold voltage regime , we can reduce the system to a 3-dimensional system ( [ reduced3dsys ] ) . by analyzing the voltage dependent timescales @xmath32 seen in figure [ figratecurves ]",
    ", we see that @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we seem to have three timescales with @xmath38 and @xmath39 evolving very quickly and @xmath29 evolving very slowly .",
    "thus , letting @xmath40 and @xmath41 yields a reasonable approximation . by considering figure",
    "[ figactivcurves ] and [ figratecurves ] , we see that when @xmath15 is hyperpolarized , @xmath42 evolves much faster to its steady state value ( its time scale is  4 times smaller ) than @xmath43 . also , we note that @xmath44 . thus",
    ", @xmath42 quickly approaches its steady state value @xmath45 , and then it can track it closely since @xmath45 changes very slowly during the interspike interval .",
    "thus , we replace @xmath42 with @xmath45 and retain @xmath43 .",
    "hence , we can reduce the system to one for which only @xmath46 and @xmath43 are dynamic variables .    to investigate the importance of the spiking currents ( sodium and potassium )",
    ", we also perform a bifurcation analysis .",
    "when @xmath10 is removed , the system exhibits a supercritical hopf bifurcation in which sustained , stable subthreshold oscillations appear .",
    "( see figure [ figfullsysdefaultgna0bif ] . )",
    "this change in the bifurcation criticality due to @xmath10 removal shows that the transient sodium current plays an important role in the interspike interval . with",
    "@xmath47 removed , the bifurcation structure is retained , but there is a significant shift in the hopf bifurcation point ( from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ) . by retaining the @xmath43 equation , and replacing @xmath50 and @xmath38 with their steady state activation and inactivation functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , we obtain the reduced 3d system    @xmath53    where @xmath54 has been replaced by its constant value , @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the bifurcation diagram for this system ( see figure [ 3dnbif ] ) is very similar to that of the full system .    typically , the spiking currents are not included in the biophysical description of the subthreshold regime as in generalized integrate - and - fire models , which are constructed by biophysically describing the subthreshold regime using non - spiking currents and adding artificial spikes @xcite .",
    "this system provides an example where neglecting the spiking currents in the biophysical description of the subthreshold regime leads to a qualitative change in the cell s dynamics , i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath10 must be included in this reduced system since our model is sensitive to small changes in the sodium and potassium currents during the latter part of the interspike interval before the spike . in some cases",
    "it has been shown that these currents play no critical role in the subthreshold regime @xcite .",
    "we have discovered that in the full system ( [ fullsystemv]-[fullsystemgates ] ) and in the reduced system ( [ reduced3dsys ] ) the replacement of the persistent sodium current with a tonic excitatory drive leads to mixed - mode oscillations in which a large amplitude spike is followed by a number of small amplitude subthreshold oscillations ( see figure [ deepeks3dmmoiapp17_1.ode ] ) .",
    "we note that this modified version of , with the persistent sodium current removed , exhibits a more complex bifurcation structure than itself as seen in figure [ 3dbif ] .",
    "the system exhibits a single equilibrium which loses stability through a subcritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath56 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the system exhibits continuous spiking . for @xmath16 between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the system displays mmos of type @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath16 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the system displays mmos with multiple stos per spike , and the number of stos per spike is a decreasing function of @xmath16 .",
    "finally , for @xmath16 between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the system exhibits sustained subthreshold oscillations .",
    "our goal is to analyze the mechanisms for this behavior in with @xmath65 .",
    "we begin with a geometric interpretation of the mmos using simulations of .",
    "we note that the v - nullsurface is a 2-d surface @xmath66 , and for fixed n , @xmath66 is a cubic shaped curve .",
    "also , we note that possesses a single fixed point , denoted by @xmath67 , which is near the fold curve of the v - nullsurface .",
    "the linearization about @xmath68 yields a large negative eigenvalue and a pair of complex eigenvalues with positive real part , and the ratio of the real eigenvalue to the real part of the complex eigenvalue is about -30 .",
    "thus , @xmath68 possesses a 1-d stable manifold and a 2-d unstable manifold .",
    "numerical simulations show that a mmo trajectory travels down near the left sheet of the v - nullsurface ( slow manifold ) and subsequently passes near the fold , where it gets attracted to the 2-d unstable manifold of the fixed point @xmath68",
    ". see figure [ figorig4 ] .",
    "the 1-d stable eigenspace of @xmath68 is plotted in red in the figures , and the plane displayed in the figures is the unstable eigenspace of @xmath68 .",
    "the trajectory approaches the unstable manifold of @xmath68 , which we denote by @xmath69 , along the stable manifold of @xmath68 .",
    "then the trajectory spirals out from near @xmath68 along @xmath69 and continues to transversally pierce the v - nullsurface ( the loss of alignment with the fast nullsurface during the passage through the fold region is typical for folded node or folded saddle node type dynamics ) , until it becomes tangent to the v - nullsurface . at this point ,",
    "the trajectory leaves @xmath69 and gets attracted to the right sheet of the v - nullsurface since it enters a region in which @xmath15 is strongly repelling from the left sheet .",
    "then , there is a return mechanism ( spiking regime ) that brings the trajectories back to the left sheet of the v - nullsurface .",
    "we note that the feature of a passage near the unstable manifold of a saddle focus equilibrium followed by a reinjection mechanism is reminiscent of shilnikov s example @xcite as well as of the examples where mmos occur through a subcritical hopf bifurcation @xcite ( see section [ sec - discussion ] for a detailed discussion ) .    in the remaining part of this work",
    "much of the focus will be on the following model system @xmath70 where @xmath71 is small and @xmath72 is a control parameter .",
    "system shares many of the features of but is a lot simpler .",
    "the initial part of our analysis is to establish two basic geometric features of the flow :    1 .",
    "there exists an equilibrium of oscillatory type , which loses stability through a hopf bifurcation for @xmath72 close to @xmath73 .",
    "2 .   the critical manifold @xmath74 is a surface with two fold lines .",
    "there exists a 2d attracting slow manifold close to one of the sheets of this surface , and within this slow manifold there is a 1d super - slow manifold , approximating the curve @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "we will show that all the mmo trajectories must pass very close to the super - slow manifold .",
    "consequently , the distance between the continuation of the super - slow manifold to the fold region and the stable manifold of the equilibrium is of great importance for the nature of the mmos .",
    "if this distance is small , then the trajectory must follow for a long time the flow along the 2d unstable manifold of the equilibrium , making many rotations about the equilibrium .",
    "as this distance increases , the role of the unstable manifold of the equilibrium diminishes .    in this work",
    "we have focused on the transition from mmos to spiking .",
    "this occurs in the parameter regime where the continuation of the super - slow manifold , and thus the mmo trajectories , are relatively far from the equilibrium .",
    "we have been able to show , with the help of some numerics , that the transition from mmos to spiking occurs through a canard , and that families of canard solutions converge to singular canards , which are special solutions of a suitable limiting system .",
    "we have also found a parameter value for which a special solution exists .",
    "we conjecture , based on numerical evidence , that this parameter value is unique .      in order to investigate mmos in system",
    ", we transform it to a three timescale toy model of the form @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . to this end , we begin by first treating as a slow - fast system with two timescales in order to obtain a folded singularity , which we will use as the origin for our model system in order to study small amplitude oscillations near the fold curve of the 2-d folded v - nullsurface of . for an exposition on folded singularities , see @xcite .",
    "two timescales are uncovered by dividing the @xmath15 equation of ( [ reduced3dsys ] ) by the maximum conductance @xmath79 and setting @xmath80 we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the conductances in the @xmath15 equation are bounded by 1 and the magnitudes of the @xmath29 and @xmath43 equations are bounded by 1 since @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 evolves on a faster time scale then @xmath29 or @xmath43 .",
    "momentarily , we neglect the fact that @xmath29 and @xmath43 vary on different timescales .    by setting @xmath88",
    ", we obtain the reduced system which is a 2-d dynamical system on the critical manifold @xmath89 .",
    "based on the work of @xcite , we wish to show that @xmath90 is a non - degenerate folded surface in the neighborhood of a folded equilibrium point @xmath91 with @xmath92 . in order to compute @xmath91 , we begin by solving @xmath93 for @xmath29 and obtain @xmath94 .",
    "next , we solve @xmath95 for @xmath15 as a function of @xmath43 and find that @xmath15 is a constant , which we denote by @xmath96 , along the fold curve ( since @xmath97 and @xmath98 are linear in @xmath99 and @xmath29 ) . also , we denote @xmath100 by @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the fold curve is parametrized by @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "also , we differentiate @xmath93 with respect to @xmath21 to obtain @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the reduced 2-d system on the critical manifold can be denoted by @xmath105 where @xmath29 is replaced by @xmath106 . through a solution dependent time rescaling",
    "we obtain the desingularized reduced system @xmath107 we numerically solve @xmath108 for @xmath43 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 to obtain @xmath111 . finally , @xmath112 .",
    "we note that @xmath91 is a fixed point of ( [ reduced2dsys ] ) and ( [ reduced2dsys2 ] ) .",
    "we linearize ( [ reduced2dsys2 ] ) about this fixed point and find that in our parameter regime both eigenvalues are _ negative _ , resulting in a folded node equilibrium .",
    "we note that the quotient of these eigenvalues predicts the maximum number of subthreshold oscillations per spike @xcite for @xmath113 sufficiently small .",
    "however , this prediction is incorrect ( underestimate ) for this system since there are three timescales , resulting in a @xmath113 that is not sufficiently small in the two timescale formulation .    we now shift the folded node point to the origin in with the transformation @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 to obtain @xmath117 next , we rectify the fold curve to the @xmath43 axis .",
    "we note that the fold curve is parametrized by @xmath118 . where @xmath119 .",
    "thus , we make the substitution @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 to obtain @xmath123 we note that @xmath124 .",

    "while the existence of @xmath156 and @xmath157 is standard and not surprising , we also argue that there exists a one - dimensional super - slow manifold ( it can be chosen to be contained in @xmath156 ) , denoted by @xmath161 , that attracts all the dynamics on @xmath156 .",

    "it follows that the dominant eigenvalues of @xmath167 are @xmath172 there is also a third eigenvalue , which is @xmath166 , but we are interested only in the two leading ones . by a slight modification of fenichel theory we can prove that has a one dimensional attracting locally invariant manifold , which we denote by @xmath161 . all the trajectories which make a relaxation loop ( spike ) must become exponentially close to it before they enter the fold region .",
    "thus , there is a single trajectory that needs to be tracked through the fold region to determine the existence of mmos / small amplitude dynamics and this trajectory can be arbitrarily chosen as long as its initial condition is not too close to the fold .",
    "we illustrate this scenario in figure [ slowman1d ] in which we display @xmath164 along with a spiking solution for @xmath173 that tracks @xmath164 quite closely as well as a mmo solution for the larger value of @xmath174 .      in order to understand the flow of in the fold region ,",
    "we introduce a rescaling which blows up a rectangle of size @xmath175 to the size of @xmath166 in each of the directions .",
    "this trick has been widely used in the study of canard problems and was given the name microscope by benoit , diener and others who investigated canard explosion and related problems by means of non - standard analysis @xcite .",
    "in the case of ( [ canon3d ] ) , the microscope rescaling is as follows : @xmath176    in proposition [ prop - bound ] we will prove that mmos can not exist if @xmath177 is too large .",
    "this implies that mmos exist for @xmath178 only .",
    "after rescaling the variables we obtain the following system : @xmath179 by setting @xmath180 we obtain : @xmath181    [ rem - fn ] a similar normal form arises in the study of folded node @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we were interested in studying subthreshold oscillations in pyramidal cells of layer v of the ec . since there was no available model of ec layer v pyramidal cells at the time , and since the two cell types exhibited very similar electrophysiological characteristics , including the presence of persistent sodium and slow potassium currents that are thought to underlie the dynamics of stos , we chose to employ the acker model to model stos in layer v pyramids .",
    "we note that layer v pyramidal cells exhibit many other interesting dynamical properties .",
    "they participate in high frequency ( @xmath390 hz ) `` ripple '' activity associated with hippocampal sharp waves @xcite and are a site of initiation and propagation of epileptiform activity@xcite .",
    "also , they exhibit graded persistent activity , which is associated with memory processes , in which neurons respond to consecutive stimuli with graded changes in firing frequency that remain stable after each stimulus @xcite . in 2006 , fransen et al . introduced a quite detailed multi - compartmental model of layer v pyramidal cells that exhibit the graded persistent activity . in future work",
    ", we plan to adapt our analysis of the simpler model considered here to this more realistic model , and analyze the dynamics of the graded persistent activity .",
    "we began our work with a numerical investigation of the dynamical properties and bifurcation structure of the full model and displayed the role of the persistent sodium and slow potassium currents in the generation of subthreshold oscillations . in order to analyze the 6-d system",
    ", we performed a reduction of dimension analysis to reduce the system to a 3-d system .",
    "we note that a more thorough reduction of dimensions analysis of a similar model of a layer ii stellate cells with an h - current and persistent sodium current was performed by rotstein et al .",
    "@xcite , and a computational tool for reducing systems possessing multiple scales has also been developed @xcite .",
    "rotstein et al .",
    "have also analyzed mmos present in that model @xcite .",
    "just as experimental neuroscientists often modulate or block various currents in order to learn about their role by observing the effects of their absence , we investigated the effect of modulating various currents in our model . upon removing or reducing to a very low level the persistent sodium current and replacing it with a tonic excitatory input",
    ", we witnessed very interesting dynamical phenomena including mmos and seemingly chaotic firing patterns .",
    "( future work includes the investigation of whether our analysis and the dynamical mechanism involved carry over to the case where a small persistent sodium current is retained . )",
    "this experiment is unable to be performed presently in the lab since there are no known drugs which are able to selectively block persistent sodium current without blocking the standard sodium current , and we felt it would be interesting to investigate this regime , especially due to the rich dynamical behavior present .",
    "the main focus of this work is to explain the dynamical mechanisms responsible for the mixed - mode oscillations .",
    "we have discovered and analyzed a novel dynamical mechanism for the generation of mmos , involving the canard phenomenon as well as the dynamics near a saddle focus equilibrium , as in the shilnikov scenario @xcite or the subcritical hopf scenario @xcite .",
    "the techniques we employed to analyze the mmos involve standard techniques from dynamical systems theory such as geometric singular perturbation theory @xcite and center manifold theory @xcite . for",
    "a summary of the analysis , see the last paragraph of section [ sec - intro ] .",
    "a main accomplishment of this work is an analytical expression for the parameter at which the transition between mmos and spiking occurs in the singular limit and a characterization of the corresponding singular primary canard solution responsible for the transition .",
    "moreover , we construct a well developed geometric picture of the dynamics for this new canard - based mmo mechanism since we utilize a great deal of the underlying geometric structure available including slow manifolds , canards , and the saddle - focus equilibrium with its weak unstable manifold . in addition",
    ", the use of the folded - node point from the two time scale model to derive our novel three time scale model is new .",
    "also , our analysis , which resulted from the investigation of a neuronal model , is applicable to studying mmos in other systems from various contexts that have the same underlying dynamical structure , i.e. systems that can be transformed into the form of .",
    "prominent among scenarios for mmos not involving canards are the shilnikov scenario @xcite and the subcritical hopf scenario @xcite .",
    "both involve a saddle focus equilibrium with a two dimensional unstable manifold and a return mechanism of soft reinjection , which basically means that the return mechanism is given by a typical orientation preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "our model system has a saddle focus equilibrium with a weak unstable manifold , but in addition it has a multiple time scale structure , folded critical manifolds , and a singularity similar to a folded node .",
    "one of the consequences is that the return mechanism is not soft , but has a definite structure determined by the slow manifolds .",
    "moreover , as we have demonstrated in the paper , the multiple time scale structure influences subthreshold oscillations by means of canard solutions .",
    "it follows from our analysis that all the orbits leaving the vicinity of the saddle focus equilibrium will be attracted to the super - stable slow manifold , which returns to the vicinity of the equilibrium .",
    "thus the system can be viewed as close to a homoclinic bifurcation . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on the aspects of the problem related to the canard mechanism , but we feel that the methods employed to study homoclinic bifurcations , and especially the passage near a saddle point , may be applicable and useful for a more detailed investigation of our problem . we intend to explore the homoclinic - like features of the problem in future work .    in future work , we also intend to analyze the rotational properties of the solutions of .",
    "for a solution originating in @xmath156 or nearby , we define its _ rotation number _ to be the number of small loops it makes while passing through the _ fold region _ , which we define as a sufficiently large ball centered at the origin in the coordinates @xmath204 .",
    "note that due to the strong attraction of @xmath161 , all the solutions entering the fold region will have the same rotation number , unless the system is very close to a canard .",
    "here we mean a primary canard or a secondary canard , as secondary canards correspond to boundary curves , in the @xmath391 parameter space , between parameter regions for which solutions have different rotation numbers .",
    "we conjecture that for a fixed @xmath3 , there is a sequence of @xmath177 values , corresponding to @xmath339 secondary canards with increasing @xmath339 and to transitions corresponding to an increment by @xmath392 in the rotational number , ending with a region corresponding to the maximal number of rotations beyond which only small amplitude dynamics exists .",
    "also , we have not analyzed the transition from small amplitude dynamics to mmos .",
    "we know from simulations that small amplitude chaos is present , and we conjecture that it is related to the loss of normal hyperbolicity of the unstable manifold of the saddle - focus equilibrium , which must occur sufficiently far away from the equilibrium . also , we believe that it is related to the shilnikov scenario involving incomplete homoclinicity .    another interesting question is how to estimate the rotation number for given values of @xmath177 and @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not foresee that an analytic formula can be obtained , in contrast to related cases in which there are two timescales @xcite .",
    "a conjecture very strongly supported by the numerics is that the rotations happen almost exclusively during the slow drift of the solutions along the unstable manifold of of the saddle focus equilibrium .",
    "we also believe that the flow along this unstable manifold is close to its linear approximation .",
    "once the solutions come to a region where @xmath322 and/or @xmath303 are sufficiently large , the unstable manifold loses normal hyperbolicity and the multiple time scale nature of the system takes over , thus ending the rotational phase of the solution .",
    "however , in order to produce an approximate formula for the number of rotations , one would need to know the distance from the continuation of @xmath161 to the stable manifold of the saddle focus equilibrium , measured in a specified section such as the hyperplane @xmath383 , as well as the distance between the equilibrium and the region where normal hyperbolicity is lost .",
    "one would also need the information on the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the saddle focus equilibrium .",
    "no analytic version of the formula can be expected since it seems quite unlikely to obtain an analytic formula for either the continuation of @xmath161 all the way to the section @xmath383 or the stable manifold of the saddle focus equilibrium , but a numerical formula seems achievable .",
    "note that even in the case of @xcite , only a formula asymptotic in @xmath3 is available , and in fact the formula of szmolyan and wechselberger is the @xmath4 approximation . in our case , we can consider an asymptotic formula based on the linear approximation of the flow along the unstable manifold , and in the @xmath4 approximation this would mean that @xmath222 would be used instead of the continuation of @xmath161 .",
    "however , again no analytic formula can be expected as no analytic expression for @xmath222 is available , except for the special case where @xmath233 .",
    "a possibility would be to obtain an asymptotic expression using center manifold theory , along the ideas of section [ sec - spec ] , and we plan to pursue this idea in future work .",
    "the full model for the layer v pyramidal cell is given by @xmath393    the default parameters for the system are : @xmath394 , @xmath395 , @xmath396 , @xmath397 , @xmath398 , @xmath86 , @xmath399 , @xmath400 , and @xmath401 .",
