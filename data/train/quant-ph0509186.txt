    "efficient generation of photon pairs in the 1550-nm fiber - optic communication band would be useful for practical realizations of quantum communication , for example , long - distance fiber - optic quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "photon pairs are usually generated at visible wavelengths using the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in second - order nonlinear bulk crystals @xcite .",
    "recently , however , photon - pair generation in the 1550-nm band has been demonstrated @xcite . in these experiments , large - sized lasers with high power , such as ti : sapphire lasers , were used due to the low conversion efficiency of the photon - pair sources .",
    "however , a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide ( ppln - wg ) has the potential to generate photon pairs much more efficiently than the bulk crystals previously used .",
    "this stems from the fact that the largest nonlinear coefficient @xmath2 can be utilized through quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) , and that the guiding structure permits confinement of the pump beam over the entire interaction length .",
    "therefore , small , handy , and low - cost semiconductor lasers can be used in combination with these nonlinear waveguides @xcite .    in most quantum information applications , the probability for generating simultaneous multiple photon pairs",
    "must be kept low .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate the photon - pair distribution when characterizing a source .",
    "direct measurements of photon - number distributions have recently been demonstrated using a visible - light photon counter @xcite and a superconducting transition - edge sensor @xcite .",
    "however , these measurements were carried out under cryogenic conditions and are too extreme to allow for common use .    in this paper",
    ", we report on efficient generation of photon pairs at 1550  nm using a ppln - wg pumped by a pulsed semiconductor laser . by analyzing the detected single and coincidence counts as functions of the pump power",
    ", we find that our measurements are in agreement with a poissonian photon - pair distribution .",
    "this is also found to be in agreement with a comparison of the coherence times of the pump and photon pairs .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : setup ] , our experimental setup is schematically depicted . a 3  cm long",
    "ppln - wg ( hc photonics ) is pumped by a pulsed semiconductor laser ( pico quant pdl 800 ) .",
    "the laser light has a wavelength of 774  nm and is generated in @xmath340  ps long pulses with a peak power of @xmath3340  mw and a repetition rate of 800  khz .",
    "qpm for degenerate down - conversion at 1548  nm is obtained by heating the waveguide to 70@xmath4c , which also suppresses the photorefractive effect @xcite .",
    "both the signal and idler photon of each photon pair have the same polarization as the pump . in order to measure only the down - converted photons ,",
    "the emerging light from the waveguide goes through an interference filter ( if ) with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 30  nm centered around 1550  nm .",
    "the transmitted down - converted photons are subsequently coupled to a 50/50 single - mode fiber coupler ( 50/50 fc ) before they are detected by two single - photon detectors ( d1 and d2 ) .",
    "the detectors are ingaas / inp avalanche photodiodes ( epitaxx epm239ba ) operated in gated passive quenching mode at -40@xmath4c @xcite . a delay / pulse generator ( stanford research systems dg535 )",
    "is used to gate the detectors .",
    "the gate pulses are @xmath31  ns long and the gating rate is 800  khz , that is , the same as the optical pulse rate .",
    "the output signals from the detectors are finally sent to a coincidence counter ( stanford research systems sr400 ) .",
    "the maximum value of the coincidence counts is obtained by synchronizing the gate pulses with the optical pulses at each detector .",
    "the quantum efficiency of d1 was 25% and its dark - count probability was @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding values for d2 were 10% and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    ": count rate at d1 , @xmath7 : count rate at d2 , @xmath8 : count rate at the coincidence counter .",
    "[ fig : setup],width=340 ]",
    "since our detectors can not distinguish if one or more photons make them click , the single - count rate at detector @xmath9 ( when neglecting dark counts ) can be expressed as @xmath10 , \\label{eq : sk}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the pulse rate , @xmath12 denotes the probability for @xmath13 photon pairs to be generated , @xmath14 is the transmittivity of the optical components , and @xmath15 is the detector efficiency .",
    "similarly , the coincidence - count rate can be written as @xmath16 [ 1 - ( 1 - t \\eta_2)^{2 m - n } ] .",
    "\\label{eq : c}\\ ] ] as we will describe below , the photon - pair distribution @xmath12 resulting from the spdc process depends on the experimental conditions .",
    "it is well known that the degenerate spdc process produces the squeezed vacuum state when no initial photons are present in the down - conversion mode .",
    "the corresponding photon - pair distribution @xcite can be expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average number of photons , and the squeezing parameter @xmath19 is proportional to the electric field of the pump @xcite .",
    "assuming that the pump pulse has the same form for all pump powers , we thus obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant and @xmath22 is the average pump power .",
    "we note that @xmath23 for small squeezing parameters @xmath24 .      with no initial photons in the signal and idler modes ,",
    "the nondegenerate spdc process produces the two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "the photon - pair distribution is then thermal @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath0 denotes the average number of photon pairs .",
    "analogous to the degenerate case , we obtain relation ( [ eq : musqvac ] ) .",
    "if we instead assume that the detected photons originate from many distinguishable down - conversion processes , the photon - pair distribution can be approximated by the poissonian distribution @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average value of the total number of photon pairs generated by a single pump pulse @xcite .",
    "as there are many distinguishable processes , the average photon - pair number in each of them is usually small ( @xmath28 ) , and therefore proportional to average pump power . for both degenerate and nondegenerate spdc ,",
    "we then get @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "the effects of losses are slightly involved due to the fact that photon pairs are generated throughout the waveguide .",
    "the optical pump power in the waveguide should be well described by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the optical power coupled into the guided mode , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the loss and propagation distance in the waveguide , respectively .",
    "as discussed above , the average number of generated photon pairs is proportional to the pump power when @xmath28 . denoting the corresponding constant as @xmath35 and the length of the waveguide as @xmath36 , these assumptions give us the following expression for the average number of photons generated by a single pump pulse @xmath37 losses for the down - converted light will split photon pairs and make the photon distribution consist of both even and odd numbers of photons . using the notation @xmath38 for this loss in the waveguide",
    ", the average number of photons reaching the back facet at @xmath39 is found to be @xmath40 where we have assumed @xmath41 .",
    "the length of our waveguide is @xmath42  cm and its losses are approximately @xmath43  db / cm and @xmath44  db / cm , according to the manufacturer . since the losses expressed in decibel are related to the losses in the equations above according to @xmath45 , we find the effective internal transmittivity to be @xmath46 .",
    "the facet is antireflection coated for 1550  nm , and the corresponding waveguide - air transmittivity is @xmath47 .    in an independent measurement , using a laser with a wavelength of 1550  nm ( hamamatsu plp-01 ) , the total transmittivity of the optical components after the waveguide was found to be @xmath48 .",
    "the obtained overall transmittivity for the down - converted photons in our setup is thus @xmath49 .    using the experimental parameters @xmath11 = 800 000 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 together with any of the photon - pair distributions ( [ eq : sqvacdistr ] ) , ( [ eq : thermdistr ] ) , or ( [ eq : poidistr ] ) , the corresponding theoretical curves given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) and ( [ eq : c ] ) can be fitted to the experimental data by varying the unknown parameter @xmath21 or @xmath30 .",
    "we have used relative weighting for determining the best curve fits .",
    "hence , we have minimized expressions of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the experimental and theoretical value , respectively , for a given pump power . in this way",
    ", the single - count and coincidence - count errors can be treated simultaneously , even though their values are very different .",
    "for single degenerate and nondegenerate processes , we obtain the values @xmath56",
    "mw@xmath1 and @xmath57  mw@xmath1 , respectively . assuming a poissonian photon - pair distribution , the errors are minimized for @xmath58  mw@xmath1 .    , width=491 ]",
    "the experimental results and the curve fits are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] .",
    "since the measured count rates were far below saturation of the detectors , we have simply subtracted the dark - count rates @xmath59  s@xmath1 and @xmath60  s@xmath1 from the raw single - count data to obtain @xmath61 and @xmath7 , respectively . by measuring the coincidence counts when one of the two beams after the beam splitter was blocked , the dark - count - induced coincidence rate @xmath62 was experimentally verified .",
    "subtracting it from the raw coincidence data thus gave us the true coincidence - count rate @xmath8 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] .",
    "the poissonian photon - pair distribution is seen to fit well to the experimental data .",
    "the best curve fits for a single degenerate and a single nondegenerate spdc process are considerably worse , the former in particular .",
    "the reasons for these differences will be discussed below .",
    "the poissonian photon - pair distribution can be theoretically justified by comparing the coherence time of the pump @xmath63 with that of the down - converted light @xmath64 , as was recently discussed by de riedmatten _",
    "we expect the coherence length of the laser to be close to the pulse length , that is , @xmath65  ps . the generated photon pairs on the other hand , have a wide spectrum and the coherence length of the detected photons should therefore be determined by the 30-nm filter .",
    "we here follow the reasoning in ref .",
    "@xcite , but offer some more detailed arguments .",
    "let us assume that the spectrum of the light transmitted through the filter can be approximated with a gaussian function , whose fwhm is given by the corresponding wavelengths of the filter .",
    "for a general filter , these wavelengths are given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the filter s central wavelength and fwhm bandwidth , respectively .",
    "expressed in the angular frequency @xmath69 , the spectrum is thus assumed to satisfy @xmath70 ^ 2 \\ln 2}{\\pi^2 ( f_1 - f_2)^2 } \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the speed of light in vacuum . assuming that the down - converted light pulses are transform limited ,",
    "the temporal fwhm of the pulse s intensity @xmath74 , and the fwhm of the spectrum @xmath75 , are related according to @xmath76 . approximating the coherence length of the pulses with the fwhm of their intensity , we thus arrive at @xmath77 usually @xmath78 , in which case",
    "we recover the relation @xmath79 given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherencetime ] , we have plotted the coherence time as a function of the filter bandwidth for different central wavelengths of the filter . as @xmath80  nm and @xmath81  nm for our filter , the coherence time is found to be @xmath82  fs . we thus have @xmath83 , which results in a poissonian photon - pair distribution @xcite .",
    "we also note that since the detected down - converted light has a spectral width of 30  nm , which is considerably wider than that of the pump , the observed process can not be degenerate . in light of this",
    ", it appears natural that a single nondegenerate process gives a better curve fit than a single degenerate one , as found in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] .    ]",
    "according to the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherencetime ] , we can obtain @xmath84 with the present source , if a very narrow filter with a bandwidth of about one tenth of a nanometer is used .",
    "we would then expect the photon - pair distribution to be given by a single degenerate or nondegenerate spdc process , which would increase the ratio between coincidence and single counts .",
    "however , due to the use of such a narrow filter , the count rates would then be much smaller .",
    "also , even if the filter is centered around the frequency for degenerate down - conversion , the photon distribution may be affected by the spectral width of the pump in this case .",
    "in table  [ tab : comparison ] , our experimental results obtained at the maximum average pump power of 50  @xmath0w are presented . here",
    ", @xmath85 is the average single - count rate for the two detectors , and @xmath86 denotes the peak pump power . for comparison ,",
    "results of previous studies carried out at 1550  nm are also listed .",
    "semiconductor and ti : sapphire pump lasers have been abbreviated as sc and ti : s , respectively .",
    "the photon - pair sources used in the earlier experiments were : a ppln - wg @xcite , four wave mixing ( fwm ) in a dispersion - shifted fiber ( dsf ) @xcite , a periodically poled silica fiber ( ppsf ) @xcite , and a ppln bulk crystal @xcite .",
    "since the contribution to the maximum coincidence - count rate from independent photon pairs and dark counts is unknown in the experiments with a cw pump @xcite , the accidental coincidence - count rate ( measured with a long delay between the two detector signals ) has been subtracted to obtain the values of @xmath8 in these cases . as a simple measure of the efficiency of the different setups",
    ", we have calculated the probability of a coincidence count divided by the average pump power and the repetition rate in the bottom line of table  [ tab : comparison ] . due to the high conversion efficiency of the ppln - wg and the high peak intensity of the pulsed laser ,",
    "the highest value is obtained in the present experiment .",
    "however , the coincidence rate is low for a practical qkd system . assuming an average of @xmath87 generated photon pairs per pulse , which is the value most frequently adopted in qkd experiments , and obtained at a pump power of @xmath88  @xmath0w in the present experiment , the resulting coincidence rate is only @xmath89  s@xmath1 .",

    "secondly , the repetition rate can be increased . in our experiment ,",
    "we were limited to 800  khz by the delay / pulse generator . for repetition rates exceeding 1  mhz , the effects of afterpulsing have to be considered @xcite , but a repetition rate of 10  mhz with negligible afterpulse probability has recently been achieved using discharge - pulse counting @xcite .",
    "thirdly , it is possible to improve the coupling of the down - converted light into the single - mode fiber @xcite . in this first experiment ,",
    "the optics was not optimized and resulted in an estimated fiber - coupling efficiency of only 25% .",
    "fourthly , the useful coincidence rate can be increased by using a qpm device that generates nondegenerate photon pairs , whose two photons are of easily separable frequencies @xcite",
    ". as our photon pairs are close to degenerate , we have to perform beam splitting in order to simultaneously detect the two constituting photons .",
    "this reduces the number of coincidence counts by half compared to the distinctly nondegenerate case , in which the photons can be separated efficiently by a prism , dichroic mirror , or wavelength division multiplexing module .",
    "moreover , with an appropriate qpm device , the signal and idler photons can have very different wavelengths .",
    "if the signal wavelength is short enough , a highly efficient si - based detector with low dark count can be used to detect the signal photons , and thereby the signal - to - noise ratio can be improved drastically @xcite .    using ingaas / inp detectors and the improvements above , the values @xmath95 , @xmath96  mhz , and @xmath97 are feasible .",
    "if we further assume that no beam splitting is necessary , the coincidence rate becomes @xmath98 14 000  s@xmath1 as the average number of generated photon pairs is @xmath87 .",
    "we have shown that a ppln - wg is a highly efficient source of photon pairs at 1550  nm . in the present experiment ,",
    "the coincidence rate was found to be too low for a practical qkd system , but we have argued that a reasonable rate is within reach of present technology . with these improvements",
    "the ppln - wg should be a suitable source for long - distance qkd system , since it can be pumped by a cheap semiconductor laser , and light at the single - photon level can be generated in the minimum - loss window of common optical fibers .",
    "our measurements also suggest that the down - converted light can be described by a poissonian photon - pair distribution , which is in accordance with theory . using the value @xmath58 mw@xmath1 obtained through curve fitting",
