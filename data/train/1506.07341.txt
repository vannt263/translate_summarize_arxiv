    "this paper is a sequel to @xcite and part of @xcite : in @xcite , david gepner and i set up a theory of _ enriched _ , using a non - symmetric variant of lurie s theory of , and in @xcite*5 i constructed a double @xmath2 of associative algebra objects in a monoidal @xmath3 , with the two kinds of 1-morphism given by algebra homomorphisms and bimodules .",
    "the goal of this paper is to construct a `` many - object '' analogue of this double : in @xcite we defined enriched as algebras for `` many - object associative operads '' , and there is an analogous extension of the definition of bimodules in @xcite using `` many - object bimodule operads '' . using this definition we extend the constructions of @xcite to get our main result :    let @xmath3 be a monoidal compatible with small colimits .",
    "then there exists a double @xmath4 of @xmath3-enriched , with the two kinds of 1-morphism given by bimodules and functors .",
    "moreover , if @xmath3 is an @xmath5-monoidal , then @xmath4 inherits a natural @xmath6-monoidal structure .",
    "we ll construct this double in  [ sec : double ] and discuss its functoriality and monoidal structures in  [ sec : func ] .",
    "we can also restrict the objects of this double to those @xmath3- that are _ complete _ , i.e. local with respect to the fully faithful and essentially surjective functors , to obtain the double @xmath7 , which we regard as the `` correct '' double of @xmath3- .",
    " this is a consequence of the yoneda lemma , which we hope to prove in a sequel to this paper . ]",
    "the double @xmath4 has two underlying @xmath1-categories , with the 1-morphisms given either by bimodules or by functors . in the latter case",
    ", we would expect the 2-morphisms to be _",
    "natural transformations_. the second main result of this paper is that this is indeed the case : we will use the obvious notion of a natural transformation of functors between @xmath3- @xmath8 and @xmath9 , namely a functor @xmath10 \\to \\mathcal{d}$ ] , to define a segal space @xmath11 of @xmath3-functors , and show :    let @xmath12 be the @xmath1-category ( in the sense of a 2-fold segal space ) underlying @xmath4 with functors as 1-morphisms .",
    "there is a natural equivalence between @xmath11 and the segal space @xmath13 of maps from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in @xmath4 .",
    "we ll prove this in  [ sec : infty2 ] .",
    "if @xmath9 is complete we will also observe that the segal space @xmath11 is complete for any @xmath8 , so as a consequence we obtain that the 2-fold segal space @xmath14 underlying @xmath7 with functors as 1-morphisms is complete .",
    "in ordinary enriched category theory the notion of bimodule is classical , and according to the @xmath15lab was invented independently by a number of people back in the 1960s , though with much of their theory introduced by bnabou .",
    "the specific definition of a bimodule between enriched @xmath0-categories we consider here was , however , inspired by the `` external '' notion of bimodule given by bacard in @xcite in the context of a model - categorical approach to weakly enriched categories .    to motivate this paper ,",
    "let s now briefly consider some future directions in which i hope to extend the results proved here :    * in @xcite*6 i constructed @xmath16-categories of @xmath6-algebras in @xmath6-monoidal .",
    "similarly , i hope to construct @xmath16-categories of enriched @xmath17-categories also for @xmath18  these are expected to be the targets for a number of interesting topological quantum field theories .",
    "* in @xcite*4.6.3 lurie proves that all associative algebras are dualizable in the of algebras and bimodules",
    ". this should extend to a proof that all enriched are dualizable , which will lead to a definition of _ topological hochschild homology _ for enriched .",
    "similarly , the proof in @xcite*4.6.4 that the 2-dualizable algebras are precisely the smooth and proper ones should extend to a characterization of the 2-dualizable enriched . * for ordinary enriched categories , a bimodule between @xmath19-categories @xmath20 and @xmath21 is often defined as a functor from @xmath22 to the self - enrichment of @xmath19 .",
    "the same should be true for the bimodules we consider here : the of @xmath8-@xmath9-bimodules in @xmath3 should be a representable functor of @xmath8 , with the representing object being @xmath3-valued enriched presheaves on @xmath9 .",
    "this can be thought of as a form of the _ yoneda lemma _ for enriched .",
    "( in particular , the more obvious formulation that there is a fully faithful yoneda embedding into enriched presheaves would be an easy consequence of this . ) * classically , the double category of @xmath19-enriched categories , functors , and bimodules is an example of a _ proarrow equipment_. this is an abstract context in which one can define weighted ( co)limits and kan extensions . an analogous theory can be developed in the context , with the double we construct here as a key example .",
    "combined with the yoneda lemma , which gives a checkable criterion for a bimodule to be represented by a functor , this should give very useful tools for making interesting constructions and in general `` doing category theory '' with enriched ( with a particularly interesting case here being @xmath17-categories ) .      in  [ sec",
    ": nsop ] we review some key notions and results from the theory of non - symmetric , and in  [ sec : enr ] we briefly recall the main definitions and results on enriched from @xcite that we ll make use of . then in  [ sec : bimod ] we introduce our definition of bimodules between enriched , and motivate it by relating it to the classical notion of a bimodule for enriched categories .",
    "next we discuss , in ",
    "[ sec : compose ] , how to compose these bimodules , and observe that this is analogous to the composition of bimodules for ordinary enriched categories .",
    "after these introductory sections we then get to work in  [ sec : double ] , where we construct the double of enriched . in ",
    "[ sec : nattr ] we consider the obvious definition of natural transformations in this context and show these are the 1-morphisms in an of enriched functors , and then we compare this to the mapping of functors coming from our double in  [ sec : infty2 ] .",
    "finally we discuss the functoriality of the double and their natural monoidal structures in  [ sec : func ] .",

    "this also seems an appropiate occasion to thank david gepner for steering me away from a truly atrocious approach to defining of functors between enriched back in 2012 .",
