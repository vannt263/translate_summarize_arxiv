    "x - ray astronomy has advanced significantly in recent years because of improved x - ray instrumentation .",
    "several recent x - ray satellites provided complementary capabilities : high spatial resolution and mapping of the entire sky ( rosat ) , spatially - resolved spectroscopy ( asca ) , and broad - band coverage ( _ beppo_sax ) . in the field of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , this has led to many advances , such as the discovery of the nonthermal synchrotron x - ray emission produced by energetic electrons accelerated at a shock front , identification of a number of new neutron stars and associated synchrotron nebulae , discovery of new snrs , and identification of young , ejecta - dominated snrs .",
    "spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy , provided by the asca satellite , played a crucial role in these discoveries .",
    "the asca database now contains a large number of excellent spectra of snrs .",
    "observations with the next generation of x - ray satellites ( _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ ) have begun to provide even better quality data , ensuring continuing progress in the snr research .",
    "while the new x - ray observations led to significant progress , x - ray spectral data on snrs , and asca data in particular , have been mostly underutilized .",
    "the fundamental reason for this unsatisfactory situation is that x - ray emitting plasmas in snrs are not in ionization equilibrium , significantly complicating analysis of their x - ray spectra . until recently most x - ray observers",
    "have not had access even to simple nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) models .",
    "the simplest nei model consists of an impulsively heated , uniform and homogeneous gas , initially cold and neutral .",
    "while this constant temperature , single - ionization timescale model is often used in analysis of x - ray spectra of snrs , in most cases it is unlikely to be a good approximation to shock - heated plasmas in snrs .",
    "because x - ray spectra are sensitive to the detailed structure of a snr , the best description of snr spectra is through hydrodynamical modeling , coupled with x - ray emission calculations .",
    "this approach is obviously impractical in most cases . that leaves idealized hydrodynamical structures , such as self - similar hydrodynamical solutions , as the best choice for general nei models .",
    "the sedov - taylor self - similar solution , describing a point blast explosion in a uniform ambient medium , is the most well - known and useful of such structures .",
    "x - ray emission calculations for the sedov models have been performed numerous times in the past , with the most extensive set of calculations presented by hamilton , sarazin , &  chevalier ( 1983 ) .",
    "the shape of the x - ray spectrum , spatially integrated over the whole remnant , depends on the shock speed @xmath0 , the ionization timescale @xmath1 ( which we define as the product of the remnant s age @xmath2 and the postshock electron number density @xmath3 ) , and the extent of electron heating at the shock front .",
    "in addition , as typical for most x - ray emitting thermal plasmas , line strengths and to a lesser extent continua depend on heavy - element abundances .",
    "sedov models have been recalculated using updated atomic data ( kaastra &  jansen 1993 ) and successfully applied to modeling of x - ray spectra of snrs in the large magellanic cloud ( hughes , hayashi , &  koyama 1998 ) .",
    "the most uncertain aspect of x - ray modeling in the framework of the sedov model is the extent of electron heating in a blast wave . because of",
    "the low densities typical for the interstellar medium ( ism ) , shocks in the ism are collisionless , where the ordered ion kinetic energy is dissipated into random thermal motions through collisionless interactions involving magnetic fields .",
    "electrons , whose collisions with ions produce the observed x - ray emission from snrs , are most likely also heated to some degree in collisionless shocks , but the details of this process are not well understood . in the extreme case of a very high mach - number shock , in the shock frame",
    "both electrons and ions enter with the shock velocity @xmath0 , so that after randomization one expects @xmath4 and @xmath5 , that is , @xmath6 , unless some collisionless heating of electrons ( at the expense of ions ) also occurs .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "( 1983 ) considered two extreme possibilities , either full electron ",
    "ion equilibration at the shock front , or electron heating only through coulomb collisions in the postshock gas , without any collisionless heating at the front itself .",
    "hughes et al . (",
    "1998 ) used these two limiting classes of models in their modeling of lmc snrs , and found better ( but not perfect ) agreement for models without any collisionless heating .",
    "while these results suggest that the full electron  ion equipartition might not hold in snrs , the extent of collisionless electron heating remains an open question .",
    "these questions are critical for observations since both the x - ray continuum and lines originate from electrons : from electron bremsstrahlung or electron impact excitation of ions . until x - ray observations are able to resolve thermal doppler widths of emission lines , ion energy remains invisible except as a pool from which to heat electrons .",
    "the detailed shape of the electron distribution affects both continuum and line emission .",
    "this introduces another potential problem : the possible deviation of the electron energy distribution function from a maxwellian distribution , in particular the presence of a high - energy tail .",
    "electrons in such a tail might modify the high - energy x - ray spectrum of a snr through interactions with ions and magnetic fields .",
    "theoretical modeling of collisionless shocks , performed with the purpose of accounting for the observed intensity and properties of galactic cosmic rays , revealed that energetic particles generated within the shock should strongly modify the shock structure .",
    "such cosmic - ray modified shocks transfer a significant amount of kinetic energy into cosmic rays , which then diffuse upstream of the original shock and partially decelerate incoming gas in a region ahead of it ( the shock precursor ) .",
    "the temperature of the thermal gas is much lower than in a standard ( nonmodified ) shock with the same velocity , because of this efficient transfer of kinetic energy into cosmic rays .",
    "this will affect x - rays produced by thermal plasmas in cosmic - ray modified shocks , because of strong dependence of x - ray emission on gas temperature .",
    "the modeling of modified shocks has been usually done in the framework of steady - state , plane - parallel shocks , preventing a direct comparison with the sedov model discussed above .",
    "such a comparison is now possible , as time - dependent , cosmic - ray modified shock models have been constructed recently by berezhko , yelshin , &  ksenofontov ( 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "the continuing improvement in theory just described is not followed by a similar improvement in the x - ray data analysis . instead of using sedov models ( and even more sophisticated hydrodynamical models , including those with cosmic - ray modified shocks )",
    ", many observers still rely on the ionization equilibrium models , which are generally not acceptable for snrs .",
    "sometimes spectra are modeled by gaussian lines and free - free continua , a purely phenomenological approach which does not allow for determination of physical parameters in x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the frequently used constant temperature , single ionization timescale nei model is better than an equilibrium plasma model , but it is still not appropriate for snrs . in order to make full advantage of current and future x - ray data on snrs .",
    "a concentrated effort is required to close the gap between the relatively sophisticated theory and the current crude data analysis .",
    "the theoretical work described here focuses on a most basic set of models which is necessary for analysis of x - ray data , and which should be routinely used by x - ray observers .",
    "we present new calculations of spatially - integrated x - ray emission from sedov models in ",
    "2 , allowing for partial electron heating at a shock front .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was presented in lyerly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in   3 , we discuss our results in terms of suitably chosen temperature and ionization timescale distribution functions , and compare sedov models with simpler nei models such as a single timescale , constant temperature model or a plane - parallel shock .",
    "the sensitivity of x - ray spectra to model parameters is discussed in   4 .",
    "we present a summary of our results in ",
    "we base our spectral calculations on a sedov - taylor ( st ) blast wave model .",
    "the st model begins with a spherically symmetric point blast expanding adiabatically into a uniform ambient medium with the adiabatic index @xmath7 .",
    "only the shocked ism is considered in the st model .",
    "therefore , the shocked ism mass must significantly outweigh the mass of the material ejected by the supernova ( sn ) , usually at an age of a few thousand years .",
    "the governing parameters of this phase of snr evolution are the initial energy of the blast @xmath8 , the density of the ambient medium @xmath9 , and the time since the explosion @xmath2 .",
    "these parameters can be easily arranged to form a unit of length , related to the shock radius by @xmath10 .",
    "these three initial parameters completely determine the dynamics of a sedov model .",
    "for example , we might choose an initial energy of @xmath11 ergs , an upstream hydrogen number density @xmath12 @xmath13 , and a time @xmath2 of @xmath14 seconds , yielding a radius of @xmath15 cm .",
    "we now know the shock speed , @xmath16 , and also the postshock values of pressure , density , and velocity through the rankine - hugoniot shock conditions .",
    "the self - similar analytical solution ( sedov 1946 ; taylor 1950 ) gives the pressure , density and velocity profiles behind the shock , and it allows us to find pressure and density variations as a function of time for each fluid element .",
    "this information is necessary for determination of the ionization state for each ion species .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "( 1983 ) showed that the shape of the x - ray spectrum of a spatially - integrated sedov model does not depend on all three parameters mentioned above , but only on shock velocity @xmath0 ( or alternatively shock temperature @xmath17 kev ) and parameter @xmath18 .",
    "( we have assumed cosmic - abundance plasma , where electrons are provided by fully ionized h and he , with a negligible contribution from heavier elements .",
    "the mean mass per particle @xmath19 is then equal to 0.6 in units of @xmath20 . ) in order to simplify comparison with other nei models , we use ionization timescale @xmath1 instead of @xmath21 , where we define @xmath1 as the product of the postshock electron density @xmath3 and the remnant s age @xmath2 .",
    "note that for cosmic - abundance plasma and the strong shock rankine - hugoniot jump conditions , @xmath22 . from equation ( 4b ) in hamilton",
    "( 1983 ) , ionization timescale @xmath1 is equal to @xmath23 @xmath13 s , where @xmath24 ergs @xmath25 and @xmath26 k. x - ray spectra depend also on electron temperature @xmath27 which is discussed next .",
    "vs emission measure @xmath28 ( both normalized to 1 at the shock ) , for sedov model with @xmath29  k , @xmath30 @xmath13 s , and with full ion - electron equipartition ( @xmath31 ; _ solid curve _ ) , no collisionless heating of electron at the shock ( _ dotted curve _ ) , and partial electron heating at the shock with the postshock electron temperature @xmath32  k ( _ dashed curve _ ) . , width=288 ]     to the mean gas temperature @xmath33 vs emission measure @xmath28 , for the sedov model with the same @xmath34 and @xmath1 as in figure  1 , but with various amounts of collisionless heating ( @xmath35 ranges from 0.0 at the bottom to 0.9 at the top ) .",
    ", width=288 ]      the mean gas temperature @xmath33 in sedov models is plotted in figure  [ electemp ] as a function of the normalized emission measure @xmath36 .",
    "( because we assumed normal abundances , with a cosmic h / he ratio and a negligible contribution to electron density from elements heavier than he , models and calculations discussed in this work are not applicable to heavy - element plasmas where these assumptions break down . )",
    "@xmath33 is equal to the shock temperature @xmath34 at the shock ( @xmath37 ) , and increases toward the remnant s interior .",
    "but for calculations of x - ray spectra we need to know the electron temperature @xmath27 , which in general is not equal to either the mean temperature @xmath33 or the ion temperature @xmath38 .",
    "these three temperature are equal only if electrons and ions are equilibrated at the shock front through plasma instabilities generated within the collisionless plasma . because kinetic energy is initially transferred to thermal motions of ions in collisionless shocks , full equilibration demands the presence of a very efficient mechanism for transfer of energy from ions to electrons in collisionless shocks , at all shock mach numbers .",
    "this is unlikely based on available observational and theoretical evidence . for example , observations of ultaviolet ( uv ) lines from a fast nonradiative shock in sn 1006 ( laming et al .",
    "1996 ) suggest that there is little energy transfer from ions to electrons in shocks where neutral h is present ahead of the shock front . in an extreme case of a very inefficient heating of electrons at the shock ,",
    "the postshock electron temperature @xmath39 is much less than the postshock ion temperature @xmath40 , and the ratio @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) is close to 0 .",
    "electrons are then heated mostly in coulomb collisions with ions in the hot shocked plasma downstream of the shock front .",
    "the most general situation , most likely to happen in snrs shocks , is that electrons are partially heated in collisionless shocks and additional coulomb heating occurs downstream of the shock",
    ".    the extent of electron heating in shocks can be parametrized by the temperature ratio @xmath43 , which can vary from nearly @xmath44 in shocks with negligible collisionless heating to @xmath45 when this heating is very efficient . in general",
    ", @xmath35 might depend on the shock mach number and other shock parameters , possibly decreasing with increasing shock mach number ( bykov &  uvarov 1999 ) .",
    "this inverse correlation with the shock mach number is supported by most recent observational evidence based on optical observations of nonradiative shocks ( ghavamian 1999 ; ghavamian et al .",
    "because of the poor understanding of electron heating in collisionless shocks , which may depend not only on the shock mach number but also on other shock parameters such as the magnetic field orientation , we neglect dependence of @xmath35 on shock parameters , i. e. , we assume that @xmath35 does not vary during the snr evolution .",
    "the validity of this assumption is questionable , and should be examined in more detail once good quality spatially - resolved x - ray spectra of snrs become available .",
    "once a value of @xmath35 is chosen , we can calculate the electron temperature @xmath27 in sedov models using the procedure described by borkowski , sarazin , & blondin ( 1994 ) , which takes into account coulomb heating in the shocked plasma .",
    "( the formula ( @xmath46 ) in this paper contains a typographical error ; the second term on the right hand side of this expression should be replaced by @xmath47 . )",
    "the electron temperature @xmath27 of a fluid element depends on its location within the remnant , on @xmath39 and @xmath34 ( hence on @xmath35 ) , and on the snr ionization timescale @xmath1 .",
    "the extreme case of inefficient electron heating at the shock is shown in figure  [ electemp ] for a sedov model with @xmath29  k and @xmath48  k ( @xmath49 ) , and @xmath30 @xmath13 s. the electron temperature rises from 0 at the shock ( @xmath37 ) to an asymptotic finite value at the snr center ( @xmath50 ) , the behaviour already noted by itoh ( 1978 , 1979 ) and gronenschild & mewe ( 1979 ) in their numerical simulations and discussed in more detail by cox & anderson ( 1982 ) and hamilton et al .",
    "this is in contrast to very high electron temperatures in the interior of models with efficient heating ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is obvious that models with inefficient electron heating differ greatly from models with efficient heating .",
    "another solution , with intermediate @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and the same @xmath30 @xmath13 s , is also shown in figure  [ electemp ] .",
    "the relative importance of coulomb heating and collisionless heating in the sedov model just discussed can be inferred from figure  [ electempn ] , where we plot the ratio of electron temperature @xmath27 to the mean temperature @xmath33 for a number of different values of parameter @xmath35 . for large @xmath35 ,",
    "the curves are nearly straight parallel lines , with relatively unimportant coulomb heating .",
    "the electron temperature profiles in these models are nearly the same as in the sedov model with @xmath52 , except for the overall temperature scaling which is proportional to @xmath35 . at low @xmath35 , the coulomb heating dominates , resulting in highly curved lines .",
    "the efficiency of the coulomb heating increases with increasing @xmath55 ( itoh 1978 ) , where @xmath56 is the total particle density of a fluid element , @xmath57 is the time elapsed since this element was shocked by the blast wave , and @xmath33 is the mean temperature of this fluid element . at the blast wave and",
    "in the remnant s interior , @xmath55 is small , so that the coulomb heating is less efficient there than inside the swept shell .",
    "this is why the curves in figure  [ electempn ] attain a maximum at @xmath58 and drop to 0 for @xmath50 and  1 .",
    "note that because of the scaling just mentioned , these curves are identical for all sedov models with the same value of @xmath59 .     to the mean gas temperature @xmath33 vs emission measure @xmath28 , for the sedov model with @xmath60 ergs @xmath25 , at five different times ( increasing from bottom to top ) .",

    "the effects of varying @xmath59 are shown in figure  [ electempeta ] for the same parameter @xmath21 as in figures  [ electemp ] and  [ electempn ] , but at different times in the remnant s evolution ( 1/4 , 1/2 , 1 , 2 , and 4 of @xmath63 @xmath13 s ) .",
    "the requirement of constant @xmath21 demands that @xmath34 is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "two cases of @xmath49 and 0.5 are shown . at early times , the fast collisionless heating in a model with @xmath65 dominates the coulomb heating , leading to very different electron temperature profiles than for @xmath49 .",
    "this is the case discussed until now .",
    "the temperature profiles become similar at later stages in the remnant s evolution , depending rather weakly on @xmath35 , because of the increased role of the coulomb energy transfer . at @xmath66 @xmath13 s ( curves at the top of figure  [ electempeta ] ) ,",
    "noticeable differences are seen only in the remnant s interior , where densities are low and temperatures are high , leading to a long electron - ion equlibration time scale .",
    "note again that these temperature profiles are identical for all sedov models with the same values of @xmath59 and @xmath35 .",
    "the ionization state of each fluid element depends on its ionization timescale @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the time when this fluid element was shocked , and on how the electron temperature @xmath27 varied as a function of its ionization time scale , from 0 to @xmath69 , during the remnant s evolution .",
    "the normalized ionization timescale @xmath70 is plotted in figure  [ ionizdistr ] .",
    "it starts at zero at the shock ( @xmath37 ) , then increases linearly in the swept snr shell , but in the remnant s interior it is again small because of low gas densities there .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath69 is quite broad , and is poorly represented by a @xmath71 function ( the approximation involved in using a single - ionization - timescale nei model ) .",
    "the most highly ionized atomic species are usually found near the maximum of @xmath69 , while the least ionized material is found just behind the shock and in the remnant s interior .",
    "we determined the electron temperature as a function of @xmath69 for each fluid element following the procedure described above .",
    "we tracked the ionic states in each fluid element by solving the time - dependent ionization equations for each abundant element ( c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , fe , and ni ) . we used an eigenfunction method to solve these equations efficiently ( masai 1984 , hughes &  helfand 1985 , kaastra &  jansen 1993 , borkowski et al .",
    "physical processes included in these calculations are collisional ionizations by electrons , both direct and involving excitations followed by autoionizations , and radiative and dielectronic recombinations .",
    "we used collisional ionization rates from arnaud &  raymond ( 1992 ) for fe , and from lennon et al .",
    "( 1987 ) for other elements .",
    "we also updated recombination rates in the hamilton &  sarazin ( 1984 ) x - ray code .",

    "recombination rates for fe ions were taken from arnaud &  raymond ( 1992 ) . except for h and he , all elements are assumed to be neutral initially , a good approximation under most circumstances because of the insensitivity of x - ray spectra to the detailed ionization state of preshock plasma .",

    "modeling x - ray spectra of snrs within the framework of sedov models demands an efficient interface between observations and the calculated model spectra .",

    "it should be obvious that , in general , _ it is necessary to consider not only the extremes of very efficient and completely inefficient electron heating , but also models with partial electron heating at the shock_.    differences between x - ray spectra of sedov models with different amounts of collisionless heating become smaller as the remnant ages , because of the increased role of the coulomb heating in older remnants without full electron - ion equilibration at the shock front ( see figure  [ electempeta ] ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ spectr259 ] , where there is hardly any difference between the coolest models with and without collisionless heating .",
    "most of the x - ray emitting plasma in these models is actually not very far from coronal equilibrium ionization .",
    "x - ray and uv spectra of stellar coronae showed the presence of multi - temperature hot plasmas , which led researchers to consider temperature distribution functions in their efforts to understand the observed coronal spectra .",
    "this approach proved quite useful in analysis of x - ray spectra of stellar coronae .",
    "it would be advantageous to have a similar framework available for snrs , so we generalized the idea of the temperature distribution function used for plasmas in ionization equlibrium to nei sedov models",
    ".      the spatially - integrated x - ray spectra for sedov models can be succesfully interpreted in terms of the following three distributions : the electron temperature , ionization timescale , and ionization timescale - averaged electron temperature distribution functions .",
    "we have already shown the ionization timescale distribution in figure  [ ionizdistr ] , and examples of the electron temperature distribution in figure  [ electemp ] .",
    "these two distributions do not contain enough information to determine ionic states , because of the adiabatic expansion of the gas following its passage through the blast wave .",
    "this expansion results in a decreasing mean temperature for each fluid element .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ addfig ] , where we plot temperature variations for several fluid elements in the sedov model .",
    "particularly large variations are seen for fluid elements which were shocked early in the remnant s evolution .",
    "another reason for electron temperature variations is energy transfer from ions to electrons in models with unequal ion and electron temperature . in principle",
    "a detailed account of the electron temperature variations is needed for each fluid element , just as we did for sedov models , but a simpler approach in terms of an average temperature provides a better insight while maintaining good accuracy .",
    "a suitable average electron temperature is the ionization timescale - averaged temperature @xmath81 , defined as @xmath82 . in figure",
    "[ avrgte ] , we plot the ratio @xmath83 for sedov models with @xmath29  k , @xmath30 @xmath13 s , and various amounts of collisionless electron heating . for equal ion and electron temperatures this ratio is significantly greater than unity in the remnant s interior because of the adiabatic expansion . in the opposite limit of no collisionless heating ,",
    "@xmath81 is slightly less than @xmath27 in the postshock region , because the efficient transfer of energy from ions to electrons more than compensates for adiabatic expansion .",
    "however , even in this case the temperature ratio becomes larger than unity in the remnant s interior , demonstrating the effectiveness of the adiabatic expansion . after passing through the shock front , electrons in a fluid element",
    "are heated by coulomb collisions with ions , but because of the adiabatic expansion the efficiency of coulomb heating decreases , and the electron temperature attains a maximum and then starts to decline with time .",
    "even modest amounts of collisionless heating affect the ionization timescale averaged distribution function in the remnant s interior and at the shock front ( fig .",
    "[ avrgte ] ) , where the ionization timescale is low and the coulomb heating is least effective ( fig .  [ electempn ] ) .",

    "the fits are perfect early in the remnant s evolution , at high shock temperatures , but they deteriorate as the blast wave decelerates . particularly large differences are seen at high energies , where the shock model spectrum is too soft .",

    "an inadequate representation of the distribution functions is the reason why single ionization timescale nei models in general , and plane - parallel shocks at low shock speeds , fail to reproduce x - ray spectra of sedov models . in the latter ,",
    "it is the presence of multitemperature plasma in sedov models ( see figures  [ electemp ] and  [ avrgte ] ) which is responsible for this failure .",

    "for this reason we advocate the use of full sedov models , and not multi - zone models , in modeling of spatially - integrated x - ray spectra of snrs , because sedov models represent a simple physical situation of a spherical blast wave propagating into a uniform ambient medium . however , multi - zone models most likely will be very useful in spatially - resolved x - ray spectral modeling of snrs .",
    "there are three parameters of sedov models which may be determined from spatially integrated x - ray spectra : postshock temperature @xmath34 , postshock electron temperature @xmath39 , and the ionization age @xmath1 ( plus chemical abundances which we do not discuss here ) .",
    "it is generally difficult to determine all three parameters , particularly when observations are available only in a limited x - ray spectral range or when deviations from the sedov dynamics are present .",
    "we will first consider two limiting cases of young and hot , and much older and cooler snrs .    when young and hot remnants are observed in the 0.1  10 kev spectral range , such as provided by the _",
    "ccds , most of the emission comes from the bulk of the x - ray emitting material , with emission measures between 0.1  1.0 , located behind the blast wave . because of the low ionization timescales characteristic of young remnants , the electron temperature distribution function is generally flat and has a similar shape for models with various amounts of electron heating in this range of emission measures ( see figures  [ electemp ] and  [ electempn ] ) .",
    "the ionization timescale averaged electron temperature distributions are also similar ( figure  [ avrgte ] ) , while the ionization timescale distributions are of course identical and reasonably well approximated by a straight line ( figure  [ ionizdistr ] ) .",
    "we have already shown that under these conditions plane parallel shocks with constant electron temperature provide an excellent approximation to sedov models in the 0.1  10 kev energy range .",
    "this demonstrates that the observed x - ray spectrum depends mostly on the mean electron temperature in the postshock region and on the ionization timescale @xmath1 .",
    "it is difficult to determine @xmath34 and @xmath39 separately without additional information .",
    "observations at higher energies , which would probe interior regions where the temperature distribution functions differ between the models ( see figure  [ electemp ] ) , are not likely to succeed because of expected severe deviations from the sedov dynamics in the interior regions of young remnants .",
    "it is possible to determine independently the shock speeds in young remnants through high spectral resolution observations .",
    "the postshock radial velocity of the bulk of the x - ray emitting material is equal to @xmath113 , which results in a velocity difference of @xmath114 between the front and back section of the shell at the remnant s center . with a sufficient spectral resolution ,",
    "doppler - shifted spectral lines originating in these two shell sections could be separated , providing us with the missing information about the shock speed .",
    "this straightforward kinematic measurement is currently hard to accomplish because of the lack of x - ray instrumentation with a sufficiently high spectral resolution for spatially - extended sources such as snrs .",
    "such measurements would provide us with the shock temperature , which in combination with the analysis described above would allow for a complete determination of sedov model parameters .",
    "note that the high spectral resolution would also provide additional electron temperature and ionization timescale diagnostics based on individual line ratios .",
    "additional information about postshock velocities and postshock electron temperatures can also be independently found from optical and uv observations of nonradiative , balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "the width of the broad h@xmath73 component seen in these shocks is a direct measure of the postshock proton temperature . in combination with x - ray observations ,",
    "this is enough information to determine the shock speed in young remnants .",
    "in addition , uv and optical lines in such shocks are produced by electron impact excitation , ( although in the fastest shocks proton excitation might also be important ) , and carefully chosen line ratios can be good diagnostics of postshock electron temperatures . this is a poweful method for determining both temperatures from optical observations alone , although it is limited to shocks with a nonnegligible population of neutral h atoms entering the shock front .",
    "but for such fast nonradiative shocks one can find a complete set of shock parameters from optical , uv , and x - ray observations .",
    "in contrast to hot and young snrs just discussed , low shock temperatures and large ionization timescales in old remnants lead to efficient coulomb heating and ion - electron equilibration .",
    "departures from equilibration are important only in the immediate vicinity of the shock and in the remnant s interior ( e.g. , see top of figure  [ electempeta ] ) .",
    "spatially - integrated x - ray spectra for models with the same postshock temperature @xmath34 but different @xmath39 differ significantly only at high energies , as shown in figure  [ spectr259 ] for a model with @xmath115 kev and @xmath60 ergs @xmath25 .",
    "the postshock temperature @xmath34 and the ionization timescale @xmath1 ( or parameter @xmath21 ) can be obviously found from the shape of the x - ray spectrum at low energies . but determination of the postshock electron temperature @xmath39 must rely on the high - energy x - ray spectrum .",
    "the high - energy spectrum is produced by hot gas in the remnant s interior which was shocked early in the evolution of the remnant when departures from the sedov dynamics could be significant .",

    "for such remnants , determination of both @xmath34 and @xmath39 is best accomplished through spatially - resolved x - ray , uv , and optical spectroscopy in the narrow region immediately behind the shock front ( e. g. , see ghavamian 1999 ; ghavamian et al .",

( again , the calculated spectra were folded through the spectral response of the back - illuminated acis ccd detector . ) note that the plane - parallel shock model provides a poor approximation to these spectra because of the relatively low ( 0.6 kev ) postshock temperature .",
    "x - ray spectra for models with low values of @xmath1 show strong dependence on @xmath39 , particularly at high energies , because of the lack of ion - electron equilibration . for such remnants ,",
    "a simultaneous determination of @xmath34 and @xmath39 from spatially - integrated x - ray spectra should be possible . as the ionization timescale @xmath1 increases , coulomb heating becomes effective , and the effects of collisionless electron heating decrease in importance . for large ionization timescales @xmath1 , spectra in figure  [ spectr06 ] depend little on @xmath39 , and determination of @xmath39 becomes difficult .",
    "we discussed spatially - integrated x - ray spectra of snrs based on sedov dynamics .",
    "their spectral shape depends on elemental abundances and on three parameters : postshock temperature @xmath34 , postshock electron temperature @xmath39 , and ionization timescale @xmath1 ( or parameter @xmath21 ) .",
    "these three parameters can in principle be determined by comparing models with observations for any remnant , but frequently only one of the postshock temperatures can be found . only the postshock electron temperature @xmath39 can be usually determined for young , hot remnants , and only the shock temperature @xmath34 can be found for old , much colder snrs . in order to find both @xmath34 and @xmath39 for such snrs , additional information about the shock is necessary , such as available from kinematic studies or from uv and optical observations",
    ". it should be possible to determine both @xmath34 and @xmath39 from the spatially - integrated spectrum alone for snrs with intermediate temperatures and ionization timescales .",
    "we succesfully explained differences between x - ray spectra for sedov models with different parameters in terms of three distribution functions : the electron temperature distribution , the ionization timescale distribution , and the ionization - timescale averaged electron distribution .",
    "we then considered a number of simple models , such as a single ionization timescale model and plane - parallel shock models , and compared their distribution functions and x - ray spectra with sedov models .",
    "a frequently used single ionization timescale model was found to be an inappropriate approximation to sedov models . in most situations ,",
    "plane - parallel shocks provide a much better approximation to sedov models , and both plane shocks and sedov models should be routinely used in analysis of snr x - ray spectra .",
    "the nei models described in this work , while constituting a basic set of simplest thermal models , are not sufficient for interpretation of snr spectra .",
    "a single plane parallel or a spherical shock is a crude approximation to the complex morphology of snrs seen in x - ray images .",
    "for complex morphologies , observed x - ray spectra are most likely a superposition of shocks with various velocities , resulting in distribution functions which are poorly described by a single shock .",
    "in general , we do not expect that the nei models presented here can provide perfect or even statistically acceptable fits to snr spectra , because of deviations from an idealized plane shock or a sedov model .",
    "this is indeed the case for da 530 ( landecker et al . 1999 ) , 3c397 ( safi - harb et al .",
    "2000 ) and rcw 86 ( borkowski et al . 2000 ) , snrs whose x - ray spectra were modeled with plane shocks and sedov models .",
    "more effort is clearly necessary in order to take full advantage of x - ray observations of snrs .",
    "improved modeling must involve a superposition of shocks with various speeds or determination of distribution functions directly from observed x - ray spectra , a challenging task because of the modest spectral resolution of ccd detectors onboard _ chandra _ or xmm-_newton_.    we based our x - ray emission calculations on sedov - taylor dynamics , in which shocks are not modified by cosmic rays .",
    "but if collisionless shocks were strongly modified in snrs ( jones & ellison 1991 ) , then their dynamics would be poorly described by the sedov - taylor self - similar solution , and the resulting x - ray emission could be very different than in standard sedov models .",
    "dorfi & bhringer ( 1993 ) and more recently decourchelle , ellison , & ballet ( 2000 ) showed that the cosmic - ray modification of shock structure can indeed have a dramatic effect on x - ray spectra of snrs .",
    "this is not suprising because a significant amount of energy is deposited into relativistic particles in cosmic - ray dominated shocks , which results in lower temperatures of thermal gas . in several models calculated by berezhko et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) , the energy fraction contained in cosmic rays may be as high as 80%  of the total snr kinetic energy .",
    "we found that in such extreme cosmic - ray dominated snrs the thermal gas temperature is too low for production of substantial amounts of thermal x - ray emission , except early in the remnant s evolution when its dynamics and x - ray emission are strongly affected by sn ejecta .",
    "futhermore , we generally found flat temperature profiles in such models , because of a higher fraction of energy deposited into cosmic rays at higher shock velocities .",
    "such approximately isothermal snrs differ greatly from sedov models , which generally contain the hottest gas in their interiors . in terms of our distribution functions ,",
    "the electron temperature distribution is flat in these isothermal snrs , the ionization timescale is larger because of the increased postshock compression ratio , but the shape of the ionization timescale distribution is similar to that seen in figure  4 . because of adiabatic expansion , the ionization - timescale averaged temperature is qualitatively the same as depicted in figures  6 and  7 .",
    "these trends should be also present in other cosmic - ray modified snr models with lower particle acceleration efficiencies .",
    "a lower efficiency is actually possible because the idealized , spherically - symmetric models calculated by berezhko et al .",
    "assume a quasiparallel shock everywhere along its periphery , in which particle acceleration is most efficient .",
    "but realistic snr blast waves must consist of a mixture of quasiparallel and quasiperpendicular shocks , and in the absence of strong turbulence , quasi - perpendicular shocks may not accelerate particles as efficiently .",
    "it is then likely that `` only '' @xmath120%  of the snr kinetic energy is transferred to cosmic rays ( evgeny berezhko , private communication ) , in which case thermal gas will produce appreciable amounts of x - ray emission during the late adiabatic evolutionary stage of interest here .",
    "but such snrs must have significantly different distribution functions than standard sedov models , so that they must produce significantly different x - ray spectra . a considerable caution",
    "is then required when modeling and interpreting x - ray observations of snrs .",
    "the distribution functions presented by us are valid only for sedov models , without any shock modification by cosmic rays .",
    "it would be worthwhile to carry out an extensive investigation of the distribution functions expected in various cosmic - ray dominated snr models , but this task clearly demands a separate effort .",
    "note that , unlike for sedov models , x - ray spectra produced by our plane - parallel shocks may be used even for cosmic - ray modified shocks .",
    "the only difference is in interpretation of the shock temperature @xmath34 , whose relationship with the shock velocity @xmath0 is now provided not by the standard rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions , but by jump conditions appropriate for a collisionless shock with a particular cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency .",
    "another issue connected with the cosmic ray acceleration in snrs is the question of the electron velocity distribution . in our x - ray emission modeling",
    "we assumed that thermal electrons can be well described by a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "this is most likely a good assumption for the bulk of electrons , usually referred to as thermal electrons , but the presence of radio synchrotron emission in snrs demonstrates that there is a high energy tail to this distribution .",
    "the most energetic ( @xmath121 10  100 tev ) electrons produce nonthermal synchrotron x - ray emission , as has been recently inferred for sn 1006 @xcite , cas a @xcite , g347.5 - 0.2 @xcite , and rcw 86 ( borkowski et al . 2000 ) , and modeled in detail by reynolds ( 1998 ) . in addition , less energetic electrons in the high energy tail , with energies of several tens of kev , can also produce lines and continua , through the same atomic processes as thermal electrons .",
    "( the continuum produced by such electrons is usually referred as nonthermal bremsstrahlung . )",
    "if these nonthermal processes are important in an snr , then interpretation of its x - ray spectrum must rely on a combination of thermal and nonthermal models .",
    "a good example is snr rcw 86 where a complex mixture of nonthermal synchrotron and multitemperature thermal emission is present ( borkowski et al .",
    "it is not clear at this time how important nonthermal bremsstrahlung is in snrs , because of the predominance of nonthermal synchrotron x - ray emission .",
    "but if nonthermal bremsstrahlung were important , energetic electrons producing it would also excite line emission , possibly leading to changes in line strength ratios and intensities",
    ". the possible presence of such electrons in snrs is clearly an important issue for interpretation of snr x - ray spectra .",
    "one might hope that with the high quality x - ray observations of snrs becoming available , we will be able to determine the distribution functions discussed in this work , and unambiguously separate thermal and nonthermal emission in snrs .",
