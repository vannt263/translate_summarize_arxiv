    "at optical and near infrared wavelengths , interstellar dust depresses the observed flux of galaxy disks by both scattering and absorption .",
    "several authors have proposed that , even in the face  on perspective , normal , non  starburst disks are optically thick at optical wavelengths , while others have argued for substantial transparency ( see the volume edited by davies & burstein 1995 and the review by calzetti 2001 for details ) . using a sample of spiral galaxies within @xmath6 , we statistically derived photometric solutions for the degree of internal extinction at i  band as a function of disk inclination ( giovanelli 1994 ) , finding a difference of more than a magnitude of flux between face  on and edge  on systems . at the same time , we found evidence for transparency of the outer parts of disks , at radii @xmath7 disk scale lengths from the center .",
    "we later reported that the amount of internal extinction is luminosity dependent : more luminous disks being more opaque than less luminous ones ( giovanelli  1995 ) .",
    "these results have been confirmed by more recent analyses ( e.g. tully  1998 ; wang & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "purely photometric techniques are subject to a peculiar set of selection effects , that can severely affect quantitative conclusions on internal extinction , as witnessed by the liveliness of the debate over the last decade . in 1981 , goad & roberts noted a kinematic effect which can provide an independent test for disk extinction .",
    "let @xmath8 be the rotation curve of a disk ( @xmath9 being the radial coordinate along the disk s projected major axis ) , assumed to have axial symmetry .",
    "let @xmath10 be a set of cartesian coordinates _ in the plane of the disk_. if the disk is thin and it is observed at inclination @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for edge  on ) , the component of velocity along the line of sight which intercepts the disk at @xmath10 is v_= v(r ) x i + v_turb , where @xmath13 accounts for turbulence and @xmath14 is oriented along the disk s apparent major axis . an observed rotation curve , as derived for example from a long  slit  spectrum positioned along @xmath14 , is smeared by seeing , instrumental resolution , averaging across the slit width , the finite thickness of the disk and extinction occurring within the disk itself . as realistically thick disks approach the edge  on perspective , lines  of  sight along the major axis sample regions of increasingly broad range in @xmath15 , yielding a velocity distribution with a peak velocity contributed by parcels of gas at @xmath16 and a low velocity wing contributed by parcels at @xmath17 .",
    "if extinction is important , only foreground parts of the disk contribute to the emission and the factor @xmath18 depresses the velocity distribution observed at @xmath19 . goad & roberts noted how this tapering effect may , in opaque edge  on disks , produce observed rotation curves resembling solid  body behavior , independently of the true shape of @xmath8 . bosma ( 1992 ) applied this technique to two edge  on systems , ngc 100 and ngc 891 , by comparing hi synthesis and  observations .",
    "the evidence led them to conclude that the disk of ngc 100 is transparent , while in the case of ngc 891 they could not exclude the possibility of extinction in the inner parts of the disk .",
    "prada ( 1994 ) compared long  slit spectra of ngc 2146 in the optical and near ir and reported evidence for extinction in the inner parts of the galaxy .    here , we apply the goad & roberts test in a statistically convincing manner to a sample of more than 2000 / [ ] rotation curves .",
    "our results clearly indicate substantial opacity in the inner disks of spiral disks .",
    "they also show the effect to be luminosity dependent , in a manner very much in agreement with our previous photometric determination . in section 2",
    "we present our data sample and describe our rotation curve fits .",
    "results on extinction are discussed in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss an interesting serendipitous finding : the apparent constancy of the mean value of the kinematic scale length of / [ ] rotation curves , across populations of different luminosity class . throughout this paper",
    ", distances and luminosities are obtained from redshifts in the cosmic microwave background reference frame and scaled according to a hubble parameter @xmath20   mpc@xmath21 .",
    "as an effort to map the peculiar velocity field of the local universe , we have assembled a sample of several thousand observations of i  band photometry and rotational width data of spiral galaxies .",
    "our observations , including those listed in dale & giovanelli ( 2000 and refs . therein ) as well as several hundred obtained at the hale 5 m telescope after that report and to be presented elsewhere , have been complemented by the samples observed in the southern hemisphere by mathewson and co  workers ( mathewson  1992 ; mathewson & ford 1996 ) .",
    "the kinematic information for a substantial subset of these data is in the form of rotation curves in electronic form , derived from long  slit / [ ] spectra .",
    "rotation curves can be fitted by a variety of parametric models , some of which are motivated by the physical expectation of contributions by a baryonic component with a mass distribution mimicking that of the light plus a dark matter spheroidal halo .",
    "other models rely purely on the versatility of a mathematical form in fitting effectively the observed rotation curves with a minimum of free parameters . here",
    "we report on fits to 2246 rotation curves with a parametric model of the form v_pe(r ) = v_(1-e^-r / r_pe)(1+r / r_pe ) where @xmath22 regulates the overall amplitude of the rotation curve , @xmath23 yields a scale length for the inner steep rise and @xmath24 sets the slope of the slowly changing outer part .",
    "this simple model , which we refer to as _",
    "polyex _ , has been found to be very `` plastic '' .",
    "it fits effectively both the steeply rising inner parts of rotation curves , as well as varying outer slopes , and it can be used to advantage in estimating velocity widths at specific radial distances from the galactic center as required by applications of the luminosity  linewidth relation . in particular , it provides a very useful estimate of the inner slope of the rotation curve as given by @xmath23 . of the 2246 rotation curves fitted by the model shown in equation ( 2 )",

    "the effect is not evident in the least luminous systems ( those with @xmath69 fainter than -19.5 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the expectations based on the photometric determination of giovanelli ( 1995 ) .",
    "no axial ratio dependence is observed for @xmath24 , the outer slope of the rotation curves .",
    "we have carried out preliminary modelling of the observations shown in figure 1 by simulating the dust and  distributions as exponential disks both in @xmath9 and @xmath70 . assuming the same distribution for dust and  tracers , with a ratio between scale height and scale length of 0.06 ( as found by xilouris 1997 ; 1998 ) , we obtain approximate match between models and figure 1 for values of the the face  on ( @xmath71 ) , central ( @xmath72 ) optical depth of the model at the wavelegth of  ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 , of about 4 .",
    "these modelling results are preliminary and depend very sensitively on the assumed thickness of disks and on the relative scales of dust and  sources .",
    "we will report more extensively on the results of this effort at a later stage .",
    "figure 1 shows that , for low axial ratios ( where the effect of internal extinction is negligible ) , the average value of the kinematical scale length @xmath23 is approximately the same for disks of all luminosities .",
    "is this result to be expected ?",
    "first , we exclude that the angular resolution of spectroscopic observations has a significant impact on the reported findings . not using galaxies for which @xmath23 projects to an angular size @xmath75 rules out bias due to extreme cases of poor angular resolution .",
    "since we use rotation curves from different sources , which have been produced with different angular sampling intervals , we have also verified that there is no systematic difference in the fitted values of @xmath76 among different data sources , taking advantage of significant sample overlaps .",
    "we have done so for several dozen galaxies appearing in at least two samples among those : of our own , of mathewson et al .",
    ", of courteau ( 1997 ) and of rubin et al .",
    "( 1999 and refs . therein ) .",
    "second , we explore the effect of sample selection criteria .",
    "the values of @xmath77 displayed in figure 1 are affected by malmquist bias , which does not impact on the trends produced by extinction but alters the relative values of @xmath77 among different luminosity classes : since more luminous populations have larger average distance , for them the angular size limit of 3 `` produces an @xmath77 biased high . in order to remove this bias , we draw a subsample which is volume limited , by including in it only systems with @xmath78 , @xmath79 kpc and within the distance range @xmath80 to @xmath81 mpc . at @xmath81 mpc , an angular size limit of 3 '' translates into a linear size limit of about 1 kpc ; the reason for a lower limit in distance is to reduce the uncertainty introduced by peculiar velocities .",
    "we further restrict the subsample to low inclination disks ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 respectively for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 )  in order to get around the extinction effect discussed in the previous section  and compute the mean values of @xmath23 and @xmath76 , now identified by a subscript `` 1 '' ; those values are listed in columns 5 and 6 of table 1 , for each luminosity class .",
    "the exclusion of galaxies with @xmath88 kpc biases high the values of @xmath89 ; it does so however equally for all luminosity classes , through which @xmath89 remains approximately constant .",
    "the mean values @xmath90 , which increase with decreasing luminosity , illustrate the fact that less luminous populations are on the average more nearby .",
    "note that the values of @xmath90 are fairly large in comparison with the typical seeing , excluding the likelihood of an angular resolution bias .",
    "next , we inquire on the implications of a constant @xmath23 on the total mass distribution",
    ". assume the total mass of the galaxy @xmath91 is that comprised within a limiting radius @xmath92 , defined as that within which the halo mean density is 200 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "then , m(r_pe)=m_200|(r_pe)|_200 ( r_per_200)^3 where @xmath93 is the mass within @xmath23 , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are respectively the mean density within @xmath23 and within @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath96 , we can also express the ratio between the rotational velocity at @xmath23 and the asymptotic value @xmath97 as ^2 = |(r_pe)|_200 ( r_per_200)^2 for a flat rotation curve , the definition of @xmath23 yields @xmath98 ^ 2\\simeq 0.4 $ ] ; then m(r_pe ) 0.4 m_200r_per_200 it can be shown that @xmath99 ; thus , for a constant value of @xmath23 : m(r_pe ) m_200 ^ 2/3 since @xmath65 does not generally coincide with @xmath97 , the effect of the luminosity dependence of @xmath24 needs to be taken into account : it can be parametrized by writing @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is small and positive . in general , equation ( 6",
    ") can then be rewritten as m(r_pe ) m_200 ^ 2/3 +    we now inquire on the dependence of the halo mass within @xmath23 on the total mass .",
    "we assume a halo density form as proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) : _",
    "h(r ) = _ crit_(r",
    "/ r_s)(1+r / r_s)^2 where @xmath102 is the cosmological critical density , and the scaling parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be expressed in terms of @xmath92 and a concentration index @xmath105 , with @xmath106^{-1}$ ] . for small values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the halo mass within radius @xmath9 is m_h(r ) = 400c^2 _ crit r_200(1+c)-c/(1+c )  r^2 where @xmath107 . for a constant @xmath23 , m_h(r_pe )",
    "m_200 ^ 1/3 numerical simulations indicate that @xmath108 is mildly dependent on halo mass , _ decreasing _ approximately as @xmath109 with @xmath110 ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "a comparison of equations ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) thus indicates that the mass in the halo can not account for the inner shape of the rotation curve , unless the concentration index _ increases _ with halo mass , opposite to what numerical simulations suggest .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the contribution of disk and bulge to @xmath93 increases with galaxy luminosity ( and mass ) , a well  exercised idea in the current literature ( e.g. burstein & rubin 1985 ; broeils 1992 ; moriondo , giovanardi & hunt 1998 ; sellwood 1999 and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath111 , @xmath112 and neglect the dependence of @xmath108 on @xmath91 , 1+f_d m_200 ^ 1/3 , suggesting that as the galaxy mass increases , the fraction of baryonic material in the inner few kpc grows rather quickly . for these systems , the baryonic mass fraction may saturate at its cosmological level ( i.e. these systems retain all their baryons ) and their inner rotation curves may be completely determined by it .",
    "the spirals in our sample have small bulges ( they are mostly of type sbc and sc ) . within that context ,",
    "note that in an exponential disk  dominated rotation curve a rotational velocity @xmath64 of the maximum is obtained at a radial distance of about 0.6 disk scale lengths . for galaxies in our high luminosity bin , the mean ratio between @xmath23 and the scale length of the disk light is @xmath29 , as shown in table 1 , while it rises to twice that value for the less luminous galaxies in our sample .",
    "we conclude that the simplest and most likely explanation of the near constancy of @xmath77 among luminosity classes is that the baryonic mass fraction within the inner few kpc of spirals increases with total luminosity , and that within that region the most luminous spirals are entirely dominated by baryonic matter .",
    "we integrate photometric profiles to @xmath113 in order to obtain i band luminosities within that radius , assuming a solar absolute magnitude of + 3.94 ( livingston 2000 ) .",
    "estimating mass from @xmath114 , for galaxies brighter than @xmath115 we obtain a mean baryonic mass  to  light ratio @xmath116  @xmath3 within @xmath23 .",
    "individual colors for galaxies in our sample are not available ; however , if we assume that spiral galaxies radiate approximately like blackbodies with @xmath117 , then a mean bolometric @xmath118  @xmath119 can be estimated . the coarse analysis presented here",
    "does not take into consideration the dynamical effect of a central bulge with a low spin parameter and we have not attempted to separate disk and bulge contributions to the light . it is interesting to compare our result with that of bottema ( 1999 ) for the sb galaxy ngc 7331 : from measurements of stellar velocity dispersions he obtains @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we have shown that the / [ ] rotation curves of spiral galaxies exhibit a dependence of the inner slope of their rotation curves on the galaxy axial ratio .",
    "we have interpreted this result as induced by extinction occurring within disks .",
    "the effect is luminosity dependent , being stronger for the most luminous systems as previously indicated by giovanelli ( 1995 ) on photometric grounds .",
    "serendipitously , it was also found that rotation curves of galaxies of different luminosity classes exhibit approximately the same average exponential scale length in the inner regions , of about @xmath122 kpc ( the result has potential in the determination of redshift  independent distances : we will report elsewhere on this application ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the idea that in the inner parts of spiral galaxies the baryonic component contributes a rapidly increasing fraction of the mass , with increasing total luminosity of systems .",
    "in fact , the most luminous galaxies in our sample appear to be completely baryon  dominated within the inner few kpc .",
    "we use this inference and the combination of spectroscopic and photometric data to estimate a mean baryonic mass  to  light ratio for that region @xmath123 @xmath3 in the i band ."
