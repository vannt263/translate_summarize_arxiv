    "cold neutral gas traces gravitational potential wells , and in the nearby universe , astronomers use the 21 cm line as a dynamical indicator to obtain the total amount and distribution of gravitating mass associated with galaxies . at high redshift , the neutral gas mass constitutes a larger fraction of the observable luminous mass in baryons ( lanzetta et al 1995 , storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) , making the hi itself a more important gravitating element , and the stars less so .",
    "this increases the importance of selecting galaxies at high redshift based purely on their neutral gas content , since these objects are likely to point to deep gravitational potentials where the progenitors of the galaxies of the present epoch are forming .    despite presenting different opinions on the nature of the high hi column density qso absorption line systems with @xmath5 atoms",
    "@xmath6 known as ",
    "damped lyman-@xmath4 ( dla ) , both prochaska & wolfe ( 1998 ) and haehnelt et al ( 1998 ) do agree that the dla systems are `` the progenitors of the present day normal galaxies . ''",
    "since the 21 cm line requires column densities of hi in excess of @xmath7 atoms  @xmath6 to create strong absorption lines , the redshifted 21 cm absorbers are identified with the dla class of quasar absorption - line and thus with evolving galactic potentials .    due to its early identification by brown & mitchell ( 1983 ) ,",
    "the 21 cm line observed at @xmath8 against the extended radio quasar 3c196 ( @xmath9 ) has received extensive follow - up with a variety of techniques , including ground - base and hst imaging and spectroscopy",
    ". the 3c196 line of sight has received additional attention , due to its association with dla s and its low redshift , which makes detection of a possible optical counterpart to the absorber and the study of the environment of the absorber easier than for the higher @xmath10 dla s that are selected most readily in ground - based spectroscopy of the lyman-@xmath4 line at @xmath11 .",
    "the absorption redshift was subsequently selected in a survey for mgii absorption against steep spectrum quasars by aldcroft et al ( 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "the optical identification of two candidates ( 3c196-g1 and 3c196-g2 ) for an intervening absorbing galaxy were made by boiss & boulade ( 1990 ) .",
    "subsequent hst imaging has shown that g1 is a large barred spiral located about 1.5@xmath12 south - east of the quasar ( cohen et al 1996 , le brun et al , 1997 , ridgway & stockton 1997 ) .",
    "the outlying spiral arms of g1 appeared to extend across the two extended radio lobes of the background radio quasar , leading to the puzzle posed by cohen et al over why only one relatively narrow absorption profile was observed in the 21 cm line spectrum , when a velocity spread of several hundred km  s@xmath13 would be expected for absorption over the full extent of the g1 galaxy .",
    "g2 is due north of the quasar nucleus .",
    "a second puzzle arose from the spectroscopic studies .",
    "ground based spectroscopy ( foltz et al 1988 ) showed that the metal - line absorption was spread over a wider range than the 21 cm absorption , but that the redshift of the center of the metal line profiles fell at @xmath14  km  s@xmath13 greater than the 21 cm line redshift ( cohen et al 1996 ) .",
    "a third important constraint comes from the spectral - line vlbi observation of brown et al ( 1988 ) , which detected no absorption against a marginally resolved hot spot in the ne radio continuum lobe and implied that the absorption must take place in a spatially extended absorber against the more diffuse and extended radio continuum structure , thus placing a lower limit on the size of the absorber of @xmath15kpc ( foltz et al 1998 ) .    in summary ,",
    "prior to the observations we report here , there was a candidate galaxy for which no redshift had been measured to confirm its role as the site of the 21 cm absorption , and there were several puzzles about how the galaxy s kinematics might explain both the 21 cm absorption profile and the line widths and redshift of the metal lines .",
    "these new 21 cm line observations resolve these ambiguities , establishing the luminous barred spiral 3c196-g1 as the absorber , as well as providing a measure of its dynamical mass .",
    "the system remains an interesting candidate for high - spatial resolution radio aperture synthesis , and provides a view for how these techniques could be applied to the highest redshift dla absorbers in order to determine their nature at much higher redshifts .",
    "new westerbork synthesis radio telescope observations were conducted in the compound interferometer ( ci ) as well as in regular synthesis mode . in the ci - mode we crosscorrelate the signal from two tied - arrays each representing the summed signal of 6 telescopes ( chengalur et al 1996 ) . in doing",
    "so we can use the full correlator capacity to record both a wide band ( 5 mhz ) and attain high spectral resolution ( 15 khz ) .",
    "a 12 hour observation on december 21 1996 was distributed equally between 3c196 and the bandpass calibrator source 3c147 with a dutycycle of 2 hours . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .  [ ci.fig ] .",
    "the 2% deep absorption line discovered by brown & mitchell is seen around channel 500 .",
    "however , we also detected a second absorption line .",
    "this line , visible near channel 650 is both wider ( about 100 km / sec ) and shallower ( 0.3% peak absorption ) [ the sharp feature near channel 200 is due to interference ] .",
    "no baseline was removed from the spectrum .",
    "a second observation was done on january 6 1997 in regular synthesis mode using the line backend ( bos et al 1981 ) with 2.5 mhz and 64 channels with the central frequency halfway between the two absorption features .",
    "a total of 10 hours of integration was spent on 3c196 with the available 13 telescopes .",
    "the calibrator 3c147 was observed for a total of 3 hours before and midway during the 3c196 observation . following a selfcalibration on 3c147 we transferred the complex passbands , on a telescope by telescope basis , to the visibilities of 3c196 .",
    "the data were then fourier transformed to yield a cube of 56 images ( channels 3 - 58 ) .",
    "3c196 is unresolved by the wsrt synthesized beam at 988 mhz , which has half - power full - width of 20@xmath16 , and we therefore determined the peak amplitude of the source as a function of frequency .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in fig.2 .",
    "no baseline had to be removed .",
    "the quality of the spectrum is indeed excellent .",
    "both absorption features are seen with high s / n and there is no doubt about the reality of the shallower feature at 988.0 mhz .",
    "we note this because this feature was not seen in the spectrum reported by brown & mitchell . the superior baseline stability of interferometers compared to those obtained using a single dish is obvious .",
    "the passband is stable to better than one part in a thousand and is in fact limited by thermal noise in the 3c196 and 3c147 data .",
    "the redshift measured for the optical and uv lines ( foltz et al 1988 ) falls between the two 21 cm absorption features .    the wsrt synthesized beam at this frequency is @xmath17 , and this is much larger than the size of the radio source .",
    "however , the spectral dynamic range of the data , in amplitude as well as in phase , is so good ( @xmath184000:1 ) that we should be able to determine the centroid of the source as a function of frequency to 1 part in 8000 of the synthesized beamwidth .",
    "this is done with the newstar program nmodel that fits a model to the uv data .",
    "3 shows the derived source centroid position as a function of frequency .",
    "note that the angular scale is measured in milli - arcseconds . in three groups of continuum channels outside the absorption lines ,",
    "the centroid position is found to be independent of frequency to within a few mas , as could be expected on the basis of the s / n ratio .",
    "this centroid lies about halfway between the two radiolobes .",
    "however , in the absorption channels we see a systematic shift of the source centroid . in the channels corresponding to the deepest absorption feature the source centroid shifts by about 0.040@xmath12 to the north - east with the largest shift occurring in the channels where the absorption line reaches its lowest value of about -1.6% . correcting the observed shift by the channel dependent depth of the absorption line",
    ", we can deduce the true location of the deep absorption feature to lie about 2.5@xmath19 in the opposite direction , i.e. toward the south - west .",
    "this is precisely the location of the brightest hotspot relative to the continuum centroid as deduced from published 408 and 1666 mhz merlin images ( lonsdale & morison 1983 ) .",
    "the true depth of the absorption line against that hotspot must be about 4% since this hotspot is responsible for nearly 50% of the total flux density at 988 mhz .",
    "the shallow absorption feature , on the other hand , shows an average centroid shift of about 0.015@xmath12 in the opposite direction implying that the absorbed part of the radio source lies about 3.7@xmath20 east - north - east of the continuum centroid .",
    "this corresponds to the location of the eastern lobe of 3c196 .",
    "the larger velocity width of this line suggests that gas with a range of velocities is present in front of this extended lobe .",
    "since the total flux in this lobe ( at 988 mhz ) is about 15 - 20% of the total continuum flux the optical depth must be at least 2% and probably several times larger since gas at a single velocity will be covered by only part of the lobe .",
    "the location of the absorbing gas leaves no doubt that the barred spiral seen in the hst image is responsible for the 21 cm absorption .",
    "a simple kinematic model consisting of a differentially rotating flat disk of neutral gas can explain the observational results of figs .  1 - 3 .",

    "we assume a uniform gas distribution throughout the disk ; the hst image shows a barred galaxy with prominent arms , which is unlikely to provide uniform optical depth . the data at hand does not justify a more detailed model .",

    "model iv shows an example of a model that begins to fail due to the appearance of a distinct narrow feature in the low - redshift component due to the placement of the major axis ( a region of the velocity field with low velocity gradient ) over the diffuse eastern continuum lobe , leading to a feature that is akin to the horn of a inclined spiral galaxy emission profile .",
    "[ spectra.fig ] further shows that the spectral shape imposes a limit on the diameter and inclination of the model disk , since any model that causes the disk to cover the bright northern hot spot would lead to the appearance of a third absorption feature .",

    "in this diagram , the error bars actually specify the full - width at half - maximum of the resonance line absorption measured by foltz , chaffee & wolfe ( 1988 ) ; in order to account for the wide velocity spread of the metal lines , there needs to be a `` turbulent medium , '' probably composed of multiple , low column density clouds spread over more than 100 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "such a medium may mask the presence of a cold , higher column density absorber at the velocity where the line of sight penetrates the extrapolation of the intervening galaxy disk .",

    "[ centroids.fig ] indicates the location of the source centroid as a function of frequency through the 21 cm line profile for comparison with fig .",
    "all models that produce reasonable `` integrated absorption '' profiles also lead to acceptable trajectories for the source centroid .",

    "the new 21 cm line spectra showing the double - feature profile spread over @xmath18300 km  s@xmath13 places the new constraints on the physical extent of the absorbing layer and the kinematics of the gas , and , along with the self - consistent centroid shift , these facts confirm that 3c196-g1 is indeed the cause of the 21cm / damped lyman-@xmath4 absorption .",
    "it is also of great interest to understand the nature of the metal - line absorption along the line of sight to the optical nucleus of 3c196 , and a satisfactory interpretation of the morphology in the hst image would be a useful outcome .",
    "is it possible to deduce a viewing angle that allows the galaxy to be deprojected to resemble a normal barred spiral with gently winding arms , or must the galaxy s morphology be a result of tidal interaction , possibly caused by 3c196-g2 ?",
    "we first consider the advantages and disadvantages of each of the representative kinematic models in turn :    _ model i _ does well at reproducing the 21 cm absorption profiles .",
    "this model has a high rotation speed @xmath49 km  s@xmath13 , and it is oriented ( see fig .",
    "[ velfields.fig ] ) with the kinematic major axis lying closer to the line of sight to the quasar than to the hot spot in the sw radio continuum lobe .",
    "this leads to the prediction that the interception velocity towards the qso nucleus will be blue shifted with respect to the deep 21 cm feature , in contradiction to what is observed .",
    "_ model ii _ adopts the orientation and inclination deduced for the central stellar body of g1 by cohen et al ( 1996 ) . in our kinematic model , the radial extent of the disk is increased to cover the background radio continuum lobes with @xmath25 and @xmath24 fixed at the values of cohen et al . for this model",
    ", the interception velocity on the line of sight to the qso nucleus falls outside the 21 cm profile , but not as greatly blue shifted as for model i. the predicted optical / uv velocity falls at the ends of the error bars indicating the measured uv line velocity spread , implying that high spectral resolution optical observations could provide a significant test of the viability of this model .",
    "_ model iii _ does nicely on most of the observational tests .",
    "it produces the correct velocity spread , and the galaxy s optical morphology shows winding spiral arms .",
    "since the line of sight to the quasar optical nucleus is closer to the minor axis of the orbits than is the hot spot in the sw continuum lobe , the predicted velocity component for the interception of the disk lies on the low redshift side of the deep 21 cm feature , instead of the high redshift side .",
    "this may not be a serious problem since the disk interception velocity does lie just at one end of the fwhm velocity spread of the metal lines , and , in these sorts of mgii / feii lines , the turbulent width is actually built up from many narrower components that represent individual absorbing clouds .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that point - like interceptions of differentially rotating disks that are either thick or located within a corotating halo of cloudlets will produce asymmetric metal - line profiles  with the 21 cm line or thickest , cold component at one side of the profile ( briggs et al 1985 , lanzetta & bowen 1992 , prochaska & wolfe 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "_ model iv _ is minor re - orientation of model iii with the goal of increasing the degree of winding of the arms in the deprojected image and decreasing the radial extent of the gas ( see fig .  [ deprojoverlays.fig ] ) .",
    "this relatively small change from model iii produces distortion in the low redshift 21 cm feature due to rotation of the major axis of the rotating disk onto the more intense part of the diffuse eastern lobe .",
    "the narrow feature that develops is the beginning of a `` horn '' of a conventional double - horned emission profile observed in @xmath50 disk galaxies .",
    "this model iv has a near perfect agreement between the observed metal - line redshift and the disk interception velocity .",
    "we have adopted models i and iii for working hypotheses in the subsequent discussions , since they represent the extremes in rotation velocity while still yielding reasonable velocity profiles . however , there clearly are variations of these models , such as non - planar and non - circular motions ( warps , tidally induced arms , etc ) and non - uniform gas coverage that would add many additional degrees of freedom to any model that strives to fit the absorption profiles exactly .",
    "the strongest constraints are that the rotation velocity must be at least @xmath51  km  s@xmath13 and that the velocity field is centered on the galaxy g1 .",
    "larger rotation speeds can always be compensated to some extent by lowering the inclination @xmath24 and adjusting the optical depth coverage to reproduce the observed profiles .",
    "however , the inclination can not be lowered much from the tabulated values before the bright continuum hot - spot in the ne lobe becomes covered , which would add an additional strong absorption component to the model profiles .",
    "the uniform disk models i and iii would reach the ne hot spot when @xmath24 is reduced from 70@xmath52 to 65@xmath52 and 50@xmath52 , respectively . for these models to still provide the observed velocity spread as the inclination is lowered , the disk rotation speed would have to increase by 4% for model i and 22% for model iii .",
    "the sharp edge at @xmath23 assumed in the simple uniform disk model is unlikely to be realistic , and these data are unable to address the question of whether there is a hole in the neutral gas at the center of the galaxy where the bright stellar body is located .",
    "one of the most viable alternatives to the simple uniform disk model involves a tidal interaction , which would give rise to long gas - rich arms that could extend nearly radially from the host galaxy and could be highly non - planar .",
    "one possibility is that the galaxy g2 ( located slightly to the north and east of the quasar nucleus ) is interacting with g1 , although other investigations favor the association of g2 with the quasar at @xmath48 ( ridgway & stockton 1997 ) .",
    "all of the disk models in table 1 are consistent with brown etal ( 1988 ) 988 mhz spectral - line vlbi result , which found no trace of 21 cm absorption against the northeastern radio - lobe hot spot , since all the models in table  [ model.tab ] cut off at radii that do not reach the hot spot .",
    "a tidal arm model would similarly place no absorbing gas over the hot spot .",
    "however , if the second galaxy g2 is actually a perturber of g1 , it may be useful to observe a still broader spectrum in the 21 cm line to test whether g2 has a low - level gaseous envelope that extends to the hot spot .",
    "the line of sight column density of hi is @xmath53@xmath6 for model ii and @xmath54@xmath6 for models i , iii and iv .",
    "spin temperatures in redshifted absorption systems are generally higher than the @xmath55  k that we have adopted here ( wolfe & davis 1979 , wolfe et al 1985 , taramopoulos et al 1995 , carilli et al 1996 , briggs et al 1997 , chengalur & kanekar 2000 ) , implying that the @xmath56 may be considerably higher and that this system definitely lies in the dla class .",
    "cohen et al ( 1996 ) measured the lyman-@xmath4 line in an hst spectrum , but they discovered that this region of the spectrum was confused by the higher order lyman - series lines of a higher redshift lyman - limit system at @xmath57 and metal absorption lines . their analysis is compatible with a range for @xmath58 of @xmath59 to @xmath60@xmath6 , with a best - fit favoring the highest value .",
    "thus , the preferred value of cohen et al is in reasonable agreement with the range of column densities required in our models .",

    "<S> westerbork radio synthesis telescope observations of the redshifted 21 cm line absorber against the @xmath0 double lobed quasar 3c196 show that the intervening absorber is an @xmath1 spiral galaxy ( 3c196-g1 ) and that the absorbing layer of cold gas extends to radii of at least 30  @xmath2kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the new data solve several long standing puzzles about this system by ( 1 ) discovering a second 21 cm absorption feature , corresponding to absorption against the ne lobe of the background radio source and ( 2 ) spatially `` resolving '' the two absorption features to isolate the absorption along the two lines of sight to the opposing radio lobes . </S>",
    "<S> these findings resolve the disagreement in redshift between the uv metal and 21 cm lines , and as well as demonstrating that the neutral layer does absorb both lobes of the background radio source . </S>",
    "<S> simple kinematic models with an inclined , rotating gas disk match the observed 21 cm profile and are also compatible with both the redshift and velocity spread of the absorption measured in uv resonance lines along a third , independent line of sight to the quasar nucleus and with the lack of 21 cm absorption in as earlier vlbi experiment that was sensitive to opacity against the hot spot in the northern lobe . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred rotation speed and luminosity for the galaxy are compatible with the @xmath3 tully - fisher relation .    </S>",
    "<S> this system illustrates well how 21 cm absorption against extended background radio sources is a powerful tool in determining the nature of the damped lyman-@xmath4 class of qso absorption line system . </S>"
