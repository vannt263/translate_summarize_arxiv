    "it is well known that not all discontinuous solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws are admissible .",
    "some of these can be excluded on physical grounds . for example , expansion shocks in gas dynamics must be discarded since they do not satisfy the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "others can be excluded for purely mathematical reasons such as the fact that they do not satisfy uniqueness and existence conditions or are structurally unstable with respect to small perturbations of the initial data .",
    "these mathematical conditions are usually called evolutionary conditions .",
    "for example , intermediate shocks in magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) satisfy the second law but are not evolutionary .",
    "this subject was extensively studied between the late 1940 s and early 1960 s ( e.g. courant & friedrichs 1948 , lax 1957 , akhiezer et al .",
    "1959 , germain 1960 , gelfand 1963 , polovin 1961 ) and a full account can be found in numerous textbooks ( e.g. jeffrey & taniuti 1964 , cabannes 1970 , somov 1994 ) . until recently there was general agreement that admissible shocks must both satisfy the evolutionary condition and possess a steady dissipative shock structure , although the relation between these conditions was not entirely clear . there",
    "the matter rested until time - dependent numerical solutions of the dissipative mhd equations showed that certain types of intermediate shocks can arise from smooth initial data ( wu 1987 ) . shortly thereafter , brio & wu ( 1988 ) found intermediate shocks in their numerical solution for a particular mhd riemann problem .",
    "more recently , intermediate shocks have been also been found in two - dimensional simulations ( de sterck et al .",
    "furthermore , chao et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have reported a detection of an interplanetary intermediate shock in the voyager 1 data .",
    "all this has caused some authors to reject the classical theory and to suggest that the evolutionary condition is not relevant to dissipative mhd ( wu 1987 , 1988a , b , 1990 ; kennel , blandford & wu 1990 ; hada 1994 , myong & roe 1997a , b ) and has led to a reexamination of the whole question of the existence , or otherwise , of non - classical shocks ( see glimm 1988 , freistuhler & liu 1993 , myong & roe 1997a and references therein ) .",
    "there are , however , others who argue that there is nothing wrong with the classical theory ( e.g. barmin , kulikovsky & pogorelov 1996 ; falle & komissarov 1997 ) .",
    "the matter clearly needs to be resolved , particularly since the existence , or otherwise of intermediate shocks is of crucial importance not only for fundamental mhd processes such as reconnection ( wu 1995 ) , but is also relevant to many other astrophysical applications .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to try and clear the matter up by showing that there is neither a real conflict between the classical shock theory and the results of numerical calculations nor any incompatibility between ideal and dissipative mhd . in order to make the discussion complete ,",
    "we have put together and extended a number of results from the literature that have tended be ignored or misunderstood .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  [ sgeneral ]",
    "we briefly review the classical shock theory and the evolutionary conditions . in  [ dis - str ]",
    "we study the relationship between these conditions and the uniqueness and existence of steady dissipative shock structures for systems with a concave entropy function . in  [ apple ] we apply these results to the full system of mhd equations and to the reduced system of planar mhd . in  [ numerics ] we present the results of numerical calculations which show that , for both these systems , the behaviour of the shocks is entirely consistent with the predictions of the classical shock theory . in  [ dissc ]",
    "we consider various aspects of the problem of intermediate shocks and discuss ways in which to avoid their appearance in mhd simulations with planar symmetry .",
    "in particular , we present the results of one dimensional simulations using a modified glimm scheme ( glimm 1965 ) in which these shocks do not appear .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of the classical theory of discontinuous solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to consider only the dimensional equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a vector of conserved variables and @xmath2 is a vector of the corresponding fluxes .",
    "as is well known , the system ( [ a1 ] ) is called hyperbolic if the jacobian matrix @xmath3 has @xmath4 real eigenvalues , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) corresponding to @xmath4 linearly independent right eigenvectors , @xmath7 and is called strictly hyperbolic if all the @xmath5 are different .",
    "the physical significance of the @xmath5 is that they are the speeds of small amplitude waves .",
    "waves are classified as linear or nonlinear according to the behaviour of @xmath8 if @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , then the k - wave is called linear , whereas if the dimension of the surface defined by @xmath9 is less then @xmath4 , then it is called nonlinear or genuinely nonlinear .    the states ,",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 on either side of a discontinuity travelling with speed @xmath13 must satisfy the shock equations @xmath14 the number @xmath15 of independent shock equations can be less then @xmath4 .",
    "for example , a contact discontinuity in gas dynamics has @xmath16 whereas @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 is the jacobian , we clearly have @xmath19 for some @xmath20 as @xmath21 , which means that one can associate each discontinuity that allows this limit with one of the waves of the system .",
    "a discontinuity is called linear if the corresponding characteristic speed does not change across it , otherwise it is called nonlinear .",
    "there mere fact that a discontinuity satisfies ( [ a4 ] ) it does not necessarily imply that it is either stable or that it can arise from continuous initial data",
    ".    for some hyperbolic systems equations ( [ a4 ] ) allow nonlinear shocks that propagate with a characteristic speed associated with a nonlinear wave , which means that they can be attached to such a wave to form compound waves .",
    "systems with such shock solutions are called non - convex .",
    "compound waves may arise from continuous initial data if the system allows single simple waves in which @xmath22 changes sign along the phase curve of a simple wave .",
    "this condition is therefore often used as an alternative definition of non - convexity .",
    "although these definitions are equivalent for a single conservation law , they are not necessarily so for systems .",
    "the evolutionary condition is directly related to the question of existence and uniqueness of discontinuous solutions .",
    "it is well known that for hyperbolic equations there is a general way of deciding this question , which is to use the compatibility conditions that must be satisfied along the characteristics ( friedrichs 1955 ) .",
    "if a characteristic with wave speed @xmath5 enters one side of a discontinuity , then the state on that side must satisfy the compatibility relation associated with that characteristic , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the left eigenvector of @xmath25 corresponding to that characteristic .",
    "these equations are independent provided the @xmath26 are linearly independent i.e. for all hyperbolic systems .",
    "if the wave speeds on either side of the discontinuity are such that @xmath27 compatibility relations have to be satisfied , then there are @xmath28 equations relating the @xmath29 unknowns associated with the discontinuity , @xmath30 , @xmath12 and the shock speed , @xmath13 .",
    "a discontinuous solution can therefore only exist and be unique if @xmath31 obviously , when @xmath32 , ( [ a5 ] ) reduces to @xmath33 it is clear from this that if a characteristic is parallel to the shock curve , then it is counted as incoming since the corresponding compatibility relation must be satisfied ( gelfand 1963 ) .",
    "if @xmath34 then the system is overdetermined and there is no solution except for certain special initial conditions .",
    "there will therefore always be arbitrarily small perturbations of this data that will destroy such a discontinuity by splitting it into a number of waves , just as an arbitrary initial dicontinuity splits in a riemann problem .",
    "if @xmath35 , then the solution exists , but is not unique and one might hope that this nonuniqueness can be removed by including dissipative terms . in the following we will call condition ( [ a5 ] ) the strong evolutionary condition and call the condition @xmath36 which allows nonunique solutions a relaxed evolutionary condition .    an equivalent way of obtaining ( [ a5 ] ) is by a linear structural stability analysis of shock solutions ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1959 , jeffrey & taniuti 1964 ) . a discontinuity that is exposed to a small amplitude incident wave will only survive if it can respond by changing its speed and emitting small amplitude waves .",
    "each such wave is described by one parameter and we also have the perturbation in the shock speed , which means that there are @xmath37 unknowns in this problem , where @xmath38 is the number of outgoing characteristics .",
    "since these are related to the amplitude of the incoming wave by the @xmath15 shock relations , the discontinuity can only have a unique response if @xmath39 it is worth pointing out that , contrary to what is claimed in myong & roe , 1997a , this analysis does not assume that the discontinuity is weak .",
    "this suggests that non - unique discontinuous solutions should spontaneously self - destruct by emitting waves even if they are not perturbed ( anderson 1963 ) .",
    "although the conditions ( [ a5 ] ) and ( [ a6 ] ) appear to be different , the fact that @xmath40 means that they are entirely equivalent ( gelfand 1963 ) .",
    "note that , if the system of shock and compatibility equations splits into independent subsets , then the discontinuity is only evolutionary if each of these subsets has the same number of equations as variables ( jeffrey & tanuiti 1964 ) .",
    "finally , as far as the evolutionary conditions are concerned it does not matter whether , or not , the system ( [ a1 ] ) is strictly hyperbolic and convex since these properties are not used in the derivation of ( [ a5],[a6 ] ) .",
    "however , it is only in the case of strictly hyperbolic systems that these conditions reduce to the lax conditions ( lax 1957 ) @xmath41 for a nonlinear discontinuity associated with the @xmath20th characteristic ( here we have assumed that @xmath42 ) .",
    "in order to assess recent claims that nonevolutionary shocks become admissible if dissipative terms are included , we need to look at the general relationship between the evolutionary conditions and the uniqueness and existence of steady dissipative shock structures .",
    "godunov ( 1961 ) has shown that it is much easier to explore this question if the equations can be transformed to a symmetric form .",
    "although this is not possible for arbitrary hyperbolic systems of conservation laws , it can certainly be done for gasdynamics , mhd , and the shallow water equations and probably for any system that can arise in nature .",
    "we start by summarizing some of the results described by friedrichs ( 1954 ) , friedrichs & lax ( 1971 ) and boillat ( 1974 , 1982 ) . as before",
    ", it is only necessary to consider the one dimensional case .    consider a dissipation - free system of conservation laws described by the equations ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "suppose now that there exists a quantity , @xmath43 , which is also conserved as long as the solution to this system is continuous .",
    "for example , @xmath44 is the entropy in gasdynamics or mhd , whereas it is the total energy for the shallow water equations .",
    "if such a quantity exists , then there must exist a flux function , @xmath45 , such that @xmath46    ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) can only be consistent if @xmath47 ( summation convention assumed ) , since then    @xmath48 for any @xmath49 solution satisfying ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "if we now use @xmath50 to define the legendre transformation @xmath51 then ( [ 10 ] ) allows us to write the fluxes as @xmath52 where @xmath53    in terms of the variables @xmath54 , ( [ a1 ] ) becomes a symmetric system    @xmath55    where the symmetric matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given by    @xmath58    note that @xmath50 is usually a strictly concave function , in which case ( [ 18 ] ) ensures that @xmath59 is positive definite and the transformation is non - singular . in ordinary gasdynamics or mhd ,",
    "@xmath50 is the entropy per unit volume and is therefore guaranteed to be concave by the second law of thermodynamics . for the shallow water equations @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy and dissipation ensures that this is also concave .",
    "if we now assume that the dissipative fluxes are proportional to the spatial gradients of the dependent variables , then the dissipative version of ( [ 17 ] ) is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a matrix of dissipation coefficients . multiplying this on the left by @xmath64 (",
    "the superfix t denotes the transpose ) and using ( [ 9][12 ] ) gives the evolution equation for @xmath50 @xmath65    integrating this over an arbitrary fixed interval @xmath66 $ ] and integrating the dissipative term by parts gives @xmath67^b_a =        \\int\\limits_a^b         \\frac{\\partial { \\bf u}^{\\prime t}}{\\partial x }                  { \\bf d }       \\frac{\\partial { \\bf u}^\\prime}{\\partial x }   d x .\\ ] ] since the term on the rhs of this equation represents a source term for @xmath50 and the second law of thermodynamic requires that this be positive if @xmath50 is the entropy per unit volume , the matrix @xmath68 must be positive definite for gasdynamics and mhd .",
    "the dissipative shallow water equations must also satisfy this condition if we set @xmath69 , where @xmath61 is the total energy .",
    "one can also show that all linear waves decay if @xmath63 is positive definite and @xmath50 is a strictly concave . the linear version of ( [ 20 ] )",
    "is simply @xmath70 where @xmath59 , @xmath71 , and @xmath68 are now constant matrices .",
    "multiplying this by @xmath64 and integrating over @xmath66 $ ] gives @xmath72^b_a =   -   2 \\int_a^b { { { \\partial { \\bf u}^{\\prime    t } }   \\over { \\partial x } }    { \\bf   d } { { \\partial { \\bf u}^\\prime } \\over { \\partial x } } d x},\\ ] ] after integrating the dissipative term by parts . since @xmath56 is positive definite if @xmath50 is strictly concave , the term on the rhs ensures that all linear waves decay if @xmath63 is positive definite ,      now consider a solution of the steady version of ( [ 20 ] ) @xmath73 with the boundary conditions @xmath74 if this represents a shock structure , then @xmath75 and @xmath76 must satisfy the shock relations in the shock frame @xmath77    integrating ( [ 27 ] ) and applying the boundary conditions ( [ 28 ] ) gives @xmath78 a steady shock structure therefore corresponds to a solution of ( [ 30 ] ) that connects the equilibrium points @xmath79 and @xmath76 .",
    "we now show that there is no guarantee that this solution is unique and structurally stable unless the corresponding discontinuous solution of the ideal system are satisfies the evolutionary conditions ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath80 be the unstable manifold of the point @xmath75 and @xmath81 the stable manifold of the point @xmath82 .",
    "then the trajectories in @xmath80 and @xmath81 are described by @xmath83 and @xmath84 parameters respectively .",
    "since any trajectory which lies in both has to satisfy @xmath85 matching conditions , this means that , in general , there will only be a unique trajectory connecting @xmath86 and @xmath12 if @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath88 , then the trajectory may not be unique , whereas if @xmath89 , then any trajectory that does exist can be destroyed by perturbations of @xmath75 , @xmath82 i.e. it is not structurally stable .    the following theorem relates @xmath90 and @xmath91 to the number of characteristics entering the shock :    if @xmath92 is an equilibrium point of the dissipative shock equations ( [ 30 ] ) at which none of the characteristic speeds vanish , then the equilibrium point is hyperbolic and the dimension of its stable ( unstable ) manifold is given by the number of positive ( negative ) characteristic speeds in the state @xmath92 .",
    "suppose that @xmath93 ( the proof for @xmath76 is identical ) . then linearizing ( [ 30 ] ) in the neighbourhood of @xmath75 gives @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "if this equilibrium point is hyperbolic , then the dimension of its stable ( unstable ) manifold are given by the numbers of eigenvalues , @xmath98 , satisfying @xmath99 with positive ( negative ) real parts .",
    "on the other hand , the characteristic speeds for the system ( [ 17 ] ) , @xmath5 , in the state @xmath75 are given by @xmath100 a standard result ( e.g. gantmacher 1959 ) tells us that , since @xmath101 , @xmath102 are symmetric and @xmath103 is positive definite , @xmath104 has the same number of positive , negative and zero eigenvalues as the set @xmath5 .",
    "if , like godunov ( 1961 ) , we assume that @xmath105 is symmetric as well as positive definite , then the theorem would follow immediately from ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) .",
    "however , the following lemma shows that this is an unnecessary restriction .",
    "let @xmath57 be a non - singular symmetric matrix , @xmath63 a positive definite matrix and @xmath98 the solutions of @xmath106 then the number of @xmath98 with positive ( negative ) real part is the same as the number of positive ( negative ) eigenvalues of @xmath71 .",
    "[ lem1 ]    define @xmath107 where @xmath108 $ ] and @xmath109 it easy to see that @xmath110 is also positive definite .",
    "now consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath111 the conclusion of the lemma is certainly true for @xmath112 , since then @xmath110 is symmetric . if we can show that the @xmath113 are continuous functions of @xmath114 and that @xmath115 for @xmath116 $ ] , then it will also be true for @xmath117 .",
    "the @xmath113 are the roots of a polynomial of degree @xmath4 whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath114",
    ". a root can therefore only change discontinuously by going to infinity , which can only occur if the coefficient , @xmath118 , of the highest power of @xmath119 vanishes .",
    "however , this can not happen since @xmath120 is positive definite for @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath113 must therefore be continuous functions of @xmath114 for @xmath108 $ ] .    in order to prove that the @xmath98 can not cross the imaginary axis ,",
    "suppose that for some @xmath20 , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is real . if @xmath123 is the corresponding eigenvector , we have @xmath124 multiplying the first of these by @xmath125 .",
    "the second by @xmath126 and substracting gives @xmath127 since @xmath110 is positive definite this requires @xmath128 and hence @xmath129 , which can not be true if the eigenvalues of @xmath130 are non - zero .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) , ( [ 33 ] ) and lemma ( [ lem1 ] ) show that the theorem is true even if @xmath63 is not symmetric .",
    "this is a somewhat more direct proof of a result which has also been obtained by kulikovsky & lyubimov ( 1965 ) . in their analysis of viscous shock structures ,",
    "myong & roe ( 1997a ) assumed that theorem 3.1 holds for mhd , but did not give a proof .",
    "this analysis tells us that if the shock relations ( [ 29 ] ) have a solution such that none of the characteristic speeds given by ( [ 33 ] ) vanish in both the left and the right state and @xmath27 is the number of characteristics entering the shock , then    1 .",
    "for @xmath131 the shock can have a unique structurally stable dissipative structure ; 2 .",
    "for @xmath132 the dissipative structure is not guaranteed to be unique .",
    "3 .   for @xmath133 there might be a unique dissipative structure but it can not be structurally stable .",
    "these conditions are not only compatible with the evolutionary conditions , they are complementary to them",
    ". shocks for which @xmath134 have a dissipative shock structure and could therefore be regarded as admissible on these grounds .",
    "however , the left and right states of such shocks must be carefully tuned since they can not adjust themselves to an arbitrary small perturbation of their left and right states .",
    "shocks that satisfy the relaxed evolutionary condition , @xmath135 , are apparently permitted by the ideal equations , but can not establish a dissipative structure and must spontaneously self - destruct .",
    "it is therefore clear that the only physically admissible shocks are those those that satisfy the strong evolutionary conditions ( [ a5 ] ) or ( [ a5a ] ) .",
    "theorem 3.1 gives us no information in those cases for which the shock speed coincides with at least one of the characteristic speeds .",
    "the corresponding critical point is then no longer hyperbolic and its type depends on the details of the particular system .",
    "as we shall see , the mathematical properties of the full system of mhd and the reduced planar system of mhd are somewhat different and this has to be clearly understood when the evolutionary conditions are applied .",
    "we therefore discuss these systems separately .",
    "it is well known that the one dimensional equations of mhd can be written in the form ( [ a1 ] ) ( e.g. brio & wu 1988 ) . the conserved quantities",
    "@xmath10 and the corresponding fluxes @xmath136 are @xmath137 & { \\bf f } = \\left [ { \\begin{array}{c } \\rho v_x \\\\ \\rho v_x^2 + p_g + b^2/2 - b_x^2 \\\\",

    "we use units such that the velocity of light and the factor @xmath141 do not appear",
    ".    as we have already discussed , ideal mhd has a supplementary conservation law representing the conservation of thermodynamic entropy .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics guarantees that the function @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the entropy per unit mass , is strictly concave ( e.g. terhaar & wergeland 1966 ) and hence that the matrix @xmath144 defined by ( [ 18 ] ) is positive definite . the system of mhd equations can therefore be written in the symmetric form ( [ 17 ] ) and is hyperbolic .",
    "although this has been demonstrated for relativistic mhd by ruggeri & strumia ( 1981 ) , we have been unable to find an account of the corresponding analysis for classical mhd in the literature",
    ". however , since the derivations are similar to those for the relativistic case , we shall simply give the symmetric variables .",
    "they are @xmath145    there is no need to verify that the matrix , @xmath68 , of dissipation coefficients is positive definite , since this must be true for any system that obeys the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , this condition is used to derive the dissipative equations in the first place ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1960 ) .",
    "the exact form of symmetrized equations is also of no importance for our purposes .",
    "their existence , does , however , allow us to apply the conclusions of the general theory described in sections 2 and 3 to dissipative mhd .",
    "since there are seven variables in this system , there are seven waves whose speeds are    [ cols=\"<,>,^ , < \" , ]     first of all , we need to establish whether the behaviour of numerical mhd shocks agrees with the predictions of the evolutionary theory . in order to do this , we adopt the following procedure .",
    "first we test whether a shock has a steady dissipative structure by setting up the relevant riemann problem and running the calculation until a well resolved steady dissipative shock structure is established , as expected for evolutionary and overdetermined shocks , or a completely different solution emerges , as expected for underdetermined shocks .",
    "if a steady structure exists , then we test to see whether it can survive small perturbations .",
    "this can be accomplished by considering a slightly different riemann problem , as in barmin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) or , like wu ( 1988a ) , allowing a small amplitude wave to interact with the shock .",
    "[ noshst ]    [ evsh ]      we start by discussing the results of the planar simulations .",
    "they show that if the initial discontinuity corresponds to a slow planar shock then a smooth steady shock structure connecting the initial left and right states finally develops and it does not matter whether the shock is @xmath146 or @xmath147 .",
    "the same thing happens for the fast planar shock and the overdetermined ( overcompressive ) @xmath148 shock .",
    "in contrast , figure 2 shows that @xmath149 shocks and alfvn shocks always turn into a slow compound wave .",
    "all this is exactly as perdicted by the theory described in ",
    "[ dis - str ] and  [ apple ] .",
    "our simulations can not be used to determine whether limit shocks , such @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , have a steady dissipative shock structure , simply because it is impossible to set up a shock whose speed is exactly equal to a characteristic speed .",
    "however , if we compute a riemann problem that corresponds to a compound wave of any of the types discussed above , the wave that is expected , or strictly speaking a solution close to such a wave , always emerges .",
    "this is hardly surprising because all of them have neighbouring solutions containing shocks with a steady dissipative structure .",
    "[ is14 ]    as is shown in figure  3 , evolutionary shocks always survive interactions with small amplitude waves and persist if the riemann problem is perturbed .",
    "figure  4 shows how a small variation of the initial data forces an overdetermined @xmath152 shock to split into two evolutionary shocks .",
    "depending on the form of the perturbation , the shock either splits into a @xmath153 shock followed by a @xmath154 shock or a @xmath155 shock followed by a @xmath156 shock .",
    "this is to be expected because , as one can see from figure  1 , a @xmath157 shock is exactly equivalent to one or other of these shock pairs propagating with the same speed .",
    "in fact , this result is in complete agreement with the analysis of the riemann problem for planar mhd in myong and roe ( 1997b ) .",
    "@xmath158 shocks , _ o - shocks _ in their notation , are only required on the boundary between the two domains of parameter space in which their solution involves a combination of fast and slow planar shocks ( s2 and s1 ) .",
    "the results for compound waves involving non - evolutionary shocks are similar .",
    "figure  1 shows that the non - evolutionary @xmath159 limit shock can be understood as a _",
    "double - layer _ shock composed of two evolutionary shocks , a @xmath153 and a @xmath160 . indeed ,",
    "if the riemann problem corresponding to a compound wave containing such a shock is perturbed , then in some cases the outcome is a @xmath153 shock and a slow compound wave and in other cases it is a @xmath161 shock and a detached slow rarefaction .",
    "_ all this can be summed up by saying that in planar mhd the behavior of shocks in our numerical simulations is entirely consistent with the classical evolutionary theory of shocks and the theory of dissipative shock structures as described in  [ sgeneral ] and  [ dis - str ] . _      since both fast ( @xmath153 ) and slow ( @xmath156 ) shocks satisfy the strong evolutionary condition in full mhd they are expected to have unique dissipative structure and be stable with respect to small perturbations of any kind .",
    "this is precisely what we find from our simulations .",
    "@xmath162 and @xmath163 shocks are overdetermined in full mhd and it is therefore possible that they might have a nonunique steady dissipative structure , indeed it turns out that they do .",
    "these shocks , as well as @xmath152 shocks , can now have a nonvanishing z - component of magnetic field inside the shock layer even if @xmath164 outside .",
    "for given the dissipative coefficients their stucture can be parameterised by the value of the following integral @xmath165 we can gradually increase or decrease the value of @xmath166 by sending from the downstream side of the shock an alfvn wave that first rotates the magnetic field by a small angle and then restores the original state .",
    "this wave is absorbed by the shock which develops a new steady structure ( see figure  5_a _ ) . however , like kennel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) we found that there is a maximum value of @xmath167 that the shock can manage .",
    "if this limit is exceeded , then the shock disintegrates ( see figure  _ b _ ) .",
    "this does not occur in the case of fast and slow shocks because the alfvn waves do not get trapped inside the shocks , but instead pass straight through .",
    "@xmath149 shocks have the right number of incoming characteristics and may therefore have a unique dissipative structure in full mhd .",
    "since such a structure does not exist in planar mhd , we can only expect to find them in our simulations by allowing a non - zero @xmath168 . in order to do this , we modified the initial data by inserting a layer in which the transverse field rotates smoothly from that in the original left state to that in the original right state .",
    "we found that the solution never relaxed to a smooth steady @xmath169 transition and were about to conclude that no steady structure exists until we realised that the solution shown in figure  5_b _ actually contains a @xmath149 shock , which was produced by the disintegration of the @xmath162 shock .",
    "we therefore we studied the reaction of a @xmath162 shock to an increase in @xmath166 .",
    "after absorbng another alfvn wave the shock splits and one of the emerging waves is again a @xmath149 shock but of smaller amplitude ( figure  6 ) .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the existence of a unique dissipative structure for @xmath170 shocks .",
    "in fact , what happens is that , as @xmath166 increases , the shock tends to an alfvn shock that rotates the transverse field by @xmath171    finally , we have also verified that all intermediate shocks and compound waves disintegrate when exposed to perturbations that render the left and right states non - coplanar .",
    "for example , figure  7 shows how @xmath161 and @xmath172 shocks split into evolutionary waves after interaction with a small amplitude alfvn wave .",
    "after the alfvn wave has been absorbed the transverse fields on either side of the shock are no longer parallel or antiparallel as required by the shock equations .",
    "the shock can only become coplanar by emitting alfvn waves , which , for an intermediate shock , can only be done in the downstream direction .",
    "however , since there is no downstream travelling alfvn wave that can restore the original post - shock state , the shock must split .",
    "this argument is not new , in fact it was used by kantrowitz & petschek ( 1966 ) to prove that intermediate shocks are unphysical .",
    "the wave designated as aw in figure  7 can be called a dissipative alfvn wave but it could also be described as an evolving @xmath173 shock with a gradually increasing value of @xmath166 .",
    "_ we therefore conclude that for full mhd the behaviour of shocks in our numerical simulations is also entirely consistent with the classical evolutionary theory of shocks and the theory of dissipative shock structures as described in ",
    "[ sgeneral ] and  [ dis - str ] . _    [ is13 ]    [ is23 ]    [ sinta ]    [ brio ]",
    "the results described in the previous sections have clarified many aspects of the shock theory in general and mhd shocks in particular and provide a basis upon which we can discuss other important , related , issues .",
    "one of the arguments in favour of non - evolutionary shocks used in current literature is that some riemann problems do not have a solution unless non - evolutionary shocks are admitted ( e.g. glimm 1988 , myong & roe 1997a , b ) .",
    "this is presumably based on the belief that any riemann problem must have a physically admissible solution .",
    "although this is certainly true for gas dynamics , there is surely no reason why this has to hold for any system .",
    "it all comes down to the notions of bifurcations and structural stability .",
    "one has to ask the following question : is it , or is it not , possible to carry out the relevant experiment in a laboratory ?",
    "if the qualitative result of the experiment does not change when the initial conditions are slightly changed , then the problem is structurally stable and the experiment is possible , at least in principle .",
    "however , if this is not true , then the problem is structurally unstable and no appropriate experiment is possible .",
    "it therefore follows that the set of structurally unstable riemann problem are confined to regions of parameter space whose total volume is zero .",
    "now suppose there is an mhd riemann problem that has no other solutions than those containing non - evolutionary shocks .",
    "since there are arbitrary small perturbations of the parameters that cause these shocks to split into evolutionary shocks , this riemann problem must be structurally unstable .",
    "in full mhd the only known case for which a non - evolutionary shock , a @xmath152 shock , is required is a piston problem in which the piston velocity is parallel to the magnetic field ( jeffrey & taniuti 1964 ) .",
    "if this condition is not exactly satisfied then the non - evolutionary shock does not arise .",
    "close inspection of the solution of the riemann problem for planar mhd presented by myong & roe ( 1997b ) shows that non - evolutionary shocks are required only on the boundaries between domains in parameter space that contain only evolutionary shocks .      another argument that appears to justify the existence of intermediate shocks",
    "is based on the results of numerical simulations by wu ( 1987 ) , which suggest that intermediate shocks can be formed by nonlinear steepening of simple magnetosonic waves . since the transverse component of magnetic field changes sign across an intermediate shock",
    "the simple wave must have the same property , which means that the transverse component of magnetic field must vanish somewhere within the wave .",
    "however , at this point the magnetosonic speed is equal to the alfvn speed and it is impossible to assign a unique eigenvector to the simple wave . as the result , the direction of the tangential component of the field can rotate by an arbitrary angle at this point so that simple wave really consists of two distinct parts , which are disconnected as far as the direction of the magnetic field is concerned .",
    "this can be put in a slightly different way .",
    "alfvn waves propagating in the same direction as such a simple wave can not pass throught the alfvn point . during the steepening",
    "they will accumulate near this point giving rise to a net field rotation so that the discontinuity that forms has non - coplanar left and right states and can therefore not be a single shock .",
    "instead , it must split into evolutionary shocks , one of which must be an alfvn shock . incidentally , this seems to be the only way of generating alfvn shocks",
    ".    however , in planar mhd the transition through the alfvnic point is unique and as we have seen some of the intermediate shocks are in fact evolutionary .",
    "this is the explanation for the outcome of the planar simulations performed by wu ( 1987 ) .",
    "he also found that the results were not very different if the initial data was perturbed so that it was no longer exactly coplanar .",
    "however , because of the periodic boundary conditions used in this simulation , there was no net rotation in the perturbed problem , which makes it rather artificial .",
    "the reason why this perturbation did not destroy the intermediate shock is that these boundary conditions , together with the initial data , only allowed a small value of @xmath166 per shock .",
    "it is therefore hardly surprising that an intermediate shock appeared since , as we have shown , these shocks can survive if @xmath166 is small enough .",
    "let us suppose that an intermediate shock has somehow been formed and then interacts with an alfvn wave that rotates the magnetic field by a small angle @xmath174 .",
    "it is clearly of some importance to know how long it takes for the shock to split .",
    "our simulations show that it splits when the the value of @xmath166 associated with the shock structure becomes comparable with @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the shock thickness .",
    "if the incident alfvn wave has a small amplitude , @xmath177 , then this gives us the following estimate for the disintegration time , @xmath178    @xmath179    where we have used the alfvn speed as a characteristic fluid velocity in the shock frame .",
    "this also tells us that the shock will only propagate for a distance @xmath180 before it falls apart . from this",
    "we conclude that in all cases for which the dissipative scale is much smaller then the characteristic length scale of the flow , intermediate shocks can only appear as very short lived time - dependent phenomena .",
    "it is instructive to apply equation ( [ 46 ] ) to the interplanetary intermediate shock for which chao et al .",
    "( 1993 ) claim to have found evidence in the voyager 1 data . in this case @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which gives @xmath183 .",
    "the flow time for the solar wind at this distance ( @xmath184 ) is @xmath185 .",
    "it is therefore clear that @xmath177 would have to be ridiculously small for the shock to survive for a significant fraction of a flow time .",
    "this is most unlikely since the flow of the solar wind is sufficiently complex to contain plenty of alfvn waves for which @xmath186 and indeed chao et al .",
    "find plenty of evidence for strong alfvn waves in the data .",
    "actually , the evidence for an intermediate shock is not really very convincing .",
    "the uncertainties are such that it could just as well be a slow shock .",
    "exactly the same arguments can be applied to the magnetohydrodynamic shocks in the interstellar medium .",
    "not only does the theory of collisionless shocks ( see e.g. tidman & krall 1971 ) predict that , in these conditions , such shocks are extremely thin compared to the scale of the flow but there are numerous observations that confirm that this is indeed true ( see e.g. draine & mckee 1993 ) .      from the above discussion",
    "it is quite clear that a hyperbolic system is genuinely non - convex if it allows structurally stable compound waves that only contain evolutionary shocks .",
    "planar mhd is therefore genuinely non - convex whereas full mhd is convex .",
    "the appearance of non - evolutionary shocks in numerical calculations is not something that is unique to mhd since it is well known that , even in gas dynamics , some numerical schemes can generate expansion shocks in certain circumstances .",
    "however , this phenomenon is both more subtle and more interesting in the case of mhd .",
    "the essential point is that , unlike gas dynamics , planar mhd is is very different from full mhd in the sense that there are shocks that are non - evolutionary in full mhd , but evolutionary in planar mhd and vice - versa .",
    "unfortunately , this property means that the results of planar mhd simulations can be very misleading because , although most upwind schemes seem to give perfectly good solutions for planar mhd , these are of no relevance to the real universe with its three spatial dimensions .",
    "this is not at all unusual , indeed it may very well be the rule rather than the exception .",
    "for example , the properties of fluid turbulence are very different in two and three dimensions as are those of magnetohydrodynamic dynamos .    the other properties of non - evolutionary mhd shocks , that are not shared by gas dynamical expansion shocks , are that all of them satisfy the second law of thermodynamics and most of them also possess a steady dissipative structure .",
    "this , together with the fact that the ratio of the thickness of numerical shock structures to the overall scale of the flow is almost always many orders of magnitude greater than in the corresponding physical system , means that they can persist for a significant time even in nonplanar problems .",
    "for example , if the piston problem discussed by jeffrey & taniuti ( 1964 , p. 256258 ) is slightly modified so that it has a small transverse component of the field , then the evolutionary solution contains fast , slow and alfvn shocks all propagating with very similar speeds . in a numerical simulation this complex would remain unresolved for some time , during which it would be classified as a @xmath152 shock .",
    "the only truly satisfactory solution to this difficulty is to devise schemes that only allow evolutionary shocks .",
    "figure  8 shows that there are schemes that will do this .",
    "here we have a numerical solution to the brio & wu problem obtained with our mhd version of glimm s scheme ( glimm 1965 ) .",
    "this method requires a nonlinear riemann solver and we employ the one described in falle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which specifically excludes intermediate shocks .",
    "in fact we do not use glimm s scheme everywhere , but only to track the alfvn shock .",
    "one can see that in this way we can avoid the appearance of intermediate shocks even in planar problems .",
    "unfortunately , it is not a simple matter to generalise this to more than one dimension .",
    "the only viable option , that we can think of , is to subject all numerical calculations to a careful analysis using the theory described in this paper .",
    "as an example of this , it is instructive look at some recent calculations of steady mhd flow past a cylinder .",
    "recently , de sterck et al.(1998 ) have carried out numerical mhd calculations of the flow past an infinite , perfectly conducting cylinder .",
    "these are planar simulations and must therefore be interpreted in the light of the theory of planar mhd .",
    "the parameters are chosen in such way that the usual convex bow shock is impossible .",
    "instead , the analysis given in steinolfson & hundhausen ( 1990 ) suggests that the shock has a dimple .",
    "they assumed that there is only a single shock , in which case a cosistent solution requires the shock type to change from @xmath187 to @xmath188 and then to @xmath189 as the distance from the symmetry axis decreases .",
    "although the @xmath158 shock is non - evolutionary even in planar mhd , in this case it seems that such a shock must occur on the symmetry axis for the same reason that it occurs when a piston moves parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "however , one would expect it to split into @xmath187 and @xmath190 or @xmath188 and @xmath191 shocks further away from the the axis .",
    "indeed , de sterck et al.(1998 ) find that not far from the axis the @xmath192 shock splits and the leading shock ( ed in their notation ) is a @xmath153 . at some distance from this branching point",
    "the other shock ( eg ) is identified by them as @xmath193 , but this is unlikely to be true everywhere for such an inhomogeneous flow .",
    "one would also expect another branching at the point where steinolfson & hundhausen ( 1990 ) predict a transition from @xmath194 to @xmath195 .",
    "the results of de sterck et al.(1998 ) do , indeed , show this branching ( de and dg ) , with the trailing shock being clearly identifiable as a @xmath190 shock .",
    "both our analysis and numerical results show that the evolutionary conditions for existence and uniqueness of discontinuous solutions of the equations of ideal mhd are not only compatible with the conditions for existence and uniqueness of steady dissipative shock structures , they are actually complementary to them .",
    "the general theory suggests that this will be true for all nonlinear hyperbolic systems that can arise in nature .",
    "non - evolutionary shock can have a nonunique dissipative structure and may , perhaps , appear under some exeptional curcumstances as transient phenomena .",
    "however , they are not persistent and are bound to split when subjected to small perturbations . in the case of mhd , alfvn waves are the most effective killers since not only our calculations but also those described by wu ( 1988a ) show that intermediate mhd shocks are destroyed by interactions with alfvn waves .",
    "it is true that it takes a finite time for this interaction to take place , but in any physical system that we know of , this time is so short that it is most unlikely that such shocks can be detected .",
    "the occurrence of intermediate mhd shocks in planar numerical simulations is consistent with the mathematical properties of planar mhd , in which @xmath196 and @xmath190 shocks become evolutionary but the alfvn shock becomes non - evolutionary .",
    "however , the planar limit is a singular limit of full mhd and we suggest that planar numerical simulations should be avoided , especially since they are hardly any cheaper than for full mhd .",
    "intermediate shocks may even pollute full mhd simulations because numerical shock structures are usually not very thin compared to the length scale of the flow .",
    "it is therefore essential that the results of such simulations be subjected to a careful analysis in order to make sure that they do not contain any intermediate shocks .",
    "if they do , then additional work is required to determine the extent to which they are corrupted .",
    "the results of our calculations with glimm s scheme show that this problem can be eliminated in numerical schemes that treat shocks especially alfvn shocks , as discontinuities ."
