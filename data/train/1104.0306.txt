    "the aim of this paper is to develop a theory of existence and uniqueness , as well as to obtain the main qualitative properties , for a family of nonlinear fractional diffusion equations of porous medium type .",
    "more specifically , we consider the cauchy problem @xmath10 u(x,0 ) = f(x ) , & \\qquad x\\in\\mathbb{r}^n.\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] we take initial data @xmath1 , which is a standard assumption in diffusion problems , with no sign restriction . as for the exponents , we consider the fractional exponent range @xmath2 , and take porous medium exponent @xmath3 . in the limit @xmath11 we recover the standard porous medium equation ( pme ) @xmath12 which is a basic model for nonlinear and degenerate diffusion , having now a well - established theory @xcite .    the nonlocal operator @xmath13 , known as the laplacian of order @xmath9 , is defined for any function @xmath14 in the schwartz class through the fourier transform : if @xmath15 , then @xmath16 if @xmath2 , we can also use the representation by means of an hypersingular kernel , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a normalization constant , see for example @xcite .",
    "there is another classical way of defining the fractional powers of a linear self - adjoint nonnegative operator , in terms of the associated semigroup , which in our case reads @xmath19 it is easy to check that the symbol of this operator is again @xmath20 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it gives a natural way of defining the problem in a bounded domain , by means of the spectral characterization of the semigroup @xmath21 , see @xcite .",
    "the problem posed in a bounded domain is also studied in this paper .",
    "equations of the form can be seen as fractional - diffusion versions of the pme .",
    "though our paper is aimed at providing a sound mathematical theory for this evolution equation and the nonlinear semigroups generated by problem and the problem posed on bounded domains , we mention that the equation appears as a model in statistical mechanics @xcite , and the linear counterpart in @xcite .",
    "we also want to point out that there are other natural options of nonlinear , possibly degenerate fractional - diffusion evolutions under current investigation .",
    "thus , the papers @xcite , @xcite consider the following fractional diffusion pme   @xmath22 .",
    "it has very different properties from the ones we derive for .",
    "the standard pme ( with @xmath23 ) is recovered in such model for @xmath24 .",
    "a more detailed discussion on these issues is contained in the survey paper @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of equations can be also viewed as nonlinear versions of the linear fractional diffusion equation obtained for @xmath25 , which has the integral representation @xmath26 where @xmath27 has fourier transform @xmath28 .",
    "this means that , for @xmath2 , the kernel @xmath27 has the form @xmath29 for some profile function @xmath30 that is positive and decreasing , and behaves at infinity like @xmath31 @xcite . when @xmath32 , @xmath30 is explicit ; if @xmath33 the function @xmath34 is the gaussian heat kernel .",
    "the linear model has been well studied by probabilists , since the fractional laplacians of order @xmath9 are infinitesimal generators of stable lvy processes @xcite , @xcite . however , an integral representation of the evolution like is not available in the nonlinear case , thus motivating our work .    in a previous article",
    "@xcite we studied problem for the particular case @xmath32 .",
    "the key tool there was the well - known representation of the half - laplacian in terms of the dirichlet - neumann operator , which allowed us to formulate the nonlocal problem in terms of a local one ( i.e. , involving only derivatives and not integral operators ) . for @xmath35 , caffarelli and silvestre @xcite have recently given a similar characterization of the laplacian of order @xmath9 in terms of the so - called @xmath9-harmonic extension , which is the solution of an elliptic problem with a degenerate or singular weight .",
    "however , even with this local characterization at hand , many of the proofs that we gave for @xmath32 can not be adapted to cope with a general @xmath9 .",
    "hence we have needed to use new tools , which in several cases do not involve the extension .",
    "these techniques , which include some new functional inequalities , have also allowed us to improve the results obtained in @xcite for the case @xmath32 .",
    "the case of a bounded domain was not treated in that paper .",
    "as in the case of the pme , there is a unified theory of existence and uniqueness of a suitable concept of _ weak _ solution above a critical exponent , given for a general @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",

    "the precise definition of weak solution that guarantees uniqueness is stated in definition [ def : weak.solution.nonlocal ] or equivalently in definition [ def : weak.solution ] .",

    "let @xmath58 and let @xmath80 be the extinction time .",
    "then @xmath81 for some @xmath62 .",
    "we will make a series of comments on these two results .",
    "first , we point out that the result on the conservation of mass for @xmath73 is new even for @xmath32 .",
    "a more essential observation is that there is an alternative approach : using the results of crandall and pierre @xcite we can obtain the existence of a unique so - called _ mild _ solution for all @xmath1 in the whole range of @xmath82 and @xmath9 , via the abstract theory of accretive operators .",
    "this approach has therefore the advantage of having general scope .",
    "two problems arise with this way of looking at the problem : ( a )  how to characterize the mild solution in differential terms ; and ( b )  how to derive its properties .",
    "our paper answers both questions .",
    "the strong solutions that we have constructed are mild solutions .",
    "hence , in our restricted range of initial data the unique mild solution is a strong solution . for a general @xmath1 and @xmath83",
    ", we will show that the mild solution is a _ very weak _ solution ( a solution in the sense of distributions ) , see theorem  [ th : mild.very.weak ] .",
    "however , we will fail to prove that this very weak solution is a weak solution in the sense of definition [ def : weak.solution.nonlocal ] , and hence we will not be able to obtain the properties listed above ( bit note that the @xmath5-contraction holds since it is a consequence of the accretivity of the operator ) .    as to the continuous dependence of the solution in terms of the parameters , convergence in @xmath84 is not expected to hold for @xmath85 , since mass is not conserved in that region .",
    "instead we expect to have continuity in weighted spaces , much in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to extend the continuous dependence result of theorem  [ th : properties]-(viii ) to cover the case @xmath73 for @xmath86 , see proposition  [ th : cont ] .",
    "we also show that continuity holds in the upper limit @xmath87 , thus recovering the standard pme , see theorem  [ th : cont.sigma2 ] .",
    "if @xmath88 and @xmath89 belong to the schwartz class , definition of the fractional laplacian together with plancherel s theorem yield @xmath90 therefore , if we multiply the equation in by a test function @xmath89 and integrate by parts , as usual , we obtain @xmath91 this identity will be the basis of our definition of a weak solution .    the integrals in make sense if @xmath41 and @xmath92 belong to suitable spaces .",

    "is used in the statement to recall that we are making a very definite choice .    the main disadvantage in using this definition",
    "is that there is no formula for the fractional laplacian of a product , or of a composition of functions .",
    "moreover , there is no benefit in using compactly supported test functions since their fractional laplacian loses this property . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we will use the fact that our solution @xmath41 is the trace of the solution of a _ local _ problem obtained by extending @xmath92 to a half - space whose boundary is our original space .",
