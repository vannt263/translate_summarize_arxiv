    "solitary waves are self - guided wave packets as they propagate in nonlinear media , remaining localized and preserving their own shape .",

    "_ soliton _ belongs to a special family of solitary waves that are unaffected by collisions .",

    "combination of kerr nonlinear material and photonic crystals , nonlinear photonic crystals have revealed a wealth of nonlinear optical phenomena and , in particular , self - trapped nonlinear localized modes in the form of so called gap solitons @xcite .",
    "gap solitons are unique solutions which can be formed no matter in focusing or defocusing media due to the change of the dispersion / diffraction effect caused by the photonic lattices @xcite . current technology in reconfigurable optical lattices , such as photorefractive crystals @xcite and nematic liquid crystals @xcite , also pave a new way to control solitary waves by varying the lattice depth and period .    with both benefits from photonic crystals and solitons , gap soliton is believed to be an important key footstone in soliton - driven photonics . for kerr - type nonlinear photonic crystals , the bifurcation and stability of gap solitons in internal reflection and bragg gap regions are studied with local nonlinear response @xcite",
    ". however , the limited mobility of gap soliton in the transverse directions due to corresponding lattice potentials draws great concerns for various switching and routing operations @xcite .",
    "recently it has been predicted that with _ non - locality _ solitons can move across the lattice drastically easily in the internal reflection region @xcite .",
    "nonlocal effect comes to play an important role as the characteristic response function of the medium is comparable to the transverse content of the wave packet @xcite",
    ". experimental observations of nonlocal response also have been demonstrated in various systems , such as photorefractive crystals @xcite , nematic liquid crystals @xcite , and thermo - optical materials @xcite .",
    "the study of nonlocal nonlinearity brings new features in solitons @xcite , such as modification of modulation instability @xcite , azimuthal instability @xcite , and transverse instability @xcite .",
    "suppression of collapse in multidimensional solitons @xcite , change of the soliton interaction @xcite , formation of soliton bound states @xcite and unique families of dark - bright soliton pairs @xcite are also predicted recently .    for nonlocal nonlinear medium , the non - locality is known to improve the stabilization of solitons due to the diffusion mechanism of nonlinearity . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , the existences , stabilities , mobilities , and collisions of gap solitons in bragg gap regions have not been reported . in this work ,",
    "we extend the concept of gap solitons in nonlocal nonlinear photonic crystals @xcite , from internal reflection to bragg gap regions . the propagation and stability of gap solitons with an imprinted transverse index modulation under the influence of nonlocal effect are studied . with the oscillation nature of wave packets in the bragg regions ,",
    "we show that gap soliton are more stable and movable even with a small degree of non - locality .",
    "this work is organized as follows , first we show that in the band gap region nonlinear bloch wave can support bright soliton solutions .",
    "families of even and odd modes of bright gap solitons imprinted onto bloch wave in local and nonlocal non - linearities are found numerically .",
    "then the modulation instability of these nonlocal gap soliton families are analyzed by a standard linear stability analysis , and the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potentials that inhibit the mobility of the gap solitons are also calculated in terms of nonlocality .",
    "finally , we address the transverse mobility and soliton interactions under the influence of non - locality with the presence of periodic potentials .",
    "based on the dramatic reduction of the pn potential barrier for gap solitons in bragg regions , we demonstrate a non - trivial elastic - like collision between gap solitons , which should be useful for optical switching devices based on soliton collisions .",
    "we consider a wave packet propagating along the @xmath0 axis in the nonlocal nonlinear photonic crystals with a kerr - type nonlinearity and an exponential - type nonlocal response , which can be modeled by the modified nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the envelope function of the wave packet , @xmath3 is the transverse coordinate , and @xmath4 is the refractive index profile induced by the exponential - type kernel function responding to the intensity soliton intensity @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : f4](a , b ) illustrate that nonlocal effect significantly reduces the growth rate of unstable spectral mode for off - site solitons in the internal reflection @xcite as well as the first bragg gap regions .",
    "furthermore , off - site gap solitons in the first bragg gap region suffer stronger suppression of instability due to the diffusion of refractive index than the case in the internal reflection region .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] clearly , with a small strength of non - locality the modulation instability of gap solitons in bragg gap region is impressively suppressed .",
    "a simple reason is that nonlocal effect can smooth over the oscillation tails of refractive index @xmath42 due to the diffusion mechanism . in other words , the smoothness of refractive index",
    "@xmath42 indicates that the effective potential @xmath43 turns more broadened .",
    "therefore , as the strength of long range interaction increases , soliton solutions become more stable due to the broadening effect of the effective potential , especially in the bragg gap region . because gap soliton solutions in the bragg gap regions access oscillation tails and their profiles extend more apparently in space , in such a way the nonlocal effect become more apparently to smooth out the effective potential and to stabilize solitons .    .",

    "pn potential barrier defines the minimum energy required to move the center of mass of a localized wave packet by one lattice site @xcite . extending this definition to the continuous system",

    "it is clearly seen that in the first bragg gap region the pn potential barrier is drastically reduced in comparison to the local nonlinearity , @xmath32 , as well as the internal reflection region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f5](a ) . with the oscillation tails similar to the linear bloch waves , nonlocal solitons in the bragg gap regions",
    "are more stable and more movable than those in the internal reflection band @xcite .",

    "the reduction of the pn barrier is confirmed by numerical simulations of eq.([eqgp1 ] ) for gap solitons with fixed power but different initial kinetic energies .",
    "the initial conditions for fig . [",
    "fig : f5](b ) are set with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the stationary solution in bragg gap region and @xmath53 stands for transverse momentum at incidence .",
    "when soliton crosses the lattice it radiates and loses energy .",
    "eventually these gap solitons are captured by one of the lattice channel .",
    "however , while the nonlocality effect comes to play , the total effective potential is shallowed by long range interaction .",
    "these nonlocal gap solitons are more free to move in the transverse direction due to a lower pn potential height .    based on the results of the pn potential barrier reduction for solitons in the bragg gap regions with non - locality , we demonstrate a potential - free collisions between two gap solitons within the photonic crystals",
    "it is well known that without periodic potentials , solitons experience elastic collisions when the relative phase between them is in - phase .",
    "the elastic collision between two solitons is destructed in the photonic systems due to the confinement of the pn potential barrier , as shown in fig.[fig : f6](a ) for the local case with @xmath32 .",
    "but with nonlocal nonlinear response , in fig.[fig : f6](b ) we show that gap solitons can revive an elastic - like collision even in the photonic systems . in principle , the collisions between gap solitons are very complicated and unpredicted due to the interplays among nonlinearity , periodic potential height , and dispersion / diffraction effects .",
    "nonetheless , in this simulation , only with a small strength of non - locality , @xmath54 one can have a clear picture of gap soliton interactions .",
    "in conclusion , we demonstrate the existence of gap soliton solutions in nonlocal nonlinear photonic crystals in the internal reflection and bragg gap regions .",
    "the stability and mobility of such novel gap solitons are calculated through the linear stability method and the peierls - nabarro potential barrier . compared to the internal reection region ,",
    "nonlocal gap solitons in the bragg gap regions become not only more stable but also more movable due to the oscillation tails of wave packets .",
    "moreover we reveal that it is possible to have elastic - like collisions between gap solitons with the help of a small strength of nonlocal effect .",
    "supported by the result of this study and current technology about controllable nonlocal nonlinear media , such as photorefractive crystals , nematic liquid crystals and thermo - optical materials , we believe the results in this work should provide a new way for soliton - based photonic devices .",
