    "_ graph states _ , forming a universal resourse for quantum computation based on masurement ,",
    "have been used in many applications in quantum information theory as well as quantum computation , and have been studied extensively .",
    "this is due to the fact that these states not only maintain a rich structure , but also can be described transparently in different ways .",
    "for example , the notion of _ entanglement _ , the significant property of quantum systems compared to the classical ones , has been widely studied for graph states , for instance see @xcite . on the other hand , the properties of _ stabilizer codes _ , the most well - studied class of quantum codes ,",
    "are really covered by graph states .",
    "these states have been studied in this point of view too , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .      to overview the definitions , recall",
    "that pauli group is the group generated by pauli operators , and clifford group is its normalizer , generated by hadamard , cnot and the phase gates , @xcite .",
    "a stabilizer state is the common eigenvalue of a ( full rank ) abelian subgroup of pauli group .",
    "since , clifford group is the normalizer of pauli group , any stabilizer state is sent to another stabilizer state under clifford operators .",
    "on the other hand , local operators do not change the properties of a state in the quantum information theory point of view .",
    "therefore , we say two stabilizer states are equivalent if they can be sent to each other under some local clifford operators .",
    "graph states are a special class of stabilizer states that are defined based on a graph , and are of interest because of two reason .",
    "first , they can be represented just by a graph which is both succinct and also , captures all the properties of the state .",
    "second , it can be proven that any stabilizer state is equivalent to a graph state under the action of local clifford group , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , it says that in order to study stabilizer states it is sufficient to study graph states that have a more simple representation .    as an example , we know that a clifford operator sends a stabilizer state to another one . therefore , translating this action to their associated graphs , we find a description of local clifford group in the language of graphs .",
    "this fact is first discovered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that pauli measurements can be translated in the language of graph theory .    here",
    ", a question arises naturally .",
    "can two graph states be equivalent under local clifford group ?",
    "the answer , by simply trying some examples , is yes .",
    "so as the second question , one may ask how many graph states can be equivalent to a given one ?    there are some recent works to answer these questions , and also to relate the latter results of graph theory in this direction . for example , @xcite and @xcite have presented an algorithm to recognize whether two given graph states are equivalent or not .",
    "the other question is that what the number of different graph states is .",
    "of course , by different graph states we mean states that are neither isomorphic nor equivalent under the local clifford group , and isomorphic states means they are the same by relabeling their qubits .",
    "in @xcite the number of graph states , which are non - isomorphic and not equivalent , is counted for @xmath0 up to 12 , where @xmath0 is the number of qubits .",
    "there is no a known method yet , to count them in general .      in this paper , we first find a bound on the number of graph states that are neither isomorphic nor equivalent under the local clifford group .",
    "it is the first such a bound .",
    "in the second part of this paper we try to answer the same questions for the non - binary case , i. e. qudits , where @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , pauli group is well - know for the non - binary quantum systems , too .",
    "also , clifford group , same as binary case , is defined to be the normalizer of the pauli group , and in @xcite there is an interesting characterization of this generalized clifford group .",
    "so that , stabilizer states , and then graph states , can be defined same as binary case .",
    "although , all these notions were known ( for example see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , but we did not know anything about the action of local clifford group in this case .    here",
    ", we first show that any stabilizer state is equivalent to a graph state under local clifford group , same as what we had in binary case .",
    "then , we focus on non - binary graph states and translate the action of local clifford group and also pauli measurements to some operators on graphs .    after this paper , these operators over graphs have been studied , and in @xcite an efficient algorithm is presented that given two graph states , determines whether they are equivalent or not .",
    "we present this result here , too .",
    "the notions of stabilizer states and also graphs states ( in binary case ) are well - known in the theory and we do not repeat them here .",
    "we just refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a full survey on this subject .",
    "it is known that two graph states are equivalent under local clifford group if and only if their associated graphs are equivalent under _ local complementation _ operators ( see for instance @xcite ) , by which we mean the following operator .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a vertex of a graph @xmath3 .",
    "to _ locally complement _ @xmath3 at @xmath2 , consider all neighbors of @xmath2 in @xmath3 and complement the subgraph of @xmath3 induced by these vertices to obtain a new graph , denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "two graphs are called _ locally equivalent _ if one of them is obtained from the other by a series of local complementations .",
    "this notion have been extensively studied in graph theory , see @xcite . also , there is a polynomial time algorithm to recognize whether two graphs are locally equivalent or not , @xcite .",
    "a _ tree _ is a connected graph which contains no cycle .",
    "the following theorem is a significant result on locally equivalent graphs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ tree ]    any two locally equivalent trees are isomorphic .    by this theorem ,",
    "if two trees are not isomorphic then they are not locally equivalent , and then , the number of non - isomorphic trees on @xmath0 vertices is a lower bound on the number graphs which are not locally equivalent .",
    "note that , there are graphs that are not locally equivalent to a tree , and so , the number of trees is not a tight bound .",
    "however , it is the only known bound of this type .",
    "the following theorem gives us an approximation of the number of non - isomorphic trees .",
    "this bound is proved in @xcite .",
    "[ count ]    let @xmath5 be the number of non - isomorphic trees on @xmath0 vertices , then @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    we thus obtain the following result , presenting a lower bound for the number of non - equivalent graph states under the action of local clifford group , whose graphs are connected and mutually non - isomorphic .",
    "[ count ]    let @xmath9 be the number of graph states which are locally equivalent to some tree . then for large enough values of @xmath0 @xmath10    where @xmath7 .",
    "* @xmath9 is a lower bound for @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the number of graph states which are not equivalent under the local clifford group , and their associate graphs are connected and non - isomorphic .",
    "but , is this bound a good one ?    for a fixed graph @xmath3 , there is an algorithm to count the number of graphs locally equivalent to @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this number varies from one graph to another .",
    "for instance , the number of graphs locally equivalent to the complete graph over @xmath0 vertices is @xmath12 , but this number for a path of length @xmath0 is @xmath13 .",
    "hence , it can vary from linear to exponential , for different graphs .",
    "this observation shows that the problem of finding the exact number of non - equivalent graphs is relatively a hard one .",
    "the lower bound presented in the remark above is in fact the best lower bound known so far , which can be compared to the real values of @xmath11 for small @xmath0 s in table 1 .    [",

    "suppose that the stabilizer group of a state is generated by @xmath254 and we measure @xmath255 .",
    "assume that @xmath256 .",
    "if @xmath257 s are all zero then @xmath55 commutes with all of @xmath120 s , and therefore the outcome of the measurement is the state itself , with the unchanged stabilizer group .",
    "otherwise , there exists at least one non - zero @xmath257 . by changing the set of generators for stabilizer group ( using lemma [ 4 ] )",
    ", we can assume that @xmath258 is non - zero , and @xmath259 , @xmath260 .",
    "therefore @xmath261 is a set of generators for the state after the measurement , in which @xmath106 is the outcome of measurement .",
    "we use this idea to translate the local pauli measurements to operations on graphs . in order to do so",
    ", we need the following definition .",
    "* definition . *",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is a labeled graph on @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a vertex of @xmath3 , define @xmath262 to be a graph on the same vertex set , but all neighborhood edges of @xmath2 have zero labels .",
    "[ measx ]    suppose we have a graph state with label matrix @xmath162 and we measure the operator @xmath263 , that is @xmath21 on the @xmath153-th qupit .",
    "then if @xmath264 for all @xmath265 then the state remains unchanged , and if @xmath266 for some @xmath186 , then the state after the measurement is equivalent to    @xmath267    if @xmath264 , then @xmath263 commutes with the stabilizer group , and therefore , the state remains unchanged after the measurement .",
    "thus , let us suppose that @xmath266 for some @xmath186 , and let @xmath268 .",
    "now @xmath269 is also a generator matrix for the graph state ( lemma [ 4 ] ) , where @xmath270 and non - zero off - diagonal entries are on @xmath186-th column .",
    "we observe that @xmath263 commutes with all of the rows of @xmath269 , except the @xmath186-th one .",
    "hence , if we replace the @xmath186-th row by @xmath271 we obtain the generator matrix for the new state . on the other hand , by lemma [ 7 ]",
    ", every stabilizer state is equivalent to a graph state under the local clifford group , and if we apply this process to the new generator matrix we end up with the generator matrix @xmath272 , where @xmath182 is the matrix of the the graph @xmath267    the changes after measuring the operator @xmath273 on a graph state is presented in the following theorem .",
    "[ measxz ]    consider a graph state with label matrix @xmath162 , and suppose that one measures the operator @xmath273 on the @xmath153-th qupit , where @xmath274 are non - zero .",
    "then the state after measurement is equivalent to @xmath275 .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath264 for every @xmath186 .",
    "in this case @xmath273 commutes with all of the generators , except the @xmath153-th one .",
    "so , if we replace it by @xmath276 where @xmath277 and @xmath176 both locate on the @xmath153-th entries , then , using the local clifford group , we obtain the same generator matrix and the same graph .",
    "notice that in this case , @xmath275 is same as @xmath3 .    therefore , assume that @xmath266 for some @xmath186 , and let @xmath268 . clearly , @xmath278 is also a generator matrix for the stabilizer group , where @xmath270 and again , non - zero off - diagonal entries are on @xmath186-th column .",
    "it is easy to check that all of the rows of @xmath278 , except the @xmath186-th one , commute with @xmath273 .",
    "hence , if we replace it by the row - representation of @xmath273 we get to a generator for the new state . applying the algorithm to get a graph state from this state ( lemma [ 7 ] ) , we obtain that the new graph is @xmath279 .    and finally , measuring the operator @xmath280 has some affects on the graph states , described below in details .",
    "[ measz ]    suppose that @xmath3 is a graph state with label matrix @xmath162 , and we measure the operator @xmath280 on the @xmath153-th qupit , where @xmath176 is non - zero .",
    "then the state after this measurement is equivalent to @xmath281 .",
    "consider the generating matrix @xmath282 of the graph state .",
    "we know that all of the rows of this matrix , except the @xmath153-th one , are orthogonal to the row - representation of @xmath280 , which is @xmath283 .",
    "therefore , after the measurement , the stabilizer group is in fact the group generated by the rows of @xmath282 , except the @xmath153-th one , and @xmath280 .",
    "therefore , the stabilizer state , after deleting the @xmath153-th qupit , is @xmath284",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath188 be two connected graphs , with label matrices @xmath162 and @xmath189 , and assume that these two graphs are equivalent under the action of local clifford group .",
    "notice that by operations @xmath190 and @xmath191 , a connected graph remains connected .",
    "therefore , by lemma 6@xmath155 , there exists a matrix @xmath150 such that @xmath146 where @xmath285 @xmath286 and @xmath144 , for any @xmath153 ; in addition , the rows of @xmath287 and @xmath288 are orthogonal .    in order to rephrase these conditions , by abuse of notation , consider each diagonal block as a vector .",

    "it means that , our problem is reduced to checking the equation ( [ det1 ] ) for these solutions .",
    "but , the space of solutions may have a large dimension , and it may take an exponential time to check it for all solutions . on the other hand , it is proved in @xcite that if the dimension of the solutions is large enough , then , there exists an affine subspace of _ large _ dimension satisfying equation ( [ det1 ] ) .",
