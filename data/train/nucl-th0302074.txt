    "@xcite ) , where they have studied the effect of the @xmath1 over the longitudinal response using the ble . as in our case , they have considered both the direct excitation of a @xmath17-pair and the effect of the @xmath1 over the response through many - body contributions .",
    "they have also incorporated relativistic effects and done the comparison with @xmath175 data for @xmath174 400 , 500 and 600 mev / c .",
    "their final results underestimate the experimental points . using a different formalism and interaction",
    ", this work agrees with our results in two main issues : the direct excitation of a @xmath17-pair is not significant and the many - body effect of the @xmath1 is important .    the main difference between our scheme and those of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is the way in which we deal with the pauli exchange terms . in several works",
    "( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , we have determined that exchange terms are important and need to be accurately evaluated .",
    "if we now incorporate the transverse channel into the discussion , there are many contributions like meson exchange currents and ground state correlations beyond the rpa , which also need to be considered . however , in the longitudinal channel these terms are less relevant than in the transverse one . moreover , the interaction utilized in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is different than ours ( in fact , each work employs a different one ) .",
    "this point is particularly important not only because of the sensibility of the results over the interaction , but also because antisymmetrization establishes constrains over the interaction ( see ref .",
    "let us be more specific about these constrains .",
    "when an antisymmetric matrix element is evaluated , the antisymmetrization operator can act either over the initial and final state or over the interaction itself .",
    "it is possible to build up an antisymmetric interaction where the prescription is to evaluate direct matrix elements with this force .",
    "this is equivalent to employ the non - antisymetrized interaction with direct and exchange matrix elements .",
    "when the antisymmetric interaction is employed , the different channels of the interaction ( for instance , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 in a landau - migdal type interaction ) , are not independent : a change in one affects all the others . as the rpa longitudinal and transverse responses are dominated by different channels of the interaction , the just mentioned constrains should be carefully considered when dealing with both channels .",
    "alternatively , the employment of any non - antisymetrized interaction within a scheme which accurately evaluates exchange terms is equivalent , as just mentioned .",
    "in a forthcoming work we will discuss this issue in detail  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have analyzed the longitudinal response of the inclusive electron scattering process . we have presented a formalism developed for non - relativistic nuclear matter , which includes correlations of the srpa type .",
    "the @xmath1-degree of freedom was incorporated via two mechanisms : the direct excitation of a @xmath17-pair and through self - energy contributions which contains the @xmath1 .",
    "our scheme puts special emphasis on the evaluation of pauli exchange terms .",
    "by the employment of an effective fermi momentum we have evaluated the response for @xmath2 at several momentum transfers , obtaining a good agreement with data .",
    "these results were obtained as a consequence of the addition of several ingredients , which basically can be grouped into two sets : the opening of new decay channels ( as @xmath178 , @xmath179 , etc . ; represented by the second order self - energies ) which reduce the height of the quasi - elastic peak and spread the response , but moves the peak towards lower energies . and",
    "in the second group we put the hartre - fock self - energy and the rpa , which moves the peak to higher energies , but do not provide the required reduction of the intensity . in both cases",
    "the action of the exchange terms and the election of the interaction is very important .    in many works",
    ", it is mentioned that the longitudinal response seems more elusive than the transverse one , even though the underlying physics is more complex in the last case . in view of our results",
    ", we think that the just mentioned assertion should be revised . referring this affirmation",
    "we recall that , @xmath180 the first experimental results which separates the longitudinal and transverse channels  @xcite , underestimate the longitudinal response .",
    "@xmath181 the free fermi response strongly differs with data only in the longitudinal case . @xmath182",
    "a very simple model , which uses the ring approximation with a @xmath152  +  @xmath153 plus the landau - migdal @xmath183-interaction gives a good adjustment for the position and height of the transverse peak .",
    "the conjunction of these elements certainly shows the transverse channel as more understandable .",
    "however , a word of caution should be given : this simple model provides no intensity in the dip region and when all possible mechanisms ( mesons exchange currents , initial and final state interactions , etc . )",
    "are incorporated , the resulting response shows a tendency to overestimate data .",
    "our model is more complex than the ring series with the @xmath183+@xmath152  +  @xmath153-interaction .",
    "but it is simpler than the more elaborate ones for the transverse channel already mentioned .",
    "these points suggest that it is precisely the transverse channel the most difficult to be understood .    as a final comment",
    ", we would like to stress that the many - body problem in inclusive quasi - elastic electron scattering is quite involved .",
    "any result is strongly dependent on the nuclear interaction , which is full of unknown coupling constants and parameters .",
    "recent improvements ( see for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , show that we are closer to the solution of the puzzle , which necessarily implies a complex many - body calculation together with an adequate election of the nuclear interaction . in any case",
    ", the simultaneous study of several momentum transfers should be given . in this sense , we think that the present contribution is a step further in this direction . clearly , our next objective is the inclusion of ground state correlations and meson exchange currents in order to analyze the transverse channel .",
