    "radiative nonleptonic kaon decays represent a source of information on the structure of the weak interactions at low energies , and provide crucial tests of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the current paper presents new results related to study of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 decays by the na48/2 experiment at the cern sps .",
    "the flavour - changing neutral current process @xmath3 , induced at one - loop level in the standard model and highly suppressed by the gim mechanism , has been described by the chpt@xcite ; several models predicting the form factor characterizing the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the decay rate have been proposed@xcite .",
    "the decay is fairly well explored experimentally : it was first studied at cern@xcite , followed by bnl e777@xcite and e865@xcite measurements .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays similarly arise at one - loop level in the chpt .",
    "the decay rates and spectra have been computed at leading and next - to - leading orders@xcite , and strongly depend on a single theoretically unknown parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental knowledge of these processes is rather poor : before the na48/2 experiment , only a single observation of 31 @xmath1 candidates was made@xcite , while the @xmath5 decay was not observed at all .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1 ,",
    "a description of the na48/2 experiment is given .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a rather detailed description of the @xmath0 analysis and its preliminary results , which is the main topic of the paper .",
    "section 3 briefly presents the preliminary results of the @xmath1 analysis ; a more detailed discussion is reserved for the moriond qcd 2008 conference . section 4 briefly presents the final results of the @xmath2 analysis , which have recently been published@xcite . finally the conclusions follow .",
    "the na48/2 experiment , designed to excel in charge asymmetry measurements@xcite , is based on simultaneous @xmath6 and @xmath7 beams produced by 400 gev/@xmath8 primary sps protons impinging at zero incidence angle on a beryllium target of 40 cm length and 2 mm diameter .",
    "charged particles with momentum @xmath9 gev/@xmath8 are selected by an achromatic system of four dipole magnets with zero total deflection ( ` achromat ' ) , which splits the two beams in the vertical plane and then recombines them on a common axis .",
    "then the beams pass through a defining collimator and a series of four quadrupoles designed to produce focusing of the beams towards the detector .",
    "finally the two beams are again split in the vertical plane and recombined in a second achromat .",
    "the layout of the beams and detectors is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "the beams then enter the decay volume housed in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank with a diameter of 1.92 m for the first 65 m , and 2.4 m for the rest .",
    "both beams follow the same path in the decay volume : their axes coincide within 1  mm , while the transverse size of the beams is about 1  cm . with @xmath10 protons incident on the target per sps spill of @xmath11  s duration , the positive ( negative ) beam flux at the entrance of the decay volume is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) particles per pulse , of which @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 flux ratio is about @xmath17 .",
    "the fraction of beam kaons decaying in the decay volume at nominal momentum is @xmath18 .",
    "the decay volume is followed by a magnetic spectrometer housed in a tank filled with helium at nearly atmospheric pressure , separated from the vacuum tank by a thin ( @xmath19 ) kevlar composite window .",
    "a thin - walled aluminium beam pipe of 16  cm outer diameter traversing the centre of the spectrometer ( and all the following detectors ) allows the undecayed beam particles and the muon halo from decays of beam pions to continue their path in vacuum .",
    "the spectrometer consists of four drift chambers ( dch ) : dch1 , dch2 located upstream , and dch3 , dch4 downstream of a dipole magnet .",
    "the magnet provides a horizontal transverse momentum kick @xmath20 for charged particles .",
    "the dchs have the shape of a regular octagon with a transverse size of about 2.8 m and a fiducial area of about 4.5 m@xmath21 .",
    "each chamber is composed of eight planes of sense wires arranged in four pairs of staggered planes oriented horizontally , vertically , and along each of the two orthogonal @xmath22 directions .",
    "the spatial resolution of each dch is @xmath23 m .",
    "the nominal spectrometer momentum resolution is @xmath24 ( @xmath25 in gev/@xmath8 ) .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer is followed by a plastic scintillator hodoscope ( hod ) used to produce fast trigger signals and to provide precise time measurements of charged particles .",
    "the hodoscope has a regular octagonal shape with a transverse size of about 2.4  m. it consists of a plane of horizontal and a plane of vertical strip - shaped counters .",
    "each plane consists of 64 counters arranged in four quadrants .",
    "counter widths ( lengths ) vary from 6.5 cm ( 121 cm ) for central counters to 9.9 cm ( 60 cm ) for peripheral ones .",
    "the hod is followed by a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr)@xcite used for photon detection and particle identification .",
    "it is an almost homogeneous ionization chamber with an active volume of 7 m@xmath26 of liquid krypton , segmented transversally into 13248 projective cells , 2@xmath272 cm@xmath21 each , by a system of cu@xmath29be ribbon electrodes , and with no longitudinal segmentation .",
    "the calorimeter is @xmath30 deep and has an energy resolution @xmath31 ( @xmath32 in gev ) . spatial resolution for a single electromagnetic shower is @xmath33 cm for the transverse coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the lkr is followed by a hadronic calorimeter ( hac ) and a muon detector ( muv ) , both not used in the present analysis",
    ". a detailed description of the components of the na48 detector can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the na48/2 experiment took data during two runs in 2003 and 2004 , with about 60 days of effective running each .",
    "about @xmath36 events were recorded in total .    in order to simulate the detector response ,",
    "a detailed geant - based@xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is employed , which includes full detector geometry and material description , stray magnetic fields , dch local inefficiencies and misalignment , detailed simulation of the kaon beam line , and time variations of the above throughout the running period .",
    "radiative corrections are applied to kaon decays using the photos package@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 rate is measured relatively to the abundant @xmath37 normalization channel ( with @xmath38 ) .",
    "the final states of the signal and normalization channels contain identical sets of charged particles .",
    "thus electron and pion identification efficiencies , potentially representing a significant source of systematic uncertainties , cancel in the first order .",
    "three - track vertices ( compatible with the topology of @xmath0 and @xmath37 decays ) are reconstructed using the kalman filter algorithm@xcite by extrapolation of track segments from the upstream part of the spectrometer back into the decay volume , taking into account the measured earth s magnetic field , stray field due to magnetization of the vacuum tank , and multiple scattering in the kevlar window .",
    "a large part of the selection is common to the signal and normalization modes .",
    "it requires a presence of a vertex satisfying the following criteria .    *",
    "total charge of the three tracks : @xmath39 . *",
    "vertex longitudinal position is inside fiducial decay volume : @xmath40 . *",
    "particle identification is performed using the ratio @xmath41 of track energy deposition in the lkr to its momentum measured by the spectrometer .",
    "the vertex is required to be composed of one pion candidate ( @xmath42 ) , and two opposite charge @xmath43 candidates ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "no discrimination of pions against muons is performed . *",
    "the vertex tracks are required to be consistent in time ( within a 10  ns time window ) and consistent with the trigger time , to be in dch , lkr and hod geometric acceptance , and to have momenta in the range @xmath45 .",
    "track separations are required to exceed 2  cm in the dch1 plane to suppress photon conversions , and to exceed 15  cm in the lkr plane to minimize particle misidentification due to shower overlaps .",
    "if multiple vertices satisfying the above conditions are found , the one with the best fit quality is considered .",

    "are found in the signal region .",
    "after the kinematical suppression of the @xmath64 decays , residual background contamination mostly results from particle misidentification ( i.e. @xmath43 identified as @xmath65 and vice versa ) .",
    "the following relevant background sources were identified with mc simulations : ( 1 ) @xmath37 with misidentified @xmath43 and @xmath65 ; ( 2 ) @xmath66 with a misidentified @xmath43 from the @xmath64 decay .",

    "both @xmath0 and @xmath37 samples ( as well as @xmath73 ) are recorded via the same two - level trigger chain . at the first level ( l1 ) , a coincidence of hits in the two planes of the hod in at least two of the 16 non - overlapping segments is required . the second level ( l2 )",
    "is based on a hardware system computing coordinates of hits from dch drift times , and a farm of asynchronous processors performing fast track reconstruction and running a selection algorithm , which basically requires at least two tracks to originate in the decay volume with the closest distance of approach of less than 5 cm .",
    "l1 triggers not satisfying this condition are examined further and accepted nevertheless if there is a reconstructed track not kinematically compatible with a @xmath74 decay of a @xmath75 having momentum of 60 gev/@xmath8 directed along the beam axis .",
    "the na48/2 analysis strategy for non - rare decay modes involves direct measurement of the trigger efficiencies using control data samples of downscaled low bias triggers collected simultaneously with the main triggers",
    ". however direct measurements are not possible for the @xmath0 events due to very limited sizes of the corresponding control samples .",
    "dedicated simulations of l1 and l2 performance ( involving , in particular , the measured time dependencies of local dch and hod inefficiencies ) were used instead . the simulated efficiencies and their kinematic dependencies were compared against measurements for the abundant @xmath37 and @xmath76 decays in order to validate the simulations .",
