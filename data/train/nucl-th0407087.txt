    "the cornerstone of traditional nuclear physics is the study of nuclear forces and , over the years , phenomenological forms of the nuclear potential have become increasingly sophisticated . in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 )",
    "system , where data abound , the present state of the art is indicated , for example , by phenomenological potentials such as av18 that are able to fit phase shifts in the energy region from threshold to 350 mev in terms of @xmath8 40 parameters .",
    "progress has been made in the description of few - nucleon systems @xcite , but such a purely phenomenological approach is less efficient in dealing with the components of the nuclear interaction that are not constrained by @xmath1 data . at the same time , in recent years a new technique effective field theory ( eft) has been used in order to attack this problem by exploiting the symmetries of qcd @xcite . in this approach",
    "the nuclear interaction is separated into long- and short - distance components . in its original formulation @xcite , designed for processes with typical momenta comparable to the pion mass , @xmath9 , the long - distance component is described fully quantum mechanically in terms of pion exchange , while the short - distance piece is described in terms of a number of phenomenologically - determined contact couplings .",
    "the resulting potential @xcite is approaching @xcite the degree of accuracy of purely - phenomenological potentials .",
    "even higher precision can be achieved at lower momenta , where all interactions can be taken as short ranged , as has been demonstrated not only in the @xmath1 system @xcite , but also in the three - nucleon system @xcite .",
    "precise ( @xmath10 ) values have been generated also for low - energy , astro - physically - important cross sections of reactions such as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "besides providing reliable values for such quantities , the use of eft techniques allows for a realistic estimation of the size of possible corrections .    over the past nearly half century",
    "there has also developed a series of measurements attempting to illuminate the parity-_violating _ ( pv ) nuclear interaction .",
    "indeed the first experimental paper was that of tanner in 1957 @xcite , shortly after the experimental confirmation of parity violation in nuclear beta decay by wu et al .",
    "@xcite . following the seminal theoretical work by michel in 1964 @xcite and that of other authors in the late 1960 s @xcite , the results of such experiments have generally been analyzed in terms of a meson - exchange picture , and in 1980 the work of desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) developed a comprehensive and general meson - exchange framework for the analysis of such interactions in terms of seven parameters representing weak parity - violating meson - nucleon couplings @xcite .",
    "the ddh interaction has become the standard setting by which hadronic and nuclear pv processes are now analyzed theoretically .",
    "it is important to observe , however , that the ddh framework is , at heart , a _ model _ based on a meson - exchange picture .",
    "provided one is interested primarily in near - threshold phenomena , use of a model is unnecessary , and one can instead represent the pv nuclear interaction in a model - independent effective - field - theoretic fashion .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to formulate such a systematic , model - independent treatment of pv @xmath1 interactions .",
    "we feel that this is a timely goal , since such pv interactions are interesting not only in their own right but also as effects entering atomic pv measurements @xcite as well as experiments that use parity violation in electromagnetic interactions to probe nucleon structure @xcite .",
    "in our reformulation of nuclear pv , we consider two versions of eft , one in which the pions have been integrated out \" and the other including the pion as an explicit degree of freedom . in the pionless theory ,",
    "the pv nuclear interaction is entirely short - ranged , and the most general potential depends at leading order on five independent operators parameterized by a set of five _ a priori _ unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) . when applied to low - energy ( @xmath12 mev ) two - nucleon pv observables such as the neutron spin asymmetry in the capture reaction @xmath13 it implies that there are five independent pv amplitudes , which may be determined by an appropriate set of measurements .",
    "we therefore recover previous results obtained without effective field theory by danilov @xcite and desplanques and missimer @xcite .",
    "making contact with these known results is an important motivation for us to consider this pionless eft .",
    "going beyond this , in next ( non - vanishing ) order in the eft , there are several additional independent operators .",
    "by contrast , the ddh meson - exchange framework amounts to a model in which the short - range physics is codified into six independent operators . on one hand ,",
    "the heavy - meson component of the ddh potential is a redundant representation of the leading - order eft . on the other",
    ", it does not provide the most complete parameterization of the short - ranged pv @xmath1 force to subleading order , because it is based on a truncation of the qcd spectrum after inclusion of the lowest - lying octet of vector mesons .",
    "it may , therefore , not be entirely physically realistic , and we feel that a more general treatment using eft is warranted .",
    "when we are interested in observables at higher energies , we need to account for pion propagation explicitly , simultaneously removing its effects from the contact interactions .",
    "inclusion of explicit pions introduces a long - range component into the pv @xmath1 interaction , whose strength is set at the lowest order by the pv @xmath2 yukawa coupling , @xmath14 .",
    "this long - range component , which is formally of lower - order than shorter - range interactions , is identical to the long - range , one - pion - exchange ( ope ) component of the ddh potential .",
    "however , in addition , inclusion of pions leads to several new effects that do not arise explicitly in the ddh picture :    * a medium - range , two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) component in the potential that arises at the same order as the leading short - range potential and that is also proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this medium - range component was considered some time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite but could not be systematically incorporated into the treatment of nuclear pv until the advent of eft . as a result",
    ", such piece has not been previously included in the analysis of pv observables .",
    "we find that the two - pion terms introduce a qualitatively new aspect into the problem and speculate that their inclusion may modify the @xmath14 sensitivity of various pv observables .",
    "* next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) pv @xmath2 operators . in principle , there exist several such operators that contribute to the pv nn interaction at the same order as the leading short - range potential . in practice ,",
    "however , effects of all but one of the independent nnlo pv @xmath2 operators can be absorbed via a suitable redefinition of the short - range operator coefficients and @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficient of the remaining , independent nnlo operator ",
    "@xmath15  must be determined from experiment .",
    "additional terms are generated in the potential at @xmath16 by higher - order corrections to the strong @xmath2 coupling ( here , @xmath17 denotes a small momentum or pion mass ) .",
    "these terms have also not been included in previous treatments of the pv @xmath1 interaction .",
    "their coefficients are fixed by either reparameterization invariance or measurements of other parity - conserving pion - nucleon observables . * a new electromagnetic operator . for pv observables involving photons ,",
    "the explicit incorporation of pions requires inclusion of a pv @xmath18 operator that is entirely absent from the ddh framework and whose strength is characterized by a constant @xmath19 .    in short , for the low - energy processes of interest here ,",
    "the most general eft treatment of pv observables depends in practice on eight _ a priori _ unknown constants when the pion is included as an explicit degree of freedom : five independent combinations of @xmath16 short - range constants and those associated with the effects of the pion : @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and the nnlo pv @xmath2 coupling @xmath15 . in order to determine these pv low - energy constants ( lecs ) ,",
    "one therefore requires a minimum of five independent , low - energy observables for the pionless eft and eight for the eft with dynamical pions . given the theoretical ambiguities associated with interpreting many - body nuclear observables ( see below ) , one would ideally attempt to determine the pv lecs from measurements in few - body systems .",
    "indeed , the state of the art in few - body physics allows one perform _",
    "ab initio _ computations of few - body observables @xcite , thereby making the few - body system a theoretically clean environment in which to study the effects of hadronic pv .",
    "at present , however , there exist only two measurements of few - body pv observables : @xmath20 , the longitudinal analyzing power in polarized proton - proton scattering , and @xmath21 , the longitudinal analyzing power for @xmath22 scattering . in",
    "what follows , we outline a prospective program of additional measurements that would afford a complete determination of the pv lecs through @xmath16 .",
    "completion of this low - energy program would serve two additional purposes .",
    "first , it would provide hadron structure theorists with a set of benchmark numbers that are in principle calculable from first principles .",
    "this situation would be analogous to what one encounters in chiral perturbation theory for pseudoscalar mesons , where the experimental determination of the ten lecs appearing in the @xmath23 lagrangian presents a challenge to hadron - structure theory . while many of the @xmath23 lecs are saturated by @xmath24-channel exchange of vector mesons",
    ", it is not clear _ a priori _ that the analogous pv @xmath1 constants are similarly saturated ( as is assumed implicitly in the ddh model ) .",
    "moreover , analysis of the pv @xmath1 lecs involves the interplay of weak and strong interactions in the strangeness - conserving sector .",
    "a similar situation occurs in @xmath25 hadronic weak interactions , and the interplay of strong and weak interactions in this case is both subtle and only partially understood , as evidenced , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the well - known @xmath26 rule enigma .",
    "the additional information in the @xmath27 sector provided by a well - defined set of experimental numbers would undoubtedly shed light on this fundamental problem .",
    "the information derived from the low - energy few - nucleon pv program could also provide a starting point for a reanalysis of pv effects in many - body systems . until now",
    ", one has attempted to use pv observables obtained from both few- and many - body systems in order to determine the seven pv meson - nucleon couplings entering the ddh potential , and several inconsistencies have emerged .",
    "the most blatant is the vastly different value for @xmath14 obtained from the pv @xmath28-decays of @xmath29f and from the combination of the @xmath30 asymmetry and the cesium anapole moment .",
    "although combinations of coupling constants can be found that fit partial sets of experiments ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it seems difficult to describe all experiments consistently with theory ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the origin of this clash could be due to any one of a number of factors .",
    "using the operator constraints derived from the few - body program as input into the nuclear analysis could help clarify the situation .",
    "it may be , for example , that the medium - range tpe potential or higher - order operators relevant only to nuclear pv processes play a more significant role in nuclei than implicitly assumed by the ddh framework .",
    "alternatively , the treatment of the many - body system such as the truncation of the model space in shell - model approaches to the cesium anapole moment may be the culprit .",
    "( for an example of the relevance of nucleon - nucleon correlations to parity violation in nuclei , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in any case , approaching the nuclear problem from a more systematic perspective and drawing upon the results of few - body studies would undoubtedly represent an advance for the field .    in the remainder of the paper , then , we describe in detail the eft reformulation of nuclear pv and the corresponding program of study . in section [ sec2a ] , we briefly review the conventional , ddh analysis and summarize the key differences with the eft approach .",
    "in particular , we write down the various components of the pv eft potential here , relegating its derivation to subsequent sections . in section",
    "[ fewbody ] , we outline the phenomenology of the low - energy few - body pv program , providing illustrative relationships between various observables and the five relevant , independent combinations of short - range lecs .",
    "we emphasize that the analysis presented in section [ fewbody ] is intended to demonstrate _ how _ one would go about carrying out the few - body program rather than to give precise numerical formulas . obtaining",
    "the latter will require more sophisticated few - body calculations than we are able to undertake here .",
    "section [ pionless ] contains the derivation of the pv potential in the eft without explicit pions .",
    "we then extend the framework to include pions explicitly in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ models ]",
    "we discuss the relationship between the pv lecs and the pv meson - nucleon couplings entering the ddh framework , and illustrate how this relationship depends on one s truncation of the qcd spectrum .",
    "section [ sec9 ] contains some final observations .",
    "various details pertaining to the calculations contained in the text appear in the appendices .",
    "the essential idea behind the conventional ddh framework relies on the fairly successful representation of the parity - conserving @xmath1 interaction in terms of a single meson - exchange approach .",
    "of course , this requires the use of strong - interaction couplings of the lightest vector ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath33 ) mesons(@xmath34 ) , @xmath35 whose values are reasonably well determined .",
    "the ddh approach to the parity - violating weak interaction utilizes a similar meson - exchange picture , but now with one strong and one weak vertex _cf .",
    "[ fig : ddh ] .    we require then a parity - violating @xmath36 hamiltonian in analogy to eq . (",
    "[ eq : pch ] ) .",
    "the process is simplified somewhat by barton s theorem , which requires that in the cp - conserving limit , which we employ , exchange of neutral pseudoscalars is forbidden @xcite . from general arguments , the effective hamiltonian with fewest derivatives must take the form @xmath37 we see that there exist , in this model , seven unknown weak couplings @xmath14 , @xmath38 , ... however , quark model calculations suggest that @xmath39 is quite small @xcite , so this term is usually omitted , leaving parity - violating observables described in terms of just six constants .",
    "ddh attempted to evaluate such pv couplings using basic quark - model and symmetry techniques , but they encountered significant theoretical uncertainties . for this reason",
    "their results were presented in terms of an allowable range for each , accompanied by a `` best value '' representing their best guess for each coupling .",

    "in summary , we have performed a systematic study of the parity - nonconserving nucleon - nucleon potential , and have suggested ways by which the present confused experimental situation can be resolved .",
    "we have proposed breaking this program into two separate pieces :    * since the low - energy parity - violating potential involves five s - p wave mixing amplitudes , we have constructed a simple local effective potential in order to reliably extract such quantities from experiments involving only the @xmath1 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 systems .",
    "we have also suggested the critical experiments that are needed in order to successfully complete this task and have given explicit formulas which will express the mixing amplitudes in terms of experimental observables .",
    "we have also suggested a two - phase experimental program , where phase one would include six ( or possibly seven ) measurements needed to test the consistency of the pionless eft and phase two would involve additional measurements needed to determine the pion - related parameters if necessitated by the results of phase one . *",
    "a second important facet of this program is to confront the extracted phenomenological potential with theoretical expectations . for this task ,",
    "we have systematically constructed a parity - violating nucleon - nucleon potential @xmath43 within the framework of effective field theory using the weinberg counting scheme up to the order @xmath16 .",
    "the correspondence with , and difference from , the conventional ddh potential were discussed .    in order for this scheme to come to fruition additional work is required on several fronts .",
    "experimentally it is critical to complete the key experiments , resulting in a confirmed and reliable set of low - energy phenomenological parameters . once these parameters are known , it is important to use them in order to analyze the heavier nuclear systems and resolve the various existing conflicts .",
    "doing so could have important implications for the applicability of eft to other electroweak processes in heavy nuclei , such as neutrinoless double @xmath44-decay@xcite .",
    "future work is also needed to understand the relation between the underlying effective weak potential @xmath43 and the effective phenomenological parameters @xmath45 and should involve the best available nuclear wave functions .",
    "what should result from this program is the resolution of the presently confusing experimental situation and a reliable form for the parity - violating nuclear potential , which we hope will set the standard for future work in this field .",

    "since we employ the heavy - fermion formalism , one can build the most general pv operators by using heavy - baryon fields directly .",

    "if we had started from the non - relativistic theory and tried to write the most general effective lagrangian , we would have naively identified each of these three structures as being independent and would have mistakenly postulated three , rather than two , lecs .",
    "the requirements imposed on the independence of various non - relativistic operators which follow from consistency with the relativistic theory is known as reparameterization invariance .",
    "physically , this invariance amounts to stating that the non - relativistic theory should not contain more physics ( _ e.g. _ , lecs ) than the relativistic one .",
    "analogous situations occur in heavy - quark eft and in the non - relativistic expansion of the nucleon kinetic operator in heavy - nucleon eft .",
