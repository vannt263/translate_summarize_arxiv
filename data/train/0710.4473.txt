    "the casimir effect @xcite is a paradigm for fluctuation - induced phenomena .",
    "casimir forces between mesoscopic or even macroscopic objects which result from fluctuations of the ubiquitous radiation field or of the charge distribution on the objects inspire many branches of physics , ranging from mathematical to applied physics , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "since fluctuations usually occur on all momentum or length scales , they encode both local as well as global properties of a given system . in the case of the casimir effect ,",
    "the resulting force is influenced by localized properties of the involved objects such as surface roughness as well as by the global geometry of a given configuration . from a technical perspective , localized properties",
    "can often be taken into account by perturbative methods owing to a separation of scales : e.g. , the corrugation wavelength and amplitude are usually much smaller than the object s separation distance .",
    "but global properties such as geometry or curvature dependencies generally require a full understanding of the fluctuation spectrum in a given configuration .",
    "recent years have witnessed the development of a variety of new field - theoretical methods for understanding and computing fluctuation phenomena .",
    "so far , only phenomenological recipes had early been developed for more complex casimir geometries , such as the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite .",
    "for the special case of casimir forces between compact objects , field - theoretic results in asymptotic limits had been worked out @xcite .",
    "a first field - theoretic study of the experimentally important configuration of a sphere above a plate @xcite was performed in @xcite based on a semiclassical expansion .",
    "a constrained functional - integral approach , as first introduced in @xcite for the parallel - plate case , was further developed for corrugated surfaces in @xcite .",
    "the sphere - plate as well as cylinder - plate configuration @xcite was also used as a first example for the worldline approach to the casimir effect @xcite , which is based on a mapping of field - theoretic fluctuation averages onto quantum - mechanical path integrals .",
    "this technique is rooted in the string - inspired approach to quantum field theory which is particularly powerful for the computation of amplitudes and effective actions in background fields @xcite . for arbitrary backgrounds , the path integral over the worldlines representing the spacetime trajectories of the quantum fluctuations",
    "can straightforwardly be computed by monte carlo methods , as first demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the particular advantage of the approach arises from the fact that the computational algorithm can be formulated independently of the background .",
    "this makes the approach so valuable for casimir problems , where a given surface geometry constitutes the background for the fluctuations .",
    "the resulting technical simplifications become particularly transparent for fluctuations obeying dirichlet boundary conditions ( b.c . ) , where high - precision computations have been performed , e.g. , for the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate case @xcite .",
    "a number of further first - principles approaches for arbitrary casimir geometries have been developed and successfully applied in recent years .",
    "the constraint functional - integral approach has been extended to general dispersive forces between deformed media @xcite .",
    "in particular , approaches based on scattering theory have proved most successful , starting with an exact study of the sphere - plate configuration with dirichlet b.c .",
    "scattering theory also lead to a solution for the cylinder - plate case which , as a waveguide configuration , allowed for a study of the case with real electromagnetic b.c .",
    "these scattering tools have been further developed to facilitate an analytical computation of the important small - curvature expansion @xcite . for configurations with compact objects , new scattering formulations",
    "have recently been found which separate the problem into the scattering off the single objects on the one hand and a propagation of the fluctuation information between the objects on the other hand @xcite ; in particular , electromagnetic b.c .  for real materials",
    "can conveniently be addressed with a new formulation which emphasizes the charge fluctuations on the surfaces @xcite .",
    "let us also mention the combination of scattering theory with a perturbative expansion that has recently allowed to study geometry effects beyond the pfa @xcite .",
    "scattering theory is also a valuable tool for analyzing casimir self - energies @xcite .",
    "finally , direct mode summation has also successfully been applied to nontrivial geometries @xcite .    in a real casimir experiment",
    ", further properties such as finite conductivity , surface roughness and finite temperature have to be accounted for in addition to the geometry .",
    "generically , these corrections do not factorize but reveal a nontrivial interplay .",
    "for instance , the interplay between dielectric material properties and finite temperature @xcite still seems insufficiently understood and has lead to a long - standing controversy @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the ideal casimir effect where this controversy does not exists ; but even in the ideal limit , the interplay between geometry and temperature can be substantial , as demonstrated below .",
    "the difference is not only of quantitative nature , but arises from the underlying spectral properties of the fluctuations , as first pointed out by jaffe and scardicchio @xcite . in the familiar parallel - plate case ,",
    "the nontrivial part of the spectrum transverse to the plates exhibits a gap of wave number @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the plate separation . at temperatures",
    "@xmath2 smaller than this gap , the relevant fluctuation modes are hardly excited , implying a suppression of the thermal corrections ; the leading small - temperature contribution to the parallel - plates casimir force scales like @xmath3 .",
    "geometries with a gap in the relevant part of the excitation spectrum are called closed . following the same line of argument",
    ", we expect a suppression for thermal effects for all closed geometries .",
    "by contrast , there is no reason for this strong suppression of thermal corrections in open geometries which do not have a gap in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the sphere - plate or cylinder - plate cases belong to this class . for open geometries ,",
    "there are always casimir - relevant modes in the fluctuation spectrum that can be excited at any small value of the temperature .",
    "hence , we expect a much stronger dependence on the temperature , e.g. , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , and thus a potentially much stronger thermal contribution in the experimentally relevant parameter range @xmath6 .",
    "so far , no first - principle calculation has been able to confirm this expectation , since generic asymptotic - limit considerations and standard approximations typically break down in the relevant parameter range , as already emphasized in @xcite . for instance , the exact solution for the cylinder - plate case allowed for an explicit temperature study of the limit of small cylinder radius , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . in this limit",
    ", a log - modified @xmath3 correction is obtained for the dominant part of the spectrum with dirichlet b.c .",
    "this result suggests that the low - lying thermal excitations with long wavelength are not suppressed by a gap but by the smallness of the cylinder radius required by the asymptotic - limit considerations .",
    "also , the use of recipes such as the pfa can lead to a different scaling , such as a @xmath9 law for the sphere - plate case @xcite . whereas the pfa at zero temperature is justifiable in the low - curvature limit , @xmath10 , @xcite",
    ", pfa - deduced thermal corrections can be problematic : at small temperatures with thermal wavelength much larger than the minimal surface separation @xmath11 , the thermal excitations can be more sensitive to the curvature radius than the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "even worse , the pfa uses the parallel - plate formula , and hence a gapped spectrum , as an input and thus misses the important difference arising from an open geometry .    in this work ,",
    "we present first evidence for a strong thermal correction to a casimir force law for an open geometry using worldline numerics .",
    "as a paradigmatic example , we use the configuration of a semi - infinite half - plate perpendicularly above an infinite plate ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : sketches ] ) , imposing dirichlet b.c .  for the fluctuations of a real scalar field .",
    "this configuration belongs to a set of cases , revealing a universal force law determined by dimensionality , which has first been investigated in the context of casimir edge effects @xcite .",
    "since the configuration has only one length scale which is the distance @xmath1 between the edge of the half - plate and the infinite plate , the interplay of the gapless fluctuation spectrum with thermal excitations is not disturbed by other length scales , resulting in a clean thermal signature of an open geometry .",
    "our worldline calculations yield a thermal correction obeying an @xmath9 force law at low temperature .",
    "this implies a substantial increase of the thermal contribution compared to those for a closed geometry .",
    "the fact that geometry and temperature exhibit such a nontrivial interplay in casimir systems , resulting in `` geothermal '' casimir phenomena , is another peculiar feature that should be added to the long list of peculiarities of the casimir effect ; it clearly deserves further investigation .",
    "let us briefly summarize the worldline approach to the casimir effect .",
    "more detailed descriptions and derivations from first principles can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider the casimir interaction energy , serving as a potential energy for the force , for two rigid objects with surfaces @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for a massless scalar field with dirichlet boundaries in @xmath14 , the worldline representation of the casimir interaction energy",
    "is given by @xmath15 \\right\\rangle .",
    "\\label{eq : ecasw}\\ ] ] here , the worldline functional @xmath16=1 $ ] if the path @xmath17 intersects the surface @xmath18 in both parts @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath16=0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "this compact formula has an intuitive interpretation : the worldlines can be viewed as the spacetime trajectories of the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field .",
    "any worldline that intersects the surfaces does not satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "all worldlines that intersect both surfaces thus should be removed from the ensemble of allowed fluctuations , thereby contributing to the negative casimir interaction energy .",
    "the auxiliary integration parameter @xmath19 , the so - called propertime , effectively governs the extent of a worldline in spacetime .",
    "large @xmath19 correspond to ir fluctuations with large worldlines , small @xmath19 to uv fluctuations .    the expectation value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecasw ] ) has to be taken with respect to the ensemble of worldlines that obeys a gauian velocity distribution @xmath20 where the worldlines have a common center of mass @xmath21 . at zero temperature , the time component of the worldlines cancels out for static objects , hence the straightforward monte carlo computation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ecasw ] ) and ( [ eq : expval ] ) can be restricted to the spatial part .",
    "finite temperature can now easily be implemented with the aid of the matsubara formalism , and also the technical changes of the numerical algorithm are only minor : the euclidean time , say along the @xmath22th direction , is compactified to the interval @xmath23 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the worldlines can also wind around the time dimension , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketches ] .",
    "it is convenient to write a given loop @xmath24 with winding number @xmath25 as sum of a loop with no winding , @xmath26 , and a translation in time running from zero to @xmath27 with constant speed , @xmath28 the path integral over the different winding number sectors labeled by @xmath25 factorizes for static configurations , yielding @xmath29 the worldline representation of the casimir interaction energy for the dirichlet scalar at finite temperature thus reads @xmath30 \\right\\rangle .",
    "\\label{eq : etemp}\\ ] ] whereas the worldline expectation value remains identical to the one at zero temperature , the winding sum re - weights the propertime integrand : larger temperature emphasizes smaller propertimes and vice versa .",
    "this confirms the expectation that thermal corrections at low temperature are dominated by long wavelength fluctuations which in our case correspond to worldlines with a large spatial extent .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath31 is normalized such that @xmath32 for infinite distances @xmath33 .",
    "hence , @xmath31 can differ from the thermodynamic free energy by thermal corrections to the self - energies of the single surfaces .",
    "the latter is distance - independent and thus does not contribute to the casimir force .      as a test ,",
    "let us consider the two parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath1 along the @xmath34  axis .",
    "interchanging expectation value and @xmath35 integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : etemp ] ) , we encounter @xmath36      =      ( \\sqrt{\\mathcal",
    "t } l - a)\\ , \\theta ( \\sqrt{\\mathcal t } l -a ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes the dimensionless extent of the given worldline in @xmath34  direction measured in units of @xmath38 ; cf .",
    "differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq : etemp ] ) by @xmath39 yields the casimir force @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ( infinite ) area of the plates .     and at zero temperature",
    "is plotted versus the temperature in units of the plate distance @xmath1 .",
    "the rectangle at low temperature marks the region magnified in fig .",
    "[ fig : smalltemperature ] . for the worldline numerical result",
    ", we have employed 800 loops each with @xmath42 points . ]",
    "figure [ fig : temperature ] shows the numerical result for the casimir interaction energy ( [ eq : pp ] ) , corresponding to the distant - dependent part of the free energy , normalized to the zero - temperature result . for comparison , the analytic result , @xmath43,\\ ] ] is also shown , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "both results agree satisfactorily .",
    "incidentally , the leading thermal correction can be obtained analytically from the worldline representation ( [ eq : pp ] ) : for @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 ) , the propertime integrand is dominated by large @xmath46 , hence the lower bound can safely be set to zero .",
    "this results in the well - known leading thermal correction @xmath47 , which can also be understood as an excluded volume effect : thermal modes are excluded from the region between the two plates which thus does not contribute to the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "we now consider the perpendicular - plate configuration introduced above .",

    "figure [ fig : smalltemperature ] compares the resulting temperature correction with that of the parallel - plates case in the small temperature range of fig .",

    "the temperature effect for the parallel plates is @xmath58 .",
    "the open geometry therefore exhibits a thermal correction which is an order of magnitude larger than the closed parallel - plates case .",
    "the leading thermal correction can again be computed analytically from the worldline representation ( [ eq : perpp ] ) by extending the lower bound of the @xmath46 integral to 0 and using @xmath59 . here",

    "we obtain @xmath60 which is confirmed by the full numerical result over the whole range of temperatures shown in fig .",

    "we note that the low - temperature scaling of the thermal correction for this open geometry can not be understood as an excluded - volume effect .",
    "we have presented analytical as well as numerical results for the nontrivial interplay between geometry and finite temperature for the casimir effect in open geometries . for the first time",

    ".  confirms our analytically derived @xmath9 force law at low temperatures .",
    "this should be compared to the weaker @xmath3 dependence of the parallel - plates case where a gap in the spectrum suppresses the thermal correction .",
