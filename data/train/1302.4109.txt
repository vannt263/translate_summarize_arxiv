    "in the last years , seminal experimental setups have been developed combining a very good decoupling of the quantum systems from their environment with a high degree of controllability of the system s parameters .",
    "this renders the observation of the temporal evolution of closed quantum systems for long times possible . switching the internal parameters provides tools to investigate systems out of equilibrium . in optical lattices ,",
    "the internal parameters such as hopping and particle - particle interaction can be manipulated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various pumb - probe experiments based on ultrafast spectroscopy @xcite have been developed @xcite .",
    "these developments have triggered extensive theoretical studies of physics far from equilibrium , based on a large variety of analytical and numerical tools @xcite .",
    "the goal is to qualitatively understand and to quantitatively describe the dynamics of quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "how do such states evolve ?",
    "do they relax towards equilibrium ?",
    "how does this happen and on which time scales ?",
    "these issues are relevant in all dimensions .",
    "but so far the infinite dimensional and the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case have attracted the greatest interest .",
    "mainly , this is due to the possibility of approximation - free results in both cases .",
    "the infinite dimensional case ( @xmath0 ) is amenable by dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite for which it is exact , also in the non - equilibrium case @xcite .",
    "the 1d case is amenable to analytical ( e.g.  bosonization @xcite ) and numerical ( e.g. time - dependent density - matrix renormalization @xcite ) approaches .",
    "in addition , there is a fascinating conceptual issue inherent to 1d systems : all extended non - trivial _",
    "integrable _ quantum systems are 1d and the existence of an exhaustive number of conserved quantities influences the dynamics strongly because it implies a macroscopic number of conserved quantitities @xcite .",
    "still , relaxation in local quantities due to dephasing may occur @xcite .",
    "one efficient way to realize states far from equilibrium are interaction quenches @xcite .",
    "the interaction value is changed abruptly increasing it @xcite or decreasing it @xcite .",
    "we focus on interactions which are suddenly switched on with fermi seas as initial states .",
    "this simplifies the evaluation because all correlations are known analytically , but it is not essential for the applicability of our approach which is based on extended equations of motion @xcite .    for an understanding of the dynamics of quenched systems also the behavior on short and moderate times directly after the quench matters .",
    "relaxation , if it happens , may set in directly or coherent oscillations may take place before relaxation occurs on a longer time scale .",
    "the occurrence of intermediate time scales , on which the system does not yet reflect the long - time behavior , is subsumed under the term `` prethermalization '' @xcite .",
    "these issues are particularly difficult to study in strongly correlated systems .",
    "interestingly , evaluating the dmft equations after interaction quenches of the half - filled system two regimes occurred @xcite which are characterized by qualitative differences in the time dependence of the jump @xmath1 in the momentum distribution at the fermi level . for small values of the interaction",
    "@xmath2 , this quantity decreases gradually from its initial value of unity corresponding to the non - interacting fermi sea and a prethermalization plateau can be discerned . for large values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the jump @xmath1 is characterized by strong oscillations .",
    "the key difference is that @xmath1 displays zeros in the strong - interaction regime while they are absent for weak interaction .",
    "this observation of two qualitatively different dynamics could be retrieved in a variational gutzwiller approach , evaluated in gutzwiller approximation , by schir and fabrizio @xcite .",
    "their treatment maps the quantum dynamics to a classical mechanics problem .",
    "true relaxation , however , is neglected in this way .",
    "but the resulting equations allow for an analytic evaluation .",
    "the oscillatory regime for weak quenches and the one for strong quenches are separated by a singularity indicating a dynamical transition .",
    "note that the gutzwiller approximation becomes exact for infinite coordination number @xcite so that the similarity between the dmft and the gutzwiller results may not suprise .    in view of these results , it is our goal to show that a hubbard model with completely different properties displays essentially the same dynamical transition .",
    "thus we study the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "it is different from the hubbard model examined by dmft and gutzwiller techniques in two important aspects : ( i ) scattering between the excitations is controlled by momentum conservation in 1d @xcite while momentum conservation is suppressed at internal vertices in large dimensions @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the macroscopic number of conserved quantities in the integrable 1d hubbard model @xcite should constrain the non - equilibrium dynamics so that it differs significantly from what is seen in higher dimensions .",
    "yet we find that the dynamical transition is also present in 1d with even quantitative similarities .",
    "the article is set up as follows .",
    "next , the model , the quench , and our approach to them are introduced . in sect .",
    "iii , the results for the time - dependent jump in the momentum distribution are presented . in sect .",
    "iv , we analyse the data with respect to the occurrence of a dynamical transition . finally , conclusions are drawn in sect .  v.",
    "for the quench , we start from a fermi sea and switch on the interaction abruptly . thus the hubbard hamiltonian becomes time - dependent and reads @xmath3 with a local repulsion @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) create ( annihilate ) a particle with spin @xmath7 at site @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we study @xmath10 and define the band width @xmath11 as the natural energy scale .",
    "the approach used is a systematically controlled expansion of the heisenberg equations of motion for @xmath12 @xcite . by commuting the interacting @xmath13 after the quench recursively with @xmath12 , i.e. , by applying the liouvillian",
    ", we obtain differential equations for the prefactors of the expansion of @xmath14 in more and more monomials of @xmath15 and @xmath6 at @xmath16 .",
    "we perform this calculation in real space .",
    "the application of one commutation is a ` loop ' .",
    "roughly , each loop multiplies the number of tracked monomials by a factor 3 .",
    "we are able to realize up to 11 loops . in fig .",
    "[ fig : varu ] the convergence of time - dependent results with the loop number is shown .",
    "our approach bears similarities to recent calculations based on recursively constructed hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "but we stress that our approach is operator - oriented .",
    "the evaluation of expectation values is done only at the end at the time instant of interest .",
    "the evaluation of the differential equations on the one - loop level describes the time dependence of the initial operator @xmath12 exactly in linear order in @xmath17 . by each loop",
    "we increment the depth of the hierarchy of the equations of motions by one and thus the time dependence of the initial operator @xmath12 is precisely captured up to order @xmath18 for @xmath19 loops .",
    "finally , we solve the differential equations numerically so that also higher powers of @xmath17 are generated .",
    "the conceptual asset of the approach is that it works directly on the infinite lattice by exploiting translational invariance .",

    "the scattering in 1d is strongly restricted due to momentum conservation @xcite while this conservation is irrelevant at internal vertices in dmft @xcite .",

    "for @xmath29 quantitative differences prevail beyond @xmath30 so that it is difficult to discern qualitative similarities .",

    "result @xmath32 ( @xmath19 filling factor ) is included in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmft ] .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations , however , differ significantly .",
    "we conclude that the periods of the oscillations are a candidate for similarities while the amplitudes and their decay are more strongly depending on the model . in 1d",
    ", a slow power law relaxation is generic while exponential relaxation is expected in higher dimensions in agreement with the dmft data .",
    "these striking similarities indicate that for large @xmath2 the physics is governed by local processes as is explained below .",
    "we return to the oscillations @xmath33 which appear both for strong quenches and for weak quenches .",

    "away from half - filling , the logarithmic singularity in is smeared out .    what does our data yield for the oscillation periods ?",
    "in absence of relaxation , thus without changes in the oscillatory amplitudes , it is straightforward to read off the period @xmath34 . in our data",
    ", this is less obvious . to determine the period @xmath34 we fit a straight line to the data such that it is a double tangent to two points close to the first two minima , see inset of fig .",

    "half - filling ( @xmath42 ) and for interaction values @xmath2 smaller than about @xmath43 the oscillation period @xmath34 hardly depends on @xmath2 .",
    "the rather flat curve in this regime is in agreement with the semiclassical finding for half - filling although the value of @xmath34 differs roughly by a factor of two which may not surprise in view of the very different models .",

    "the coefficients follow the differential equations    @xmath49    for the coefficients .",
    "this result covers the leading order in @xmath17 independent of the value of @xmath2 because the commutation of the interaction part in with the local operators , i.e , those at site 0 , in does not yield any other operator term than those that we included . in this sense , the approach used becomes exact for @xmath46 .",
    "the surrounding lattice sites act as damping bath .    at",
    "half - filling , the above differential equations can be solved analytically and we find for the oscillation period @xmath50 . for finite doping the numerical solution is easily done . in both cases , @xmath47 is the leading order result in an expansion in @xmath51 .",
    "the equations of motion approach is well - controlled for large values of @xmath2 because the number of operators generated by commutation with the interaction part does not grow infinitely .",
    "their number is finite for a fixed number of sites involved because the corresponding hilbert space is finite .",
    "the subleading order @xmath52 is exactly captured if all operators acting on two sites are included which happens in the seven - loop calculation . clearly , local processes dominate for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "returning to the two regimes of quenches , we stress that only the oscillations at half - filling display zeros in @xmath1 after the _ strong _ quenches . for any finite doping ( @xmath53 ) the oscillations persist , but do not reach zero any more in their minima as shown in detail in fig .",

    "nevertheless , our finding is suggestive of a singular behavior which may be a jump ( indicated by a dashed line ) or a logarithmic singularity ( the periods rise by about a factor two above their @xmath58 value ) .",
    "the similarity to the semiclassical result is surprising and indicates that indeed the two regimes of quenches are separated by a dynamical transition .",
    "the small shift of the position of the anomaly from @xmath59 to @xmath60 is of minor importance .     as function of @xmath2 ( @xmath61 in 1d ) ; @xmath19 denotes the total filling factor per site .",
    "the dotted curve depicts the semiclassical gutzwiller result @xcite .",
    "[ fig : period ] ]    we emphasize that all oscillations after strong quenches , to the right of the dashed part of the half - filled curve , display zeros @xmath1 while no zeros are found for weak quenches , to the left of the dashed part .",
    "this holds , however , only at half - filling . for finite doping",
    ", even strong quenches do not imply zeros so that the transition ceases to exist for any doping , see fig .",
    "[ fig : doping ] .",
    "thus the data constitutes very strong evidence for a qualitative , dynamical transition between both regimes at half - filling . at finite doping , it appears to be washed out immediately .",
    "the anomaly , however , disappears gradually : we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] that about 20% of doping are required to make the anomaly vanish completely , cf .  app .",
    "[ sec_osc ]",
    ".    the finding agrees with the semiclassical , relaxation - free gutzwiller result in infinite dimensions @xcite and with the available dmft data @xcite .",
    "since such similar behavior occurs in extreme cases such as a one - dimensional integrable model with important momentum conservation and an infinite dimensional model with suppressed momentum conservation the conclusion suggests itself that the dynamical transition is a general feature in quenched , half - filled hubbard models .",
    "summarizing , we studied interaction quenches in the one - dimensional hubbard model by an approach based on equations of motion .",
    "it is systematically controlled in the depth of the hierarchy ; here up to 11 commutations were carried out .",

    "two qualitatively different regimes appear : for strong quenches , the jumps display zeros , for weak quenches they do not . in the dependence of the oscillation period @xmath34 on the interaction @xmath2 a clear anomaly appears separating both regimes .",
    "it indicates a dynamical transition .",
    "since this scenario is in surprising agreement with previous findings in infinite - dimensional models @xcite we suggest that this scenario holds for half - filled hubbbard models in general .",

    "we acknowledge support by the studienstiftung des deutschen volkes ( sah ) and by the mercator stiftung ( gsu ) .",
    "we are interested in momentum distributions after interaction quenches",
    ". they can be computed by fourier transformation of the one - particle equal time propagators @xmath62 where the expectation value is taken with respect to the noninteracting fermi sea @xmath63 which represents the initial state before the quench .",
    "the @xmath64 stands for a site on the lattice under study , here a chain in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "the time - dependent operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are represented by the following ansatz @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) denote various superpositions of particle ( hole ) creation operators . for instance , the single particle creation @xmath68 is given by @xmath70 with time - dependent prefactors @xmath71 .",
    "the shifts @xmath72 can be bounded from above by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the maximal velocity in the sense of the lieb - robinson theorem @xcite .",
    "physically , this means that there is a maximum velocity with which the essential effects of the hamiltonian after the quench can travel .",
    "of course , exponentially small effects will be neglected .",
    "hence , in order to describe the dynamics correctly up a certain time one has to include processes up to a certain spatial range @xcite . this idea is also used in other approaches @xcite .    to calculate the time dependence of the prefactors we use the heisenberg equation",

    "@xmath77 $ ] we encounter two cases .",
    "the commutation of the noninteracting part of the hamiltonian @xmath78 leads to a shift of the fermionic operators in space , whereas the commutation with the interaction term @xmath79 may additionally create or annihilate particle - hole pairs @xmath80 .",
    "iterating this process then leads to the ansatz . with each commutation",
    "more terms with higher number of particles involved are created .",
    "thus the amount of terms grows exponentially : at 11 loops we deal with up to @xmath81 monomials in the hubbard model and a set of differential equations with about @xmath82 terms on the right hand side .",
    "the differential equations of the prefactors can be solved numerically with the initial conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84. because each commutation comprises one order in time @xmath17 a calculation with @xmath19 commutations provides results for @xmath85 which are exact up to order @xmath86 .",
    "we stress , however , that we do not use a series expansion in @xmath17 but solve the ( truncated ) set of differential equations numerically .    due to the proliferating number of additional terms arising within the calculation we have to restrict ourselves to a finite number of commutations . as terms appearing during the last commutation for the first time lead to an overestimation of the weight loss for the one particle terms ,",
    "we omit them to improve the convergence . a calculation with @xmath87 commutations performed in this way",
