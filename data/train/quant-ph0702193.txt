    "ever since the first generation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , it has been a central task to study quantum properties of such degenerate gases .",
    "surprisingly , it turned out that many properties are well explained by the gross - pitaevskii equation , which is a an effective nonlinear single - particle equation and allows to calculate the evolution of the average atomic density and phase .",
    "the density can be observed by simple absorption images after expansion , and the phase can be mapped onto density modulations in interferometric setups .",
    "the limited validity of such mean - field descriptions became apparent with the advent of optical lattices @xcite , where one has quantum phase transitions between states of similar average density but radically different quantum fluctuations .",
    "the majority of methods to characterize quantum properties of degenerate gases are based on matter - wave interference between atoms released from a trap in time - of - flight measurements @xcite , which destroys the system .",
    "recently , a method of `` bragg spectroscopy '' based on stimulated scattering of matter waves by laser pulses was applied to homogeneous becs @xcite and atoms in lattices @xcite . in this case , the measured quantities ( e.g. structure factor ) , which carry information about density fluctuations , are also accessible via matter - wave interference .",
    "although the scattered light and stimulated matter waves can be entangled and mutually carry the statistical information @xcite , the laser fields are simply considered as a tool to stimulate matter waves .",
    "in contrast to those works , the nondestructive methods based on measurements of light fields only , without destroying atoms , were proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for homogeneous becs in traps and optical lattices @xcite . here",
    "the average amplitude of the scattered light is solely determined by the average atomic density , while the photon number and other higher order field expectation values contain quantum statistical properties of atoms .    in this paper",
    ", we show that this is of even greater significance for atoms in lattices , where different quantum phases show qualitatively distinct light scattering . here",
    "we extend the preliminary results presented in our previous letter , ref .",
    "in particular , linear scattering can create entangled states of light and manybody atomic states , exhibiting a nontrivial connection of the field amplitude and intensity . as a practical consequence ,",
    "we demonstrate the possibility to distinguish between different quantum phases , e.g. , mott insulator ( mi ) and superfluid ( sf ) , by measuring properties of a scattered off - resonant beam .",
    "this possibility is exhibited in several different ways involving simple intensity measurements , or more involved measurements of quadrature variances , photon statistics , as well as phase - sensitive or spectral measurements .",
    "a careful analysis of the scattered light provides information about global statistics ( related to atom number at a lattice region illuminated by the probe ) , local quantities ( reflecting statistics at a single site even without an optical single - site access ) , and pair correlations between different sites .",
    "note that we consider off - resonant and almost nondestructive light scattering , corresponding to the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements of various atom - number functions . in principle , it can be repeatedly or even continuously applied to the same sample .",
    "this is very different from noise spectroscopy in absorption images @xcite where observations of quantum fluctuations of the atomic density were recently reported .    for homogeneous becs @xcite",
    ", the scattered light was shown to consist of two contributions : the strong classical part insensitive to atomic fluctuations , and weaker one , which carries information about atom statistics . for a large atom number ,",
    "the classical part completely dominates the second one , which , in some papers , even led to a conclusion about the impossibility of distinguishing between different atomic states by intensity measurements , and , hence , to a necessity to measure photon statistics .    in our work",
    ", we show that light scattering from atoms in optical lattices has essentially different and advantageous characteristics in contrast to scattering from homogeneous becs .",
    "for example , the problem of suppressing the strong classical part of scattering has a natural solution : in the directions of classical diffraction minima , the expectation value of the light amplitude is zero , while the intensity ( photon number ) is nonzero and therefore directly reflects density fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , in an optical lattice , the signal is sensitive not only to the periodic density distribution , but also to the periodic distribution of density fluctuations , giving an access to even very small nonlocal pair correlations , which is possible by measuring light in the directions of diffraction maxima .    as free space light scattering from a small sample",
    "can be weak , it might be selectively enhanced by a cavity . the corresponding light scattering from an optical lattice exhibits a complicated angle dependence and narrow angle - resolved features appear at angles , where classical diffraction can not exist . in experiments ,",
    "such a nontrivial angle dependence can help in the separation between the signal reflecting atom statistics from a technical noise .",
    "joining the paradigms of two broad fields of quantum physics , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and ultracold gases , will enable new investigations of both light and matter at ultimate quantum levels , which only recently became experimentally possible  @xcite . here",
    "we predict effects accessible in such novel setups .    experimentally ,",
    "diffraction ( bragg scattering ) of light from classical atoms in optical lattices was considered , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our work , we are essentially focused on the properties of scattering from ultracold lattice atoms with quantized center - of - mass motion .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a general theoretical model of light scattering from atoms in an optical lattice is developed taking into account atom tunneling between neighboring sites . in sec .",
    "iii , we significantly reduce the model to the case of a deep lattice and give a classical analogy of light diffraction on a quantum lattice .",
    "section  iv presents a relation between atom statistics and different characteristics of scattered light : intensity and amplitude , quadratures , photon statistics , and phase - sensitive and spectral characteristics .",

    "for the coherent state , the light scattered into a diffraction maximum displays a very strong noise ( equal to @xmath262 because @xmath263 and @xmath264 ) , which is much stronger than the isotropic component ( @xmath227 in highest order of @xmath172 ) and the features at @xmath265 ( @xmath266 in highest order of @xmath172 ) [ fig .

    "the nontrivial angle dependence of the noise can help in the separation of the light noise reflecting atom statistics from technical imperfections .",
    "we studied off - resonant collective light scattering from ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice . measuring the light field",
    "allows to characterize the quantum state of atoms in a nondestructive way and in particular distinguish between different atomic states .",
    "the scattered light differs in intensity , quadrature variances , and photon statistics .",
    "a measurement of the intensity angular distribution provides information about atom number fluctuations in a finite lattice region , local quantum statistics at single sites , and pair correlations .",
    "note that even local statistics can be determined by global measurements without an optical access to particular sites . alternatively to angle - resolved measurements , variations of the mode wavelengths with respect to the wavelength of a trapping beam can be considered .",
    "light scattering as a diagnostic tool has particular advantages for optical lattices in contrast to scattering from a homogeneous bec .",
    "here one has a natural way to suppress the strong classical scattering background by looking at the directions of diffraction minima . in these directions the expectation value of the field amplitude vanishes while the intensity ( photon number ) is nonzero and directly reflects quantum fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , in an optical lattice , the signal is sensitive not only to the periodic density distribution , but also to the periodic density fluctuations , giving an access to even very small nonlocal pair correlations .",
    "these can be obtained by measuring light at diffraction maxima .",
    "as the most striking example , we considered light scattering from a 1d lattice in a transversally pumped optical cavity as in a setup involving collective cavity cooling @xcite . the number of photons scattered into the cavity is zero for the mott insulator phase but proportional to the atom number in the superfluid phase .",
    "both states have almost the same average density but different quantum uncertainties .",
    "so the superfluid state is a quantum superposition of different fock states corresponding to all possible distributions of @xmath2 atoms at @xmath3 sites . under illumination by a coherent light",
    ", various fock states become entangled to scattered light states with different amplitudes and phases . in contrast to classical scattering , where the atoms are described by c - number center - of - mass positions @xcite , for a quantum description of the atomic motion the light field amplitudes corresponding to different atomic distributions do not interfere .",
    "this is due to the orthogonality of fock states forming the superfluid providing a sort of which way information .    in the example",
    "configuration , the cavity - field amplitude is determined by the atom number operators @xmath268 .",
    "hence , the expectation value of the field amplitude is sensitive to the average density only .",
    "in contrast , the intracavity photon number reflects the second moments of atom number operators ( e.g. density - density correlations ) , while photon statistics reflects the forth moments .",
    "let s emphasize that other physical systems are possible , where the light amplitude depends on the matter - field amplitudes @xmath39 , while the intensity is sensitive to density operators @xmath67 .",
    "the latter situation is typical to configurations , where two or more atomic subsystems exist and can interact with each other , in particular , through light fields .",
    "the examples are matter - wave superradiance and amplification , where two or more momentum states of cold atoms were observed @xcite , and interaction between two becs with different internal @xcite or motional @xcite atomic states . in the framework of our paper , matter - field amplitudes @xmath39 can also contribute to light amplitudes @xmath7 , if the tunneling between lattice sites is important , which we have considered in the general model in sec .",
    "ii . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "the lattice was assumed deep leading to negligible tunneling .    in general",
    ", a variety of optical effects can be sensitive to a quantum state of an ultracold matter , if the density operators enter measurable quantities nonlinearly , such that the expectation value of those quantities can not be simply expressed through expectation values of density operators .",
    "for instance , the @xmath269 nonlinearity @xcite and refractive index of a gas , where nonlocal field effects are important @xcite , were shown to depend on atom statistics . in this paper",
    ", we focused on such nonlinear quantities as intensity , quadrature variances , and photon statistics of scattered light @xcite .",
    "phase - sensitive and spectral characteristics mentioned in sec .",
    "iv.d reflect the dependence of the dispersion of a medium on the quantum state of matter @xcite .",
    "moreover , such dispersion effects ( e.g. cavity - mode shift ) will reflect atom statistics not only in light intensity , but even in light amplitudes @xmath270 .",
    "so far we have neglected the dynamic back action of scattered field on atoms .",
    "this can be well justified in a deep lattice where the momentum transfer is by far not enough to change the atomic vibrational state as long as not too many photons are scattered .",
    "even without energy transfer the information one gets from the light will induce measurement back - action .",
    "this should have intriguing consequences for multiple consecutive measurements on the light scattered from optical lattices .",
