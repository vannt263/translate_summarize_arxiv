    "open quantum systems are nowadays at the center of many research fields in physics , ranging from quantum computing to transport in nano- and meso - scale solid state systems as well as biological aggregates . in particular ,",
    "charge / excitation transport in the quantum coherent regime can be considered one of the central subjects in modern solid state physics  @xcite .",
    "transport properties depend strongly on the degree of openness of the system . in important applications ,",
    "the effect of the opening is large , and can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "the analysis of open quantum systems beyond the perturbative regime is often difficult due to the presence of infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , a consistent way to take the effect of the opening into account for arbitrary coupling strength between the system and the external world is highly desirable .    in a typical situation",
    ", we have a discrete quantum system coupled to an external environment characterized by a continuum of states .",
    "elimination of the continuum leads to an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "this approach to open quantum systems has been shown to be a very effective tool in dealing also with the strong coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian approach offers several advantages : ( i ) it reduces an infinite dimensional problem to a finite dimensional one ; ( ii ) it allows to compute conductance and the whole time - evolution of the relevant subsystem ; ( iii ) the effects of interference between discrete states and the continuum , such as superradiance or fano resonances can be easily analyzed  @xcite .",
    "tight - binding networks are often considered in literature to model quantum transport and decay , and their coupling with external environments , acting as sinks , is taken into account by adding non - hermitian terms to the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "indeed , non - hermitian models are more and more used to describe trapping or loss of excitation into transport channels of complex biological aggregates  @xcite , but a proper justification of the employed non - hermitian model is often overlooked .    together with the coupling to a sink , such networks are usually coupled to other environments , which induce different kinds of disorder : static disorder ( space - dependent ) and dynamical disorder ( time - dependent ) . when disorder is added to the system to take into account the effect of other environments , the strength of the coupling to the sink",
    "is usually assumed to be unaffected by the disorder itself .    this assumption has been used both when dealing with dynamical disorder  @xcite and with static disorder  @xcite .",
    "specifically , some of the authors of this paper have previously analyzed the interplay of opening and static disorder in paradigmatic models of quantum transport , such as one - dimensional and three - dimensional tight - binding models  @xcite .",
    "within the framework of the non - hermitian hamiltonian approach , it was found a novel cooperative regime characterized by the presence of subradiant hybrid states .",
    "moreover , cooperative robustness to disorder has been shown  @xcite to play an important role in the dynamics of quantum systems with sinks . as a matter of fact ,",
    "all of those results were obtained assuming the coupling to the sinks to be independent of the disorder strength , even if we expect this assumption to fail for large disorder .    in this paper",
    "we consider a tight - binding network composed by a ring - like structure coupled to a semi - infinite lead ( fig .  [ rl ] ) .",

    "we observe that the decomposition of the identity given above is correct only when the eigenstates of the hamiltonian form a complete set .",
    "this will be always true in the systems considered in this paper , but it is not always the case for non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "indeed , the breakdown of such a condition for parameter - dependent non - hermitian operators defines the so - called exceptional points in parameter space , whose study is relevant to many physical systems  @xcite .",

    "the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian , eq.s ( [ eq : heffe0],[q],[delta ] ) can be greatly simplified if the @xmath41-dependence can be neglected . in the case of a single quantum level of energy @xmath57 ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian becomes a complex number and we have @xmath58 in order to see under which conditions the @xmath41-dependence can be neglected we can analyze the expression for the evolution operator given in eq .  , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    ", can be well approximated around @xmath57 by setting @xmath64 with this approximation the evolution operator becomes @xmath65 clearly , the range of times in which the latter will be a good approximation for the actual evolution will depend on how well the propagator is approximated by a lorentzian function even for energies distant from @xmath57 .",
    "note that the approximated propagator implies an exponential decay of the unstable quantum state with a decay width @xmath66 see eq .",

    "when we have many levels coupled to the same continuum the evolution operator in a generic situation is given by eq .  .",
    "the problem of obtaining an energy - independent non - hermitian hamiltonian able to describe such evolution is now more delicate since , in this case , we may have different energies associated with the different levels .",
    "this general problem will be treated in a subsequent publication .    on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath67 and @xmath68 are smooth and slowly varying functions of @xmath41 in the whole physically relevant energy range , determined by the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the intrinsic system , we can completely neglect the dependence on the energy of the initial state . under these conditions",
    "we can obtain an energy - independent effective hamiltonian by setting @xmath69 where @xmath57 is any energy lying in the relevant range .",
    "we can thus treat also the case of many levels coupled to the same continuum with an energy - independent non - hermitian hamiltonian which reads : @xmath70 this approximation will be used in sec .",

    "the energy - independent non - hermitian hamiltonian behaves as an effective hamiltonian and allows us to compute the time evolution of the projection of the total wave function on the intrinsic system , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ut ] ) .",
    "indeed , we can expand any initial state of the intrinsic system , over the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian and its time evolution can be determined as follows : @xmath71    note that , for the case of a single particle / excitation in the intrinsic system and zero temperature in the external environment , the energy - independent non - hermitian hamiltonian description is equivalent to the standard master equation in lindblad form obtained under the born  markov  secular approximation  @xcite . nevertheless , the non - hermitian hamiltonian approach is computationally much more efficient because one has to integrate only @xmath2 equations while , with the master equation approach , one has @xmath72 equations to deal with .      a very important phenomenon that can be easily analyzed by means of the energy - independent effective hamiltonian , see eq .  ( [ eeh ] ) , is superradiance .",
    "it is the cooperative effect which produces a strong inhomogeneity in the decay rates of the states of the intrinsic subsystem : some states , named superradiant , display large decay rates , while the decay of some other states is very slow , sometimes even negligible .",
    "we note that such an effect is also known as `` resonance trapping '' and is present in many physical systems such as nuclei , microwave resonators , and optical resonators ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the roots of this effect lie in the interference due to the competition of different states of the intrinsic subsystem to decay in the same channel in the continuum . considering a generic situation ,",
    "let us assume that we can obtain an @xmath41-independent form of the terms @xmath73 and @xmath74 of eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "necessarily , the effective @xmath73 possesses a factorized structure , since it is derived by the tensor product of the ( rectangular ) transition matrices @xmath75 .",
    "it thus can have only as many non - zero eigenvalues as the number @xmath76 of decay channels . in the energy - independent approximation",

    "2 .   when @xmath78\\neq 0 $ ] , we encounter an additional effect , named superradiance transition .",
    "indeed , the relative energy scale of the opening term @xmath84 with respect to that of the intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath81 becomes important in determining how the decay width is distributed among the eigenstates of @xmath80 : when the opening is weak the eigenstates will be close to the eigenstates of @xmath81 and all of them will have a similar decay width ; on the other hand , when the opening is strong , the eigenstates will approach those of @xmath84 , and only @xmath76 of them will have a significant decay width .",
    "we then see a transition from a non - superradiant regime ( weak opening ) to a superradiant regime ( strong opening ) .",
    "this transition is not present in case 1 above , where we are in a superradiant regime for any opening strength .",
    "one could also consider the case @xmath77\\neq 0 $ ] , but under this condition it is not possible to predict the behavior of the system regarding superradiance on general grounds , and we need to look at the eigenvalues of the specific @xmath80 at hand .",

    "in particular it has been often considered in the frame of exciton transport in natural photosynthetic systems , where chlorophyll molecules aggregate in ring - like structures around a reaction center , representing a central core absorber , where the excitation can be trapped  @xcite .",
