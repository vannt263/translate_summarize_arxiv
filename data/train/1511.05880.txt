    "there is a unique relationship between the eos of cold dense matter and the sequence of compact star configurations in the mass - radius ( m - r ) diagram provided by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations .",
    "it can be used to quantify the likelihood of eos models by bayesian analyses using a selection of mass and/or radius measurements as priors @xcite . in this work",
    "we discuss a family of hybrid neutron stars described by an eos with a first - order phase transition that is obtained from a maxwell construction between hadronic and quark matter branches .",
    "our approach to the hybrid eos captures important physical features :    * excluded volume corrections in the hadronic eos , * multi - quark interactions for quark matter eos .",
    "the excluded volume corrections at the hadronic level take into account the inner structure of the nucleons which results in pauli blocking due to quark exchange interactions .",
    "this can be seen as a precursor of the quark delocalization which is the expected mechanism of the deconfinement transition @xcite that is still intensified by the simultaneous partial chiral restoration @xcite .",
    "the excluded volume modification is implemented for baryon densities exceeding saturation @xmath1 @xmath2 ( the density in the interior of atomic nuclei ) by considering the available volume @xmath3 for the motion of nucleons at a given density @xmath4 as defined in  @xcite    @xmath5~ , & \\textmd{if } & n > n_{\\textmd{sat}}~ ,                  \\end{array }                \\right .",

    "note that in the form ( [ vex ] ) assigning positive ( negative ) values for @xmath8 leads to a stiffening ( softening ) of the original eos for which we adopt dd2 @xcite with parameters from @xcite . here",
    ", we will consider only positive values of excluded volume and introduce for them the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 $ ] , varying it in the range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the multi - quark interactions as they were introduced by  @xcite and succesfully applied to massive hybrid star twins in  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that quark matter will still be strongly interacting at the energy densities present in neutron star interiors .",
    "those fall in the range where in lattice qcd simulations at finite temperatures the transition from hadronic to quark matter is obtained .",
    "therefore the introduction of the 8-quark vector channel interaction may be justified . in accordance with refs .",
    "@xcite , we denote the dimensionless coupling constant of this channel by @xmath12 and vary it in the range from @xmath10 to @xmath13 . increasing the value of this parameter",
    "has the effect of stiffening the eos at higher densities , which allows to support hybrid stars as massive as 2  m@xmath14 and thus fulfilling the constraint from recent observations @xcite , see fig .",

    "the results of our ba for the two cases defined above are shown in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : flowprs ] . for the case",
    "a , due to the constraint of a large radius , the stiffest possible eos among the accessible parameters was selected as the most probable hybrid star eos .",
    "in particular , largest values of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath12 that would correspond to hybrid star branches connected with hadronic ones , in the classification of @xcite . for case",
    "b , the high - mass twin star solution is preferred which corresponds to a disconnected hybrid star branch ( `` third family '' ) and disselects large values of the @xmath12 parameter .",
    "herewith we could demonstrate the usefulness of the bayesian analysis method . it allows to check the discriminating power of a certain experimental result before the actual measurement was made . in this sense the discovery potential of future programmes for compact star observations , like nicer or ska could be quantified .",
    "to test the interesting possibility that a strong first - order phase transition might occur in massive neutron stars of @xmath16 @xcite leading to the appearance of a `` third family '' of hybrid stars ( mass twins ) at this mass , one should perform radius measurements for these massive neutron stars @xcite .",
    "this possibility offers bright prospects for future observational campaigns and bears the chance to `` prove '' the existence of a critical point @xcite in the qcd phase diagram from astrophysics .",
