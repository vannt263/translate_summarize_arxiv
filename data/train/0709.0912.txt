    "previous studies have indicated that the frequency of disks is strongly dependent on the stellar mass , showing larger frequencies in the tts mass range ( spectral types k and m ) than in stars with higher masses @xcite .",
    "figure [ f : diskfrac ] also suggests that the disk frequency declines toward lower masses ( spectral types later than m1 ) showing a maximum around k7-m1 stars in agreement with results for the 2 - 3 myr cluster ic 348 by @xcite .",
    "however , given the degree of uncertainty in each individual point in figure [ f : diskfrac ] , caused by the small number of disk bearing stars in each spectral type bin , plus the observational bias introduced by the limiting magnitude in the mips photometry , this result is not conclusive and additional data is necessary to confirm this trend .    using figure [ f : slope ] , the frequencies calculated for stars with evolved disks related to the total number of stars bearing disks in the @xmath2 orionis cluster ( 15.6@xmath104.0 % ) , in ori ob1b ( 27.8@xmath1012.4 % ) and in 25 orionis ( 40@xmath1020% ) , indicate a clear trend toward more evolved disks in older stellar groups .",
    "the transitional disks candidates in these stellar groups are less frequent than evolved disks ( 8@xmath103% for the @xmath2 orionis cluster , 17@xmath1010 % for ob1b and 10@xmath1010% for 25 orionis ) , suggesting that the transitional disk phase is relatively fast or represents an independent and special stage in the disk clearing period of stars .",
    "disk frequencies of the sample members can be used to estimate the contamination level of non - members in the photometric candidates samples assuming that the photometric candidates bearing disks are actual members of young stellar groups .",
    "since the overall disk frequencies of low mass members ( 6.1 @xmath10 2.1 % ) and low mass photometric candidates ( 7.3 @xmath10 4.2 % ) in 25 orionis are similar , we can expect that photometric candidates sample have very low non - member contamination .",
    "since the disk frequency calculated in ob1b for the photometric candidates ( 6.2 @xmath10 3.1% ) is lower than the disk frequency of members ( 13.1 @xmath10 3.5 ) , we can expect that around 50% of the photometric candidates are not members of ob1b .      the frequency of stars bearing disks in different stellar groups is a function of age , indicating a time scale for disk dissipation in low mass stars of 5 - 7 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the top panel of figure [ fig : diskevol ] shows the median sed slope derived from the color [ 3.6]@xmath6[8.0 ] for disk bearing stars in stellar groups ranging in age from @xmath01 to @xmath010 myr : 1 - 2 myr ( taurus ; * ? ? ?",

    "error bars represent the quartiles given the median value for each stellar group .",
    "the median sed slope decreases with age , indicating a reduction of disk emission the inner regions of the disk . in the bottom panel , we display two sets of models described in  [ s : model ] with different disk orientations , i=30 @xmath23 ( dashed lines ) and i=60 @xmath23 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the accretion rate is a function of age @xcite , so we assumed m=10@xmath24 for 1 myr old stellar groups , which is the mode value for accreting stars in taurus @xcite and m=10@xmath25 for 10 myr old stellar groups , which is the mode value for accreting stars in the ob1a sub - association @xcite .",
    "this plot suggests that the expected decrease in accretion rate is not sufficient to explain the decrease of emission in the inner part of the disk , and it is necessary to increase the degree of settling ( @xmath19@xmath50.001 ) in the inner disk to explain the observed slopes in stellar groups with ages 5 myr or older .    since the disk frequency and the infrared disk emission decrease with age",
    ", a correlation between these values can be expected .",
    "figure [ fig : diskevol2 ] confirms this suggestion , showing that the disk frequency is correlated with the median sed slope in the irac bands ( correlation coefficient @xmath26=0.76 ) .",

    "we have used the irac and mips data from _ spitzer _ to study the disk frequencies and properties of disks around confirmed members of the orion ob1 association , 115 belonging to the @xmath27 myr old 25 orionis aggregate , and 106 in a region within the @xmath28 myr old ori ob1b sub association , near the orion belt star @xmath19 ori . using optical-2mass",
    "color magnitude diagrams 41 stars were selected as additional photometric candidates of the 25 orionis aggregate , and 65 as additional photometric candidates of the ori ob1b field .",
    "we use irac - mips diagrams to detect disk bearing stars , and to classify them as either having no detectable disk emission ( class iii ) , as systems with optically - thick disks ( class ii ) , or as objects in an intermediate phase between class ii and class iii systems .",
    "these intermediate type objects were further grouped in two categories : `` transitional disks candidates '' , which have an inner , optically thin disk region combined with an outer , optically thick disk ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and `` evolved disk objects '' , in which there is an overall decrease of emission both the inner and outer regions of the disk @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if  evolved disks  are a subsequent event after transitional disks phase , or represent an independent evolutionary stage .",
    "we found that the disk frequency in the 25 orionis aggregate ( 6 % ) and in the ori ob1b field ( 13 % ) is mass dependent , showing a maximum value for stars with spectral type m0 , and suggesting a decrease in the disk frequency toward higher and lower masses .",
    "the trend toward higher masses has been observed in several stellar groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the decrease in disk frequency toward lower masses is not conclusive , but is consistent with the results for other regions like ic 348 @xcite .",
    "we find that objects with evolved disks are more frequent in older stellar groups , while the transitional disk candidates represent a relative small fraction of the disk bearing stars in the various stellar groups , suggesting that the transitional disk phase is relatively fast .",
    "comparing the disk emission in the irac and mips bands for taurus , the @xmath2 orionis cluster , the ori ob1b field and the 25 orionis aggregate , we find that disk emission decreases faster in the innermost regions of the disk ; comparison with disk models from @xcite support this scenario .",
    "finally , comparing the disk emission in the irac spectral range of several stellar groups ranging in age from @xmath01 to @xmath012 myr , we find that inner disk emission decreases systematically with age , showing a correlation between disk frequencies and inner disk emission .",
    "comparison with models using a typical accretion rate for 1 and 10 myr suggests that viscous evolution alone is not sufficient to explain the decrease in the inner disk emission , and that large degrees of dust settling ( @xmath19 @xmath5 0.001 ) are necessary to explain the observed seds at ages 5 myr or older .",
