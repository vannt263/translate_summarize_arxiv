    "various models for nuclear structure have been developed in order to study low energy phenomena of the atomic nuclei .",
    "whereas straightforward application of the bare @xmath0 interaction is yet limited only to light nuclei  @xcite , the nuclear structure seems to be well described by relatively simple effective interactions at low energies .",
    "although the effective interactions may depend on the models , there should be basic characters in the effective interactions for the low energy phenomena , irrespective to the models .",
    "on the other hand , since the invention of the secondary beam technology , experimental data on the unstable nuclei have disclosed new aspects of the nuclear structure .",
    "a remarkable example is the dependence of magic numbers on the neutron excess  @xcite . in regard to the new magic numbers discovered near the neutron drip line",

    "mean - field theories have successfully been applied to the nuclear structure problems , in particular for stable nuclei .",
    "they are also useful to investigate basic characters of the effective interactions .",
    "however , not many effective interactions have been explored for the nuclear mean - field calculations so far .",
    "the skyrme interaction  @xcite has been popular in the hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations , since the zero - range form is easy to be handled . among a limited number of finite - range interactions ,",
    "the gogny interaction  @xcite is widely applied to the mean - field calculations , in which the gaussian form is assumed for the central force .",
    "the parameter - sets both of the skyrme and the gogny interactions have been adjusted mainly to the data on the nuclei around the @xmath1-stability . it is not obvious whether the available parameter - sets of these interactions account for the new magic numbers properly .    in order to exploit effective interactions applicable also to unstable nuclei , guide from microscopic theories will be important .",
    "brueckner s @xmath2-matrix has been a significant clue to studies in this course .",
    "although microscopic approaches using the @xmath2-matrix have not yet been successful in reproducing the saturation properties , notable progress has been made recently . in the shell",
    "model approaches , microscopic effective interactions have been shown to reproduce observed levels remarkably well  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the shell model interactions are usually specific to mass regions , and their global characters have not been discussed in detail , despite several exceptions  @xcite .",
    "the so - called michigan 3-range yukawa ( m3y ) interaction  @xcite has been derived from the bare @xmath0 interaction , by fitting the yukawa functions to the @xmath2-matrix . represented by the sum of the yukawa functions , the m3y - type interactions will be tractable in various models .",
    "it has been shown that the m3y interaction gives matrix elements similar to reliable shell model interactions  @xcite . moreover , with a certain modification , m3y - type interactions have successfully been applied to nuclear reactions  @xcite . by using a recently developed algorithm  @xcite ,",

    "@xcite , the skyrme and the gogny interactions are obtained by setting @xmath17 appropriately , except for some parameter - sets of the skyrme interaction in which certain terms are expressed only in the density - functional form .",
    "the saturation of density and energy is a basic property of nuclei . in developing effective interactions adaptable for many nuclei ,",
    "it is required to reproduce the saturation property .",
    "however , the non - relativistic @xmath2-matrix fails to reproduce the saturation at the right density and energy .",
    "therefore , it will not be appropriate to use the @xmath2-matrix for hf calculations without any modification , although several hf approaches using interactions derived from the @xmath2-matrix were tried in earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "the m3y interaction was obtained so that the @xmath2-matrix at a certain density could be reproduced by a sum of the yukawa functions .",
    "the m3y interaction gives no saturation point within the hf theory , unless density - dependence is taken into account explicitly .",

    "the exchange terms are treated approximately .",
    "however , the exchange terms may contribute quite significantly to the nuclear structure .",
    "we here keep the coupling constants in @xmath31 independent of density , while introduce a density - dependent contact interaction ( @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effint ] ) ) , as in the skyrme and the gogny interactions .",
    "we can then treat the exchange ( _ i.e. _ the fock ) terms exactly with the currently available computers .",
    "it should be mentioned that there has been an interesting attempt to approximate the exchange terms of the interaction in the density - matrix expansion  @xcite , although the accuracy of the density - matrix expansion should be checked carefully .",
    "we start from the paris - potential version of the m3y interaction  @xcite .",
    "this original parameter - set with no density - dependence is hereafter called ` m3y - p0 ' .",
    "we shall modify this interaction so as to reproduce the saturation properties . in the isotropic uniform nuclear matter ,",
    "matrix elements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 between the hf states vanish .",
    "therefore @xmath35 determines the bulk properties such as the saturation .",
    "the range parameters for the yukawa functions @xmath36 in @xmath31 are @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the m3y interaction , which correspond to the compton wave - lengths of mesons with masses of about 790 , 490 and 140mev , respectively .",
    "we do not change these parameters . for the longest - range part ( @xmath40 ) , the coupling constants @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fixed to be those of the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) , as in m3y - p0 .",
    "the interaction @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effint ] ) acts only on the se and te channels , @xmath45 microscopic investigations have shown that the density - dependence of the te part is primarily responsible for the saturation  @xcite , as a higher - order effect of the tensor force . while the interaction in the se channel is attractive at low densities , it also has certain density - dependence originating in the strong short - range repulsion .",
    "thus , a possible way of modifying the m3y interaction may be to replace a fraction of the repulsion in the se and te channels by @xmath32 .",
    "in addition to the saturation properties which are relevant to the central force , the ls splitting is significant in describing the shell structure of nuclei . while true origin of the ls splitting is not yet obvious  @xcite , ls splittings obtained from hf calculations with the @xmath2-matrix interaction are too small , in comparison with the observed ones . from the hf calculations for finite nuclei , we find that @xmath33 should be about twice as strong as that of m3y - p0 to reproduce the observed ls splittings .",
    "the tensor force influences the ordering of the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "orbits . to reproduce the observed ordering , @xmath34 should be smaller than that of m3y - p0 .",
    "we here introduce an overall enhancement factor to @xmath46 and an overall reduction factor to @xmath47 , as will be shown in section  [ sec : dmprop ] .    in this paper",
    "we shall use two parameter - sets for modified m3y interaction , ` m3y - p1 ' and ` m3y - p2 ' , in order to show sensitivity to the parameters for some results . in m3y - p1",

    "characters of m3y - p1 will be investigated in the nuclear matter .",
    "although this modification is too simple to reproduce properties of finite nuclei , the m3y - p1 set will be useful to clarify what characters arise from the original m3y interaction , relatively insensitive to the phenomenological modification . in the m3y - p2 set ,",
    "all @xmath20 parameters belonging to the @xmath48 and @xmath55 channels in @xmath31 are shifted from those of m3y - p0 .",
    "although we have three ranges in @xmath31 , the number of adjustable parameters is no greater than in the gogny interaction , since we fix the opep part .",
    "we fit those parameters , together with the enhancement factor for @xmath33 and the reduction factor for @xmath34 , to the binding energies of several doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the resultant values of the parameters will be shown later .",
    "basic characters of nuclear effective interactions can be discussed via properties of the infinite nuclear matter ; in particular , properties at and around the saturation point . in this section",
