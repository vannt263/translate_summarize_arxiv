    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , beginning with first light from first stars and ultra - faint galaxies , and ending with almost complete reionization of the primordial gas , marks an important period in the cosmic evolution of baryons @xcite .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty and limited observational constraints on the astrophysical evolution in this period , on the nature and spectral radiance of the first sources of light , and on the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) through the eor .    a strong constraint on the eor comes from detections of the gunn - peterson trough towards high - redshift qsos , which places the end of reionization at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution in the luminosity function of lyman-@xmath1 galaxies around this redshift supports this view and , additionally , indicates that the ionization fraction is 0.40.6 at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the planck detection in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) of low - multipole polarization together with anisotropy in the temperature places the average redshift of reionization @xmath3 between 7.8 and 8.8 .",
    "upper limits on the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect put an upper limit on the extent of the reionization epoch , of @xmath4 .",
    "these observational probes are either indirect in nature or present an integral measurement over time .",
    "on the other hand , the redshifted 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen is a direct probe of the state of the gas in the eor .",
    "wouthuysen - field @xcite coupling of the spin to kinetic temperature via lyman-@xmath1 photons , gas heating via x - rays and reionization via ultra - violet radiation generate spatial and temporal fluctuations in the 21-cm signal , all of which result in a redshifted 21-cm power spectrum whose monopole or all - sky global component traces the mean cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "although a direct detection of the 21-cm signal continues to be elusive , the paper radio interferometer derived lower limits in the range 510  @xmath5 on the igm temperature at @xmath6 based on upper limits to the power spectrum of 21-cm spatial fluctuations at that epoch ; the derived limit depends on the assumed ionization fraction @xcite . recently , additional upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum have been reported by mwa @xcite and lofar @xcite .",
    "while these experiments as well as hera and ska - low work towards detection of the 21-cm power spectrum , detection of the global 21-cm signal from the eor could well prepare the way with useful constrains on the mean evolution @xcite , given that a single - element radiometer suffices for a detection and the time required for achieving useful sensitivity , under ideal conditions , is only a few minutes .",
    "the present uncertainty in the astrophysical parameters during the eor allows for various possible global 21-cm signals , so well - calibrated wide - band radiometer measurements could enable us to pin down the underlying astrophysics @xcite .    a non - detection by the edges experiment , which targeted the global signal , placed a lower limit on the extent of reionization of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "analysis of such measurements up to @xmath81215 used to rely on theoretical predictions @xcite that reionization occurred in the `` saturated heating '' limit , in which cosmic heating had occurred earlier and the igm temperature no longer affected the 21-cm signal .",
    "however , @xcite showed that late heating , in which reionization features strong 21-cm absorption due to a still - cold igm , is quite plausible , opening up a wide variety of possible 21-cm signals .",
    "extrapolations of recent observations to high redshift also support such scenarios @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments are underway to detect the global 21-cm signal , including edges  2 @xcite , leda @xcite , bighorns @xcite , and sci - hi @xcite .",
    "attaining the necessary sensitivity to plausible signals is a formidable challenge : the cosmological signal needs to be discerned in the presence of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , instrumental systematics @xcite , and galactic and extra - galactic foregrounds , which can be 56 orders of magnitude brighter than the signal @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the foregrounds have been shown to be spectrally smooth to @xmath9 levels in the frequency range of 40200  mhz and can be modeled by smooth functions @xcite . however , the level of systematics is critically dependent on the radiometer design , calibration scheme , as well as data modeling strategies @xcite .",
    "saras 2 is a spectral radiometer that aims to detect the global 21-cm signal from the eor .",
    "below , we describe its design philosophy , calibration methodology , algorithms developed for rfi excision , and modeling of the foregrounds and instrumental systematics .",
    "we present results from first light upon deploying the system at a relatively radio quiet site at the timbaktu collective in southern india .",
    "saras  2 has a wide - band wide - field monopole antenna deployed on open level ground with receiver electronics enclosed in a unit below the antenna and below ground .",
    "the receiver is a correlation spectrometer in that the antenna signal is first split into two , then amplified separately in two parallel signal paths .",
    "the analog signals are transmitted on optical fiber to a signal processing unit located 100  m away , which is followed by a digital spectrometer that spectrally decomposes the signals , computes the complex cross - correlation between the signals and records the spectra .",
    "the entire system operates off batteries and can be deployed at remote radio - quiet sites .      the saras  2 antenna is a sphere - disc monopole antenna ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ant1 ] ) in which a circular aluminum disc on the ground is one element and a sphere atop an inverted cone forms the second element ; the sphere and cone are smoothly conjoined and the cone surface meets the sphere tangentially .",
    "the inner edge of a small circular hole at the center of the disc continues down as the outer conductor of a coaxial cable , whose central conductor connects to the apex of the cone .",
    "thus the antenna smoothly transforms into an unbalanced transmission line that connects to the receiver below without requiring any balun and without impedance transformers .",
    "the sphere radius is 0.146  m and the disk radius is 0.435  m. the structure is of simplistic design , defined by a minimal number of parameters , and electrically small , so that the performance is frequency independent and with smooth characteristics up to 250  mhz .",
    "the antenna beam is omnidirectional , with nulls towards the horizon and zenith , with a peak at @xmath10 elevation and half power beam width of @xmath11 .",
    "frequency independence of the beam is critical for this experiment in order to avoid coupling of sky structure into spectral features , and we have confirmed this property by range measurements and electromagnetic simulations .",
    "a radiation efficiency @xmath12 defines the frequency - dependent coupling of the beam - weighted sky temperature @xmath13 to the antenna .",
    "owing to impedance mismatch between the antenna and transmission line , only a fraction of this power  defined by a reflection efficiency @xmath14arrives at the receiver . the total efficiency @xmath15 determines the received antenna temperature : @xmath16 internal receiver noise appears as an additive contaminant in measured spectra , and internal reflections of the receiver noise at the antenna terminals result in spectral shapes for this contaminant , with the shape dependent on the antenna reflection coefficient @xmath17 , which is related to @xmath18 as : @xmath19 critical to detection of the eor global signal is designing @xmath20 to be spectrally smooth , meaning that there are no low level embedded ripples in the profile .",
    "mathematically , we require @xmath20 to be _ maximally smooth _",
    "field measurements of the antenna demonstrate that @xmath20 is spectrally smooth at 1 part in @xmath21 , ensuring that non - smooth systematics , if any , are below the sensitivity of the observations presented here .",
    "the total efficiency @xmath22 is estimated from a comparison of the differential antenna temperature measured as the sky drifts overhead and the expectation for this differential based on the gmoss model for the radio sky @xcite . this total efficiency and",
    "also the reflection efficiency are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ant2 ] ; the total efficiency represents the attenuation with which any eor signature would be present in observed spectra .",
    "it may be noted here that the efficiency is poor and more so at lower frequencies ; this was a design compromise made for saras  2 in that efficiency was sacrificed for spectral smoothness in the reflection efficiency and frequency independence of the beam",
    ".      the antenna signal is split coherently into two parallel paths , which are amplified separately .",
    "the splitter also adds coherent calibration noise into both paths ; however , the relative phases of the sky and calibration signals in the two paths differ by @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "the correlation spectrometer provides a difference measurement between the sky and calibration noise temperatures .    the configuration of the receiver is shown in fig .  [ fig : ant1 ] . a cross - over switch swaps the sky and calibration signals entering the splitter .",
    "differencing spectra recorded in the two positions of the switch cancels common - mode signals entering the two parallel signal paths . in each position of the cross - over switch",
    ", the calibration noise is switched on and off to provide data for bandpass calibration .",
    "system noise couples across the parallel paths via internal reflections at the antenna and components in the receiver chains to give an additive spurious component in the measurement .",
    "this is shaped by the frequency dependence of @xmath20 and the relative path delay with which the direct and reflected signals arrive at the correlation spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the saras  2 receiver is compact , mounted directly beneath and at the antenna terminals , and the components are interconnected thus avoiding transmission lines in - between .",
    "the amplified signals directly modulate lasers and transition to fibers , thus providing excellent optical isolation to the subsequent electronics located 100  m away .",
    "all of this helps ensure that the additive spurious component from internal reflections and multi - path propagation of system noise is spectrally smooth ; therefore , this unwanted component can also be modeled as a maximally smooth function .      located 100  m away from the antenna",
    "is a signal conditioning unit , which converts the signal back to electrical from optical and limits the band to 40250  mhz .",
    "this is followed by a well - shielded digital spectrometer , which samples the pair of signals in the parallel paths with 10-bit precision , computes 8192-point discrete fourier transforms , and measures the complex cross - correlation in each of 4096 frequency channels over the range 0250  mhz .",
    "the signals are windowed in the time domain using a blackman - nuttall window @xcite , to suppress leakage of any rfi into the rest of the band by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "saras  2 was deployed at the timbaktu collective ( latitude=+14242328 , longitude=77612606e ) .",
    "first light data was acquired over 4  hrs post - midnight on september 09/10 , 2016 .",
    "pre - processing and data calibration was performed within the miriad environment @xcite using custom tools .",
    "data were acquired cycling through each of four states : alternating the cross - over switch and toggling the calibration noise in each switch position .",
    "a batch of sixteen 67.1-ms integrated spectra were acquired in each state of the receiver . they were hampel filtered @xcite to reject strong rfi and then averaged .",
    "common - mode responses of the correlation spectrometer were rejected by differencing spectra corresponding to the two switch states ; this was followed by complex bandpass calibration .",
    "the calibrated spectra were processed using algorithms for detection / rejection of data corrupted by lower levels of rfi .",
    "spectra were fit with suitably high - order ( 10th order ) legendre polynomials over multiple overlapping bands , in order to fit out plausible models for the eor spectrum as well as foregrounds and instrumental systematics , and outliers in the residuals were detected using median filters and rejected .",
    "this was performed in successive iterations while progressively lowering the detection threshold and repeating the fits .",
    "data were also progressively averaged in frequency and time to detect faint rfi that may be present in contiguous channels and/or times .",
    "the algorithm was designed to avoid asymmetric clipping of noise peaks that may result in bias in averaged residuals at levels at which the eor signal is expected .",
    "the final stage is modeling the foreground plus systematics using a single smooth function as defined in @xcite , except that instead of using polynomial - form functions , we use cubic splines .",
    "the spectral band is subdivided into continuous segments and each segment is represented by cubic polynomials , with continuity at the boundaries in the values of the first and second derivatives .",
    "the global smoothness of the curve is guaranteed by disallowing zero crossings in its cubic - order terms across all segments .",
    "the cubic spline approximation is refined by progressively increasing the number of segments .",
    "this method guarantees a maximum of one zero crossing in the second derivative in the entire curve , which then represents a low - order approximation to the foregrounds plus systematics in the spectrum .",
    "this also inevitably results in a corresponding filtering out of a low - order component of any eor signature that may be present .",
    "long duration laboratory tests of the receiver were done with the antenna replaced by a variety of terminations : open , short and impedance matched terminations and a resistor  inductor  capacitor network with @xmath25 similar to that of the saras  2 antenna .",
    "all of these , on processing as above , yielded residuals consistent with thermal noise , with no evidence of residuals that may confuse an eor detection at the sensitivity of the first - light observations .",
    "processing of the first - light observations resulted in useful data in the 110200  mhz band ; this has been used below in deriving constraints on the eor .",
    "the final residuals , shown in fig .  [ fig : res ] , have root - mean - square noise of 32  mk .",
    "+   +     errors for the histogram . ]",
    "any eor signal appearing in the residual spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) would be attenuated by the total efficiency @xmath22 and  high - pass filtered \" in that the component of the attenuated signal that may be modeled as a smooth cubic spline would have been subtracted out by the data processing . corresponding to any plausible eor signal",
    "we may thus construct a  processed \" eor signal that is expected in the residual .    to test for the presence of any plausible eor signal in the residual , we compute the bayes factor ( see , for example , section  5 of @xcite ) , which is the ratio of likelihoods of the residual containing the processed signal plus expected gaussian noise ( the alternate hypothesis @xmath26 ) , and the likelihood of the residual containing just noise ( the null hypothesis @xmath27 ) .",
    "we assume both cases to be equally likely and hence assign uniform priors .",
    "the likelihoods are defined to be : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the data residual in the @xmath30 frequency channel , @xmath31 is the associated error , @xmath32 is the model amplitude at that channel and @xmath33 is the number of independent frequency channels .",
    "we derive the measurement noise @xmath31 by accounting for all of the data rejection for rfi , measurements of the system temperature , absolute calibration of saras  2 and finally from differences between adjacent channel data .",
    "the bayes factor @xmath34 is the ratio of the likelihood of @xmath35 being the processed signal to that for @xmath35 being zero .    to determine the significance of the bayes factor test corresponding to any particular eor signal template",
    ", we generate mock data with the same @xmath31 distribution as that in the data residuals .",
    "one dataset @xmath36 contains the processed eor template plus noise , while the second dataset @xmath37 contains only noise .",
    "we compute bayes factors for these mock datasets , to derive the distributions expected for the bayes factors .",
    "these distributions then yield the likelihoods for false positives and false negatives , when the bayes factor corresponding to any eor signal template exceeds unity or is below unity , respectively ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) .",
    "we compute bayes factors from the residual data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) for all of the global 21-cm templates predicted by the semi - numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "these templates correspond to various combinations of the astrophysical parameters spanning the entire range of plausible models given current observational constraints .",
    "we added more models that fill out the area of parameter space most sensitive to the global 21-cm data , and included some models whose 21-cm power spectrum lies above the 95% upper limit from paper @xcite , in order to compare the relative strengths of current global and fluctuation data .",
    "we also included models with various upper limits on the mean free path within ionized bubbles , due to absorption by lyman limit systems @xcite .",
    "for each possible model , we computed the bayes factor from the residual data , and also generated 1000 mock datasets @xmath36 and @xmath37 with independent noise realizations and derived the expected distributions for this bayes factor .",
    "the data was deemed as potentially able to significantly distinguish the signal only for those eor models for which the median of the bayes factor distribution for @xmath37 was so much lower than that of the @xmath36 distribution that the chance of obtaining a bayes factor that low ( or lower ) was below 32% .",
    "there were 21 such cases out of the total of 264 models considered here .",
    "there were no bayes factors exceeding unity , which implies that given the current sensitivity attained in the first - light observations , our data does not favor any model .",
    "for the just - mentioned 21 cases , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : temp2 ] the measured bayes factors along with the expected distributions of the bayes factors .",
    "the actual measured bayes factor is in all cases consistent with the @xmath37 ( no signal ) distribution and is close to its median .     to the @xmath38 percentile ) of the bayes factor distribution for datasets @xmath36 ( upper vertical column ) and @xmath37 ( lower vertical column ) .",

    "the columns are color coded according to the confidence with which they are rejected by the bayes factor test ( the false negative probability equals one minus the confidence level ) . ]    for the 21 models that are disfavored by the data , we computed the probability that the derived bayes factor is a false negative . in all these models",
    "the bayes factor test rejects the hypothesis @xmath26 and favors @xmath27 with confidence exceeding 68% or 1@xmath39 .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "the vertical lines delineate the band used in this work . ]",
    "the models that are disfavored by saras  2 all lie in the area of parameter space corresponding to late heating @xcite , actually a regime we might call very late heating , in which cosmic reionization ends without the global 21-cm signal having reached emission .",
    "this is essentially the same region currently ruled out by paper , but due to differences in redshift and other details , there is only partial overlap , and about half the models disfavored by saras  2 are rejected by paper .",
    "more specifically , saras  2 disfavors models that have late ( i.e. , weak ) x - ray heating and a rapid end to reionization ( due , for example , to large galaxies dominating star formation and a large mean free path available within the ionized bubbles ) .    in summary , we have identified a range of currently allowed models which first - light data from saras  2 is able to reject with fair confidence ranging from 96% down to 68% .",
    "these results are intriguing and we are collecting further data and eagerly await additional results .",
