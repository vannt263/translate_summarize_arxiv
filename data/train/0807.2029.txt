    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to be powered by massive black holes at the centers of galaxies , accreting gas from their surroundings .",
    "observations of agn show that they generally possess a high metallicity , varying from solar to supersolar metallicities @xcite .",
    "while the derived metallicities do depend on the detailed model assumptions , this appears to be a solid conclusion .",
    "gas metallicity is known to be strongly correlated with the stellar mass of the host galaxy @xcite . since agn",
    "are usually found in massive , bulge - dominated galaxies that have converted most of their gas into stars by the present epoch , their gas metallicities are generally high .",
    "a question then arises : do low - metallicity agn exist ?",
    "if so , can we find them in low - mass galaxies ? to address these questions ,",
    "@xcite have searched the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr4 ) spectroscopic galaxy sample of over 500,000 objects to select out @xmath5170,000 emission - line galaxies with high s / n spectra .",
    "they then use diagnostic line ratios to select out 23,000 seyfert 2s galaxies . imposing an upper mass limit of 10@xmath10 @xmath7 to restrict themselves to low - mass galaxies ,",
    "they are left with a sample of only @xmath5 40 agn , which they found appear to have metallicities around half that of typical agn , i.e. having solar or slightly subsolar values .",
    "the same high metallicity range is found in the sample of low - mass agn of @xcite . assessing their findings , @xcite",
    "are led to another question : `` why are there no agn with even lower metallicities ? '' in this paper , we suggest that these low - metallicity agn do exist although they are extremely rare . in the course of a long - range program to search for extremely metal - deficient emission - line dwarf galaxies , @xcite have used the sdss dr5 database of 675,000 spectra to assemble a large sample of emission - line galaxies .",
    "two criteria were applied : 1 ) the [ o iii ] @xmath94363 line must be detected to allow for a direct determination of element abundances ; and 2 ) obvious high - metallicity agn spectra are excluded .",
    "thus , contrary to @xcite and @xcite , @xcite were not specifically looking for agn .",
    "these criteria resulted in a sample of @xmath510,000 emission - line galaxies ( elg ) . while studying that sample to look for elgs with broad components in their strong emission lines , @xcite came across four galaxies with very unusual spectra .",
    "the general characteristics of the four galaxies are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "their absolute magnitudes are typical of dwarf galaxies . because of their relatively large distance ( @xmath11 @xmath5 0.1 - 0.3 ) and relatively small angular sizes ( @xmath5 1 - 2 , only slightly larger than the seeing disk ) , their sdss images ( fig . [ images ] ) do not show much details .",
    "they possess a compact structure .",
    "two galaxies , j1025 + 1402 and j1047 + 0739 , have an approximately round shape , while the other two more distant galaxies , j0045 + 1339 and j1222 + 3602 , have a distorted shape suggestive of mergers .",
    "their colors are not blue like the other elgs , but vary from red to yellow to green . their spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , resemble those of moderately to very low - metallicity high - excitation h ii regions : their oxygen abundances are in the range 12@xmath12@xmath13 o / h @xmath57.47.9 , i.e. their heavy element mass fractions vary from @xmath14/19 to @xmath14/5 if the solar calibration 12@xmath12@xmath13o / h@xmath158.65 of @xcite is adopted .",
    "@xcite found that there is however a striking difference : the strong permitted emission lines , mainly the h@xmath0 @xmath96863 line , show very prominent broad components .",
    "these are characterized by somewhat unusual properties : 1 ) their h@xmath0 full widths at zero intensity @xmath16 vary from 102 to 158  , corresponding to expansion velocities between 2200 and 3500 km s@xmath4 ; 2 ) the broad h@xmath0 luminosities @xmath17 are extraordinarily large , varying from 3@xmath110@xmath2 to 2@xmath110@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this is to be compared with the range 10@xmath1810@xmath19 erg  s@xmath4 found by @xcite for the other elgs with broad - line emission .",
    "the ratio of h@xmath0 flux in the broad component to that in the narrow component varies from 0.4 to 3.4 , as compared to 0.010.4 for the other galaxies ; 3 ) the balmer lines show a very steep decrement , suggesting collisional excitation and that the broad emission comes from very dense gas ( @xmath20@xmath2110@xmath22 @xmath23 ) .",
    "evidently , these galaxies are exceedingly rare , since they constitute only 4/675,000 or 0.0006% of our original sample .    to account for the broad line emission in these four objects , @xcite have considered various physical mechanisms : a ) wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ; b ) stellar winds from ofp or luminous blue variable stars ; c ) single or multiple supernova ( sn ) remnants propagating in the interstellar medium ; d ) sn bubbles ; e ) shocks propagating in the circumstellar envelopes of sne ; and f ) agn . while mechanisms a - d can account for @xmath17 @xmath5 10@xmath24 to 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath4 , they can not provide for luminosities that are 30 to 200 times greater .",
    "these very large luminosities are more likely associated with sn shocks or agn .",
    "@xcite have considered sne because their h@xmath0 luminosities are larger ( @xmath510@xmath2510@xmath2 erg  s@xmath4 ) than those of the other sn types , iip and iil , and they decrease less rapidly .    to decide whether type iin sne or agn are responsible for the broad emission in these galaxies , monitoring of their spectral features on the relatively long time scale of several years is necessary . if broad features are produced by iin type sne , then we would expect a decrease in the broad line luminosities .",
    "no significant temporal evolution would be expected in the case of an agn .",
    "additionally , higher signal - to - noise ratio spectra are necessary to put better constraints on the presence of the high - ionization [ ne v ] @xmath93426 and he ii @xmath94686 emission lines , good indicators of a source of hard non - thermal radiation . in order to check for temporal evolution ,",
    "we have obtained second - epoch spectra of the above four galaxies with broad emission , using the 3.5 m apache point observatory ( apo ) telescopephl 293b , because its broad h@xmath0 luminosity is only 8.6@xmath110@xmath18 erg s@xmath4 , some 10@xmath26 - 10@xmath27 times lower than those of the other four agn candidates .",
    "the broad h@xmath0 luminosity of j22300006 has been erroneously given in table 8 of @xcite as having 10 times its true value .",
    "given this relatively low luminosity and the fact that a new 3.5 m apo spectrum of j22300006 shows that its broad hydrogen lines have a p cygni profile with a blue - shifted absorption , the broad emission probably originates from a stellar wind rather than from an accretion disk around a agn .",
    "most likely , the broad emission in j22300006 is caused by a strong outburst in a bright luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star .",
    "similar broad hydrogen emission has been detected recently by @xcite in the extremely metal - deficient dwarf galaxy ddo 68 . ] .",
    "we describe the observations in  2 .",
    "we discuss in  3 the main properties of the broad emission and show that they can be accounted for by low - metallicity intermediate - mass agn .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "new high signal - to - noise ratio optical spectra were obtained for the four galaxies listed in table [ tab1 ] , using the 3.5 m apo telescope on the nights of 2007 november 15 and 2008 february 6 .",
    "the observations were made with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) in the both the blue and red wavelength ranges .",
    "a 15@xmath1360  slit was used . in the blue range ,",
    "we use the b400 grating with a linear dispersion of 1.83  / pix and a central wavelength of 4400 , while in the red range we use the r300 grating with a linear dispersion 2.31  / pix and a central wavelength of 7500 .",
    "the above instrumental set - up gave a spatial scale along the slit of 08 pixel@xmath4 on the night of 2007 november 15 and of 04 pixel@xmath4 on the night of 2008 february 6 ( the latter scale is smaller by a factor of 2 than the previous one because we did not perform pixel binning for the latter spectra ) , a spectral range @xmath53600 ",
    "9600  and a spectral resolution of 7   ( fwhm ) .",
    "the slit was oriented along the parallactic angle and the total exposure time was 45 minutes for each galaxy .",
    "the observations were broken up into 3 subexposures to allow for removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the kitt peak irs spectroscopic standard stars feige 110 ( 2007 november 15 ) , feige 34 and g191b2b ( 2008 february 6 ) were observed for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he - ne - ar comparison arcs were obtained at the beginning of each night for wavelength calibration .",
    "the data reduction procedures are the same as described in @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using iraf .",
    "we then use the iraf software routines identify , reidentify , fitcoord , transform to perform wavelength calibration and correct for distortion and tilt for each frame .",
    "night sky subtraction was performed using the routine background .",
    "the level of night sky emission was determined from the closest regions to the galaxy that are free of galaxian stellar and nebular line emission , as well as of emission from foreground and background sources .",
    "a one - dimensional spectrum was then extracted from the two - dimensional frame using the apall routine .",
    "an extraction aperture of 15 @xmath1 4  was adopted .",
    "its area is similar to that of the 3  round aperture used in the sdss spectra and allows to gather @xmath28 90% of the light of our compact galaxies .",
    "comparison of the line intensities of the sdss @xcite and 3.5 m spectra ( table [ tab2 ] ) shows that they agree well , validating our choice of the extraction aperture . before extraction , the three distinct two - dimensional spectra of each object",
    "were carefully aligned using the spatial locations of the brightest part in each spectrum , so that spectra were extracted at the same positions in all subexposures .",
    "we then summed the individual spectra from each subexposure after manual removal of the cosmic rays hits .",
    "the resulting apo spectra of the four galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "a strong broad h@xmath0 emission line is present in all spectra , very similar to the one seen in the sdss spectra of the same galaxies obtained 37 years earlier @xcite .",
    "the broad components in the h@xmath29 emission line are considerably weaker , suggesting a steep balmer decrement and hence that the broad emission originates in a very dense gas . in the case of j1047 + 0739 , broad he i is also present , as in the sdss spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have derived element abundances from the narrow emission line fluxes .",
    "these fluxes have been measured using gaussian fitting with the iraf splot routine .",
    "they have been corrected for both extinction , using the reddening curve of @xcite , and underlying hydrogen stellar absorption , derived simultaneously by an iterative procedure as described by @xcite and using the observed decrements of the narrow hydrogen balmer h@xmath30 @xmath94101 , h@xmath31 @xmath94340 , h@xmath29 @xmath94861 and h@xmath0 @xmath96563 lines .",
    "it is assumed in this procedure that hydrogen line emission is produced only by spontaneous transitions in recombination cascades , i.e. we neglect possible collisional excitation .",
    "such a situation usually holds in low - density h ii regions ionized by stellar radiation such as those considered here .",
    "@xcite have shown that the use of different reddening curves has little influence on the extinction - corrected fluxes ( relative to the h@xmath29 flux ) in the optical range and modify only slightly the extinction coefficient .",
    "the reason is that the spectra are corrected in such a way so that the relative intensities of the extinction - corrected hydrogen lines correspond to their theoretical values .",
    "the extinction - corrected fluxes 100@xmath1@xmath32(@xmath9)/@xmath32(h@xmath29 ) of the narrow lines for each galaxy , together with the extinction coefficient @xmath33(h@xmath29 ) , the equivalent width of the h@xmath29 emission line ew(h@xmath29 ) , the h@xmath29 observed flux @xmath34(h@xmath29 ) and the equivalent widths of the underlying hydrogen absorption lines ew(abs ) are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the physical conditions and element abundances of the h ii regions in the four agn candidates are derived from the narrow line fluxes following @xcite .",
    "the element abundances derived from the 2.5 m sdss spectra @xcite and from the 3.5 m spectra ( this paper ) are shown in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "we find the abundances and the abundance ratios obtained for the four galaxies from the two sets of observations agree well .",
    "the derived abundances are in the range characteristic of low - metallicity dwarf emission - line galaxies @xcite .",
    "this implies that the narrow emission lines arise primarily from regions ionized by stellar ionizing radiation , and that any contribution of a possible agn component to the narrow line emission is small .      using gaussian fitting",
    ", we have measured the fluxes of the broad component of the h@xmath0 line after subtraction of the narrow component .",
    "these fluxes are shown in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "comparison of sdss and apo broad h@xmath0 fluxes shows that they have remained nearly constant ( with variations @xmath35 20% ) over a period of @xmath5 3  7 years .",
    "this likely rules out the hypothesis that the broad line fluxes are due to type iin sn because their h@xmath0 fluxes should have decreased significantly over this time interval .",
    "there is one known exception , sn1996cr , where the h@xmath0 flux has remained constant for @xmath36  yrs @xcite , although here the luminosity of h@xmath0 is only @xmath5 10@xmath25 erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "maintaining an h@xmath0 luminosity of 10@xmath2 ",
    "10@xmath3 erg  s@xmath4 for such durations in our objects would require nearly the entire energy budget of a sn ( @xmath37 10@xmath38  10@xmath39 ergs ) .",
    "we thus rule out type  iin sne .",
    "there remains the agn scenario .",
    "can accretion disks around black holes in these low - metallicity dwarf galaxies account for their spectral properties ?",

    "ii @xmath94686 , the apparent weakness of such emission lines , however , may be accounted for by the low metallicities of our galaxies .",
    "none of our objects were detected in the nvss or first radio catalogs , demonstrating that they are faint radio sources .",
    "another way to check for the presence of an agn in a galaxy is to check for its location in the emission - line diagnostic diagram of @xcite ( bpt ) .",
    "it can be seen that all four objects lie in the region corresponding to star - forming galaxies ( sfg ) , to the left of the region occupied by agn with low - mass black holes and with metallicities ranging from 2 to 1/4 that of the sun @xcite .",
    "however , their locations in the sfg region do not necessarily disqualify them as agn candidates .",
    "photoionization models of agn show that lowering their metallicity moves them to the left of the bpt diagram , so that they end up in the sfg region @xcite .",

    "it is seen that models with 12@xmath12@xmath13o / h@xmath157.8 and in which the nonthermal ionizing radiation contributes @xmath5010% of the total ionizing radiation can account well for the location of all four galaxies in the bpt diagram , independently of the slope of the power - law spectrum .",
    "how about the high - ionization lines ?",
    "can their absence be due to high dust extinction in the central part of the galaxy ?",
    "we consider this possibility unlikely because in this case , broad h@xmath0 emission from the accretion disk surrounding the black hole would not be seen also .",

    "there are several points to be made concerning fig .",
    "[ diagn]b .",
    "first , in contrast to the low - ionization line fluxes ( fig .",

    "second , while there is no significant change of the predicted fluxes of the he ii @xmath94686 emission line with metallicity , the predicted flux of the [ ne v ] @xmath93426 linearly scales with 12+logo / h . third , at a given metallicity , the detectability of the high - ionization lines depends on two parameters : one is the ratio @xmath41 of nonthermal - to - thermal ionizing radiation and the other is the slope of the power - law ionizing spectrum . if we adopt 12+logo / h = 7.8 as typical for our galaxies , then fig .",
    "[ diagn]b shows that models that satisfy the non - detectability limit of the high - ionization lines ( i.e. that fall within the shaded box ) are characterized either by a steep slope and a not excessively small @xmath41 ( @xmath0 = 2 and @xmath41 @xmath5 0.1 ) or by a shallower slope and a very low @xmath41 ( @xmath0 = 1 and @xmath41 @xmath5 0.03 ) .",
    "we expect intermediate - mass black holes to have accretion disks that are hotter than those around supermassive black holes , and hence their ionizing spectrum to have a shallower slope , nearer 1 rather than 2 .",
    "if that is the case , then the fraction of ionizing nonthermal to thermal radiation is very small in our dwarf galaxies , @xmath5 3% .",
    "it is also possible that the absence of strong high - ionization lines is caused by a high covering factor of the accretion disk . in this case",
    "the hard radiation would be absorbed inside the dense accretion disk and no high - ionization forbidden lines would be formed .",
    "we now estimate the masses of the central black holes .",
    "it has been shown ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that continuum and broad line luminosities in agn can be used to determine the size and geometry of the broad emission - line region and the mass of the central black hole .",
    "examining a large sample of broad - line agn , @xcite have found that the h@xmath0 luminosity scales almost linearly with the optical continuum luminosity and that a strong correlation exists between the h@xmath0 and h@xmath29 line widths . on the basis of these two empirical correlations ,",
    "those authors have derived the following relations for the central black hole mass :    @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the broad h@xmath0 and continuum ( at @xmath9 = 5100 ) luminosities , and fwhm@xmath55 and fwhm@xmath56 are respectively the full widths at half maximum of the h@xmath29 and h@xmath0 emission lines .    in table",

    "since the reddening due to dust extinction in dense regions may be larger than that derived from the narrow hydrogen emission lines , the derived @xmath57(h@xmath0 ) should be considered as lower limits . the @xmath57(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath9@xmath58(5100 ) of our galaxies follow closely the correlation between h@xmath0 and continuum luminosities found by @xcite .",
    "this implies that our galaxies are very likely the same type of objects as those considered by @xcite .",

    "however , we find that single gaussian fits do not reproduce well the broad low - intensity wings of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "this suggests that that the line broadening is caused not only by gas motions but also by light scattering .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by a steep balmer decrement ( the h@xmath0-to - h@xmath29 flux ratio is greater than @xmath5 7 in our four galaxies ) , implying high gas densities and possibly high optical depths in the h@xmath0 line .",

    "the steep balmer decrements of the broad hydrogen lines and the very high luminosities of the broad h@xmath0 line in all four galaxies ( 3@xmath110@xmath2 to 2@xmath110@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ) suggest that the broad emission arises from very dense and high luminosity regions such as those associated with supernovae ( sne ) of type iin or with accretion disks around black holes",
    ". however , the relative constancy of the broad h@xmath0 luminosities over a period of 37 years likely rules out the sn mechanism .",

    "<S> such extraordinarily high broad h@xmath0 luminosities can not be accounted for by massive stars at different stages of their evolution . by comparing with the first - epoch sdss spectra , we find that the broad h@xmath0 luminosities have remained constant over a period of 3  7 years , which probably excludes type iin supernovae as a possible mechanism of broad emission . </S>",
