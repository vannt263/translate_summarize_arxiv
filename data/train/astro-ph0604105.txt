    "their light - curves exhibited a power - law decay , as expected from the power - law decay of the shock lorentz factor with observer time and the power - law distribution with energy of shock - accelerated electrons ( together , these two properties lead to synchrotron spectrum characteristics with a power - law temporal evolution ) .",
    "in general , the optical and x - ray light - curve decay indices were found consistent with the slope of the afterglow spectrum ( wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ) .",
    "further testing of the standard blast - wave model can be done by comparing the light - curve decays at different wavelengths .",
    "for instance , the light - curve breaks ( steepening of power - law decay ) arising from the dynamics or the collimation of the grb outflow ( rhoads 1999 ) should be achromatic , occurring simultaneously at all frequencies .",
    "the lack of a sufficiently extended x - ray monitoring of pre - swift afterglows prevented us to test if the breaks observed in the optical light - curves of many grb afterglows were achromatic , with the possible exceptions of grbs 010222 and 030329 . for the former ,",
    "a single 10 day x - ray measurement ( int zand 2001 ) indicates the existence of a break in the x - ray light - curve at @xmath2 days , which could have been simultaneous with the gradual optical break . for the latter ,",
    "a break in the x - ray light - curve at 0.5 day ( tiengo 2003 ) is accompanied by a steepening of the optical light - curve decay ( lipkin 2004 ) , however the variability of the optical emission makes a jet - break identification difficult .    in the last year",
    ", the swift satellite has monitored the x - ray emission of dozens of afterglows , and has shown that , after a rather shallow decay , the x - ray light - curves exhibit a steepening at about 14 hours after the burst . because of their dimness , only a small fraction of these afterglows were followed in the optical .",
    "the only cases so far for an x - ray light - curve break possibly accompanied by an optical steepening are the grb afterglows 050525a ( blustin 2006 ) and 050801 ( rykoff 2006 ) .",
    "the x - ray light - curve of the former appears more complex than just a broken power , with an uncertain break time , while the optical emission shows a brightening ( klotz 2005 ) around the epoch of the x - ray break .",
    "the optical and x - ray breaks of the latter occur much earlier than for other afterglows , at only 45 minutes after the burst .",
    "surprisingly , as shown in figure 1 , the optical light - curves of other grb afterglows do not exhibit a steepening at the epoch of the x - ray break . summarizing their temporal properties ,",
    "the x - ray light - curves decays steepen from @xmath3 to @xmath4 at @xmath5 hours , however the optical light - curves , which start 12 decades before @xmath1 , maintain a @xmath6 decay after @xmath1 .",
    "the evidence for the x - ray break chromaticity is weak for grbs 050607 and 050713a ( lower panel of figure 1 ) , for which there is only one post - break optical measurement ( possibly contaminated by the host galaxy emission ) but is rather compelling for grbs 050401 , 050802 and 050922c ( upper panel of figure 1 ) . in particular ,",
    "no optical light - curve break is seen for the grb afterglow 050401 for 2.5 decades in time after @xmath1 ( watson 2006 ) .",
    "only the optical emission of the grb afterglow 0509022c exhibits a steepening , but at @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the conditions required for the external shock to produce such a chromatic x - ray light - curve break .",
    "the afterglow emission is described by @xmath8 as expected in the standard blast - wave model for grb afterglows ( paczyski & rhoads 1993 , mszros & rees 1997 , sari , narayan & piran 1998 ) , with `` o '' and `` x '' for the subscript `` @xmath9 '' designating optical and x - ray quantities , respectively . additionally , the pre- and post - break x - ray light - curve decay indices are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the lack of an optical light - curve break contemporaneous with that seen in the x - ray shows that the x - ray light - curve breaks do not arise from the outflow collimation ( a jet ) or angular structure ( where the ejecta kinetic energy is a function of direction ) . for this reason ,",
    "we consider only the case of an uniform outflow which is sufficiently relativistic that its boundaries are not yet visible to the observer .",
    "the possibility that the x - ray light - curve break is caused by the passage of a spectral break through the x - rays is largely excluded by the lack of a significant spectral evolution ( cusumano 2006 , de pasquale 2006 , nousek 2006 , morris 2006 ) , a fact also pointed out by fan & piran ( 2006 ) for the x - ray afterglows 050319 and 050401 .",
    "in contrast , if the cooling break frequency , @xmath12 , ( which is the frequency at which radiate the electrons whose cooling timescale is equal to the dynamical timescale ) had crossed the x - ray band , then the x - ray continuum should have softened by @xmath13 for a homogeneous circumburst medium ( for which @xmath14 ) or hardened by @xmath15 for a wind - like medium ( for which @xmath16 ) .    should the above spectral evolution be measured across @xmath1 in other x - ray afterglows , the passage of @xmath12 through x - ray domain would lead to a break of the x - ray light - curve with the following properties : @xmath17 @xmath18 if the electron radiative cooling is synchrotron - dominated ( compton parameter @xmath19 ) . in this case , the magnitude of the x - ray light - curve break is @xmath20 , smaller than that observed for most ( if not all ) swift afterglows .    if inverse - compton scattering dominated the electron cooling ( @xmath21 ) then , for a homogeneous medium , the cooling frequency would decrease more slowly or can even increase , which leads to an even smaller x - ray break magnitude : @xmath22 ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "a stronger x - ray break is produced by a wind - like medium , where an inverse - compton dominated electron cooling accelerates the increase in time of @xmath12 , leading to @xmath23 ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "however , in this case , the optical and post - break x - ray decay indices should be equal ( @xmath24 ) , in contradiction with what is observed for all afterglows in table 1 .",
    "therefore , the passage of the cooling frequency through the x - ray as a reason for the x - ray light - curve breaks shown in figure 1 is incompatible not only with the lack of a x - ray spectral evolution but also with the measured optical and x - ray decay indices .      in a model where both the optical and x - ray emissions arise from the same afterglow synchrotron component",
    ", the optical and x - ray light - curves can have different behaviours if the cooling frequency lies between the optical and x - ray .",
    "then one can determine its evolution from the optical and x - ray decay indices .",
    "in the external shock model , the optical and x - ray afterglow fluxes are related by @xmath25 it follows that @xmath12 must have the following evolution @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) was used .    for the afterglows of table 1 , @xmath29 , implying a post - break decrease of the cooling frequency , @xmath30 , which is much faster than that expected in the standard forward shock model . in this model , for constant microphysical parameters and no energy injection in the blast - wave",
    ", the steepest decrease is obtained for a homogeneous medium and synchrotron - dominated electron cooling : @xmath14 .",
    "energy injection in the forward shock by means of some grb ejecta catching - up with it leads to a faster decrease of @xmath12 but can not by itself produce a chromatic x - ray light - curve break because it alters the afterglow flux below the cooling frequency as well .",
    "instead , the fast decrease of @xmath12 suggests that the fraction of the post - shock energy in magnetic fields , @xmath31 , is evolving . because the afterglow emission also depends on the fraction @xmath32 of the post - shock energy that is imparted to electrons",
    ", we also allow it to be time - dependent .",
    "given that the afterglow light - curves are power - laws in observer time , evolution of the microphysical parameters and blast - wave kinetic energy @xmath33 ( allowing for energy injection ) must also be power - laws in @xmath34 .",
    "the latter implies that the blast - wave lorentz factor @xmath35 is also a power - law in time , hence @xmath33 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 must evolve as power - laws of @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the energy of all ejecta with lorentz factor larger than a given @xmath35 which have caught - up with the forward shock . for a decelerating blast - wave ,",
    "the increase of its kinetic energy is equivalent to @xmath38 .",
    "we also allow for a power - law stratification of the ambient medium , @xmath39 to be determined from the optical and x - ray afterglow properties .",
    "the condition @xmath40 ensures that the blast - wave is decelerated , for any @xmath38 .",
    "the synchrotron optical ( @xmath41 ) and x - ray ( @xmath42 ) light - curves can be inferred from the decay indices given in panaitescu & kumar ( 2004 ) by using @xmath43 which follows from assuming an adiabatic blast - wave , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mass of the swept - up medium , and from the relation between the blast - wave radius and photon arrival time , @xmath46 .",
    "the results are @xmath47 @xmath48\\ ] ] @xmath49   \\label{axsy}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the exponent of the power - law electron distribution with energy in the forward shock : @xmath51 @xmath52 being the typical ( comoving ) lorentz factor of the shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "we do not consider a scenario where the evolutions of the microphysical parameters change at @xmath1 to yield an x - ray light - curve break because such a scenario is very contrived : those changes in the evolution of @xmath32 and @xmath31 would have to `` conspire '' to leave the optical power - law light - curve unaffected .",
    "a more natural scenario is that where the evolution of the microphysical parameters with the blast - wave lorentz factor is steady ( constant @xmath53 and @xmath54 in equation [ expo ] ) and the x - ray light - curve break is caused by a change in the evolution of @xmath35 .",
    "the latter could be due to @xmath55 the blast - wave encountering the termination shock of the burst progenitor s wind or @xmath56 cessation of energy injection into the blast - wave .    in the former scenario , the termination shock marks the transition between the freely expanding wind of a massive star and the homogenized shocked wind .",
    "substituting @xmath57 at @xmath58 and @xmath59 at @xmath60 in equation ( [ axsy ] ) , one can find the parameter @xmath61 for the energy injection .",
    "however , for all the afterglows listed in table 1 , we obtain an unphysical result : @xmath62 , therefore this scenario does not work .    in the second scenario ,",
    "the cessation of energy injection implies a lower cut - off to the lorentz factor of the incoming ejecta . from equation ( [ aosy ] ) it can be shown that the condition that the optical decay index remains unchanged when @xmath63 switches to @xmath64 leads to @xmath65 there is no obvious reason for the evolution of the microphysical parameters with the blast - wave lorentz factor to `` know '' about the structure of the ambient medium , hence this scenario remains contrived .",
    "the above condition also shows why the standard forward shock model with energy injection can not explain the chromaticity of the x - ray light - curve break : for @xmath66 ( constant microphysical parameters ) , the resulting medium structural parameter , @xmath67 , leads to an optical decay index @xmath68 which , for the x - ray spectral slopes given in table 1 , is much steeper than observed .",
    "substituting equation ( [ pibs ] ) in ( [ aosy ] ) , the optical decay index requires a circumburst medium with @xmath69 as shown in table 1 , the optical decay index @xmath70 and x - ray spectral slope @xmath71 of the six afterglows with chromatic x - ray breaks require a circumburst medium with a wind - like stratification . for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , equation ( [ pibs ] ) , which is",
    "the condition for the lack of an optical break , becomes @xmath74 the energy injection parameter @xmath61 is determined by the steepening of the x - ray light - curve decay . from equation ( [ axsy ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath75 finally , the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be determined from the decays of the optical and post - break x - ray light - curves . transforming to observer time with the aid of equation ( [ g ] ) ,",
    "the average evolutions given in table 1 are @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 before the x - ray break epoch .",
    "if the circumburst medium is sufficiently dense then inverse - compton ( ic ) emission can outshine synchrotron in the x - rays .",
    "alternatively , the synchrotron spectrum could have a cut - off below the x - ray , as the shock - accelerated electrons may not acquire sufficient energy ( li & waxman 2006 ) .",
    "we consider here the case where the optical afterglow is synchrotron emission and the x - ray afterglow arises from inverse - compton scattering .",
    "the ic continuum has spectral breaks at the frequencies @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the frequency at which the @xmath52-electrons radiate and @xmath82 is the lorentz factor of the electrons which cool radiatively on a timescale equal to the dynamical timescale ( they radiate at the cooling frequency @xmath12 ) . in the standard model for the forward shock emission ( sari 1998 , panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) , it can be shown that the decay indices of the ic light - curves are : @xmath83 @xmath84\\ ] ] where @xmath85 for @xmath86 ( in which case @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 for @xmath89 ( in which case @xmath90 ) .",
    "synchrotron - dominated electron cooling ( @xmath91 ) was assumed for the latter expressions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; if ic dominates ( @xmath94 ) then @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    aside from the above two possible locations of the x - ray domain relative to the ic spectral breaks",
    ", the cooling frequency could be either above or below the optical range ( the optical light - curve decay index being given by equations [ aosy ] and [ axsy ] , respectively ) , which yields four possible combinations to be considered .",
    "just as for the case where the x - ray afterglow were attributed to synchrotron emission , we obtain an unphysical solution ( @xmath62 ) if the x - ray light - curve break is attributed to the blast - wave encountering the wind termination shock . for the scenario where this break arises from cessation of energy injection ,",
    "@xmath38 solutions exist only for @xmath97 and , for three afterglows , only if the cooling frequency is higher than optical frequencies ( in this case , the lack of an optical light - curve break leads to equation [ pibs ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the x - ray light - curve break determines the energy injection parameter @xmath61 and the result is the same as when the x - ray afterglow was assumed to be synchrotron emission ( equation [ e ] ) .",
    "however , the evolution of the microphysical parameters with the blast - wave lorentz are weaker now because the decay indices of the ic light - curves have a stronger dependence on @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the lack of an optical light - curve break contemporaneous with the steepening of the power - law decay observed at @xmath98 hours in the x - ray light - curves of several swift afterglows ( figure 1 ) is a puzzling new feature .",
    "it does not originate from the outflow collimation ( such breaks should be chromatic ) nor from the passage of a spectral break through the x - ray ( such light - curve breaks should be accompanied by a spectral evolution ) .",
    "if the optical and x - ray afterglows are the same synchrotron forward - shock emission then the only possibility left is that the chromatic x - ray light - curve breaks are caused by the evolution of a spectral break @xmath99 located between the optical and x - ray .",
    "that evolution could be determined from the optical and x - ray decay indices and spectral slopes ( equation [ nub ] ) .",
    "however , the optical intrinsic spectral slope may be difficult to measure because of dust extinction in the host galaxy , as is the case of grb 050401 ( watson 2006 ) .",
    "for the grb afterglow 050401 , whose optical emission has been monitored well after the x - ray light - curve break , the required post - break evolution of @xmath99 is barely compatible with the lack of a break in the optical light - curve until 10 days : in the most favourable situation , where @xmath99 was just above the xrt s 0.3 kev threshold at @xmath100 hours , the @xmath101 required by the post - break x - ray decay implies that this spectral break should cross the r - band at 8 days . over the four decades in time during which the optical afterglow of grb 050401 exhibits an unbroken power - law decay , the energy of the electrons radiating in the optical increases by a factor 30 , for a homogeneous circumburst medium ( 100 for a wind - like medium ) .",
    "moreover , over four decades in time , the ratio of the energy of the optical - emitting electrons to that of the peak of the electron distribution increases by a factor @xmath102 .",
    "these facts suggest that the spectral break at @xmath99 is not associated with a break in the distribution with energy of the shock - accelerated electrons , as in this case it would be difficult to understand why @xmath99 remains above the optical over a @xmath103-fold increase in time .",
    "if the spectral break @xmath99 is the cooling frequency ( @xmath12 ) then its evolution required by the decay indices listed in table 1 is @xmath104 or faster , exceeding the fastest decay expected for the cooling frequency in the standard blast - wave model : @xmath14 , for a homogeneous circumburst medium ( for a wind - like medium , @xmath12 should increase at least as fast as @xmath105 ) .",
    "this shows that evolving microphysical parameters for the electron energy and magnetic field are required to explain the chromatic x - ray light - curve breaks .",
    "this feature of the forward shock model was not previously required by the analysis of the broadband emission of pre - swift afterglows .    attributing the x - ray light - curve break to a sudden change in the evolution of the microphysical parameters seems ad - hoc and contrived because their evolution would have to be such that a break in the optical light - curve is not produced .",
    "a less contrived scenario is that the microphysical parameters have a steady evolution with the blast - wave lorentz factor and that the x - ray light - curve break arises from cessation of energy injection in the forward shock ( as previously proposed by nousek 2006 , panaitescu 2006 , zhang 2006 ) .",
    "then the lack of an optical light - curve break simultaneous with that seen in the x - rays requires that the evolution of the microphysical parameters satisfies equation ( [ ib ] ) , whether the x - ray emission is synchrotron or inverse - compton .    in this scenario , to accommodate the optical and x - ray properties of the six grb afterglows considered here requires that the stratification of the circumburst medium ( table 1 ) is that of a stellar wind , @xmath106 , as expected from a massive star progenitor for long grbs ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "however , such an ambient medium was not found to be consistent in all cases with the jet - break observed in optical light - curves .",
    "for instance , the sharp optical breaks of grb afterglows 990510 , 000301c and 011211 are better modelled with a homogeneous external medium , whether the break is attributed to seeing the jet boundary or the bright core of a structured outflow seen off - axis ( panaitescu 2005 ) . in a wind - like medium , the slower deceleration of the blast - wave leads to a more gradual steepening of the power - law decay of the afterglow emission ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) , as was observed in many , but not all , pre - swift afterglows with optical light - curve breaks .",
    "the identification of one or the other kind of circumburst medium may have to do with the location of the termination shock of the stellar free wind . for the innermost locations of this shock ( at less than @xmath107 cm ) , the boundary of a narrow jet may become visible after the jet has crossed the shock and entered the quasi - homogeneous shell of shocked wind , while for outer locations the jet - break occurs in the free wind region .",
    "the lack of a jet - break signature in the six swift afterglows analyzed here can be explained if their outflows are not tightly collimated .",
    "furthermore , as discussed above , the chromaticity of their x - ray light - curve breaks indicates that the afterglow emission occurred in the freely expanding stellar wind .",
    "a difficulty with the above model is that there is no evident reason for which evolution of the microphysical parameters should satisfy equation ( [ ib ] ) . in the absence of a physical reason for this",
    ", an alternative conclusion would be that , at least in some afterglows , the optical and x - ray emissions arise from different outflows .",
    "however , such a conclusion is not supported by pre - swift afterglow observations .",
    "for example , the optical and x - ray emissions of the twelve afterglows modelled numerically by panaitescu ( 2005 ) can be explained with a single outflow .",
    "the optical and x - ray continua shown in figures 10 and 11 of nardini ( 2006 ) also suggest that , in many cases , they could be the same afterglow spectral component , although such a test is complicated by the likely presence of the cooling break between the optical and x - ray and by the possible dimming and reddening of the optical emission by dust in the host galaxy",
    ".    further work , both theoretical and observational , is needed to verify if afterglows such as those discussed here are indeed weakly collimated outflows interacting with a wind environment and leading to shocks with evolving microphysical parameters or if the optical and x - ray afterglow emissions are produced by different regions of the grb outflow .",
