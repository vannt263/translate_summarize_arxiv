    "forward quantities ( total cross section , @xmath0 , slope and curvature parameters ) are fundamental quantities in the investigation of hadron - hadron scattering . in particular",
    ", total cross section and @xmath0 are expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude by @xcite    @xmath4    where , @xmath5 is the center of mass energy and @xmath6 the four - momentum transfer squared .    the theoretical description of these quantities as function of the energy constitute , presently , a great challenge . among the variety of approaches , the analytical models are characterized by suitable analytic parametrizations to both quantities and the use of dispersion relations connecting real and imaginary parts of the amplitude ( principle of analyticity ) .",
    "also , particle - particle and particle - antiparticle scattering are simultaneously investigated by combining even and odd amplitudes ( principle of crossing symmetry ) .",
    "presently , the highest energies reached in accelerator experiments correspond to antiproton - proton scattering , @xmath7 tev and this value is nearly thirty times the highest energy reached in the case of proton - proton scattering , @xmath8 gev .",
    "these differences are the responsible for the difficulties present in the simultaneous investigation of both reactions , meanly in the case of the behaviors as function of the energy and asymptotic limits .",
    "in this communication we treat @xmath1 and @xmath2 forward scattering through analytical models and the central point is a critical investigation based on two observations :    1 .",
    ": :    the total cross section is an experimental quantity , basically    determined by counting the number of elastic and inelastic events in    the scattering process . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 is a    free fit parameter , obtained through fits to the differential cross    section data in the region of interference coulomb - nuclear ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath0 extracted from    experiments are model dependent .",
    "we conclude that    @xmath9 and @xmath0 have different    status as physical quantities and this puts limitations in the    simultaneous investigation of both quantities in constrained    approaches , such as dispersion relations .",
    "2 . : :    beyond the energy region of the accelerators there are experimental    information on @xmath1 total cross section from cosmic ray    experiments . despite of the high error bars in the numerical results    and also some discrepancies , they are usually shown as a support to    several model and analysis predictions .    the first observation suggests the investigation of the effect of simultaneous and independent fits to @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the second , the determination of possible statistical bounds on the raise of these quantities , due to all the cosmic ray information presently available ( taking account of the large error bars ) .",
    "these are the points we are interested in .",
    "the basic procedure is the choice of suitable parametrizations for @xmath9 with different asymptotic behaviors and the use of analyticity ( dispersion ) relations in order to connect @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "observation 1 is treated through individual and simultaneous fits to both quantities and observation 2 by selecting different ensembles of data based on distinct cosmic ray information , as will be explained in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the experimental data investigated and discuss the discrepancies concerning cosmic ray information . in sec .",
    "iii we review the main formulas in the dispersion relation approach and introduce two different parametrizations for the total cross section , namely the donnachie - landshof and the kang - nicolescu models .",
    "the results of all the fits are presented in sec .",
    "iv and the conclusions and some final remarks are the contents of sec . v.",
    "in the case of accelerator experiments , data on @xmath9 from @xmath1 and @xmath2 total cross sections and also estimations of the @xmath0 parameter have been accumulated for a long time .",
    "the data sets , compiled and analyzed by the particle data group , have become a standard reference and are available ( also readable files ) at _ http://pdg.lbl.gov_. recent analysis has shown that general fits are stable for @xmath5 above @xmath12 9 gev @xcite .",
    "for this reason in this work we make use of these sets for energies above @xmath13 gev and in our analysis the statistic and systematic errors were added linearly .",
    "the total cross section data are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the extraction of the proton - proton total cross section from cosmic ray experiments is based on the determination of the proton - air production cross section from analysis of extensive air showers .",
    "detailed review on the subtle involved may be found in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we only recall the two main steps , stressing the model dependence involved .",
    "the first step concerns the determination of the proton - air production cross section , namely , the `` inelastic cross section in which at least one new hadron is produced in addition to nuclear fragments '' @xcite .",
    "this is obtained by the formulas    @xmath14    where , @xmath15 is the interaction length of protons in the atmosphere , @xmath16 the shower attenuation length and @xmath17 is a measure of the dissipation of the energy through the shower .",
    "the @xmath16 is a experimental quantity determined through the @xmath18 attenuation method or the zenith angle attenuation technique @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is obtained through monte carlo simulation and so is strongly model dependent @xcite .    in a second step @xmath19",
    "is obtained from @xmath20 through the multiple diffraction formalism by glauber and matthiae @xcite and taking account of the screening correction ( @xmath21 ) :    @xmath22    two important inputs at this point are the nucleon distribution function and the slope parameter @xmath23 , necessary in the parametrization of the proton - proton scattering amplitude :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the four - momentum transfer squared .",
    "the results presently available from cosmic ray experiments cover the region @xmath26 tev and are characterized by discrepancies , mainly due to the model dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , we can classify these results according to the degree of consistence of the analysis and , simultaneously , by value of the total cross section extracted , as explained in what follows .",
    "from one hand the results usually quoted in the literature concern those obtained by the fly s eye collaboration in 1984 @xcite and akeno ( agasa ) collaboration in 1993 @xcite . in the first case , the authors used @xmath28 and a relation of proportionality between @xmath23 and @xmath19 as predicted by the geometrical scaling model @xcite . at @xmath29 tev the cross sections results are @xcite :    @xmath30    the akeno collaboration used @xmath31 and the durand and pi method @xcite to extract the proton - proton cross sections in the region @xmath32 tev .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "1 together with the fly s eye value at @xmath29 tev .    on the other hand , in 1987 gaisser , sukhatme , yodh ( gsy ) making use of the fly s eye result for @xmath20 and the chou - yang prescription for @xmath27 obtained at @xmath33 tev @xcite : @xmath34 in 1993 , nikolaev claimed that the akeno results should be corrected in order to take account of the differences between absorption and inelastic cross sections , leading to an increase of the published results by @xmath35 mb @xcite .",
    "all these cosmic ray estimates together with the accelerator results are displayed in fig 1 and show that , despite of the large error bars , we can identify two distinct set of estimations : one represented by the results of the fly s eye collaboration together with those by the akeno collaboration ; the other by the results of gaisser , sukhatme , yodh with those by nikolaev .",
    "taken separately these two sets suggest different behaviors for the increase of the total cross section .",
    "at this point it should be stressed that the fly s eye collaboration used the geometrical scaling hypothesis , which is violated even at the collider energy and so this result is certainly wrong .",
    "durand and pi asserted in ref .",
    "@xcite that their results presented in @xcite , and used by the akeno collaboration , should be disregarded due to a wrong approximation . on the other hand , to our knowledge , the results by gaisser , sukhatme , yodh and nikolaev have never been critized in the literature .",
    "but we must yet take account of the model dependence involved as discussed in @xcite .    for the above reasons we shall quantitatively investigate the statistical determination of possible lower or upper limits in the increase of the total cross section , associated with the results by akeno - fly s eye and nikolaev - gsy , respectively . to this end",
    "we consider two ensembles of data , above @xmath13 gev , defined by :    ensemble i : : :    @xmath2 accelerator data and @xmath1    accelerator data + akeno + fly s eye .",
    "ensemble ii : : :    @xmath2 accelerator data and @xmath1    accelerator data + nikolaev + gsy .",
    "for @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering , crossing symmetry is expressed by    @xmath36    and analyticity allows to connect @xmath10 and @xmath11 through two compact and symmetric formulas ,    @xmath37    @xmath38    where , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are analytic transforms relating real and imaginary parts of @xmath41ven ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43dd ( @xmath44 ) amplitudes , respectively .",
    "they are generally represented by integral formulas ( integral dispersion relations ) and in the case of one subtraction they are expressed by @xcite    @xmath45    \\sigma_{+}(s ' ) = \\frac{ref_{+}(s)}{s } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46    \\sigma_{-}(s ' ) = \\frac{ref_{-}(s)}{s } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the subtraction constant .    at high energies we can take the limit @xmath48 and in this case they are equivalent to derivative forms given formally by @xcite    @xmath49   \\sigma_{+}(s ) =   \\frac{ref_{+}(s)}{s } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath50   \\sigma_{-}(s ) =   \\frac{ref_{-}(s)}{s}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    operationally these expressions may be evaluated through the expansions @xcite :    @xmath51 \\sigma_{+}(s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath52 \\sigma_{-}(s ) \\right\\ } d\\ln s \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int \\left\\ { \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{3 } \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{d}{d \\ln s}\\right)^2 -   \\frac{1}{45 } \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{d}{d \\ln s}\\right)^4   - ... \\right ] \\sigma_{-}(s ) \\right\\ } d \\ln s   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with this approach , @xmath11 may be determined through suitable input parametrizations for the total cross sections . in this communication",
    "we shall use two different choices for these inputs :    @xmath53 donnachie - landshoff ( dl )    the donnachie - landshoff parametrization for the total cross sections are expressed by @xcite    @xmath54    where , originally , @xmath55 mb , @xmath56 mb , @xmath57 mb , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .    for this parametrization eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) reads    @xmath60s^{\\epsilon } + \\left[\\frac{(y - z)}{2}\\cot(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2 } ) - \\frac{(y+z)}{2}\\tan(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2})\\right]s^{- \\eta}\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath61s^{\\epsilon } + \\left[\\frac{(z - y)}{2}\\cot(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2 } ) - \\frac{(y+z)}{2}\\tan(\\frac{\\pi\\eta}{2})\\right]s^{- \\eta}\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that this choice implies    @xmath62    @xmath53 kang - nicolescu ( kn )    the parametrizations for the total cross sections under the possibility of a maximal odderon contribution are given by @xcite    @xmath63    and eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) give    @xmath64    @xmath65    in this case we have    @xmath66    so that if @xmath67 and/or @xmath68 then , asymptotically , @xmath69 .",
    "as referred to before , we shall consider several cases : for both parametrizations ( dl and kn ) we perform independent and simultaneous fits to @xmath10 and @xmath11 by considering the two ensembles i and ii , separately .    in the individual procedure we first fit the @xmath9 data through eqs .",
    "( 10 ) ( dl ) or ( 11 ) ( kn ) and then fit the @xmath0 data by letting free the subtraction constant @xmath47 only ; in the simultaneous procedure the subtraction constant @xmath47 is a free parameter in the overall fit to both quantities .",
    "the fits were performed through the cern - minuit routine .",
    "the results with the dl parametrization are shown in figs . 2 and 3 and the statistical information",
    "are displayed in table 1 .",
    "those with the kn parametrization in figs . 4 and 5 and table 2 .",
    "from tables 1 and 2 and figures 2 to 5 we are lead to the following main conclusions :      in general , the results with ensembles i and ii do not differ substantially and the cosmic ray information in ensemble ii ( nikolaev and gsy ) are not described in all the cases . certainly this is due to the small number of points and the large error bars as compared with the accelerator data and also to the choices for the parametrizations .",
    "however noticeable differences occur with the kang nicolescu parametrization ( figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the best statistical results are obtained through the simultaneous fits .",
    "for example , in the case of dl parametrization , @xmath70 ( simultaneous ) and @xmath71 ( individual for @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is expected since in the simultaneous case we have more statistical information ( degree of freedom ) .",
    "as commented before , @xmath9 and @xmath0 do not have the same status as physical quantities since the @xmath0 value is model dependent .",
    "therefore we understand that the simultaneous fit may led to erroneous predictions for @xmath9 in the asymptotic region ( underestimation ) .            from tables 3 and 4 ,",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath12 @xmath79 in 3 cases and the only exception is for individual fits with ensemble ii , for which @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this predicts a crossing with @xmath82 becoming higher than @xmath83 .",
    "however , in this case @xmath0 is not described as shown in fig .",
    "we conclude that our results do not favor the odderon possibility .",
    "we observe that a similar and interesting analysis , taking quantitative account of the cosmic ray information , has been presented in this workshop by carlos avila @xcite .",
