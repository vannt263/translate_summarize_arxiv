    "since the lifshitz - kosevich theory @xcite provided a basis for universal quantitative description of magnetic quantum oscillations , these effects became one of most popular experimental means of studying the fermi surface properties of metals @xcite .",
    "besides traditional metals , quantum oscillations of magnetoresitance ( shubnikov - de haas , sdh effect ) and magnetization ( de haas - van alphen effect ) have recently proved extremely useful in exploring more complex topical materials such as cuprate @xcite and iron - based superconductors @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , heavy fermion compounds @xcite , and organic charge - transfer salts @xcite . here",
    "we report on an experimental study of the high - field interlayer magnetoresistance of the layered conductor @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1mn[n(cn)@xmath1]@xmath3 , demonstrating the power of the sdh effect in exploring fermi surface properties of a quasi - two - dimensional correlated electronic system .",
    "the present compound belongs to the family of bifunctional organic charge - transfer salts , in which conducting and magnetic properties are formed by different electronic subsystems spatially separated on a subnanometer level .",
    "the electrical conductivity is provided by delocalized @xmath4 electrons of fractionally charged bets donors arranged in two - dimensional ( 2d ) sheets , whereas magnetic properties are dominated by localized @xmath5-electron spins of mn@xmath6 in the insulating anionic layers @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interesting , still not understood crosstalk between the two subsystems @xcite , the narrow , half - filled conduction band is a likely candidate for a mott instability @xcite .",
    "the material undergoes a metal - insulator transition at @xmath7k @xcite .",
    "the insulating ground state is very sensitive to pressure : under a quasi - hydrostatic pressure of about 1kbar it is completely suppresses , giving way to a metallic and even a superconducting state with @xmath8k @xcite .",
    "a thorough knowledge of the fermi surface and other basic properties of the normal - state charge carriers is certainly mandatory for understanding the interplay between the various instabilities of the normal metallic state . to this end",
    "we have carried out high - field magnetoresistance studies of @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1mn[n(cn)@xmath1]@xmath3 under pressure @xmath9kbar .",
    "this pressure drives the system in the metallic part of the phase diagram , however , not far away from the insulating domain .",
    "we have found sdh oscillations with two fundamental frequencies , indicating a fermi surface consistent with the predictions of the band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the oscillation behaviour suggests strong electron correlations which are considerably dependent on the inplane wave vector .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1mn[n(cn)@xmath1]@xmath3 were grown electrochemically , as described elsewhere @xcite and had a shape of small plates with characteristic dimensions of @xmath10mm@xmath11 .",
    "the largest surface of the plate was parallel to the highly conducting bets molecular layers , which is defined as the crystallographic @xmath12-plane .",
    "resistive measurements were done with a standard four - probe a.c .",
    "technique using a low - frequency ( @xmath13hz ) lock - in amplifier .",
    "two contacts were attached to each of two opposite sample surfaces with conducting graphite paste in order to measure the interlayer resistance .",
    "the magnetoresistance measurements were done in the temperature range @xmath14k in magnetic fields of up to 29 t generated by the 24mw resistive magnet at the lncmi - grenoble .",
    "a quasi - hydrostatic pressure of 1.4kbar was applied using the cu - be clamp cell with silicon oil as a pressure medium and with a manganin coil for pressure control .",
    "the samples were aligned with the normal to conducting layers ( crystallographic @xmath15-axis ) being parallel to the magnetic field .",

    "inset : close - up view of the oscillatory component of the field - dependent resistance normalized to the monotonic background : @xmath17 .",
    "the background @xmath18 was determined by a low - order polynomial fit to the as - measured resistance @xmath19.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ sdh ] shows the low - temperature interlayer resistance of a pressurized @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1mn@xmath3 crystal measured in a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers . on the background of a monotonic , almost linear magnetoresistance",
    "one can see prominent sdh oscillations .",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the oscillatory signal is presented in fig.[fft ] for two field windows , 12 to 15 t and 23 to 29 t . in both",
    "spectra the dominant frequency is @xmath20 t . in addition , a smaller peak is observed at @xmath21 t and , in the higher - field spectrum , at @xmath22 t , which is the second harmonic of @xmath23 .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath24 frequency is stronger at relatively low fields , @xmath25 t and can be seen by bare eye , for example , in the inset in fig.[sdh ] . at increasing the field its relative contribution decreases ; however , it is still present in the high - field fft spectrum in fig.[fft ] .",
    "k taken in the field windows @xmath26 t ( lower curve ) and @xmath27 t ( upper curve ) .",
    "two peaks at the fundamental frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath23 correspond , respectively , to the classical ( @xmath24 ) and mb ( @xmath29 ) orbits on the 2d fermi surface @xcite shown in the upper left corner.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the @xmath29 frequency reveals a cyclotron orbit area in @xmath30-space equal to the first brillouin zone ( bz ) area .",
    "this result is in full agreement with the band structure calculations @xcite , predicting a 2d fermi surface as shown in the upper left inset in fig.[fft ] .",
    "the corresponding cyclotron orbit in the extended zone scheme is shown in the upper right corner in fig.[fft ] .",
    "due to the inversion symmetry of the molecular layer , the band dispersion was predicted to be degenerate at the fermi level on the line z  m of the bz boundary @xcite . in that case",
    "only one fundamental sdh frequency @xmath23 would be expected .",
    "however , we clearly observe the frequency @xmath28 corresponding to an orbit occupying @xmath31 of the bz area .",
    "this is exactly the size of the @xmath24 orbit centered at point z of the bz boundary , see fig.[fft ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the band degeneracy is lifted , most likely due to a finite spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "the resulting fermi surface should consist of a closed part @xmath24 and a pair of open sheets extended along @xmath32 ( parallel to @xmath33 z line in fig.[fft ] ) .",
    "the large orbit @xmath29 is then a consequence of magnetic breakdown ( mb ) through the small gap between the different parts of the fermi surface",
    ". similar evidence of the mb effect were found on several well known @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x salts @xcite .",
    "the sdh spectrum in fig.[fft ] differs from that reported earlier for this compound at similar pressures @xcite . in the earlier experiment no @xmath28 and @xmath23 but , instead",
    ", very slow oscillations with the frequency @xmath34 t were found . while the absence of the @xmath24 and @xmath29 oscillations can easily be attributed to the higher temperatures and lower fields used in ref . ,",
    "the absence of the slow oscillations in the present experiment is most likely caused by a different pressurizing procedure . in the previous work",
    "the samples were cooled at ambient pressure and then a pressure of @xmath35kbar was applied at temperatures below 20k , using the he - gas pressure technique . during the ambient pressure cooling , a superstructure transition was detected at @xmath36k @xcite .",
    "this transition was proposed to give rise to small fermi pockets responsible for the slow oscillations . by contrast , in the present work we apply pressure already at room temperature , using the clamp cell technique .",
    "the pressure probably prevents the formation of superstructure and the associated reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "indeed , the characteristic transition feature found in the ambient - pressure @xmath37 cooling curves has not been detected under pressure .",
    "we now turn to quantitative analysis of the oscillations . generally speaking",
    ", the quasi-2d character of the electronic system may lead to strong violations of the standard lifshitz - kosevich ( lk ) theory , see , e.g. , refs .. however , if we compare the present oscillations with those observed on some other highly 2d , clean organic metals @xcite , their amplitude is relatively weak and the harmonic content is low . as will be shown below , the oscillations exhibit the conventional exponential temperature and field dependence .",
    "therefore , in the following we apply the conventional lk formalism described in detail in ref .. this approach has been proved to give reasonable results for other similarly anisotropic organic metals at not too high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we consider the relative amplitudes of the oscillations in the form @xcite : @xmath38 where the subscript @xmath39 labels the relevant orbit on the fermi surface , @xmath40 is the amplitude of the oscillations in conductivity normalized to the respective nonoscillating background , @xmath41 is the field- and temperature - independent prefactor and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the damping factors caused , respectively , by finite temperature , scattering , and mb effects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the sdh amplitude can be fitted by the lk temperature damping factor @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46t / k and @xmath47 is the effective cyclotron mass in units of the free electron mass @xmath48 . for a large argument of the @xmath49-function in eq.([rt ] ) the logarithmic plot of the ratio @xmath50 , known as the lk plot , should be a straight line with a slope proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "this is , indeed , true for both the @xmath24 and @xmath29 oscillations , as demonstrated in fig.[mass ] .",
    "fitting the slopes yields the cyclotron masses @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "( circles ) and @xmath54 ( squares ) .",
    "the amplitudes were determined by fft in the field window 14 to 17 t .",
    "the lines are fits by eq.([rt ] ) with normalized cyclotron mass values of 5.53 and 6.88 for the @xmath24 and @xmath29 oscillations , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the obtained values can be compared to the band masses estimated within a noninteracting electron model . to this end , we have carried out tight - binding band structure calculations based on the organic donor homos ( highest occupied molecular orbitals ) obtained by the extended hckel method @xcite . to estimate the energy dependence of the fermi surface area and thus the cyclotron mass , the calculations were done for different band fillings near the fermi level with a step of @xmath55 electron per bets donor .",
    "the resulting values are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "although these estimations are rather rough , they demonstrate that the real cyclotron masses are considerably enhanced , most likely due the many - body effects",
    ". the significance of electronic correlations would not be very surprising , since @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1mn[n(cn)@xmath1]@xmath3 is proposed to be a mott insulator at ambient pressure @xcite and at the given pressure , @xmath9 kbar , the compound is still quite close to the metal - insulator boundary .",
    "it should be noted that the present mass values , especially @xmath58 , are even higher than those reported for the similar @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x salts @xcite , which are also known for a strong mott instability @xcite .",
    "while the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is solely determined by the temperature damping factor @xmath42 , the field dependence is contributed by all three damping factors on the right - hand side of eq.([lk ] ) . the dingle factor taking into account the landau level broadening @xmath33 has the form @xcite :",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath61 is the dingle temperature .",
    "the dingle temperature is often associated with the scattering rate @xmath62 @xcite : @xmath63 .",
    "finally , the mb factors for the @xmath24 and @xmath29 oscillations are determined , respectively , by the probability amplitudes of bragg reflection or tunneling at the mb junctions @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath64 \\label{rmba}\\ ] ] and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the characteristic mb field .",
    "equations ( [ lk ] ) - ( [ rmbb ] ) can be used for analyzing the field dependence of the oscillation amplitudes .",
    "fig.[ab ] shows the amplitudes of both oscillatory components plotted against inverse magnetic field .",
    "the data points are obtained from fft spectra taken in 3t - wide field windows .",
    "the height of the @xmath28 peak becomes comparable with the fft background noise level above 20 t ; therefore , for this frequency only the data in the field range 12.8 to 20 t is presented .",
    "oscillations as a function of inverse magnetic field ; ( b ) the same for the @xmath29 oscillations .",
    "both amplitudes are measured in the same units .",
    "the lines are fits by eqs.([lk])-([rmbb ] ) , see text.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one readily sees from eqs.([rd ] ) and ( [ rmbb ] ) that @xmath67 has the same functional dependence on @xmath68 as the dingle factor .",
    "therefore , the dingle temperature and mb field can not be separately determined from the field dependence of the @xmath29 oscillations , which dominate our sdh spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath68-dependence of @xmath69 is rather weak as compared to the exponential behaviour of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this limits the accuracy of our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that it enables us to draw some important qualitative conclusions .    for fitting",
    "we first assume that scattering is momentum - independent and , thus , the dingle temperature is the same for both orbits . in this case , substituting the cyclotron masses determined above and performing an iterative fit of both @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74k and @xmath75 t .",
    "taking into account that , despite the heavier mass , the @xmath29 oscillations strongly dominate the sdh spectrum even at @xmath76 t , the obtained mb field seems to be much too high .",
    "indeed , in order to match the observed relation between the amplitudes , we have to assume an unreasonably large ratio of the prefactors in eq.([lk ] ) : @xmath77 .",
    "since the @xmath24 orbit constitutes approximately one half of the @xmath29 orbit ( see inset in fig.[fft ] ) , one would expect this ratio to be @xmath78 .",
    "of course , the ratio @xmath79 , being determined by the inplane momentum dependence of the fermi surface parameters , needs not be exactly 2 .",
    "nevertheless , a modification by more than two orders of magnitude looks highly unlikely .    a key to resolving",
    "the apparent controversy is in a proper consideration of the influence of many body interactions .",
    "if the latter depend on the inplane momentum , the above assumption of a common dingle temperature for both orbits is no longer valid .",
    "although the rigorous analysis is very difficult , fortunately , the consideration may be strongly simplified by taking into account compensation of the renormalization effects on the cyclotron mass and dingle temperature .",
    "for electron - phonon interactions such compensation was observed long ago on hg @xcite : the dingle factor @xmath43 was found to be independent of temperature despite a considerable @xmath80-dependence of the electron - phonon scattering ( see also ref . for a review ) .",
    "it has been shown theoretically @xcite that in a large field and temperature range the product @xmath81 can be approximated by the product of the bare cyclotron mass @xmath82 and dingle temperature @xmath83 in the absence of electron - phonon scattering . while the case of electron - electron interactions is less studied in this respect , martin et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the same compensation should hold for any inelastic processes , including the electron - electron scattering . turning to our compound",
    ", we note that the @xmath24 pocket of the fermi surface contains extended flat segments ( see inset in fig.[fft ] ) and hence has a pronounced nesting property .",
    "one can expect that electron correlations are particularly enhanced at the nesting wave vector .",
    "this is probably the reason for the unusually high effective cyclotron mass ratio @xmath84 as compared to the value @xmath85 typical of other @xmath0-type organic conductors @xcite .",
    "indeed , the other salts do not have such flat segments and the interactions are believed to be momentum independent @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , redo the analysis of the oscillations amplitudes in fig.[ab ] , substituting the bare cyclotron masses @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the dingle factor @xcite . with an additional condition that the prefactor ratio @xmath88",
    ", the fit yields a reasonably small value of the mb field , @xmath89mt and only slightly different dingle temperature values , 3.1k and 3.5k for the @xmath24 and @xmath29 oscillations , respectively .",
    "of course , the present analysis is far from being precise .",
    "an improvement can be achieved when more reliable band mass estimations based on advanced , first - principle band structure calculations are available .",
    "further theoretical and experimental studies are required for evaluation of the fermi surface properties entering the prefactors @xmath90 in eq.([lk ] ) for the oscillation amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , already now we can conclude that the behaviour of the sdh oscillations clearly reveals the importance of electron correlations in the present organic conductor .",
