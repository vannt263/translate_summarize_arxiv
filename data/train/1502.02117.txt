    "there is a renewed interest in using the radio technique for the detection of extensive air showers induced by ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "dedicated experimental initiatives such as codalema  @xcite , lofar  @xcite , aera  @xcite , lopes  @xcite and tunka - rex  @xcite , with instrumentation far superior to that used in the early days of radio detection , have stimulated an impressive progress in the field . as a result the possibility of using the radio technique , either as a complement to other techniques for the detection of extensive air showers , or even to design new uhecr detectors based on it , is now seriously considered  @xcite .    the serendipitous discovery of 16 fast radio pulses from air showers extending up to the ghz range with the first anita balloon born antenna system  @xcite came as a surprise .",
    "this system , operating with a frequency band between 200 and 1200mhz , had been originally conceived for detecting radio emission from neutrino interactions in the antarctic ice sheet .",
    "however , the detected emission was strongly polarized in the direction defined by the cross product of the geomagnetic field and the shower direction , which is characteristic of radio signals from air showers due to the current induced by the earth s magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations of these pulses showed recently that coherent emission can extend up to and above ghz frequencies @xcite in spite of simple dimensional arguments suggesting the contrary @xcite .",
    "this is because the varying refractive index of the atmosphere introduces a significant effect on the relative travel time of emissions originating from different locations .",
    "when these delays are accounted for , a cherenkov like ring can appear in which the signals from a large region of the shower arrive with little time delay and thus add coherently  @xcite .",
    "this angle is mostly determined by the refractive index at the shower maximum , simply because that is the region with more charge and current and hence contributing most .",
    "fourteen out of the sixteen detected pulses were reconstructed to be coming from distinct points on the polar ice cap and showed inverted polarity with respect to the other two .",
    "this was interpreted as clear evidence that they were detected after reflection on the polar ice cap .",
    "the reflection of the radio flashes introduces several new aspects to the calculation of pulses at the detector that have not been previously addressed .",
    "naturally reflection implies a reduction of the emission due to the fresnel coefficients .",
    "the relative time delays with respect to detection at ground level are also altered , since the pulses propagate upwards after reflection towards the top of the atmosphere along a decreasing refractive index profile .",
    "these effects need to be taken into consideration to interpret the events detected by anita and to evaluate the acceptance of experiments that rely on observing radiation induced by showers from mountain tops , balloon payloads  @xcite such as the next anita flight and eva  @xcite or from satellite payloads as proposed in sword  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we simulate and describe the properties of radio pulses emitted from extensive air showers after reflection off a surface .",
    "most of the calculations are performed in a configuration suited for a high altitude balloon flight over antarctica , however the developed methods can be applied to other reflective surfaces and different detector altitudes .",
    "we modified the zhaires code  @xcite to calculate the radio emission from air showers after reflection on a flat surface .",
    "we first describe the geometry and explain the assumptions made to adapt the program to calculate the reflected radiation . after this",
    "we generate a set of simulations to investigate the signal properties as a function of off - axis angle , frequency , zenith angle , and energy of the primary particle , and stress the importance of properly accounting for the fresnel coefficients in the reflection , as well as for the propagation of the pulses towards the top of the atmosphere . in the appendix we use a ray tracing code and a simplified model for the emission ( that displays the main features of the predicted radiation as has been justified elsewhere  @xcite ) , to confirm that the effect of curved light trajectories can be neglected .",
    "the appealing aspect of observing radiation of air showers after reflection is that a large atmospheric volume can be monitored with a single detector .",
    "therefore , the most interesting geometry is given by air showers that impact earth s surface at large zenith angles .    the basic geometry of the problem is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . we define a rectangular coordinate system with the @xmath0-axis pointing upwards in the vertical direction and the @xmath1 plane tangent to the earth s surface .",
    "the reflective surface will be approximated by this plane .",

    "the zenith angle of the shower , @xmath3 , is defined with respect to the @xmath4axis .",
    "we define the _ off - axis angle _ @xmath5 in fig .",

    "[ fig : geometry ] the detector is displayed in a special position such that it sees the reflected radiation which was emitted precisely along the direction of shower axis with @xmath7 .",
    "the altitude at which shower maximum ( @xmath8 ) is reached , @xmath9 , is also of relevance . besides determining the angle",
    "at which the emission is largest @xcite , it also sets the scale of distances the pulse has to travel to reach the detector , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively denote the distances from the origin of the coordinate system to shower maximum and to the detector .",

    "the contribution from each track element to the radio pulse at any given position and time is calculated in zhaires assuming the particle travels at a constant speed and in a rectilinear motion and also accounting for the travel times taken by the radiation to reach from each of the ends of the track @xcite . to calculate travel times in zhaires",

    "this global offsets induce unobservable phase shifts in the field at the detector .",

    "the comparison of the travel times for the straight and curved ray calculations already sheds light onto the validity of the straight ray approximation .",
