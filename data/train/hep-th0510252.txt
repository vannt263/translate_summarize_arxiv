    "in this paper , we construct interacting @xmath0 _ pair _ matrix models inside the _ compact _ @xmath1 matrix models .",
    "this is one solution of the author for the doubling problem of the degrees of freedom that the models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 have . to put it briefly , as the simplest solution , we will accept existence of two structures of the universe . by this assumption ,",
    "we find that the theories based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 are divided into two portions which have structure of completely the same fields .",
    "if each universe is viewed as an independent thing , they constitute multiplets of @xmath0 . of course , since we consider matrix models , there is another gauge symmetry for the @xmath7 matrices .",
    "einstein gravity is a low - energy effective theory , because it is not perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "if the energy scale is raised , many irrelevant operators ought to contribute .",
    "therefore , there is no definite promise that the unified theory at the fundamental scale is surely described with the riemannian geometry itself .",
    "so we would like to advance an argument paying attention to the ` analogy ' with the _ projective geometry_. in the author s viewpoint , the mathematics which the universe should possess in the fundamental scale is the geometry similar to the projective geometry . of course",
    "the projective geometries have been classified mathematically and there is no _ pure _ projective geometry that has the _ compact _ @xmath1 as its projective transformation group .",
    "our idea is that : ` with an analogy to the projective geometry in mind , we will take a look at the doubling problem . '",
    "fortunately , since the treatment of the _ information geometry _ is possible to the symplectic groups , there is a possibility that we can discuss the metric geometry in the space of matrix - eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary that the diffeomorphism is directly introduced into the action itself explicitly .",
    "the author can not say anything because opinions may vary from the researcher to the researcher .",
    "after all , however , all theories other than the standard model are still theories of conjecture now . therefore , as one trial to make a breakthrough in this situation , the author thinks that there may be an approach like this paper .",
    "today , the low - energy physics is described well by the standard model as a gauge theory . however",
    ", this model is incomplete because gravity is not included .",
    "therefore , the most important subject of current particle physics is to construct a consistent quantum theory incorporating all interactions .",
    "what has to be noticed is the method of formulization for the construction of the unified theory .",
    "traditionally , physics has used the perturbative formulation willingly . however , the construction of the theory along the line of perturbative formulation is essentially defective in the sense that physical quantities are represented by the asymptotic series .",
    "the final theory must be constructed by the non - perturbative formulation from the beginning . then",
    ", what kind of mathematical expression will the non - perturbative theory be described by ?",
    "probably , it will be good to recall the constructive definition of the field theory by wilson in order to answer this .",
    "the essence is that the space - time is seen from a viewpoint of combinatorial analysis .",
    "another example can be seen in the twistor theory by penrose . that the theory is described along the line of combinatorial method means that the physical objects have countability .",
    "therefore , the simplest method to describe nature will be the representation which uses matrices .",
    "from such reason , we pay attention to the _ matrix model _ as the formulization of the theory . in recent years",
    ", many studies have been made on matrix models as the constructive definition of string theory .",
    "however , the author thinks that there is no need to relate the matrix model to string theory alone because of the reason mentioned above .",
    "of course , considering a success that the topology expansion of the @xmath8d gravity was able to be expressed with the double scaling limit of the @xmath9 expansion of the matrix model , it is reasonable to suppose that a corresponding matrix model exists because @xmath10d superstring theory can be actually expressed in the form of @xmath8d supergravity . on the other hand , however , there is a fact that the matrix model is also useful in different fields like loop quantum gravity .",
    "in fact , the matrix model can fill the role of the constructive definition of non - commutative geometry . in a broad sense",
    ", it is playing a linguistic role for describing physics .",
    "smolin proposed a matrix model based on the real jordan algebra @xmath11 as one candidate of the unified theory  @xcite .",
    "his model has been founded on the exceptional lie group @xmath12 and the trilinear form , which is the invariant of @xmath12 , was adopted for the construction of the model .",
    "however , the author pointed out that the complex structure can not be introduced into his model , and attempted to use the simply connected _ compact _ exceptional lie group @xmath1 instead  @xcite , @xmath13 invariants further  @xcite . a relevance to the finslerian - like geometry has been also mentioned .",
    "the further development of this direction is expected . ] .",
    "the _ cubic form _ , which is the @xmath1 invariant , plays an important role in constructing the model based on @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown that the matrix chern - simons type theory can be derived as the result even when exceptional lie group @xmath1 is used .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that _",
    "the compactness condition _ of @xmath1 implies _ the postulate of positive definite metric _ of our model .",
    "this previous model based on @xmath1 will be introduced briefly in the next section .",
    "we would like to point out that the method using single exceptional jordan algebra is applicable only to the @xmath12 and @xmath1 and @xmath13 are large , the introduction of spaces like the freudenthal @xmath14-vector space @xmath15 is indispensable . ] .",
    "the following summarizes the definitions of some groups of type @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 here , @xmath18 represents the _ trilinear form _ , and @xmath19 represents the _",
    "cubic form_. we can not define @xmath1 using trilinear form only .",
    "@xmath1 must be defined by cubic form .",
    "the cubic form is very different from the trilinear form , and they are given explicitly in the appendix .",
    "the complex exceptional jordan algebra @xmath20 is the complexification of the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath11 .",
    "the complexification of the exceptional lie group should not be confused with that of the exceptional jordan algebra .    as an advantage to use @xmath1 instead of @xmath12 ,",
    "there are the following points other than the introduction of the complex structure mentioned above . for example , in @xmath1 model , there is no necessity of the change of variables in order to make the theory of the chern - simons type .",
    "the chern - simons type action can be directly derived from the invariant on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , there is an advantage of containing @xmath21 in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 is interesting also from the viewpoint of phenomenology . as mentioned in the previous paper  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath1 is considered to be a good group in the sense that the final theory must contain the standard model .",
    "furthermore , what must not be forgotten is that the compactness condition of @xmath1 automatically implies a positive definite metric for our model  @xcite .",
    "what is called _ the postulate of positive definite metric _ is , from the viewpoint of our model , merely an immediate consequence of the fact that our universe is _",
    "compact_.    on the other hand , there are problems in the model based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 .",
    "main problems are two : one is the doubling problem of the degrees of freedom , and another is the interpretation problem of the fermion . in this paper ,",
    "the author would like to propose one interpretation about the doubling problem of the degrees of freedom .",
    "another one problem about the fermion is that the anticommuting c - numbers can not be seen apparently when the action was expanded and expressed by the elements of @xmath20 . in the stage of the complex exceptional jordan algebra",
    "@xmath20 itself before the expanding by coefficients of the elements , there is a possibility of realization of the fermion commutation relation in @xmath20 algebraically as has been pointed out by rios  @xcite .",
    "however , when we take the position that the action is constructed by using the invariant of a certain group , the cubic form expanded by fields is described by the scalars only and there is no anticommuting c - number .",
    "therefore , we can not define the formal functional integral to the fermion . of course this problem will not arise if we suppose the existence of the complex exceptional jordan _ super_-algebra .",
    "however , the jordan _",
    "super_-algebra is extremely artificial algebra .",
    "the author is still hesitant about taking the plunge into that direction .",
    "one possibility is to assume that the approach of the quantum hall effect is useful .",
    "another possibility is that the definition of the fermion itself needs to be reexamined .",
    "the reader might think that @xmath1 is the group for phenomenology and that it is not a symmetry for matrix models which deal with the space - time together .",
    "the author , however , thinks that this view is incorrect .",
    "the comparison of the supersymmetry between field theories and matrix models is a good example to illustrate this point .",
    "usually , when we consider the field theory , the space - time is given from the beginning . in this case , therefore , the supersymmetry means the exchange of bosons for fermions . in the matrix model , however , the space - time itself is embedded into the matrix .",
    "therefore , if a certain matrix model possesses the supersymmetry , it is more precise to say that the symmetry which exchanges the space - time for the matter exists .",
    "that is , the meaning of supersymmetry is upgraded in the matrix model .",
    "therefore , an important point to emphasize is that _ if the @xmath1 symmetry exists behind the matter it must also exist behind the space - time_.    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     after being argued about the @xmath12 model  @xcite by smolin , and our model  @xcite based on @xmath1 , ramond argued about a similar concept from the viewpoint of supergravity  @xcite .",
    "ramond paid attention to the coset @xmath22 of @xmath12 in his paper .",
    "of course it is also possible to consider this coset in smolin s @xmath12 model . in order to realize it , what is necessary is just to add the following constraint to the fields @xmath23 in smolin s @xmath12 model . @xmath24",
    "it is known from of old that jordan type algebras can define the projective spaces ( see appendix  [ kp_m ] . ) . because there is no _ pure",
    "_ projective space which contains the graves - cayley projective plane @xmath25 ,",
    "the research of this space itself is very interesting in the sense that it is the highest dimensional space employing @xmath26 .",
    "however , the projective transformation group of @xmath25 is not @xmath12 but @xmath27",
    ". therefore , in order to make the theory ` closed ' , we have to construct the @xmath27 model by using the _ cubic form _ instead of the _ trilinear form_.    now , because we consider _ compact _ @xmath1 , of course , different analyses of the theory from smolin or ramond are needed .",
    "the point to observe is the relevance between the cubic form , which is the @xmath1 invariant , and the geometry .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paper , the existence of an unknown geometry similar to the projective geometry can be seen off and on behind the freudenthal multiplication and the cubic form .",
    "we will take up this point a little in the section [ geometry ] .",
    "the number on which we focus attention in this paper is the complex graves - cayley algebra @xmath28 .",
    "the first scholar to pay attention to real - octonions was graves .",
    "however , it was not accepted in people because of the non - associativity .",
    "afterward , the real - octonions were rediscovered by cayley ( see @xcite for example . ) .",
    "complex _ graves - cayley algebra @xmath28 , which we employ in our model , is the complexification of this graves - cayley algebra @xmath26 .",
    "we use the complex - octonion as the fundamental number .",
    "the introduction of the complex - octonions is extremely essential when dealing with the exceptional lie groups of type @xmath1 , @xmath29 , @xmath13 .",
    "we would like to note that this @xmath28 contains the quaternion field in four - fold as a clue which solves the doubling problem of the _ compact _ @xmath1 .",
    "this idea is the basics of this paper .",
    "the greatest advantage to make a complex - octonion result in four quaternions is that they own the associativity and it becomes easy to deal with them .",
    "this is not to say that the essential mathematics behind our universe is not non - associative algebra .",
    "the author thinks that the non - associative algebra offers the key to an understanding of the universe . as the result of that",
    ", the picture of two internal structures of the universe is automatically produced as seen in this paper .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review our previous model based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 and point out the problems which this model possesses .",
    "the problems discussed here are common to all the models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 .",
    "then , in section 3 , our strategy for solving the doubling problem of the degrees of freedom is discussed . in accordance with the ` analogy ' to the projective geometry",
    ", we will adopt a solution which follows the klein s erlangen program . in section 4 , a concrete example of our idea",
    "is presented . as a consequence",
    ", we result in the picture of interacting @xmath0 _ pair _ universe .",
    "this picture is applicable to all the models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 , which may be not only matrix models but also field theories . in section 5 , this picture is applied to our previous matrix model .",
    "the resulting theory is the interacting bi - chern - simons model .",
    "this result is interesting because it resembles the bi - chern - simons gravity  @xcite . in section 6",
    ", the author would like to dare to mention about the unknown geometry .",
    "although an argument here is open issue and completely incomplete , it offers the way of one approach toward the unknown geometry .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusions and discussions .",
    "one answer of the author to the doubling problem is stated . also , it is pointed out that the same prescription is applicable to the split - quaternions @xmath30 formally . in the appendix ,",
    "elementary descriptions of the complex exceptional jordan algebra @xmath20 are presented , which are needed for this paper . if the reader has a great interest in the exceptional linear lie groups further , a series of excellent reports presented by i.  yokota ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) are recommended .    today",
    ", many researchers are content with the studies of five string theories , or the studies of effective theories of m - theory .",
    "the researcher who grope for the possibility of a new theory is extremely few .",
    "however , string theories are the theories asymptotically expanded around the specific backgrounds of what is called the unknown m - theory , and the @xmath31d supergravity is a ` low - energy ' effective theory of the m - theory .",
    "one can never restore the original theory from the theory which is represented by the asymptotic expansion because of the lack of one - to - one correspondence .",
    "also , one can never restore the original theory from the effective theory which is not renormalizable because of the information loss .",
    "therefore , these are the theories which are far from the true theory .",
    "that is , the final theory must be the theory which has more physical degrees of freedom .",
    "since it is not known how the future is opened , the author hopes freer standpoints of the researchers are allowed a little .",
    "in this section , we briefly review our previous model  @xcite based on the simply connected _ compact _ exceptional lie group @xmath1 .",
    "an effective action of the matrix string type can be derived from this model , as mentioned in the previous paper .",
    "recently , castro has pointed out that there is a correspondence between this model and chern - simons branes in the large @xmath32 limit and that it is invariant under volume - preserving reparametrizations of the @xmath33d world - volume which leave invariant the nambu - poisson brackets  @xcite .    in the previous paper",
    ", we adopted a following definition for the simply connected _ compact _ exceptional lie group @xmath1 on the occasion of the construction of our model : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the _",
    "cubic form_. the second condition , @xmath36 , is added to the definition in order to make the group _",

    "the notation @xmath44 $ ] denotes the _",
    "weight_-1 anti - symmetrization on indices .",
    "the degrees of freedom of this model live in @xmath45 .",
    "the specific components of @xmath46 are written as follows : @xmath47 here , the @xmath48 are complex numbers , and the @xmath49 are elements of the complex graves - cayley algebra .",
    "after decomposing the action in terms of the variables defined in  ( [ eq : components-1 ] ) , we get @xmath50 the first term of this action is identical to the matrix chern - simons theory . what should be noted here",
    "is that : although the action was originally constructed from the _ algebraic _ invariant on the @xmath1 mapping ( i.e. the cubic form ) , it automatically has a chern - simons type form .",
    "therefore , it is quite likely that one of the properties of the theory based on @xmath1 is that it is _ topological_.    if we introduce the following notation : @xmath51 these quantities enable us to write the equations of motion of this theory as @xmath52 + [ \\vec{\\varphi}_{0i } , \\vec{\\varphi}_{0j } ] + [ \\vec{\\varphi}_{ii } , \\vec{\\varphi}_{ij } ] \\",

    "namely , this model has a property that a chern - simons type action is coupling with other fields automatically .",
    "it constitutes one multiplet based on @xmath1 as a whole .",
    "this model possesses the following symmetries : the global @xmath1 symmetry resulting from the cubic form , the gauge symmetry resulting from @xmath41 , the cycle mapping @xmath58 with respect to the fields , and the matrix translation symmetry with respect to the diagonal parts of the fields .",
    "in addition , an important point to emphasize is the existence of the _ compactness condition _ of @xmath1 , @xmath36 .",
    "as has been discussed in the previous paper  @xcite , due to this compactness condition , one invariant under the @xmath1 mapping is introduced into the theory .",
    "@xmath59 this invariant is , in general , a complex number .",
    "the expression  ( [ eq : invariant ] ) indicates that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "what is especially important is the case of @xmath62 as follows : @xmath63 the crucial point to observe here is that _ this invariant satisfies a positivity condition _ : in general @xmath64 , and it vanishes if and only if @xmath65 .",
    "although this invariant is the quantity defined on the product space @xmath45 , the resulting structure is , in a sense , quite similar to that of the physical hilbert space .",
    "since the internal rotational symmetry caused by @xmath1 mappings exists , this space is , as it were , the hilbert space which is embedding a kind of spinor structure . in the matrix model ,",
    "the space - time itself is embedded into the matrix .",
    "therefore , if we take the position that the physical hilbert space is the _ product space _ composed of two parts @xmath20 and @xmath42 , what is called _ the postulate of positive definite metric _ is merely an immediate consequence of the fact that our universe is _",
    "compact_.    moreover , this model has some interesting features .",
    "for example , the theory expanded around one of the classical solutions of this model has a effective action similar to the matrix string theory .",
    "however , there are two main problems in the models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 , as mentioned before .",
    "one is the doubling problem of the degrees of freedom , and another is the problem concerning how to include anticommuting c - numbers in the theory .",
    "especially the former problem is crucial .",
    "because the cubic form itself has very interesting properties , we have an impulse to discuss them immediately .",
    "however , even if we advance the analysis of the @xmath1 model being left the doubling problem , we will have to return to this problem finally after all .",
    "therefore , in analyzing the theory , we consider that tackling about this doubling problem first is the top priority .",
    "the following is devoted to one answer of the author to this problem .",
    "in this section , we will discuss our strategy to solve the doubling problem .",
    "we proceed with our arguments on the premise that the true theory have the _ compact _ @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "it seems that this is a valid supposition because @xmath1 is not inconsistent with the standard model . under this supposition , we narrow down the answer with the highest probability as the actual universe for this problem , taking account of the existing circumstantial evidences and the demands which is considered to be appropriate . that is , the ` elimination ' is adopted .",
    "we consider that what remains at the end will probably be near the truth , after erasing undesirable things . although the picture of the universe which we finally choose in this paper is the @xmath3 pair universe , some considerations which performed up to the final conclusion are briefly introduced here .    _",

    "@xmath72    as a solution of the doubling problem , the simplest idea is that : ` we naively acknowledge that there are two universes , and assume that we live in only one side ' , like a parallel - brane world . given that this idea is correct , the structure of @xmath46 must be divided into two equal portions . however , the method of this division is not unique .",
    "various possibilities exist unfortunately .",
    "a method , which are thought of immediately from the inside of those many candidates , is the following : @xmath73 namely , this is an idea of dividing @xmath20 merely into real part and imaginary part .",
    "after such kind of division , we have a feeling that we would like to think that real part @xmath74 and imaginary part @xmath75 express the two different universes which consist of , for example , the sets of d - instantons and anti - d - instantons , respectively .",
    "however , we hesitate to consider the above division for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , if we divide like above expression , we had better construct a theory based on the @xmath27 which has a half degrees of freedom from the beginning , by using the following definition : @xmath76 because @xmath27 is the projective transformation group of @xmath25 , it is true that the research of the models based on the @xmath27 is very interesting .",
    "however , the mathematical meaning of _ the postulate of positive definite metric _ in physics is lost in that case . as discussed in the previous paper  @xcite ,",
    "the postulate of positive definite metric is directly derived from the compactness condition of @xmath1 .",
    "it is considered to be an immediate consequence of the fact that our universe is _ compact_.",
    "the author can not throw away this beautiful property .",
    "secondly , we have to remind ourselves of the reason why we used the compact @xmath1 . as also discussed in the previous paper  @xcite , the greatest reason why we used the _ compact _",
    "@xmath1 is that there was the necessity of introducing the complex structure into the theory from the beginning in order to include the standard model .",
    "however , when the universe is divided like an above expression , the individual universe of @xmath74 and @xmath75 does not contain the imaginary unit ` @xmath77 ' in the inside , respectively .",
    "this defect is fatal .",
    "it is not clear anymore for what purpose the model was originally constructed using the _ compact _ @xmath1 .",

    "one important subject which had been argued in our previous paper  @xcite was resolved by this division .",
    "in this section , we consider matrix models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 from the viewpoint of a field - decomposition @xmath3 introduced in the previous section . for simplicity , at the outset , a toy model based on the @xmath1 is considered . however , even if other more complicated actions based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 are considered , the following argument is basically the same .",

    "now , although the classical solution of this simple model may be considered , it is not carried out here .",
    "the argument which we would like to have in this section is a generalization common to all models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 .",
    "it is the following when the matter which the above naive example shows is summarized .",
    "* by the division into two fundamental figures @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we can decompose the action based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 into three parts : @xmath111 , @xmath112 which have the completely the same structure of the fields , and @xmath113 which represents the interactions of two fundamental figures . *",
    "given that the expectation value of one fundamental figure is vanishing @xmath114 in the classical limit , the classical theory is only the other action @xmath111 with the constraints .",
    "* therefore , when considering the classical theory , the argument can be closed in only one universe , but when considering the quantum theory , we have to take the existence of the two universes into account .",
    "now , from an analogy with the projective geometry as discussed in the previous section ( [ _ consideration _",
    "@xmath78 ) , we would like to demand that @xmath89 and @xmath90 possess a transformation group independently .",
    "in other words , we would like to demand that @xmath111 and @xmath112 themselves possess a symmetry individually . in the following",
    ", we will see that our fundamental figures @xmath89 , @xmath90 are filling this demand . the resulting symmetry is the @xmath115 .",
    "it can be comprehended clearly by using _ yokota mapping _ @xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath111 and @xmath112 themselves are the @xmath115 matrix models .",
    "this is ensured by the following _ yokota mapping _ @xmath5 . in this subsection ,",
    "based on the review @xcite , we introduce the yokota mapping @xmath5 briefly ( see reference @xcite for details . ) .",
    "we consider the @xmath116 complex quaternionic jordan type algebra @xmath117 with the jordan multiplication , the inner product and the hermitian product .",
    "the _ yokota mapping _ is defined as a mapping @xmath118 by @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 is the @xmath123 unit matrix .",
    "if this is represented by using our notation ( [ eq : f - component ] ) concretely , the result is the following : @xmath124 here , we should notice that the real part of this @xmath116 matrix is expressed only by the fields of @xmath89 , and the imaginary part is expressed only by the fields of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the restriction of yokota mapping @xmath5 to the _ real figure _ @xmath125 ( or _ the imaginary figure _ @xmath126 ) induces a @xmath127-linear isomorphism @xmath128 .",
    "this is important .",
    "now , before the significant properties about the yokota mapping @xmath5 defined by ( [ eq : yokota ] ) are shown , two mappings ` the @xmath129-conjugation ' and ` the @xmath130-conjugation ' are defined .",
    "the @xmath129-conjugation is merely the complex conjugation with respect to ` @xmath77 ' which we have denoted as @xmath131 until now .",
    "@xmath132 it is more convenient to use this mapping @xmath129 , without using the asterisk@xmath133 , in the following arguments .",
    "another @xmath130-conjugation is defined for the first time here , and is the following complex conjugation with respect to ` @xmath134 ' .",
    "@xmath135 in the appendix ( [ ssec_e4 ] ) , we have mentioned that @xmath134 plays a role of the imaginary unit .",
    "of course if @xmath129 and @xmath130 act on a matrix , it means that they act on all elements of that matrix .",
    "the following is an example , @xmath136 by using these , the important properties about the _ yokota mapping _",

    "* when we consider the quantum theory , another structure of the universe must also be taken into account and the theory based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 must be used .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paper  @xcite , one of the purposes of our study is to pursue the geometry of the universe .",
    "it is known from of old that jordan type algebras @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) , which are @xmath198-hermite matrices , can define _ pure _ projective spaces ( see appendix  [ kp_m ] ) .",
    "also , it is known from of old that one can proceed the same argument as the projective geometry by using the ` _ split - octonions _ ' .",
    "a good review has been discussed by catto  @xcite . in the case of the _ compact _ @xmath1 , however , the structure is a bit different .",
    "the _ compact _",
    "@xmath1 does not possess the structure of usual projective geometry .",
    "however , we might be able to construct a deformed geometry .",
    "for example , that might be an unknown non - associative geometry deriving from the non - associativity of the octonion . at least , it is quite likely that it is a kind of non - desarguesian geometry .",
    "so , we would like to see about the relevance between our model and the geometry a little here from the viewpoint of the ` _ matrix model _ ' . a more detailed argument",
    "will be discussed in elsewhere .",
    "the idea about which we have argued in this paper was what assumes two fundamental figures @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as internal structures of space - time from ` analogy ' with the projective geometry .",
    "at first , because the matrix models about these fundamental figures have @xmath0 symmetry , we have an impulse to embed the projective space @xmath199 into @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) immediately . however , this is unrealizable with the difference of the trace unfortunately .",
    "@xmath200 therefore , we have to grope for other possibilities .",
    "first of all , it is more desirable to exist as the geometry of the whole theory which @xmath46 including both satisfies , rather than the geometry which @xmath89 and @xmath90 satisfy separately .",
    "so , it seems better to proceed with our considering along the line of the ` analogy ' with the projective geometry as before . because the projective geometry is powerful , one assumption that ` the geometry behind physics is similar to the projective geometry , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to _ fundamental figures _ in the projective geometry ' itself provide us a vague image of the universe .",
    "now , because @xmath89 differs @xmath6 $ ] from @xmath90 in phase , we can regard them as intersecting orthogonally .",
    "therefore , these @xmath89 and @xmath90 do not have a common set originally .",
    "we should not overlook the fact that @xmath89 and @xmath90 will not be associated without coupling with the gauge symmetry ( @xmath41 etc . ) .",
    "in other words , they are related each other by constructing the matrix model using a product space @xmath201 for the first time .",
    "this means that the existence of each point itself is the cause of the connection between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , because , in many matrix models , the diagonal parts of @xmath7 matrices are regarded as space - time points usually . if it is seen from the viewpoint of the projective geometry , this suggests that each point of the space - time is playing a role of ` _ cut _ ' or ` _ center of projection_. ' for example , if we regard each point as a _ cut _ , the diagonal of the matrix will correspond to ` _ point range_. ' in this case , an image as shown in ( figure  [ fig_range.eps ] ) is obtained .",
    "this is an image which _ global _",
    "@xmath1 probably pictures . also , if we regard each point as _ center of projection _",
    ", we can say that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are in a kind of ` _ perspective relation _ ' ( figure  [ fig_center.eps ] ) .",
    "this is an image which _ local _ @xmath1 probably pictures .",
    "the matrix model which we have considered until now is _ global _ @xmath1 matrix models .",
    "however , if possible , the author thinks that _ local _ @xmath1 matrix models are more promising .",
    "it is a future subject whether the model of _ local _ type can be made .",
    "we will now see the idea of ` analogy ' with projective geometry a little further in the following subsection .",
    "one of the reasons why we believe that the cubic form @xmath202 is more essential than the trilinear form @xmath203 is because it is a kind of determinant .",
    "now , as an easiest example , let us naively regard @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 as the ` points ' in a certain unknown space , and advance our arguments on the ` analogy ' with the projective geometry .",
    "since one line @xmath207 can be defined by deciding two points in the projective geometry , we will assume naively the freudenthal multiplication defined as a operation between two points to be that line @xmath207 : @xmath208 usually , the ` _ incidence _ '",
    "@xmath209 of the projective geometry is a certain relation ( operation ) defined between a point and a line .",
    "if @xmath210 , it says that the point @xmath177 is _ not _ on the line @xmath207 , and if @xmath211 , it says that the point @xmath177 is on the line @xmath207 .",
    "so , if we put @xmath212 , the _ incidence _",
    "@xmath213 is as follows : @xmath214 namely , the _ cubic form _ corresponds to the _ incidence_.    now , how is the situation of @xmath210 and @xmath211 understood in this case ?",
    "usually , the determinant of the complex exceptional jordan algebra is defined as follows using the cubic form , @xmath215 by the way , usually , the term ` determinant ' will immediately remind us the scalar density as the invariant volume element of the space . the universe we consider here",
    "is based on @xmath1 , and we are assuming that our model is connected with a certain unknown geometry .",
    "so , let us assume that the volume density in that geometry is given by the determinant as usual . when it does so , if the model is invariant under the @xmath1 mapping , naturally it is desired that the invariant volume element of corresponding geometry to be also invariant under the @xmath1 mapping .",
    "this means that the following relation is concluded with respect to the determinant : @xmath216 now , let us represent @xmath217 as @xmath218 using arbitrary @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , and substitute this into ( [ det-1 ] ) here .",
    "if the coefficient of @xmath222 is compared , we result in that above expression ( [ det-1 ] ) is equivalent to the following expression ( [ det-2 ] ) by @xmath223 , instead of ( [ e6_def1 ] ) . ] .",
    "@xmath224 therefore , because ( [ det-1 ] ) and ( [ det-2 ] ) include the equivalent information in themselves , if @xmath225 has the meaning of the volume density in the unknown geometry , it is natural to consider that the cubic form @xmath226 is also expressing a certain ` volume . '",
    "thus , let us assume naively that the cubic form is representing the area surrounded by the three points .",
    "in this case , ( [ det-2 ] ) can be interpreted as the expression representing the _ volume - preserving _ ( figure  [ fig_volume1.eps],figure  [ fig_volume2.eps ] ) .",
    "that is , although it moves from each point to another point by @xmath1 mapping , it means that the area surrounded by three points does not change .",
    "actually , these are being multiplied by the gauge invariants ( @xmath41 etc . ) .",
    "that is , @xmath227 exist infinitely .",
    "therefore , we can imagine the single huge network floating in a internal space , as a picture of the universe being made by the _ compact _",
    "@xmath1 . and",
    "if the idea of decomposing @xmath204 into fundamental figures @xmath89 , @xmath90 which intersect orthogonally is right , this huge polyhedron will possess double coating structure ( figure  [ fig_network.eps ] ) .",
    "since this is a network of fundamental figures , it is a network of internal structures different from the space - time points .",
    "furthermore , this network is not a solid .",
    "it is the ` living ' huge network which can be moved by @xmath1 mapping as shown in ( figure  [ fig_volume2.eps ] ) .",
    "also , this reminds us of a kind of the diffeomorphism .",
    "furthermore , the special interesting case is @xmath228",
    ". we might be able to call this case as the _ topological _ case because of @xmath229 . in this case",
    ", a line is mapped into a line because the volume is vanishing ( figure  [ fig_line1.eps],figure  [ fig_line2.eps ] ) .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath211 .",
    "this fact suggests strongly that an unknown geometry which is quite similar to the projective geometry exists behind the cubic form because the geometry which investigates invariant property under the projective transformation is the projective geometry . also , this reminds us of the transition of the state vector ( i.e. _ ray _ ) in the quantum mechanics",
    "of course for arbitrary @xmath230 , if @xmath231 , it means that all @xmath204 are on the same line such as ` beads ' ( figure  [ fig_beads.eps ] ) .",
    "the above is one of the reasons to come to believe that a certain projective geometrical correspondence exists behind the model .",
    "the image of the matrix models based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 is probably the set of ` beads ' floating in a internal space , because the lie algebra @xmath232 of @xmath1 can be defined as follows , @xmath233 there is a possibility that the _ topological _ case have a close relation to the lie algebra @xmath232 .",
    "the author can not say having clarified for the moment , although groped about unknown geometry for a long time .",
    "detailed research is a future subject .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a solution of the doubling problem which has been left in the previous paper  @xcite . as a solution",

    "this result is interesting because it resembles the bi - chern - simons gravity ( see  @xcite as an example . ) .",
    "finally , the doubling problem of the degrees of freedom is avoidable on the classical level by hypothesizing that we belong to one side of two structures of the universe . from our viewpoint , the structure of our universe is completely closed in the theory based on @xmath0 at the classical level .",
    "when we consider the quantum theory , another structure of the universe must also be taken into account and the theory based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 must be used . in a sense ,",
    "the idea itself of dividing into two universes argued in this paper is not a new view .",
    "the view of the parallel - brane world or the multi - brane world discussed in the phenomenology in recent years is a concept just like having argued here .",

    "@xmath235 therefore , the author are thinking seriously that : ` although the argument might be able to be closed in only one universe when we consider the classical theory , but we have to take the existence of the two universes into account when we consider the quantum theory . '",
    "however , when we think in this way , it turns out that another possibility also exists .",
    "let us discuss about this point below .",
    "since we are considering the model based on the _ compact _ @xmath1 , of course , the universe as the whole is _",
    "compact_. however , if that is held , it will be thought that not each universe needs to be compact .",
    "namely , the following condition should just be maintained at worst .",
    "* the probability is conserved inside the whole which united two universes .",
    "that is , we think that the probability does not need to be conserved inside one universe itself .",
    "since @xmath236 is a compact group , it means that the above condition says that @xmath236 can be abandoned . in order to solve the doubling problem",
    ", we used the _",
    "klein s erlangen program _ as our policy and finally reached the picture of the interacting pair universe .",
    "however , once we reached this picture , we had inconsistency of necessarily not needing _",
    "erlangen program_. that is , if they constitute the compact @xmath1 as a whole , an interpretation that the two universes do not need possessing the independent transformation group respectively exists .",
    "let us consider one concrete example .",
    "although we made a complex - octonion result in four quaternions @xmath237 , the method of dividing this into four split - quaternions @xmath30 also exists .",
    "the formal procedure is the same as that of what argued in this paper .",
    "the definition of our split - quaternions @xmath30 is the following : @xmath238 we must note that for @xmath239 , even if @xmath240 , there is a possibility that @xmath241 .",
    "also , we must note that @xmath242 may not be concluded .",
    "when we use @xmath30 , it is more natural to divide each universe into two portion further . therefore , we must deal with four portions of the universe simultaneously .",
    "although such each universe is quite similar to the ads - space @xmath243 , it is distinct from the ads - space . it is because _ compact",
    "@xmath1 should not contain @xmath244 .",
    "the picture of the universe in this case is apparently strange because although each universe has a structure which is very near the _ negative curvature _ , they are compact as a whole due to the compactness condition of @xmath1 . from our viewpoint in this paper , in other words , we can say that : ` when considering the classical theory , the argument can be closed inside the open universe , but when considering the quantum theory , we have to use the whole universe which is compact . '",
    "physically , such picture is extremely interesting .",
    "the further research is one of the most exciting subjects .    as said at the beginning , einstein gravity is a low - energy effective theory , because it is not perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "if the energy scale is raised , many irrelevant operators ought to contribute .",
    "therefore , there is no definite promise that the unified theory at the fundamental scale is surely described with the riemannian geometry itself . in the author s viewpoint , the mathematics which the universe should possess in the fundamental scale",
    "is the geometry similar to the projective geometry . about this point ,",
    "a few were discussed in the previous section .",
    "although the _ pure _ projective geometries have been classified mathematically , it is quite likely that we can construct a deformed geometry such as the non - desarguesian geometry or the non - associative geometry . from the viewpoint of the projective geometry",
    ", the riemannian geometry should be understood inside the space where the transformation group acts .",
    "therefore , in the matrix model , a possibility of realizing the diffeomorphism inside the space of matrix - eigenvalues ( i.e. the information space ) is high .",
    "because the symmetry which the action of the matrix model has can be seen corresponding to a kind of transformation group , the action itself may be unrelated to diffeomorphism . fortunately , since the treatment of the _ information geometry _ is possible to the symplectic groups , there is a possibility that we can discuss the metric geometry in the space of matrix - eigenvalues certainly .",
    "also , it may be interesting to examine the interacting bi - chern - simons model .",
    "the grope of the geometry is an important future subject .",
    "now , what must not be forgotten is that another problem exists .",
    "as has been pointed out , there is a problem how to deal with the fermion in the model using jordan algebras .",
    "the naive idea which introduces anticommuting c - numbers into the theory is that we use the complex exceptional jordan _ super_-algebra instead of the complex exceptional jordan algebra .",
    "however , the jordan _",
    "super_-algebra is extremely artificial algebra .",
    "the author is still hesitant about taking the plunge into that direction .",
    "the author can not abandon a concern that our definition of the fermion itself is not probably perfect .",
    "at least , it is quite likely that ` the prescription of the formal functional integral to the fermion of integrating with the anticommuting c - numbers is provisional handling and finally the right way of handling exists independently ' .",
    "this point will be argued someday .",
    "the consideration which we have so far performed is mainly about @xmath38 .",
    "the technical discussions using the gauge symmetry about the @xmath7 matrix have not been performed .",
    "therefore , we can perform various analyses further .",
    "they are future subjects .",
    "we are groping for the new directivity of physics .",
    "of course it may be unrealistic to expect some big result in such a trial immediately .",
    "however , compared with our previous paper  @xcite , we think that we are moving forward in contents a little .",
    "the author thinks that the essential problem is that we do not have the mathematics which describe our universe properly , rather than the problem of physics itself .",
    "for example , there is a problem of whether the model based on _ compact _ @xmath1 includes the information about a certain fundamental object .",
    "as discussed in the previous paper , the model based on @xmath1 can have an effective theory which is similar to the string theory .",
    "however , the author thinks that the fundamental object might not be the string , because the open universe can have a fundamental object which is different from the string .",
    "this point will be discussed on another occasion .",
    "i would like to thank y.h .",
    "ohtsuki and i.  yokota for encouragements .",
    "i am also grateful to y.  machida for inviting me to the 12th and the 13th numazu meeting ( march 9 - 11 , 2004 and march , 8 - 10 2005 , shizuoka , japan ) .",
