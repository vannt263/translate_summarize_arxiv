    "flexoelectricity is a coupling between elastic deformation and electrostatic polarization in a liquid crystalline medium . in general , a splay or bend deformation of the nematic director leads to an electrostatic polarization , which can be observed as a macroscopic dipole moment of the liquid crystal .",
    "conversely , an applied electric field induces an electrostatic polarization , which leads to a combination of splay and bend distortions in the nematic director . since its discovery in 1969 by meyer  @xcite",
    ", the flexoelectric effect has drawn great interest because of its possible applications  @xcite in strain gauges , transducers , actuators , micro power generator and electro - optical devices .",
    "there have been many experimental and theoretical studies to determine the flexoelectric coefficients of nematic liquid crystals  , using a range of different approaches . for typical calamitic ( rod - shaped ) liquid crystals , the splay and bend flexoelectric coefficients are in the range of 320 pc / m .",
    "however , in recent experiments , harden et al .",
    "@xcite found that bent - core liquid crystals have a surprisingly large bend flexoelectric coefficient , up to 35 nc / m , roughly three orders of magnitude larger than the typical value . with this large bend flexoelectric coefficient",
    ", bent - core liquid crystals may be practical materials for converting mechanical into electrical energy .    for theoretical physics ,",
    "a key question is how to explain the large flexoelectric effect found in bent - core nematic liquid crystals , so that it can be exploited for technological applications .",
    "our conjecture is that the large flexoelectric effect is a statistical phenomenon associated with nearby polar phase . near a polar phase ,",
    "a nematic liquid crystal is on the verge of developing spontaneous polar order , and hence any deformation of the director should induce a large polar response . to test this conjecture , we would like to build a model with nematic and polar phases , and determine the behavior of flexoelectric effect as a function of temperature above the nematic - polar transition . in this paper",
    ", we begin the study by investigating the splay flexoelectric effect in a system of uniaxial pear - shaped molecules . in a subsequent paper",
    ", we will investigate the more complex case of bend flexoelectricity in bent - core liquid crystals , as in the experiments .",
    "to study the splay flexoelectric effect , we generalize the lebwohl - lasher lattice model of nematic liquid crystals  @xcite . in the original lebwohl - lasher model ,",
    "each lattice site @xmath0 has a spin @xmath1 , which represents the local nematic director , with the symmetry @xmath2 . in our generalization , the spins represent the orientations of pear - shaped molecules , which do not have that symmetry .",
    "for that reason , the interaction between neighboring spins includes three terms  one term favoring nematic order , another term favoring polar order , and a third term that couples polar order with splay of the nematic director . with this interaction ,",
    "we find a phase diagram with isotropic , nematic , and polar phases , as illustrated in the snapshots of fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] .",
    "the nematic phase has a flexoelectric effect , which increases as the system approaches the polar phase .",
    "thus , this calculation demonstrates explicitly that the flexoelectric effect is a collective , statistical phenomenon , which is strongest near the transition to a phase with spontaneous polar order .",

    "iv we present a mean - field theory for this model , and compare the simulation results with the mean - field approximation . finally , in sec .  v we discuss and summarize the conclusions of this study .",
    "in this study , our goal is to simulate the splay flexoelectric effect in a system of uniaxial pear - shaped molecules . for these simulations ,",
    "we construct a lattice model that can represent both nematic and polar order . in this model , the local molecular orientation at lattice site @xmath0",
    "is represented by a unit vector @xmath3 .",

    "if the system has polar order , then the molecular orientations tend to point in a particular direction ; i.e. there is a nonzero order parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the first legendre polynomial .",
    "note that the system can have nematic order without polar order , but it can not have polar order without nematic order .    the lattice hamiltonian must have four terms : one term that favors nematic order , one term that favors polar order , one term that gives a coupling between polar order and an applied electric field , and a final term that gives a coupling between polar order and splay of the nematic director .",
    "the term favoring nematic order can be written simply as @xmath9 , summed over all pairs of neighboring sites @xmath0 and @xmath10 , as in the lebwohl - lasher model  @xcite .",
    "the term favoring polar order can be written even more simply as @xmath11 , again summed over all pairs of neighboring sites @xmath0 and @xmath10 , as in the heisenberg model of magnetism .",

    "the bent - core liquid crystal should be close to a polar phase , with order in the transverse dipole moments of the molecules . as a result , there should be large correlated volumes of molecules , leading to a high susceptibility to an applied field , which induces both polar order and bend .",
