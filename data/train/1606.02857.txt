    "the recent experimental results of the totem collaboration on the measurements of the differential cross - section of elastic scattering @xmath1scattering at small @xmath0 at the energy in the center of mass system @xmath2 tev @xcite have demonstrated strong deviation of the nuclear amplitude from a simple exponential dependence .",
    "those measurements have high precision and significance of the above effect is at the level of seven standards .",
    "we discuss here the role of the real part for the explanation of this deviation and confirm the possibility of emerging @xmath0 dependence of the ratio of real to imaginary parts @xmath3 of the elastic scattering amplitude at small @xmath0 values in case of the unitarity limit saturation at the asymptotical values of the energy @xmath4 .",
    "the problem has a long story .",
    "a knowledge of the real part of the elastic amplitude is particularly important due to its sensitivity to the possible dispersion relation violation resulting from violation of the polynomial boundedness @xcite and to the new physics related , e.g. to the non - local interactions resulting from presence of the fundamental length and/or existence of an extra internal compact dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , this knowledge is rather limited nowadays : the experimental data provide information for the forward scattering in the coulomb - nuclear interference ( cni ) region only @xcite , while it could play an important role in a wider region of the transferred momentum @xmath5 variation .",
    "it should be noted that the real part of the scattering amplitude has a peripheral dependence on impact parameter in the both cases of black - disk or unitarity limit saturation ( cf .",
    "it means that if the asymptotics corresponds to one of the above limits the function @xmath3 has a nontrivial @xmath5 dependence at @xmath4 .",
    "the black disk limit for the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation ( in case the pure imaginary amplitude ) is @xmath6 and unitarity limit is unity .",
    "the `` black disk model '' implies that the amplitude in the impact parameter representation is equal to @xmath6 till some value of the impact parameter @xmath7 and it decreases at @xmath8 .",
    "similar form of this dependence is valid for the case of unitarity limit saturation which is twice as much as the black disk limit .",
    "it should be noted , that the asymptotic equipartition @xmath9 does not define the `` black disk model '' since the same relation is being valid in various cases .",
    "the forward scattering observables are the definite integrals over impact parameter and it is quite evident , that an integration over impact parameter does not allow an unequivocal reconstruction of an initial integrand .",
    "the above equipartition at @xmath10 has been obtained in @xcite for a gaussian exponential dependence of the profile function saturating unitarity limit at @xmath11 , and this function has nothing to do with the black disc model .",
    "the dominance of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is almost commonly accepted in the region of diffraction cone , but the real part should not be neglected in the whole region of the transferred momentum variation since it is related through the dispersion relations to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude and therefore it is not an arbitrary function .",
    "we assume the validity of dispersion relations and , more generally , validity of the anylyticity , unitarity and polynomial boundedness and then restore the real part of the scattering amplitude using the derivative analyticity relations @xcite .",
    "those local relations have been obtained in the limit of @xmath4 .    the following scenario for construction of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude",
    "can be adopted .",
    "namely , the procedure is used : we calculate imaginary part of the scattering amplitude using unitarization scheme based on rational representation where an input is taken to be a pure imaginary and real part of the input is neglected at this first stage . at the second stage the real part of the amplitude",
    "is restored from the imaginary one on the basis of the derivative analyticity relations .",
    "this stage is proposed to be called as `` analytization '' by analogy with the term unitarization .",
    "the final amplitude includes both imaginary and real parts and is consistent with unitarity ; the limit @xmath12 implies that @xmath13 at @xmath4 and fixed impact parameter .",
    "normalization of the amplitude @xmath14 is determined by the unitarity relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the elastic and inelastic overlap functions , respectively and @xmath17 . as it will be shown below , the limit @xmath13 at @xmath4 at any fixed value of @xmath18 results from its proportionality to the inelastic overlap function @xmath19 which tends to zero at @xmath20 at any fixed value of the impact parameter .",
    "till the measurements at the lhc energies , the elastic scattering data have been consistent with the bel picture , i.e. when the protons interaction region becomes blacker ( increase of absorption ) at the center , relatively edgier and larger",
    ". the analysis of the data on elastic scattering obtained by the totem at the energy @xmath21 tev has revealed definite hints on the presence of the new mode in strong interaction dynamics @xcite called as antishadowing , reflective or resonant mode .",
    "it constitutes a gradual transition to the so called rel picture , i.e. when the elastic interaction starts to be reflective ( i.e. the corresponding scattering matrix element becomes negative ) at the center and simultaneously appears to be relatively edgier , larger and blacker at its periphery .",
    "asymptotic picture can then be described as a black ring , its possible appearance has been mentioned in @xcite .",
    "there are phenomenological models which can successfully describe the existing experimental data ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the appearance of the reflective mode is registered under reconstruction of the elastic amplitude , elastic and inelastic overlap functions in the impact parameter representation @xcite .",
    "it is turned out that the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation is monotonically reaching the black - disk limit @xmath6 from below .",
    "it allows one to assume a monotonic increase with energy in case of saturation of the unitarity limit by the elastic scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation .",
    "we follow here an opportunity related to the unitarity limit saturation .",
    "it was supported by the analysis of the experimental data on elastic scattering in the impact parameter representation @xcite .",
    "the recent luminosity - independent measurements at @xmath22 tev @xcite have confirmed an increase of the ratio @xmath23 , which is another , but indirect , indication on the reflective scattering mode presence .",
    "discussions of the possible interpretations of this mode based on the quark - gluon structure of the hadrons can be found in @xcite .    to restore the real part of the scattering amplitude we use derivative analyticity relation in the impact parameter representation .",
    "the most simple and straightforward derivation of this relation in the impact parameter representation has been given recently in @xcite under assumption of the dominating imaginary part of the scattering amplitude : @xmath24 the amplitudes of @xmath1 and @xmath25 are taken to be equal .",
    "this implies an absence of the crossing - odd contributions like the ones generated by the odderon at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such relation ( integrated over @xmath18 ) has been used in @xcite for analysis of the energy dependence of the parameter @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the obtained energy dependence has been found to obey the khuri - kinoshita theorem @xcite , i.e. it decreases like @xmath28 if @xmath29 at @xmath4 .",
    "here we extend the above consideration to the case of @xmath30 .    to construct imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation we use the rational form of unitarization",
    ", its origin can be traced back to the papers of heitler @xcite , and assume first that the input function @xmath31 is pure imaginary , i.e. use the replacement @xmath32 .",
    "it gives a pure real elastic scattering matrix element @xmath33 and pure real scattering amplitude with the same replacement @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding relations have the forms @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 we introduce the function @xmath38 which is determined as a solution of the equation @xmath39 , i.e @xmath40 . under this",
    ", we suppose that the function @xmath41 monotonically increases with the energy at any fixed impact parameter @xmath18 . this increase is supposed to be a power - like one .",
    "such a dependence leads to rising behavior of the total cross - section like @xmath42 at @xmath4 and unitarity saturation , i.e @xmath43 at any fixed @xmath18 when @xmath44 . the observed increase of @xmath45 can be considered as an argument in favor of the supposed dependence of the function @xmath41 .",
    "when the function @xmath31 becomes greater than unity , the reflective scattering mode starts to appear @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of this mode is a peripheral distribution of the inelastic production probability over the impact parameter with maximum reached at @xmath46 .",
    "the peripheral form becomes more and more prominently peaked with an energy increase .    in our model ,",
    "we use factorized form for the @xmath47 and @xmath18 dependencies of the function @xmath41 with an explicit power - like energy increasing dependence of @xmath41 and linear exponential decrease of this function with the impact parameter @xmath18 ( i.e. with an energy - independent slope ) . the corresponding asymptotical dependencies @xmath48 and @xmath49 , while @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "now , we can calculate @xmath51 according to eqs .",
    "( [ darb ] ) and ( [ fsb ] ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 ^ 2}\\ ] ] is the inelastic overlap function .",
    "probability distribution of the inelastic processes over impact parameter is @xmath54 .",
    "the real part of the scattering amplitude @xmath55 can be calculated as the fourier - bessel transform of @xmath56 : @xmath57 we have already mentioned that at asymptotical energies inelastic overlap function @xmath58 has a very prominent maximum at @xmath46 and tends to zero at @xmath4 and @xmath11 . such peripheral form with a peak at @xmath46",
    "allows one to obtain an approximate relation @xmath59 since for the function @xmath41 the factorized dependence on the variables @xmath47 and @xmath18 with power - like energy dependence was taken , we have @xmath60 it should be noted , that due to eq .",
    "( [ der ] ) , the following relations take place in the case of the unitarity limit saturation : @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63    there are no such relations for the case of the black disk limit saturation , when the inelastic overlap function is not peripheral at @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , we note that saturation of the black disk limit can be modelled by the following rational representation @xmath64,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath65 has similar to the function @xmath66 dependencies on @xmath47 and @xmath18 .",
    "( [ darb ] ) can be used then for the restoration of the real part in the case of the black disk limit saturation .    and , finally , for the real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath67 we have in the case of the unitarity limit saturation at @xmath4 : @xmath68 and @xmath69 the latter relation results from the asymptotical peripheral dependence of @xmath58 with sharp maximum at @xmath46 .",
    "thus , at asymptotic energies , the ratio @xmath70 would depend on the both variables @xmath47 and @xmath0 and should not be a constant over @xmath0 .",
    "this takes place in the region of the small values of @xmath0 also and conforms to the conclusion on existence of the nontrivial @xmath0 dependence of the function @xmath70 in the cni region @xcite .",
    "the reason can be traced to the different forms of the impact parameter dependence corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "the aim of the present note is to consider the case of unitarity saturation at @xmath4 . at small values of @xmath0",
    "the bessel functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be approximated by the linear over @xmath5 exponential functions with _",
    "different slopes_. this means that @xmath73 at small-@xmath5  and @xmath20 can , in principle , be approximated by the two exponential functions .",
    "the function @xmath71 is sharply peaked , it can be correlated with the inelastic processes contribution .",
    "the zeros of the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 would lead to the dips in @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that those simple forms of the real and imaginary part contributions are valid at the asymptotical energies only .",
    "but , this fact serves as a motivation for an extension of the simple exponential dependence by adding another linear exponent instead of changing linear exponent into a nonlinear one @xcite .",
    "another motivation for such parameterization can be based on the account of spins of colliding protons @xcite . since a long time fits to @xmath73 with several exponential functions",
    "are known to be successful at lower energies .",
    "thus , despite that the lhc energies are not the asymptotic ones , the above asymptotic results to the lhc energies might happen to be at least in a qualitative correspondence with the recent totem result on the @xmath75 deviation of the @xmath73 at small-@xmath5 from a simple linear exponential dependence over @xmath0 @xcite .    to be a more quantitative , we have performed a simple fit to the totem data using sum of two linear exponential functions .",
    "the aim of this fit is to illustrate existence of a working alternative to the parameterization with a quadratic exponential function .",
    "this form should be considered as a deficient one owing to this equality of slopes it implies .",
    "such conclusion results from the derivative dispersion relations for the amplitude slopes @xcite , the new experimental results on the amplitude phase @xcite and the above discussion . ] @xmath76used in @xcite .",
    "the following function : @xmath77 has been used .",
    "the resemblance with the results described above is a qualitative one and a similar form might also be motivated by an account for the spin amplitudes - scattering description . ] .",
    "the description with two linear exponents appears to be successful with the following values of the fitting parameters : @xmath78",
    "mb / gev@xmath79 , @xmath80 mb / gev@xmath79 and @xmath81 gev@xmath82 and @xmath83 gev@xmath82 .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is 0.46 .",
    "the table data from @xcite have been used and their description is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the restoration scenario of the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude has been considered in the case of the unitarity saturation at @xmath4 .",
    "the unitarity saturation is indicated by the recent experimental data at the lhc energy range .",
    "the real part of the amplitude appears to have a different @xmath5-dependence compared to its imaginary part in this particular case .",
    "the difference in the dependencies of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude means presence of a nontrivial @xmath5dependence in the amplitude phase and can be correlated with the recent totem results on the measurements of @xmath85 in the low - t region at @xmath2 tev .",
    "it evidently also results in the @xmath5-dependent ratio of the real to the imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "numerical fit with sum of two linear exponents having different slopes has been performed to illustrate consistency of the experimental results with additivity of the contributions into the differential cross - section @xmath73 as it was discussed above .",
