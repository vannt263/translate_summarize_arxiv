    "as a consequence of the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe , a lot of dark energy candidates have been proposed along recent years . modified gravity theories has become one of the most popular candidate , since it provides a way to understand the problem of the dark energy and the possibilities to reconstruct a gravitational theory capable to reproduce late time acceleration , and even the inflationary phase ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath0 theories are the simplest ones , since they consist in a generalization of the hilbert - einstein action to a more complex function of the ricci scalar , s = d^4x  . [ 1.1 ] here the coupling constant is as usual given by @xmath1 , while @xmath2 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "the field equations corresponding to the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) are obtained by the variation of this action with respect to the metric tensor @xmath3 , what yields @xmath4 = ^2t^(m ) _  . [ 1.2 ] here the subscript @xmath5 denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "here we are interested to study flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metrics , ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2_i=1 ^ 3dx^i2  . [ metric ] hence , modified flrw equations are obtained through the field equations ( [ 1.2 ] ) , @xmath7\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath8 .",

    "hence , any cosmology can be reproduced by the appropriate action ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this manuscript",
    ", we focus on the study of a subclass of modified gravities , the so - called viable @xmath0 gravities , as they accomplish some indispensable conditions to be considered realistic candidates to describe the universe evolution .",
    "this kind of @xmath0 gravities are usually described by actions of the type @xmath11 , which basically represents hilbert - einstein action plus an additional term that should affect only at cosmological scales , while at local scales , general relativity is recovered .",
    "viable gravities are able to satisfy this constraint , as well as avoids large instabilities in the presence of matter distributions , and the anti - gravity regime , by the appropriate form of the function @xmath12 ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , these theories are capable to reproduce the effects of dark energy , and even inflation .",
    "note that both equations in ( [ 1.3 ] ) are written in such a way that @xmath12-terms are on the matter side .",
    "we can define an effective energy density for the extra @xmath12-terms , so that the first flrw equation in ( [ 1.3 ] ) can be rewritten for the kind of actions in terms of the cosmological parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 _",
    "f(r)=(-3hf_rr-3h^2f_r )  .",
    "[ 1.4 ] here , we have assumed @xmath11 .",
    "then , the first friedmann equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) takes a simple form , with two fluids contributing to the scale factor dynamics .",
    "in addition , the continuity equation @xmath16 for a perfect fluid with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath17 yields @xmath18 .",
    "hence , for a particular @xmath12 , the corresponding cosmological evolution can be obtained through equations([1.3 ] ) , and the continuity equation .",
    "then , under these circumstances , the @xmath12 term contributes to the dynamics of the scale factor , and it is capable to reproduce both accelerating epochs of the universe evolution . here we will focus on the study of one model of this kind of viable modified gravities , proposed by hu and sawicki in ref .",
    "@xcite , and whose action is given by , f_hs(r)=-r_hs  , [ 1.8a ] where @xmath19 are free parameters and @xmath20 .",
    "the next sections are devoted to the study of the cosmological evolution for this model , specially during the dark energy epoch , and in the future .",
    "we will also study the behavior of their scalar - tensor counterpart , where the phase space is explored .",
    "this analysis is based on the study performed in ref .",
    "in this section , we explore the cosmological evolution for the hu - sawicki model . for convenience , we express the equations ( [ 1.3 ] ) in terms of the redshift @xmath21 instead of the cosmic time @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the value of the scale factor at the present time @xmath25 , such that the current epoch corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "then , we can fit the current values of the cosmological parameters using the observational data @xcite , where @xmath27 with @xmath28 and the matter density , @xmath29 , while the matter fluid is considered pressureless ( cold dark matter and baryons ) , @xmath30 . then , by setting the initial conditions , the corresponding cosmological evolution can be obtained through the hubble parameter in terms of the redshift and the future evolution can be explored ( with @xmath31 ) . here",
    ", we analyze the evolution of the effective eos @xmath32 , which is defined as w_eff==-1-=-1 +  . [",
    "2.5 ] for simplicity we redefine the hubble parameter as @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 , while the initial condition on the first derivative @xmath35 can be fixed by assuming that our model mimics @xmath36cdm at @xmath26 , which basically gives @xmath37 .",
    "let s now analyze the @xmath38 model in ( [ 1.8a ] ) , assuming @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are dimensionless parameters , and a power of @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , the evolution of the eos parameter ( [ 2.5 ] ) is plotted with respect to the redshift for the initial conditions that mimic @xmath36cdm model at @xmath26 . in spite of the evolution of the eos parameter",
    "is quite similar to the @xmath36cdm model for positive redshifts , the universe enters in a phantom phase in the future ( negative redshifts ) , where the eos parameter turns out less than @xmath42 , and it oscillates close to @xmath43 as shown in more detail in fig .  [ fig1a ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the evolution of the cosmological parameters @xmath44 with respect to the redshift is plotted , where @xmath45 tends to dominate completely the universe in the future .",
    "note that the viable modified model considered here ( [ 1.8a ] ) produces some oscillations along the cosmological evolution .",
    "in general , the transition to the phantom epoch occurs for this class of models , as pointed out in @xcite , which does not imply the existence of a singularity in the future .",
    "nevertheless , a singularity may occur along the whole evolution , since the scalar potential presents a pole for a finite value of the scalar field .",
    "however , the singularity may be excluded from the range of interest by a particular choice of the free parameters .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 gravity is equivalent to a kind of brans - dicke theory with a null kinetic term , and a scalar potential , ( see for example , @xcite and references therein ) , s = d^4x  . [ 3.1 ] where the scalar field and the potential are related with a particular @xmath0 action by , = f_r(r )  , v((r))=f_r(r )  r - f(r )  . [ 3.3 ] let s reconstruct the corresponding scalar - tensor theory for the particular model considered in the previous section . by the expressions ( [ 3.3 ] ) , the corresponding relation @xmath46 for the model ( [ 1.8a ] ) is easily obtained , _",
    "hs=1++  , [ 3.7 ] where we have assumed @xmath41 in ( [ 1.8a ] ) , as in the previous section .",
    "then , the scalar potential ( [ 3.3 ] ) yields , v_hs()=r_hs  , [ 3.8 ] hence , the scalar - tensor representation is not uniquely defined , but the potentials exhibit two branches , which in principle do not affect the cosmological evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , but it may influence the behavior of the phase space .",
    "in addition , the model introduces a boundary condition on the value of the scalar field , being @xmath47 , a limit where both branches of the potentials converge , and where the first derivative of the potential exhibits a pole , which induces a sudden singularity ( see ref .",
    "note that there is a direct correlation between the behavior of the scalar field and the evolution of the eos parameter as can be shown comparing figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig1a ] with fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : the eos parameter presents some oscillations , specially for negative redshifts around the phantom barrier , while the evolution of the scalar field also oscillates at negative redshifts .    let us now analyze the phase space @xmath48 for this model in vacuum . for simplicity , we assume vacuum flrw equations , so that by combining flrw equations ( in the scalar - tensor equivalence ) , the following equations are obtained , = -2h^2+v ( )  , =  .",
    "[ 3.9 ] which yield , =  .",
    "[ 3.10 ]    this equation describes the phase space for a particular scalar potential .",
    "[ fig4 ] the phase space for the model ( [ 1.8a ] ) with the same free parameters assumed above .",
    "then , it shows that regardless of the choice of initial conditions , the behavior of the hubble parameter tends to a stable point , close to zero , where some tiny fluctuations are observed .",
    "other viable models have a similar behavior , where tiny differences between the models are observed when the future evolution of the eos is studied , as pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "here , we have analyzed the future evolution of a particular viable @xmath0 gravity model , @xcite .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the effective eos enters into a phantom stage in the present or near future , while the cosmological evolution , similarly to @xmath36cdm model at @xmath26 , is well reproduced for small redshifts , where we have imposed some particular conditions in order to fit the model with the observational constraints . on the other hand",
    ", the transition to the phantom phase does not imply directly the occurrence of a future singularity , since the hubble parameter and its first derivatives remain finite .",
    "in addition , the scalar - tensor counterpart of the @xmath0 model shows a well behavior of the phase space , at least when @xmath47 , which is the case for small redshifts as shown in fig .",
    "nevertheless , this does not prevent that a cosmological singularity , induced by the pole of the scalar potential , may occur in the past .",
    "however , for large redshifts , one expects that modifications may be negligible , so that the singularity may be avoided .",
    "a deeper study on this issue should be done in future works . moreover , the possibility of a _ little rip _ , a phase where the strength of the expansion would be comparable with some bounded systems as the solar system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , seems to be far to occur in viable @xmath0 gravity , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . hence",
    ", viable modified gravities have still a strong support to be considered as a serious candidate to dark energy .",
