    "it has long been known that there is a tight correlation between far - infrared ( fir ) and radio luminosities in star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "this correlation has been shown to hold over almost five orders of magnitude for galaxies , not just at local redshifts @xcite , but also for redshifts from 0 to 2 including various types of galaxies with different morphological structures and luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the underlying physical reason behind the fir - radio correlation is not fully understood ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is thought to be due to the ongoing star - formation  dust absorbs light from the massive young stars and emits it in the fir band , while galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) electrons accelerated in supernova remnants emit in radio band .",
    "consequently , the fir - radio correlation has been proven to be a powerful tool for determining star - formation rates @xcite .    despite numerous studies that have claimed that the fir - radio correlation is relatively stable @xcite ,",
    "there are also several contemporary observations both at low and high - redshifts that question this . for example",
    ", some observations have shown that the tight linear fir - radio correlation varies in the case of galaxies in rich clusters @xcite , but also for distant starburst galaxies @xcite and distant sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) , which were found to be radio brighter with respect to the local fir - radio correlation @xcite .",
    "though it is generally considered @xcite that this correlation does not evolve with redshift , the value measured in the few samples where radio - loud active galactic nuclei have been excluded was found to be more than @xmath0 lower @xcite .",
    "however , what is obvious is the scatter of data around this correlation . this scatter is thought to originate in part from 1 ) young active galactic nuclei in which the radio activity has begun only recently @xcite , 2 ) from much stronger magnetic fields in starbursts than is suggested by the minimum energy estimate @xcite , or 3 ) from ongoing interactions between galaxies @xcite .",
    "the departure from the typical fir - radio correlation and excess of radio emission was also found in the case of so - called `` taffy '' systems ( interacting galaxies with strong synchrotron - emitting gas bridge between them ; * ? ? ?",
    "as suggested by @xcite this excess in non - thermal emission is probably due to particle acceleration in large - scale shocks in bridges between interacting galaxies @xcite . in this work",
    "we expand on this and point out that such departure from the typical fir - radio correlation may not only be the case for bridges and `` taffy '' systems , but from cosmic rays accelerated in tidal shocks in the galaxies themselves .",
    "shock waves that arise during galactic interactions ( mergers and close fly - bys ) have been known to impact the star - formation history of interacting galaxies by triggering star - formation and even leading to a starburst phase ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it was pointed out that tidal shocks that accompany these interactions can give rise to a population of tidal cosmic rays ( tcrs ) .",
    "this can have a potentially significant impact on nucleosynthesis of light elements such as lithium @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the presence of such cosmic - ray population will also result in an enhanced radio emission @xcite . as a result",
    ", the fir - radio correlation will be impacted .",
    "this may possible cause the dispersion seen in the relationship and have important implications for star - formation measurements .    in this work",
    "we explore the effects that the presence of tidal shocks might have on the fir - radio correlation in interacting star - forming galaxies and test this hypothesis on a small sample of interacting systems .",
    "the fir - radio correlation is described using the @xmath1 parameter @xcite as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the continuum radio emission flux at 1.4 ghz per frequency such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the radio spectral index , positive in vast majority of sources .",
    "@xmath6 is the rest - frame fir dust emission flux .",
    "@xcite analyzed the sample of 1800 _ iras _ galaxies and measured this value to be @xmath7 with a dispersion of 0.25 dex .",
    "both normal star - forming spirals and merger - induced luminous infrared galaxies were included in their sample .    in this work",
    "we revisit the idea of galactic interactions being ( in part ) the source of the large dispersion of the relationship . as galactic interactions",
    "can give rise to tidal shocks in the interstellar medium of interacting galaxies , they can consequently produce a cosmic - ray population , in addition to normal gcrs , resulting in excess radio emission .",
    "such an enhancement in radio flux would cause the dispersion of the fir - radio correlation , which would especially be significant at higher redshifts with increased rate of galactic interactions compared to low - redshift universe .    unlike gcrs",
    ", cosmic rays accelerated in tidal shocks due to close galactic fly - bys would result in an excess of non - thermal emission in gamma - rays and radio band that is not immediately accompanied by the corresponding increase in star - formation rate @xcite . therefore the most promising way for identifying the presence of tcrs is to observe galaxies in early ( mid ) merging stages ( merging stage 3 according to * ? ? ?",
    "* classification scheme ) .",
    "one would also anticipate additional heating of the gas and especially dust in tidal shocks ( as was observed in interacting systems ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compared to what would normally be expected due to the ongoing star - formation , again , provided that the system is observed in an sufficiently early merging stage . with these additional sources of non - thermal and thermal radiation",
    "it is clear that the fir - radio correlation would be affected such that @xmath8  a typical fir - radio parameter will not be equal to that same parameter @xmath9 for a system where there is a presence of additional cosmic - ray population ( such are for example tcrs ) . more specifically ,",
    "if there are tidal shocks and a tcr population present , then the expected parameter would be q_ir^t=. the @xmath10 is the additional fir flux of dust coming from tidal shock heating , while @xmath11 is the additional radio flux from tcr electrons . observing that @xmath12 and assuming that the effects of tidal shocking are a small perturbation already existing effects ( i.e. that @xmath13 ) we will have that in general @xmath14 .",
    "however , as the interaction between galaxies progresses , how would we expect this parameter to change ?      at the very early stages of interaction , we expect tidal shocks to form in the ism and start heating the dust and gas .",
    "dust can be heated in collisions with gas or by shock uv radiation , causing it to radiate thermally in infrared .",
    "however , this will also result in destruction of dust due to sputtering processes .",
    "the time - scale of destruction of dust in shocks goes from few thousand years to tens of millions of years @xcite , depending mainly on the grain size , strength of the shock and density of the ambient medium . on the other hand typical cosmic - ray acceleration timescale in supernova remnants",
    "is of the order of lifetime of the remnant , being a few @xmath15 yr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for large - scale shocks considered here",
    ", cosmic - rays will be accelerated as long as the tidal shock propagates , which can be of the order of gyrs .",
    "thus , during the first few thousand to million years of galactic interaction , we can consider that there is enhanced thermal emission of heated dust and gas over what is typically expected of non - interacting systems , without enhanced non - thermal emission of freshly accelerated cosmic - rays . as a result",
    ", we can expect a non - thermal radio emission dominated by the already present gcr population , and thermal emission with an added contribution from tidal shock heating , leading to @xmath16 .",
    "the enhanced overall spectral index will also change , becoming shallower ( harder ) @xmath17 , compared to a typical observed value @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a shallower radio spectral index indicates a more dominate thermal component ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and vice versa .",
    "we expect this change in spectral index to accompany the change in the fir - radio parameter on a same timescales .",
    "it is generally accepted that galaxies like the milky way are not to be considered as closed - box systems ( unlike starburst galaxies ) , but should be expected to `` leak '' cosmic - rays on timescales of @xmath19 yr @xcite .",
    "so for a galaxy like the milky way , with supernova rate of @xmath20 yr @xcite , @xmath21 supernova events will occur before escape losses become important , allowing an estimate of the maximal gcr flux . in order for tidal shocks to result in a cosmic - ray flux greater than the already present gcr flux , their input needs to be equivalent to about @xmath22 supernova events .",
    "consequently , the volume of gas shocked by tidal shocks needs to be equal to volume shocked by that many supernova events , assuming the same acceleration efficiency . taking that particles are efficiently accelerated in supernova remnants up to the radius of @xmath23 pc @xcite",
    ", we find that tidal shocks would need to shock all the gas up to the radius of about 1 kpc in a galactic disk of thickness @xmath24pc .",
    "this would take about 10 million years , assuming a conservative radial tidal shocks with velocity @xmath25 ( tidal shocks are weaker than collision shocks which are of the order of the velocity of merging galaxies @xmath26few hundred km / s ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we estimate that this early stage where non - thermal emission due to tcrs can be neglected , would last during the first few million of years , or more precisely _ early & & 13 myr ( ) ^-1 ( ) ^3/2 ( ) ^-1/2 + & & ( ) ^1/2 ( )    in the case of starburst galaxies with @xmath27 higher supernova rates , this timescale would be about a factor of 3 higher .",
    "note however that supernova ( i.e. star - formation ) rate determined from radio observations would not be suitable within the framework of our hypothesis because if tidal cosmic - ray population is present it might lead to enhanced radio emission resulting in a overestimate of star - formation rates .",
    "a better way , free from possible `` contamination '' , would be to use star - formation rates determined from h@xmath5 observations to test how galactic interactions might impact our understanding of star - formations rates",
    ". this will be the topic of a follow - up study .      at few tens of million of years since the beginning of interaction ,",
    "acceleration of particles in tidal shocks will start to be significant . in an extreme scenario ,",
    "non - thermal emission of a population of tidal cosmic - rays will at some point become dominant over the galactic cosmic - ray population .",
    "this would be late enough in the interaction so that the star - formation has been triggered by tidal shocks , resulting in additional heating of the gas and dust due to new stars .",
    "the approximate start of this stage would be at the timescale of stellar contraction and formation , that is , this stage would begin at least tens of millions of years after the formation of tidal shocks .",
    "tidal shock heating then becomes less important as the source of thermal emission . on the other hand , tcrs",
    "are now a dominant source of non - thermal emission given that formation of new stars has not yet been accompanied with the increase in gcrs flux . in that case",
    "we expect a decrease in the fir - radio parameter below its typical value @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 .",
    "the decrease in the fir - radio parameter would be accompanied with a steeper ( softer ) radio spectral index @xmath30 , compared to a typical observed value in radio , reflecting a larger presence of a non - thermal component . again",
    ", this evolution in spectral index would be expected to be on the same timescale as the evolution of the fir - radio parameter .",
    "a quick look into energetics also leads to the conclusion that tidal cosmic - ray population may become dominant at some point .",
    "namely , one supernova event injects approximately @xmath31 erg / yr into the interstellar medium , where @xmath32 of that energy is generally considered to go into particle acceleration .",
    "we note that this energy - injection rate is valid for normal , star - forming galaxy like the milky way . in the case of starburst galaxies with much higher supernova rates ,",
    "energy - injection rate would clearly also be higher .",
    "this means that the following estimate is valid for the early epoch of galactic interaction , where supernovae from subsequently triggered starburst phase have not yet injected their energy . that will be the epoch where tidal cosmic - ray flux can be a potentially significant addition to the already present galactic cosmic - ray flux .",
    "following @xcite we estimate the kinetic energy of the encounter between milky way type galaxies at a distance of @xmath33 kpc is @xmath34 erg . for a minor merger where smaller component is 1000 times",
    "less massive energy of interaction is @xmath35 erg .",
    "this energy estimate is of the order of tidal energy that gets injected in the system ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath0 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of this energy goes into particle acceleration and if interaction timescale is of the order of @xmath36 yr , we find that the rate at which tidal shocks can inject energy into particles is @xmath37 erg / yr for major merger and @xmath38 erg / yr for minor merger .",
    "we see that in the case of major mergers , tidal shocks have the potential to dominate the non - thermal emission . in the case of minor mergers tcrs",
    "can be at the @xmath0 level of the gcrs , which is a smaller effect .",
    "note however that this was estimated assuming that the smaller component has large star - formation and supernova rates equal to the milky way . in reality , for a smaller system , we would expect this rate to be orders of magnitude lower for a galaxy 1000 times less massive than milky way . in that case energy injection rate of tidal shocks",
    "compared to supernovae would be much higher .",
    "on the other hand , in later phases , when star - formation is triggered by the merger , star - formation rate of such small systems can indeed be as high as for the milky way .",
    "another way to look into energetics is to compare the energy of tidal interaction with the non - thermal luminosity of the source .",
    "let us , for example , consider the case of stage 3 system ngc5256 , with component masses of @xmath39 and @xmath40 and separation of about 7.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "if we then assume that they tidally interact over the timescale of 1 gyr , we find that tidal energy injection rate is of the order of @xmath41 erg / s .",
    "if we compare this to source luminosity at 4.8 ghz @xmath42 erg / s @xcite we see that for electron - to - proton ratio of 1/100 at energy 1 gev , @xmath43 of tidal interaction energy needs to be converted into 1 gev cosmic - rays to account for luminosity at 4.8 ghz band .",
    "acceleration efficiency for even this conservative estimate is consistent with typical acceleration efficiencies in supernova remnants @xcite .    in order to check",
    "if tcrs accelerated in large - scale tidal shocks that traverse through entire interacting galaxies , can produce observed non - thermal radio emission and spectra , we analyze the case of ic1623 , which is one of the systems in our sample that is a stage 3 merger with lower than typical fir - radio parameter @xmath44 , and steeper than typical spectral index @xmath45 . following bell s theory of particle acceleration in shock fronts @xcite we calculate radio emissivity of shocked gas assuming that the entire gas of ic1623 was shocked by tidal shocks of speed 250 - 300 km / s , that number density of ism is 1 @xmath46 and that the average galactic magnetic field is of strength 10 - 25 @xmath47 g @xcite .",
    "based on that , and adopting its measured spectral index we calculate the expected luminosity at 1.4 ghz @xmath48 w / hz . this is in very good agreement with luminosity calculated from observed flux @xmath49 w / hz @xcite .",
    "tens to hundreds of million of years from the beginning of interaction , star - formation rates would be increasing , accompanied by the increase in supernova rate but with slight offset at order of lifetime of massive stars .",
    "this is consistent with results from numerical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which give that first enhancements in star - formation rates would be few hundred million years in the interaction after the first passage , followed by the star - burst epoch at time @xmath50 gyr from the beginning of interaction and lasting some 500 myrs . during that time",
    "the fir - radio parameter would start to grow as fir emission would be increasing due to new stars being born .",
    "finally , at the end of interaction one would expect a similar epoch of enhanced supernova rate .",
    "at that point , the fir - radio parameter would be expected to go back to its typical value comparable to that of isolated systems .",
    "finally , we note that at higher redshifts , timescales and durations of each phase would be different due to lower concentration of dust and lower metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".merger stage classification according to @xcite with corresponding symbols used on plots .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     as was discussed in section 2 , the evolution of the fir - radio parameter @xmath51 with respect to the merger stage would also be accompanied with the corresponding evolution in the radio spectral index .",
    "ongoing mid - stage mergers would be expected to have enhanced non - thermal emission with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this trend is actually seen on figure [ fig : alphavsq ] where we have plotted radio spectral index @xmath5 as a function of the fir - radio parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the upper left quadrant of the plot where @xmath51 is lower than typical @xmath54 ( dashed line ) and radio spectral index is higher than typical ( dashed line ) , is dominated by merger stage 3 and 4 systems . as opposed to that , the bottom right quadrant with @xmath51 higher than typical and radio spectral index lower than typical value , is dominated by the late merger stages 4 and 5 , as would be expected . in the case of merger stage 3",
    "the t - test gives a p - value of @xmath55 that this offset of stage 3 spectral index from typical value is random .",
    "( @xmath4 ) measured between 1.4 ghz and 4.8 ghz , as a function of the @xmath51 parameter for the same sample of interacting star - forming galaxies at different merger stages @xcite labeled using the same symbols as noted in table 1 .",
    "dashed lines represent typical values of radio spectral index @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath51 @xcite parameter for star - forming galaxies . for our data",
    "set we have calculate the scatter around the mean spectral index to be @xmath54 which is consistent with results from @xcite , while the scatter of the mean fir - radio parameter is @xmath57.,width=279 ]",
    "in this paper we explore and draw attention to important effects that close - galactic interaction and mergers can have on the stability of the widely - used fir - radio correlation .",
    "close galactic interactions produce tidal shocks in interacting galaxies which leads to gas and dust heating . moreover , particle acceleration in tidal shocks gives rise to a tidal cosmic - ray population .",
    "these two effects would impact the infrared and radio emission of the interacting galaxies and cause variations in the fir - radio parameter @xmath58 and radio spectral index over different merger stages . to test this ,",
    "we have analyzed the sample of 43 ir bright interacting galaxies in different merger stages , looking at how their fir - radio parameter and radio spectral index change over different merger stages .",
    "what we have tentatively found is that @xmath58 first decreases during early merger stages , and then later increases .",
    "this is consistent with what would be expected if the heating of the gas and dust in tidal shocks is the dominant effect at early merger stages , followed by the phase where tidal cosmic - ray emission dominates over the existing gcr emission , and eventually ending with the enhanced star - formation taking this correlation parameter back to its typical value . as a result ,",
    "if interacting galaxies are included in the fir - radio correlation , they could be one possible cause of its observed dispersion , and probably a dominant cause of its dispersion going to a higher redshifts where merger rates are higher .",
    "our results are consistent with results of @xcite who was the first to point out the possible impact of galactic interactions on the fir - radio relation .",
    "while @xcite was mostly focused on describing the radio emission of `` taffy''-like systems , here we wanted to also include the cases where there is amplified radio emission like in the galaxy ngc5256 and galaxies alike which can not be treated as `` taffy''-like due to lack of @xmath59 gas in the bridge between the two galaxies .",
    "more specifically , the ngc5256 consists of a pair of galaxies , comparable in size and scale @xcite with projected separation between their nuclei of about 8 kpc .",
    "it has a very low @xmath60 value , and recent multi - wavelength studies @xcite uncovered several interesting features in these luminous ir - galaxies : ( a ) the optical morphology of the ngc 5256 north - east nuclear environment is similar to the radiative shock observed south of the nucleus of m51 ; ( b ) bridge of co@xmath61 emission is spatially decoupled from the radio continuum emission ; ( c ) steeper radio index is observed not only in the region in between galaxies , but also close to the edges of both components ( see radio maps in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( d ) whereas the bulk of the @xmath62 molecules in taffy systems is located between the nuclei , the @xmath62 in ngc5256 is still bound to the galaxies ; ( e ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc 5256 can be modeled as a starburst - dominated , however compared to galaxies with the same sed description ( for example , ngc 2623 or ngc 6240 ) , but different merging stage , the ngc5256 shows evidence of higher dust temperatures ; ( f ) a soft x - ray emission extending 15 kpc to the north of the system , between the nuclei , was observed @xcite , revealing the presence of shock - heated gas indicating that corresponding synchrotron radio emission is shock - induced .",
    "this case shows that even in non-``taffy'' systems there can be important shocking of gas and dust and particle acceleration within the interacting galaxy .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have studied how tidal interactions affect the evolution of galactic magnetic fields and according to their analysis of polarization data in two taffy systems ( ugc12914/5 and ugc813/6 ) , they found a well - ordered magnetic field in the bridge in one of them ( ugc12914/5 ) , corresponding more to a shocked gas well before a adiabatic ( sedov ) phase , which was the scenario analyzed in @xcite to explain the bridge emission .",
    "all of this indicates that tidal shocks in interacting galaxies , their evolution and effects can provide a general solution to effects observed in interacting and merging systems .    if tidal shocks and cosmic - ray acceleration are the underlying reason for merging and interacting galaxies to deviate from the well - established fir - radio correlation , this effect can be used at high redshifts as a tool in searching for interacting systems and testing our understanding of high redshift interaction rates",
    "moreover , departure from the fir - radio correlation in the case of interacting systems could have important consequences for determination of star - formation rates @xcite leading to its overestimate .",
    "a more reliable way to determine star - formation rates in interacting galaxies would be to look into h@xmath5 emission that directly probes emission of massive young stars .",
    "for example , the mean star - formation rate determined from radio observations for our entire sample of 43 galaxies is @xmath63/yr , while h@xmath5 observations give the average of @xmath64/yr .",
    "the effects of this will be explored in the follow - up work .    in order to determine",
    "if indeed interacting systems deviate from the well - established fir - radio correlation and how , a larger sample of bright ir galaxies along with radio data has to be analyzed .",
    "the data available from surveys such are @xmath65 and @xmath66 along with the upcoming data from _ alma _ will provide a perfect testing ground for this .",
    "for example , @xmath66 survey is using deep near - ir imaging to reveal morphological classifications of distant ir - bright galaxies and directly counts the number of interacting pairs up to ( @xmath67 ) , while @xmath65 survey uses interferometric follow - up observations of distant dusty star - forming galaxies to redshifts even greater than @xmath68 . with _",
    "alma _ it would be possible to resolve these dusty galaxies into individual pairs for a large sample of radio faint submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) . combining different radio maps it would be possible to determine spectral indices of distant smgs , and trace the fir - radio correlation for a large sample of smgs free from the biases .",
    "besides the need for a larger sample , it would also be important to obtain multi - wavelength observations of systems that are found to be good candidates to be dominated by tidal cosmic ray population .",
    "an example of such systems would be the whirlpool galaxy , m51 ( or ngc 5194 ) and ngc 5256 .",
    "recent pdbi arcsecond whirlpool survey ( paws ) @xcite revealed the presence of additional cosmic ray emission in spiral arms of the ngc 5194 where low rate of ongoing star formation is present .",
    "the smaller companion , ngc 5195 , was found to have low or no ongoing star formation @xcite , however , it has uncharacteristically high dust temperature @xcite , possibly due to shock heating .",
    "since the effects of tidal shocks would be most pronounced in the smaller of the interacting components for which very little data is currently available , it would also be important to observe best candidates of those smaller galaxies especially in radio and ir domains .",
    "we are grateful to francois mernier and jovana petrovic for valuable discussions and comments .",
    "we are also thankful to the anonymous referee for very constructive comments and points which improved this paper .",
