    "the double - pulsar system psr j0737@xmath03039a / b @xcite provides a wonderful laboratory for investigations of relativistic gravity @xcite as well as the physics of pulsar magnetospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the system consists of a 22-ms pulsar , , in a 2.4-h binary orbit with , a younger pulsar with a spin period of 2.7 s. the system is mildly eccentric ( @xmath4 ) and is viewed nearly edge - on ( orbit inclination @xmath5 ) . with mean orbital speeds",
    "@xmath6 , the system is highly relativistic , allowing the detection of four `` post - keplerian '' parameters in just six months of observation @xcite .",
    "the post - keplerian parameters , together with the mass ratio , uniquely measurable in this double - pulsar system , give accurate values for the masses of the two stars as well as stringent tests of general relativity @xcite .",
    "within the framework of general relativity , the spin vectors of the two pulsars are expected to exhibit geodetic precession about the total angular momentum of the system @xcite .",
    "since the total angular momentum is dominated by the orbital motion , the pulsar spin vectors effectively precess about the orbit normal .",
    "the precession rate @xmath7 depends on the keplerian parameters and the masses of both pulsars , with predicted precessional periods of @xmath8 yr and @xmath9 yr for  and   respectively @xcite .",
    "these are about a factor of four shorter than the value for psr b1913 + 16 , the hulse - taylor binary pulsar ( weisberg , romani & taylor 1989 ) . in general",
    ", precession will result in a change of the width and shape of the observed profile as the angle of the line of sight with respect to the pulsar spin axis ( @xmath10 ) changes during the precessional period .",
    "long - term evolution of the mean pulse profile has been observed in psr b1913 + 16 @xcite and psr b1534 + 12 @xcite and interpreted as evidence for geodetic precession .",
    "this gives the three - dimensional geometry ( within a @xmath11 ambiguity ) of the system and , in the case of psr b1913 + 16 , a prediction that the pulsar will no longer be visible after the year 2025 .",
    "@xcite have used the precessional motion to produce a two - dimensional image of the part of the psr b1913 + 16 emission beam traversed so far , suggesting that the beam is elongated in the latitudinal direction .",
    "if the magnetic - pole model @xcite is assumed , @xmath10 and the inclination angle of the magnetic axis with respect to the spin axis ( @xmath12 ) can be deduced from a fit of the model to the observed variations of polarization position - angle , at least for wide profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used such an analysis to conclude that  is a nearly aligned system with @xmath13 , but the fit to the observed position angle variations is poor .",
    "the observer angle @xmath10 is unconstrained by this fit .",
    "@xcite determined possible geometries of the j0737@xmath03039a / b system based on a model for the orbital modulation of the  pulse intensity .",
    "two solutions were obtained with ( @xmath14 ) of ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) respectively .",
    "the first of these is consistent with the @xcite solution .",
    "both solutions predict a rapid evolution of the observed profile width of , with expected changes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 per year for the two models . here",
    "we report on observations of the mean pulse profile of  over a three - year interval , 2001 august to 2004 august .",
    "we have used the parkes 64-m radio telescope to observe the psr j0737@xmath03039a / b system since 2003 may 1 ( mjd 52670 ) , shortly after its confirmation , to 2004 august 8 ( mjd 53225 ) . observations were made in three frequency bands centered at 680 , 1390 and 3030 mhz , with the 680-mhz ( 50 cm ) and 3030-mhz ( 10 cm ) observations commencing in 2003 , december . before 2003 october , the 1390 mhz observations were made using the center beam of the multibeam receiver , which has an equivalent system noise of approximately 29 jy .",
    "in addition , we have the original survey pointing , a 4-min observation made at 1390 mhz on 2001 august 22 @xcite .",
    "after 2003 october , the h - oh receiver with a system noise of about 42 jy was used .",
    "both the multibeam and h - oh systems were dual polarization and used a filterbank system consisting of @xmath19 mhz channels .",
    "after detection , the two polarizations for each channel were summed , sampled at either 80 @xmath20s or 125 @xmath20s intervals and recorded to tape for subsequent processing .",
    "the other two bands were observed using the dual - polarization coaxial 10cm/50 cm receiver , with system noises of @xmath21 jy and @xmath22 jy at 10 cm and 50 cm respectively .",
    "a filterbank system with @xmath23 mhz channels was used with the 50 cm receiver and at 10 cm the filterbank system had @xmath24 mhz channels .    over the 15-month interval",
    ", we obtained 59 observations at 1390 mhz , 17 observations at 680 mhz and 27 at 3030 mhz , all with durations ranging from 10 min to 5 hr .",
    "data from each observation were folded at the apparent topocentric period of  to form mean pulse profiles with 256 phase bins , which were then summed in frequency and time to form a single profile using the psrchive data analysis system ( hotan , van straten & manchester 2004 ) .",
    "all observations for each frequency band were then summed to form grand - average profiles containing 116 , 27 and 34 hrs of data , respectively .",
    "these profiles are shown in figure  [ fg:3frq ]",
    ".     of longitude corresponds to the pulse period .",
    "the 680-mhz and 3030-mhz profiles were aligned to give maximum cross - correlation with the 1390-mhz profile . ]    the 1390-mhz observations over the 15 months from 2003 may were divided into eight chronologically - ordered groups and average profiles were formed for each of these eight groups .",
    "integration times ranged between 5 hrs ( mjd 53068 ) and 20 hrs ( mjd 53000 ) .",
    "examination of these average profiles showed little or no evidence for evolution of the mean pulse profile over the 15-month interval .",
    "the eight profiles were each aligned with the grand - average profile using a cross - correlation analysis and baselines subtracted , taking the longitude range @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( figure  [ fg:3frq ] ) as the baseline region . each profile was scaled to have the same area as the grand - average profile , which was then subtracted from it to form the difference profiles shown in figure  [ fg : diff ] .",
    "also shown at the bottom of the figure is the difference profile corresponding to a stretched version of the grand - average profile , demonstrating the signature of a change in profile width . the adopted stretch factor ( 1.004 )",
    "corresponds to an increase of about @xmath27 in profile width , where the width is defined to be the separation of the steep outer edges of the profile ( at roughly @xmath28  and @xmath29  in figures  [ fg:3frq ] and [ fg : diff ] ) at 10% of the amplitude of the second ( stronger ) component .",
    "significant differences are seen , especially between mjds of 53000 and 53103 . in general , these differences do not have the signature of an increase or decrease in profile width , but rather appear to result from changes in the relative amplitude of the various pulse components , especially at the leading and trailing components of the profile .",
    "polarization observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that these components have high linear polarization .",
    "it is likely that the observed changes are an instrumental effect resulting from differences in receiver gain between the two polarization channels combined with parallactic angle variations .",
    "these difference profiles confirm the lack of significant secular profile evolution .",
    "there is no evidence for a systematic change in the overall profile width to a level of much less than @xmath27 and there is no evidence for any intrinsic changes in the width or shape of the leading and trailing pulse components considered separately .",
    "we have also reprocessed the original 4-min survey pointing to give a profile with signal - to - noise ratio of about 25 . again",
    ", this shows no evidence for any significant change in profile shape or width .        in order to quantify the profile stability ,",
    "widths at 10% of the pulse peak were measured for each of the eight 1390-mhz profiles and the 2001 observation using a cross - correlation technique .",
    "the leading ( @xmath26  @xmath30 in figures  [ fg:3frq ] and [ fg : diff ] ) and trailing ( @xmath31  @xmath25 ) pulse components were separately cross - correlated with a standard profile derived from the grand - average profile containing just the relevant component , determining the phase of each component relative to a reference phase .",
    "the difference of these phases was then added to the 10% width of the grand - average profile to give the 10% width at each epoch .",
    "errors from the cross - correlation analysis were increased in quadrature by 10 @xmath20s to allow for systematic effects .",
    "the derived 10% widths are plotted in figure  [ fg : width ] along with the fitted trend line .",
    "clearly , there is no significant trend , with the fitted slope being @xmath32 per year .",
    "the 10% profile width at mjd 53000 ( 2003 december 27 ) from the fit is @xmath33 .",
    "quoted errors are @xmath34 for both the width and slope .    .",
    "the dashed line is a formal weighted least - squares fit of a linear trend to these data . ]",
    "figure  [ fg:3frq ] confirms the overall bilateral symmetry of the  pulse profile , consistent with its origin from magnetic field lines associated with a single magnetic pole @xcite .",
    "there are significant differences in the spectral indices of the various pulse components .",
    "the most striking of these is the relatively flat spectrum of the component at the extreme leading edge of the profile which is relatively much stronger at 3030 mhz .",
    "the 3030-mhz profile also shows a matching flat - spectrum component at the extreme trailing edge of the profile , reinforcing the idea that both components of the observed profile originate on field lines associated with a single magnetic pole .",
    "we assume this in the following discussion .",
    "the main result of this paper is the extraordinary stability of the  pulse profile over more than three years , a significant fraction of the expected geodetic precessional period of 75 years .",
    "provided the angle between the spin axis of the pulsar and the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath2 ) is non - zero , we would expect to see a variation in profile width as a function of time .",
    "in particular , the system geometries proposed by @xcite predict changes of many tens of degrees per year in the observed profile width . clearly , these are not observed , ruling out this model in its present form .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed lack of variation in profile width is that the spin axis of  is aligned with the orbital angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "since we view the orbit nearly edge - on , even for an orthogonal magnetic axis ( @xmath36 ) , this would require an effective beam radius @xmath37 , which seems unlikely .",
    "furthermore , given that  probably suffered a significant natal kick , an aligned rotation axis for   is possible but unlikely ( willems , kalogera & henninger 2004 ) .",
    "we have investigated the limits which can be placed on the geometry of the system by modeling the observed profile width as a function of time ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "an inclination angle @xmath38 is assumed is determined at present , equivalent solutions are possible with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , etc . ] . for a circular emission beam ,",
    "four parameters are sufficient to model the expected profile changes : @xmath12 , @xmath2 , @xmath41 and an epoch @xmath42 describing the precession phase .",
    "we fitted a circular beam model with @xmath43 to the data and derive a @xmath44-sphere plot for @xmath12 and @xmath2 as shown in figure  [ fg : prec ] .",
    "this figure shows that solutions with misalignment angle @xmath45 are preferred , consistent with the conclusions of @xcite based on the observed velocity of the system .",
    "the formal best - fit solution ( reduced @xmath46 ) is located at @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( and at a corresponding mirror - solution of @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the predicted time variation for the observed profile width for this configuration is shown in figure  [ fg : prec](a ) ; pulses would be detected over the whole precessional period with an approximately sinusodial variation in the profile width .",
    "however , the @xmath44-sphere is rather flat , and a statistically satisfactory solution is possible over a wide range of angles . figure  [ fg : prec](b ) shows a solution with small @xmath12 and @xmath2 which is consistent with the preferred solution of @xcite based on the observed position angle variations .",
    "both of these solutions have a beam radius of very close to @xmath51 corresponding to a fan beam . in case ( b ) however , the pulse is visible for a limited period only , roughly 1984 to 2023 .",
    "figure  [ fg : prec](c ) shows a solution with intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath2 for which the beam radius is smaller , about @xmath52 . in all solutions ,",
    "the observed pulse is emitted from field lines associated with a single magnetic pole as indicated by the observed profile symmetry .     to the orbit",
    "normal , with a circular beam of radius @xmath41 inclined at an angle @xmath12 to the pulsar spin axis .",
    "the upper part shows contours of @xmath44 at 1-@xmath53 intervals , relative to the minimum value , with the darker regions having lower @xmath44 .",
    "the lower cutoff to the allowed regions represents the locus of points where the beam radius @xmath54 .",
    "these contours are mirrored for @xmath55 with ( @xmath12 , @xmath2 ) corresponding to ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) . in the lower part of the figure ,",
    "the variation of profile width is shown as a function of time for three cases :",
    "( a ) a point near the global minimum for @xmath44 , ( b ) a small @xmath12 , small @xmath2 case , and ( c ) a solution with intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath2 . the angle @xmath10 is the minimum value of the inclination of the line of sight to the pulsar spin axis which occurs at precessional phase zero ( or @xmath11 ) when the pulsar spin axis is in the plane defined by the orbit normal and the line of sight . ]",
    "unless @xmath58 , the essentially constant profile width observed so far implies that the system is at or close to precessional phase zero ( or @xmath11 ) .",
    "at these times is @xmath59 . , where @xmath60 is the precessional phase , which results in @xmath61 , but this requires an improbable fine - tuning of the system parameters .",
    "] this is possible  a similar situation evidently applies for psr b1913 + 16 @xcite  but statistically unlikely .",
    "a possible way of relaxing this constraint is to allow a non - circular beam . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that , under certain assumptions , the polar emission beam is compressed in the latitudinal direction for @xmath62 . on the other hand , polarization observations of young and millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest beams effectively elongated in the latitude direction .",
    "first , we took the model of @xcite in which the beam compression is a function of @xmath12 only and recomputed the @xmath44-sphere .",
    "the results were only marginally different to those shown in figure  [ fg : prec ] .",
    "we then took the beam ellipticity as a free parameter , first doing a grid search in ellipticity at each point on the ( @xmath12,@xmath2 ) plane and then searching for a global @xmath44 minimum in ( @xmath63 , @xmath42 , @xmath64 ) space , where @xmath63 is the beam major axis , @xmath42 is the time of precessional phase zero and @xmath64 is the beam ellipticity .",
    "latitudinally compressed beams with axial ratio @xmath65 are restricted to a fairly small range of @xmath12 and @xmath2 around @xmath66 . on the other hand , fan - like beams with",
    "large axial ratio allow a much larger range of @xmath12 and @xmath2 with values @xmath67 preferred .",
    "however , in none of these cases was the @xmath44 value significantly better than those found in the circular - beam case .    in conclusion , we find that the pulse - width variations ( or lack of them ) observed so far allow a wide range of configurations for the psr j0737@xmath03039a / b system .",
    "models with non - circular beams give somewhat better fits to the data but are statistically indistinguishable from fits with a circular beam .",
    "misalignment angles @xmath68 are generally preferred , consistent with the conclusions of @xcite , and the configurations discussed by @xcite can be ruled out .",
    "solutions in which the pulse never disappears from view are possible , as are solutions where it does , in the most extreme cases about 15 years from now .",
    "clearly , a longer time baseline , even one more year , will help to constrain the models , as will a more realistic interpretation of the observed position - angle variations .",
