    "faraday rotation is a physical phenomenon where the position angle of linearly polarized radiation propagating through a magneto - ionic medium is rotated as a function of frequency .",
    "faraday rotation measure ( rm ) synthesis is an important method for analyzing multichannel polarized radio data , where multiple emitting regions are present along the single line of sight of the observations @xcite . in practice",
    ", the method requires the recovery of the faraday dispersion function ( fdf ) from measurements restricted to limited wavelength ranges , which is an ill - conditioned deconvolution problem , raising important computational difficulties .",
    "at least four different approaches have been proposed so far to solve this problem .",
    "a first approach uses an adaptation of the clean algorithm @xcite to the rm deconvolution ( rm - clean ) @xcite .",
    "the second approach is wavelet - based , and assumes field symmetries in order to project the observed data onto @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the third approach relies on nonlinear model fitting @xcite , while the fourth approach is based on the novel compressed sensing ( cs ) paradigm @xcite . whether these methods are successful or not in detecting the structure of the fdf depends on the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) , the separation of the rm components , the relative angle of the rm components at the observed wavelengths , and the wavelength range .",
    "for example , the current existing methods fail to recover the correct rm components when the separation among them is below the resolution determined from the half maximum of the main peak of the rm spread function ( rmsf ) .",
    "also , another major problem is related to situations where the interference of pairs of rm components conspire to place the peak response of the fdf outside of the rm range between the two input rm components . in this case",
    ", the standard rm - clean method fails , due to its intrinsic greedy mechanism used to pick up the rm components . here",
    "we discuss a novel approach , which addresses these two significant problems from a different perspective .",
    "the proposed method is an extension of the multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm , which is based on the eigen - decomposition ( ed ) of the covariance matrix of the observed data @xcite .",
    "the complexity and the speed of the method is therefore determined by the size of the eigen - decomposition problem , which for several hundreds of data points is comparable to the rm - clean approach .",
    "our numerical results show that for high to moderate s / n cases , the rm - music method gives very good results , outperforming the standard approach based on rm - clean . for low s / n situations ,",
    "both the rm - music and rm - clean methods provide similar results .",
    "we should note that contrary to the other existing methods , the rm - music method recovers only the faraday depth values .",
    "once the faraday depth values are determined , the real and imaginary parts of the rm components can be easily computed using the linear least squares fitting approach .",
    "the faraday depth ( in @xmath1 ) is defined as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron density ( in @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the magnetic field ( in @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 is the infinitesimal path length ( in parsecs ) .",
    "we also define the complex polarization as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fractional polarization , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the observed stokes parameters , and @xmath13 is the polarization angle observed at wavelength @xmath14 .",
    "also , we assume that the observed polarization @xmath15 originates from the emission at all possible values of @xmath16 , corresponding to the fourier transform :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the complex fdf ( the intrinsic polarized flux , as a function of the faraday depth ) .",
    "thus , in principle @xmath18 is the inverse fourier transform of the observed quantity @xmath15 : @xmath19 however , this operation is ill - defined since we can not observe @xmath15 for @xmath0 , and also in general the observations are limited to an interval @xmath20 $ ] .    in order to deal with the above limitations ,",
    "the observed polarization is defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the observation window function , with @xmath23 for @xmath24 $ ] , and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "therefore , for @xmath26 measurement channels with frequencies @xmath27 , wavelengths @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the speed of light ) , weights @xmath31 , polarizations @xmath32 , we obtain the following discrete expression for the fdf : @xmath33 where @xmath34^{-1}\\ ] ] is a normalization constant , and the reference wavelength @xmath35 is defined as : @xmath36    in our approach we assume that the model of @xmath18 contains @xmath37 ( unknown ) components @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are complex and @xmath40 are real quantities @xmath41 : @xmath42 considering additive noise in the measurement process , the sampled polarization - domain channel response is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath26 is the number of measured channels . here , both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are gaussian variables with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , @xmath18 is a `` dirty '' reconstruction , and a deconvolution step is necessary to recover the rm components @xmath38 , given the observed values @xmath47 and the weights @xmath48 .",
    "the music method is generally used for estimating frequencies in signal processing problems , and the location of pointlike scatterers in imaging problems ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the standard music method is based on the ed of an hermitian operator , which corresponds to the covariance matrix of the signal or the array response matrix . by the finite - dimensional spectral theorem ,",
    "such operators can be associated with an orthonormal basis of the underlying space in which the operator is represented as a diagonal matrix with real number entries .",
    "the main idea is to estimate the frequencies , or to localize multiple sources , by exploiting the eigen - structure of this hermitian operator .",
    "more exactly the space spanned by its eigenvectors can be partitioned into two orthogonal subspaces , namely the signal subspace and the noise subspace . by exploiting the orthogonality of the signal and noise subspaces , the music method significantly improves the resolution ( i.e. locating closely spaced frequencies or scatterers ) , and as a consequence it is considered a super - resolution method .",
    "let us now formulate the standard music approach to the faraday depth recovery problem .",
    "since only one snapshot of measurement data @xmath49 of length @xmath26 is available , the data sequence is divided into @xmath50 segments of length @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and then the @xmath53 covariance matrix is estimated as : @xmath54 where @xmath55^{t}$ ] , @xmath56 , and the superscript @xmath57 denotes the conjugate transpose operation .",
    "suppose that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the eivenvalues , and respectively the eigenvectors of @xmath60 , such that : @xmath61 and @xmath62 since the measured signal contains only @xmath63 components , the last @xmath64 eigenvalues of @xmath60 , @xmath65 , should be small and below the noise level , and we say that the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath66 span the noise subspace of @xmath60 , while the first @xmath63 eigenvectors @xmath67 span the signal subspace , and the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvalues @xmath68 should be above the noise level . thus , the eigen - decomposition of @xmath60 can be written as : @xmath69 we can now form the projection operator onto the noise subspace defined as : @xmath70 and consider the signal subspace sampling vector @xmath71^{t},\\ ] ] where the wavelengths are interpolated as following : @xmath72^{2},\\quad\\ell=0,1, ... ,l-1,\\ ] ] such that they cover the initial observation interval @xmath73 $ ] we should note that since @xmath74 , the faraday depth is also linearly interpolated as @xmath75 , and therefore we obtain : @xmath76^{t}.\\ ] ] if the vector @xmath77 represents the signal , i.e. it is a linear combination of the signal subspace eigenvectors , then its projection onto the noise subspace must be close to zero : @xmath78 thus , the faraday depth values @xmath40",
    ", @xmath79 , should correspond to the maxima of the following music pseudo - spectrum : @xmath80    once the faraday depth values @xmath40 are determined from the music pseudo - spectrum the real and imaginary parts of the rm components @xmath39 can be easily computed using the linear least squares fitting approach , i.e. by solving the following minimization problem : @xmath81^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath82 this least - squares fit problem has fewer free parameters , and it is far better constrained than the fit that would have been done without music .",
    "in fact the problem has an unique minimum norm solution , obtained by solving the linear system of equations : @xmath83 , where @xmath84^{t}$ ] are the unknown components , @xmath85^{t}$ ] are the observed polarizations , and @xmath86 is the fourier matrix with the elements @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the least squares solution is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse of @xmath86 .",
    "in order to optimally use the music method we also need to determine the number of components @xmath63 in the polarization signal . in principle , @xmath63 can be determined from the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix .",
    "the first largest eigenvalues , which are much bigger than the noise level @xmath90 , @xmath91 , should indicate the value of @xmath63 .",
    "however , in a practical implementation , when the covariance matrix is estimated from a small number of observations , it is challenging to clearly separate the signal eigenvalues from the noise eigenvalues . in these ambiguous cases one can use information theoretic criteria for selection , like the minimum descriptive length ( mdl ) criteria , where the value of @xmath63 corresponds to the minimum of the following quantity : @xmath92 @xmath93 also , since the smallest eigenvalues are not equal among them , one can use the following normalized versions of the music pseudo - spectrum : @xmath94 that accounts for the variation of the eigenvalues , and it is less sensitive to the @xmath63 estimation errors .",
    "another influencing parameter is the length of the data segments @xmath51 . in order to preserve as much information as possible in each data segment",
    "we should have @xmath95 .",
    "our numerical experiments have shown that @xmath96 has a good detection sensitivity , and this is the value used in the simulations presented here .",
    "we should note also that the speed of the rm - music depends on the parameter @xmath51 , which gives the size @xmath53 of the eigen - decomposition problem . for @xmath51 in the order of hundreds ,",
    "the speed of rm - music is comparable to the speed of rm - clean , or even faster .",
    "the pseudo - code of the rm - music method is given in algorithm 1 .",

    "the rm - music method works very well when the components are separated above the resolution limit @xmath129 .",
    "for example , in figure 1 we have two components with the complex amplitudes @xmath130 and @xmath117 at @xmath131 , and faraday depths @xmath118 , @xmath119 , separated by @xmath132 . for comparison we also give the `` dirty '' fdf and the rm - clean components .",
    "in order to make the results comparable , we scaled @xmath133 as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the maximum amplitudes of the original spectra .",
    "this way , both @xmath133 and @xmath137 are in the same range .",
    "one can see that the rm - music spectrum recovers almost exactly the faraday depths of the two components @xmath138 , @xmath139 , while both the `` dirty '' fdf and rm - clean fail to recover the faraday depth of the second component : @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , once the depths are recovered , the real and imaginary parts of the rm components can be easily computed using a linear least squares fitting approach , resulting in an almost exact recovery : @xmath142 , @xmath143 .    in figure 2",
    "we show that the music super - resolution method can give good results even for separations below the the resolution in faraday depth space @xmath129 . here , we have the same two components with faraday depths @xmath118 , @xmath125 , separated by @xmath144 .",
    "one can see that both components are correctly separated by the rm - music spectrum @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 . and",
    "once again the `` dirty '' fdf and rm - clean fail to recover the faraday depths , showing two main components at : @xmath149 , and respectively @xmath150 .",
    "this is a typical example where the interference of pairs of rm components conspire to place the peak response of the fdf outside of the rm range between the two input rm components . in figure 3",
    "we consider the same two components separated by @xmath151 , @xmath118 , @xmath127 . in this case",
    "the rm - music spectrum can not separate the components anymore , however it correctly shows only one maximum , situated between the two input rm components , while rm - clean suggests a single rm component outside the range of the input rms .    from the above examples we see that rm - music performs better than rm - clean for high to moderate s / n cases .",
    "however , in low s / n situations the performance of rm - music deteriorates .",
    "it is quite difficult to quantify the s / n ratio exactly and to find a limiting s / n value , and more future evaluations of the method are required for various wavelength ranges and noise levels per channel . for the considered experiment layout our numerical simulations have shown that if the amplitude of the strongest rm component is becoming smaller than @xmath152 , and for a noise per channel @xmath116 , rm - music begins to behave more like rm - clean , and can not separate correctly the input components . in figure 4",
    "we give such an example of two components with the complex amplitudes @xmath153 and @xmath154 , faraday depths @xmath118 and @xmath125 , separated by @xmath155 .",
    "one can see that in this case , both rm - music and rm - clean give similar results . we should also mention that the experiment layout used in simulations is very similar to the askap s possum survey @xcite , where the expected final noise is @xmath156 @xmath157jy / beam .",
    "this value suggests that for @xmath112 channels and a peak signal to noise threshold of @xmath158 , rm - music should work as indicated for sources with polarized flux higher than @xmath159 mjy / beam , which is rather bright but quite reasonable , since about @xmath160 of the nvss rm catalog sources fall into this category .",
