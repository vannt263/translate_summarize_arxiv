    "theories of spin - charge separation in the high-@xmath1 cuprates have been hotly debated almost since the original discovery of these materials @xcite . finding",
    "a theory of electrons in more than one spatial dimension which exhibits zero - temperature spin - charge separation has proved to be as theoretically challenging as it is phenomenologically appealing @xcite .",
    "it can be argued that all such theories will admit , in the low - energy limit , a formulation in terms of a @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "recent papers have addressed the problem of finding microscopic models of electrons which become fractionalized in some range of their parameters .",
    "it remains an important task to enumerate concrete , experimentally- measurable consequences of these exciting theoretical ideas .",
    "previously , we have explored the consequences of two - dimensional fractionalization on the spectral function , as probed by angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the inelastic neutron scattering signal from spinons in a fractionalized antiferromagnet ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we find that these spin-1/2 , charge - less excitations lead to a continuum of excitations above a gap .",
    "because we are interested in the parent insulators of cuprate superconductors , we have taken a phenomenological model for the spinons which gives them both a nel gap arising from antiferromagnetic ordering and a _ d_-wave pairing gap which becomes the pseudogap at moderate doping and the superconducting gap in the superconducting phase .",
    "we contrast this signal with the signal from excitations in a conventional antiferromagnet and calculate the strength of the spinon signal compared to the magnon signal ( which is also present ) . this comparison estimates the feasibility of measuring this anomalous signal in the parent insulators .",
    "we also discuss higher - order effects stemming from interactions between spinons and magnons .",
    "the @xmath0 phase has been discussed elsewhere @xcite and here we use the same phenomenological model introduced and justified @xcite previously .",
    "we assume that the steps of : ( 1 ) deriving a lattice hamiltonian containing all important effective interactions between electrons and ( 2 ) splitting the electron into chargon and spinon fields ( @xmath3 ) and deriving the appropriate @xmath2 gauge theory have been performed and we have arrived at the following effective low - energy hamiltonian for the system in 2-dimensional fractionalized phases : @xmath4   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + u \\sum_i [ \\hat{b}^{\\dag}_i\\hat{b}_i - ( 1-x)]^2 + h_g , \\label{separated } \\\\",
    "h_g & = & g\\sum_{<i , j > } \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_i \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_j ,   \\label{hg } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spinon pairing @xmath5 is taken to be _ d_-wave : @xmath6 and the spin operator is @xmath7 . here ,",
    "@xmath8 are nearest neighbors on a 2d square lattice .",
    "the @xmath9 term is a hubbard - like interaction for @xmath10 chargons per unit cell .",
    "we now briefly justify this model for the underdoped cuprate materials on phenomenological grounds . for sufficiently small doping and low temperatures such that the @xmath2 theory exhibits fractionalization ,",
    "the hamiltonian is as written in eq.([separated ] ) . at temperatures below the energy scale @xmath11 ,",
    "the spinons are effectively paired into _",
    "d_-wave singlets and there is a _",
    "d_-wave gap to spin-1/2 excitations . for large enough @xmath12 ( and an additional minuscule 3d spin coupling )",
    "the system develops long - range antiferromagnetic order . at half - filling",
    ", the chargons are gapped into an insulating phase and we obtain a fractionalized insulator with long - range nel order and an additional _ d_-wave gap to spin-1/2 excitations , previously dubbed @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "moving away from half - filling , the antiferromagnetic order will be quickly suppressed , while for @xmath13 and with an additional long - range coulomb interaction , one still expects the chargons to be insulating .",
    "we then have a fractionalized insulating phase with a _",
    "d_-wave gap to spin-1/2 excitations . within a spin - charge separation scenario ,",
    "this phase is identified with the pseudogap regime in the cuprates . for chargon",
    "hopping , @xmath14 , sufficiently large , the chargons bose condense , giving a _ d_-wave superconductor . at large dopings",
    ", we expect the system to recover fermi liquid properties , as occurs when the vortex excitations ( visons ) in the ising gauge field condense thereby confining the spinons and chargons to form the electron . a schematic phase diagram is shown in fig . [ phasediagram ] .",
    "in this paper , we elucidate further some of the properties of the @xmath0 phase , found at half - filling .",
    "recent experiments by bonn , moler,_et al _ put limits on the likelihood of this sort of spin - charge separation in @xmath15 , although the experiments have only been performed on one sample so far @xcite .",
    "the question of spin response in an antiferromagnet which is fractionalized is nevertheless well - posed and could be relevant to other materials .",
    "also , it is quite possible that some other sort of exotic order lurks in the cuprates ; this work would then serve as an illustrative calculation .",
    "= 3.5 in    [ phasediagram ]",
    "in this paper we work at half - filling , where the charge degrees of freedom will be gapped into a mott insulating phase , and calculate the spin response of the system , appropriate for magnetic probes such as neutron scattering .",
    "hence , from here on , we assume that the relevant piece of the hamiltonian in eq.([separated ] ) is that containing the spin degrees of freedom and we ignore the charge degrees of freedom . at temperatures",
    "much less than the vison energy , the chargons and spinons are essentially non - interacting , so this is reasonable in a fractionalized phase .",
    "@xmath16 ( eq.([hg ] ) ) may be decoupled in a path integral , using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",

[ sublattices ] .",

    "= 2.5 in    [ sublattices ]    we begin by analyzing eq.([wholeshebang ] ) at the mean field level .",
    "we find antiferromagnetic nel ordering and a quadratic theory for the spinons which can be solved exactly .",
    "we derive a self - consistency equation for the mean field approximation which connects the magnitude of the nel order to properties of the spinons .",
    "fluctuations about this mean field solution lead to spin - waves ( as in the conventional antiferromagnet ) .",
    "thus , we find that the fractionalized antiferromagnetic phase has two spin - carrying excitations : the spin-1 magnons and the spin-1/2 spinons , which interact with each other .",
    "to deal with these interactions , we treat the spinons as a perturbation : setting @xmath22 , one recovers the conventional antiferromagnet and its spin - wave excitations .",
    "integrating out the spinons to each order in @xmath23 and @xmath24 would give modifications of the spin - wave theory due to the spinons .",
    "if one wishes to find higher - order properties of the spinons , one may start with the mean field result and then integrate out the magnons , generating interactions between the spinons . in the limit @xmath25 ,",
    "it is clear that the theory in eq.([wholeshebang ] ) can be solved in a controlled fashion .",
    "first , we ignore the spinons , setting @xmath26 and reducing @xmath27 to the usual spin-1/2 quantum operator .",
    "eq.([wholeshebang ] ) becomes : @xmath28 choosing @xmath29 as the spin quantization axis , this is minimized classically by : latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are defined in eqns .",
    "( [ fdispersioni]-[fdispersionf ] ) .",
    "these formulas have a few salient features .",
    "spin - flip neutron scattering leaves a spin-1 excitation in the sample with momentum @xmath100 and energy @xmath66 .",
    "the expression for @xmath101 simply sums the ways of destroying a spin - down ( -up ) spinon at momentum @xmath102 and creating a spin - up ( -down ) spinon at momentum @xmath103 , with the constraint that the energy cost for this process must be @xmath66 .",
    "the rest of the expression is the zero - temperature probability that the state at @xmath102 is occupied and the one at @xmath103 is unoccupied , appropriate for fermions .",
    "if one takes @xmath104 ( corresponding to no nel order ) , the full spin - rotation invariance of the spinon system is restored and @xmath105 , as expected .    for ins using unpolarized neutrons",
    ", the differential cross section is a combination of these two signals , but it is possible using polarized neutrons to obtain signals from these two channels separately ( albeit at a large cost to the intensity ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , provided one aligns the polarized neutron spins along the direction of the staggered magnetization , the signal due to single magnons is only in the `` spin - flip '' sector , i.e. @xmath106 . the first contribution to @xmath107 from spin - waves alone occurs in the two - magnon channel which is of a greatly reduced weight compared to the single magnon signal . the spinons then constitute the only magnetic signal of reasonable weight in this channel at energy scales of order j.    a discussion of parameters is wise at this point . working in units of @xmath96 , we will use @xmath108 to calculate @xmath109 for the spinons .",
    "this gives numerical values of these constants which are reasonable for the undoped cuprates .",
    "however , one may wonder whether they violate our above working assumptions @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , it is not immediately obvious how to set the parameter @xmath12 . here , we take the following tack : the quantity @xmath111 is set by comparison between the magnon dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ mdispersionf ] ) and the maximum of the magnon dispersion in ins experiments .",
    "this gives @xmath112 .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath11 may similarly be set by experiments and we use the values given above . with these two constraints , the self - consistency equation , eq .",
    "( [ selfcon ] ) , becomes an equation for the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that if the values of @xmath50 and @xmath11 are too large , the equation for @xmath12 will have no solutions . for the parameters above , using the expansion ( valid for small @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) in eq.([expansion ] ) as a first iteration yields @xmath113 . plugging the resultant values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 into the full self - consistent equation for @xmath43 , the right hand side of eq.([selfcon ] ) can be numerically integrated for various values of @xmath43 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ selfconn0 ] .",
    "it is clear from the graph that the value of @xmath43 which satisfies the self - consistent equation is @xmath114 .",
    "this gives @xmath115 , and we have our self - consistent parameters .",
    "we note that the value @xmath116 is still rather close to the `` no spinon '' mean field value of unity , so that treating the spinons as a perturbation is somewhat justified @xcite .",
    "= 2.8 in    [ selfconn0 ]    the above expression for @xmath101 can be numerically integrated to obtain the spinon response .",
    "this has been performed , approximating the @xmath117-function in energy with a lorentzian of width @xmath118 .",
    "none of the salient features of the results were influenced by the specific values of parameters ( such as @xmath119 ) .      in figs .",
    "[ this ] and [ that ] we present the lowest - order results for @xmath120 , corresponding to spin - flip neutron scattering .",
    "all energies are in units of @xmath121 .",
    "note that we have taken the staggered magnetization to point in the @xmath29-direction , but since our theory does not contain terms which couple the spin and spatial variables ( as , say , a spin - orbit coupling would ) , the spin axes can be rotated independently of the spatial axes .",
    "= 2.5 in    [ cuts ]    as @xmath122 is a function of three variables ( for the effectively two - dimensional cuprates of interest ) , we show here a few views of this function . fig.[this ] , shows contour plots of the intensity as a function of distance along cuts in the @xmath123 plane ( shown in fig.[cuts ] ) and energy .",
    "for the magnon signal , the @xmath117-function in eq.([magnonweight ] ) has been replaced with a `` box '' function : @xmath124 with @xmath125 . in these plots , we see the magnon dispersion with zeros at @xmath126 and @xmath127 and a vanishing weight near @xmath128 . above this , we see the spinon continuum turn on with a lower - bound which is modulated with twice the period of the magnon dispersion .",
    "we see in this plot that the spinon signal is appreciable .",

    "we see that the spinon intensity at turn - on ( @xmath131 ) is largest near the corners at @xmath132 , etc . for comparison , fig .",

    "[ zz ] we present contour plots of @xmath133 sequentially along the cuts in fig .",
    "we note again that , to first order , there is no magnon contribution to this correlation function and so the two - spinon continuum visible in these plots should in principle be the primary magnetic source of ins in this channel .",
    "= 3.5 in    [ zz ]      at higher orders in the perturbation theory of eqns .",
    "( [ spqm1 ] -[spqm2 ] ) , we would expect spin wave interactions ( present and important for detailed features even when @xmath50 and @xmath11 are zero ) to modify the magnon dispersion and lead to multi - magnon signals in both the @xmath134 and @xmath107 channels .",
    "this calculation would be the same as for a conventional antiferromagnet ( since @xmath38 ) and would presumably lead to the actual spin - wave response in a conventional antiferromagnetic system . at higher orders in @xmath23 and @xmath135 , we would obtain magnon interactions mediated by spinons , which are not present in conventional antiferromagnets .",
    "being gapped excitations , the spinons are inherently a `` high energy '' phenomena as far as the spin - waves are concerned .",
    "we might therefore expect them to influence most heavily the high - energy portions of the magnon dispersion .",
    "one can see from the graphs given in section [ graphs ] that the lower edge of the spinon continuum has a minimum near @xmath136 , where the magnon dispersion has one of its maxima .",
    "one would expect interactions between these two excitations to effect the dispersions most heavily near these points of closest approach .",
    "while the effect of unconventional excitations such as spinons can in principle be seen in the spin - wave response , we have chosen in this paper to focus on the direct spinon contribution to inelastic neutron scattering , shown in the previous section .",
    "the spin - waves will also affect the spinon signal at higher orders , however , probably not in any dramatic fashion .",
    "in this paper we have presented a theory of the spin excitations of the fractionalized antiferromagnet , @xmath0 , in the limit where the visons can be ignored .",
    "this theory is eq.([wholeshebang ] ) .",
    "this phase has both long - ranged antiferromagnetic order and the topological order associated with fractionalization @xcite .",
    "it contains two spin - carrying excitations : the spin-1 magnons and the spin-1/2 spinons , which interact with each other .",
    "the theory is well - defined and can be solved in a controlled manner in the limit @xmath110 . in this paper , we have found the lowest - order theories of these two excitations and have calculated the dynamic spin - spin response functions of each , appropriate for inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "to lowest order , the magnon signal is the same as in a conventional antiferromagnet , but higher - order effects of the spinons should lead to modifications of the dispersion , particularly near @xmath136 .",
    "the main anomalous feature of the ins signal from @xmath0 is the presence of a spinon continuum at energies @xmath137 , which exists even in the longitudinal response , where the magnons are expected to be absent at lowest - order .",
