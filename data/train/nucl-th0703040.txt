    "these last years , much attention has been focussed on the modification of hadron properties in nuclear environment and more particularly in the sector of the light vector mesons .",
    "the hope is that this modification could shed some light on prominent features of qcd at low energy . in particular ,",
    "the knowledge of the dependence of the in - medium vector meson mass on the quark condensate is essential to a better understanding of the role played by the chiral structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "experimentally , an indirect indication of the modification of hadron properties in the medium has been provided by the dilepton production measurements in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , like for example , experiments from ceres@xcite and helios@xcite collaborations .",
    "however , the interpretation in terms of a reduction of the @xmath1 mass is still controversial .",
    "recently , new experiments using proton - induced nuclear reactions@xcite , or @xmath2 reactions@xcite have provided a more clear experimental signature of the in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in particular , the modification in nuclei of the @xmath0 meson has been investigated in photoproduction experiments by the taps collaboration@xcite and its mass was found to be @xmath3 ( stat)@xmath4(syst ) mev at 0.6 times the saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "the same order of magnitude , a 9% decrease of the in - medium @xmath0 mass at saturation , has been observed by naruki et al.@xcite in 12 gev proton - nucleus reactions ( e325/kek ) .    on the other hand , experimental indications of the in - medium modification of the quark condensate , @xmath5 ,",
    "can be obtained , for example , in experiments on deeply bound pionic atoms .",
    "indeed , by deducing the isovector @xmath6 interaction parameter in the pion - nucleus potential from the binding energy and width of deeply bound 1s states of @xmath7 in heavy nuclei , the in - medium pion decay constant , @xmath8 , can be extracted@xcite .",
    "the quark condensate is then connected to @xmath9 through the gell - mann - oaks-@xmath10nner relation .",
    "the observed enhancement of the isovector @xmath6 interaction parameter over the free @xmath6 value indicates a reduction of the pion decay constant in the medium which was found@xcite to be @xmath11 at saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view , starting from the assumption of harada and yamawaki@xcite on the  vector manifestation  of chiral symmetry in which a hidden local symmetry theory is matched to qcd , brown and rho proposed@xcite that , up to the saturation density , the vector meson mass in medium , @xmath12 , scales according to the approximative relation : @xmath13 ^{1/2}$ ] ( where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the in - medium and vacuum quark condensates ) . in quite different frameworks , like ,",
    "for example , in finite density qcd sum rule calculations@xcite or in the nambu jona - lasinio model ( njl)@xcite , the relation between the in - medium vector meson mass and quark condensate is not so clear and thus more complicated to handle .    the recent experimental data , like those previously mentioned , should provide stringent tests for the models and for the relation between the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass and quark condensate .",
    "an indication on the consequences of these new constraints could be obtained by enforcing them in quark models incorporating the most prominent features of qcd . in this context",
    ", the njl model@xcite appears as a good candidate since it allows a dynamical description of both the breaking of chiral symmetry and of the modification of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass .    in this work , we have determined the dependence of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass on the quark condensate in a njl model constrained by in - medium meson properties in accordance with recent experimental data .",
    "in addition to the usual four - quark interactions , we have included eight - quark terms in the njl lagrangian .",
    "the parameters of this model have been determined using the meson properties in the vacuum as well as in the medium through the pion decay constant and @xmath16 meson mass .",
    "more particularly , the in - medium pion decay constant has been constrained by the value obtained in an experiment on deeply bound pionic atoms@xcite and we have fixed the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass to the experimental values determined by the taps collaboration@xcite or by the e325 experiment at kek@xcite .",
    "these in - medium changes of meson properties arise from dynamical chiral symmetry restoration at the quark mean - field - rpa level as well as from more complicated quark - gluon excitations usually parametrized in terms of many - body hadronic interactions . considering the importance of the role played by the chiral structure of the qcd vacuum , concerning the @xmath0 meson mass and the pion decay constant",
    ", we made the assumption that , to leading order in nuclear density , the main contribution comes from dynamical chiral symmetry restoration at the quark mean - field - rpa level .",
    "our results will be compared to several scaling laws and in particular to that of brown and rho .",
    "we consider the following chirally invariant two - flavor njl lagrangian@xcite up to eight - quark interaction terms :    @xmath17 q+g_{1}\\left [ ( \\overline{q}q)^{2}+(\\overline{q}i\\gamma _ { 5}% { \\bf \\tau } q)^{2}\\right ] -g_{2}(\\overline{q}\\gamma _ { \\mu } q)^{2 }   \\label{njl } \\\\ & & + g_{3}\\left [ ( \\overline{q}q)^{2}+(\\overline{q}i\\gamma _ { 5}{\\bf \\tau } % q)^{2}\\right ] ( \\overline{q}\\gamma _ { \\mu } q)^{2}+g_{4}\\left [ ( \\overline{q}% q)^{2}+(\\overline{q}i\\gamma _ { 5}{\\bf \\tau } q)^{2}\\right ] ^{2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 denotes the quark field with two flavor ( @xmath19 ) and three color ( @xmath20 ) degrees of freedom and @xmath21 is the diagonal matrix of the current quark masses ( here in the isospin symmetric case ) .",
    "the second and third terms of eq.[njl ] represent local four - quark interactions while those proportional to @xmath22 and @xmath23 are eight - quark interactions .",
    "let us recall that , in two - flavor models , the thooft six fermion interaction term can be rewrited in terms of the four - quark interactions considered here@xcite .",
    "we have not considered the term @xmath24 since , as in the nucleonic njl model@xcite , it leads to a violation of the causality at high density .",
    "the dirac equation for a quark in mean - field approximation is given by :    @xmath25 q=0 ,   \\label{dir}\\ ] ]    which defines a dynamical constituent - quark mass :    @xmath26    generated by a strong scalar interaction of the quark with the dirac vacuum . in the gap equation ( eq.[gap ] ) , the quark condensate @xmath14 can be written as :    @xmath27    where here tr denotes traces over color , flavor and spin . in eq.[qqbs ] , @xmath28 represents the in - medium quark propagator defined as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the quark fermi momentum .",
    "the baryonic density is related to the total quark density by @xmath32 .",
    "the quark condensate is divergent due to the loop integrals and requires an appropriate regularization procedure .",
    "as many authors@xcite , we introduce a three - momentum cutoff @xmath33 which has the least impact on medium parts of the regularized integrals , in particular at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "thus , after the regularization procedure , the quark condensate is given at each density by :    @xmath34    as usual , the @xmath35 meson mass is obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation in the quark - antiquark channel .",
    "first , we define the quark - antiquark polarization operator in the @xmath0 channel by :    @xmath36 \\label{pola } \\\\ & = & \\left ( -g^{\\mu \\nu } + \\frac{q^{\\mu } q^{\\upsilon } } { q^{2}}\\right ) \\pi _ { \\omega } ( q^{2 } ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is given by eq.[pro ] . using the same regularization procedure as for the quark condensate ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath38    the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass , @xmath39 , is then determined by the pole structure of the @xmath40-matrix , i.e. by the condition :    @xmath41    we also need the pion mass and decay constant to adjust the model parameters . in the pseudo - scalar channel",
    ", the polarization reads : @xmath42 with    @xmath43    the in - medium @xmath44 meson mass , @xmath45 , and decay constant , @xmath46 , are then given respectively by :    @xmath47    @xmath48    where the in - medium pion - quark - quark coupling constant , @xmath49 , is obtained by :    @xmath50 _ { q^{2}=m_{\\pi } ^{*2}}^{-1}.   \\label{res}\\ ] ]",
    "we have six free parameters : the cutoff @xmath51 , the bare quark mass @xmath52 , and the coupling constants @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as usual",
    ", we have used for the fitting procedure the three following constraints : the pion mass @xmath55 mev , the pion decay constant @xmath56 mev and the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath57 mev in vacuum . since additional constraints like , for example , the value of the quark condensate in vacuum , do not allow to determine the cutoff @xmath51 unambiguously , as often done@xcite , we have considered several values for @xmath51 or equivalently several values of the in - vacuum constituent quark mass , @xmath58 , values ranging between @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 mev .",
    "such a rather large mass prevents the @xmath0 meson to be unstable against decay into a quark - antiquark pair since @xmath39 is always lower than @xmath61 for every density .",
    "note that smaller constituent quark masses can be obtained in njl models which take the confinement into account by including polyakov loops@xcite or using a confining interaction@xcite in the lagrangian .",
    "as already mentioned , in addition to these in - vacuum constraints , we have also chosen to take into account recent experimental results which provide constraints in the medium .",
    "in particular , we have fixed @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the saturation density of nuclear matter ) in accordance with what is obtained in experiments on deeply bound pionic atoms@xcite .",
    "moreover , the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass has been constrained to reproduce the experimental central value obtained either by the taps collaboration@xcite , @xmath64 mev , or by the e325 experiment at kek@xcite , @xmath65 mev .",
    "thus , two families of parametrization sets denoted respectively by taps and kek will be considered .",
    "note that once @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath8 , @xmath69 and @xmath58 are fixed , all the parameters are determined unambiguously .",
    "the results are shown on fig.1 where we have plotted @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 for the two parametrization sets taps and kek .",
    "note that @xmath72 corresponds to a baryonic density close to the saturation one .",
    "the shaded areas correspond to values of the @xmath0 meson mass for a constituent quark mass ranging from 400 mev to 500 mev .",
    "as we can see , these areas are rather narrow and the results are thus only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath58 used .    in order to determine an approximate form for the relation between the vector meson mass and the quark condensate , we have considered scaling laws of the general form : @xmath73 ^{\\alpha } .",
    "\\label{sca}\\ ] ] any value of @xmath74 can be considered but we have chosen to show here the results for @xmath75 which corresponds to the brown and rho scaling and for neighboring values : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    the full lines on fig.1 represent the scaling laws given by eq.[sca ] for @xmath76 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . a rather good agreement with the case @xmath75 corresponding to the brown and rho scaling law",
    "is obtained for the taps parametrization set while the kek result clearly favours @xmath76 .",
    "assuming eq.[sca ] for the scaling law , this result can be understood since to leading order @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the @xmath6 sigma term .",
    "the taps or kek results can then be used to determine the product @xmath84 obtained by eliminating the quark condensate in @xmath85 . using the value @xmath86 mev",
    "obtained in the njl model for @xmath87 mev , the taps and kek results provide respectively @xmath88 close to @xmath78 and @xmath89 in agreement with our full calculation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental values of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass are not determined unambiguously .",
    "in particular , the taps collaboration obtained a rather large uncertainty including statistical and systematical errors . by taking into account such an uncertainty in our calculation",
    ", we have found that the scaling law ( eq.[sca ] ) with @xmath77 is clearly ruled out but the case @xmath76 is not totally excluded .",
    "however , note that the central value of the taps result clearly favours @xmath75 .",
    "let us now determine how the quark condensate and the @xmath0 meson mass depend on the baryonic density for central values of the constituent quark mass , i.e. for @xmath90 mev , respectively for the taps and kek parametrizations .",
    "the parameters of the njl model are then @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the taps parametrization and @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the kek one .",
    "let us mention that , whatever the parametrization considered , the model provides a quark condensate in the vacuum @xmath101 mev in good agreement with the lattice calculations : @xmath102 mev @xcite and a critical density close to four times the saturation one .",
    "on fig.2 , we have plotted @xmath103 ( solid curves ) for the two parametrizations taps and kek as well as @xmath104 ^{\\alpha } $ ] for @xmath105 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath76 ( dot - dashed curve ) , as a function of the dimensionless baryonic density @xmath106 .",
    "as we can see , the density dependences of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass obtained with the taps and kek  parametrizations lead to a drop close to 10% at saturation density ( 9% for kek and 12% for taps ) .",
    "as already discussed , to a good level of approximation , the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass determined using the kek  result varies as a function of the baryonic density like the third root of the quark condensate . on the other hand , using the taps result , the density dependence of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass is not very much different from the square root of the quark condensate reflecting the fact that the results follow approximately the brown and rho scaling law up to the saturation density .",
    "we have determined the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass and quark condensate in a njl model with eight quark interaction terms .",
    "the parameters of this model have been determined using the meson properties in the vacuum but also in the medium through the value of the pion decay constant obtained in experiments on deeply bound pionic atoms as well as the @xmath0 meson mass measured either by the taps collaboration or by the e325/kek experiment . when the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass is constrained to the experimental data obtained by the taps collaboration , the brown and rho scaling law",
    "is approximately recovered . on the other hand ,",
    "when the kek result is used , the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass varies rather like the third root of the quark condensate .",
    "however , in both cases , this corresponds to a drop of the @xmath0 meson mass at saturation density close to 10% , a result which is lower than those found in qcd sum rule calculations where a decrease close to 15 - 25% is generally obtained@xcite ."
