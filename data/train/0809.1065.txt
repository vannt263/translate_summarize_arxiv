    "the nature and evolution of galaxy clusters offers an independent and complementary probe of cosmology to those of the cosmic microwave background @xcite or supernova ( e.g. permlmutter & schmidt 2003 ) . theoretical work ( e.g. haiman ,",
    "mohr & holder 2001 ) has shown that large surveys of clusters to reasonably high redshift ( @xmath6 ) can not only provide these much needed constraints , but can , through the use of information such as the spatial distribution of clusters , be made `` self - calibrating '' - _ if _ the evolution of cluster structure can be parameterized ( hu 2003 , majumdar & mohr 2003 ) , and _ if _ the scatter between cluster mass and observables ( luminosity , temperature ) is understood for clusters _ at the survey detection threshold_.    future x - ray surveys or sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) surveys , such as the south pole telescope ( spt ) , and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , will be designed to detect @xmath7 clusters to high redshift within a limited sky area and will not sample very many local clusters , or obtain very high physical resolution data . however , both of these characteristics are vital in order to establish the zero - redshift baseline from which we can then evaluate the global evolution of cluster scaling laws and structure , and calibrate possible systematic effects induced by potentially complex astrophysics .    in this paper",
    "we describe the results of an effort to utilize existing x - ray cluster data , and new observations by the _ suzaku _",
    "( jaxa / nasa ) mission to add to the existing body of work on the low redshift population of clusters ( e.g. henry 2000 ; reiprich & bohringer 2002 ; ikebe et al .",
    "specifically , we present the results of a _ suzaku _ survey of 14 nearby , x - ray luminous , clusters that have otherwise _ never _ been observed in a direct , pointed x - ray observation with earlier , spectrally sensitive instruments .",
    "our motivation is to increase the robustness of the local cluster temperature function at _ lower _ masses , which are typical of the mass threshold of the majority of likely future x - ray and sze cluster surveys .",
    "the range of masses probed by this data combined with pre - existing data ( a total , complete , sample of 61 objects ) is approximately @xmath8@xmath9 m@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we therefore bracket the expected low mass limit of future surveys , all of which are designed to probe to @xmath12 m@xmath10 ( locally for the x - ray , and across essentially all redshifts for spt / act ) . for modern cosmological tests based on the form of @xmath13 ( the number of clusters per unit redshift above a mass @xmath14 , c.f .",
    "haiman , mohr & holder 2001 ) , the _ only _ theoretical requirement is a precise understanding of the scatter in mass around the detection threshold ( e.g. x - ray flux limit ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : sample ] , we compile the local , flux - limited , complete sample . in   [ sec : data ] , we describe the suzaku data , and the spectral analysis method .",
    "we also present spectral fitting result for the 14 clusters . in ",
    "[ sec : t_l ] , we fit the @xmath5 relation in two different ways . in   [ sec : xtf ] , we describe our procedures for computing the xtf and present our results .",
    "we also make a comparison with previous results . in ",
    "[ sec : conclude ] , we briefly summarize our conclusions and the implications of this work . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a spatially flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , with the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "our sample is derived from the rosat brightest cluster sample ( bcs ) ( ebeling et al 1998 ) .",
    "the bcs is based on a pure x - ray flux selection criterion using the rosat all - sky survey data . in the northern celestial hemisphere",
    "the bcs is ( in parallel with the reflex survey in the south , boehringer et al .",
    "2001 ) the most complete , flux limited sample of low redshift clusters to - date .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the luminosity versus redshift for bcs clusters ; the flux limit is @xmath18 erg s@xmath1 @xmath3 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) and all objects have galactic latitudes @xmath19 , and redshifts @xmath20 . for the local cluster sample proposed here",
    "we have chosen a subset of the bcs with a flux limit of @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 @xmath3 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) and a redshift limit of @xmath22 ( shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "making this flux and redshift cut maximizes the number of objects that have prior x - ray pointed imaging spectroscopy data while minimizing the number of new datasets required to complete a statistically useful sample .",
    "for example , the flux limit required to ensure a 100% completeness in preexisting spectroscopic data is @xmath23 and would result in a sample of only 20 clusters , with only 3 of these with @xmath24 erg s@xmath1 , compared to 18 below this luminosity in our sample .",
    "our chosen redshift constraint ensures that our sample is in the local universe , minimizing any redshift dependent variation / scatter in the l - t relation and xtf which are to be calculated .",
    "we note that our flux limit is slightly lower than the @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 @xmath3 limit of ikebe et al ( 2002 , hereafter i02 ) , although their fluxes were recomputed from the rosat data and are therefore slightly different ( see also reiprich & bohringer 2002 ) .",
    "our final sample contains a total of 61 objects ( see below ) , 14 of which we have observed in _ suzaku _ pointed observations (  3 ) .",
    "_ suzaku _ is japan s fifth x - ray astronomy mission , and is equipped with an x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) .",
    "the 14 clusters identified as having no existing pointed x - ray imaging spectroscopy data were observed using the suzaku xis over an approximately 12 month period from 2006 - 2007 .",
    "table 1 summarizes these observations .",
    "the suzaku xis consists of four co - aligned x - ray ccds ( koyama et al .",
    "three of these are front - illuminated ( xis0,2,3 ) , the other is back - illuminated ( xis1 ) .",
    "the ccds are mounted at the focus of four independent x - ray telescopes ( xrt ) .",
    "each ccd is @xmath26 pixels , and covers an image region of @xmath27 on the sky .",
    "the psf of the xrt has a half power diameter of  @xmath28 .",
    "sensitivity is in the energy range of 0.2 - 12 kev .",
    "exposure times were chosen to ensure that approximately 15,000 xis counts in _ total _ ( 3 fi @xmath29 1 bi ) were obtained in the cluster core region for each object .",
    "a ratio of flux in the core to the total flux ( integrated to infinity for a @xmath30 mean emission profile ) is a constant 29% .",
    "the estimated core flux from the bcs was then further reduced by 50% to allow for vignetting of a diffuse source across the xis f.o.v .",
    "not all of the 14 clusters were observed by all 4 cameras , 5 clusters ( z8852 , a2665 , a2495 , a2249 and a566 ) were not observed by xis2 .",
    "we show xis0 ( raw ) images of the 14 clusters in fig . [",
    "fig : img ] together with brightness contours .",
    "the color and contour are both on a logarithmic scale , and the data are binned by a factor of 4 , then smoothed by gaussian with @xmath31 pixels .",
    "we start our spectral analysis from cleaned event files , using the standard cleaning process ( selection of the event grade and bad ccd column , disposal of non - observational intervals , and removal of hot and flickering pixels ) .",
    "we then accumulate the spectra within a radius of 7.2 arcmin of the nominal cluster center ( the peak of surface brightness ) using the `` xselect '' ftool .",
    "the spectrum is rebinned by a factor of 8 so that there are sufficient events in every energy bin for robust fitting .",
    "blank sky spectra are used as the background , and subtracted from the cluster spectrum .",
    "the net exposure time of blank sky spectra is 96.1 ks .",
    "the galactic foreground emission is ignored .",
    "this is justified by the fact that our clusters are all hot ( @xmath32 kev as we will see below ) , and the galactic latitudes of suzaku clusters and blank sky are all over 20 degrees . thus the amount of galactic emission over the relevant energy range ( i.e. where the largest photon count is ) is very small in comparison .",
    "we generate the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) and ancillary response file ( arf ) by using the tools `` xisrmfgen '' and `` xissimarfgen '' included in the heasoft package ( ishisaki et al .",
    "the xis image is used as the input surface brightness distribution for `` xissimarfgen '' .",
    "the heasoft package used is heasoft 6.3.0 .",
    "note that we use a fixed angular size for accumulating spectra , i.e. higher redshift clusters are sampled with larger physical radius .",
    "recent observations indicate that cluster temperature profiles generally decline with radius outside the core ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2005 , leccardi & molendi 2008 ) , this implies that in our analyses hotter regions are weighted preferentially for lower redshift clusters .",
    "we therefore adopt a phenomenological cluster model that is a reasonable , albeit approximate , fit to currently observed temperature profiles in order to estimate this uncertainty ( reid & spergel 2006 , shang et al .",
    "2008 in preparation ) .",
    "we find that the mean emission weighted temperature within 7.2 arcmin of a cluster center and that outside the core ( @xmath33 0.05 - 0.1 virial radius ) differ up to 4% for z=0.0341 ( the lowest redshift in our sample ) and z=0.0980 ( highest redshift in our sample ) .",
    "the deviation of these temperatures from the mean temperature within @xmath34 is also smaller than 4% . while there may be an effect we therefore consider it to be smaller than other sources of experimental uncertainty - either systematic or random .",
    "ideally the measured intracluster gas temperature would correspond to the virial temperature of cluster .",
    "however , clusters are not always isothermal .",
    "merging , cooling , and phenomena such as agn outflows can disrupt isothermality .",
    "approximately half of all systems exhibit evidence for being cooling core clusters ( ccc ) , which have a measurably cooler gas component in their central regions ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "the cooling core can contribute a significant fraction of the luminosity of cluster , so a simple emission - weighted mean temperature may be considerably lower than the true virial temperature .",
    "excision of the central emission is non - trivial in the _ suzaku _ data due to the psf .",
    "a more appealing solution is to adopt a suitable spectral model .    in our analyses , we test both single temperature ( 1 t ) and two temperature ( 2 t ) models as fits to the net spectrum . a 1 t model should provide a better fit to non - cooling core , isothermal clusters ( nccc ) , while a 2 t model should offer an improved fit to a ccc .",
    "the 2 t model represents 2 independent gas components : a cool component from the core and a hotter component which should be more representative of the virial temperature .",
    "the mekal model is taken as our plasma code , as implemented in xspec version 12.3.1x .",
    "we simultaneously fit the spectra accumulated from the different ccd cameras .",
    "the energy range used is restricted to 0.5 kev to 7 kev to mitigate some of the contamination issues at lower energies and to minimize the background at higher energies relative to the cluster emission .",
    "we also tried ignoring the energy band around the si k - edge ( 1.825 - 1.840 kev ) due to a potentially anomalous response in that band , however the difference in the resulting temperature is negligible ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the temperatures are tied together , wheras the normalizations are treated independently for different cameras ( however , the ratios between the normalization of the hot component and that of the cool component in the 2 t model are also tied ) .",
    "we try both fixing the metal abundance and setting it as a free parameter .",
    "when the abundance is fixed , the value is set to be 0.3 of solar .",
    "the galactic hi column density is fixed at the value obtained from the lab survey ( kalberla et al .",
    "we also enforce an initial upper limit to the hot component:@xmath36 in our 2 t model , since it is assumed to represent the temperature of the majority of the icm gas .",
    "the results of the spectral fits are summarized in table [ tbl : temperature ] ( metallicity fixed ) and table [ tbl : metallicity ] ( metallicity as a free parameter ) .",
    "example spectra are also shown for clusters a1800 and z8276 , together with 1 t model fit ( metallicity fixed ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "the fits are good overall , except for the low energy range ( @xmath37 kev ) and some residual fe features around 1 kev and 6.7 kev for z8276 .",
    "we suspect the mismatch below 1 kev is due to uncertainty in contamination in the optical blocking filter of suzaku xis ( sato et al .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty by fitting the spectrum using the energy range 1 kev-7 kev , and comparing the result with that from 0.5 kev - 7 kev . for the majority of our clusters ,",
    "the temperature difference is small ( @xmath38 ) , but for a few such as ugc03957 and a2495 , the best fit temperature could drop by up to 7% .",
    "the remaining fe feature in z8276 appears to be because we fix the metallicity to 0.3 @xmath39 , while the true value must be higher than this .",
    "this feature disappears when we thaw the metallicity .",
    "the resulting temperature is only slightly altered ( see table [ tbl : temperature ] and table [ tbl : metallicity ] ) .",
    "we also tried replacing the mekal model with the vmekal model , and allowing he and fe abundance to vary , again the difference in temperature is very small ( @xmath35 ) .    to choose the most likely virial temperature of the cluster from our 1 t and 2 t models , we perform an f - test that indicates which model is more applicable for the cluster by comparing @xmath40 and the number of free parameters .. if including another temperature component ( 2 t model ) gives rise to a more than 99% significant improvement",
    ", the higher temperature ( @xmath36 ) from the 2 t model is chosen as the temperature for the cluster , which also implies it is a ccc .",
    "otherwise , the 1 t model temperature is picked as representing the virial temperature , and the cluster could be viewed as nccc .",
    "however , there is one system : a2665 , where although the 2 t model passes the f - test , we still choose the result from 1 t model . in this case @xmath36 from the 2 t model for a2665 is more than 3 times the temperature obtained from the 1 t model fit , and the normalization of the hot component is much smaller than that of cool component . for a typical ccc , it should be larger or at least of the same order .",
    "so we do not believe that @xmath36 is actually representive of the virial temperature for a2665 . the model chosen for the virial temperature",
    "is indicated in bold face in table [ tbl : temperature ] and table [ tbl : metallicity ] .",
    "the temperatures shown in table [ tbl : temperature ] are used in our analyses below .",
    "comparing the results in table [ tbl : temperature ] and table [ tbl : metallicity ] , we see that the temperature generally varies only a little after setting the metallicity as a free parameter instead of fixing it at 0.3 solar .",
    "the one exception is ugc03957 .",
    "this system is better fit as a nccc after we thaw the metallicity parameter , it also has the highest metal abundance in our _ suzaku _ survey ( 0.59 @xmath41 ) .    to check whether the _ suzaku _ temperatures obtained using our procedure are consistent with published value from other missions , we also performed our analysis on 3 clusters ( a1060 , a2218 and a1795 ) with well established temperatures in the literature from multiple missions ( e.g. asca , chandra , xmm ) .",
    "our results appear to match previous results quite well in both nccc and ccc cases .",
    "a detailed comparison is listed in table [ tbl : observation ] .",
    "below are a few notes for each cluster .",
    "a1060 : with z=0.00114 , it is one of the nearest abell clusters .",
    "various observations show that it has uniform temperature and abundance distribution , and is therefore thought to be in a dynamically relaxed state ( tamura et al .",
    "1996 , furusho et al .",
    "2001 , hayakawa et al .",
    "2004 , hayakawa et al . 2006 ) .",
    "although recent observations indicate that the temperature profile has a steep drop in the outer regions ( sato et al .",
    "2007 ) , the variation within 7 arcmin is small .",
    "obviously , a simple 1 t model is sufficient and perfectly suitable for such a case .",
    "all temperature measurements give quite close results : @xmath42kev from asca(furusho et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath43 kev from chandra ( hayakawa et al .",
    "2004 ) , @xmath44 kev from xmm - newton .",
    "our result is also in perfect agreement with them .",
    "a2218 : residing at z=0.175 , this cluster is further away than any object in our sample .",
    "various observations suggest it is at a later merger stage with a centrally peaked and azimuthally asymmetric temperature map ( govoni et al .",
    "2004 ; machacek et al .",
    "2002 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ) . a 1 t model is preferred for this cluster",
    "since there is no cooling flow in the center , and our result is in close agreement with previous measurements .",
    "a1795 : is a strong cooling flow cluster at z=0.0634 .",
    "different measurements and different treatments of the cooling flow give very different results , varying over a wide range of 5.3 - 7.8 kev .",
    "the low end of the measured temperature range ( 5.3kev ) is from 1 t models that do not take into account of cooling flow .",
    "but even within the analyses that explicitly considered the cooling flow ( fitting with a 2 t model , cooling flow model , or excising the cooling flow region ) , the range of results still appears to be large . fortunately , recent results seem to stablilize around 6 kev . among them , allen et al . ( 2001 ) extracted the temperature from asca data using 5 different models .",
    "their result is summarized as follows : @xmath45kev from a 1 t model ( absorbing column density fixed ) , @xmath46kev from a 1 t model ( absorbing column density as a free parameter ) , @xmath47kev from a constant cooling flow model , @xmath48kev from a 2 t model , an d @xmath49kev from a isothermal cooling flow model .",
    "an incomplete list of other measurements includes : @xmath50kev from chandra ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2005 , 1 t model with central 70 kpc excluded ) , @xmath51kev from xmm - newton ( arnaud et al . 2001 ,",
    "1 t fit with cooling flow region excluded ) .",
    "our result ( @xmath52kev is in good agreement with these recent measurements .    the rosat fluxes used to define our sample are computed from raw counts assuming a spectral model and gas temperature derived in an iterative fashion from an assumed @xmath5 relation ( ebeling et al .",
    "we have therefore checked whether our spectroscopically derived temperatures alter the cluster flux sufficiently in any case to cause systems to fall below our flux limit .",
    "we find that the fluxes vary only some 1 - 2 % even if the temperature changes by a factor of 2 .",
    "since this is small compared to the rosat count rate uncertainty ( around 15% ) it is unlikely to bias the sample either by excluding or including systems at the flux limit .",
    "the rosat flux is therefore shown in table [ tbl : sample ] , but luminosities have been computed using our updated temperatures where appropriate .",
    "57 clusters in table [ tbl : sample ] have measured / published temperatures , which is 93% of our sample .",
    "34 clusters were measured by asca , 14 were measured by suzaku , 6 by einstein or exosat , 2 by chandra , 1 by xmm - newton , 4 used estimated temperature from our @xmath5 relation which is to be calulated . when a cluster has temperature measurements by several instruments , our first choice is to adopt the asca measurement in order to minimize any instrumental systematics .",
    "more than half of the clusters in the sample have asca observations , in addition the asca sis is very similar to the _ suzaku _ xis . our second choice is to use chandra or xmm - newton for their accuracy , lastly we choose others . if the spectrum of a cluster was fitted with different models in the literature , we choose 2 t model fits over cooling flow models to ensure consistency with our analysis .",
    "our sample differs from that of the hiflugcs ( reiprich&bhringer 2002 ) used by i02 in the follwing aspects : hiflugcs covers both northern and southern skies , ours only covers the northern sky ; hiflugcs uses a flux limit of @xmath53 , while ours is a factor of two lower ; the two samples are constructed based on rosat flux estimated in slightly different ways .",
    "the x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath5 ) relation for galaxy clusters has long been used as a probe of their physics and evolution . in this section",
    ", we fit our data above with the following relation , @xmath54 the @xmath5 relationship has an intrinsic scatter in addition to any measurement errors . a common way of dealing with this kind of problem in curve fitting is to employ the bces(@xmath55 ) estimator(akritas & bershady 1996 ) .",
    "however , the slope derived from the bces estimator depends on the measurement error .",
    "in fact , the data with the largest errors / scatter are effectively given more weight in the fit than the data with smaller errors / scatter , contrary to naive expectations . in an attempt to mitigate this inherent bias",
    "we also performed a modified @xmath56 fit which takes intrinsic scatter into account explicitly .",
    "our @xmath56 is defined as the following : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the intrinsic scatter , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the measurement variances in @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath58 is chosen so that the minimum reduced @xmath56 is 1 .",
    "the results of both a standard bces fit and that of our modified @xmath56 are listed in table [ tbl : fit ]",
    ".    as we can see , the two methods are roughly consistent for our data , but the @xmath56 fit has the advantage that small error measurements are given more weight in the fitting .",
    "this approach yields slightly lower power law indices for the @xmath5 relation .    in the analyses described below , we use the result from the @xmath56 fitting . the fits together with data",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .    in the same way we also fit the relation between bolometric luminosity and temperature .",
    "these results are also presented in table [ tbl : fit ] , the measured slope steepens to @xmath63 . the conversion between band and bolometric luminosity",
    "is computed using the mekal plasma code and measured temperature . compared with high redshift measurements ( e.g. ota et al .",
    "2006 ) , the slopes match within the uncertainty , while our normalization is smaller , which is in general agreement with the positive redshift evolution of luminosity that has been suggested by previous works ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2002 , lumb et al .",
    "2004 , kotov & vikhlinin 2005 ) .",
    "as a first step towards using our cluster sample to provide a complementary zero - redshift calibration point for cosmological studies ( alongside , for example , reiprich & bhringer 2002 , ikebe et al .",
    "2002 ) we have made a preliminary assessment of the cluster x - ray temperature function ( xtf ) .",
    "the number density of clusters hotter than a temperature @xmath62 is given by , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the maximum comoving volume where a cluster of temperature @xmath62 would be detected .",
    "following many previous works , we assume that @xmath66 follows a normal distribution with mean value given by the @xmath5 relation above , and with variance @xmath67 . @xmath68 where the @xmath69 is the maximum search volume for a cluster with temperature @xmath62 and luminosity @xmath61 . @xmath70 where the @xmath71 is the solid angle sky coverage of the survey ( equal to 4.14 for the rosat bcs ) , and @xmath72 .",

    "@xmath74 is constrained by the flux limit , and is computed by solving the following equation , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the observed luminosity after applying a k - correction , and @xmath77 is the flux limit of our sample , which is @xmath78 . since we assume a flat universe model , the comoving distance takes a simple form , @xmath79    the calculated @xmath80 is listed in table [ tbl : sample ] .",
    "we plot the cumulative xtf in fig .",
    "[ fig : xtf ] together with the results from previous works .",
    "we find general agreement with earlier measurements at temperatures above @xmath81 kev . at lower temperatures we see a slightly lower normalization than either the i02 or henry ( 2000 ) measurements .",
    "a particular feature in our cluster sample , that is also evident to some extent in the i02 and henry ( 2000 ) samples , is a small gap or deficit of clusters in the temperature range of @xmath82 kev .",
    "this is also apparent in figure 4 and in figure 6 where we plot cluster temperature versus redshift for our sample . in particular ,",
    "the _ suzaku _ measurements appear grouped towards 4 - 4.5 kev across a range in redshift .",
    "although this may suggest a systematic issue in our temperature estimates we have also plotted in figure 6 the results of our identical analysis of _ suzaku _ data on the archived objects a1060 , a2218 , and a1795 ( table 4 ) , which agree very well with pre - existing measurements from other missions , and show no obvious biases . this gap is also apparent in the pre - existing temperature measurements that make up the rest of our sample . although the i02 and henry 2000 cumulative xtf s also show a similar feature it is notable that the markevitch ( 1998 ) xtf does not .",
    "all samples have very similar redshift limits ( i.e. @xmath83 with very few objects beyond @xmath22 ) .",
    "markevitch ( 1998 ) derives asca temperatures by explicitly removing emission from any cool cores ( previously ascribed to large cooling flows ) , whereas i02 and our present work employ a similar 2t/1 t spectral approach and henry ( 2000 ) used many collated temperatures .",
    "it is therefore possible that systematic effects in temperature measurements are responsible for this feature .",
    "we do how ever believe that our 1t/2 t modeling approach should avoid any bias towards _ underestimating _ temperatures , since we do detect and reduce the contribution of any cool cores .",
    "it is of course possible that this feature is simply a statistical fluke , due to the finite sample size and @xmath5 scatter .",
    "indeed , there is a clear steepening in the cumulative xtf slope ( figure 5 ) at temperatures immediately below 4.5 kev compared that above 5.5 kev , indicating a slight  pile - up \" of objects cooler than 4.5 kev .",
    "if we naively average over the temperature range 2 - 8 kev then there are approximately 4.5 clusters per 0.5 kev bin .",
    "finding zero clusters in the 4.5 - 5 kev range ( see table 5 ) is therefore ( assuming poisson statistics ) significant at about a @xmath84 level .",
    "finding 10 clusters in the 4 - 4.5 kev range ( see table 5 ) is a positive deviation at about a @xmath85 level .",
    "taken together this suggests that while a statistical fluctuation can not be ruled out , it would certainly be well outside a 2-@xmath86 event .",
    "it is also possible that this is a manifestation of cosmic variance due to large - scale structures within the finite volume of our sample ( which is distinct from a pure statistical fluke ) .",
    "this is something that has plagued very early efforts to make cosmological methods with galaxy clusters ( e.g. edge et al .",
    "the apparent dearth of objects at @xmath87 ( figures 1 and 6 ) is likely a consequence of this , although this does not obviously map to the deficit of 4.5 - 5.5 kev clusters .",
    "we have conducted an x - ray galaxy cluster survey of 14 systems using _",
    "suzaku_. these clusters are part of a statistically complete sample of 61 clusters in the local ( @xmath88 ) universe with @xmath89 erg s@xmath1 @xmath3 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) , in the northern celestial hemisphere .",
    "none of these 14 clusters have been observed previously in pointed x - ray observations , despite being luminous systems ( @xmath90 erg s@xmath1 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data is shown to be of high quality and enables robust imaging and spectral analyses to be made . a comparison of spectral analyses of _ suzaku _ data on 3 well known clusters ( not in our sample ) with those from earlier missions indicates no obvious biases either in the _ suzaku _ calibration or the analysis approach that we use .",
    "we present the first results of a spectral analysis of these 14 clusters with the aim of deriving gas temperatures that reflect the true virial temperature . to do this",
    "we employed a spectral modeling scheme that determines whether a one or two plasma temperature model is appropriate .",
    "two temperature models allow us to separate out the contribution of cooling cores in 7 of the clusters . combining the new _ suzaku _",
    "data with preexisting temperature data for the flux limited sample we obtain a dataset of 57 objects with spectroscopically confirmed gas temperatures and 4 objects for which pointed x - ray data is either not yet public or has not yet been analyzed .",
    "for these 4 systems we simply use estimated temperatures based on the @xmath5 relation , and note that their inclusion or exclusion has a negligible impact on our results .",
    "we have determined both the @xmath5 relation and the cumulative xtf for the full sample . in fitting the @xmath5 relationship with a power law",
    "we argue that the often used bces method can produce a power law index that is dependent on the actual measurement errors in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , owing to the weighting scheme employed .",
    "we have therefore also employed a modified @xmath40 fit that takes intrinsic scatter into account in an attempt to mitigate any bias in the fit .",
    "we find that this modified @xmath40 and the bces method are in quite close agreement , with power - law indices differing by @xmath91% and normalizations by @xmath92 % .",
    "the modified @xmath40 yields @xmath93 .",
    "the measured xtf is in close agreement with that of previous studies .",
    "obviously there is significant overlap in the actual clusters contained in all such works .",
    "however , our lower flux limit ( by a factor of 2 from , for example , i02 ) and the fact that 22% of our sample has never been studied in the x - ray before , helps reduce this problem . there is some evidence that our xtf is slightly lower at temperatures less than @xmath94 kev than the earlier measurements .",
    "this appears to be partially a consequence of a deficit of clusters in the range of 4.5 - 5.5 kev .",
    "we have considered several possible causes for this .",
    "these include ; a systematic bias in our spectral analyses , a statistical fluke , or a consequence of large - scale structure and cosmic variance in this very local sample .",
    "since a similar deficit is also apparent in two earlier xtf measurements ( i02 , henry ( 2000 ) ) it may be that a statistical or cosmic variance effect is the most likely .",
    "if local galaxy cluster samples are to be used to construct robust calibrations for future high - precision cosmological tests then it will be crucial to ensure that we understand the finite volume effects ( e.g. cosmic variance ) that may produce systematic biases .",
    "one solution will be to push measurements to slightly lower mass scales where clusters are more numerous .",
    "we have demonstrated that _",
    "suzaku _ is an excellent instrument for doing just that , by exploring the population of luminous , nearby , clusters that has nonetheless not yet been fully studied .",
    "we thank zoltn haiman and an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
