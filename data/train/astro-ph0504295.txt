    "arguably the most interesting feature of the ionised helical structure are the multitude of ` cometary ' knots inhabiting its inside surface . these have dense neutral cores ( meaburn et al 1992 , 1998 ; huggins et al 1992 ) with long ionised tails pointing radially away from the central star seen in superb detail in the hst images of odell & handron ( 1996 ) .    in the present paper ,",

    "a re - examination of these previous pv arrays revealed that the high excitation heii  6560  emission line , from an area of @xmath2  200  radius around the nebular core , was detected in this previous data .",

    "the heii  brightness profile from odell et al ( 2004 ) and that shown here for heii  6560  in fig .",

    "these observed profiles are intrinsically broadened by the 19 fine structural components spread between 6559.7696560.209which is @xmath4  20  range ( see the ` atomic line list ' in http://www.pa.uky.edu/  peter / atomic/ ) .

    "the heii  6560  profiles are further broadened by a ) the thermal motion of the 10@xmath13  k gas ( gaussian halfwidth = 10.7  ) b ) the effective instrumental halfwidth of 11  ( from measurements of the lamp lines ) c ) bulk turbulence in the emitting volume and d ) radial expansion of the same volume which is the parameter of particular interest .",
    "the corrected halfwidths in column 4 of table 1 are the observed halfwidths in column 3 corrected for both thermal and instrumental broadenings , for these are well  known , assuming that all broadening functions are gaussian .",
    "finally the relative heii  6560  profile brightnesses in column 5 are the mean values per increment for the whole of the line profiles along the incremental lengths in column 1 . the continuum emission adjacent to the heii  6560  line ( see fig .",
    "7 ) was subtracted in this process .",
    "the profiles from the last two incremental lengths listed in table  1 were so faint that only their relative surface brightnesses could be measured with significant accuracy .",

    "this range just excluded contamination by the stellar spectrum and gave the highest signal to noise ratio for the critical but faint heii  6560  line . a similar detection of heii  6560  emission was made in the ns spectrum ( not shown ) .",
    "the core of the central spherical volume of heii  6560  emission is surrounded , and partially coincident with , an inner shell of [ oiii ]  5007  emission whose emission peaks are separated by @xmath2 240 arcsec ( meaburn & white 1982 and see fig . 4 in odell et al 2004 ) .",
    "this shell can be seen clearly in the deep negative representation of the [ oiii ]  5007  image taken with the new technology telescope ( la silla ) in fig . 9 ( see meaburn et al 1998 for the technical details ) .",
    "spatially resolved [ oiii ]  5007  line profiles were obtained with mes combined with the aat along the 163 arcsec long e ",
    "w slit marked in fig .",
    "the integration time was 1800 s and slit width 70 @xmath8 m ( @xmath4 6  and 0.5 arcsec on the sky ) .",
    "again the technical details of this as yet unpublished observation are given in meaburn et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "added profiles were obtained for all blocks , 5 increments long , along the 512 ccd increments that covered the slit length .",
    "the separate velocity components in each of these profiles were simulated by gaussians whose centroids are shown in fig .",
    "9 . over the central star ( at 0 arcsec offset in fig .",
    "9 ) it can be seen that four velocity components in the [ oiii ]  5007  profiles are present ( i.e. at  = @xmath1460 , @xmath1442 , @xmath1417 and @xmath144 ) .",
    "the [ oiii ]  5007  line profile for an incremental length comparable to that used for the h@xmath1 , [ nii ]  6584  and heii  6560  profiles is also shown in fig .",
    "the cometary knots have dense , molecular heads ( meaburn et al 1992 and huggins et al 1992 ) with tails extending away from the central stars .",
    "odell et al ( fig .",
    "16  2004 ) and henry et al ( fig . 5 ",
    "1999 ) have revealed even more widespread system of headless ` spokes ' in the [ nii ]  emitting gas extending from the inner torus outwards in the bright nebulosity .",
    "henry et al ( 1999 ) showed them as parallel ridges of enhanced [ nii ]  emission by dividing their [ nii ]  image with their h@xmath1  one .",
    "an image of 1800 s duration through a 72    bandwidth filter centred on h@xmath1  + [ nii ]  was obtained with the ntt ( see walsh & meaburn 1993 ; meaburn et al 1998 for the technical details ) and is shown at high contrast in fig .",
    "the outer radial ` spokes ' can be seen to continue faintly inside the disk containing the cometary globules to within @xmath2  30  from the central star .",
    "they are seen to be radially distributed with respect to the central star and continuous in some cases with the more recently discovered , but similar features in the adajcent bright helical structure ( odell et al 2004 ; henry et al 1999 ) .",
    "for these reasons they are considered to be real and shown here at high contrast .",
    "obviously a deep , reasonably high resolution , image in the same emission lines is needed to confirm their presence for the image in fig .",
    "10 is not flat  fielded .",
    "however , these spokes are relevant to the understanding of cometary globule formation and knot evaporation .",
    "the presence of the heii  6560  volume close to the central star affects many of the theoretical ideas for the creation of planetary nebulae consequently its structure and motions should be quantified .",
    "the heii  4686  image of odell et al ( 2004 ) suggest that it is a spherical volume of @xmath2  180radius .",
    "this morphology is confirmed by the relative brightness distribution here in fig.6 .",
    "the widths of the heii  6560  line profiles when corrected for thermal and instrumental broadenings ( column 4 of table 1 ) have a maximum width of 26 @xmath12 2  near the central star with only a minor ( and uncertain ) decline in width up to 160 arcsec from this star . as this width",
    "will also contain the consequences of fine structural width and turbulent motions then the 13 @xmath12 2 is very much an upper limit to the radial expansion of the heii  6560  emitting volume .",
    "if turbulent motions of @xmath15 10  ( flows at the sound speed off globule surfaces for instance ) contribute to the line width in addition to a fine structural broadening component of @xmath2  6   then a global expansion of the heii  6560  emitting region would be @xmath3  12  .",
    "the non  gaussian shape of the heii  6560profile in fig . 8 could suggest that an expansion velocity near this upper limit is in fact present .",
    "the inner [ oiii ]  5007  emitting shell in fig .",
    "9 is co - existent with the outer , and faint , parts of the heii  6560  emitting volume .",
    "the splitting of 25  of the [ oiii ]  5007  profile over the central star , which is symmetrical around , undoubtably is caused by radial expansion of 12.5 @xmath12 1.0  of the inner [ oiii ]  5007  emitting shell .",
    "this value is now considered to be more realistic than the @xmath2 20  given in meaburn et al ( 1998 ) derived from fabry ",
    "perot observations in meaburn & white ( 1982 - one velocity component was misinterpreted ) .    incidentally , because this heii  6560  emitting region is relatively inert and so close to the central star , and because it is a single recombination line with a well known wavelength though complicated by fine structural components , a bi  product of the present heii  6560  profile measurements is a reliable value of the systemic heliocentric radial velocity ( ) for ngc 7293.as the mean observed central wavelength is 6560.053 @xmath12 0.015   ( mean of values in column 2 of table 1 ) and with the mean rest wavelength , with each fine structural component weighted by its relative brightness in table 2 , is 6560.128    and as  =  @xmath1424.3  on the date of observations then  = @xmath1427.1  @xmath12  2.0  when systematic calibration uncertainties are included .",
    "this is consistent with a previous , though less certain , value of  derived from the centroids of the split [ nii ]  6584  profiles over the central star ( meaburn et al 1998 ) : the [ nii ]  6584  components are not necessarily symmetric around .      the bright helical structure emitting [ nii ]",
    "6584  can be seen in meaburn & white ( 1982 ) and odell et al ( 2004 ) to be enclosing an ` outer ' [ oiii ]  5007  emitting shell , the ` inner ' [ oiii ]  5007  shell shown in fig . 9 as well as the central heii  6560  emitting volume ( see fig .",
    "it was proposed in meaburn et al ( 1998 ) that this helical structure could be a consequence of bi - polar lobes expanding from a toroidal ring , itself expanding radially .",
    "as odell et al ( 2004 ) challenged this assertion the kinematics and morphology of the [ nii ]  6584helical structure has been further explored using the xshape code developed by steffen , holloway & pedlar ( 1996 ) and harman ( 2001 ) .",
    "this numerical technique does not give a unique answer but does predict accurately the observed surface brightnesses and spatially resolved radial velocity shifts of emission lines for any predetermined structure .",
    "in the present case a starting point for this modelling is to identify as b and c the manifestation of the central toroid in the e  w pv array in fig .",
    "6 . these positions coincide with major brightness maxima and have radial velocities nearly symmetrically displaced from  = @xmath1427 .",
    "undoubtably the ionised inside surface of a larger , radially expanding , molecular toroid ( healey & huggins 1990 ) is being observed at an angle in agreement with odell et al ( 2004 ) . in the very simplest of bi ",
    "polar models the positions a and d in fig .",
    "6 are where these sight lines intersect the edges of the lobes .",
    "as the observed radial velocities at both of these positions are close to  this supposition is reasonable if it is assumed that lobe expansion is always proportional to the distance from the central star and along a vector pointing away from this centre .    the model shown in fig .",
    "11 is based on these assumptions and using the xshape code the predicted morphology is compared to the observed image from fig . 1 and the negative greyscale representations of both the observed n  s and e  w pv arrays of [ nii ]  6584  profiles from meaburn et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the positions a  d marked in fig . 6 are also shown .    in this model",
    "the tilt of the sightline to the nebular axis is 37 , the radial expansion of the toroid ( b & c ) is 14.25  and the expansion of the two lobes 24.5  along the bipolar axis .",
    "each lobe has the shape of an inverse ellipsoid ( sphere divided by an ellipse ) with semi ",
    "major axis of 490  and semi - minor 285 . to give the appearance of reality ,",
    "clumps are distributed randomly within the 3d grid with 0.0001 clumps per cubic arcsec .",
    "each clump has the form of a 3d gaussian with fwhm of 20 .",
    "the simulated image has been smoothed with a 10  wide gaussian to match the resolution in fig .",
    "the simulated pv arrays have been convolved with the 11  wide instrumental profile .",
    "a convincing , though obviously not perfect , fit of the model predictons to the salient features of the observed image and the two orthogonal pv arrays is demonstrated in fig .",
    "these observations and model can not accomodate the presence of two tilted rings as suggested by odell et al ( 2004 ) .    the model in fig .",
    "11 is only for the bright [ nii ]  6548 ,  6584  emitting helical structure which has its co emitting inner counterpart ( young et al 1999 ) .",
    "odell et al ( 2004 ) suggest that the inner ring ( whose edges are marked as b and c in fig .",
    "11 ) is an expanding disk as modelled here .",
    "however , they go on to suggest that the two adjacent bright arcs ( whose edges are at a and d respectively in fig",
    ". 11 ) are the manifestation of a single expanding disk expanding _ orthogonally _ to the central disk .",
    "they base this assertion soley on fig . 5 of young et al ( 1999 ) where an orthogonal range of velocities for a co ` outer arc ' is partially detected . the excellent morphological and kinematical fit of the model in fig .",

    "the nebulous n  e halo arc imaged by malin ( 1982 ) and see also speck et al ( 2002 ) and shown in fig .",
    "1b and fig .",
    "2 has a s - w counterpart which could suggest some form of bi  polar structure which is both larger and along a different axis to that proposed for the bright helical nebulosity .",

    "35 along slits 13 in fig . 2 , and those of walsh & meaburn ( 1987 )",
    "reveal behaviour not easily explained in a model involving classical three dimensional bi  polar lobes .",
    "for instance , although there is a systematic trend in radial velocity from the north of slit 2 (  = 0 ) to the southern end where  = @xmath1460 , which suggests some form of expansion , the bright northern edge would be expected at  = @xmath1426  in a simple bi ",
    "polar model.the eastern edge itself was shown to have complex velocity structure with an extreme velocity component at  =  @xmath1480  ( slit 3 in fig . 5 and also see walsh & meaburn 1987 ) .",
    "nevertheless , line spitting observed in slit positions 2 & 3 ( figs . 4 & 5 ) suggests the interpretation of these features as expanding lobes though not orthogonal to the central torus which is modelled in fig .",
    "a similar case is observed in ngc 2440 ( lpez et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that both this eastern and western halo structure could rather be both parts of a single expanding ring of ionised material . if so it must be oriented at a completely different angle to the central torus ( bc ) shown in fig .",
    "11 for the eastern edge has predominantly approaching radial velocities with respect to .",
    "if these reflect the radial expansion of the ring then its expansion could be as high as @xmath2  70  for an arbitary tilt of 45  to the sight line although the observed radial velocities do not unambiguously favour this ring model .",
    "more observations at similar spectral resolution , particularly of the south  western halo lobe , are required to investigate these propositions more fully .",
    "other features of the general halo of ngc 7293 have been seen previously ( e.g. odell et al 2004 ) but of potential interest is the faint jet  like feature in the sw , along pa 255 , but projecting back to the nebular core in the deep image in fig .",
    "a bow  shaped possible counter feature on the opposite side of the nebula is aligned with it .",
    "pne are a consequence of the sequence of events as a star of @xmath3 8 evolves through its red giant ( rg ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phases to finally become a white dwarf ( wd ) . in this sequence",
    "it is generally accepted that an initial rg wind , is followed by the more volatile and many times denser agb ` superwind ' ( with sporadic outbursts at 20 of ) which is then subjected to interaction with a high  speed wind ( several 1000 ) and becomes photo  ionised as the central star becomes a wd with a high surface temperature . at this point the circumstellar envelope becomes the embryo pn .",
    "the fast wind could then decline as the star becomes an older wd and the photoionised circumstellar envelope would then be described as an evolved pn .    the standard interacting winds",
    "( iw ) model ( kwok , purton & fitzgerald 1978 ; khan and west 1985 ; chu , kwitter & kaler 1993 ; balick & frank 2002 ) makes a theoretical attempt to explain the formation of the observed nebular structure and kinematics in pne during the transition of the stellar core from the post - agb to the wd stages . here , with smooth , isotropic , density distributions the fast wind forms an expanding pressure driven ( energy conserving ) bubble in the pre  cursor agb wind .",
    "a central volume of unshocked fast wind is surrounded by a shell of superheated ( 10@xmath16 k ) shocked wind which provides the gas pressure to form and accelerate a shell of shocked agb wind . within this model and with photo  ionisation dominant the latter expanding , low ",
    "ionisation , shell is characteristic of young pne .",
    "balick & frank ( 2002 ) emphasise that from observations of a large number of pne this model , although an excellent theoretical starting point , is very idealistic ; there are a multitude of phenomena within pne when the stars are in their post ",
    "agb phases that require more complex explanations ; lobes and disks expanding along separate axes being only two of many such complexities .",
    "the present kinematical observations of the undoubtably evolved pn , ngc 7293 , reported here could be consistent with the final stages of the iw model if it is assumed that the fast wind has now switched off .",
    "this possibility is made plausible by the absence of a direct observation of the fast wind in the stellar spectrum ( see sect .",
    "1 ) and the very presence of an inner heii  6560  volume and [ oiii ]  5007  shell would prevent the direct interaction of such a wind with the outer helical structure .",
    "the progression outwards of the expansion velocities i.e. @xmath3  12  for the heii  6560  emitting centre , 13  for the surrounding inner [ oiii ]  5007  shell and 25  for the [ nii ]  6584  emitting outer envelope albeit inside an outer bi  polar configuration ( fig .",
    "11 ) , could be a consequence of the sudden pressure decline that would occur as the fast wind switched off leading to acceleration inwards of the now unsupported inner regions of the previous pressure driven shell ( private comms . by steffen and dyson ) .",
    "incidentally , wilson ( 1950 ) had noticed this increasing velocity from the high  ionisation centres to low  ionisation envelopes of many similarly evolved pne .",
    "however , the clumpy nature of most of the circumstellar material also poses a direct problem for the iw model ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) .      the radial ` spokes ' that are prominent in the bright helical nebulosity and shown here to extend , faintly , to within 30   of the central star are most likely a consequence of the clumpy nature of the nebula .",
    "such a clumpy structure is to be expected when the whole of ngc 7293 is considered for it is famous for its cometary globules beyond a radus of 90  from the central star .",
    "these were first shown to have dense molecular cores directly by huggins et al ( 1992 ) and by meaburn et al ( 1992 ) when sillouetted against the central [ oiii ]  5007  emission .",
    "dyson et al ( 1989 ) had suggested that the cometary globules were a consequence of the ejection of the rg maser spots as dense globules later overrun by the faster agb wind .",
    "if this clumpiness extends to the nebular core it would suggest that clump ejection had occurred with a wide spread of ejection velocities .",
    "the system of well - known cometary globules is expanding radially within the central torus at 14  consistent with their rg origin ( meaburn et al 1998 ) .",
    "the headless radial ` spokes ' could then all be relics of cometary tails from globules that have nearly photoevaporated .",
    "the inner ` spokes ' in fig .",
    "10 could be elongated enhancements of [ nii ]  6584  emission either in the torus containing the cometary globules , extending inwards , or in the walls of the lobes in the model in fig .",
    "11 but pointing always towards the central star . in the latter case",
    "they are then seen in projection over the inner [ oiii ]  5007  and heii  6560  emitting core of the nebula .",
    "the recombination time t of hydrogen is @xmath2  10@xmath17 n@xmath18@xmath10 yr then for a tail electron density n@xmath18 = 50 @xmath19 , t @xmath2 5000 yr .",
    "a longer recombination time in the lower density ionised material of a tail , after the dense head of a cometary globule has evaporated , could on its own then explain the tail s persistence .",
    "a more detailed explanation could be given by lpez - martin et al ( 2001 ) who have discussed the evaporation of the cometary globules and their tails ( see also cant et al 1998 ) .",
    "the clump heads are exposed to the direct ionising radiation of the central star while the tails are only exposed to the diffuse radiation field .",
    "this is typically a few percent of the direct field at the location of the bright optical knots but is very much less closer to the star because of the @xmath20 rise in the direct flux ( lpez - martin et al 2001 ) . for clumps that are close to the central star",
    ", recombinations in the evaporating head gas can not significantly absorb the stellar flux . in this case , the evaporation timescale is approximately ( lpez - martin et al 2001 ) @xmath21 where c@xmath22 and c@xmath23 are the sound speeds in the ionised and neutral gas respectively .",
    "note especially the dependency in eq . 1 on clump radius r@xmath24 : once a clump begins to shrink the evaporation timescale drops and the clump will then rapidly disappear .",
    "the tail will only begin to be exposed to the direct stellar radiation field when the clump shrinks appreciably .",
    "it is thus entirely plausible that the tail may survive the destruction of its parent clump .",
    "it will then be quickly ionised by the direct field and be very overpressured but as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "10 the clumpless tails have not yet had time to mix with the surrounding gas ( for a tail of radius @xmath25 cm the dynamical timescale is a few thousand years in the ionized gas ) .",
    "this predominance of clumps in the ionised envelope of ngc 7293 also makes it most likely that momentum  conserving , mass  loaded ( ablated ) flows ( dyson , hartquist & biro 1993 ) have played an important , even dominant , part in the evolution of this pn . a hybrid explanation , with the iw model applicable immediately after the onset of the fast wind followed by a domination of ablated flows up to the switch  off of the fast wind , may be a more appropriate way of considering the creation of ngc 7293.the velocity structure of the clumpy pne such as ngc 7293 has been recently studied by steffen & lpez ( 2004 ) where progressive expansion velocities with distance from the central star are obtained in the simulations .      the extended ionised material beyond the bright inner regions ( fig .",
    "1 ) was detected by speck et al ( 2002 ) using southern h  alpha sky survey atlas data ( shassa  gaustad et al 2001 ) .",
    "meanwhile , odell et al ( 2002 ) carried out detailed photoionisation modelling of the bulk of the inner shell using cloudy .",
    "the modelling indicated that the nebula was ionisation bounded rather than density bounded yet the presence of the extended ionised gas is confirmed here and in odell et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "the apparent contradiction between the cloudy results of odell et al ( 2002 ) may be explained in the following qualitative way .",
    "the very clumpy nature of the inner ring of ngc 7293 ( the majority of the mass of the shell may even reside as molecules in the clumps speck et al 2002 ) means that it is possible , as long as the volume filling factor of the clumps is not too great , for the ionising radiation to escape the inner ring .",
    "the photoionisation modelling will yield results consistent with an ionisation bounded system simply because the bulk of the emission comes from the clump surfaces where the ionisation is locally bounded .",
    "alternatively , odell et al ( 2004 ) maintain that the central torus ( bc in fig .",
    "11 ) is globally ionisation bounded and that the extended ionised gas lies above and below the plane of this torous .",
    "they also suggest that the extended ionised gas could have been ionised at an earlier epoch and owing to a low density has not yet recombined .",
    "the possibility that expanding lobes or even a disc of material ( sect .",
    "3.3 ) exists in the halo of ngc 7293 is not unexpected when other pne are considered .",
    "multiple axes of ejection are observed in the pne ngc 6302 ( meaburn & walsh 1980 ) , kjpn8 ( lpez et al 2000 ) , ngc 2440 ( lpez et al 1998 ) and j 320 ( harman et al 2004 ) for example . a similar high  speed disc is observed around the bi - polar lobes of mz  3 by santander  garca et al ( 2004 ) . these phenomena are most likely evidence of the volatility , and as yet not understood behaviour , of the agb phase in the evolution of the central stars of pne .    the possibility reported here of a jet and counter bow  shaped feature in the halo of ngc 7293 is again not unexpected when the whole range of observed phenomena are considered in pne .",
    "collimated outflows are seen in many pne e.g. fg 1 ( lpez , roth and tapia 1993 , lpez , meaburn & palmer 1993 ) etc .",
    "there is at yet no consensus about their origin though they must be associated with the onset of the superwind as the stars enter their post  agb phase with binarity of the central stellar systems playing some part in their generation .",
    "progressively increasing expansion velocities are observed from the highly ionised core of ngc 7293 to the lobes that constitute the lowly ionised helical structure .    numerical simulations of the latter structure as",
    "bi  polar lobes , expanding perpendicularly to a central torus , give a reasonable match to the observed images and pv arrays of line profiles .",
    "the standard interacting winds model for the creation of pne explains this kinematical and morphological structure only if the fast wind has switched off as the central star becomes a wd .",
    "ablated flows must add a further complication to any dynamical considerations .",
    "radial ` spokes ' of [ nii ]  emission which are now traced to near the central star could be the remnants of the cometary tails of dense globules that have now photo - evaporated .",
    "it is proposed that a prominant halo arc could be part of a single expanding disk along a different axis to that of the bright nebula although expanding bi  polar lobes along this same axis remain an interpretation .",
    "more extensive kinematical observations are needed to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "a jet - like feature and its counter bow - shock are tentatively identified .",
    "multiple events in the agb phase , and shortly afterwards , of the central star must have created these phenomena .",
    "the authors wish to thank the staff of the aat ( australia ) , spm telescope ( mexico ) , ntt ( la silla , chile ) , and skinakas telescope ( greece ) for their help during these observations .",
    "skinakas observatory is a collaborative project of the university of crete , the foundation for research and technology - hellas and the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik.jal is grateful to the royal society for financing his july 2004 stay in manchester and gratefully acknowledges financial support from conacyt ( mx ) grants 32214-e and 37214 and dgapa - unam in114199 .",
