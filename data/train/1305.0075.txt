    "<S> we note that since the kinetic energy ( [ eq : h0 ] ) possesses su(4 ) rotational symmetry in the channel space @xmath5 , the orbital - singlet class ( iii ) model can be transformed to class ( i ) model without conversion processes @xmath21 by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) of the coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> such transformation is , however , not possible in the orbital doublet case , since this would require diagonalizing 3 matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , at the same time . </S>",

    "<S> this implies , in particular , that the claims  @xcite of the 4-channel symmetric kondo effect in the @xmath39 case are unjustified : group theoretically , this would require the presence of a 4d ir , which is absent in the @xmath40 group ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the latter case , the channel space @xmath41 still breaks up into two 1d and one 2d irs and still the class ( ii ) kondo model is realized . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the increase in symmetry @xmath42 upon placing the ia halfway between the blg sheets does lead to a qualitative change : the channel space @xmath43 breaks up into two _ different _ irs instead of two irs of the _ same type _ ; as a result , conversion processes vanish and the kondo model is transformed from class ( iii ) to ( i ) .    to summarize this part , </S>",
    "<S> our group - theoretical analysis allow us to make definitive symmetry - based model - independent conclusions about the structure of the kondo model , without relying on any specific microscopic details . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it tells exactly if and how different conduction channels are coupled by the exchange interaction , tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that generally the channel states @xmath44 can be either pure valley states or mixtures thereof , as seen from tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis also resolves the concern  @xcite that `` valley mixing '' by the impurity potential could be detrimental for the multichannel kondo effect : while valleys can indeed be mixed , the local symmetry dictates that properly hybridized valley states act as independent channels in several instances ( tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:2 ] ) , and are also completely equivalent if they belong to one 2d ir .    </S>",
    "<S> _ feasibility of the channel - symmetric two - channel kondo effect . </S>",
    "<S> _ we now discuss the implications of our results for the realization of the multichannel kondo effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is well established  @xcite that the low - energy behavior of the multi - channel kondo model is determined by the channel(s ) with the largest exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , effectively , the regime of the multi - channel kondo effect can be realized only if the common coupling of several channels ( belonging to the same multi - dimensional ir ) exceeds all single - channel couplings . </S>",
    "<S> this condition proved to be extremely hard to achieve in practice : in a `` typical '' band structure with no special properties , some single - channel coupling will usually prevail .    </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that , owing to the peculiarities of graphene band structure , the regime of the dominant two - channel kondo effect is feasible in mlg and blg in several cases .    the class ( i ) kondo model , which includes the cases @xmath45 in mlg and @xmath46 in blg , consists of two decoupled symmetric two - channel contributions with their own couplings . </S>",
    "<S> whichever couplings are greater , the low - energy behavior will be dominated by the two channels of that 2d ir .    in the blg @xmath47 case , if the ia is placed above the center of the carbon hexagon of one layer , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] , the atomic orbitals of the 2d ir @xmath19 channels , located on the @xmath48 sublattice in that nearby layer , are much close to the impurity than those of the 1d ir @xmath49 channels , located on @xmath50 sublattice in the remote layer . </S>",
    "<S> thus the hybridization with the @xmath19 channels is likely to be considerably greater than with @xmath49 channels . </S>",
    "<S> this should result in a greater exchange couplings @xmath51 and the low - energy behavior will be dominated by the two @xmath19 channels .    in these cases , in the low - energy regime , the symmetric two - channel kondo models ( [ eq : hj1low ] ) and ( [ eq : hj2low ] ) will be realized in the orbital singlet and doublet cases , respectively , in the subspace of the two dominant channels @xmath27 .    _ conclusion and outlook . _ in summary , motivated by the prospect of realizing multichannel kondo effects , we performed a general group - theoretical classification of the kondo models in mlg and blg in the vicinity of the cnp for all placements of the ia with either 3- or 6-fold rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we found six possible classes of the four - channel kondo models , summarized in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we argued several possibilities for realizing the channel - symmetric two - channel kondo effect , described by the models ( [ eq : hj1low ] ) and ( [ eq : hj2low ] ) , which are known to exhibit non - fermi - liquid behavior in a number of regimes but have proven challenging to realize in practice . </S>",
    "<S> our findings thus open prospects for the observation of the multichannel kondo physics in mlg and blg , which could be pursued experimentally using the local probes , such as scanning tunneling microscopy , or transport measurements .    _ acknowledgement . </S>",
