    "studies of the host galaxies and local environments of supernova ( sn ) explosions have been integral in our understanding of the progenitors of these explosions .",
    "initially host galaxy studies found the almost exclusive presence of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , implying young stellar progenitors .",
    "the more central locations of type ibc sne compared to type ii sne also led to the suggestion that these events arise from higher metallicity environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these examples demonstrate the power of using host galaxy analysis , and studying the local environments of sne , in constraining the progenitors of these explosions .",
    "these type of analyses will be utilised throughout this paper to concentrate on a sample of transients generally accepted to be interacting with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) , namely type iin supernovae ( sniin ) and sn impostors .",
    "the progenitor systems of these ` interacting transients ' , and the cause of the dense csm , may arise through a variety of routes . in this introduction",
    "we will discuss both types of transients in this sample , sniin and impostors , the features which appear common to both groups , and the possible subgroups within the classes .",
    "the iin class is rare within the ccsn group ( @xmath27  per cent according to @xcite ) , and the nature of the explosions remains very uncertain , with the class being characterised principally by narrow lines in the spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the class was originally defined by @xcite , though he also stressed that a fundamental progenitor characteristic was required for the objects to be a truly distinct class , something which remains elusive .",
    "this initial paper not only characterised the objects as having narrow spectral features , but also having a blue continuum and slow evolution ( at least spectroscopically ) , characteristics of the group which remain prominent @xcite .",
    "the source of the narrow emission lines is generally accepted to be the result of interaction between the supernova ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium immediately surrounding the explosion .",
    "this interaction creates hard emission which photo - ionises the surrounding unshocked material , resulting in an h@xmath0 excess ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as sniin have been explored in more detail , the narrow spectral lines have been found to have multiple components ; a ` narrow ' line ( typically a few hundred kms@xmath3 ) caused by the photoionisation of the unshocked wind surrounding the progenitor , and an ` intermediate - width ' line ( a few thousand kms@xmath3 ) from dense post - shock gas ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these compare to typical broad lines in sn ejecta with widths of 10,000 - 20,000 kms@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the only robust direct detection of a sniin progenitor was made for sn2005gl @xcite .",
    "the detection of a star at its location , and the subsequent disappearance , indicated that the progenitor was a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star with a mass likely to be in excess of 50 m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the calculated mass loss rates and wind speeds of well - studied sniin seem to reflect this progenitor channel with only lbv stars predicted to be able to reach high enough mass loss rates , yet with smaller wind speeds in general than wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of information available about the variability of the star pre - explosion does lead to some debate as to whether the pre - explosion observations of sn2005gl , which give rise to the high mass estimates of the progenitor , were taken during a quiescent period .",
    "little is known about the long term variability of lbvs , though recent work by @xcite has studied type iin sne detected by the palomar transient survey @xcite and found that half of iin show at least one outburst up to @xmath2120 days prior to explosion , with multiple outbursts common over the preceding year .",
    "an example of this is the type iin sn2010mc which experienced a huge mass loss event 40 days prior to explosion @xcite .",
    "studies have also shown lbvs to have major outbursts on timescales of years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which suggest that there is a chance that the progenitor of sn2005gl was serendipitously in outburst on the single pre - explosion image .",
    "should the lbv have been in outburst when the one pre - explosion image was taken , it is possible that the quiescent star had an actual intrinsic brightness 3 magnitudes lower @xcite and consequently the mass would lie in the range of 20 - 25 m@xmath4 according to the models of @xcite .",
    "there is more controversy over the assumption of lbv progenitors for sne , not least because stellar evolution models have until recently been unable to end a star s lifetime in the lbv phase ( e.g. @xcite , though see @xcite for some possible scenarios ) .",
    "stellar evolution models instead require the lbv star to lose the hydrogen envelope before becoming a wr star and then exploding @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found from their rotational stellar evolution models coupled with atmospheric models , that stars in the mass range 20 - 25 m@xmath4 exploded in the lbv phase .",
    "although no post - explosion spectra were computed , @xcite speculated from the surface abundance measurements pre - explosion and position of the star on the hr diagram , that explosions of stars of 20 m@xmath4 are likely to be classified as type iib rather than iin sne .",
    "however , the increased mass loss of the 25 m@xmath4 stars is likely to produce a h - rich , dense csm , and the interaction of the sn with this csm could produce a type iin sn .    aside from the case of sn2005gl , @xcite argues that the assumptions of lbv progenitors may be flawed .",
    "the mass loss equations assume wind mass - loss rates and velocities to be constant with time @xcite .",
    "an lbv phase , with numerous eruptions prior to explosion ( required in order to have the dense medium for the ejecta to interact with ) , does not have a constant wind mass - loss rate .",
    "the one certainty regarding the progenitors is the need for a dense csm ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the assumption has traditionally been that this must be due to lbv - type eruptions , but @xcite argue that it is possible that the dense csm was produced over a longer timescale prior to the eventual eruption of the progenitor star , meaning an lbv could have progressed into its wr phase before explosion . alternatively a clumpy csm could produce a similar result , where interaction with a dense clump could cause narrow lines in the spectrum , but not represent an overall high - density csm ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the general consensus in the literature , however , appears to be that the most likely candidate progenitors of sniin are lbv stars , though there are likely to be several different progenitor types even within this small but diverse class .",
    "the sniin class has therefore proved mysterious . aside from the defining narrow emission lines ,",
    "the objects within the class show diverse features , particularly light curves ( lcs ) , and over time it has been discovered that many of the objects are not true ccsne at all and have hence been reclassified .      a rare ( @xmath51 per cent of all ccsne ;",
    "@xcite ) subclass of transients have been termed type ibn @xcite ; these appear to be type ib / c",
    "cc - explosions embedded within a he - rich envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "sn2006jc is often referred to as the prototype for this group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but several others have been observed ( e.g. sn1999cq , @xcite ; sn2000er , @xcite ; sn2002ao , @xcite ) .",
    "these events have been suggested to be a distinct class of ccsne @xcite , but more recent analysis has suggested that they are more likely snib / c explosions occurring in a high density csm , formed either by pre - explosion mass loss of a very massive ( @xmath5100m@xmath4 ) single star , or an lbv and wr binary system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have distinctive spectroscopic characteristics showing strong signs of csm interaction in the form of narrow lines , but these tend to be dominated by he rather than h ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recent events found to exhibit these characteristics ( e.g. sn2011hw , @xcite ) indicate that the class may be a span a large range , with some events showing more h emission , which could occur if the progenitors exploded at different points along the transition from an lbv to a wr @xcite .",
    "the recent work of @xcite obtained the earliest ever observations of a type ibn sn , iptf13beo , whose light curve showed a double peak structure . @xcite",
    "interpret this as a massive star exploding in a dense csm with the initial peak powered by sn shock breakout in the csm , followed by the second peak representing the sn radioactive decay .",
    "however , this massive star origin has been complicated by recent observations of the type ibn sn pan - starrs1 - 12sk which was found in an elliptical brightest cluster galaxy containing no star formation @xcite , suggesting that some of these events may have older stellar progenitors .",
    "a group within the iin class has been identified as thermonuclear explosions within a dense hydrogen - rich environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a hybrid of the snia thermonuclear class , yet showing sniin features ( notably the presence of hydrogen ) , often referred to in the literature as ia - csm ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the wd within the system explodes as an snia when it reaches the carbon ignition point and then interacts with a dense csm producing type iin - like emission lines ( e.g. sn2002ic ; @xcite , although see @xcite for a possible massive star origin for these systems ) .",
    "the origin of this dense csm is still unclear as is the percentage of the currently classified sniin which may actually belong to this group .",
    "@xcite studied sniin detected by the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; @xcite ) and found that @xmath210 per cent of explosions classified as sniin were more likely to be thermonuclear supernovae , interacting with a dense csm .",
    "they also find the snia - csm in their sample to have a range of magnitudes in the _ r_-band of 21.3 to 19 , i.e. brighter than most ccsn events .",
    "several sniin events have been reclassified as snia - csm due to their similarity to previous explosions , most notably sn1997cy @xcite . however ,",
    "this has been questioned by @xcite who intensively followed one of these events , sn2012ca , and found its nebular spectrum to be consistent with a core - collapse explosion .",
    "some explosions showing narrow emission lines , originally classified as sniin , have later been re - classed as sn ` impostors ' when it has become clear that the progenitor stars have survived ( e.g. sn1954j , @xcite ; sn2009ip , @xcite ) .",
    "sn impostors are thought to originate from the eruption of an lbv star , such as @xmath1 carina , however , the eruption is non - terminal and hence not a true sn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "usually these events are much fainter than true sn explosions and so are distinct from the sniin group , however , the range in photometric properties of both the sniin and impostor classes are so diverse that this may not always be the case ( see @xcite for the wide range of absolute magnitudes and decline rates of the sniin class ) .      when sn2008s was discovered @xcite it was classified as a sniin due to the narrow balmer emission lines @xcite though some of the spectral features seen and the faint peak magnitude of the explosion led to some speculation that the event was actually a sn impostor @xcite .",
    "given its proximity , it was hoped that the progenitor star might have been directly detectable , but pre - explosion images obtained on the large binocular telescope found nothing ( upper limits m@xmath6@xmath74.8 , m@xmath8@xmath74.3 , m@xmath9@xmath73.8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a point source was detected at the location of sn2008s in archival infrared _ spitzer _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "the detection implied that the progenitor was a dust enshrouded @xmath210  m@xmath4 star , much lower than assumed sniin progenitor masses .",
    "the literature now agrees that this event was a sn impostor rather than a true sn eruption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has come to define a group of sn impostors which have lower masses than generally expected from lbv eruptions @xcite , which are usually accepted to be the progenitors of sn impostors , and are often heavily dust enshrouded @xcite .",
    "sn2009ip was incorrectly classified as a sn during its 2009 outburst ; the progenitor star was known to have had previous s dor - like outbursts ( see @xcite for an account of the star s pre - discovery variability ) , and was detected on pre - explosion images , taken 10 years prior to the 2009 discovery , as a massive lbv star ( 50 - 80 m@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star had another outburst in 2010 @xcite , and in 2012 had an outburst followed by re - brightening @xcite .",
    "it is still debated whether this most recent explosion is the transition into a true ccsn explosion .",
    "@xcite presented photometric and spectroscopic follow up of the event , which showed a snii - like broad p cygni profile in the balmer lines , spectral lines with velocities typical of sn explosions and a peak magnitude of @xmath218 .",
    "however @xcite find no evidence for nucleosynthesised material in late time spectra and the extensive multi - wavelength photometric and spectroscopic follow up of the event presented in @xcite shows the latest explosion to be consistent with another outburst of the lbv progenitor .",
    "@xcite , however , interpret the near infrared excess seen in the 2012 outburst of sn2009ip as the recent outburst propagating through previous episodic lbv outbursts which have deposited a dense csm , and they conclude that the 2012 outburst was a true sn explosion .",
    "the work of @xcite also argues that the latest explosion was a true sn with the ejecta having @xmath1010@xmath11 ergs of kinetic energy , which is hard to reconcile with a progenitor having survived the explosion .",
    "the environment of sn2009ip is very unusual , as the star is located outside the main disk of the galaxy .",
    "the well - studied sniin explosions to date tend to be biased towards high - luminosity or ` unusual ' events @xcite , which also means that any implications drawn from these events on the progenitors of the whole class could be flawed .",
    "recently @xcite presented the results of the follow up of five type iin sne from the carnegie supernova project .",
    "most of these were from targeted surveys and hence from bright , nearby spiral galaxies , with high extinction in only two cases , a highly inclined galaxy , and a sn close to the central regions of its host .",
    "@xcite conclude that from their mass - loss equations , lbvs are still the most likely progenitor of this group .    in this paper",
    ", we conduct a study of the environments of csm - interacting transients , in the form of type iin sne and sn impostors .",
    "these events were selected by their presence in the asiago sn catalogue with an sniin classification , or through a literature search for impostors .",
    "events were not selected according to the amount of interaction observed , or by the types of galaxies in which they are present .",
    "we only require the host galaxies to have recession velocities less than 6000  kms@xmath3 and to have major to minor axis ratios less than 4:1 , in order that our host galaxy analysis techniques are robust ( see @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "we present a new analysis of the radial distribution within their host galaxies of the resulting sample of interacting transients , and updated results for their respective association with h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the total sample of events studied is 26 probable iin and 13 probable impostors , although we can only analyse the detailed environment of 37 of these as explained below .",
    "we also carry out a robust analysis of the selection effects involved in both sniin and impostor studies .    in section 2 we present an analysis of the host galaxies within this sample , along with the positional information of the interacting transients in terms of the _ r_-band and h@xmath0 emission .",
    "section 3 will analyse the association of the transients with star formation , as traced by h@xmath0 emission . in section 4",
    "the selection effects within the samples of sniin and sn impostors are explored .",
    "section 5 discusses the individual events contained within these samples and conclusions are drawn in section 6 .    throughout this paper comparisons",
    "will be made between the sniin and impostor , or interacting transient class , and the sniip and snic classes ( all ccsn subtype samples are presented in @xcite and snia samples in anderson et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "these comparison samples include sne in all star - forming host galaxies ( i.e. not just in undisturbed hosts , see @xcite ) , however , it is emphasised that no events have been selected due to the interacting nature of their hosts , with all host galaxy classifications carried out after the sn analysis .",
    "the sniip and snic sub - types fall at the extremes of the currently understood mass sequence of ccsne progenitors .",
    "the masses of sniip progenitors have been well established through direct detection methods ( see @xcite for a review ) to lie within 8 and 20 m@xmath4 .",
    "although the true mass range for type ic sne is unknown , the class as a whole are thought to result from the explosions of progenitors with much higher zero - age main sequence masses , even if these progenitors are within binary systems , both from their association with star formation ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and through high mass stellar evolution models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sample of interacting transients that will be analysed within this paper are presented in table 1 , including the reference from which the classification of the transient has been taken .",
    "the host galaxies are presented in table 2 , including the hubble type and recession velocity , the distance , absolute magnitude , and inferred global and local ( to the sn ) metallicity . in total",
    "there are 39 events , and for each host galaxy we have _ r_-band and h@xmath0 images , taken over a series of observing runs between 2001 and 2012 .",
    "the details of the data reduction processes used are presented in @xcite for all of the observations taken prior to 2012 .",
    "for the four host galaxies observed in 2012 by the liverpool telescope ( lt ) , initial ccd reduction was done by the automated pipeline and an image subtraction pipeline built around the isis package @xcite was used to obtain continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 images .",
    "the h@xmath0 maps for each of the interacting - transient host galaxies can be seen in figure 1 , with the transients positions marked with red circles .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is clear from this analysis that the locations of interacting transients as a whole are different from the locations of snic , both in terms of their radial positions within the hosts , and in terms of their association with h@xmath0 emission .",
    "taken together with the results of @xcite , this indicates that most of the interacting events do not have high mass progenitors .",
    "the ncr value analysis has produced a clear distinction between the sn2008s - like transients and @xmath1 carina - type impostors , with all sn2008s - like impostors lying on regions of zero star formation as traced by h@xmath0 emission , and @xmath1 carina - like events , thought to arise from lbv eruptions , showing positive ncr values .",
    "this paper has presented the most comprehensive host galaxy environment study of interacting transients ( sniin and sn impostors ) to date . following a discussion of the selection effects involved in this study , which are more likely to affect the sn impostor sample than that of the sniin sample , we draw the following conclusions :    * the host galaxies of interacting transients trace the normal star formation in the local universe , whereas snic appear to have more massive hosts . *",
    "the host galaxies of sn impostors appear slightly less luminous than ccsn - hosts , and correspondingly have lower metallicities . *",
    "inferred local metallicities at the sites of sn impostors are lower than snic , sniip and sniin sites .",
    "sniin appear to have slightly more metal - rich sites than sniip .",

    "the sole event which falls in the central 20 per cent of host galaxy _",
    "r_-band light is known to be an snia - csm event , therefore no massive progenitors of interacting transients are found in the central regions of their host galaxies . * the radial distributions of interacting transients and snic ( with the highest mass progenitors )",
    "are very different ( ks ; p@xmath50.1 per cent ) , with the former tending to lie in the outer regions of their hosts , while the latter are strongly centrally concentrated .",
    "* a pronounced difference between interacting transients and snic is also seen in the association with ongoing star formation . unlike the snic",
    ", the interacting transients do not trace h@xmath0 emission , and therefore ongoing star formation ( ks ; p@xmath50.1 per cent ) . *",
    "all sn impostors designated sn2008s - like within this sample fall on regions with zero h@xmath0 emission , whereas those classed as @xmath1 carina - like fall on positive values , with an average ncr@xmath12 of 0.157 .",
