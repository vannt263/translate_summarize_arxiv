    "determination of distances is important task in astrophysics , especially in extragalactic astrophysics . for the study of structure , kinematics and dynamics of galaxy groups and clusters we must know accurate distances to galaxies .",
    "our object is a scattered cloud of galaxies in canes venatici constellation , cvn i cloud .",
    "the brightest galaxy of the cloud is m94 ( other name of this complex is m94 group ) .",
    "neighboring galaxy groups ( local group , m81 , cen a and others ) are compact dense groups with strong concentration to central massive galaxy . unlike those groups , the cvn i cloud is scattered , sparse grouping in the local volume . in our work",
    "we derived the distances to cvn i cloud galaxies from the luminosity of the tip of the rgb stars .",
    "the cvn i cloud is clearly seen in redshift space .",
    "histogram in figure  1 shows a rather isolated peak at @xmath0  km / s , which caused by galaxies in the cvn i cloud . for our sample",
    "we selected the galaxies with radial velocities less than 400  km / s .",
    "for distance determination we use advanced tip of the red giant branch method @xcite .",
    "this method is based on a maximum likelihood algorithm of locating the trgb position and is optimized by introducing reliable photometric errors and completeness function determined from artificial star experiments .",
    "advanced trgb - method is especially useful in the cases when the trgb approaches the photometric limit or is poorly populated .",
    "the source of images is snapshot programs of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the observed photometry is extracted from hst wfpc2 images with hstphot package or from hst acs images with the dolhpot package @xcite .",
    "obtained color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are analyze with the trgbtool program developed by makarov for realization of advanced trgb - method .",
    "the results of distance determination are summarized in table 1 .",
    "this table contains the following columns : ( 1 ) galaxy name ; ( 2 ) equatorial coordinates of the galaxy center ( j2000 ) ; ( 3 ) radial velocity with respect to the lg centroid ; ( 4 ) distance to galaxy in mpc ; ( 5 ) positive and negative uncertainty of distance in mpc ; ( 6 ) blue absolute magnitude of a galaxy with the given distance in magnitudes ; ( 7 ) morphological type in de vaucouleurs notation .",
    "typical accuracy of the most of our distances is 5 - 6% .",
    "such result places confident cmds with considerable stellar population in the trgb region with trgb situated at more then 1@xmath1 above the photometric limit . for some cmds distance errors may be very large , up to 25% .",
    ".properties of cvn i galaxies . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the total blue luminosity of the core is equal to about @xmath2 .",
    "it gives the mass - to - luminosity ratio for the cvn of 100@xmath3200  @xmath4 .",
    "it is a rather big value , that indicates the presence of significant amount of the dark matter .",
    "the homogeneous distances to the galaxies in the cvn i cloud were determined using improved trgb method .",
    "most of the measurements have 5 - 6% error .",
    "available images of the hubble data archive allow us to measure distances up to @xmath5  mpc .",
    "we need special observations with long exposure on new wfpc3 camera to reach rgb stars for more distant galaxies .",
    "new data allow us to distinguish the core and foreground outskirt of the cvn cloud .",
    "unfortunately , we can not say anything about rear of the cloud because that galaxies lie beyond the limit of the accurate distance determination .",
    "though this cloud does not contain giant galaxies and almost all galaxies are of dwarf irregulars the dynamical mass of the cvn i cloud is nearly the same as masses of groups like local group with massive central galaxies .",
    "most likely the cvn i cloud is semi - virialized group of galaxies formed in the gravitational field of the dark matter with center at distance @xmath6  mpc in the canes venatici constellation .",
