    "in the past decade the interest in the physical properties of correlated electronic systems has greatly increased .",
    "one reason is the strong local correlations on transition metal ions in cuprate superconductors and manganites , and the corresponding unusual properties of these compounds .",
    "the parent undoped compounds are mott - hubbard or charge transfer insulators , while doping leads to correlated metals in which the kinetic energy of charge carriers competes with magnetic order.@xcite one of the most spectacular consequences is the onset of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "it is believed that a satisfactory description of the normal phase properties is a prerequisite for the understanding of the microscopic mechanism of pairing in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the electronic states in cuo@xmath0 planes of cuprate superconductors are usually described in terms of the emery model which includes the hybridization between cu(@xmath1 ) and o(@xmath2 ) states.@xcite however , hole doping leads to the formation of local zhang - rice singlets , @xcite and the essential excitations in the cuprates within a window of a few ev around the chemical potential are well reproduced using the effective two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model with extended hopping @xcite and a large local coulomb interaction @xmath3 , as shown by various numerical studies of the @xmath4-@xmath5 and hubbard model.@xcite    recently it was shown @xcite that the effective hubbard model has to include hopping beyond the nearest - neighbors .",
    "the second nearest - neighbor hopping changes the dispersion of the quasiparticle ( qp ) states , and is therefore crucial for understanding angular resolved photoemission ( arpes ) data of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0.@xcite both second and third neighbor hopping parameters follow from the down - folding procedure in electronic structure calculations,@xcite and influence the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "they have a particular relation to the value of the superconducting transition temperature at optimal doping.@xcite    the superconductivity occurs in the cuprates under doping @xmath6 of a half - filled ( @xmath7 ) af insulator , and is accompanied by a gradual modification of the magnetic order .",
    "the nature of magnetic correlations in doped materials is therefore a central issue in the theory of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "undoped la@xmath0cuo@xmath8 is a _ commensurate _",
    "af insulator , while doping by sr into la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath8 results in short - range af order within _ incommensurate _",
    "magnetic structures.@xcite such an incommensurate magnetic order was indeed found analytically,@xcite in hartree - fock ( hf),@xcite and in a slave - boson approximation.@xcite however , in order to understand the transport properties one has to go beyond an effective single - particle description and include the dynamics due to local electron correlations .",
    "a sufficiently accurate treatment of local electron correlations remains one of the challenging problems in modern solid state theory .",
    "although an important progress in the present understanding of strongly correlated fermion systems occurred recently due to numerical methods , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) , an analytic treatment that maintains local correlations is needed to investigate the consequences of strong correlations in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an attractive possibility is the limit of large spatial dimension ( @xmath11 ) , where the diagrams in the perturbative expansion collapse to a single site and the fermion dynamics is described by a _",
    "local self - energy_.@xcite this allows a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models , which can then be solved self - consistently using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite    the dmft was quite successful for the hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath4 at half - filling , where it predicts the mott transition to the insulating state ( @xmath7).@xcite this was also found by logan , eastwood , and tusch @xcite for the @xmath11 case using an analytic method .",
    "attempts to use dmft at arbitrary filling , however , made it clear that the local self - energy becomes particularly important in systems with magnetic long - range order ( lro ) , which are easily destabilized when the correlation effects are overestimated .",
    "the self - energy therefore plays a decisive role and has to be described _ beyond _ second order perturbation theory ( sopt).@xcite this has made the application of dmft to magnetically ordered systems notoriously difficult .",
    "recently we have shown that the screening of local coulomb interaction by the particle - particle diagrams plays a crucial role in stabilizing the incommensurate magnetic lro in doped systems.@xcite    the advantage of using dmft becomes clear by looking at the single hole problem , which can be solved exactly in the @xmath12 limit.@xcite the method becomes exact because the quantum fluctuations are of higher order in the @xmath13-expansion than the leading potential term which originates from the ising part of the superexchange interaction @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , applying dmft to the @xmath15 case might still capture the essential features that result from the coupling of a moving hole to local spin fluctuations .",
    "we will show below that in fact such quantities as the spectral function , the qp band , and the size of the qp spectral weight are well reproduced within the dmft , which for a single hole includes only those processes which are present in the @xmath16 model .",
    "although this approach becomes exact only in the @xmath12 limit,@xcite it gives a sufficient accuracy of the one - particle spectral function even in finite dimension @xmath15.@xcite the dmft allows us to calculate the optical conductivity in the @xmath11 limit of metzner and vollhardt @xcite from the knowledge of the local self - energy without further approximations.@xcite the studies performed in this limit for the nonmagnetic systems already allowed a qualitative reproduction of such experimental observations in the cuprates as the increase of the drude peak with doping , and a temperature and doping dependent mid - infrared peak.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the self - consistent procedure to determine a local self - energy within the dmft is introduced in sec .",
    "it consists of the hf potential and the dynamical part due to spin fluctuations which uses a coulomb interaction renormalized by particle - particle scattering .",

    "the hopping elements @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the nearest neighbor , second - nearest neighbor , and third - neighbor hopping on a 2d square lattice , and serve to model the electronic states of the charge - transfer type in the cuprates . for convenience",
    "we choose @xmath4 as the energy unit .",
    "it is interesting to note that hopping beyond nearest - neighbors contributes to the energy and other properties not only in a 2d model , but also in the limit of @xmath12 .",
    "the energy contributions due to more distant neighbors are finite due to the scaling of the hopping parameters on a hypercubic lattice .",

    "we introduce an ansatz for the modified magnetic order in the doped systems , and assume incommensurate ss structures with a large but finite periodicity .",

    "we already pointed out earlier @xcite that the spectral weight transferred into the lhb in the one - particle spectra agrees with the predictions of perturbation theory in the strongly correlated regime.@xcite in the optical spectra for the hubbard model at @xmath207 one finds that the weight transferred into the region below the mott - hubbard gap is increased by a factor @xmath393 with respect to @xmath241 when the system is doped to @xmath242 .",
    "this change is significant as the total weight obtained from ( [ sumo ] ) via @xmath374 remained roughly constant [ see fig . [",

    "[ fig : drude](b ) ] , which increased in the same doping range by a factor @xmath394 although the hole density increased only by a factor @xmath395 .",
    "these changes in the coherent optical weight are consistent with the observation made in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] that the single - particle excitation spectra become _ more coherent _ as the hole density increases .",
    "we reported a generalization of the dmft to the magnetically ordered states and showed that this method allows for a very transparent study of spectral properties of the hubbard model at and close to half - filling .",
    "the crucial step is the derived formula for the self - energy using the berk - schrieffer @xcite spin - fluctuation exchange interaction with an effective potential due to particle - particle scattering.@xcite we have demonstrated that this treatment of the many - body effects reproduces the leading dependence on doping and temperature and gives a very favorable comparison with the available numerical data obtained in the qmc and ed calculations for a 2d hubbard model .",
    "although the @xmath71-dependence of the self - energy was not included , the spectral functions for a single hole in a mott - hubbard insulator agrees well with the known structure for the @xmath4-@xmath5 model,@xcite and gives the pes spectrum consisting of a _ coherent _ qp peak with a dispersion @xmath229 , and an _ incoherent _ part of width @xmath276 at lower energies .",
    "we have verified that the qp weight agrees well with the ed data in the range of @xmath396,@xcite and supports the string picture.@xcite furthermore , the calculation reveals a nontrivial relation between the electron occupation factors , @xmath140 , and the qp weights , @xmath397 , and shows that the maximum of @xmath397 is shifted away from the @xmath398 point , in agreement with the ed results of eskes and eder.@xcite    our study has shown that doping of a mott - hubbard insulator leads to an incommensurate magnetic order at low temperatures , which depends on the actual values of the hopping parameters and the coulomb interaction @xmath3 .",
    "this kind of magnetic order induces a _ pseudogap in the one - particle spectra _ which is one of the generic features of the doped mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "the dependence of the pseudogap on the incommensurate magnetic order explains why it could not be observed in ed data on small clusters at finite temperature,@xcite or in the infinite - dimensional hubbard model in the paramagnetic state.@xcite this new energy scale due to a _ pseudogap of magnetic origin _ demonstrates a combination of physics arising from the slater picture and the mott - hubbard description of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the coherent qp states survive in the doped systems , in agreement with the qmc and ed results . however , the numerical studies suggest that a strong @xmath71-dependence of self - energy might be necessary to describe the spectra , as the qp dispersions change .",
    "this failure of the rigid qp band picture finds here quite a different explanation : _ the changes of the qp dispersion follow from the incommensurate magnetic order _ which develops with doping , and the leading effects in the hole dynamics are still _ captured by a local self - energy_.    the one - particle and optical spectra are interrelated , and the opening of a pseudogap at low temperatures leads to a mid - gap state next to the drude peak in the optical conductivity , both with growing intensity under increasing doping .",
    "such features , observed in the ss states at low temperatures , as the suppressed scattering rate and large effective mass in the underdoped regime , and almost no enhancement of the effective mass in a broad energy range in overdoped systems are in remarkably good _ qualitative _ agreement with the experimental findings in the cuprates.@xcite this is consistent with the reduced density of states @xmath399 at the fermi energy at low temperature . with increasing temperature the value of @xmath399 increases , which could not be explained in paramagnetic calculations performed within the dmft approach .",
    "it should be realized that such a strong temperature dependence of @xmath399 should have important consequences for several measurable quantities in the normal phase , as for example knight shift .",
    "here we limited ourselves to the qualitative consequences of the extended hopping @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the one - particle and optical spectra .",
    "first of all , the qp dispersion is strongly influenced by these parameters , and at half filling reproduces the experimental width and dispersion of the qp band in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0.@xcite second , the deviation of the characteristic @xmath41-vector from the af vector @xmath400 increases as a function of doping in ss states , and this process is accelerated by a finite value of second- ( @xmath401)and third - neighbor ( @xmath402 ) hopping .",
    "this explains why the systems with extended hopping are more metallic which is indicated by the low effective mass and larger drude weight .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic order on temperature has also rather drastic consequences for the measurable quantities .",
    "the onset of magnetic order below a characteristic temperature results in quite different one - particle and optical spectra at low temperatures from those obtained in a paramagnetic phase .",
    "the changes of the spiral @xmath41-vector with decreasing temperature allow to introduce a crossover temperature @xmath301 , below which the low - lying excitations are gradually modified along with the changes in local magnetic order .",
    "such a modification gives a quasi - linear resistivity , and verifies the conjecture of shraiman and siggia.@xcite    in spite of very good agreement for the undoped systems , however , we identified several important features which do not agree with the experiments in the doped cuprates even on a qualitative level , that might indicate that either a more accurate treatment of the many - body problem is necessary , or more complex magnetic structures are stabilized in these compounds : ( i ) the value of the pseudogap in the one - particle spectra and the accompanying energy scale for the suppressed scattering rate in the optical conductivity are overestimated by a factor close to five with respect to the experimental observations .",
    "( ii ) the ss(1,1 ) state obtained for the la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath8 model parameters leads to a different splitting of the magnetic scattering peak in neutron experiments than the experimentally observed ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) splittings.@xcite ( iii ) the incommensurate order deviates too fast from the af state for the model parameters of yba@xmath0cu@xmath234o@xmath235 which results in different spin - spin correlations than those observed in experiment , and a qp peak at the @xmath224-point moving to too low energies.@xcite ( iv ) the doping behavior of the pseudogap and of the related crossover temperature @xmath301 is opposite to the one observed in the cuprates . in these materials",
    "the pseudogap and @xmath301 decrease upon doping , whereas here the corresponding quantities increase from the @xmath241 to the @xmath242 case . with increasing doping charge fluctuations",
    "become more and more important which gives rise to the suppression of magnetic order , and consequently the pseudogap closes .",
    "however , such correlations are _ underestimated _ in the present treatment , and one finds instead a persisting pseudogap .",
    "( v ) finally , the spiral spin ordering in the ( 1,1 ) direction contrasts with experimental evidences from neutron scattering in the cuprates , suggesting that stripe ordering might play a prominent role in these systems at very low temperatures.@xcite we have found a phase separation at low doping levels and therefore the presently studied dilute hole gas in ss states is unstable towards magnetic polarons or stripe phases at doping levels lower than @xmath403 .",
    "this motivates a further search for more complex magnetic ground states with incommensurate order , and more accurate methods to describe them in theory .",
    "summarizing , we presented a successful formulation of the dmft for strongly correlated magnetic systems , which opens a possibility of further applications in transition metal oxides .",
    "in contrast to the earlier formulations based on the modified second - order formula for the self - energy,@xcite the present self - energy which describes the dynamical effects in the propagation of a hole coupled to spin fluctuations allows to obtain stable magnetic solutions : af ordering at half - filling and ss in doped systems .",
    "although it is likely that better variational states , possibly with stripe ordering,@xcite could be found it is expected that the presented spectral and optical properties are generic for strongly - correlated systems with incommensurate order parameter . a better understanding of the cuprates , however , requires a further development of theory which should be able to capture the gradual changes of local magnetic correlations in doped mott - hubbard systems under increasing temperature .",
