    "at present a very interesting topic in the field of medium energy physics is devoted to the role of effective degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) in hadronic systems in terms of nucleon , meson and isobar d.o.f .  and their connection to the underlying quark - gluon dynamics of qcd .",
    "for the study of this basic question , the two - nucleon system provides an important test laboratory , because it is obviously the simplest nuclear system for the study of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in @xmath1 scattering including deuteron properties , and , furthermore , for testing this effective description in other reactions on the deuteron , for example , in elastic and inelastic electron scattering , in photodisintegration , and meson photo- and electroproduction .",
    "moreover , due to the lack of free neutron targets , reactions on the deuteron are also an important tool to test our present understanding of neutron properties . as an example for the latter aspect",
    ", we would like to mention the recently much discussed determination of the electric form factor @xmath4 of the neutron in @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite , or the investigation of the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule for the deuteron @xcite .",
    "however , in order to separate the unwanted binding effects from the neutron properties , a precise knowledge of the structure dependent effects is needed .",
    "intense efforts over many past decades in experiment and theory have shown that for energies below pion threshold a satisfactory description of @xmath1 scattering and deuteron properties @xcite , as well as photo- and electrodisintegration of the deuteron is achieved within the conventional framework of nucleon , meson and isobar d.o.f .",
    "@xcite , although the description of observables is not perfect because for certain observables significant discrepancies remain unresolved as , for example , in elastic electron deuteron scattering @xcite . at higher energies , above pion threshold",
    "our theoretical understanding of the various experimental data is much less well settled . even for deuteron photodisintegration ( for a detailed review",
    "see @xcite ) , none of the various theoretical approaches like the diagrammatic method of laget @xcite , the framework of nuclear isobar configurations in the impulse approximation @xcite , the unitary three - body model @xcite or the coupled channel approach ( cc ) @xcite is able to describe in a satisfactory manner the whole set of experimental data on differential cross sections and polarization observables for energies covering the whole @xmath0 resonance region .",
    "a common feature of most of these approaches is the extensive use of the static limit for the meson propagator which enters the hadronic interaction and the electromagnetic two - body exchange current operators , although there is little justification for that in view of the relatively high excitation energies involved . also from the point of view of special relativity",
    ", a non - instantaneous interaction would be required .",
    "the reason , why this static approximation is still used , is the enormous simplification of the operator structure becoming local , and thus is much simpler to evaluate numerically .",
    "it has already been conjectured in @xcite , that one main reason for the above mentioned failure of the theoretical description lies in the neglect of meson retardation in the meson exchange operators . indeed , first results @xcite based on the thesis of m.  schwamb  @xcite have shown that a much better description of deuteron photodisintegration compared to the static approaches is obtained if meson retardation is retained .    in this paper , we want to present a realistic , but still tractable model for a retarded hadronic interaction within a nonrelativistic framework which is suitable to be used as input in electromagnetic reactions on the deuteron like , for example , photo- and electrodisintegration or pion production .",
    "there exists already a variety of models for treating retardation in @xmath1 scattering based on three - body theory , for example , the work of kloet and silbar  @xcite and tanabe and ohta  @xcite . in these calculations , however , the driving force is basically one - pion - exchange so that the lower partial waves in @xmath1 scattering can not be described reasonably well , even at energies below pion threshold .",
    "the neglected short - range interaction is , however , of crucial importance for electromagnetic and hadronic breakup reactions on the deuteron .",
    "tanabe and ohta , for example , have `` patched up '' this problem in photodisintegration of the deuteron  @xcite by mixing retarded and static frameworks , namely the static paris potential for the final state interaction with respect to the nucleon one - body current and the @xmath3 mec , whereas for the @xmath0 contributions they employ a three - body model in which heavy meson exchange has been neglected .",
    "kloet and silbar on the other hand have taken a retarded pion exchange and static heavy meson exchange in an improved model of @xmath1 scattering  @xcite .",
    "also other treatments of retardation in the @xmath1-interaction like , e.g.   refs .",
    "@xcite have some drawbacks as will be discussed later .",
    "the shortcomings of these approaches have been overcome to a large extent in the present model which ensures , due to the use of the elster - potential  @xcite as an input , a reasonable description of all relevant partial waves below and above pion threshold within a consistent framework in time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "thus we will present here the basic framework of a model for the hadronic interaction in which retardation in the exchange operators is fully included .",
    "we would like to emphasize the fact that this formalism can be applied to any reaction on the two - nucleon system for excitation energies up to about 500 mev in which not more than one pion is produced or absorbed .",
    "but in this paper we will restrict ourselves to the hadronic interaction in studying @xmath1 scattering and deuteron properties only in order to fix all free hadronic parameters of our model .",
    "the application of this formalism to other hadronic reactions like @xmath7 scattering as well as to electromagnetic reactions will be deferred to forthcoming papers .",
    "the conceptual basis and the main features of our model are laid out in sect .",
    "[ kap_hadonische_ww ] . in view of the fact that conventional retarded interactions in pure nucleonic space are energy dependent and thus non - hermitean ,",
    "we enlarge the hilbert space by considering explicitly meson and @xmath0 d.o.f .  in order to start with a hermitean hamiltonian .",
    "the retarded interaction is then generated by meson - nucleon and @xmath8 vertices . for reasons of simplicity",
    ", we restrict ourselves in this work to configurations with only one meson present besides the baryons .",
    "special attention is laid on the question of nucleon dressing and the corresponding renormalization of operators as well as the fulfilment of two- and three - body unitarity . with respect to the latter ,",
    "we have incorporated the @xmath7 channel in a realistic model showing some interesting effects .",
    "the @xmath1 scattering @xmath9 matrix is derived , and the structure of the deuteron is discussed .",
    "a field theoretical realization in the form of a one - boson - exchange model is developed in sect .",

    "however , due to the truncation of the hilbert space with respect to the number of mesons , no explicit dressing of the bare nucleons is possible in @xmath11}_{\\delta } \\oplus { \\cal h}^{[n]}_{x}$ ] .",
    "this is one of the pathologies which one encounters in the one - meson - approximation .",
    "therefore , we will use the physical instead of the bare nucleon mass in @xmath11}_{\\delta } \\oplus { \\cal h}^{[n]}_{x}$ ] , so that the formally suppressed meson - nucleon loops can be taken into account at least effectively by the physical nucleon mass . for simplicity ,",

    "instead , we concentrate on the most important @xmath289 channel , because it is the only partial wave which couples to a @xmath2-@xmath290 state ( see table  [ kap6_partial ] ) and thus where one expects the strongest @xmath2 interaction effects .    in order to distinguish the various cases , we introduce as nomenclature `` cc(approach , mesons ) '' , where for `` approach '' we consider a retarded one ( `` ret '' ) and different static ones ( `` stat '' , `` stat1 '' , and `` stat2 '' ) .",
    "the entry `` meson '' refers to the mesons included in the @xmath2 interaction , i.e. , `` @xmath3 '' means only pion exchange and `` @xmath3 , @xmath21 , @xmath291 '' means @xmath3 and @xmath21 exchange including the additional coupling ( [ kap3_lagrange2_rnd ] ) whose strength is controlled by @xmath291 .",
    "we begin with the discussion of the parameter choices for the retarded approach as listed in table  [ kap6_tab1 ] . for @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and the cutoff @xmath292 ,",
    "we have chosen the values of the full bonn potential , i.e. , @xmath293 it turned out that for a variety of different combinations of the remaining parameters @xmath276 and @xmath294 a satisfactory description of the @xmath289 phase shift is possible .",
    "thus we have restricted the choice of @xmath276 to the values @xmath295 .",
    "the resulting cutoff masses @xmath294 are listed in table  [ kap6_tab1 ] as determined by a fit to the @xmath289 phase shift at @xmath296 mev .",

    "the choice @xmath298 can be motivated by vector dominance insofar as for this choice the @xmath299 vertex has the same spin structure as the dominant @xmath300 @xmath301 coupling .",

    "we would like to remind the reader that in this case _ all _ diagrams except the contribution ( c ) of fig .",

    "the resulting values are listed in table  [ kap6_tab2 ] . in the simplest approach , cc@xmath305 , which is identical to the one used in @xcite",
    ", we neglect the @xmath7 channel and the @xmath21 exchange in @xmath46}_{n\\delta}$ ] and @xmath46}_{\\delta \\delta}$ ] completely , e.g. , the @xmath135 interaction is solely given by @xmath3 exchange , where the cutoff @xmath306 is fitted to the @xmath289 partial wave at @xmath296 mev .",
    "the @xmath8 vertex @xmath307 is given by the parametrization ( [ kap3_form_paul ] ) of sauer _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "similar to the retarded case , we use these parameters ( [ kap3_form_paul ] ) also in the potential @xmath308 ( diagram ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ abb_delta ] ) .",
    "the second approach cc(stat2 , @xmath3 ) differs from cc(stat1 , @xmath3 ) only with respect to the parametrization ( [ kap3_form2 ] ) instead of ( [ kap3_form_paul ] ) for @xmath307 , e.g. , those values for @xmath307 are taken into account which are also present in our retarded approach .",
    "the choice ( [ kap3_form2 ] ) is also used in our third case cc(stat , @xmath309 ) .",
    "but in contrast to the previous cases , we incorporate in addition @xmath21 exchange in @xmath46}_{n\\delta}$ ] and @xmath46}_{\\delta \\delta}$ ] as well as the @xmath7 channel .",
    "furthermore , we set @xmath310",
    ".      we will start the discussion with the @xmath289 partial wave .",
    "as already mentioned , all three retarded potential models are able to describe its phase shift and inelasticity equally well in the @xmath0 region ( see fig .",
    "[ kap6_phasen_alpha1 ] ) .",
    "this is of course not very surprising because we had used this channel for fixing the free parameters .",
    "however , above @xmath311 mev one notes a rather large discrepancy between theory and experiment . in view of the fact that the parameter @xmath312 could not be fixed uniquely ,",
    "we have studied the influence of different choices for @xmath312 on the other partial waves .",
    "it turned out that the strongest dependence was found for the @xmath313 waves ( see fig .",
    "[ kap6_phasen_alpha2 ] ) .",
    "however , it was not possible to determine an optimal value for @xmath276 .",
    "while the @xmath314 inelasticity and the @xmath315 channel seem to favour @xmath316 , the value @xmath317 leads to a slightly better fit of the @xmath318 channel , especially for energies @xmath319 mev .",
    "but the overall description is still quite poor . on the other hand ,",
    "this rather unsatisfactory situation is not very surprising since we have not fitted our parameters to all partial waves simultaneously .",
    "now we will turn to the discussion of the various static and retarded approaches for the hadronic interaction .",
    "we have chosen the model cc(ret , @xmath309 ) as a starting point and compare it with the static approaches cc(stat1 , @xmath3 ) , cc(stat2 , @xmath3 ) , and cc(stat , @xmath309 ) for all @xmath320 partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath321 as shown in figs .",
    "[ kap6_phasen1_vergleich ] through [ kap6_phasen4_vergleich ] . with respect to the @xmath289 phase shift ,",
    "all four models yield more or less similar results .",
    "the inelasticity in cc(stat1 , @xmath3 ) and cc(stat2 , @xmath3 ) , however , is somewhat smaller than in the other two models . in accordance with @xcite",
    ", this behaviour can be traced back to the neglect of the @xmath7 channel in cc(stat1 , @xmath3 ) and cc(stat2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "for the other partial waves , the comparison with experimental data does not give a uniform picture .",
    "for example , the calculation cc(stat , @xmath309 ) yields the comparably best , but still not satisfactory description of the @xmath315 phase shift and the @xmath314 inelasticity . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical @xmath318 phase shift is largely at variance with the data , whereas cc(stat1 , @xmath3 ) and cc(stat2 , @xmath3 ) result in a rather good description .",
    "but in the @xmath322 and @xmath323 channels the retarded calculation cc(ret , @xmath309 ) is favoured .    in summary",
    ", one finds that our fit procedure leads to a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for the @xmath289 channel , which is the most important one in the @xmath0 resonance region .",
    "the overall description of the other channels is fairly well but needs further improvements .",
    "as a first step one would need to construct a potential model ( static or retarded ) in which _ all _ parameters are fitted simultaneously to _ all _ partial waves for energies up to about @xmath324 gev .",
    "this quite involved task will be one of our future projects .",
    "another remark is in order with respect to the question whether the static or the retarded interaction gives a better description .",
    "although in principle , from the basic physical ideas , a retarded interaction is more appropriate , our results for the pure hadronic reactions do not allow a clear answer . to this end",
    ", one has to consider e.m .",
    "reactions where first results  @xcite indicate a preference for the retarded interaction .",
    "this will be the subject of forthcoming papers .      in the coupled @xmath1-@xmath135 approach of leidemann _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the static reid soft core and argonne potentials have been used as starting point for the @xmath1 interaction , whereas the @xmath7 channel has been neglected .",
    "since the numerical calculations have been performed in r - space , nonlocalities , which are , for example , present in the @xmath135 propagation , could not be taken into account exactly .",
    "therefore , additional approximations in the box - renormalization procedure had been used which lead to a much more flexible treatment by introducing one additional free parameter for each @xmath1 partial wave .",
    "thus , compared with our results , a better description of @xmath1 scattering data was achieved because of this additional phenomenological ingredient . with respect to the static framework",
    ", we further would like to mention the work of wilbois  @xcite .",
    "among other things , he compared the results of a coupled channel approach for different static nn potentials ( bonn - obepr , bonn - obepq , paris and nijmegen ) .",
    "it turned out that the @xmath1 phase shifts and inelasticities are rather sensitive to the choice of the underlying @xmath1 potential .",
    "no @xmath1 potential , incorporated into the cc approach , has been able to produce a quantitative description of all @xmath1 phases and inelasticities in the @xmath0 resonance region .",
    "retarded approaches based on three - body theory @xcite have already been discussed in sect .  [ introduction ] . here",
    ", we want to consider in some more detail the work of bulla _",
    "et al_.  and elster _",
    "et al_.  @xcite",
    ". the coupled channel approach of @xcite , which includes an explicit @xmath235 vertex , differs at least in three important aspects compared to the present approach : ( i ) the @xmath7 channel is neglected .",
    "( ii ) retardation is treated only for pion exchange . for the cutoff mass of the corresponding @xmath235 vertex form factor",
    ", a very small value of 443 mev has been used in dipole parametrization as obtained from a fit of @xmath15 scattering data in the @xmath325 channel , whereas the value of 1700 mev in the elster potential results from a fit to @xmath1 scattering data .",
    "( iii ) the static paris potential is used as the underlying @xmath1 interaction . therefore , because of the renormalization procedure ( [ kap3_sau3 ] ) , the effective retarded ope potential is considerably weakened . in view of the points ( ii ) and ( iii ) , it is not very surprising that bulla _",
    "et al_.  found only a small influence from retardation , in fact much smaller than in our approach .",
    "moreover , due to the mixture of retarded and static frameworks it is rather questionable to apply this approach to electromagnetic reactions on the deuteron .",
    "for example , due to the existence of two different @xmath3 exchange mechanisms in the paris potential and the retarded interaction , two different types of mecs have to be constructed in order to guarantee gauge invariance - which is rather artificial .    in the work of elster _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , who have extended the bonn boson exchange potential into the region above pion threshold by the inclusion of the @xmath0 isobar , the interactions are treated in a retarded approach including appropriate nucleon and @xmath0 dressing .",
    "et al_.  start within a lee model framework whereas our retarded interactions are derived within time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast to our model , the @xmath7 channel as well as the @xmath288 transition potential ( diagram ( c ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ abb_delta ] ) are neglected , so that unitarity is violated above @xmath3 threshold . on the other hand , the @xmath0",
    "is treated relativistically whereas we describe it nonrelativistically .",
    "moreover , @xmath177 components are taken into account in @xcite .",
    "concerning the pure nucleonic sector , however , both approaches yield exactly the same interaction .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a hadronic interaction model which is suited for the study of electromagnetic and hadronic reactions in the two - nucleon sector for exitation energies up to about 500 mev , for example , @xmath1 scattering or electromagnetic deuteron break - up , in which not more than one pion is created or absorbed .",
    "this model respects in particular three - body unitarity .",
    "it is based on a previously developed model of sauer and collaborators @xcite which allows the explicit consideration of retardation in the two - body meson - exchange operators within a @xmath1-@xmath2 coupled channel approach using time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "since retarded interactions are not hermitean , we have generated the retarded one - boson exchange mechanisms by considering explicitly meson - nucleon and @xmath8 vertices .",
    "therefore , additional mesonic degrees of freedom besides the baryonic components had to be included explicitly into the hilbert space of a two - baryon system . in the present work , we have restricted ourselves to the one - meson - approximation , which means that we allow only configurations with one meson present besides the baryons . as mesons we have taken into account explicitly @xmath326 , and @xmath17 . in order to satisfy two- and three - body unitarity , we have incorporated the @xmath7 channel as well as intermediate pion - nucleon loops . in view of the latter mechanism , a distinction between bare and physical nucleons was necessary in order to avoid inconsistencies .    in our explicit realization within a field - theoretical framework ,",
    "we have used the realistic retarded potential model of elster _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as input for the basic nucleon - nucleon interaction in pure nucleonic space .",
    "this potential had to be renormalized because of the additional d.o.f . , which lead to further contributions from @xmath101 and @xmath7 states .",
    "because of some necessary approximations in our numerical evaluations , unitarity is not completely obeyed , which fact , however , we do not consider very critical .",
    "the free parameters of our model have been fixed by fitting @xmath15 scattering in the @xmath162 channel and @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath289 channel . for practical reasons , no global fit of the parameters to _ all _",
    "relevant @xmath1 or @xmath15 channels has been performed .",
    "therefore , the overall description ot the @xmath1 phase shifts and inelasticities is fairly well but needs some further improvement in the future .",
    "moreover , due to our fit procedure , there remain some ambiguities because not all parameters could be fitted uniquely .",
    "for example , besides the usual @xmath327 interaction density ( [ kap3_lagrange1_rnd ] ) we have incorporated an additional alternative ( [ kap3_lagrange2_rnd ] ) into the @xmath21 exchange of the @xmath328 transition , which has , at least to our knowledge , not yet been discussed in the literature .",
    "the corresponding coupling constant could not be fixed unambiguously by studying the @xmath289 partial wave alone . however , different choices of this coupling constant lead to rather drastic changes in the @xmath313 wave phase shifts in the @xmath0 region . for",
    "an improved description one would need to construct from scratch a hadronic interaction model which incorporates from the beginning nucleon , meson , and @xmath0 degrees of freedom and whose open parameters are fitted to the phase shifts and inelasticities of _ all relevant _ @xmath1 scattering partial waves for @xmath329 energies up to about 1 gev .",
    "another considerable improvement would be the implementation of the convolution approach of kvinikhidze and blankleider @xcite into our model .",
    "this would allow one to abandon the one - meson - approximation which causes several pathologies . from a conceptual point of view , this problem deserves further attention because it deals with the fundamental question of deriving off - shell properties of particles in a many - body system ( for example the dressing ) from those of a single - particle system without creating inconsistencies .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the present model is realistic enough for the study of electromagnetic reactions like photo- and electrodisintegration of the deuteron as well as pion production .",
    "the predictions for the observables of such reactions will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
