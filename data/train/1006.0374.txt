    "searches for missing baryon resonances in the strange sector have seen intense activity in recent years  @xcite , following theoretical predictions that several of these missing states have strong couplings to strange baryons  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on baryons , see ref .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction promises to play an important role in this regard .",
    "it is closely related to the @xmath14 reaction but differs in an important aspect . since @xmath15 is an isoscalar , only @xmath16 @xmath17 intermediate states can couple to @xmath18 ( isospin filter ) , while @xmath19 is an isovector , which allows it to couple to both @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath20 @xmath21 states .",
    "coupled - channel analyses of these reactions are thus anticipated to be of special interest  @xcite .",
    "the full scattering amplitude for @xmath22 photoproduction consists of eight complex production amplitudes corresponding to each of the two possible spin states of the incoming photon , target proton and outgoing hyperon .",
    "parity relations reduce the number of independent complex amplitudes to four  @xcite , or the number of independent real observables to eight , one of them being the differential cross section ( @xmath23 ) and the rest being a carefully chosen set of seven polarization observables  @xcite .",
    "because of the self - analyzing nature of the hyperon ( @xmath15 and @xmath19 ) decays , all seven of these polarization observables can be measured using different target and beam polarization configurations .",
    "it is thus possible to completely characterize the complex amplitude @xmath24 from experimental observations . with an unpolarized beam and an unpolarized target",
    "however , only the differential cross sections and recoil polarizations ( @xmath10 ) can be extracted .",
    "previous high statistics measurements for @xmath0 have been made by the clas  @xcite , saphir  @xcite , leps  @xcite , and graal  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the saphir @xmath23measurements covered center - of - mass energies ( @xmath1 ) from threshold ( 1.69  gev ) to 2.4  gev , while clas reached about 2.55  gev .",
    "agreement between the two data sets is fair , except in a few backward - angle bins where clas shows an enhancement around 2.2  gev , whereas saphir is more flat .",
    "the more recent leps experiment made precision measurements in the forward - angles for @xmath1 from 1.93  gev to 2.3  gev , and is in overall fair to good agreement with clas and saphir .",
    "world data on @xmath22 polarization is considerably more sparse , however .    in this paper , we report new measurements of @xmath23and the recoil polarization for @xmath25 using data taken at jefferson lab with the clas detector .",
    "we have utilized the decays @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and have performed separate analyses for the final - state topologies @xmath28  ( @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xmath31 , where the final - state particles that are not detected are shown in parentheses . our @xmath23measurements cover center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energies from near production threshold ( @xmath32  gev ) to @xmath33  gev , in 10-mev - wide bins .",
    "we also cover a wide angular range of @xmath34 , everywhere except the extreme forward- and backward - angles .",
    "our angular binning is 0.1 in @xmath35 . for the recoil polarization @xmath36 , where available , we present results only from the @xmath28  ( @xmath29 topology , which allows us to preserve the spin - transfer information between the @xmath19 and the @xmath15 in the @xmath26 decay ( see sec",

[ section : pol]b ) . in the backward - angle and near - threshold bins , where statistics are extremely limited for the @xmath28  ( @xmath29 topology , our @xmath36 measurements are from the @xmath30  ( @xmath37 topology instead . for the most part , these results are in excellent agreement with the previous clas results  @xcite . in a few cases , the polarizations reported are not consistent with earlier measurements .",
    "these new measurements supersede the previous ( lower statistics ) clas results .",
    "theoretical and phenomenological model fits to previous world data incorporating intermediate resonances have typically suffered from the problem of ambiguity .",
    "that is , fits with different resonance contribution hypotheses gave comparable @xmath38 values .",
    "for example , it has long been known that there is a `` structure '' at around 1900  mev in both the @xmath39 and @xmath22 differential cross sections .",
    "mart and bennhold  @xcite first pointed out that for @xmath39 , this structure could be explained by the @xmath40 `` missing '' resonance .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite extended this model to @xmath22 and included the @xmath41 and @xmath42 resonances as well .",
    "they found that @xmath40 did not significantly improve the global fit quality for this channel and claimed that @xmath9-channel non - resonant processes could have a significant contribution instead .",
    "various other groups  @xcite have incorporated several other resonances , but it is fair to say that none of the models are conclusive .",
    "part of the problem lies in the fact that there has been very little data on the polarization observables , the aforementioned model fits being primarily based on cross section data .",
    "the problem is even more acute for the @xmath19 , where the polarization is inherently `` diluted '' compared to the @xmath15 ( this point is elaborated in sec .",
    "[ section : pol]b ) .",
    "high precision polarization measurements such as the current results are , therefore , much needed . with a finer binning in both energy and angular kinematic variables ,",
    "several new features can be seen that were not apparent earlier .",
    "for instance , the saphir paper  @xcite noted that in accordance with quark model predictions , their data were consistent with @xmath13 , i.e. , within their measurement uncertainties , the @xmath15 and @xmath19 recoil polarizations had comparable magnitudes and opposite signs .",
    "our data show that this is not obeyed globally .",
    "the quark model assumes the same production mechanism for both hyperons , which can be badly broken in the resonance region if different resonances contribute to @xmath15 and @xmath19 production .",
    "given that @xmath43 states can couple only to @xmath22 and not @xmath39 , this scenario can not be ruled out .",
    "secondly , the treatment of non - resonant @xmath8- and @xmath9-channel contributions needs to be better understood .",
    "the quality of previous world data in the backward - angles has been found to be especially poor .",
    "the present data demonstrate a significant rise in the cross sections at backward - angles , pointing strongly to @xmath9-channel contributions , and therefore lend support to the same conclusion mentioned above from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results have the largest kinematic coverage and represent the most precise measurements for this reaction that are available to date .",
    "in addition to the observables reported here , the leps collaboration  @xcite and the graal collaboration  @xcite have also measured photon - beam asymmetries for this channel , while the frost experiment at clas / jlab  @xcite will measure several other single- and double - polarization observables .",
    "the present work is part of a larger program within the clas collaboration to make precision measurements for several photoproduction channels  @xcite , with the goal of performing a coupled - channel partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) .",
    "the data used in this analysis were obtained using real photons produced via bremsstrahlung from a 4.023-gev electron beam produced by the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) at jefferson lab .",
    "the photons were energy tagged by measuring the momenta of the recoiling electrons with a dipole magnet and scintillator hodoscope system  @xcite , resulting in a tagged photon energy range of @xmath44 to @xmath45  gev for the current experiment .",
    "a separate set of scintillators was used to make accurate timing measurements .",
    "the photon energy resolution was about @xmath46 of the incident beam energy and the timing resolution was 120  ps .",
    "these tagged photons were directed toward a @xmath47-cm - long cylindrical liquid - hydrogen cryotarget inside the cebaf large angle spectrometer ( clas ) detector system , which collected data events produced by scattering . immediately surrounding the target cell was a `` start counter '' scintillator , used in the event trigger .    both the start counter and the clas detector were segmented into sectors with a six - fold azimuthal symmetry about the beam line .",
    "a non - uniform toroidal magnetic field with a peak strength of 1.8  t was used to bend the trajectories of charged particles and a series of drift chambers was used for charged particle tracking . in this manner , clas could detect charged particles and reconstruct their momenta over a large fraction of the @xmath48 solid angle .",
    "the overall momentum resolution of the detector was @xmath49 .",
    "a system of @xmath50 scintillators placed outside the magnetic field and drift chamber regions provided timing information by measuring the time - of - flight ( tof ) for each charged particle trajectory . a fast triggering and fast data - acquisition system ( capable of running at @xmath51  khz ) allowed for operating at a photon flux of a few times @xmath52  photons / s .",
    "further details of clas can be found in ref .",
    "the specific data set that we analyze in this work was collected in the summer of 2004 , during the clas `` @xmath53 '' run period .",
    "roughly 20 billion triggers were recorded during this time , out of which only a small fraction corresponded to @xmath22 events .",
    "each event trigger required a coincidence between the photon tagger master or ( mor ) and the clas level 1 trigger .",
    "for each charged particle to trigger individually , a coincidence between the tof counter scintillator hit time and the start counter hit time for that particle was required . for the level 1 trigger to fire , two particles in two different sectors of clas ( `` two - prong '' trigger ) were required to trigger within a 150  ns coincidence time window .",
    "the final requirement was a coincidence between the tagger mor and the start counter or within a timing window of 15  ns .",
    "also , only the first 40 tagger counters ( corresponding to the higher end of the photon energy spectrum ) were included in the trigger .    during offline processing , before any physics analysis began , the clas detector sub - systems had to be calibrated .",
    "this included determining the relative offsets between the photon tagger , start counter and tof counter times , as well as calibration of the drift times in the drift chambers and the pulse heights of the tof scintillators .",
    "energy and momentum corrections were made for individual particles to account for their energy and momentum losses during passage through several layers of the detector sub - systems .",
    "corrections were also made to the incident photon energy ( @xmath54 ) to account for mechanical sagging in the tagger hodoscope .",
    "a detailed discussion of the collection and calibration of this data set can be found in refs .",
    "in the reaction @xmath55 , the @xmath19 subsequently decays as @xmath56 @xmath57 of the time .",
    "the @xmath15 further decays into @xmath58 ( charged mode ) with a @xmath59 branching fraction and the rest of the time mostly into @xmath60 ( neutral mode ) .",
    "since clas was optimized for detecting charged particles , we only use the charged decay mode of the @xmath15 in this analysis .",
    "the `` three - track '' topology was then defined as @xmath61(@xmath4 ) , where all three final state charged particles were detected and the outgoing photon was reconstructed from the missing momentum using a 1-constraint kinematic fit to zero total missing mass .",
    "this topology had a number of benefits .",
    "for example , the @xmath15 decay vertex could be reconstructed from proton and @xmath62 tracking information , leading to better energy loss corrections for these particles .",
    "although the detection of the @xmath62 helped in the overall event reconstruction for the three - track topology , it also led to a reduction in the acceptance .",
    "negatively charged particles ( like @xmath62 ) were bent inwards toward the beam line , where the clas detector has its lowest acceptance .    to circumvent the above problem",
    ", we also examined the `` two - track '' topology , defined as @xmath63(@xmath6 ) , where only the @xmath2 and the proton were detected . with one less particle being detected ,",
    "the acceptance was higher than in the three - track case , especially for the lower - energy and backward - angle regions .",
    "the two - track topology thus allowed for differential cross section measurements to be made from energies close to the @xmath22 production threshold and to cover almost the entire range in @xmath64 .",
    "data samples for both topologies were then binned in 10-mev - wide @xmath1 bins for further analysis .",
    ".[table : pid_cuts ] list of cuts applied to the two topologies in this analysis .",
    "the confidence level and @xmath39 removal cuts used kinematic fitting that required the @xmath62 to be detected and could be applied to the three - track topology only .",

    "since the majority of our polarization results come from the three - track data set that avoids this dilution , they represent an improvement not just in terms of greater statistical precision , but also in terms of an additional physics precision .",
    "structures that were hinted at by earlier measurements are now mapped out in much greater detail . in the three angular bins @xmath109 , 0.5 and 0.7",
    ", there are a few localized discrepancies between the present results and earlier clas measurements  @xcite .",
    "we are uncertain of the precise origin of these discrepancies , but given that the present analysis incorporates a vast improvement in statistical precision , makes use of more sophisticated analysis tools and have been checked for internal consistency , the present results supersede the earlier measurements by clas .             for @xmath15  @xcite ( blue squares ) and @xmath19 ( red up - triangles ) photoproduction from proton and @xmath110  @xcite ( green down - triangles ) photoproduction from deuterium .",
    "except for the extreme forward - angles , all three hyperon channels show a similar peak at @xmath111  gev .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the most prominent feature in our differential cross section results is the peak at 1900  mev , visible over the entire angular range .",
    "this is not a new feature by itself  @xcite , but its interpretation in terms of @xmath112-channel baryon resonances has been highly controversial . in the introduction section , we pointed out several possible states , e.g. @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , claimed by different groups .",
    "more recently , the bonn - gatchina group  @xcite has claimed that a positive - parity @xmath113 state with a two - star rating in the pdg is able to account for features in both the differential cross section and polarization .",
    "there is also a possibility that this structure might not be a `` resonance '' _ per se _ , but simply a strangeness threshold phenomenon .",
    "the @xmath114-@xmath115 bound state mass representing the strangeness threshold is also around 1.9  gev and it has been shown by brodsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that at low energies , via pure gluonic exchanges , qcd can give rise to an attractive van der waals force , so that @xmath114 and @xmath115 can indeed bind .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent clas @xmath116 photoproduction data  @xcite also show a prominent peak at around 1.9  gev .",
    "[ fig : pinscaled ] shows the differential cross sections for the three hyperons @xmath15 , @xmath19 and @xmath110 at @xmath117 .",
    "it was pointed out in a previous clas paper  @xcite that @xmath118 scaled differential cross sections ( @xmath119 ) at @xmath120 also show a similar `` rise '' commencing from around 1.9  gev .",
    "it is therefore possible that all these structures are connected to the same universal @xmath121 production threshold .",
    "the structure at @xmath122  gev in the backward - angles is also quite interesting .",
    "recently , the leps collaboration  @xcite has published @xmath123 photoproduction results at backward - angles that show a bump - like structure in the differential cross sections at around @xmath124  gev .",
    "the claim has been that the bump is absent in the @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 channels , pointing towards the conjecture that it is due to some resonance that couples strongly to the strange sector ( the @xmath128 has a higher @xmath121 component than @xmath125 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the structures seen in the @xmath128 and @xmath19 channels are related .",
    "one of the long - standing issues in model calculations has been the contribution from background non - resonant processes .",
    "the additional 300-mev coverage at the higher energy end provided by our results should be very useful in clearing up this issue . at high @xmath1 , where there are presumably few @xmath112-channel resonance contributions ,",
    "@xmath8-channel processes are known to dominate at forward - angles . in the regge description , for high @xmath112 forward - scattering ,",
    "the production amplitude should scale as @xmath129 , where the mandelstam variable @xmath8 denotes the exchange momentum squared and @xmath130 is the regge trajectory of the exchanged particle ( reggeon ) . since @xmath131 , @xmath132",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is an `` effective '' regge trajectory for multiple reggeon exchange .",
    "such an @xmath135 ( signifying @xmath136 ) scaling was already seen at lower energies ( @xmath137  gev ) in the previous clas analysis by bradford _",
    "et al . _",
    "a very similar scaling phenomena is seen in the present data at the highest energies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regge_scaling]a .",
    "following guidal _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the previous clas paper  @xcite also pointed out that if one assumes the @xmath8-channel processes to be dominated by @xmath2 and @xmath138 exchanges , the effective regge trajectory could be simply explained as @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "the guidal - laget - vanderhaeghen paper  @xcite also pointed out that a similar scaling should be observed at high @xmath112 , @xmath141 ( backward - angle scattering ) .",
    "however , previous world data did not have enough statistical precision at backward - angles to demonstrate this conclusively .",
    "[ fig : regge_scaling]b shows the @xmath9-channel scaling behavior in the present analysis , as demonstrated by the strongly collimated peak as @xmath142 decreases .",
    "we also found that an @xmath143 scaling worked better than @xmath135 here .",
    "since the reggeons involved in @xmath9-channel exchanges are the @xmath15 s and @xmath144 s , @xmath145 at @xmath141  @xcite , which leads to a scaling power of @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the scaling power is steeper than @xmath135 .",
    "the overall trend of the polarization seems to be that @xmath10 is large and positive in the forward - angles and tends toward zero or negative values in the backward - angles .",
    "many local structures are visible , especially in the backward - angle bins , possibly from resonance contributions , though the variations are smoother than seen in @xmath39  @xcite . in the static quark model ,",
    "assuming an approximate @xmath12 symmetry  @xcite , the spin - flavor configurations of the two hyperons are @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , it follows that @xmath149 .",
    "a new feature that we see from the present results is that this prediction is explicitly broken in certain kinematic regions .",
    "[ fig : klam_ksig_pol ] shows this for one region , where @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath10 are both non - zero and have the same sign .",
    "similar features are visible in several other mid- and backward - angle bins , but not in any of the forward - angle bins . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath12 prediction is not observed globally .",
    "of course , @xmath12 is known to be a broken symmetry , and it is an interesting question by itself , as to why the @xmath13 prediction seems to hold at high @xmath1 and forward - angles .",
    "a possible answer may lie in the fact that the static quark model assumes that the production mechanisms for both hyperons are the same .",
    "this hypothesis no longer holds if @xmath43 resonances contribute to the @xmath22 production , and @xmath12 can be broken explicitly .",
    "we have presented high statistics measurements of differential cross sections and recoil polarizations for the reaction @xmath0 from production threshold to @xmath150  gev with a wide angular coverage , using the clas detector at jefferson lab ( electronic versions of the data can be found in ref .",
    "these new results significantly extend the previous @xmath22 world data on two separate fronts .",
    "firstly , these precision polarization measurements will place additional constraints on future theoretical modeling of this reaction , and thereby help remove some of the ambiguities that presently plague this field .",
    "we find that the @xmath12 prediction of @xmath13 is explicitly broken in some of the mid- and backward - angle bins , although it seems to be valid in the forward - angle bins .",
    "a possible explanation could be that for certain kinematic regions , the @xmath18 and @xmath151 productions proceed via different reaction mechanisms ; however , this needs to be better understood .",
    "secondly , the 300-mev extension in energy coverage improves our understanding of the role non - resonant processes play in the reaction mechanism .",
    "our data demonstrate that there is a significant @xmath9-channel contribution for this reaction , and is consistent with @xmath9-channel regge exchanges of @xmath15 and @xmath144 hyperons .",
    "the forward - angle region is mostly dominated by @xmath8-channel processes . in the mid- and backward - angle regions , @xmath112-channel and @xmath9-channel amplitudes",
    "are expected to dominate , and these will interfere with each other .",
    "therefore , it is important to cleanly separate the @xmath9-channel contribution before claiming the presence of any @xmath112-channel resonances .    in a forthcoming work , we will present a coupled - channel partial - wave analysis incorporating the present work and the latest clas results for the @xmath39  @xcite and @xmath123/@xmath152  @xcite channels .",
    "each of these reactions has a relatively high strangeness content and is therefore expected to couple to a similar set of @xmath112-channel resonances .",
    "additionally , all four analyses come from same data set and use similar analysis techniques , which should better keep systematic uncertainties under control as well .",
