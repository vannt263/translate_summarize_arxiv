    "the qcd equation of state can be derived from the partition function @xmath0 in lattice qcd with 2 + 1 flavours @xmath1 has been evaluated by the hotqcd  @xcite and wuppertal - budapest  @xcite collaborations producing different results for the trace anomaly at temperatures above @xmath2 , already beyond the hadron  quark - gluon crossover  @xcite . on the other hand , quark - hadron duality at finite temperature",
    "requires that for confined states @xmath3 should be determined from _ all _ stable hadron states such as those in the pdg booklet  @xcite .",
    "this is the idea behind the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) , a multicomponent gas of non - interacting massive stable and point - like particles  @xcite which has historically arbitrated the discrepancies between different lattice groups  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the disagreement still persists beyond the expected range of validity of the hrg model ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : hw - hag ] , right ) .    the special role played by the hrg does not make it a theorem and corrections to it are not completely clear as pdg hadrons are composite , have finite size and width . on the lattice ,",
    "the validity of the hrg has been checked in the strong coupling limit and for heavy quarks to lowest orders  @xcite . in the usual large @xmath4-limit ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and references therein ) where hadrons become stable resonances , @xmath5 , the mesons give a finite contribution as their mass and degeneracy are finite whereas baryons would provide a vanishing contribution .",
    "the half - width rule  @xcite applied to pdg resonances  @xcite provides compatible uncertainties with current lattice calculations  @xcite .    to saturate the partition function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zt ] ) with light or heavy quarks a large number of highly excited states is needed so relativistic corrections are important . here",
    ", we will use the mit bag model  @xcite and the relativized quark model ( rqm ) of refs .",
    "@xcite which treats hadrons as extended bound states rather than resonances .",
    "the trace anomaly measures departures from scale invariance and reads @xmath6 after using standard thermodynamics relations for the energy density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath8 . for the hrg model",
    "we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponds to fermions / bosons and @xmath12 is the cumulative number ( @xmath13 is the step function ) .",
    "hagedorn proposed that the cumulative number of hadrons in qcd is approximately and asymptotically given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant and @xmath16 is the so called hagedorn temperature .",
    "we show results in fig .",
    "[ fig : hw - hag ] both for @xmath17 and @xmath18 fitted with @xmath19 and @xmath20 and also showing the good performance of the hrg below @xmath21 when the rqm is used .",
    "the polyakov loop is a purely gluonic operator , which in gluodynamics becomes a true order parameter as it signals the breaking of the center symmetry and deconfinement . unlike the trace anomaly ,",
    "there is lattice consensus on this observable  @xcite so its analysis may be more credible . we have shown that in qcd  @xcite and in chiral quark models  @xcite a hadronic representation exists and is given by ( @xmath22 is the gluon field ) @xmath23 where the cumulative number reads now @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the degeneracies and @xmath26 are the masses of hadrons with exactly one heavy quark ( the mass of the heavy quark itself @xmath27 being subtracted ) .",
    "the result with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 quarks , computed in the rqm  @xcite when the large but finite charmed quark mass , @xmath31 ( using @xmath32-quarks does not change much ) , is taken is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : heavy ] .",
    "we have checked that results are not very sensitive to use bottom quarks instead .",
    "a fit @xmath33 to the total contribution produces @xmath34 and @xmath35 for single - charmed , bottom hadrons for the range @xmath36 .",
    "the results from pdg and rqm are multiplied by a factor @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , which comes from an arbitrariness in the renormalization .",
    "the sum rule has been implemented on the lattice recently  @xcite .",
    "in the quantum virial expansion  @xcite , the excluded volume corrections come from repulsive interactions whereas resonance contributions stem from attractive interactions . a good example is @xmath39 scattering where one has attractive and resonanting states in the isospin @xmath40 corresponding to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 resonances whereas one has a repulsive core in the @xmath43 exotic channel  @xcite providing a measure of the finite pion size .",
    "in contrast , the hrg assumes point - like elementary particles .",
    "however , in the narrow width limit resonances also have a finite size as they become bound states .",
    "clearly , when hadrons overlap , the hrg model becomes invalid since the pauli principle blocks many states allowed by colour neutrality .",
    "the non - overlapping condition corresponds to the inequality for the co - volume @xmath44 the hadron size can be estimated from the mit bag model where one has  @xcite @xmath45 . in the rqm  @xcite",
    "one might compute the size directly from the m.s.r . of the wave functions . a meson model of the form @xmath46 with @xmath47 yields after minimizing @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : covol ] we see that for @xmath49 hadrons overlap and the hrg departs from the lattice qcd results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hw - hag ] , left ) .",
    "the cumulative numbers computed in the rqm exhibit lower thresholds for mesons than baryons but the latter dominate due to the larger multiplicity of @xmath50 than @xmath51 states , and eventually an exponential growth characterized by a hagedorn temperature seems to set in ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hw - hag ] and [ fig : heavy ] ) . due to the finite number of degrees of freedom",
    "both mesons and baryons have a power - like behaviour for large masses @xmath52 producing a dimensional estimate @xmath53 and @xmath54 featuring the available phase space .",
    "an intriguing issue is under what conditions this exponential growth goes on high up in the spectrum as initially speculated by hagedorn  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : covol ] ( right ) we show @xmath55 in the mit bag model including also the exotic tetraquark @xmath56 states as independent hadronic states .",
    "the fit yields @xmath57 , complying with the bootstrap mechanism proposed long ago  @xcite .",
    "since some of the tetraquark states are of molecular nature , it is unclear if they should be incorporated in the cumulative number .",
    "this is related to the completeness or redundancy of hadronic states , particularly in the pdg as noted in  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical analysis of the hadronic spectrum has an increasing lack of energy resolution for increasing temperatures and a slowly converging pattern requiring many excited states . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice calculations become difficult at very low temperatures where the main energy gaps are found .",
    "while this explains why the hrg model works well as function of temperature it is not obvious how to systematically compute deviations from this simple limit .",
