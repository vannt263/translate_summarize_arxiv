    "ngc 3998 also hosts a time variable , compact core , flat - spectrum radio source @xcite and two extended regions , described as double lobes by @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 3998 is also variable in the ultra - violet ( uv ) as summarized by @xcite and in x - rays @xcite .",
    "@xcite have compiled the radio to x - ray spectral energy distribution revealing that the nucleus of ngc 3998 is radiating at 4 x 10@xmath17 of the eddington luminosity limit .",
    "spectroscopically , the nucleus of ngc 3998 is classified as a liner , with broad h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 emission lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and a broad mg ii @xmath182800 emission line @xcite which did not vary during the 3 year span of the @xmath19 observations .",
    "little is known about the time variability , or lack thereof , for the broad emission lines seen in the visible .",
    "ngc 3998 has been a frequent target for the @xmath0 .",
    "visible and uv spectra have been obtained with the @xmath20 at three different epochs spanning 5 years , from 1997 to 2002 , allowing an investigation of whether or not the broad emission lines ( bels ) respond to the aforementioned continuum variations .",
    "additionally , the @xmath13 spectroscopy was obtained with considerably higher angular and spectral resolution than the @xmath21 observations .",
    "thus , the @xmath13 observations provide a renewed opportunity to investigate the origin of the uv continuum and the excitation of the associated emission lines for an unresolved but smaller @xmath4 14 pc diameter region centered on the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "ngc 3998 is one of an important subset of single peaked broad line agns whose central mass has been measured @xcite . since the broad line region ( blr ) is unresolved , the spatial distribution of emission can not be directly measured .",
    "however , the three dimensional gravitational field strength is known , thus the relationship between velocity and radius may be established , given a kinematic model for the broad emission line gas . in this way",
    ", one can , in principle , exploit the exquisite velocity resolution of @xmath22 to model the broad emission line profiles and determine a size for the blr that heretofore has previously only been possible using reverberation mapping techniques @xcite .",
    "profile fitting complements reverberation mapping as the latter yields blr sizes for a different sample of more luminous agns .",
    "ngc 3398 radiates well below the eddington luminosity limit and is unable to drive an outflow thereby simplifying the interpretation of the broad emission lines by eliminating one of the possible explanations for their origin .",
    "the wider context for this investigation is to better understand the origin of single peaked broad lines , as these are by far the most ubiquitous type of broad line associated with agns @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 3 ,",
    "the bels seen in ngc 3998 are evaluated in the context of the various models proposed for their origin , namely inflow , outflow , rotating gas disks and the atmospheres of stars illuminated by the agn .",
    "viable models are discussed in section 4 with the conclusion following in section 5 that inflow provides the best explanation for the bels in ngc 3998 .",
    "we begin , however , with section 2 and a review of the emission lines observed in the nucleus of ngc 3998 .",
    "ngc 3998 has been observed with @xmath23 twice using the g750 m grating , twice using the g430l grating and one time using each of the g230l and the g140l gratings .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observations and the resulting spectra are presented in fig 1 .",
    "a @xmath23 spectrum showing the broad h@xmath1 emission line has been presented previously by @xcite based on observations obtained under pid 7354 .",
    "@xcite presented the g430l spectrum obtained under pid 8839 .",
    "however , the g130l and g230l spectra are shown for the first time in fig . 1 .",
    "multiple exposures obtained using the same grating and with the same integration time have been combined using the @xmath24 task @xmath25 .",
    "dithered exposures were shifted using the @xmath24 task @xmath26 prior to combining .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath24 task @xmath27 was used to perform a 7 pixel wide extraction along the slit direction and centered on the nucleus .",
    "each extraction samples @xmath6 80% of the encircled energy for an unresolved point source @xcite .",
    "the g750 m spectra reveal a broad h@xmath1 line with a fwhm @xmath4 2000 km / s .",
    "another broad line appears at @xmath4 6650 but this is actually a blend of two [ sii ] lines .",
    "the two sets of g750 m spectra are virtually identical even though the observations are separated by four years .",
    "the g430l spectrum reveals a wide swath of emission lines and is virtually identical to the one obtained two years later .",
    "collectively , the g750 m and g430l spectra resolve the h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 lines .",
    "the g240l spectrum reveals the broad mg ii @xmath182800 and the bright c ii ] @xmath182326 line reported previously by @xcite .",
    "however , the higher signal to noise ratio and spectral resolution of the modern spectra reveal many more emission lines on a flat continuum that extends into the g140l spectrum which also shows a broad he ii @xmath181650 emission line , strongly absorbed c iv @xmath181549 and ly@xmath1 emission and several other absorption lines . a more detailed description of the spectra follows , beginning with the hydrogen ( h ) balmer lines .",
    "the broad h@xmath1 emission line profile is featureless and is virtually identical in the two separate g750 m observations .",
    "there is no direct evidence for the [ n ii ] vacuum wavelength 6549.85 and 6585.28  emission lines in a 7 pixel extraction centered on the nucleus .",
    "such lines are expected , however , if only due to foreground gas in the host galaxy , plus , they are seen in @xmath23 observations of other agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "evidently , they must be overwhelmed by the broad h@xmath1 emission in ngc 3398 .",
    "consequently , a model for the [ n ii ] emission lines is employed which , following their subtraction , will yield a more realistic estimate for the broad h@xmath1 emission line flux .",
    "a systemic velocity of 1206 km / s is deduced from the peak of the h@xmath2 emission line which can be clearly seen in the g430l spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) . atomic physics sets the wavelength of the fainter [ n ii ] line relative to the brighter [ n ii ] line , it constrains the flux of the fainter [ n ii ] line to be 1/3 that of the brighter [ n ii ] line , and requires that the [ n ii ] lines share the same width . a single component gaussian with a width of 1000 km / s was chosen for the [ n ii ] lines , similar to the model for the flanking [ o i ] and [ s ii ] emission lines , motivated by the fact that these forbidden lines have similar widths in @xmath22 spectra of other agns for which the lines can be clearly seen @xcite .",
    "the flux for the brightest [ n ii ] emission line has been chosen so that the difference spectrum does not show an ` over - subtraction ' of the broad h@xmath1 profile .",
    "the procedure is valid because the observed broad h@xmath1 emission line profile is otherwise smoothly varying . since the [ n ii ] lines are not directly observed , this procedure effectively sets an upper limit on the [ n ii ] line fluxes and a lower limit to the flux of the broad h@xmath1 emission line . the flux for the @xmath28 component of the h@xmath1 line is poorly constrained .",
    "however , inspection of @xmath22 spectra for other agns reveals that the @xmath28 component of the h@xmath1 line is almost always fainter than the brightest [ n ii ] line @xcite which motivated the model shown in fig .",
    "although subjective , the model for the superimposed lines is vindicated as the difference spectrum reveals a broad h@xmath1 line profile that is very similar to the h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 lines described in the next section .",
    "the @xmath24 contributed task @xmath29 was used to model and subtract the forbidden lines and the results are reported in table 2 along with the fluxes for the two broad [ s ii ] vacuum wavelength @xmath186718.29 and @xmath186732.67  emission lines and the two broad [ o i ] vacuum wavelength @xmath186302.04 and @xmath186365.53  emission lines .",
    "the broad h@xmath1 emission line flux deduced from the g750 m spectra is @xmath4 70% larger than estimated previously by @xcite using ground based observations with good agreement on the broad line width .",
    "figure 2 illustrates that the consequence of subtracting the forbidden emission line model is to reveal a broad h@xmath1 emission line symmetric about the @xmath186591 wavelength expected for the systemic velocity of 1206 km / s .",
    "thus , there is no apparent redshift between the broad h@xmath1 emission line and the systemic redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "3 ) and h@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "4 ) emission lines are virtually identical in the two separate observations obtained using the g430l grating .",
    "they are compromised only slightly by [ o iii ] emission lines which were modeled and subtracted using the @xmath24 contributed task @xmath29 as illustrated in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "the [ o iii ] vacuum wavelength @xmath184364.44  deserved special attention as it is very faint and unresolved .",
    "a model was employed for the [ o iii ] @xmath184364.44 line in which the wavelength and line width was fixed and the flux adjusted so as to not over - subtract the h@xmath3 line in the difference spectrum ( fig .",
    "this yielded the upper limit for the [ o iii ] @xmath18 4364.44 line reported in table 3 . subtracting the [ o iii ]",
    "lines reveals broad h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 emission lines , both of which are symmetric about the central wavelengths expected for a systemic velocity of 1206 km / s .",
    "unfortunately the analysis can not reliably be extended to include other balmer lines as they are simply too faint and even more confused with emission from other ions .",
    "consequently , emission line fluxes are reported in table 3 for all the lines that can be reliably resolved and measured in the g430l spectrum including h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , the blend of the vacuum wavelength @xmath303727.09 , 3729.88  [ o ii ] lines , the two [ o iii ] vacuum wavelength @xmath184960.30  and @xmath185008.24  emission lines , and the upper limit for the vacuum wavelength @xmath184364.44  [ o iii ] emission line .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the striking similarity between the three broad h balmer lines in ngc 3998 when they are normalized to their respective peak intensities and the wavelength scales converted to velocity using the non - relativistic doppler equation .",
    "the similarity between the emission line profiles is particularly impressive considering the variety of models employed to subtract the superimposed forbidden lines .",
    "the balmer line profiles are similar to those seen in m81 @xcite if slightly narrower .",
    "such single peaked line profiles may be produced by radiation from a spherically symmetric shell of gas in radial motion as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "single peaked emission line profiles may also be produced by accretion disks @xcite , bipolar flows @xcite and the atmospheres of stars orbiting close to the agn @xcite .",
    "each of these models will be discussed further in section 4 .",
    "the observed balmer decrements , h@xmath1/h@xmath2 = 3.43 @xmath31 0.05 and h@xmath2/h@xmath3 = 2.83 @xmath31 0.11 , are significantly different from the case b values , 2.75 and 2.1 , respectively in the sense that the observed values are systematically 25% and 35% higher , respectively .",
    "interpreting these ratios in terms of dust extinction leads to a color excess @xmath32 @xmath4 0.2 mag and @xmath4 0.7 mag respectively , values that are inconsistent with each other and higher than the @xmath4 0.1 mag of reddening estimated to the agn x - ray emission by @xcite .",
    "such deviations from recombination theory have been noted for other liners ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have been attributed to collisional excitation in gas of high density .",
    "however , the requisite high densities are not achieved in the region producing the broad emission lines in ngc 3998 as explained further in section 4.5 .",
    "a very broad vacuum wavelength @xmath182798  mg ii emission line appears in the g230l spectrum .",
    "strong absorption prevents an accurate determination of the central wavelength but adopting a systemic velocity of 1206 km / s for ngc 3998 leads to the conclusion that the mg ii line is asymmetric with more emission on the blue side compared to the red side . with a fwhm @xmath4 6000 km / s , and a fwzi @xmath4 13000 km / s ,",
    "the mg ii line is by far the broadest emission line detected in ngc 3998 .",
    "the mg ii emission line flux noted in table 4 agrees reasonably well with an @xmath21 measurement reported previously by @xcite as does the vacuum wavelength @xmath182324  c ii ] emission line flux .",
    "the c ii ] emission line is much narrower than the mg ii emission line , as already noted by @xcite , but the modern spectrum shows that the c ii ] emission line is broader than the h balmer lines and shares an asymmetry similar to the mg ii emission line .",
    "other emission lines are detected in the g230l spectrum , the most important of which are an unresolved pair of [ o ii ] lines with a vacuum wavelength of @xmath182471  .",
    "the [ o ii ] lines have a high critical density corresponding to @xmath4 4 @xmath710@xmath33 @xmath9 and provide an important data point for the line width - critical density relation described in the next section .",
    "ngc 3998 is very unusual in that it exhibits a number of broad forbidden lines which are as broad as the h balmer lines thus blurring the distinction between the canonical @xmath34 and @xmath28 line regions in this agn .",
    "a comparison of the line widths is illustrated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 where the fwhm has been plotted against the ionization potential for forbidden and permitted lines whose line widths could be measured .",
    "although the line widths are technically _ broad _ it is a misnomer to refer to them as originating from a _ broad line region_. this is because the forbidden line widths are comparable to the balmer line widths which is an attribute of the _ narrow line region_. thus , to avoid confusion , henceforth , the emission lines will be referred to as originating from a _ broad emission line region _",
    "( belr ) , the physical properties of which are the main focus of this paper .",
    "the [ s ii ] and [ o iii ] lines , in particular , will provide an important measure of the electron number density and temperature , respectively , for the belr of ngc 3998 as discussed further in section 4 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 illustrates that there is no correlation between the line width and critical density for the forbidden lines in ngc 3998 .",

    "the g140l spectrum reveals a flat uv continuum and absorption features including",
    "n v @xmath181241 , si ii @xmath181260 , si iv @xmath301394 , 1403 , cii @xmath181335 and tentatively si ii @xmath30 1304,1309 and o i @xmath351302 , 1304 , 1306 .",
    "tentative because the absorption feature appears wider than the wavelength spread of the lines attributed to it .",
    "all of the absorption features can be identified with resonance lines and are most likely produced by absorption within the host galaxy because their central wavelengths imply a redshift that corresponds to the systemic velocity of ngc 3998 .",
    "the flat uv continuum can be traced back to the visible through the g230l , g430l and g750 m spectra .",
    "a radiatively driven outflow of gas can be ruled out for ngc 3998 because the diminutive luminosity generated by the agn is simply unable to provide sufficient radiation pressure to overcome the gravitational force of the bh as demonstrated in the following .",
    "the condition for a radiatively driven wind is given by ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mass and luminosity respectively , interior to a radius @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the speed of light , and @xmath41 the gravitational constant . for ngc 3998 ,",
    "this condition is not satisfied by three orders of magnitude , if one adopts the thompson scattering opacity @xmath42 = 0.4 @xmath43/g for a pure hydrogen gas , @xmath37 = 2.7 @xmath7 10@xmath16 m@xmath11 @xcite , and a bolometric luminosity , @xmath38 = 3.5 @xmath7 10@xmath44 l@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the disparity is simply too large to overcome even by invoking line opacities , as line driven winds are viable only for objects that radiate close to the eddington luminosity limit @xcite whereas ngc 3998 radiates at substantially below that limit , by a factor of 4 @xmath7 10@xmath17 .",
    "a vlbi observation has revealed a jet - like structure on the northern side of the nucleus of ngc 3998 @xcite , but this is an unlikely source for the observed broad balmer line emission as that outflow consists of a relativistic plasma that is ejected essentially perpendicular to the line of sight and perpendicular to the @xmath22 slit orientation .",
    "gas entrained by such jets would produce a narrow line centered at the systemic redshift which is contrary to the broad emission line that is observed .",
    "a steady state spherical inflow is able to reproduce the broad balmer emission line profiles observed for ngc 3998 and with the minimum of assumptions .    the relationship between velocity and radius is determined by the mass distribution , _",

    "5 , a broad line profile , @xmath52 , with the characteristics of the one observed in ngc 3998 may be produced by generating a histogram of observed velocities @xmath53 for a system of particles indexed by @xmath54 and distributed randomly within a spherical volume @xmath55    here @xmath56 denotes the observed velocity of the @xmath57 particle .",
    "implicit in this model is the assumption that the particles share the same emissivity and emit isotropically .    for",
    "a steady state flow the particle number density distribution is determined by mass conservation to be    @xmath58    the distribution is used to produce a broad line profile by creating a series of concentric spherical shells @xmath59 of radii @xmath60 selected randomly between @xmath61 and @xmath62 . on each shell , @xmath59 a total of @xmath63 particles is distributed randomly in position , ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the model differs from bondi flow @xcite in that the particles are discrete and do not constitute a fluid .",
    "approximately 12,000 particles are included in the model .",
    "the velocity histogram is binned by 25 km / s and subsequently smoothed using a 10 bin moving average .",
    "the resulting model velocity resolution is comparable to that of the g430l spectra but considerably lower than the g750 m spectra .",
    "the details of the resulting line profile shape are sensitive to the range of values employed for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "for example , restricting the range of @xmath65 such that -0.96@xmath49/2  @xmath67/2 simulates the cavity expected to be occupied by the radio jets and causes the model profile to more closely mimic the observed profile in the region near the peak . in the inflow model , the velocity width at the top of the line is determined by the outer radius , @xmath68 , and the width at zero intensity is determined by the inner radius , @xmath69 , and these values are largely _ insensitive _ to the range of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "thus , given a density distribution and a velocity law , one can use the profile shape to determine the physical size of the emitting region .",
    "values that produce a reasonable representation of the broad balmer emission line profiles , shown in figure 5 , correspond to an outer radius , @xmath68 = 7 pc , and an inner radius , @xmath69 = 0.08 pc .",
    "the model is illustrative and does not represent a unique solution or the result of a full exploration of the parameter space .",
    "however , experience indicates that the model values determined for the inner and outer radius would have to change substantially , by more than @xmath4 30% , to cause the model to seriously misrepresent the observed profile .",
    "5 illustrates that the residuals between the observed profiles and the model prediction are @xmath4 10% .",
    "next , the kinematics of a rotating axisymmetric keplerian disk are considered as an explanation for the shape of the broad balmer emission line profiles .",
    "while there has been a novel proposal @xcite to generate a single peak profile using a disk wind , it is not adopted here because the agn in ngc 3998 radiates at 4 @xmath7 10@xmath17 of the eddington luminosity limit . therefore ,",
    "if an accretion disk wind is present it is expected to be feeble and not influence the propagation of balmer line photons ( see section 3.1 and the discussion of arp  102b by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead",
    ", the simplest possible model is considered which involves an axisymmetric , relativistic accretion disk developed by @xcite , and adopted later by @xcite to explain the single peak broad line profile in the liner nucleus ngc 3065 .",
    "in addition to doppler shifts , this model includes self - consistently all relevant relativistic effects , such as doppler boosting and transverse and gravitational redshifts .",
    "the axisymmetric disk model invokes five free parameters , a dimensionless inner radius , @xmath70 , and outer radius , @xmath71 , an inclination angle measured from the disk normal to the line of sight , @xmath54 , an emissivity law of the form @xmath72 , and a velocity dispersion for the gas , @xmath73 in km / s .",

    "evidently , both a spherically symmetric inflow and an accretion disk are able to reproduce the shape of the broad balmer emission line profiles observed for ngc 3998 .",

    "indeed , the distinction between the broad permitted lines and the much narrower forbidden lines has motivated the notion that the former are produced by gas that has a density exceeding the critical density of the forbidden lines and arises from a kinematically and physically distinct gas component identified with an accretion disk .",
    "ngc 3998 is different .",
    "the balmer and forbidden line widths are similar suggesting that they have a common origin .",
    "the question is do the broad emission lines originate in an accretion disk or in an inflow ?",
    "the answer to this question may lie in the covering factor , explored in more detail in the next section .",

    "the number of ionizing photons required to excite the h@xmath1 line , estimated using eqn .",

    "if the broad h@xmath1 emission line flux is corrected for a@xmath89 = 0.3 mag of extinction @xcite then the number of ionizing photons required to excite the h@xmath1 line exceeds that available from the agn by 28% causing ngc 3998 to join m81 as an example of an agn with a belr @xmath90 @xcite .    that the central agn produces 7.6 x @xmath78 ionizing ph / s , integrated between 13.6 ev and 100 kev , is a factor of 3 lower than an independent estimate of the ionizing photon rate by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is due to different assumptions concerning the spectral energy distribution in the far - uv which is complicated by the fact that the nucleus of ngc 3998 is time variable .",

    "hst _ in the f250w filter was 1.8 x @xmath92 erg @xmath93 s@xmath87 @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the ionizing photon rate estimated by @xcite includes the high value measured by @xcite and the higher value for the 2120  flux favored by @xcite whereas the new estimate presented here does not . as such , the rate n@xmath96 = 7.8 x @xmath78 ionizing",
    "ph / s , represents the ionizing photon rate in the central 0.2@xmath14 of ngc 3998 , _ circa _ 2002 . if , on the other hand , the spectral energy distribution is represented by a quasar @xcite , then n@xmath96 increases to 3.5 x @xmath97 ionizing ph / s , which alleviates the ionizing deficit , but still implies a high covering factor corresponding to @xmath98 20% .",
    "the high covering factor @xmath99 20% is much easier to achieve with a spherical distribution of gas than a thin accretion disk and is the main argument that the broad emission lines seen in ngc 3998 are due to an inflow , an outflow being impossible for the reasons explained in section 3.1 .",
    "the possibility of inflows has received remarkably little attention in the literature as noted recently by @xcite .",
    "indeed , there has been nary a mention of inflows in the context of broad line profile shapes since @xcite . yet this",
    "most neglected of models is able to explain the broad balmer emission lines seen in ngc 3998 and another low luminosity agn , m81 , as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "another contending explanation for the broad emission lines seen in ngc 3998 is that they result from the ionization of the extended mass loss envelopes of red giant stars orbiting close to the agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar winds provide a natural explanation for the confinement and replenishment of the so called @xmath100broad line clouds@xmath100 , which is otherwise a major problem @xcite .",
    "such a model may explain the in ngc 3998 , because the intensity of ionizing photons in the belr at a distance , @xmath101 @xmath4 5 pc , from the agn is sufficient to penetrate the mass loss wind to a density @xmath4 @xmath102 @xmath9 which is comparable to that inferred for the belr from the [ s ii ] lines ( section 4.5 ) .",
    "following @xcite , it can be shown that for a power law of spectral index @xmath1 = 1 , the density , @xmath103 , in the wind at the penetration depth , @xmath104 , of the ionizing photons is given by ,    @xmath105^{2/3 } [ r/10^{15 } cm]^{-4/3 } [ v_w/10~km / s]^{1/3 } [ \\dot{m}/ 10^{-5 } m_{\\sun}/yr]^{-1/3 }   cm^{-3}\\ ] ]    representative values for ngc 3998 are @xmath39 = 5 pc , @xmath106 = 1.6 @xmath7 10@xmath107 l@xmath108 , @xmath109 = 10 km / s for the wind velocity , and @xmath110 = 10@xmath111 m@xmath11/yr @xcite and @xmath110 = 10@xmath112 m@xmath11/yr for the stellar mass loss rates @xcite .",
    "one finds that @xmath113 is 7.8 x @xmath114 @xmath9 and 1.7 x @xmath102 @xmath9 respectively , values that are comparable to the gas densities inferred for the belr from the [ s ii ] lines discussed further in section 4.5 .",
    "@xcite have explored the so called @xmath100bloated stars @xmath100 ( bss ) model in some detail although not for the specific characteristics of the agn / bel combination in ngc 3998 . such an investigation may be worth revisiting , however , as the properties of the gas in ngc 3998 may be explained in the context of a low density , optically thin , stellar mass loss wind which would allow the production of broad forbidden emission lines with velocity widths similar to the balmer lines .",
    "previously , @xcite were restricted to models that suppressed the formation of broad forbidden lines by invoking stellar mass loss winds of unrealistically high density , but it appears that the density restriction can now be lifted , at least in the case of ngc 3998 .",
    "another attractive feature of the bss model is that it can potentially achieve the high covering factor needed to explain the near equality between the ionization provided by the agn and that required by the broad balmer lines .",
    "stellar mass loss is also the most likely origin for the inflowing gas invoked to explain the broad balmer line profiles .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result to have emerged from the analysis of the broad balmer emission line profiles is the large outer radius , @xmath4 7 pc , inferred for belr of ngc 3998 corresponding to an angular diameter of 0.2@xmath14 .",
    "an independent analysis of the angular size based on the encircled energy , illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , shows that the belr of ngc 3998 is spatially unresolved with the 0.1@xmath14 wide slit employed for the @xmath23 g750 m observations .",
    "this is because the percentage of the broad line flux measured in 1 pixel wide and 2 pixel wide extractions , as compared with the flux measured in a 7 pixel wide extraction , is consistent with that expected for a point source .",
    "additionally , there is no perceptible difference between the h@xmath1 profile obtained with a 0.1@xmath14 slit and the h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 profiles which were obtained with a 0.2@xmath14 slit .",
    "however , no large difference is expected based on the modeling .",
    "even if the ` poles ' of the model spherical inflow are excluded , as would be the case when the slit width is 0.1@xmath14 and slightly smaller than the 0.2@xmath14 diameter of the inflow , the model line profile shape remains unchanged .",
    "this is because only a few points are excluded from the model .",
    "additional evidence that the belr is unresolved is that the balmer line profiles are similar even though the observations were made with a variety of slit orientations that differed by as much as @xmath4 25 degrees in position angle .",
    "the size inferred for the belr causes ngc 3998 to not conform to the correlation between blr size and uv luminosity established for quasars and high luminosity agns using reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the correlation appears to break down for low luminosity agns , which , with l(1450 @xmath115 ) = 6.3 @xmath7 10@xmath116 erg / s , estimated from the g140l spectrum , would include ngc 3998 , even allowing for the variability which is discussed in more detail in section 4.1 .",
    "nevertheless , an extrapolation of the blr size - luminosity relationship of @xcite down to the low uv luminosity estimated for the agn in ngc 3998 , predicts a size for the blr that is about 200 times smaller than the inner radius of the belr determined for ngc 3998 by profile fitting .",
    "conversely , the large outer radius determined for the belr of ngc 3998 using profile fitting makes it larger than any blr measured using reverberation mapping , 24 times larger than the previous record holder ; the quasar 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "even though ngc 3998 is known to be variable in the uv @xcite , no variability has been detected in the balmer lines on a timescale of 4.4 years precluding an estimate of its reverberation based blr size .",
    "of course , the blr size - luminosity relationship of @xcite is defined by quasars and agns that are orders of magnitude more luminous than ngc 3998 .",
    "thus , the very large discrepancy arising from the comparison strongly suggests that the belr in ngc 3998 is not simply the blr of a scaled down quasar .      estimating the mass of the bh in ngc 3998 using the so called ` virial method ' leads to a value that is substantially lower than the kinematically determined mass .",
    "for example , the formalism of @xcite , which uses the fwhm _ and _ luminosity of the broad h@xmath1 emission line , underestimates the mass of the bh in ngc 3998 by a factor of 413 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bh in ngc 3998 does conform to the bh mass - bulge mass correlation as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "this dichotomy is regarded as further evidence that the belr in ngc 3998 is very different from the blr in more luminous agns .",
    "the fact that the two [ s ii ] lines are nearly as broad as the balmer lines provides an opportunity to set a lower limit on the gas density in the belr . the nominal value for the observed [ s ii ] @xmath186742/@xmath186754 intensity ratio = 0.58 @xmath31 0.24 , corresponding to @xmath117 @xmath4 7 @xmath7 10@xmath118 @xmath119 , but the large uncertainty permits gas densities in the range 10@xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath5 @xmath117 @xmath5 10@xmath81 @xmath119 .",
    "these densities are much lower than the 10@xmath120 @xmath119 often quoted for the blrs of more luminous agns . however , the fact that the balmer lines are wider than either of the [ s ii ] lines may suggest that the gas density is higher than 7 @xmath710@xmath118 @xmath119 in the region emitting the balmer lines if the gas density increases closer to the bh .    the limit for the observed [ o iii ] ratio ( @xmath184960.30 + @xmath185008.24 ) / @xmath184364.44 @xmath121 24 yields t @xmath122 28,800 k for the electron temperature if @xmath117 = 7 @xmath710@xmath118 @xmath119 , which is judged to be representative of the temperature in the belr because the vacuum wavelength [ o iii ] @xmath184960.30 and @xmath185008.24 lines @xmath123 observed to be as broad as the balmer lines .",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath124 , given by    @xmath125    corresponds to 0.006 @xmath5 @xmath124 @xmath5 48 for gas in the belr with 7 @xmath6 @xmath39(pc ) @xmath6 0.08 pc and ionized by the central agn .",
    "such values for the ionization parameter are similar to those expected inside an hii region ionized by an o5 star .",
    "that is not to say that the ionization in ngc 3998 is provided by o5 stars , but rather that the electron temperature is expected to be similar and consistent with the limit @xmath122 28,800 k determined from the [ o iii ] ratio ( @xmath184960.30 + @xmath185008.24 ) / @xmath184364.44 .",
    "the mass of emitting gas may be deduced from the broad h@xmath1 emission line luminosity assuming standard ( case b ) recombination theory ;    @xmath126    using an effective recombination coefficient @xmath84 = 8.6 x 10@xmath127 @xmath86 s@xmath87 , assuming a _ constant _ average density @xmath117 @xmath6 7 @xmath710@xmath118 @xmath119 , and a luminosity @xmath128 ) = 2.6 x 10@xmath33 l@xmath11 based on the broad line flux reported in table l , leads to an upper limit on the mass of ionized gas emitting the broad h@xmath129 line , @xmath130 @xmath5 4600 m@xmath11 .",
    "if only a fraction of the gas is ionized then the upper limit on the _ total _",
    "( ionized + neutral ) gas mass could , of course , be much higher .",
    "thus , the total mass of gas in the belr of ngc 3998 could be substantial .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the filling factor , @xmath131 , for a spherically symmetric inflow , once the dimensions of the emitting region have been established . for a uniform density medium occupying a spherical volume of radius @xmath39",
    ", one finds    @xmath132    again , using an effective recombination coefficient @xmath84 = 8.6 x 10@xmath127 @xmath86 s@xmath87 , assuming a _ constant _ average gas density @xmath117 @xmath6 7 @xmath710@xmath118 @xmath119 , and a luminosity @xmath128 ) = 2.6 x 10@xmath33 l@xmath11 based on the broad line flux reported in table 1 , leads to an upper limit on the filling factor , @xmath133 @xmath5 2 x 10@xmath10 , for ngc 3998 if the size of the belr , @xmath39 = 7 pc .",
    "the very low filling factor suggests that the inflow is not continuous but composed of many ionized , density bounded , gas filaments .",
    "such filaments would have approximately the same gas density and hence the same emissivity regardless of their location with respect to the central agn , they would be optically thin and hence emit isotropically",
    ". ionized gas filaments embrace all the essential elements of the inflow model and are commonly seen in the nuclei of active galaxies @xcite .",
    "having established the dimensions of the emitting region and the filling factor one can calculate the mass inflow rate , @xmath134 , for the ionized gas , using the equation of continuity ;    @xmath135    the velocity at the inner radius of 1 pc is determined by the mass distribution to be 1550 km / s . setting the gas density in the flow , @xmath103 @xmath6 7 @xmath710@xmath118 @xmath119 , one obtains an upper limit to the mass inflow rate , @xmath136 @xmath5 6.5 @xmath7 10@xmath10 m@xmath11/yr .",
    "however , if only a fraction of the inflowing gas is ionized , then the upper limit on the _ total _ mass inflow rate could , of course , be higher .",
    "the 210 kev x - ray luminosity adopted for the agn in ngc 3998 , @xmath137 , is @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "assuming this is powered by radiatively inefficient accretion leads to the following formula @xcite    @xmath139    where @xmath38@xmath140 is in @xmath141 and @xmath37@xmath142 is in solar masses . under these circumstances the accretion rate required to power the observed x - ray emission , @xmath143 @xmath144",
    "a new technique has yielded a size for the belr in ngc 3998 by modeling the shape of the broad h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 emission line profiles .",
    "the principal conclusion is that the belr is large , @xmath4 14 pc in diameter , and represents an inflow , likely sustained by stellar mass loss .",
    "the large size determined for the belr in ngc 3998 is inconsistent with an extrapolation of the reverberation based blr size - luminosity relationship .",
    "additionally , the virial method for estimating bh masses using the broad h@xmath1 emission line width and luminosity lead to an inconsistent bh mass for ngc 3998 .",
    "both of these relationships are defined by the broad emission lines of quasars and high luminosity agns .",
    "it is therefore concluded that the belr in ngc 3998 is not the blr of a scaled down quasar but more likely identified with the narrow line region .",
    "the agn is able to sustain the ionization of the belr , albeit with a high covering factor ranging between 20% and 100% depending on the adopted spectral energy distribution .",
    "such a high covering factor is most easily provided by a spherical distribution of gas as opposed to a thin disk .",
    "the electron temperature in the belr is @xmath122 28,000 k consistent with photoionization by the agn .",
    "the gas density is pivotal in constraining the mass of gas in the belr .",
    "if the gas density is high , @xmath6 7 @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath9 , then interpreting the broad h@xmath1 emission line in terms of a steady state spherically symmetric inflow leads to a rate @xmath5 6.5 @xmath7 10@xmath10 m@xmath11/yr which exceeds the requirement to explain the x - ray luminosity in terms of a radiatively inefficient inflow by a factor of @xmath518 .",
