    "<S> numerical simulations show that laser cooling of fermions on the repulsive side of the feshbach resonance can sympathetically cool molecules well below their condensation temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 03.75.ss , 39.25.+k , 03.75-b fermi superfluids are in the center of interest of recent studies in physics of ultracold quantum gases . </S>",
    "<S> they provide perhaps the most promising model system to study the superfluidity , and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory in the limit of strong interactions , when the size of cooper pairs becomes comparable or even smaller than average interparticle distance , and the mean field description breaks down @xcite . in cold atom systems </S>",
    "<S> the use of feshbach resonances permits to tune the @xmath0-wave scattering length between the atoms with opposite `` spin '' @xcite , assuring in this way a high flexibility of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> this technique allows in particular to drive the system through the bcs - bec crossover when the scattering length diverges and changes sign from negative ( attractive ) to positive ( repulsive ) . during this passage </S>",
    "<S> , the state of the system continuously evolves from the bcs superfluid of weakly correlated cooper pairs , through the pseudogap regime , and then the unitarity limit , when the scattering length diverges , to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of diatomic molecules . by now several successful experiments with molecular condensates </S>",
    "<S> were performed @xcite which opened a way to first successful experiments with fermi superfluids @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier theoretical studies demonstrated that laser cooling allows to reach the degeneracy in fermi systems @xcite , and to go all the way down to the fermi superfluid @xcite on the attractive side of the feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this communication is to show that laser cooling offers also an alternative technique to reach molecular condensate on the repulsive side of the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it allows to post - cool the condensate prepared via evaporative cooling down to even lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed here a fully self - consistent quantum kinetic theory of molecular condensate creation via laser cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the results are very promising : despite the fact that condensate formation shifts the energies of quasiparticle excitations with respect to the equally spaced harmonic oscillator levels , and at the same time reduces fermionic population exposed to laser cooling , the cooling remains efficient well below the condensation temperature of @xmath1 down to at least @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> optimization of the cooling protocol could probably significantly reduce this temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider system containing two species of fermions with `` spin up and down '' , molecules which are in their bound states , and fermions in an excited state . </S>",
    "<S> we work on the repulsive side of the feshbach resonance , where interactions strengths between spin up / down fermions and molecules , as well as the binding energy of the molecules are simple universal functions of the effective @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath3 between spin up and down fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> close to the resonance the binding energy of molecules @xmath4 can be made less than the condensation temperature @xmath5 for the molecules . as a result at all temperatures greater than @xmath6 populations of molecules and fermions are comparable . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath6 , a fraction of molecules condenses leaving room in molecular phase space for more fermions to bind into molecules . </S>",
    "<S> fermionic population is then shrinking , but it remains still comparable to the shrinking population of non - condensed molecules all the way down to the dissociation temperature , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath8 , fermionic population is suppressed , but at the same time almost all molecules are already condensed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , close to the feshbach resonance , when @xmath9 , there are favorable conditions for efficient sympathetic cooling of molecules by collisions with spin up / down fermions at all temperatures of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the fermions in turn are subject to laser cooling , and provide the heat reservoir , which is comparable to the cooled system ( non - condensed molecules ) . </S>",
    "<S> populations of the spin up and down fermions are the same . </S>",
    "<S> mutual @xmath0-wave interactions between these two populations and the population of molecules lead to thermalization on a time scale , which is faster than the rate of laser cooling . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> three - body collisions keep the system close to chemical equilibrium between molecules and fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the system remains thus in a state of quasi - equilibrium with slowly decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this thermal state is described by the generalized bcs theory or boson - fermion model @xcite which includes bec of molecules described by the gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> the model takes into account coherent tunneling between molecules and pairs of spin up and down fermions . </S>",
    "<S> thermal excitations of the molecular condensate are described by the bosonic bogoliubov theory . </S>",
    "<S> structure of the ground state of fermions and its fermionic excitations follows from the set of bogoliubov - de gennes equations together with self - consistent definitions of the gap function and the mean field potential . on the repulsive side of the feshbach resonance the leading contribution to </S>",
    "<S> the gap function comes from the molecular bec through the coherent coupling between molecules and pairs of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the gap function experienced by fermions is proportional to the condensate wave function . </S>",
    "<S> laser cooling of fermions was described in detail in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coherent laser excites atoms from , say , the spin down ground state to the excited state , and spontaneous emission brings them back to the spin down ground state . </S>",
    "<S> frequencies of the laser assure that the generalized raman cooling takes place @xcite . in this communication </S>",

    "<S> calculation of the transition rates is the most time consuming part of the numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this is why we were forced to assume spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> for spherically symmetric @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 the bogoliubov modes are @xmath79 and their energies @xmath80 do not depend on @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> in other words , we assume fast equilibration within each quasiparticle energy shell which keeps the system in a spherically symmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> more on spherical symmetry in appendix b.    in our simulations we use 81 harmonic oscillator levels , and assume that there are @xmath83 atoms with spin up and down which in the non - interacting case at @xmath84 is equivalent to 39 filled energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the isotropic trap is @xmath85hz , the same for all fermions and molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering length for the interaction between the two species is @xmath86 , a realistic value for interactions between two spin states @xmath87 and @xmath88 of @xmath89k near the feshbach resonance . in the natural harmonic oscillator units this scattering length gives the interaction strength @xmath90 , and the molecular binding energy @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength of the cooling laser is @xmath92 nm , and the laser detuning is @xmath93 . in all simulations the frequency of rabi oscillations is much less than the spontaneous emission rate , @xmath94 , so that the average occupation of excited state remains small . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> we neglect @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of the mean field potential is an overall shift of energy levels which can be compensated by laser detuning @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent tunneling rate in trap units is @xmath95 .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t_t ] we show temperature as a function of time for laser cooling with two values of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly as on the bcs side of the feshbach resonance the nonzero gap function @xmath76 induced by the molecular bec does not affect much the efficiency of laser cooling . moreover , the cooling remains efficient even below the dissociation temperature of @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not quite surprising because even at such low temperature there is a non - zero fraction of fermions induced by coherent tunneling from the molecular bec , which can be cooled by the laser . </S>",
    "<S> the initial cooling is faster for @xmath97 but the final temperature of @xmath2 is lower for @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the best strategy to reach low temperatures in reasonable time is to do the cooling in a few stages starting with large @xmath45 and finishing with small @xmath45 , as shown in the inset in fig.[t_t ] . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ delta_t ] we show the growth of the molecular condensate in the same simulations as in fig.[t_t ] .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that for reasonable experimental parameters consistent with the requirements of the festina lente regime , it is possible to laser cool fermions on the positive side of the feshbach resonance all the way down to the molecular bec . despite the pairing effects , which produce a gap in the quasiparticle energy spectrum and the heat capacity of non - condensed molecules , it is possible to reach at least @xmath99 in a time of a few seconds .    </S>",
