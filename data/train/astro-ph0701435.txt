    "large - scale hi  is detected in a growing number of early - type galaxies . in these proceedings",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the majority of the known cases ,",
    "the hi  is distributed in regular rotating disk- or ring - like structures , that can reach far beyond the optical host galaxy and have hi  masses up to a few times the hi  mass of the milky way . however",
    ", this could be an observational bias , given that irregular structures are more frequently observed if one has the sensitivity to trace low mass hi  structures of only a few million solar masses @xcite .",
    "two good explanations for the origin of large - scale hi  structures in early - type galaxies are gas - rich galaxy mergers and the cold accretion of circum - galactic gas .",
    "+   + in case of a major merger between gas - rich galaxies , part of the gas is transported to the central region of the merging system , where a sudden burst of star formation is triggered @xcite .",
    "another part of the gas is expelled in large - scale tidal features of low surface - brightness , which can reach far beyond the optical host galaxy .",
    "if the environment is not too hostile and the gas in the tails remains gravitationally bound to the system , it can fall back onto the galaxy and settle into a disk- or ring - like structure within a few galactic orbits ( @xmath31 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the meanwhile , the stars in the merging systems have rearranged into an early - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "+   + in case of cold accretion , galaxies accrete gas from the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) via a cold mode , i.e. part of the gas cools along filamentary structures without being shock - heated @xcite .",
    "this gas ( with @xmath4 ) may cool further to form the large - scale structures of neutral hydrogen . on smaller scales ,",
    "@xcite show that through the cooling of hot halo gas , cold gas can be assembled onto a galactic disc .    while both mechanisms provide a viable explanation for the formation of large - scale hi  around early - type galaxies , the exact formation mechanism is in most cases not evident from the hi  distribution alone . to verify the origin of these hi  structures",
    "it is therefore necessary to study other tracers of the formation history of the galaxy .",
    "a good tracer in this respect is the stellar population content of the galaxy .",
    "as described above , a major merger event triggers a burst of star formation in the host galaxy , which can be traced with optical spectra .",
    "we have used both hi  imaging and optical spectroscopy to study the formation history of nearby radio galaxies .",
