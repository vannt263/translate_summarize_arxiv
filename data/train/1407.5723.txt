    "bright extragalactic supernovae ( sne ) provide unparalleled opportunities to study interstellar gas in nearby galaxies through high - resolution absorption - line spectroscopy . with the advent of modern , wide - field transient surveys , which quickly identify and classify newly - occurring supernovae",
    ", such studies are becoming increasingly more common . still , the occurrence of a supernova as close as that recently discovered in m82 ( sn  2014j ; fossey et al .",
    "2014 ) , especially one that probes as much interstellar material as this object does ( e.g. , cox et al .  2014",

    "2009 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "2009 ) , sn  2014j is one of the closest sne to be discovered in recent decades .",
    "early photometric and spectroscopic analyses ( cao et al .  2014 ; zheng et al .  2014 ; goobar et al .",
    "2014 ) indicate that sn  2014j is a normal type  ia supernova , but one that is heavily reddened by intervening interstellar material in the host galaxy .",
    "estimates for the host galaxy contribution to @xmath4 vary , but most are between about 0.8 and 1.3 mag ( e.g. , welty et al .  2014 ; amanullah et al .  2014 ; foley et al .",

    "the proximity of sn  2014j makes it possible to obtain high - resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) optical spectra at multiple epochs , while the significant dust extinction means that many interstellar species are likely to be detected .",
    "such data can be used to search for weak interstellar features rarely seen in extragalactic sight lines and to look for temporal changes in the absorption profiles that might signify an interaction between the supernova and possible circumstellar material associated with the progenitor system ( e.g. , patat et al .  2007 ; simon et al .",
    "2009 ) or , alternatively , could be used to probe small - scale structure in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy ( patat et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "most optical studies of interstellar lines in supernova spectra must necessarily rely on the strong na  i and ca  ii features , as these are frequently the only lines detectable at the host galaxy velocity .",
    "the na  i and ca  ii profiles are useful for examining the basic kinematics of the absorption systems , and the na  i / ca  ii column density ratio can give a rough indication of the overall physical conditions ( although there is some ambiguity between the effects of dust depletion , which mainly affects the ca  ii abundance , and ionization , which can influence the amount of na  i and ca  ii present ) . however , in situations where additional interstellar species are detectable , such as k  i , ca  i , ch@xmath2 , ch , and cn , a more complete picture of the host galaxy ism can be constructed .",
    "while such detections are rare , there have been a few sn absorption - line studies where these additional species were observed .",

    "a portion of the combined spectrum in the vicinity of the li  i line is shown in the upper panel of figure  4 .",

    "<S> we examine complex absorption from na  i , ca  ii , k  i , ca  i , ch@xmath2 , ch , and cn , arising primarily from diffuse gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of m82 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect li  i absorption over a range in velocity consistent with that exhibited by the strongest na  i and k  i components associated with m82 ; this is the first detection of interstellar li in a galaxy outside of the local group . </S>",
    "<S> there are no significant temporal variations in the absorption - line profiles over the 37 days sampled by our observations . </S>",
    "<S> the relative abundances of the various interstellar species detected reveal that the ism of m82 probed by sn  2014j consists of a mixture of diffuse atomic and molecular clouds characterized by a wide range of physical / environmental conditions . decreasing @xmath3(na  </S>",
    "<S> i)/@xmath3(ca  ii ) ratios and increasing @xmath3(ca  i)/@xmath3(k  i ) ratios with increasing velocity are indicative of reduced depletion in the higher - velocity material . </S>",
    "<S> significant component - to - component scatter in the @xmath3(na  i)/@xmath3(ca  ii ) and @xmath3(ca  i)/@xmath3(ca  ii ) ratios may be due to variations in the local ionization conditions . </S>",
    "<S> an apparent anti - correlation between the @xmath3(ch@xmath2)/@xmath3(ch ) and @xmath3(ca  i)/@xmath3(ca  ii ) ratios can be understood in terms of an opposite dependence on gas density and radiation field strength , while the overall high ch@xmath2 abundance may be indicative of enhanced turbulence in the ism of m82 . </S>",
    "<S> the li abundance also seems to be enhanced in m82 , which supports the conclusions of recent gamma - ray emission studies that the cosmic - ray acceleration processes are greatly enhanced in this starburst galaxy . </S>"
