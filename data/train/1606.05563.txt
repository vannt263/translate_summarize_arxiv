    "there is one pretropism @xmath2 , which defines the initial forms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively as @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for traditional puiseux series",

    "our object of study is space curves , by which we mean 1-dimensional varieties in @xmath13 . because puiseux series computations take one variable to be a free variable , we require that the curves not lie inside @xmath14 for some @xmath15 ; without loss of generality we choose to use the first variable .",
    "some results require that the curve be in noether position with respect to @xmath16 , meaning that the degree of the variety is preserved under intersection with @xmath17 for a generic @xmath18 .",
    "it is of course possible to apply a random coordinate transformation to obtain noether position , but we then lose the sparsity of the system s exponent support structure , which is what makes polyhedral methods effective .",
    "in this section we illustrate the problem our paper addresses with some simple examples , first in 3-space , and then with a family of space curves in any dimensional space .",
    "our first running example is the system @xmath19 which has an irreducible quartic and the second coordinate axis @xmath20 as its solutions . because the line lies in the first coordinate plane @xmath21 ,",
    "the system is not in noether position with respect to the first variable .",

    "the algorithms of  @xcite can be applied to compute components inside coordinate planes . computing a primary decomposition yields the following alternative , which lacks the portion in the first coordinate plane : @xmath22    the tropical prevariety contains the rays @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and  @xmath25 ; because our puiseux series start their development at @xmath26 , rays that have a zero or negative value for their first coordinate have been discarded .",

    ", it is possible for the 1-dimensional cones of the tropical prevariety to fail to be in the tropical variety , and for rays in the tropical variety to `` hide '' in the higher - dimensional cones of the prevariety .",
    "this problem can also occur in arbitrary dimensions , as seen in the class of examples @xmath28 the ray @xmath29 is a 1-dimensional cone of its prevariety since it is normal to a facet of each polytope , namely the linear portion of each polynomial .",
    "it is not , however , in the tropical variety , since the initial form system ( as it will be defined in section  [ genericcase ] ) contains the monomial @xmath16 .",

    "it is important to note that our notion of generic here refers to the coefficients , and not to generic tropical varieties as seen in @xcite which are tropical varieties of ideals under a generic linear transformation of coordinates .",
    "the tropical prevariety always contains the tropical variety .",

    "suppose @xmath51 contains no monomial .",

    "we illustrate the application of polyhedral methods to the motivating examples .    as a verification on the first motivating example  ( [ eqmotivex ] ) , we consider the rays @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and  @xmath25 of its tropical prevariety .",

    "is the first coordinate of @xmath23 , this ray contributes two branches and adds two to the degree of the solution curve .",
    "the other rays @xmath24 and @xmath25 each contribute one to the degree , and",
    "so we recover the degree four of the solution curve .    for the family of systems in  ( [ eqgenexample ] ) , consider the curve in 4-space : @xmath112 for the tropism @xmath113 , the initial form is @xmath114 this tropism is in the interior of the cone in the tropical prevariety spanned by @xmath115 and @xmath116 . using the same techniques as in the previous example , we find @xmath117 has a mixed volume of one and @xmath118 has a mixed volume of three , so for generic coefficients we again recover the degree of the solution curve .",
    "in @xcite a method is given for computing the tropical variety of an ideal @xmath36 defining a curve .",
    "it involves appending witness polynomials from @xmath36 to a list of its generators such that for this new set , the tropical prevariety equals the tropical variety .",
    "such a set is called a _ tropical basis_. each additional polynomial rules out one of the cones in the original prevariety that does not belong in the tropical variety . as stated in @xcite only finitely",
    "many additional polynomials are necessary , since the prevariety has only finitely many cones .",
    "the algorithm runs as follows . for each cone",
    "@xmath119 in the tropical prevariety , we choose a generic element @xmath120 .",
    "we check whether in@xmath121 contains a monomial by saturating with respect to @xmath122 , the product of ring variables ; the initial ideal contains a monomial if and only if this saturation ideal is equal to @xmath123 .",
    "if in@xmath121 does not contain a monomial , the cone @xmath119 belongs in our tropical variety .",
    "if it does , we check whether @xmath124 for increasing values of @xmath15 until we find a monomial @xmath125 .",
    "finally , we append @xmath126 to our list of basis elements , where @xmath127 is the reduction of @xmath122 with respect to a grbner basis of @xmath36 under any monomial order that refines @xmath128 . for @xmath128 to define a global monomial order , and thus allow a grbner basis , it may be necessary to homogenize the ideal first .    bounding the complexity of this algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper , but for each cone it requires computing a grbner basis of @xmath36 as well as another ( possibly faster ) basis when calculating the saturation to check if the initial ideal contains a monomial .",
    "in some cases we may only be concerned about tropisms hiding in a particular higher - dimensional cone of the prevariety , such as with our running example ( [ eqgenexample ] ) . here",
    "it is reasonable to perform only one step of this algorithm , namely looking for a witness for a single cone , which could be significantly faster .",
    "however , this has the disadvantage of introducing more 1-dimensional cones into the prevariety .",
    "more details , including some timing comparisons , will be given in section  [ compexp ] .",
    "a polyhedral end game  @xcite applies extrapolation methods to numerically estimate the winding number of solution paths defined by a homotopy .",
    "the leading exponents of the puiseux series are recovered via differences of the logarithms of the magnitudes of the coordinates of the solution paths . even in the case  as in our illustrative example  where the given polynomials contain insufficient information to compute all tropisms only from the prevariety , a polyhedral end game manages to compute all tropisms .",
    "the setup is similar to that of  @xcite , arising in a numerical study of the asymptotics of a space curve , defined by the system @xmath95 : @xmath129 as @xmath130 moves from 0 to 1 , the hyperplane @xmath131 moves the coordinate plane perpendicular to the first coordinate axis .    as @xmath130 moves from 0 to 1",
    ", it is important to note that @xmath130 will actually never be equal to one . in the polyhedral end games of  @xcite , to estimate the winding number via extrapolation methods , the step size decreases in a geometric ratio . in particular , denoting the winding number by @xmath132 , for @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , we consider the solutions for @xmath135 , @xmath136 , starting at some @xmath137 .    the constant @xmath138 in  ( [ eqhomotopy ] ) is a randomly generated complex number .",
    "this implies that for @xmath131 , the polynomial system in  ( [ eqhomotopy ] ) for @xmath139 has as many isolated solutions ( generic points on the space , eventually counted with multiplicities ) as the degree of the projection of the space curve onto the first coordinate plane .",
    "as long as @xmath140 , the points remain generic , although the numerical condition numbers are expected to blow up as @xmath130 approaches one .",
    "the deteriorating numerical ill conditioning can be mitigated by the use of multiprecision arithmetic .",
    "for example , condition numbers larger than @xmath141 make results unreliable in double precision . in double double precision , much higher condition numbers can be tolerated , typically up to  @xmath142 , and this goes up to  @xmath143 for quad double precision . as we interpret the inverse of the condition number as the distance to a singular solution , with multiprecision arithmetic we can compute more points more accurately as needed in the extrapolation to estimate winding numbers .",
    "an additional difficulty arises when a path diverges to infinity , which manifests itself by a tropism with negative coordinates .",
    "a reformation of the problem in a weighted projective space corresponds to a unimodular coordinate transformation which uses the computed direction of the solution path . towards the end of the path ,",
    "this direction coincides with the tropism .",
    "the a posteriori verification of a polyhedral end game is similar to computing a puiseux expansion starting at a pretropism .",
    "in this section we focus on the family of systems  ( [ eqgenexample ] ) with a tropism hidden in a higher dimensional cone of pretropisms .",
    "classical families such as the cyclic @xmath45-roots problems appear not to have such hidden pretropisms , at least not for the cases computed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "to substantiate the claim that finding the tropical variety is computationally expensive , we calculated tropical bases of the system  ( [ eqgenexample ] ) for various values of @xmath45 .",
    "the symbolic computations of tropical bases was done with gfan  @xcite .",
    "times are displayed in figure  [ tropbasistimes ] .",
    "the computations were executed on an intel xeon e5 - 2670 processor running redhat linux .",
    "as is clear from the table , as the dimension grows for this relatively simple system , computation time becomes prohibitively large .",
    "c|ccccc n & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 + time & 0.052 & 0.306 & 2.320 & 33.918 & 970.331 +    [ tropbasistimes ]    as mentioned in section  [ currentapproaches ] , an alternative to computing the tropical basis is to only calculate the witness polynomial for a particular cone of the tropical prevariety .",
    "we implemented this algorithm in macaulay2 @xcite and applied it to  ( [ eqgenexample ] ) to cut down the cone generated by the rays @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "in all the cases we tried , the new prevariety contained the ray @xmath146 , as we expected .    from table  [ cutcone ]",
    "it is clear that this has a significant speed advantage over computing a full tropical basis .",
    "however , it has the disadvantage of introducing many more rays into the prevariety",
    ". the number can vary depending on the random ray chosen in the cone , so the third column lists some of the values we obtained over several trials .",
    "we only computed up through dimension 10 because the prevariety computations were excessive for higher dimensions .",
    ".execution times in seconds of the computation of a witness polynomial for the cone generated by @xmath147 of the system  ( [ eqgenexample ] ) ; averages of 3 trials .",
    "the third column lists the number of rays in the fan obtained by intersecting the original prevariety with the normal fan of the witness polynomial ; since this can vary with the choice of random ray , we list values from several tries .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabmotivfam ]    all directions computed with double precision at an accuracy of @xmath148 .",
    "double precision sufficed to accurately compute the tropism @xmath146 .",
    "although the total number of paths grows exponentially , every path has the same direction , so tracking only one path suffices .",
    "these times are significantly smaller than the time required to compute a tropical basis .",
    "the tropical prevariety provides candidate tropisms for puiseux series expansions of space curves . as shown in  @xcite on the cyclic @xmath45-root problems",
    ", the pretropisms may directly lead to series developments for the positive dimensional solution sets . in this paper we studied cases where tropisms are in the relative interior of higher - dimensional cones of the tropical prevariety .",
    "if the tropical prevariety contains a higher dimensional cone and puiseux series expansion fails at one of the cone s generating rays , then a polyhedral end game can recover the tropisms in the interior of that higher dimensional cone of pretropisms . as our example shows",
    ", this takes drastically less time than computing the tropical variety via a tropical basis , especially as dimension grows .",
    "it is also faster than finding a witness polynomial for just that particular cone , and avoids the issue of adding rays to the tropical prevariety .",
