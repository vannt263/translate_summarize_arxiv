    "on the largest scales ( @xmath1mpc ) the universe is well described by homogeneous and isotropic expansion satisfying the friedmann equation . the global rate of the expansion at the current epoch is defined to be the hubble constant ( @xmath2 ) , the fundamental parameter of cosmology that sets the size and age of the universe .",
    "many methods have been used to measure @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , freedman 1996 ) .",
    "currently , the use of sneia as standard candles yields the smallest estimated measurement error ( riess , press and kirshner 1996 ; hamuy et al 1996 ; saha et al 1996 ) .    on small scales ( @xmath4 mpc ) , the universe is significantly inhomogeneous .",
    "because density fluctuations give rise to deviations from isotropic and homogeneous expansion ( peculiar velocities ) the expansion can not be characterized by a universal expansion rate and measurements within a small , finite region will yield a local expansion rate ( @xmath5 ) which is not identical to the global expansion rate .",
    "the difference arises from two factors : the finite physical size of the sample ( turner , cen & ostriker 1992 ; nakamura and suto 1995 ; shi , widrow and dursi 1996 ; turner 1997 ) and the limited number of objects in the sample . because of peculiar velocities",
    ", the average expansion rate in a finite volume is different from the global expansion ( cosmic variance ) .",
    "moreover , because only a small number of points within the volume are sampled the expansion rate defined by these points can deviate from the average expansion rate for the volume ( sampling variance ) .",
    "these effects are different from measurement error , which can be reduced by better measurements and/or better standard candles .",
    "cosmic and sampling variance can only be reduced by increasing the sample volume and the sampling density .    in this _ letter _ , we quantify cosmic and sampling variance for two samples of sneia and a cluster sample with tully - fisher distances . in so doing we use a suite of cobe - normalized cdm models that are consistent with the measurements of the level of inhomogeneity on scales less than about 300mpc and which should therefore provide a reasonable estimate for the variance that arises due to inhomogeneity in the universe .",
    "the deviation of the local expansion rate measured by an observer at position @xmath6 from the global hubble constant is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the measured radial peculiar velocity at @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the window function that characterizes the sample volume and sampled points within the volume ( more below ) . the quantity @xmath11 consists of two parts , the actual radial peculiar velocity and its measurement error , which is roughly the measurement error of the distance scaled by @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement error can be shrunk by improving distance measurements , but the real radial peculiar velocity is an intrinsic deviation from the hubble flow that is determined by the underlying density fluctuations .",
    "it is its contribution to @xmath12 that is irreducible .",
    "the peculiar - velocity field depends upon the underlying power spectrum of density perturbations , which in turn , depends upon the cosmological scenario .",
    "we shall investigate a number of cdm models . in linear - perturbation theory , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density fluctuation @xmath15/\\bar\\rho$ ] and",
    "@xmath16 is the fraction of critical density in matter that clusters . taking the fourier",
    "transform we find , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the variance of @xmath12 is @xmath20    for a top - hat , spherical window function , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the step function and @xmath24 is the radius of the top - hat sphere ( shi , widrow and dursi 1996 ) .",
    "since the top - hat spherical window function samples every point within the sphere , @xmath25 reflects only the cosmic variance associated with the finite volume of the spherical sample .",
    "real data sets do not sample every point in space , rather they sample a number of objects with positions @xmath26 and redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "the radial peculiar velocities of these objects are @xmath28 with uncertainties @xmath29 which are essentially the uncertainties in distances @xmath30 scaled by @xmath3 because the uncertainties in @xmath27 are relatively small .",
    "random motions due to local nonlinearities , characterized by a one - dimensional standard velocity dispersion @xmath31 , may be added to @xmath32 in quadrature .",
    "typically @xmath33 km / sec , and is therefore negligible when the sample depth is as large as @xmath34 km / sec .",
    "corrections to the linear hubble law due to deceleration can also be safely ignored for samples with @xmath35 . with these approximations",
    "it follows that ( shi 1997 ) @xmath36 , \\label{window}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 indices @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote summation over objects , and indices @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are spatial indices that run from 1 to 3 .",
    "now @xmath45 includes both cosmic variance and sampling variance .",
    "using eqs .  ( [ eq1 ] ) to ( [ tophat ] ) we have calculated the cosmic variance portion of @xmath45 with @xmath467,000 , 10,000 , 15,000 , 20,000 , 25,000 , and 30,000 km / sec ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the underlying cosmological models are a suite of cobe - normalized cdm models that are consistent with large - scale structure on scales from about 300mpc to 0.1mpc ( dodelson , gates , and turner 1996 ) .",
    "the cdm models include a model with a low value of the hubble constant , with significant tilt , with 20% light neutrinos , with additional radiation , and with a cosmological constant .",
    "in addition , we have included an open cdm model that is consistent with large - scale structure measurements and for completeness , a standard cdm model , which has excessive inhomogeneity on scales less than 300mpc .",
    "these models should serve well to span theoretical expectations for the level of inhomogeneity on the scales relevant for local variations in the hubble constant .",
    "their cosmic parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the cosmic variance of @xmath47 at @xmath48 km / sec is significant , ranging from about 2% to almost 4% . at @xmath49 km",
    "/ sec it has fallen to 1@xmath50 to 2@xmath50 , and quickly declines to below @xmath51 at @xmath52 km / sec for all models . at a depth of @xmath53 km / sec , which is reached by sneia ,",
    "the cosmic variance is only about @xmath54 .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) we have calculated @xmath45 for volumes that are sampled by a finite number of points , so that both cosmic and sampling variance are included . for definiteness",
    "we use the sneia sample of riess et al ( 1997 ) , for which @xmath55 km / sec / mpc , the sneia sample of hamuy et al ( 1996 ) , for which @xmath56 km / sec / mpc , and the tully - fisher sample of 36 clusters used for the template tully - fisher relation in the mark iii catalogue ( willick et al 1997 ) .",
    "our results are compiled in table 2 .",
    "the intrinsic variance of @xmath47 measured in the two sneia samples is around @xmath51 , far less than measurement error .",
    "although the sneia sample of riess et al ( 1997 ) is deeper and has more objects than that of hamuy et al ( 1996 ) , its effective depth is not as large because many of the sneia are nearby . due to its shallow depth",
    ", the tully - fisher cluster sample has a larger intrinsic variance , between 1.5% and 3% .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the effect of finite sampling for the sneia sample of riess et al ( 1997 ) . comparing this plot to fig .",
    "1 , it can be seen that the cosmic + sampling variance is more than twice the cosmic variance . at present",
    ", sampling variance dominates the intrinsic variance for the sneia samples .",
    "since sampling variance scales roughly as the inverse square root of the number of objects , it can be shrunk to less @xmath51 for all viable cdm models if the number of sneia is doubled .",
    "there are intrinsic and irreducible differences between the locally measured value of the hubble constant and the global value .",
    "they arise due to finite sample volume ( cosmic variance ) and finite sample size ( sampling variance ) and can of course be of either sign . cosmic variance and sampling variance can not be reduced by better measurements or better standard candles .",
    "we have calculated the theoretical expectations for a suite of cobe - normalized cdm models that are consistent with measurements of large - scale structure on the scales that give rise to the cosmic variance portion . for samples that only extend out to 7,000 km",
    "/ sec the cosmic variance alone can be close to 4% ; for samples of around 30 objects that extend out to 10,000 km / sec cosmic + sampling variance is between 2% and 4% . for samples of around 40 objects that extend out to 40,000 km",
    "/ sec the the total variance is between 0.5% and 1.5% , with the cosmic variance contribution being less than 0.25% .    as local measurements of the hubble constant",
    "become more precise , cosmic variance and sampling variance will become a larger portion of the error budget and may be important when comparing local measurements with the better than 1% determinations of the hubble constant anticipated from high - resolution maps of cbr anisotropy ( jungman et al 1996 ) .",
