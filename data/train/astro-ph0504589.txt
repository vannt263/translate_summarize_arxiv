    "since the release of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) first - year data , much work has been done to investigate the properties of whole - sky cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies with high resolution and sensitivity ( bennett _ et al . _ 2003a ; hinshaw _ et al .",

    "the currently favored @xmath5cdm model is based on the assumption of gaussian initial fluctuations generated by inflation , which result in gaussian temperature anisotropies in the cmb ( guth & pi 1982 ; hawking 1982 ; bardeen , steinhardt & turner 1983 ) .",
    "thus the test of non - gaussianity of cmb temperature anisotropies provides us an important constraint on distinguishing theories of the origin of primordial fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the issue is also fundamental for the determination of cosmological parameters in the framework of the inflation paradigm , since they can only be determined correctly from the angular power spectrum if the cmb temperature anisotropies constitute a gaussian random field ( bardeen _ et al .",

    "non - standard inflationary models and various cosmic defects could lead to non - gaussian primordial cmb fluctuations .",
    "non - gaussianity could also be introduced by secondary effects , such as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , the rees - sciama effect , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and gravitational lensing , or by measurement systematics , foreground and noise .",

    "the cmb - dominated bands ( two q - band maps at 40.7 ghz , two v - band maps at 60.8 ghz , and four w - band maps at 93.5 ghz ) are combined to give a map with the signal - to - noise ratio enhanced .",
    "all these maps with receiver noise , as well as beam properties , are available from the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) web site .",
    "these maps are provided in the healpix ( grski _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) format at a resolution of @xmath51 .",

    "the surface of the sphere is redivided by the equiangular spherical grid , and then the data are projected into the grid according to their position and recombined within each grid to give a weighted average in the new pixelisation .",
    "note that pixels in the new representation do not have equal areas , but this is suitable for the inverse fswt , where matrix manipulation is used for the fast fourier algorithm , greatly saving the computation time .",
    "any concern that the transformation can somehow introduce some non - gaussian features can be alleviated , since the simulation has been done in the same pipeline .",
    "the transformed data are of the size @xmath54 pixels at a loss of resolution that does not matter in this analysis , since very small scales are dominated by the noise .    at a given position @xmath55 of the sky ,",
    "the thermodynamic temperature is given by @xmath56 where the indices @xmath57 and @xmath58 refer to the q - band receivers , @xmath59 and @xmath60 to the ones of the v - band and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the receivers of the w - band ( the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 are used for the k and ka receivers , respectively , which are excluded from the analysis . ) the noise weight @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the standard deviation of the receiver noise and @xmath70 is the number of observations made by the receiver @xmath33 at position @xmath55 on the sky ( bennett _ et al . _",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : combination ] ) and ( [ eq : noise ] ) , the beams for each of the wmap channels are different and the noise variances differ from each other , which may potentially create spatially varying beams on the sky .",
    "however , these effects are subdominant to the scales of interest in this paper and can be calibrated out by separate simulations of each band .",
    "although the maps at selected frequencies are dominated by cmb , galactic foregrounds ( i.e. , thermal dust , free - free and synchrotron radiations ) , as well as extragalactic point sources all contribute significantly to the map .",
    "the wmap team performed a foreground template fit to avoid the galactic emissions ( bennett _ et al . _",
    "2003b ) : the 94 ghz dust map of finkbeiner _",
    "( 1999 ) is used as the thermal dust template , the @xmath71 map of finkbeiner ( 2003 ) corrected for extinction through the @xmath72 map of schlegel _ et al . _",

    "foreground - cleaned maps used in this analysis are available from the lambda web site .",
    "an independent foreground analysis of the _ wmap _ first - year data was performed by tegmark _",
    "the tegmark cleaned map is constructed from a linear combination of different band maps with the weights varying over both position and scale .",
    "we also perform the analysis on this map in both wavelet and real spaces .",
    "strong emissions at the galactic plane and known radio point sources could contaminate any intrinsic features so they should be excluded from the map .",
    "here we adopt the most conservative mask called  kp0 \" , which retains 76.8% of the sky .",
    "this exclusion may introduce edge effect to the map caused by the zero value of the mask .",
    "generally there are two ways to solve this edge problem .",
    "one is to exclude the data near the edges , which has been adopted recently ( mukherjee & wang 2004 ; vielva _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; mcewen _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , although any meaningful cmb features near the edge could have been smeared out . here",
    "we take another approach by filling gaussian noise in the excluded areas instead of the zero value in order that they do not contribute to deviation from gaussianity .",
    "pixel noise can be evaluated from @xmath75 via @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the standard deviation of the receiver noise of assembly @xmath33 . due to the good localization nature of wavelet in both scale and position spaces ,",
    "we assume that they will not introduce significant correlation to signals in other areas either , which have been tested from the filtering maps such that the filtered cold and hot spots are not caused by particular masks and there is no correlation between these spots and the point sources .",
    "note that the non - gaussian detection is quite insensitive to the particular choice of the exclusion masks ( mukherjee & wang , 2004 ; vielva _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; mcewen _ et al .",
    "this approach should not introduce non - gaussian signals , especially at the scales we are interested in this work . the final preprocessed q - v - w - combined wmap team map and the tegmark cleaned map",
    "are shown in fig",
    ".  1 .",
    "the wavelet transform is a linear operation , hence the wavelet coefficients of a gaussian signal will also obey a gaussian distribution .",
    "so we can probe a full - sky map for non - gaussianity either by looking for deviations from gaussianity in wavelet space or in real space .",
    "we thus examine non - gaussian features in wavelet space and then localize them in real space . in wavelet space",
    "the localization can only be done at a specific scale , whereas in real space using the inverse framed wavelet transform technique , one can localize any deviations of gaussianity within some scale ranges that would be more natural for the real signals .",
    "this is because a map obtained from the inverse framed wavelet transform for a range of scales is equivalent to filtering the original map with a band - pass filter ; normally artifacts or spurious oscillations will be produced in a filtered map if the bandwidth is too narrow .    at a given scale ( @xmath78 )",
    ", we use the third and fourth moments about the mean as non - gaussian estimators for the test , i.e. , skewness ( @xmath79 ) and excess kurtosis ( @xmath80 ) given by : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of coefficients and @xmath83 is the standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients on scale @xmath78 . for a gaussian distribution ,",
    "the statistics @xmath79 and @xmath80 have zero mean value at each scale @xmath78 .",
    "thus deviations from zero value in these statistics will indicate the existence of non - gaussianity in the spherical wavelet coefficients and hence in the corresponding real map .    in the wavelet space",
    "we perform the cwt at scales @xmath84 $ ] corresponding to about ( @xmath85 ) on the sky , as well as within a range of directions @xmath86 with a @xmath1 interval .",
    "to localize any expected non - gaussian features , we perform the fswt ( ` fwtsph.m ` in the yawtb ) and the inverse fswt ( ` ifwtsph.m ` in the yawtb ) in order to filter the signal through some ranges of scales rather than only at a certain scale .",
    "scales larger than about @xmath87 on the sky are selected because the previous tests in wavelet space only found non - gaussianity on such scales ( mukherjee & wang 2004 ; vielva _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; mcewen _ et al .",
    "this is the first spherical inverse wavelet analysis applied to the cmb data in which the frame technique is essential .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed to construct confidence levels for the non - gaussianity test statistics described above .",
    "first , using cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) , we calculated the power spectrum @xmath88 using the cosmological parameters estimated by the wmap team ( spergel _ et al .",
    "second , 10,000 gaussian cmb realizations are produced and convolved at each of the wmap receivers with beam functions .",
    "third , we transform the simulated data from harmonic to real space and add gaussian noise according to the number of observations per pixel and the noise standard deviation per observation . finally , all the maps from the eight receivers are combined following equation ( [ eq : combination2 ] ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations of beams and the foreground where the cmb signal is almost negligible are also performed separately in a similar way .    since the weights used to construct the tegmark cleaned map differ from those used by the _",
    "team , we should carry out other gaussian simulations strictly following the tegmark construction method .",
    "however , there is no simple way of estimating the noise in each pixel , since much of the noise is due to residual foregrounds , which vary strongly across the sky and are thus correlated between pixels .",
    "thus , gaussian simulations of the q - v - w - combined map are also used for the tegmark map , since for both of the two maps , the weights sum to unity , and we assume that the slight difference in the linear combination of maps should not cause significant changes in the gaussian confidence levels ( mcewen _ et al .",
    "analysis in wavelet space has been performed on both of the q - v - w - combined _ wmap _ map ( here and throughout , all cmb maps used are foreground - removed maps ) and the tegmark cleaned map to test the non - gaussianity in the _ wmap _ first - year data .",
    "we also investigate the possible sources of the detected non - gaussianity .",

    "7(b ) , where the detected non - gaussian signal does not appear , indicating no correlation with galactic foregrounds .",
    "in addition , since the non - gaussian signals are detected at intermediate scales , the foreground emission templates can be excluded as the source of the detected non - gaussianity .",

    "although skewness values obtained from all receivers present very similar patterns , they show some frequency dependence in fig .",
    "the deviation numbers of each receiver and the corresponding significance levels from simulations of each band are displayed in table ( [ tableeach ] ) .",
    "although in one particular band , there are differences in the relative amplitudes of each receivers , we may find a systematic trend in frequency dependence among the three bands .",
    "skewness of q -band deviates more than that of v -band , which also deviates more than that of w -band .",
    "we have verified that these different levels of deviations from gaussian fluctuations are not caused by the different measurement noises of these receivers at different frequencies . the beams and noise",
    "have been calibrated out with simulations of each individual band .",
    "the slight differences in relative amplitudes from receivers of one particular band may be due to subtle interplay between the instrument behavior and foregrounds .",
    "if the central frequency of two receivers of the same band differ from each other , then different levels of foregrounds could remain in the different channels .",
    "note that w -band would be the band least contaminated with foreground synchrotron and free - free emissions , and dust emissions has not reached its maximum at the w - band frequency .",
    "we can take a rough quantitative comparison of total foreground components among the three bands by using fig .",
    "10a in bennett _",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "this figure shows that v -band and w -band would be cleaner than q -band if foreground residuals exist and that w -band would be the cleanest , particularly if synchrotron - related foreground residuals exist",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "7(b ) shows that the skewness of the tegmark cleaned map exhibits less deviations from gaussianity than the combined wmap map , perhaps due to more complete foreground removal in the tegmark map .",
    "meanwhile , if the non - gaussianity is totally due to the intrinsic temperature fluctuations , there is no reason why the deviations should be different at different frequencies and also different between the _ wmap _ team - recommended map and the tegmark map .",
    "in addition , noise properties can not explain features among different scale ranges",
    ". it might be true that due to different noise properties the the deviations in the combined _ wmap _ map and the tegmark cleaned map vary with each other on small scales ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "but on medium scales @xmath148 , in which range the non - gaussianity has been detected , values of the _ wmap _ map are systematically larger than those of the tegmark map .",
    "so if we believe that the tegmark map is cleaner than the _ wmap _ map , the foreground residual explanation is natural .",
    "we therefore conclude that the most likely source of the detected non - gaussianity is the residual foreground signals in the map . as a cautious note",
    ", we can not completely exclude the intrinsic cmb signal in this work as the source of the detected non - gaussianity , since we have not determined the exact nature of the possible foreground residual and quantified its contribution to the non - gaussianity systematically .",
    "whether this non - gaussianity is due to foreground residuals or due to intrinsic signals is still an open issue .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown several independent arguments for possible foreground residuals , so it is highly likely that they are at least a promising candidate for the source of the detected non - gaussianity .",
    "we have performed spherical wavelet analysis on the _ wmap _ first - year data and detected non - gaussianity in wavelet space and localized some non - gaussian spots in real space . in wavelet space , deviations from gaussianity are found in skewness on scales from @xmath149 to @xmath150 , on the sky with a maximum around @xmath151 , and in kurtosis on scales smaller than @xmath149 , with a maximum around @xmath152 toward azimuthal orientation @xmath153 , using anisotropic smw .",
    "several possible non - gaussian spots are detected in real space using isotropic smhw from both the q - v - w - combined _ wmap _ map and the tegmark cleaned map .",
    "we have also investigated the possible sources of this detected non - gaussianity in detail .",
    "systematic effects have been excluded , because ( 1 ) the skewness of the maps including possible systematic instrumental features do not show significant deviations from gaussian fluctuations at the scales where the non - gaussianity is detected and ( 2 ) the skewness is different at different frequencies and they all show very different patterns from the cmb maps . to be stricter , there still might be the possibility that some of the observations were due to unknown systematic effects .",
    "although we refer to different maps at the same frequency as evidence of lack of systematics , this does not exclude common - mode systematic artifacts .",
    "foreground templates adopted by the _ wmap _ team also make no significant contribution , because ( 1 ) the maps with significant contributions from foregrounds and noise derived from the _ wmap _ data do not show significant deviations from gaussian fluctuations and exhibit very different patterns from cmb signals and ( 2 ) maps containing overestimated _ wmap_-derived foreground template signals show no deviation from gaussianity . we find in several independent ways that the level of non - gaussianity is correlated positively with the level of possible foreground contaminations due to incomplete foreground removal . among the three bands",
    ", q -band seems to be the most contaminated , probably due to residual synchrotron emission .",
    "we conclude that the most likely source of the detected non - gaussianity is residual foreground signals in the map .",
    "although the _ wmap _ team do not include the q - band channels in any power spectrum computations for @xmath154 , which overlaps the scales where the non - gaussianity is detected , we want to remark that the non - gaussian features are also seen when excluding q -band .",
    "individual band results primarily show that q -band contributes more to the non - gaussianity than v and w bands , which is reasonable for foreground residuals , since emissions are dominant at some bands and minor at others .",
    "therefore , it is still premature to do more precise tests on the non - gaussianity of the intrinsic cmb fluctuations before we can identify the origin of these foreground signals , understand their nature , and finally remove them from the cmb maps completely .",
    "we will investigate the origin of the detected non - gaussian signals in our future work and also look forward to the _ wmap _ second - year data for confirming these results and detecting these non - gaussian signals more precisely .",
