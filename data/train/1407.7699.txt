    "nuclear binding energies are one of the most relevant quantities that define the atomic nucleus .",
    "apart from their intrinsic interest , the nuclear masses are specially important in determining the nucleosynthesis processes that occur in astrophysical environments .",
    "for example , they determine the limits of existence of the nucleus as a bound system of protons and neutrons ( drip lines ) , the @xmath1-values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , the particle separation energies that are needed to compute capture / emission rates , etc .",
    "therefore , a great effort in measuring masses of very exotic ( short - lived ) nuclei with high precision is currently made with the use of trapping and/or storage rings techniques  @xcite .    despite this significant progress , and the one expected in the near future with the arrival of new facilities worldwide",
    ", many nuclei will not be experimentally reachable . particularly important are those belonging to neutron rich regions that are relevant to better constraint the rapid neutron capture ( r - process ) nucleosynthesis , the mechanism behind the origin of more than the half of the elements beyond iron in the universe .",
    "hence , nuclear models able to compute with high precision the known masses , as well as to provide reliable extrapolations , are very much demanded .",
    "current theoretical nuclear mass tables are provided mainly by three different approaches : ( a ) microscopic - macroscopic ( mic - mac ) methods which improve the original liquid drop formula with microscopic corrections .",
    "the most commonly used of this kind are the finite range droplet model ( frdm )  @xcite or , more recently , the weizscker - skyrme ( ws ) mass model  @xcite .",
    "( b ) duflo - zuker ( dz ) approach based a functional of occupation numbers guided by the interacting shell model method  @xcite .",
    "( c ) microscopic methods based on hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approaches with skyrme ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and gogny functionals  @xcite .",
    "the above methods have reached a root mean square ( rms ) deviation from data  @xcite of 0.57 mev ( frdm ) , 0.298 mev ( ws ) , 0.36 mev ( dz ) , 0.51 mev ( hfb - skyrme ) and 0.798 mev ( hfb - gogny ) .",
    "this impressive agreement to the global behavior of the known masses is not sufficient to have a full confidence in the extrapolations to unknown regions since large deviations in the predictions of the different models are found .",
    "in addition , even if the overall performance is similar , some local deviations between the models in sensitive regions can largely affect the results of nucleosynthesis simulations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , theoretical models should be improved to reduce such uncertainties . in particular , _ ab - initio _ calculations are becoming available for medium mass systems although currently neither the range of applicability nor the accuracy reached by such methods are good enough to be applied to astrophysical purposes  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the short - mid term energy density functionals are still the most promising microscopic methods to compute nuclear properties in the whole nuclear chart with the required accuracy .",
    "these methods have been improved significantly in the last years by taking into account not only global fits to all known masses but also some constraints coming from _ ab - initio _ calculations in infinite nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "however , a mean field ( hfb ) approach is commonly used to solve the nuclear many - body problem and beyond - mean - field ( bmf ) corrections have been included phenomenologically to mimic rotational and vibrational corrections  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the last decade , a better treatment of such bmf correlations of even - even nuclei using symmetry restorations and configuration mixing methods have been implemented with skyrme , relativistic and gogny interactions  @xcite .",
    "these improvements have allowed the study of the appearance / disappearance of shell closures or shape mixing / coexistence / transitions phenomena , for example .",
    "concerning nuclear masses , these bmf correlations have been computed globally using particle number and angular momentum projection and generator coordinate method ( gcm ) with skyrme interactions  @xcite and using the five dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) with gogny  @xcite and , more recently , relativistic  @xcite interactions . due to the large computational burden of performing gcm with particle number and angular momentum restorations ,",
    "these pioneer global surveys were carried out assuming gaussian overlap approximations ( goa ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of global calculations for even - even nuclei performed with the gogny d1s",
    "@xcite and d1 m  @xcite interactions using implementations of the gcm and quantum number projection methods without gaussian overlap approximations .",
    "additionally , we discuss the convergence of the results -both hfb and bmf- as a function of the number of oscillator shells included in the basis where the many - body wave functions are expanded .",
    "results for odd systems including such advanced many - body techniques are still not available with the gogny interaction although some preliminary calculations in a single nucleus have been recently reported with skyrme forces  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in this survey we assume axial and parity symmetry conserving intrinsic states , exploring explicitly the axial quadrupole degree of freedom by performing one - dimensional gcm calculations . including triaxiality and/or octupolarity within the present framework increases prohibitively the computational time and it is beyond the scope of the present study",
    "nevertheless , global calculations including the triaxial  @xcite , and octupole  @xcite degrees of freedom within less involved many - body methods have been reported .",
    "in particular , 159 out of 5900 nuclei with triaxial ground states are found in the frdm model  @xcite .",
    "the largest differences in binding energies , @xmath4 mev , are obtained in regions around @xmath5ru and @xmath6gd . in ref .",
    "@xcite most of the nuclei are predicted to be axial symmetric ( spherical , prolate and oblate ) at the hfb level with gogny d1s .",
    "bmf correlations within the 5dch bring all the nuclei toward triaxial shapes in average even though in the hfb approximation are predicted spherical and/or axial symmetric . on the other hand , following ref .",
    "@xcite , only a few out of 818 nuclei calculated with gogny d1s - d1n - d1 m between @xmath7 are octupole deformed in the hfb ground state .",
    "these nuclei are obtained around ra , ba and zr region and the energy gain with respect to the octupole symmetric states are  @xmath8  mev .",
    "further bmf correlations including parity projection and gcm along the @xmath9 degree of freedom give extra binding energies as large as @xmath10 mev in the regions showing octupole deformation at the hfb level .",
    "however , in the rest of nuclei these correlation energies are of the order of 1 mev and vary smoothly with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , producing an almost constant shift in the total energies .    this document is organized as follows : first , a description of the method used to compute masses is given in sec .",
    "then , the results are discussed in sec .",
    "finally , a brief summary and outlook are presented in sec .",
    "the total energy ( negative in our convention ) of a given nucleus is calculated in the present work as the sum of two terms : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) energy ( mean field ) and @xmath15 is a beyond - mean - field ( bmf ) correction which includes particle number restoration , angular momentum projection and axial quadrupole shape mixing within the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite . both terms are computed with the same underlying interaction , namely , gogny d1s or d1 m parametrization .    for the sake of simplifying the notation , we express the theoretical energy throughout this work as the expectation value of a hamiltonian operator .",
    "however , it is important to point out that since the effective interactions used here are density - dependent , this notation is not truly rigorous and energy density functionals ( edfs ) should be defined instead of such expectation values .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a general discussion about this topic and refs .",
    "@xcite for the particular choice of the corresponding edfs used in this work .",
    "we start by reviewing briefly the hfb method  @xcite . in this microscopic approach ,",
    "based on the variational principle , the many - body wave function of the atomic nucleus is searched among a set of trial wave functions that are defined as quasiparticle vacua , @xmath16 :    @xmath17    those quasiparticles are defined as the most general linear combination of creation ( @xmath18 ) and annihilation ( @xmath19 ) single particle operators : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the variational parameters . since eq .",
    "[ hfbtrans ] breaks most of the symmetries of the original interaction , in particular , the particle number symmetry , the hfb wave function is constrained to have the correct mean value of the number of particles .",
    "therefore , the hfb equations  @xcite are found by the condition : @xmath23\\right)_{|\\phi\\rangle=|\\mathrm{hfb}\\rangle}=0 \\label{ritz}\\ ] ] with @xmath24=\\langle\\phi|\\hat{h}|\\phi\\rangle-\\lambda_{n}\\langle\\phi|\\hat{n}|\\phi\\rangle-\\lambda_{z}\\langle\\phi|\\hat{z}|\\phi\\rangle , \\label{eprime}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the hamiltonian and the neutron ( proton ) number operators , respectively ; @xmath27 is the hfb solution obtained by solving the corresponding hfb equations ( eqs .",
    "[ ritz]-[eprime ] ) ; and @xmath28 is a lagrange multiplier which ensures @xmath29",
    ". the normalization @xmath30 is also assumed .    in practical applications , the spherical harmonic oscillator ( s.h.o .",

    "the sum in such an equation runs over an infinite number of s.h.o .",
    "states but this sum must be truncated in actual implementations in computer codes .",
    "the results should not depend on the choice of the basis and the convergence of the results are obtained if a sufficiently large number of major s.h.o .",
    "shells ( @xmath31 ) are included . however , the computational burden increases significantly with the number of oscillator shells and a compromise between a better convergence and a reasonable computational time has to be considered ( see discussion below ) . in the present work ,",
    "@xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ benergy ] is computed with @xmath33 .",
    "the second term in the energy ( @xmath15 in eq .  [ benergy ] ) corresponds to corrections beyond the mean field ( hfb ) approximation . in principle , the energy should be computed by using bmf methods from the first place .",
    "however , these methods are much more time consuming than the corresponding hfb and the size of the s.h.o .",
    "basis used in this case is generally smaller . in the present work ,",
    "@xmath34 has been chosen for computing bmf effects .",
    "hence , bmf correction is defined as : @xmath35 this energy difference is less dependent on the number of oscillator shells included in the basis than the total energies separately , @xmath14 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will study explicitly this point below .    in the above equation , @xmath37",
    "is computed within a symmetry conserving configuration mixing ( sccm ) framework .",
    "the method contains simultaneous particle number and angular momentum projection ( pnamp ) of different intrinsic hartree - fock - bogoliubov - type states and a subsequent mixing of these states performed within the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) framework . in general ,",
    "different shapes ( axial and non - axial ) and collective coordinates can be included in the gcm calculation .",
    "however , the addition of more generating coordinates largely increases the computational time , especially if a triaxial angular momentum projection is performed .",
    "therefore , we have focused on the mixing of axial deformed and parity conserving states .",
    "further extensions will be explored in a future study .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to other bmf approaches like the 5dch , this method is variationally consistent with the underlying hfb functional , i.e. , lower total energies are always obtained when such correlations are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the more collective coordinates and symmetry restorations are included in the gcm the lower is the ground state energy obtained until the exact solution is eventually obtained . in this sense , the method is extensible to other degrees of freedom ( triaxiality , octupolarity , pairing content , ... ) without loosing its variational character . finally ,",
    "although the present calculations are restricted to axial , parity and time - reversal symmetric intrinsic states , the method can be applied to the whole nuclear chart .",
    "if a specific nucleus turns out to be , for instance , triaxial and/or octupole deformed , the amount of correlations obtained here will be smaller , though neither negligible nor meaningless , than the ones eventually obtained with including those degrees of freedom .    in the following ,",
    "the particular realization of the sccm method used here is described step - by - step .",
    "in contrast to the previous section ( sec .  [ mf ] ) , the particle number projected energy is minimized instead of the hfb one .",
    "this is the so - called variation after particle number projection ( pn - vap )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the set of intrinsic , hfb - type , trial wave functions , @xmath38 , are also constrained to have a given value of the axial quadrupole deformation , @xmath39 .",

    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath39 is related to @xmath47 by : @xmath48 being @xmath49 fm , @xmath50 the mass number and the plus ( minus ) sign indicates prolate ( oblate ) shapes .",
    "hence , the collective intrinsic deformation is well established within this framework and this fact allows the description of the states in the laboratory frame in terms of their intrinsic shapes unambiguously .",
    "once the set of intrinsic wave functions -@xmath51- is obtained , the final states are built through the ansatz provided by the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite . in this framework , the states are assumed to be linear combinations of particle number and angular momentum projected pn - vap states : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total angular momentum , @xmath54 the angular momentum projector applied to axial symmetric intrinsic states ( @xmath55 )  @xcite and @xmath56 labels different states obtained for a given value of @xmath53 .",

    ", we can state that both the symmetry energy problem and the overbinding produced by the inclusion of bmf effects can be solved by modifying the parametrization , as it is almost done with the introduction of the gogny d1 m interaction . however , the energy excess obtained in the magic nuclei ( relative to the energy predicted in the mid - shell nuclei ) , although reduced , is not washed out by taking into account the present bmf effects .",
    "it is still an open question whether the current bmf functionals , with parameters self - consistently fitted and probably extended to include other collective degrees of freedom and symmetry restorations , are able to produce flat energy differences instead of the parabolic behavior found in figs .",

    "since the present calculations are not fully converged , neither other degrees of freedom are taken into account -triaxiality , octupolarity , etc.- rms values for d1s and/or d1 m parametrizations given in table  [ tab1 ] should be considered as a qualitative description of the effect on the masses produced by the different approaches rather than the final values .",

    "nevertheless , a better convergence and the addition of other degrees of freedom are needed to check whether the present interactions can reproduce the smoothness of the experimental data .",
    "we finally compare the @xmath0 excitation energies obtained with our present gcm global calculations with the experimental data compiled in ref .",

    "the underlying interaction used in all of the calculations was gogny with two different parametrizations , d1s and d1 m . the convergence of the results as a function of the number of harmonic oscillator shells included in the basis has been analyzed . hence , the convergence of the total energies are not fully guaranteed and extrapolation schemes to infinite bases should be implemented in the near future .",
    "nevertheless , a large number of harmonic oscillator shells , @xmath33 , has been used for the hfb part , showing a better performance than the usual rule of having a number of single particle states equal to eight times the larger number among the protons and neutrons of a given nucleus . additionally , the calculated bmf correlations and particle separation energies are less dependent on the number of harmonic oscillator shells than the total energies .",
    "concerning those bmf correlations , both parametrizations , d1s and d1 m , give similar correlation energies with respect to their mean field solutions .",
    "compared to the experimental data , the d1s parametrization shows a symmetry energy problem which produces a lack of binding energy in neutron rich systems .",
    "this fact is reflected in a drift in the difference between theoretical and experimental energies for nuclei with a neutron excess which is corrected in the d1 m parametrization .",
    "however , strong shell effects ( stronger as a function of the neutron number ) are still present in both realizations and parabolic instead of flat energy differences are found between two consecutive magic numbers .",
    "bfm correlations tend to reduce these differences since rotational and vibrational corrections are larger in the mid - shell than in closed shell nuclei , but this reduction is not sufficient to remove the difference between the experimental and theoretical values .",
    "energy differences such as two - neutron separation energies are in a better agreement with experimental data but still not satisfactory .",
    "hence , bmf correlations bring the theoretical predictions towards the experimental values for @xmath83 shell gaps .",
    "however , some problems like artificial jumps , crossing and overestimation of the shell gaps for heavier are found in the calculations and they are not fully corrected by including bmf effects .    additionally , we have reported the results for @xmath0 excitation energies calculated with @xmath34 shells . we have obtained similar results for d1s and d1 m parametrizations , having a systematic stretching of the @xmath0 energies which is more related to the method used to solve the many - body problem rather than the parametrization itself .    as an outlook",
    ", some improvements should be taken into account in the near future , in particular :    1 .   convergence of the results with the properties of the harmonic oscillator working basis .",
    "2 .   triaxial and other degrees of freedom should be included explicitly in the calculations .    in the long - term ,",
    "a new parametrization of the gogny interaction ( or any other type of energy density functional ) including in the fitting procedure fully converged sccm corrections with triaxial and octupolar states is desirable .",
    "finally , new experimental data would be very helpful to constrain further the current and future models .",
