    "as the universe evolves , galaxies dissipate from underdense regions and progress towards matter concentrations by the action of gravity , forming both voids and filaments in the process .",

    "this interplay in the formation of voids and structures , allows to think of them as complementary , both encoding useful information to place constraints on the parameters of cosmological models .",
    "hence , while the predominant objects of the large scale galaxy distribution are structures such as groups , clusters , filaments or walls , voids emerge as the relevant features that shape , along with filaments , the structure at the largest scales .",
    "underdense regions have been identified and analyzed in numerical simulations @xcite and in galaxy catalogues showing similar properties regardless of the details of the identification methods @xcite and galaxy sample properties .",
    "@xcite show that voids defined by the spatial distribution of haloes and galaxies have similar statistical and dynamical properties .",
    "moreover , the statistics of void and matter distributions are strongly related @xcite and therefore voids are a powerful tool to study the formation and evolution of overdense structures .",

    "the simplest approach allows us to characterize individual voids as spherical regions with isotropic motions @xcite .",
    "however , more detailed analyses suggest that voids are not isolated structures but form part of an intricate network which affects their dynamical properties @xcite .    in a previous work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we performed a statistical study of the void phenomenon focussing on void environments . to that end ,",
    "we examined the distribution of galaxies around voids in the sdss by computing their integrated density contrast profile . by defining a separation criterion to characterize voids according to their surrounding environment , we obtained two characteristic void types , according to their large - scale radial density profiles : ( i ) voids with a density profile indicating an underdense region surrounded by an overdense shell , were dubbed s - type voids ; ( ii ) voids showing a continuously rising density profiles were defined as r - type voids .",
    "we also found that small voids are more frequently surrounded by overdense shells , and thus they are typically s - type . on the other hand ,",
    "larger voids are more likely classified as r - types , i.e. , with an increasing integrated density contrast profile , which smoothly rises towards the mean galaxy density . moreover , this behaviour of sdss voids results in a correlation between the fraction of voids surrounded by overdense shells and their sizes .",
    "this fraction continuously decreases as the void size increases , in a similar way for real , mock and direct numerical simulation samples .",
    "such a dichotomy in the behaviour of voids was first introduced by @xcite , based on an excursion set formalism .",
    "the authors classify void profiles and relate them to one of two processes : the void - in - void process describes the evolution of voids that are embedded in larger - scale underdensities .",
    "this is the case when small voids merge at an early epoch with other void to form a larger void at a later epoch . on the other hand ,",
    "underdense regions embedded within larger overdense regions undergo a so - called void - in - cloud process . in a hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "the filament network subtended by dark matter halos is modified by halo merging .",
    "eventually , some voids located in the interstices of this network will shrink at later times constituting the void - in - cloud scenario .",
    "this last case seems to affect more likely small rather than large voids .",
    "since the evolution of structure in the universe shapes the large scale matter clumps and the voids at the same time , both types of structures are responsive to the details of the contents of the universe , and the equation of state of its constituent species @xcite .",

    "in modern spectroscopic galaxy catalogues , redshift measurements are commonly used to estimate galaxy distances . however ,",
    "these quantities include a contribution from the peculiar velocity component in the line of sight . while this is a drawback when trying to obtain an accurate three - dimensional map of the local universe , dynamical studies can take advantage of the distortions imprinted in redshift space to obtain information about the velocities . in paper i we have analyzed the large scale environment around voids .",
    "we conclude that it is expected that the differences in the spatial distribution of galaxies around voids also manifests as differences in the dynamical properties .",
    "consequently , it is natural to infer that redshift space distortions on the correlation function will show these differences . in this section",
    "we search for the dynamics of voids in the redshift space distribution of galaxies around them .    to this end",
    ", we measure the void - galaxy cross - correlation function @xmath16 as a function of the projected ( @xmath17 ) and line of sight ( @xmath18 ) distances to the void centre .",
    "the @xmath16 function is the excess in the probability of having a galaxy around a given void centre .",
    "the standard method to estimate such probability is by counting void - galaxy pairs and normalising by the expected number of pairs for a homogeneous distribution . to compute this normalization",
    "it is necessary to produce a random distribution of points with the survey selection function .",
    "there are several estimators based on this counting procedure . in this work",

    "since we use volume limited samples of voids the random centre distribution is uniform .",
    "we found negligible differences between these two estimators for all void samples .",
    "thus for the sake of simplicity , we perform all the analysis using the @xcite estimator . the random sample of tracers needed for this estimator was generated following the same procedure described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the expected numerical density of galaxies at a given redshift , with a magnitude below the limit of the survey , is computed from a schechter luminosity distribution with parameters @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , the behaviour of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath18 , for low @xmath17 values , is fully affected by redshift space distortions .",
    "we have defined two types of centre voids depending on their density profiles .",
    "hereby we briefly describe the procedure carried out to define the centre samples ; more details can be found in paper i. the mean integrated density contrast profiles can be defined for @xmath28 intervals .",
    "as shown in paper i , these average curves have a well defined maximum at a distance @xmath29 from the void centre , except for the largest voids that exhibit an asymptotically increasing profile .",
    "we classify voids into two subsamples according to positive or negative values of the integrated density contrast at @xmath29 .",
    "voids surrounded by an overdense shell are dubbed s - type voids , and satisfy @xmath30 . on the other hand r - type voids",
    "are defined as those that satisfy the condition @xmath31 , which corresponds to voids with continuously rising density profiles .",

    "a continuously rising profile is expected in this case , and indeed it is observed in the @xmath17 axis at low @xmath18 values . however , as it can be seen in the upper right panel of this figure , an asymmetric structure appears , which is clearly originated on redshift space distortions .",

    "another numerical issue arises from the fact that the adopted estimator for the covariance gives by definition a positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "the covariance matrix takes the form of a sparse matrix , due to fact that the covariance of bin pairs at increasing separations approaches zero , but fluctuates due to the noise introduced by the covariance estimator .",

    "this issues can be overcome by `` tapering '' the covariance matrix , i.e. nullifying the covariance elements at large separations .",

    "the tapering interval of 4 bins is large enough to leave unaltered the principal features of the covariance matrix , ensuring at the same time a positive - definite system .",

    "indeed , the observed density profiles are consistent with the modelled profiles within uncertainties ( not shown for the sake of simplicity ) .",
    "regarding the velocity profiles ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ f_sdss_profile_velocity ] ) , it can be seen that the s - type voids show two different dynamical regimes . while inner regions are in expansion , the large  scale void walls are collapsing .",
    "this is in agreement with the void  in  cloud scenario introduced by @xcite and the direct measurements in our numerical simulations presented in paper i. on the other hand , the fitted velocity profiles of r - type voids never exhibit infall velocities as can be seen in the bottom - right panel if this figure .",

    "on the other hand larger voids are in expansion , due to they have a large fraction of r - type profiles ( paper i ) . using a model based on the linear theory of gravitational collapse , we model the void - galaxy cross - correlation function in redshift space to take advantage of the redshift - space distortions to obtain the dynamical properties of galaxies around voids .",
    "the analysis of the mock catalogues shows that the model successfully recovers the underlying velocity and density profiles of voids from redshift space samples .",
