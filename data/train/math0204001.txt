    "d.  hilbert asked , as problem  10 of his famous list of 23 problems posed to the mathematical community in 1900 , for an algorithm to decide , given a polynomial equation @xmath6 with coefficients in the ring @xmath7 of integers , whether there exists a solution with @xmath8 . in hilbert s time , there was no formal definition of algorithm , but presumably what he had in mind was a mechanical procedure that a human could in principle carry out , given sufficient paper , pencils , erasers , and time , following a set of strict rules requiring no insight or ingenuity on the part of the human . in the 1930s ,",
    "several rigorous models of computation were proposed as a substitute for the informal notion of `` mechanical procedure '' as above ( the @xmath9-definable functions of a.  church and s.  kleene , the recursive functions of k.  gdel and j.  herbrand , and the logical computing machines of a.  turing ) .",
    "these models , as well as others developed later , were shown to be equivalent ; this gave credence to the _ church - turing thesis _",
    ", which is the belief that every mechanical procedure can be carried out by a turing machine .",
    "therefore , the modern interpretation of hilbert s tenth problem is that it asks whether a turing machine can decide the existence of solutions .",
    "j.  matijasevi  @xcite , building on earlier work by m.  davis , h.  putnam , and j.  robinson  @xcite showed that there is no such turing machine . to describe their work in more detail",
    ", we need a few definitions .",
    "a subset @xmath10 of @xmath11 is called _ listable _ or _ recursively enumerable _ if there is an algorithm ( turing machine ) such that @xmath10 is exactly the set of @xmath12 that are eventually printed by the algorithm .",
    "a subset @xmath10 of @xmath11 is said to be _ diophantine _ , or to admit a _",
    "diophantine definition _ ,",
    "if there is a polynomial @xmath13 $ ] such that @xmath14 for example , the subset @xmath15 of @xmath7 is diophantine , since for @xmath16 , we have @xmath17    one can show using `` diagonal arguments '' that there exists a listable subset @xmath18 of @xmath7 whose complement is not listable .",
    "it follows that for this @xmath18 , there is no algorithm that takes as input an integer @xmath19 and decides in a finite amount of time whether @xmath19 belongs to @xmath18 ; in other words , membership in @xmath18 is undecidable .",
    "diophantine subsets of @xmath11 are listable : given @xmath20 , one can write a computer program with an outer loop with @xmath21 running through @xmath22 , and an inner loop in which one tests the finitely many @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and prints @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "davis  @xcite conjectured conversely that all listable subsets of @xmath11 were diophantine , and this is what matijasevi eventually proved .",
    "in particular , the set @xmath18 is diophantine . hence a positive answer to hilbert s tenth problem",
    "would imply that membership in @xmath18 is decidable .",
    "but membership in @xmath18 is undecidable , so hilbert s tenth problem is undecidable too ; that is , there is no algorithm that takes as input a polynomial @xmath29 $ ] , and decides whether @xmath30 has a solution in integers .    more generally ,",
    "if @xmath31 is any commutative ring with @xmath32 , one can define what it means for a subset of @xmath33 to be _ diophantine over @xmath31 _",
    ", by replacing @xmath7 by @xmath31 everywhere .",
    "similarly one can speak of _ hilbert s tenth problem over @xmath31 _ provided that one has fixed some encoding of elements of @xmath31 as finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet , so that polynomials over @xmath31 can be the input to a turing machine . for some rings @xmath31 ( for example , uncountable rings ) such an encoding may not be possible . in this case",
    "one should modify the problem , by specifying a countable subset @xmath34 of the set of all polynomials over @xmath31 and an encoding of elements of @xmath34 as finite strings of symbols , and then asking whether there exists a turing machine that takes as input a polynomial @xmath35 and decides whether @xmath30 has a solution over @xmath31 .",
    "for example , k.  kim and f.  roush  @xcite proved that hilbert s tenth problem over the purely transcendental function field @xmath36 is undecidable when one takes @xmath34 to be the set of polynomials with coefficients in @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "usually it is not necessary to specify exactly how the elements of @xmath34 are encoded , since usually given any two reasonable encodings , a turing machine can convert between the two .",
    "perhaps the most important unsolved question in this area is hilbert s tenth problem over the field @xmath38 of rational numbers .",
    "the majority view seems to be that it should be undecidable . to prove this",
    ", it would suffice to show that the subset @xmath7 of @xmath38 is diophantine over @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "b.  mazur has suggested that perhaps for any variety @xmath39 over @xmath38 , the topological closure of @xmath40 in @xmath41 has at most finitely many connected components ; if this is true , no such diophantine definition of @xmath7 over @xmath38 exists .",
    "see  @xcite and the more recent articles  @xcite and  @xcite for further discussion .",
    "the function field analogue , namely hilbert s tenth problem over the function field @xmath42 of a curve over a finite field , is known to be undecidable .",
    "the first result of this type is due to t.  pheidas  @xcite , who proved this for @xmath43 with @xmath44 odd .",
    "his argument was adapted and generalized by c.  videla  @xcite for @xmath43 with @xmath44 even , by a.  shlapentokh  @xcite for other function fields of odd characteristic , and finally by k.  eisentrger  @xcite for the remaining function fields of characteristic  2 .",
    "analogues are known also for many function fields over infinite fields of positive characteristic : see  @xcite and  @xcite .    for more results concerning hilbert s tenth problem ,",
    "see the book  @xcite , and especially the survey articles  @xcite and  @xcite therein .",
    "since the publication of that book , undecidability of hilbert s tenth problem has been proved also for function fields of curves @xmath39 over formally real fields @xmath45 with @xmath46 nonempty  @xcite ( in fact this is just one application of his results ) , and for function fields of surfaces over real closed or algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero  @xcite .",
    "in this article , our goal is to prove a result towards hilbert s tenth problem over rings of integers .",
    "if @xmath4 is a number field , let @xmath1 denote the integral closure of @xmath7 in @xmath4 .",
    "there is a known diophantine definition of @xmath7 over @xmath1 for the following number fields :        it is conjectured  @xcite that for _ every _ number field @xmath4 , there is a diophantine definition of @xmath7 over @xmath1 .",
    "our main theorem gives evidence for this conjecture , by reducing it to a plausible conjecture about the existence of certain elliptic curves .    before stating our theorem ,",
    "let us recall the mordell - weil theorem , which states that if @xmath3 is an elliptic curve over a number field @xmath4 , then the abelian group @xmath47 is finitely generated .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the rank of @xmath47 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath0 be number fields , and let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be their rings of integers .",
    "suppose that there exists an elliptic curve @xmath3 over @xmath4 such that @xmath5",
    ". then there exists a diophantine definition of @xmath1 over @xmath2 .      under the hypotheses of theorem  [ main ] , if in addition @xmath4 is of one of the types of number fields listed above for which a diophantine definition of @xmath7 over @xmath1 is known , then hilbert s tenth problem over @xmath2 is undecidable .",
    "j.  denef , at the end of  @xcite , sketches a simple proof of theorem  [ main ] in the case where @xmath49 is totally real and @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , he is also able to treat some totally real algebraic extensions @xmath49 of _ infinite _ degree over @xmath38 .",
    "but his proof technique does not seem to generalize easily to fields that are not totally real .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ main ] is similar to that of an older result , the theorem of  @xcite , which uses a @xmath32-dimensional torus ( a pell equation ) in place of the elliptic curve .",
    "we have been inspired also by the exposition of the `` weak version of the vertical method '' in  @xcite and by the ideas in  @xcite .",
    "the subset @xmath51 of @xmath2 is diophantine over @xmath2 : see proposition  1(c ) of  @xcite .",
    "we have a surjective map @xmath52 taking @xmath53 to @xmath54 . if @xmath55 is diophantine over @xmath49 , then the inverse image of @xmath10 under @xmath56 is diophantine over @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", we will also say that @xmath10 is diophantine over @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that in constructing diophantine definitions over @xmath2 , there is no harm in using equations with some variables taking values in @xmath2 and other variables taking values in @xmath49 .",
    "given @xmath57 , define the _ denominator ideal _ @xmath58 and the _ numerator ideal _ @xmath59 . also define @xmath60 to be the zero ideal .",
    "these ideals behave in the obvious way upon extension of the field .      1 .   for fixed @xmath62 , the set of @xmath63 in @xmath64 such that the fractional ideal @xmath65 divides",
