    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a quantum spacetime symmetry which predicts a correspondence between bosonic and fermionic fields  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is particularly appealing for theories of particle physics in that it reduces scalar field quadratic divergences to merely logarithmic .",
    "this fact allows for an elegant solution to the notorious gauge hierarchy problem , rendering the weak scale stable against quantum corrections and allowing for stable extrapolations of the standard model ( sm ) into the far ultraviolet ( @xmath8 ) regime  @xcite .",
    "thus , susy provides an avenue for connecting the standard model to ideas of grand unification ( guts ) and/or string theory , and provides a route to unification with gravity via local susy , or supergravity theories  @xcite .",
    "while models of weak scale supersymmetry are theoretically compelling , we note here that a variety of indirect evidence from experiment has emerged which provides support for the idea of weak scale susy :    * _ gauge coupling unification : _ the values of the three sm gauge couplings , measured at energy scale @xmath9 at the cern lep collider , when extrapolated to high energy scales via renormalization group ( rg ) running in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , very nearly meet at a point around @xmath10 gev  @xcite .",
    "unification of gauge couplings is predicted by many grand unified theories ( guts ) and string theories .",
    "gauge coupling unification is violated by numerous standard deviations under sm rg running . * _ precision electroweak measurements : _ fits of precision electroweak observables ( ewpo ) to susy model predictions find accord provided there exists a rather heavy susy particle mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , models such as minimal technicolor are highly stressed if not ruled out by ewpo . * _ top quark mass and electroweak symmetry breaking : _ the electroweak scalar potential is highly constrained in susy theories compared to the sm , and it is not immediately clear if electroweak symmetry can be properly broken , yielding the required vector boson and fermion masses while leaving the photon massless . in top - down theories ,",
    "the soft breaking higgs mass @xmath11 is driven to negative values by the large top quark yukawa coupling , triggering an appropriate breakdown of ew symmetry , provided that the top quark mass @xmath12 gev  @xcite .",
    "the latest measurements find @xmath13 gev  @xcite . *",
    "_ higgs mass : _ in the sm , the physical higgs scalar mass @xmath14 gev due to lep2 and lhc searches , and it is lighter than @xmath15 gev  @xcite from unitarity constraints  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "typically @xmath16 so that @xmath17 is sm - like . in this case ,",
    "@xmath18 gev as in the sm case , but also @xmath19 gev due to its more constrained mass calculation including radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "the latest data from the cern lhc and fermilab tevatron is consistent with @xmath20 with a @xmath21 evidence for @xmath22 gev  @xcite , squarely in the narrow susy window of consistency . *",
    "_ dark matter : _ while none of the sm particles have the right properties to constitute cold dark matter in the universe , susy theories offer several candidates  @xcite .",
    "these include the neutralino ( a wimp candidate ) , the gravitino or a singlet sneutrino . in susy theories where the strong @xmath23 problem is solved via the peccei - quinn mechanism , there is the added possibility of mixed 1 .",

    "_ baryogenesis : _ the measured baryon to photon ratio @xmath24 is not possible to explain in the sm .",

    "electroweak baryogenesis ( now nearly excluded by limits on @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite ) , 2 .",
    "thermal and non - thermal leptogenesis  @xcite , and 3 .",
    "affleck - dine baryo- or leptogenesis  @xcite .      while the above laundry list is certainly compelling for the existence of weak scale susy in nature , we are faced with the fact that at present there is no evidence for direct superparticle production at high energy colliders , especially at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments have accumulated @xmath2 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity from @xmath4 collisions at @xmath1 tev in 2011 ( lhc7 ) , and they anticipate collecting @xmath27 fb@xmath3 at @xmath28 tev in 2012 ( lhc8 ) .",
    "recent analyses by the cms experiment  @xcite using 4.4 fb@xmath3 of data have now excluded @xmath29 gev in the msugra ( also known as cmssm ) model , for the case of @xmath30 , while values of @xmath31 gev are excluded in the case where @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , fits of the msugra model as recently as 2010  @xcite to a variety of observables including ewpo , @xmath33 , @xmath34-meson decay branching fractions and neutralino cold dark matter density predicted susy to lie exactly in this excluded range . in addition , if the light susy higgs boson turns out to have @xmath22 gev , then the minimal versions of gauge - mediated and anomaly - mediated susy breaking models will likely be ruled out  @xcite , since it is difficult to obtain such large values of @xmath26 in these models unless the sparticle mass spectra exist with a lightest mssm particle with mass greater than about 5 tev  @xcite .",
    "while the above results may seem disconcerting , at the same time they were not unanticipated by many theorists .",
    "whereas susy theories solve a host of problems as mentioned above , they also bring with them considerable phenomenological baggage  @xcite .",
    "some of these susy problems include the following :    * the susy flavor problem  @xcite : in susy models based on gravity - mediation , it is generally expected that large flavor - violating terms will occur in the lagrangian  @xcite , giving rise to large contributions to the kaon mass difference , and flavor violating decays such as @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "solutions to the susy flavor problem include 1 .",
    "degeneracy of matter scalar masses , in which case a susy gim mechanism suppresses flavor violation  @xcite , 2 .",
    "alignment of squark and quark mass matrices  @xcite , or 3 .",
    "decoupling mainly of first / second generation scalars ( @xmath37 tev )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the susy flavor problem provided strong impetus for the development of gmsb and amsb models , where universality of scalars with the same quantum numbers is automatically expected . * the susy @xmath23 problem : in this case , it is expected in gravity mediation that @xmath23-violating phases in the soft susy breaking terms and perhaps @xmath38 parameter will give rise to large electron and neutron ( and other ) electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "solutions include dialing the @xmath23-violating phases to zero , or decoupling .",
    "models such as gmsb and amsb are again not expected to have complex , cp - violating soft terms .",
    "* proton decay in susy gut theories : in susy gut theories , the proton is expected to decay to @xmath39 via colored higgsino @xmath40 exchange .",
    "the lifetime is expected to occur at levels below experimental limits  @xcite . since @xmath41 , large squark masses",
    "can again suppress proton decay .",
    "* the gravitino problem  @xcite : in models of gravity - mediation , the superhiggs mechanism generates susy breaking by giving the gravitino a mass @xmath42 .",
    "the gravitino mass sets the scale for the visible sector soft breaking terms , and so one expects sparticle masses of order @xmath42 .",
    "however , thermal production of gravitinos in the early universe can lead to either 1 .",
    "an overproduction of dark matter ( here , the gravitinos would decay to the stable lsp , or even be the lsp ) , or 2 .",
    "late - time decays of gravitinos at time scales @xmath43  s after the big bang would lead to dissolution of the light nuclei built up during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "solutions to the gravitino problem include 1 .",
    "a rather low re - heat temperature @xmath44 gev after inflation so that thermal gravitino production is suppressed  @xcite ( but such low @xmath45 values conflict with some baryogenesis mechanisms such as leptogenesis , which seems to require @xmath46 gev ) , 2 . a rather light gravitino with @xmath47 gev , which enhances the goldstino coupling , or 3 . a rather heavy gravitino @xmath48 tev , which lowers the gravitino lifetime so that @xmath49 sec , and gravitinos decay before bbn  @xcite .    while some proposed solutions solve individual problems listed above ( _ e.g. _ alignment for the susy flavor problem , low @xmath45 for the gravitino problem , small phases for the susy @xmath23 problem ) , there is one solution _ decoupling of first / second generation matter scalars_ which goes a long way to solving all four . sets the mass scale for the heaviest of the scalars ; in this case , multi - tev scalar masses would proceed from a multi - tev gravitino mass . ]",
    "but what of fine - tuning constraints in susy models , which seemingly require sparticle masses near the weak scale  @xcite ?      the connection between the susy breaking scale and the magnitude of the weak scale can be understood most directly by minimization of the scalar potential in the mssm to determine the magnitude of the electroweak vacuum expectation values .",
    "the scalar potential gains contributions from three sectors : @xmath50 and with 50 field `` directions '' in the mssm , the scalar potential is rather daunting . under rather mild conditions , charge and color breaking minima can be avoided , so that instead we just minimize in the neutral / non - colored scalar field directions .",
    "a well - defined local minimum can be found where the vacuum expectation values of the real parts of the neutral higgs fields are given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 boson acquires a mass @xmath55 . including radiative corrections , the scalar potential minimization condition is then written as @xmath56 here , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "arise from radiative corrections  @xcite , and are given in the 1-loop approximation to the higgs effective potential by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the one - loop correction to the tree - level potential , and the derivatives are evaluated at the physical vacuum .",
    "it is then reasonable to say that the theory yields a natural value of @xmath61 if the individual terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zmass ] ) are comparable in magnitude so that the observed value of @xmath61 is obtained without resorting to large cancellations .",
    "indeed this is why @xmath62 has been suggested as a measure of naturalness  @xcite , with theories where @xmath63 being the `` most natural '' .",
    "this relationship must be accepted with some latitude , since values of @xmath64 ( 100  gev)@xmath65 are phenomenologically excluded . here",
    ", we will adopt @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , but might be as high as @xmath68 gev . of course , there is nothing special about the magnitude of @xmath38 , so that the same considerations apply equally to all the terms in eqn  [ eq : zmass ] , including those involving the radiative corrections .",
    "naturalness thus requires that each _ individual _ term in ( [ eq : zmass ] ) be @xmath69 .    the largest contributions to @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zmass ] ) arise from superpotential yukawa interactions of third generation squarks involving the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "the order of magnitude of these contributions is given by @xmath71 and so grows quadratically with the top squark masses .",
    "clearly , the top squark ( and by @xmath72 gauge symmetry , also @xmath73 ) masses must then be bounded from above by the naturalness conditions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that requiring @xmath74 leads to @xmath75  gev . scaling this up to allow @xmath38 values up to",
    "150 - 200  gev leads to a corresponding bound @xmath76  tev .",
    "in other words , from this perspective , models with @xmath77  gev and top squarks at the tev scale or below are preferred by naturalness .",
    "it is also worth remarking that since @xmath78 for moderate to large values of @xmath79 , the heavier higgs scalars can naturally be at the several - tev scale because of the appearance of @xmath80 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zmass ] ) .",
    "notice , however , that the bound of @xmath81 on each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zmass ] ) translates to an upper bound @xmath82 .",
    "there will also be corresponding constraints on other sparticles such as electro - weak charginos and neutralinos that directly couple to the higgs sector , but since these couplings are smaller than @xmath83 and there are no color factors , the constraints will be correspondingly weaker .",
    "sparticles such as first and second generation squarks and sleptons that have no direct / significant couplings to the higgs sector are constrained only via two - loop effects and can easily be in the 10 - 50 tev range",
    ". an important exception would be the gluino , since radiative corrections to the top squark mass are proportional to @xmath84  @xcite . using @xmath85 and setting logs to be order unity",
    ", we expect that @xmath86 . for top squarks to remain in the @xmath87  tev range",
    ", the gluino must be lighter than 3 - 4 tev . in models with electroweak gaugino mass unification , electroweak - inos",
    "would then automatically not destroy naturalness .    to summarize",
    ", naturalness considerations suggest that susy models should give rise to a mass spectrum characterized by    @xmath88  gev ,    third generation squarks @xmath89  tev ,    @xmath90  tev and ssb electroweak - ino masses smaller than 1 - 2  tev    @xmath91 tev .",
    "the latter weak constraint on first / second generation matter scalars allows for a decoupling solution to the susy flavor , @xmath23 , @xmath92-decay and ( indirectly ) gravitino problems .",
    "susy models with the above generic spectra have been dubbed `` natural susy ''  @xcite .",
    "this spectra is closely related to _",
    "effective susy_@xcite , but with the additional requirement that @xmath93 gev which would likely give rise to a higgsino - like lightest neutralino @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , models such as msugra with rather heavy top squarks are expected to be highly fine - tuned , even when @xmath38 is small as in the hyperbolic branch / focus point ( hb / fp ) region .",
    "the remainder of this report is geared towards presenting a new set of supersymmetry benchmark models suitable for ilc investigations , while maintaining consistency with the latest indirect and direct constraints on supersymmetric models , especially taking into account what has been learned from recent lhc searches . in sec .",

    "in this section , we review briefly indirect constraints on susy models from muon @xmath95 measurements , rare @xmath34-decay branching fractions along with an updated discussion of the role of dark matter in susy models .",
    "the magnetic moment of the muon @xmath96 was measured by the muon @xmath95 collaboration  @xcite and has been found to give a @xmath97 discrepancy with sm calculations based on @xmath0 data  @xcite : @xmath98=(28.7\\pm 8.0)\\times 10^{-10}$ ] .",
    "when @xmath99-decay data are used to estimate the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution rather than low energy @xmath0 annihilation data , the discrepancy reduces to @xmath100 , corrensponding to @xmath101=(19.5\\pm 8.3)\\times 10^{-10}$ ] .    the susy contribution to the muon magnetic moment is@xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 stands for electroweak gaugino masses and",
    "@xmath104 is the characteristic sparticle mass circulating in the muon - muon - photon vertex correction : here , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "attempts to explain the muon @xmath95 anomaly using supersymmetry usually invoke sparticle mass spectra with relatively light smuons and/or large @xmath79 ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . some susy models where @xmath105 is correlated with squark masses ( such as msugra )",
    "are now highly stressed to explain the @xmath33 anomaly .",
    "in addition , since naturalness favors a low value of @xmath109 , tension again arises between a large contribution to @xmath110 and naturalness conditions .",
    "these tensions motivate scenarios with non - universal scalar masses . of the benchmark scenarios discussed in the following , some feature light smuons which raise @xmath33 to its experimental value , while others are compatible with the standard model prediction .",

    "this is somewhat higher than the sm prediction  @xcite of @xmath113 .",
    "susy contributions to the @xmath35 decay rate come mainly from chargino - top - squark loops and loops containing charged higgs bosons , and so are large when these particles are light and when @xmath79 is large  @xcite .",

    "the branching fraction for @xmath122 decay is calculated  @xcite in the sm to be @xmath123 .",
    "this is to be compared to the value from the heavy flavor averaging group  @xcite , which finds a measured value of @xmath124 , in agreement with the sm prediction , but leaving room for additional contributions .",

    ", a very compelling and simple scenario has emerged to explain the presence of dark matter in the universe with an abundance roughly five times that of baryonic matter .",
    "the wimp miracle scenario posits that weakly interacting massive particles would be in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic plasma at very high temperatures @xmath126 .",
    "as the universe expands and cools , the wimp particles would freeze out of thermal equilibrium , locking in a relic abundance that depends inversely on the thermally - averaged wimp ( co)-annihilation cross section  @xcite .",
    "the wimp `` miracle '' occurs in that a weak strength annihilation cross section gives roughly the measured relic abundance provided the wimp mass is of the order of the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "the lightest neutralino of susy models has been touted as a protypical wimp candidate  @xcite .",
    "while the wimp miracle scenario is both simple and engaging , it is now clear that it suffers from several problems in the case of susy theories .",
    "the first of these is that in general susy theories where the lightest neutralino plays the role of a thermally produced wimp , the calculated relic abundance @xmath127 is in fact typically two - to - four orders of magnitude larger than the measured abundance @xmath128 in the case of a bino - like neutralino , and one - to - two orders of magnitude lower than measurements in the case of wino- or higgsino - like neutralinos  @xcite .",
    "in fact , rather strong co - annihilation , resonance annihilation or mixed bino - higgsino or mixed wino - bino annihilation is needed to obtain the measured dark matter abundance .",
    "each of these scenarios typically requires considerable large fine - tuning of parameters to gain the measured dark matter abundance  @xcite .",
    "the case where neutralinos naturally give the measured cdm abundance is when one has a bino - like neutralino annihilating via slepton exchange with slepton masses in the 50 - 70 gev range : such mass values were long ago ruled out by slepton searches at lep2 .",
    "the second problem with the susy wimp miracle scenario is that it neglects the gravitino , which is an essential component of theories based on supergravity .",
    "gravitinos can be produced thermally at high rates at high re - heat temperatures @xmath45 after inflation .",
    "if @xmath129 , then gravitino decays into a stable lsp can overproduce dark matter for @xmath130 gev . even at much lower @xmath131 gev , thermal production of gravitinos followed by late decays ( since gravitino decays are suppressed by the planck scale ) tend to dissociate light nuclei produced in the early universe , thus destroying the successful picture of big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "the third problem is that the susy wimp scenario neglects at least two very compelling new physics effects that would have a strong influence on dark matter production in the early universe .",
    "the first of these is that string theory seems to require the presence of at least one light ( @xmath132 tev ) moduli field  @xcite .",
    "the moduli can be produced at large rates in the early universe and decay at times @xmath133 sec after the big bang .",
    "depending on their branching fractions , they could either feed additional lsps into the cosmic plasma  @xcite , or decay mainly to sm particles , thus diluting all relics present at the time of decay  @xcite .",
    "the second neglected effect is the strong @xmath23 problem , which is deeply routed in qcd phenomenology  @xcite . after more than three decades , the most compelling solution to the strong @xmath23",
    "problem is the hypothesis of a peccei - quinn axial symmetry whose breaking gives rise to axion particles with mass @xmath134 ev  @xcite .",
    "the axions can be produced non - thermally via coherent oscillations  @xcite , and also would constitute a portion of the dark matter . in susy theories , the axions are accompanied by @xmath135-odd spin-@xmath136 axinos @xmath137 and @xmath135-even spin-0 saxions @xmath138  @xcite .",
    "thermal production of axinos and non - thermal production of saxions can either feed more dark matter particles into the cosmic plasma , or inject additional entropy , thus diluting all relics present at the time of decay .",
    "theoretical predictions for the relic abundance of dark matter in these scenarios are available but very model - dependent . in the case of mixed axion - neutralino dark matter",
    ", it is usually very difficult to lower a standard overabundance of neutralinos , but it is also very easy to bolster a standard underabundance  @xcite .",
    "this latter case may lead one to consider susy models with a standard underabundance of wino - like or higgsino - like neutralinos as perhaps the more compelling possibility for cdm . in the case of mixed axion - neutralino cdm",
    ", it can be very model - dependent whether the axion or the neutralino dominates the dm abundance , and cases where there is a comparable admixture of both are possible .",
    "the upshot for ilc or lhc physics is that one should nt take dark matter abundance constraints on susy theories too seriously at this point in time .      as of spring 2012 , a variety of direct and indirect wimp dark matter detection searches are ongoing .",
    "several experiments ",
    "dama / libra , cogent and cresst  claim excess signal rates beyond expected backgrounds .",
    "these various excesses can be interpreted in terms of a several gev wimp particle , although the three results seem at first sight inconsistent with each other .",
    "it is also possible that muon or nuclear decay induced neutron backgrounds  which are very difficult to estimate  contribute to the excesses .",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental analyses are ongoing to sort the situation out .",
    "a wimp particle of a few gev seems hard to accommodate in susy theories .",
    "there also exists claims for measured positron excesses in cosmic rays above expected backgrounds by the pamela collaboration  @xcite and claims for an electron excess by the fermi - lat group  @xcite .",
    "while these claims can be understood in terms of very massive wimps of order hundreds of gev , it is unclear at present whether the positrons arise from exotic astrophysical sources  @xcite or simply from rare mis - identification of cosmic protons .",
    "a variety of other direct wimp search experiments have probed deeply into wimp - model parameter space , with no apparent excesses above sm background . at this time ,",
    "the best limits come from the xenon-100 experiment  @xcite , which excludes wimp - proton scattering cross sections of @xmath139 pb at 90%cl for @xmath140 gev .",
    "the xenon-100 , lux and cdms experiments seem poised decisively to probe the expected parameter space of mixed bino - higgsino dark matter  @xcite ( as occurs for instance in focus point susy of the msugra model ) in the next round of data taking .",
    "it is possible in susy theories that gravitinos are the lightest susy particle , and could fill the role of dark matter . in gravity - mediation , the gravitino is expected to have mass of order the weak scale . in this case ,",
    "late decays of thermally produced neutralinos into gravitinos are often in conflict with bbn constraints . if the gravitinos are much lighter , well below the gev scale , then their goldstino coupling is enhanced and bbn constraints can be evaded .",
    "this scenario tends to occur for instance in gauge - mediated susy theories .",
    "the simplest gmsb scenarios now appear in conflict with higgs mass results if indeed lhc is seeing @xmath26 at @xmath141  gev  @xcite .",
    "we will , however , present an example of a non - minimal gmsb model which is compatible with a higgs mass of @xmath141  gev .",
    "in this section , we present a very brief summary of the status of lhc searches for susy higgs bosons and for susy particles as of april 2012 .",

    "their analyses exclude a sm - like higgs boson over the mass range @xmath143 gev . combining this range with a fit of precision electroweak data to sm predictions then allows a sm - like higgs boson to live in the narrow mass range of @xmath144 gev .",

    "the basis of this latter statement rests on the fact that a decoupling of first / second generation matter scalars either solves or at least greatly ameliorates : the susy flavor problem , the susy @xmath23 problem , the susy gut proton decay problem and , in the context of gravity mediation where the gravitino mass sets the scale for the most massive susy particles , the gravitino problem .",
    "in contrast , examination of electroweak fine - tuning arguments , applied to the radiatively corrected susy scalar potential imply that models with 1 .",
    "low @xmath88 gev , 2 .",
    "third generation squarks with @xmath399 tev and 3 .",
    "@xmath400 tev are favored .",
    "since first / second generation matter scalars do nt enter the electroweak scalar potential , these sparticles can indeed exist in the 10 - 50 tev regime  as required by decoupling  without affecting fine - tuning .",
    "the class of models which fulfill these conditions are called _ natural susy _ or ns models .",
    "ns models are typically very hard to detect at lhc unless some third generation squarks are very light @xmath401 gev , with a large enough decay mass gap to yield sufficient visible energy .",
    "the set of light higgsinos @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath94 can be produced at high rates at lhc , but the very tiny visible energy release from higgsino decays makes them exceedingly hard to detect .",
    "however , ns at an ilc may well be a boon !",
    "an ilc would likely then be a _ higgsino factory _ in addition to a higgs factory .",
    "the small visible energy release from higgsino - like chargino decays should be visible against backgrounds originating from two - photon initiated processes , especially when an additional hard isr photon is required .",
    "in addition , there is a good chance that some or even most third generation squarks and sleptons may be accessible given high enough beam energy . as the fine - tuning upper bound @xmath280 increases",
    ", the ns spectrum blends into hidden susy where the higgsinos are still light , but the third generation is lifted beyond lhc / ilc reach .",
    "the hs collider phenomenology is expected to be very similar to that emerging from a non - minimal gmsb model suggested by brmmer and buchmller ( bb ) .",
    "we also present several benchmark models consistent with lhc and other constraints which predict some varied phenomenology .",
    "one nuhm2 point with heavy matter scalars and @xmath402 gev contains @xmath120 and @xmath250 higgs bosons which would also be accessible to ilc . a model with",
    "non - universal gaugino masses ( nugm ) allows for chargino pair production at ilc followed by @xmath403 decay , leading to @xmath361 events .",
    "also , a rare surviving benchmark from msugra / cmssm is presented in the far focus point region with @xmath402 gev , with matter scalars at @xmath404 tev , where chargino pairs of the mixed bino - higgsino variety are accessible to an ilc .",
    "we also present one benchmark point from the kallosh - linde ( kl ) model . in this case ,",
    "matter scalars have masses @xmath405 tev , but gaugino masses follow the amsb pattern , with the @xmath201 and @xmath94 being nearly pure wino , with @xmath406 gev mass gap .",
    "if the mass gap is small enough , then charginos can fly a measureable distance before decay",
    ". it might be possible to detect @xmath407 soft debris including possible highly ionizing tracks which terminate into soft pions .",
    "the phenomenology of this model is similar to that expected from g2mssm of acharya _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . finally , we present pmssm and nmh models with light charginos and sleptons which is in accord with the @xmath33 anomaly , @xmath408 gev and with a standard neutralino relic abundance @xmath409 .",
    "the ilc - relevant part of the spectrum is very similar to the well - studied sps1a scenario  @xcite ( or its variant sps1a ) .    in summary ,",
    "results from the lhc7 run in 2011 have resulted so far in no sign of susy particles , although impressive new limits on gluino and squark masses have been determined .",
    "in addition , much of the expected mass range for a sm - like higgs boson has been ruled out save for the narrow window of @xmath410 gev @xmath411 127 gev .",
    "indeed , within this window , there exists @xmath412 hint for a 125 gev higgs signal in several different channels from both atlas and cms , and also from cdf / d0 at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "if the higgs - hint is verified , this can be regarded as an overall positive for weak scale supersymmetry in that the higgs would fall squarely within the narrow predicted susy window . while the lack of gluino and first generation squark signals at lhc7 may at first be disconcerting , it must be remembered that first generation squarks , and to some degree gluinos , contribute little to naturalness arguments which connect susy breaking to the weak scale .",
    "naturalness arguments do favor a value of @xmath413 , with perhaps @xmath38 ranging as high as @xmath68 gev .",
    "in this case , a spectrum of light higgsinos is anticipated .",
    "such light higgsinos would be very difficult to detect at lhc , while an ilc with @xmath414 tev would be a _",
    "higgsino factory _ , in addition to a higgs factory !",
    "naturalness arguments , and also the muon @xmath95 anomaly , portend a rich assortment of new matter states likely accessible to the ilc , although such states will be difficult for lhc to detect .",
    "we hope the benchmark models listed here give some view as to the sort of new susy physics which may be expected at ilc in the post lhc7 era .",
