    "the efficiency of transport of active matter in microscopic systems is an issue of paramount importance in a number of fields of science including biology , chemistry , and logistics .",
    "looking particularly at drug  delivery design scenarios @xcite , ion moving in molecular cytosol @xcite , percolation of aggressive acids through reactive porous media @xcite , the traffic of pedestrians in regions with drastically reduced visibility ( e.g. , in the dark or in the smoke ) @xcite ( see also the problem of traffic of cars on single  lane highways @xcite ) , we see that the efficiency of a medical treatment , the properties of ionic currents thorough cellular membranes , the durability of a highly permeable material , or the success of the evacuation of a crowd of humans , strongly depends on the time spent by the individual particle ( colloid , ion , acid molecule , or human being ) in the constraining geometry ( body , molecule , fabric , or corridor ) .    in this framework , we focus our attention on the study of the simplest 2d scenario that mimics alike dynamics .",
    "the _ gedankenexperiment _ we make is the following : we imagine a vertical strip whose top and bottom entrances are in touch with infinite particle reservoirs at constant densities .",
    "assume particles are driven downwards by the boundary densities difference and/or an external constant and uniform field ( electrical , gravitational , generally ",
    "accepted crowd opinion , ... ) .",
    "let the _ residence time _ be the typical time a particle entering the strip at stationarity from the top boundary needs to exit through the bottom one . in this framework , under the assumption that particles in the strip interact only via hard ",
    "core exclusion , we study the _",
    "ballistic  like _ versus the _ diffusion  like _ dependence of the residence time on the external driving force ( main source of anisotropy in the system ) , on the length of the strip , on the horizontal diffusion , and , finally , on the choice of the boundary condition at the bottom .",
    "we recover the structure of the fluxes as well as the residence times proven mathematically by derrida and co  authors in @xcite for the asymmetric simple exclusion model on the line ; see also @xcite for a more recent approach . in chemistry single file diffusion has been demonstrated for zeolite catalysts @xcite to dramatically reduce the rate of a reaction .",
    "this happens in particular when zeolitic microporous systems are used with linear micropores with dimensions that are similar as the size of the molecules that are converted .",
    "since they can not pass single file inhibition occurs ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , we discover new effects that are purely due to the choice of the 2d geometry and which are therefore absent in a 1d lattice .",
    "the most prominent , within the precision of our numerical simulations , is the non  monotonic behavior in changes in the horizontal displacement probability in the bouncing back regime reported in section  [ s : caso020 ] . under certain conditions ,",
    "particles start accumulating near the bottom exit of the strip .",
    "this crowding leads to a bouncing - back effect in which particles trying to escape are reflected in the bulk .",
    "we observe that , in such a case , increasing the frequency of horizontal movements help particles to overcome obstacles and to find their way to the exit .    to investigate this model ,",
    "we employ several working techniques including taylor series truncations for the derivation of the mean  field equations , ode analysis of the stationary case , estimates involving the structure of the stationary measure for birth and death processes on a line , as well as monte carlo simulations to exploit the resources offered by the various parameter regimes . in 1d , this model has been widely studied both by the mathematical and physical communities , see e.g. @xcite . in 2d , the situation is very much unexplored especially in the asymmetric case .",
    "we deal with this precise problem and we give a rather complete description of the phenomenon .",
    "our results , which are based on a thorough study of two simplified models and extensive monte carlo simulations , open new mathematical problems concerning the typical time a particle need to cross a region in hard  core repulsion regime .",
    "more precisely , in the paper we develop two analytic approaches to predict the mean residence time : a macroscopic mean field theory and a semi",
    " microscopic approach in which the particle motion is imagined as that of a single particle against a prescribed background density profile borrowed from the macroscopic mean field theory .",
    "these two different predictions are very similar to each other but for the regime described above in which the non  monotonic effect is found . in this regime the horizontal displacement probability tunes the system behavior from the macroscopic prediction to the semi  microscopic one , with the two limits recovered , respectively , in the zero and one horizontal probability displacement cases .",
    "the importance of the exclusion rule on the time dependence of the typical distance covered by a particle is not new in the scientific literature . due to the exclusion rule",
    ", the asymmetric process on a square lattice that we discuss here can be considered to occur on a percolating lattice .",
    "the symmetric exclusion case has been widely explored for diffusion , as for instance the `` ant in the labirinth '' by de gennes @xcite .",
    "the distance travelled by the ant is proportional to the square root of the time ( random walk diffusion ) as long as the site occupancy is low , but , when the critical @xmath0 site occupation is approached , this changes to a time dependence close to cubic root of time . beyond this critical site occupancy",
    "the order in time rapidly drops .",
    "the excluded volume problem in several dimensions has not yet found however a satisfactory solution @xcite . a related but similar phenomenon occurs in the symmetric 1d case .",
    "when site occupation increases the distance time relation becomes the fourth root of time @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric problem in 2d , that we are interested in , can be more easily addressed as asymmetric exclusion with driven diffusion , see @xcite for a paper and @xcite for a complete review . in the 1d total asymmwtric case ( particles can move only from the top to the bottom ) , using a kinematic wave theory related approach and the method of maximum transported current @xcite , it is identified a three parameter space region as a function of the rates at which particles would enter ( from the top ) or exit ( from the bottom ) the strip .",
    "these regions closely relate to the particle density where percolation sets in ( on a square lattice with stochastic bond formation the percolation threshold is 0.5 ) . in this paper",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the case where the relative probability for a particle to enter the strip ( from the top ) is one . in this case",
    "the two situations than can be distinguished are the high density phase ( exit probability smaller than @xmath1 ) and the maximum current phase ( exit probability larger than @xmath1 ) . interestingly the difference relates to an occupation density that is larger or less than the critical point of percolation .    in the lower density phase the average density is @xmath1 and",
    "current is maximum , at the density higher than the percolation threshold it decreases with the exit rate .",
    "we derive an equation for the mean field concentration profile which , in our setup , depends only on the vertical spatial coordinate .",
    "the profile depends on the reservoir boundary conditions and on the vertical drift , namely , the ratio between down and up jump probabilities divided by their sum , that , we recall , we do not considered necessarily equal to one ( as in the total asymmetric case discussed above ) . in the large drift case ,",
    "we recover density profiles consistent with the phase diagram described above which has been proven to be correct in the total asymmetric case @xcite .    in this scenario ,",
    "as already mentioned above , we setup two different analytic computations of the residence time : a semi ",
    "microscopic approach based on the analogy with a 1d birth and death model with not homogeneous background and a purely macroscopic mean field approximation . in the last approach the residence time is finally computed in terms of the stationary current .",
    "it is important to stress that , for zero drift , these two different approach seem to explain the behavior of the model in two different regimes , namely , low and high horizontal displacement probability . from our point of view",
    "this result is of absolutely high interest , indeed , the main issue we arise in this paper is that of understanding the influence of lateral displacements on the typical time needed by a particle to cross a pipe .",
    "future investigation will be needed to understand deviations from the average particle behavior . in this perspective",
    "the residence time seems to be a very useful observable and its distribution will be the key object of our future study .",
    "the paper is structured in the following fashion : we describe the dynamics of our stochastic lattice model in section  [ s : modello ] .",
    "section  [ s : mf ] is concerned primarily with the derivation of the mean field equations governing the macroscopic evolution of the density . in the same section we study the stationary mean field behavior , the thermalization time of the system ( i.e. the time that the system takes to reach the steady state ) as well as the numerical testing of the accuracy of the mean field prediction of the stationary density profile . in section  [ s : bd ] we make the direct analogy between our scenario and a biased birth and death model for which we can calculate explicitly the unique invariant measure and the use this object to obtain analytical lower and upper bounds on the residence time for three distinct physically relevant scenarios , viz .",
    "( i ) a homogeneous case , ( ii ) a linear case , ( iii ) a totally asymmetric case .",
    "the core of the paper is section  [ s : res ] and section  [ s : res - num ] .",
    "herein we use inspiration from the handling of the biased birth and death model to get approximate analytical bounds on the residence time for our problem for selected parameter regimes .",
    "we also setup a purely mean field macroscopic computation yielding a prediction of the residence time which is fully discussed in the last two sections.finally , we explore numerically the residence time for all parameter regimes and compare the results with the derived analytical bounds .",

    "it is important to note that in the cases @xmath256 and @xmath260 , the initial configuration of the system has been chosen by populating the system by putting particles with probability @xmath261 . indeed , by starting the system with all the sites empty ,",

    "we shall notice that the match between theory and experiment , even if qualitatively correct , it becomes progressively worse with increasing @xmath47 .",

    "the fact that the residence time decreases with the drift and increases with the horizontal displacement probability is completely reasonable .",

    "it is remarkable the fact that even the approximated expression ( which in the case @xmath207 reduces to ) gives a perfect estimate of the residence time .",

    "[ f : res - el ] , the residence time in the case @xmath47 has been plotted as a function of the length @xmath200 of the strip for different values of the drift and for @xmath267 .",
    "it is remarkable to note the striking match between theory and simulation .",
    "in particular the fact that the behavior is linear ( ballistic ) for @xmath220 and quadratic ( diffusive ) for @xmath83 , see the theoretical discussion in section  [ s : scaling ] , is confirmed by the numerical experiment .",
    "this is the case of totally asymmetric simple exclusion rule along the vertical direction . here",
    ", particles can never jump upwards .",
    "we show that , for this scenario , the theoretical predictions of the residence time based on both the birth and death analogy and the mean field computation discussed in section  [ s : res ] agree perfectly with the numerical results .",
    "we show three pictures : the dependence of the residence time on the horizontal displacement probability @xmath211 ( figure  [ f : res - ph-100-dr1 ] ) , the dependence on the bottom boundary density @xmath47 ( figure  [ f : res - rd-100-dr1 ] ) , and , finally , the dependence on the length of the strip @xmath200 ( figure  [ f : res - el - dr1 ] ) .",
    "we do not repeat the discussion in detail .",
    "we just mention that the linearity of the residence time with respect to the length of the strip is confirmed by the experimental data and refer the reader to the caption of the pictures for more specific comments .",
    "we discuss now the case of a symmetric simple exclusion rule along the vertical direction .",
    "as we already mentioned at the beginning of this section , in this case the match between the theoretical prediction and the numerical data is only qualitatively good and quantitavely worst and worst when @xmath47 is increased .",
    "we also remark that , fixed @xmath47 , the match with the prediction based on the birth and death analogy is better at larger values of the horizontal displacement probability @xmath211 . on the other hand , fixed @xmath47 ,",
    "the match with the mean field prediction is better at smaller values of the horizontal displacement probability @xmath211 and perfect at @xmath228 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this fact is that at large @xmath47 particles accumulate at the bottom exit and , due to bouncing back of particles , fluctuations are not more negligible .",
    "for this reason our theoretical predictions , which are based only on the stationary shape of the density profile , are not anymore always efficient .",
    "we shall discuss this point also in section  [ s : caso030 ] .",
    "we show three pictures : the dependence of the residence time on the horizontal displacement probability @xmath211 ( figure  [ f : res - ph-100-dr0 ] ) , the dependence on the bottom boundary density @xmath47 ( figure  [ f : res - rd-100-dr0 ] ) , and , finally , the dependence on the length of the strip @xmath200 ( figure  [ f : res - el - dr0 ] ) .    note that in this section , since @xmath83 , the theoretical prediction based on the birth and death analogy is given by the explicit formula , whereas the mean field prediction is .",
    "the relevant comment now , see figures  [ f : res - ph-100-dr0 ] , [ f : res - el - dr0 ] , and [ f : res - ph - nuova ] , is that the match between the mean field prediction and the experiment is perfect at @xmath228 , whereas it gets worst and worst when @xmath211 is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "the birth and death analogy poorly predicts the residence time behavior @xmath228 , whereas it captures the phenomenon better and better when @xmath211 is increased .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained via two mechanisms : bouncing back and the possibility to bypass clusters of blocking particles .",
    "the former suggests that correlations become important in this regime so that a model based only on the average stationary density profile can not explain the behavior of the system . on the other hand",
    ", the latter phenomenon suggests that the effect of bouncing back is milder when the horizontal displacement probability is larger , since particles have a good chance to avoid blocking clusters .",
    "in is interesting to remark that the mean field expression for the case @xmath83 , and @xmath200 large , is given by the expression predicted by the birth and death analogy plus a term that can be ascribed the the two point correlations , see @xcite .",
    "we could then guess that the correct expression of the residence time could be the birth and death prediction plus the two point correlation contribution weighted by a function depending on @xmath211 tending to @xmath15 for @xmath268 and to @xmath53 for @xmath269 .",
    "as it has been seen in the previous section the residence time is typically an increasing function of the horizontal displacement probability .",
    "this is an obvious fact . indeed , when @xmath211 is increased particles spend a lot of time in performing horizontal jumps which are a waste of time in the run towards the bottom exit .    in this section",
    "we show that in the regime in which the bouncing back phenomenon is present a small not zero horizontal probability displacement can favour the exit of the particles .    we have performed the following simulations : @xmath191 ( as always ) , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath83 , @xmath270 as before , in all these cases",
    ", the residence time has been evaluated by averaging over all the particles entered in the system through the top boundary after the time @xmath252 , namely , at stationarity , and exited through the bottom one at a time smaller than @xmath253 .",
    "the simulations have been performed with @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "( 200,450)(0,10 ) ( 0,450 ) ( 160,450 ) ( 320,450 ) ( 0,350 ) ( 160,350 ) ( 320,350 ) ( 0,250 ) ( 160,250 ) ( 320,250 ) ( 0,150 ) ( 160,150 ) ( 320,150 ) ( 0,50 ) ( 160,50 )    -0.5 cm    in figure  [ f : res - notmono ] , the residence time is plotted as function of the horizontal displacement probability .",
    "it is remarkable the presence of a minimum at small values of @xmath211 .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as follows : in the bouncing back regime , namely , when @xmath47 is high and @xmath212 low , a particle can find a blocking cluster of particles in its way out through the bottom boundary .",
    "in such a situation , then , having a larger horizontal displacement probability can help the particle to bypass the obstacle .",
    "obviously , if @xmath211 is increased too much this effect disappears due to the time wasted by the particles in horizontal movements .",
    "we focused our attention on the study of the simplest 2d model that mimics the flow of particles in a straight pipe under the effect of different driving boundary conditions and external fields .",
    "we studied the residence time , i.e. , the typical time a particle entering the strip at stationarity from the top boundary needs to exit through the bottom one , under the assumption that particles in the strip interact only via hard  core exclusion and vertical boundaries are reflecting .",
    "we explored the dependence of the residence time on the external driving force , length of the strip , horizontal diffusion , and boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown that , in almost all the considered regimes , the mean residence time is equal to the average time needed to cross the strip by a particle performing a random walk in a background prescribed by the stationary density profile of the original model . in this way ,",
    "in particular , we recover the structure of the fluxes as well as the residence times proven mathematically in 1d in @xcite .",
    "a completely macroscopic point of view has also been alternatively adopted , i.e. a mean field computation of the residence time has been performed by connecting such a quantity to the stationary current in the system .",
    "it has been shown that also this point of view porvides very satisfactory results .",
    "this picture fails to be correct in the case in which there is a particle accumulation close to the bottom boundary ( exit ) . in this regime",
    ", we discover new effects that are consequence of the two  dimensionality of the system .",
    "the most relevant is the non  monotonic behavior in changes in the horizontal displacement probability in the bouncing back regime .",
    "a second very interesting result is the fact that in this bouncing back regime the mean field approach gives a very good prediction of the residence time in the single file ( zero horizontal displacement probability ) case . on the other hand , if the horizontal displacement probability is large ( close to one ) the mean field prediction is poor and the one based on the analogy with the birth and death model on the background of the stationary density profile yield a very good prediction .",
    "this particle accumulation situation can be realized artificially by inserting obstacles in the strip .",
    "we then expect interesting non  linear phenomena to show up .",
