    "in this article we present conjectures on the probability distribution of random paths on an @xmath2 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the geometry of the lattice is thus a cylinder with circumference @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 is even ( assumed tacitly ) the paths are closed loops with probability one .",
    "when @xmath3 is odd ( always stated explicitly ) there is an infinite path spanning the length of the cylinder .",
    "the paths are allowed to have vertices in common but can not intersect . at each vertex",
    "the paths must turn , either to the left or to the right .",
    "these two possibilities are assigned equal probability , except when the vertex has been visited before . in that case",
    "the path leaves the vertex via the unused edge .",
    "this rule prevents ( self ) intersection of paths .",
    "when a path reaches its initial edge it is considered completed .",
    "we call paths of this type osculating walks .",
    "osculating lattice paths were considered in @xcite .",
    "the conjectures are obtained from the ground state of the dense o@xmath4 loop model .",
    "the dense o@xmath5 loop model @xcite can be defined as follows .",
    "the states of this model are graphs consisting of paths of osculating walkers which together cover all the edges of the lattice .",
    "the vertices can thus be in two states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrt ] .",
    "-5mm[fig : vrt ]    to a state consisting of @xmath6 closed paths ( loops ) a weight of @xmath7 is assigned .",
    "we consider exclusively the case @xmath8 , in which all configurations have equal weight .",
    "the probability that a vertex is in a particular state is thus @xmath9 , irrespective of the states the other vertices are in .",
    "therefore , any problem involving any finite number of osculating walkers can always be reformulated as a computation of a probability in the o@xmath4 loop model .",
    "in particular the probability distribution for the path of a single osculating walker are precisely that of finding precisely that path in the o@xmath4 loop model .",
    "recently , a number of conjectures about correlations of this model have been obtained .",
    "these involve probabilities that loops intersect a horizontal cut between vertices ( henceforth referred to as a row ) in a certain prescribed way .",
    "a row intersects loops at a total of @xmath3 points .",
    "we define the connectivity state of the row as the way these @xmath3 points are connected to each other by the loops via the half cylinder below the row .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : o1 ] for an example",
    ". -4 mm     loop model on a @xmath10 cylinder , periodic in the horizontal direction and extending to infinity in both vertical directions .",
    "the connectivity state of the half cylinder below the row indicated by the dashed line is @xmath11 , above the row it is @xmath12.,scaledwidth=15.0% ]    -5 mm    following @xcite we represent connectivity states by a string of parentheses .",
    "if a point at position @xmath13 is connected to a point at position @xmath14 , then this is represented by a parenthesis at position @xmath13 matching with a parenthesis at position @xmath14 .",
    "because of periodic boundary conditions a left parenthesis does nt have to be at the left of the matching right parenthesis",
    ". the expression @xmath15 shall stand for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 delimiters have been opened and closed , and the dots symbolize an arbitrary well nested configuration . for instance @xmath18 will be denoted as @xmath19 , and @xmath20 will be denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "we will omit subscripts equal to  1 . with a superscript",
    "we will denote a repeated concatenation of a structure with itself .",
    "for instance @xmath22 stands for a sequence of @xmath17 @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "a quantity of interest is the probability distribution over the set of all connectivity states .",
    "we denote the probability of finding a row in connectivity state @xmath25 as @xmath26}$ ] . denoting the conditional probability that a row is in state @xmath27 if the row below is in state @xmath28 as @xmath29}$ ]",
    ", we can write : @xmath30}p{\\left [ c_{2}\\right]}=p{\\left [ c_{1}\\right]}\\ ] ]    for finite @xmath3 , the conditional probabilities @xmath29}$ ] can be constructed by counting how many times state @xmath27 can be obtained from @xmath28 , by continuing the lines to the next row in all possible ways . according to the probability distribution @xmath26}$ ] is the right eigenvector of the matrix @xmath29}$ ] .",
    "for @xmath3 not too large @xmath26}$ ] is thus easily obtained .",
    "computations of @xmath26}$ ] for @xmath3 up to 18 have led to several conjectures @xcite .",
    "a recent summary of these results is given in @xcite .",
    "here we review a few of these conjectures : ( i ) the connectivity with the smallest probability is @xmath31 .",
    "( ii ) the probability of any other connectivity is an integer multiple of the probability of @xmath31 .",
    "the reciprocals of @xmath32}$ ] for @xmath33 are : 2 , 10 , 140 , 5544 , 622908 , 198846076 , ... this is a well known integer sequence .",
    "it is given by the number of @xmath34 alternating sign matrices invariant under a half turn @xcite .",
    "it is thus conjectured that ( iii ) : @xmath35}={\\left [ a_{\\text{ht}}{\\left(l\\right)}\\right]}^{-1}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is given by @xcite : @xmath37 ( iv ) the event @xmath38 has the largest probability .",
    "the ratios @xmath39}\\!/p{\\left [ { \\left(\\right)}_{l/2}\\right]}$ ] for @xmath33 are : 1 , 3 , 25 , 588 , 39204 , 7422987 , ... this integer sequence is given by the number of @xmath40 alternating sign matrices invariant under a half turn @xcite , so that ( v ) : @xmath41}=\\frac{a_{\\text{ht}}{\\left(l-1\\right)}}{a_{\\text{ht}}{\\left(l\\right)}}\\ ] ] the conjectured expression for @xmath42 ( note that @xmath43 is odd ) is given by @xcite : @xmath44 many more conjectures concerning this probability distribution have been obtained , also for other boundary conditions .",
    "a connectivity state , as defined in the previous section , specifies how points are connected to each other below a certain row .",
    "this concerns only configurations on the half cylinder .",
    "a convenient way to compute probabilities at a row on the complete cylinder is to consider separately the connectivity states on both half spaces below and above the row .",
    "we define the bulk connectivity at a certain row as the pair @xmath45 , where @xmath27 @xmath46 is the connectivity state below ( above ) the row .",
    "the fact that all loop configurations are equally likely in the o@xmath4 loop model implies that the probability @xmath47 of having the bulk connectivity @xmath45 factorizes : @xmath48}=p{\\left [ c_{1}\\right]}p{\\left [ c_{2}\\right]}\\ ] ] the probability that a row is intersected by a loop in a certain way directly translates to the probability that a single osculating walker intersects a row in that way .",
    "we have obtained the following conjectures concerning single osculating walkers :    * the probability that an osculating walker will visit the left neighbor of the starting point is:@xmath49 * the probability that the path of an osculating walker winds round the cylinder is given as:@xmath50where @xmath51 is the number of @xmath34 alternating sign matrices @xcite , given by:@xmath52    for large @xmath3 this last probability decays as @xmath53 .",
    "so far we have only considered cylinders with even circumferences @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is odd , one has to modify the definition of the connectivity states . on the top row of a half infinite cylinder",
    "there will be one point that is not connected to any other point on the row .",
    "this point will thus be on an ",
    "loop spanning the length of the cylinder .",
    "this implies that no loop can wind round the cylinder , because any such loop must necessarily cross the open loop , an event not allowed in the o@xmath4 loop model .",
    "interestingly , we conjecture that the probability that a point on an odd @xmath3 cylinder is visited by this open loop is given by the same formula which for even @xmath3 gives the probability that a point is on a loop spanning the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "we have succeeded in guessing an exact formula for the probability @xmath54 that a face of the lattice on a cylinder of circumference @xmath3 is surrounded by @xmath1 loops .",
    "writing @xmath55 , we conjecture that @xmath56 is an integer given by : @xmath57 here the @xmath58 are the absolute values of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath34 pascal matrix : @xmath59}=\\sum_{n=0}^{l}c_{n}{\\left(l\\right)}{\\left(-x\\right)}^{n}\\ ] ] the large @xmath3 behavior of the @xmath58 is not known well enough to be able to extract the asymptotics of @xmath54 from them .",
    "the form of the asymptotics of the @xmath54 can be obtained , however , by applying coulomb gas techniques to the dense o@xmath5 loop model . on the basis of these ( non - rigorous ) methods , explained in @xcite ,",
    "it is believed @xcite that @xmath60 behaves asymptotically as : @xmath61 in this sum @xmath62 , consistent with the renormalization group prediction .",
    "it is possible to write @xmath63 as a binomial determinant as follows .",
    "observe that according to  : @xmath64    the relation @xmath65 ( see @xcite ) allows one to rewrite this as @xmath66}\\ ] ] it thus follows from that @xmath67}={{\\rm i}}^{l/2}l^{-5/48}a_{\\text{ht}}{\\left(l\\right)}^2 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{k}l^{-k/2}\\ ] ] the first few nonzero coefficients in this expansion are approximately : @xmath68 the determinant in can be interpreted in terms of cyclically symmetric plane partitions .",
    "a plane partition of an integer @xmath69 is an array of integers @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 plane partitions can be represented as a pile of unit cubes by introducing x , y , z - coordinates in @xmath74 , and placing at position @xmath75 a stack of @xmath70 cubes .",
    "a cyclically symmetric plane partition is a plane partition whose representation as a pile of cubes is invariant under a cyclic permutation of the x , y , z coordinates . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that determinants of the form @xmath76}\\ ] ] give a weighted enumeration of cyclically symmetric plane partitions in an @xmath77 box .",
    "the weight assigned to a plane partition is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of unit cubes on the main diagonal . in @xcite",
    "closed form expressions of this determinant are given and proved for the cases @xmath80 .",
    "we close by using the determinant evaluation for @xmath81 to show that the conjectured expression for @xmath54 is properly normalized .",
    "the conjecture can be written as : @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "the summand of ( [ normq ] ) , which we name @xmath84 , satisfies the recurrence : @xmath85    summing this over @xmath86 from @xmath87 to @xmath88 yields the following recurrence : @xmath89 . from   it",

    "these two possibilities are equally likely , unless the vertex has been visited before , in which case the walker leaves the vertex via the unused edge .",
