    "is usually neglected .",
    "this is not a problem , when one is interested in cross sections for stable particles , but it becomes a crucial limitation if one needs to combine them with the spin amplitudes for the decay of an almost stable ( narrow resonance ) fermion .    the complete spin amplitude for production and decay is given by the formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the projection of the _ intrinsic _ spin on the @xmath9-axis in a certain fermion rest frame ( see discussion in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , and also ref .",
    "let us call this particular fermion rest frame the spin quantization reference frame , sqrf .",
    "when , in the above formula , both production and decay spin amplitudes are obtained from feynman rules in _ the same _ calculation , with the same intermediate fermion states @xmath10 , the situation is simple  we even do not need to know very precisely the sqrfs .",
    "the above is not true in the many important practical cases such as the production of the @xmath1 lepton , t - quark and hypothetical supersymmetric particles .",
    "the reason is the following : the fermion may have many decay modes , with complicated multiparticle final states , and complicated half - phenomenological decay matrix elements , calculated and implemented separately .",
    "for instance in the case of @xmath1 decay , the tauola monte carlo @xcite represents by itself an independent computational project .",
    "in fact every one out of more than twenty decay modes of the @xmath1 represents an independent project both from the computational and from the theoretical perspective .    for these practical reasons , combining production and decay at the _ density matrix _ level , even if it seems at first more complicated , is worth an effort , because formula  ( [ combine - spin - amplitudes ] ) would lead to independent sets of spin amplitudes for distinct combinations of decay modes of unstable final - state fermions .",
    "the density matrix formalism allows for clean modularity in the calculations and in the architecture of the corresponding monte carlo event generators .",
    "the price one has to pay ( for spin effects not to be destroyed ) is that the complete combined density matrix for all final - state unstable particles must be provided by the production program with the careful definition of the corresponding sqrfs .",
    "that requires , in particular , full control of the relative phases of all production spin amplitudes .    in our paper",
    "we shall rely on massless and massive weyl spinors defined in two papers of kleiss and stirling ( ks ) @xcite .",
    "an analogous set of massless spinors is also defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . by supplementing these techniques with rules for complete control of spin quantization axes ( complex phases ) we turn them into a powerful tool for calculations of unstable half - spin fermions , useful for a monte carlo simulation of production and decay .",
    "the aim of the present work is to adapt the spin amplitude techniques to the framework established in the works @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we shall use it in the forthcoming work on exclusive coherent exponentiation @xcite .",
    "let us start with the fundamental question of defining properly the spin quantization axes ( and complex phases ) for half - spin weyl spinors .",

    "a simplest example of wick rotation is actually @xmath43 . ] .",
    "being in the sqrf makes it also legitimate to use pauli matrices for the translation of spin indices into vector indices in eq .",
    "( [ r - matrix ] ) .    in the practical calculations that implement the above methodology ,",
    "see koralb @xcite and koralz @xcite , a special _ subprogram _ tralor is available , which implements the lorentz transformation from the sqrf of each @xmath20 down to the laboratory system .",
    "it is used to transform the momenta of all @xmath20 decay products into the laboratory frame .",
    "this arrangement fully guarantees that all spin effects , including spin correlations , are properly reproduced in the monte carlo event generation .",
    "having convinced the reader that the knowledge and the proper use of the sqrf for each fermion is very important , let us look into how it is defined .",
    "the obvious choice is to employ the standard definition of spin states by jacob and wick ( jw ) @xcite , the so - called helicity states . in ref .",
    "@xcite spinors of outgoing @xmath20 ( and also of @xmath15 beams ) were defined using a variant of the jw prescription - axis was placed in the reaction plane , while in the jw prescription it is related by direct rotation ( around the axis perpendicular to the reaction plane ) to the laboratory @xmath40-axis . ] . in the jw method ,",
    "states with definite spin projection on the @xmath9-axis ( helicity states ) are defined by construction in the sqrf ; the full lorentz transformation down to the laboratory frame is used as an inherent construction element in the definition of the spin state . in koralb",
    "@xcite the jw spin quantization principle was also successfully used to define spin states of @xmath15 and @xmath20 in the presence of one photon .    on the other hand , looking at the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite it is quite clear that the jw method is well suited to lowest order @xmath44 , but that it is rather complicated to deal with already in the case @xmath45 since the orientation of sqrf systems depends on the photon direction even in the soft - photon limit .",
    "one definitely needs a better method to go beyond the single - photon case .",
    "the natural candidates are methods based on the weyl spinors , which have provend to be very successful for the evaluation of multiple photon emission spin amplitudes for massless and massive spinors .",
    "generally weyl spinors ( ws ) have their own internal definition of the sqrf , substantially different from that in the jacob - wick method .",
    "for example in the ks technique  @xcite the spin quantization axis in the rest frame of the massive fermion is related to some auxiliary light - like vector @xmath46 involved in the definition of the massive spinor .",
    "the typical definition of the spinor in the ks method involves a single `` brutal '' transformation from the reference fermion state into the state of definite mass , spin and momentum rather than the explicit `` soft '' rotation / boost method of the jw method .",
    "the problem is that in the transformation method of the ws / ks techniques the phase , and therefore the position of the @xmath39- and @xmath40-axes , is lost or undefined .",
    "this is not a great problem for most of the practical applications of the ws / ks techniques , such as the calculation of multiple photon emission spin amplitudes , which are usually done with the `` modulo phase factor '' approach anyway .",
    "this feature of ws / ks methods inhibits , however , the use of this method for unstable fermions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how to restore the knowledge of the complex phase and the sqrf for the ks massive spinors of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall repeat many definitions of refs .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "this is made necessary by the fact the central question is the control of the spinor phases , and even knowledge that this phase is zero ( in certain cases ) forms an important new result !",
    "our final answer for the problem of control of weyl spinor phases and all three axes of the sqrf is very simple  the reader should not be misled by its apparent simplicity , it is an important and new supplement of the existing ws / ks methods .",
    "for dirac spinors , wherever an explicit representation is needed , we employ the weyl representation of gamma matrices@xmath47 in the weyl representation , spinors transform under rotations around the @xmath48-th axis and boosts along the @xmath49-th axis as follows @xcite : @xmath50 we define eigenstates with definite _ massless _ four - momentum @xmath51 and chirality @xmath52 @xmath53 with the normalization condition @xmath54 the four basic _ massless _ spinors are defined in a certain primary reference frame ( prf ) , as follows : @xmath55 and they correspond to particles flying along the @xmath9-axis : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is important to remember that the relative phases in the above set of basic vectors are constrained uniquely by the following relations @xmath58 where corresponds to the vector called @xmath46 in ref .",

    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the arbitrary massless spinor of momentum @xmath65 and chirality @xmath8 is generated according to the ks method @xcite , out of the two constant basic spinors of opposite chirality ( two out of four in eq .",
    "( [ basic - spinors ] ) ) @xmath66 written explicitly , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , it looks as follows : @xmath67 the above expressions lead directly to an explicit expression for the _ inner product _ of the two massless spinors @xmath68 it is understood that the above formula is evaluated using four - momenta in the prf , see eq .",

    "spinors for the massive particle with four momentum @xmath65 ( with @xmath70 ) can also be defined using a construction similar to that in the massless case : @xmath71 as we see , in order to obtain the @xmath72-spinor for the antiparticle we have to substitute @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and this is a general rule in the following .",
    "apart from the dirac equation @xmath75 and @xmath76 the above spinors obey the following normalization and completeness relations : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the _ spin quantization vector _ ; in the fermion rest frame , it points opposite to @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 , or in other words the spin quantization axis for every fermion is _ guided _ by the single and common massless vector @xmath79 .    the definition of eq .",
    "( [ def - massive ] ) can be rewritten explicitly in terms of massless spinors as follows @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the light - cone projection of @xmath65 obtained with the help of the auxiliary vector @xmath79 .",
    "equation  ( [ def - massive2 ] ) immediately provides us also with the explicit _ inner product _ for the massive spinors : @xmath83 where @xmath84    for the sake of the subsequent discussion , let us also write the explicit basic massive spinors in the particular case when the fermion rest frame coincides with the prf ( in which @xmath85 ) : @xmath86 we have omitted the trivial normalization factor @xmath87 .",
    "the convention for relative phases is inherited from the underlying massless spinors ( [ phase - relations ] ) .",
    "in particular the important phase relations @xmath88    for ultrarelativistic @xmath89 , or for an almost massless fermion @xmath90 , the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath91 is negligible and the massive spinor becomes identical with the corresponding massless spinor : @xmath92 the validity of the above limits is restricted by the condition @xmath93 , i.e. they fail in the special case of @xmath65 parallel to @xmath79 and such cases have to be treated one by one , with special care . in such a case , in eq .",
    "( [ def - massive2 ] ) , the second term , proportional to mass , survives and dominates .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in the inner product of eq .",
    "( [ inner - massive ] ) .",
    "thus , we have to remember that the naive procedure of taking the massless fermion limit by means of straightforward omission of all terms proportional to mass can be dangerous and the limiting procedure has to be done very carefully .",
    "we now come to the central question of interpreting the massive fermion spinors of eq .",
    "( [ def - massive ] ) , the spin vector of eq .",
    "( [ s - vector ] ) , and finding out what the sqrf for these spinors is .",
    "the states @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent _ pure quantum mechanical _ states , which we intend to use in the feynman rules to calculate scattering matrix elements . as we see for instance from eq .",
    "( [ s - vector ] ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 have spin projections @xmath98 and @xmath99 on the vector @xmath100 in the fermion rest frame .",
    "thus the vector @xmath100 , which is _ guided _ by @xmath79 , determines the @xmath9-axis of the sqrf .",
    "this is the easy part of determining the sqrf .",
    "the more difficult question is : where are the @xmath39- and @xmath40-axes of the sqrf corresponding to @xmath96 and @xmath97 defined in eq .",
    "( [ def - massive ] ) ? is this question meaningful at all ?",
    "yes , it is meaningful because a rotation @xmath43 around the @xmath9-axis introduces a @xmath8-dependent phase in @xmath101 .",
    "in fact one possible method of finding the @xmath39- and @xmath40-axes of the sqrf is to inspect @xmath94 in the rest frame of the fermion and to adjust @xmath41 such that the relative phase of @xmath102 and @xmath103 is zero , i.e. such that the relation @xmath104 holds .",
    "this rule is , however , not very practical  we would like to have at our disposal more practical , easy to apply , rules , which determine the position of the same @xmath39- and @xmath40-axes of the sqrf for both ( @xmath105 ) spinors defined in eq .",
    "( [ def - massive ] ) .    the rules for determining all three spin quantization axes for @xmath94 and @xmath95 of eq .",

    "we call the above rules the global positioning of spin scheme or in short the gps rules , and we shall call the gps frame the sqrf determined by the gps rules .",
    "we give here the formal proofs of the above rules .",
    "_ proof : _ since all massive spinors are defined in terms of two basic massless spinors @xmath108 and @xmath109 , it is sufficient to consider underlying massless spinors and to prove that after transforming them from the prf to the gps frame they look the same as in eq .",

    "the above implies that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a real constant , and therefore @xmath116 the above completes the proof because we may exploit the relation @xmath117 see eq .",

    "the difference is however clear : in the jw method , the transformation from the laboratory frame to the sqrf is the essence and the starting point of the method  it is tied up to the fermion four - momentum in the laboratory system , and the axes of that frame . in the gps method the sqrf / gps frame and the lorentz transformation from the laboratory to the sqrf / gps frame are deduced with the help of the `` backward engineering '' procedure guided by the auxiliary vectors @xmath79 and @xmath59 ( common to all fermions ) , without any direct reference to the laboratory system .",
