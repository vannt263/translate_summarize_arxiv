    "the rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction is an indirect exchange interaction between two localized spins induced by itinerant electrons in a host material.@xcite this effective spin interaction , being determined by the static spin susceptibility , is not only a fundamental characteristics of the host system but also finds interesting and useful applications .",
    "one of them is the long - range coupling of spins between distant quantum dots , @xcite which is needed in scalable quantum computing architectures such as the surface code @xcite built from spin qubits .",
    "@xcite in addition , the rkky interaction , enhanced by electron - electron interactions , can initiate a nuclear spin ordering that leads to striking effects such as helical nuclear magnetism at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite such a rotating magnetic field , equivalent to the presence of a uniform magnetic field and rashba spin orbit interaction ( soi ) in one - dimensional systems,@xcite is interesting for majorana fermion physics in its own right .",
    "@xcite the rkky interaction , proposed long ago for normal metals of fermi liquid type,@xcite was later extended in various ways , in particular to low - dimensional systems with rashba soi in the clean @xcite and the disordered @xcite limit , and to systems with electron - electron interactions in one @xcite and two dimensions with @xcite and without @xcite rashba soi . also , a general theorem of mermin - wagner type was recently proven for isotropic rkky systems that excludes magnetic ordering in one and two dimensions at any finite temperature but allows it in the presence of soi .",
    "@xcite    moreover , due to recent progress in magnetic nanoscale imaging,@xcite one can expect that the direct measurement of the static spin susceptibility has become within experimental reach.@xcite for this latter purpose , graphene offers the unique advantage over other materials such as gaas heterostructures in that its surface can be accessed directly on a atomistic scale by the sensing device .",
    "all this makes the spin susceptibility and the rkky interaction important quantities to study .",
    "recently , the rkky interaction in graphene has attracted considerable attention.@xcite graphene is known for its dirac - like spectrum with a linear dispersion at low energies .",
    "this linearity , however , can give rise to divergences in the expression for the spin susceptibility in momentum space @xcite and complicates the analysis compared to systems with quadratic dispersion .",
    "however , kogan recently showed that these divergences can be avoided by working in the matsubara formalism .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we consider the close relatives of graphene,@xcite namely carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) and graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , with a focus on spin orbit interaction and non - uniform magnetic fields .",
    "metallic cnts also have a linear spectrum , so for them the imaginary time approach developed in ref .",
    "is also most convenient and will be used here .",
    "analogously to graphene , we find that the static spin susceptibility changes sign , depending on whether the localized spins belong to the same sublattice or to different sublattices . @xcite",
    "no such dependence occurs for cnts in the semiconducting regime , characterized by a gap and parabolic spectrum at low fillings .",
    "the spin orbit interaction in cnts is strongly enhanced by curvature effects in comparison to flat graphene , @xcite while in gnrs strong soi - like effects can be generated by magnetic fields that oscillate or rotate in real space .",
    "@xcite such non - uniform fields can be produced for instance by periodically arranged nanomagnets .",
    "@xcite spin orbit effects break the su(2 ) spin - symmetry of the itinerant carriers and thus lead , besides the effective heisenberg interaction , to anisotropic rkky terms of moryia - dzyaloshinsky and of ising form .",
    "quite remarkably , when the fermi level is tuned close to the gap opened by the soi , we find that the isotropic and anisotropic terms become of comparable size .",
    "this has far reaching consequences for ordering in kondo lattices with rkky interaction , since this opens up the possibility to have magnetic phase transitions in low - dimensional systems at finite temperature that are tunable by electric gates .",
    "we mention that similar anisotropies have been found before for semiconductors with parabolic spectrum and with rashba soi in the clean @xcite and in the disordered @xcite limit . however , the spin orbit interactions in cnts and in gnrs are of different symmetry and thus both of these problems require a separate study , apart from the fact that the spectrum is linear .    for all itinerant regimes",
    "we consider , the rkky interaction is found to decay as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance between the localized spins , thus following the standard behavior for rkky interaction in non - interacting one - dimensional systems . @xcite",
    "[ in interacting systems , described by luttinger liquids , the decay becomes slower .",
    "@xcite ] in contrast , the overall sign as well as the spatial oscillation periods of the rkky interaction are non - generic and depend strongly on the system and the regimes considered .",
    "finally , we will also consider the dynamical spin susceptibility at finite frequency . via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    "we obtain from this the spin - dependent dynamical structure factor in position space , which describes the equilibrium correlations of two localized spins separated by a distance @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] contains different approaches to the rkky interaction including imaginary time formalism for metallic cnts with a linear spectrum and the retarded green functions in the real space formalism for semiconducting cnts . in sec . [",
    "sec : cnts ] the low energy spectrum of cnts is shortly discussed .",
    "afterwards the spin susceptibility is calculated both in the absence of the soi ( sec .",
    "[ sec : withou_soi ] ) and in the presence of the soi ( sec .",
    "[ sec : with_soi ] ) .",
    "in addition , in sec . [ sec : magnetic ] we present results for the case of a magnetic field along the nanotube axis .",
    "such a field breaks both orbital and spin degeneracy , leading to non - trivial dependence of the spin susceptibility on the chemical potential .",

    "we note that there is a principal difference between a semiconducting cnt and a semiconducting nanowire with rashba soi . in the latter",
    ", the rashba soi can be gauged away by a spin - dependent unitary transformation.@xcite in contrast , the spectrum of cnts consists of parabolas shifted along the energy axis and not along the momentum axis as in the case of semiconducting nanowires , so the soi can not be gauged away . as shown below , this leads to a less transparent dependence of the spin susceptibility on the soi compared to nanowires .",
    "in this section we calculate the spin susceptibility neglecting spin orbit interaction , so all states are two - fold degenerate in spin .",

    "the spin susceptibility is an oscillating function that decays as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance between the localized spins .",

    "these anisotropies , giving rise to ising and moriya - dzyaloshinski rkky interactions , thus open the possibility to have magnetic order in low - dimensional systems at finite temperature .",
    "@xcite    we note that , in contrast to semiconducting nanowires , the soi can not be gauged away by a unitary transformation in cnts , giving rise to a more complicated dependence of @xmath298 on the soi parameters . in the same way , a magnetic field along the cnt axis breaks both the spin and the valley degeneracy , leading to a dependence of the spin susceptibility on four different fermi wavevectors .",
    "the spin susceptibility at finite frequencies also allows us to analyze the spin noise in the system via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "in contrast to cnts with intrinsic soi , this field - generated soi can be gauged away giving rise to a simple structure of the spin susceptibility tensor.@xcite    in this work we have ignored interaction effects .",
