    "the current development of quantum information science and technology demands optimal systems serving as long - lived quantum memories , through which the quantum information carried by a quantum system with short decoherence time can be coherently transferred @xcite . in this sense a quantum channel or a quantum data bus is needed for perfect transmission of quantum states . in this article",
    ", we will demonstrate that both the quantum information storage and the quantum state transfer can be uniquely described in a universal framework .",
    "there exist some schemes @xcite concerning about quantum storage of photon states , while there are also some efforts devoted to the universal quantum storage for a qubit ( a basic two - level system ) state , which is necessary in quantum computation .",
    "for example , most recently an interesting protocol @xcite was presented to reversibly map the electronic spin state onto the collective spin state of the surrounding nuclei . because of the long decoherence time of the nuclear spins , the information stored in them can be robustly preserved .",
    "it was found that @xcite , only under two homogeneous conditions with low excitations , such many - nuclei system approximately behaves as a single mode boson to serve as an efficient quantum memory .",
    "the low excitation condition requires a ground state with all spins orientated , which can be prepared by applying a magnetic field polarizing all spins along the same direction . with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    ", one can recognize that a ferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain usually has a spontaneous magnetization , which naturally offers such a kind of ground state . in happen of ssb ,",
    "the intrinsic interaction between spins will strongly correlate with the nuclei to form the magnon , a collective mode of spin wave , even without any external magnetic field . with these considerations , wang , li , song , and sun",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of using a ferromagnetic quantum spin system , instead of the free nuclear ensemble , to serve as a robust quantum memory .",
    "a protocol was present to implement a quantum storage element for the electronic spin state in a ring array of interacting nuclei .",
    "under appropriate control of both the electron and the external magnetic field , an arbitrary quantum state of the electronic spin qubit , either pure or mixed state , can be coherently stored in the nuclear spin wave and then read out in reverse process .    on the other hand , designed for a more realistic quantum computing , a scalable architecture of quantum network",
    "should be based on the solid state system @xcite . however , the intrinsic feature of solid state based channels , such as the finiteness of the correlation length white , dagotto and the environment induced noise ( especially the low frequency noise ) may block this scalability . fortunately",
    ", analytical study shows that a spin system possessing a commensurate structure of energy spectrum matched with the corresponding parity can ensure the perfect state transfer @xcite .",
    "based on this fact , an isotropic antiferromagnetic spin ladder system can be pre - engineered as a novel robust kind of quantum data bus @xcite .",
    "because the effective coupling strength between the two spins connected to a spin ladder is inversely proportional to the distance of the two spins , the quantum information can be transferred between the two spins separated by a longer distance .",
    "another example of the near - perfect transfer of quantum information was given to illustrate an application of the theorem .",
    "the protocol of such near - perfect quantum state transfer is proposed by using a ferromagnetic heisenberg chain with uniform coupling constant , but an external parabolic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the present paper will give a broad overview of the present situation of the our investigations mentioned above on quantum state storage and quantum information coherent transfer based on quantum spin systems .",
    "we will understand the physical mechanisms and the fundamental problems behind these protocols in the view of a unified conception , the generalized quantum information storage .",
    "for the dynamic process recording and reading quantum information carried by quantum states , we first describe the idea of generalized quantum storage , which was also introduced in association with the berry s phase factorgeo .",
    "let @xmath0 be a quantum memory possessing a subspace spanned by @xmath1 which can store the quantum information of a system @xmath2 with basis vectors @xmath3 .",
    "if there exists a controlled time evolution interpolating between the initial state @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we define the usual quantum storage by using a factorized evolution of time @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 of @xmath2 into @xmath0 with the initial state @xmath9 to @xmath10 @xmath11the readout process from @xmath0 is another controlled evolution from time @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xmath14 obviously , the combination of these two processes forms a cyclic evolution that a state totally returns to the initial one .",
    "however , in the view of the decoding approach , one need not the totally returning \" to revival the information of initial state and a difference is allowed by @xmath15 unitary transformation @xmath16 @xmath17 , namely , @xmath18this is a quantum dynamic process for recording and reading , which defines a quantum storage . because the factor @xmath19 is known to be independent of the initially state , it can be easily decoded from @xmath20 by the inverse transformation of @xmath19 .     and the target subsystem @xmath21as a generalized quantum memory.,width=7 ]    we notice that the quantum storage usually relates to two quantum subsystems .",
    "we will show as follows that the quantum state transfer can be understood as a generalized quantum storage with three subsystems , the input one with the hilbert space @xmath22 , the data bus with @xmath23 and output one with @xmath21 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , the two subsystems @xmath22 and @xmath21 located at two distant locations @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "then the hilbert space of the total system can be written as @xmath26where @xmath27 can be regarded as the generalized quantum memory with the memory space spanned by @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is a robust state of the data bus and @xmath30 represents some local unitary transformations with respect to @xmath25 , which are independent of the initial state . with this notation ,",
    "the quantum state transfer indeed can be regarded as a generalized qdr .",
    "in fact , if one input a state of @xmath31 localized at @xmath24 at @xmath32 , the initial state of whole system can be written as @xmath33where @xmath34 .",
    "the quantum state transfer can be usually described as a factorized time evolution at time @xmath13 @xmath35with @xmath36 .",
    "the above equations just demonstrate that the quantum state transfer is essentially a generalized quantum memory with @xmath37 . in this sense",
    "the revisable quantum state transfer can be regarded as a general readout process .",
    "now we would like to remark on the differences between generalized quantum state storage and other two types of quantum processes , quantum teleportation and quantum copy .",
    "in fact , quantum teleportation is theoretically perfect , yielding an output state which revival the input with a fidelity @xmath38 .",
    "actually one of necessary procedure in teleportation is to measure the bell state at location @xmath24 , which will induce the collapse of wavepacket . on the other way around ,",
    "the quantum state storage process is always on time evolution without any measurement . as for quantum copy",
    "the initial state remains unchanged during its copy can be generated in a dynamic process .",
    "a robust quantum information processing based on solid state system is usually implemented in a working spaces panned by the lowest states , which are well separated from other dense spectrum of high excitations . in this sense",
    "the energy gap of the solid state system is an important factor we should take into account .",
    "the decoherence induced by the environmental noise can also destroy the robustness of quantum information processing , such as the low frequency ( e.g , @xmath39 ) noise dominating in the solid state devices .",
    "people believe that the gap of the data bus can suppress the stay of transferred state in the middle way in order to enhance the fidelity , but the large gap may result in a shorter correlation length .",
    "the relationship between correlation length and the energy gap is usually established in the system with translational symmetry .",
    "so we need to consider some modulated - coupling systems or artificially engineered irregular quantum spin systems where the strong correlation between two distant site can be realized .",
    "quantum mechanics shows that perfect state transfer is possible . to sketch our central idea ,",
    "let us first consider a single particle system with the usual spatial refection symmetry ( srs ) in the hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the spatial refection operator .",
    "the srs is implied by @xmath42=0 $ ] .",
    "now we prove that at time @xmath43 any state @xmath44 can evolve into the reflected state @xmath45 if the eigenvalues @xmath46 match the parities @xmath47 in the following way @xmath48for arbitrary positive integer @xmath49 and @xmath50here , @xmath51 is the common eigen wave function of @xmath40 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the position of the particle .",
    "we call eq .",
    "( [ spmc ] ) the spectrum - parity matching condition ( spmc ) .",
    "the proof of the above rigorous conclusion is a simple , but heuristic exercise in basic quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , for the spatial refection operator , @xmath54 . for an arbitrarily given state at @xmath55 @xmath56 , it evolves to @xmath57at time @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "then at time @xmath60 , we have @xmath61that is @xmath62this is just the central result @xcite discovered for quantum spin system that the evolution operator becomes a parity operators @xmath63 at some instant @xmath64 , that is @xmath65=\\pm p.$]from the above arguments we have a consequence that if the eigenvalues @xmath66 of a 1-d hamiltonian @xmath40 with spatial refection symmetry are odd - number spaced , i.e. @xmath67 are always odd , any initial state @xmath68 can evolve into @xmath69 at time @xmath60 . in fact , for such 1-d systems , the discrete states alternate between even and odd parities .",
    "consider the eigenvalues @xmath70 with odd - number spaced .",
    "the next nearest level must be even - number spaced , then the spmc is satisfied . obviously , the 1-d spmc is more realizable for the construction of the model hamiltonian to perform perfect state transfer .",
    "now , we can directly generalize the above analysis to many particle systems .",
    "for the quantum spin chain , one can identify the above srs as the mis with respect to the center of the quantum spin chain . as the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we write mis operation @xmath71for the wave function @xmath72 of spin chain . here , @xmath73 denotes the spin values of the n - th qubit .",
    "based on the above analysis , in principle , perfect quantum state transfer is possible in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "according to spmc , many spin systems can be pre - engineered for perfect quantum states transfer .",
    "for instance , two - site spin-@xmath74 heisenberg system is the simplest example which meets the spmc .",
    "recently , m. christandl et al matt1,matt2 proposed a @xmath75-site @xmath76 chain with an elaborately designed modulated coupling constants between two nearest neighbor sites , which ensures a perfect state transfer .",
    "it is easy to find that this model corresponds the spmc for the simplest case @xmath77 .",
    "a natural extension of the application of the theorem leads to discover other models with @xmath78 .",
    "following this idea , a new class of different models whose spectrum structures obey the spmc exactly were proposed for perfect state transfer .",
    "consider an @xmath75-site spin@xmath79 @xmath76 chain with the hamiltonian @xmath80\\]]where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are pauli matrices for the @xmath83th site , @xmath84 is the coupling strength for nearest neighbor interaction . for the open boundary condition ,",
    "this model is equivalent to the spin - less fermion model .",
    "the equivalent hamiltonian can be written as @xmath85}a_{i}^{\\dag } a_{i+1}+h.c,\\]]where @xmath86 are the fermion operators .",
    "this describes a simple hopping process in the lattice . according to the spmc",
    ", we can present different  models ( labelled by different positive integer @xmath87 ) through pre - engineering of the coupling strength as @xmath88}=\\sqrt{i\\left ( n - i\\right ) } $ ] for even @xmath89  and @xmath88}=\\sqrt{\\left ( i+2k\\right ) \\left ( n - i+2k\\right ) } $ ] for odd @xmath89 . by a straightforward calculation",
    ", one can find the k - dependent spectrum@xmath90 for @xmath91and @xmath92 @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding k - dependent eigenstates are @xmath95where the coefficients @xmath96 can be explicitly determined by the recurrence relation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is just the special case of our general model in @xmath97 . for arbitrary @xmath98",
    ", one can easily check that it meets the our spmc by a straightforward calculation .",
    "thus we can conclude that these spin systems with a set of pre - engineered couplings @xmath99}$ ] can serve as the perfect quantum channels that allow the qubit information transfer .      in real many - body systems , the dimension of hilbert space increase with the size @xmath75 exponentially .",
    "for example , @xmath75-site spin-@xmath74 system , the dimension is @xmath100 , and the symmetry of the hamiltonian can not help so much .",
    "so it is almost impossible to obtain a model to be exactly engineered . in the above arguments we just show the possibility to implement the perfect state transfer of any quantum state over arbitrary long distances in a quantum spin chain .",
    "it sheds light into the investigation of near - perfect quantum state transfer . there is a naive way that one select some special states to be transported , which is a coherent superposition of commensurate part of the whole set of eigenstates .",
    "for example , we consider a truncated gaussian wavepacket for an anharmonic oscillator with lower eigenstates to be harmonic .",
    "it is obvious that such system allows some special states to transfer with high fidelity .",
    "we can implement such approximate harmonic system in a natural spin chain without the pre - engineering of couplings , but the present of a modulated external field . another way to realize near perfect state transfer",
    "is  to achieve the entangled states and fast quantum states transfer of two spin qubits by connecting two spins to a medium which possesses a spin gap .",
    "a perturbation method , the frhlich transformation , shows that the interaction between the two spins can be mapped to the heisenberg type coupling .",
    "we sketch our idea with the model illustrated in fig .",
    "the whole quantum system we consider here consists of two qubits ( a and b ) and a @xmath101-site two - leg spin ladder . in practice",

    "are coupled with a single electron spin with strength @xmath241 , a pair of collective operators@xcite @xmath242and its conjugate @xmath243 are introduced to depict the collective excitations in ensemble of nuclei with spin @xmath240 from its polarized initial state@xmath244which denotes the saturated ferromagnetic state of nuclei ensemble .",
    "there is an intuitive argument that if the @xmath241s have different values , while the distribution is `` quasi - homogeneous '' , @xmath25 and @xmath245 can also be considered as boson operators satisfying @xmath246\\rightarrow 1 $ ] approximately .",
    "song , zhang and sun analyzed the universal applicability of this protocol in practice @xcite .",
    "it was found that only under two homogeneous conditions with low excitations , the many - nuclei system approximately behaves as a single mode boson and its excitation that can serve as an efficient quantum memory .",
    "the low excitation condition requires a ground state with all spins orientated , which can be prepared by applying a magnetic field polarizing all spins along a single direction . with the consideration of spontaneous symmetry breaking for all spins orientated ,",
    "a protocol of quantum storage element was proposed to use a ferromagnetic quantum spin system , instead of the free nuclear ensemble , to serve as a robust quantum memory .",
    "the configuration of the quantum storage element is illustrated in fig .",
    "the nuclei are arranged in a circle within a quantum dot to form a spin ring array .",
    "a single electron is just localized in the center of the ring array surrounded by the nuclei .",
    "the interaction of the nuclear spins is assumed to exist only between the nearest neighbors while the external magnetic field @xmath247 threads through the spin array",
    ". then the electron - nuclei system can be modelled by a hamiltonian @xmath248 .",
    "it contains the electronic spin hamiltonian @xmath249the nuclear spin hamiltonian @xmath250with the zeeman split and the ferromagnetic interaction @xmath251 , and the interaction between the nuclear spins and the electronic spin @xmath252here , @xmath253 ( @xmath254 ) is the lande @xmath255 factor of electron ( nuclei ) , and @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) the bohr magneton ( nuclear magneton ) .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath258 and @xmath259 represent the nuclear spin of the @xmath260-th site and the electronic spin respectively . the denominator @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) originates from the envelope normalization of the localized electron wave - function @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interactions between nuclei and electron are proportional to the envelope function of localized electron .",
    "the electronic wave function is supposed to be cylindrical symmetric , e.g. , the @xmath261-wave component .",
    "thus the coupling coefficient @xmath262 is homogenous for all the @xmath75 nuclei in the ring array .    to consider the low spin wave excitations",
    ", the discrete fourier transformation defines the bosonic operators @xmath263 in the large @xmath75 limit .",
    "then one can approximately diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ * * ] ) as @xmath264where @xmath265 is a jaynes - cummings ( jc ) type hamiltonian @xmath266then we obtain the dispersion relation for magnon or the spin wave excitation @xmath267the above results show that @xmath268 only contains the interaction of the @xmath75-th magnon with the electronic spin and the other @xmath269 magnons decouples with it . here , the frequency of the boson @xmath270 and the two level spacing @xmath271 can be modulated by the external field @xmath203 simultaneously .",
    "the process of quantum information storage can be implemented in the invariant subspace of the electronic spin and the @xmath75-th magnon .",
    "now we can describe the quantum storage protocol based on the above spin - boson model .",
    "suppose the initial state of the total system is prepared so that there is no excitation in the @xmath75 nuclei at all while the electron is in an arbitrary state @xmath272  where @xmath273 ( @xmath274 ) denotes the electronic spin up  ( down ) state .",
    "the initial state of the total system can then be written as @xmath275 in terms of @xmath276 where @xmath277 ( @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 , @xmath269 ) denotes the fock state of the other @xmath281 magnons .",
    "if we set @xmath282 , at @xmath283 , the time evolution from @xmath284 is just described as a factorized state @xmath285where @xmath286  is the storing state of the @xmath75-th magnon with @xmath287 .\\]]here , to simplify our expression , we have denoted @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 .",
    "the difference between @xmath292 and @xmath293 is only an unitary transformation independent of the stored initial state @xmath294 .",
    "so far we have discussed the ideal case with homogeneous coupling between the electron and the nuclei , that is , the coupling coefficients are the same constant @xmath231 for all the nuclear spins .",
    "however , the inhomogeneous effect of coupling coefficients has to be taken into account if what we concern is beyond the s - wave component , in which the wave function is not strictly cylindrical symmetric . in this case , the quantum decoherence induced by the so - called quantum leakage has been extensively investigated for the atomic ensemble based quantum memory @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the similar problems for the magnon based quantum memory .    for general case , @xmath295 is the envelope function of the electron at site @xmath296 . in this case , the hamiltonian contains terms other than the interaction between the spin and @xmath75-th mode boson ,",
    "that is , the inhomogeneity induced interaction @xmath297should be added in our model hamiltonian @xmath268 where @xmath298 $ ] .    for a gaussian distribution of @xmath299 ,",
    "e.g. @xmath300with width @xmath301 and @xmath302 , the corresponding inhomogeneous coupling is depicted by @xmath303fig .",
    "8 shows the magnitude of @xmath304 for different gaussian distributions of @xmath299 with different widths @xmath301 .",
    "it indicates that the modes near @xmath116 and @xmath269 have a stronger coupling with the electron .",
    "when the interaction gets more homogenous ( with larger @xmath305 ) the coupling coefficients @xmath304 for all the modes from @xmath116 to @xmath269 become smaller . when the distribution is completely homogeneous , all the couplings with the @xmath269 magnon modes vanish and then we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath268 .",
    "in the following we will adopt a rather direct method to analyze the decoherence problem of our protocol resulting from dissipation .",
    "if @xmath75 is so large that the spectrum of the quantum memory is quasi - continuous , this model is similar to the `` standard model '' of quantum dissipation for the vacuum induced spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the @xmath269 magnons will induce the quantum dissipation of the electronic spin with a decay rate@xmath306let @xmath307 be the ideal evolution governed by the expected hamiltonian @xmath268 without dissipation while the realistic evolution @xmath308 governed by the hamiltonian with dissipation .",
    "suppose the initial state of the electron is @xmath309 , we can analytically calculate the fidelity @xmath310where @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "8 shows the curve of the fidelity @xmath224 changing with time @xmath58 .",
    "we can see that the fidelity exhibits a exponential decay behavior with a sinusoidal oscillation . at the instance when we have just implemented the quantum storage process , the fidelity is about @xmath313 .",
    "therefore , the deviation from the ideal case with homogeneous couplings is very small for @xmath314 .",
    "since the ring - shape spin array with inhomogeneous coupling is just equivalent to an arbitrary heisenberg spin chain in the large @xmath75 limit , the above arguments means that an arbitrary heisenberg chain can be used for quantum storage following the same strategy addressed above if @xmath315 is small , i.e. , the inhomogeneous effect is not very strong .     in the large @xmath75 limit .",
    "the vertical line indicates the instant  @xmath316 , at which the quantum storage is just implemented . here",
    "the inset shows the decaying oscillation with details of @xmath318 in a small region near the instant @xmath316 .",
    ", width=188,height=113 ]    on the other hand , if @xmath75 is small , the spectrum of the quantum memory is discrete enough to guarantee the adiabatic elimination of the @xmath269 magnon modes , i.e. , @xmath319 for the @xmath269 magnon modes . as a consequence of this adiabatic elimination , the quantum decoherence or de - phasing can result from the mixing of different magnon modes .",
