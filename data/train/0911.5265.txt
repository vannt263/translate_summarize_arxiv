    "given a differential operator @xmath3 , say on functions , it is natural to consider smooth differential operators which locally preserve the solution space of @xmath3 .",

    "we shall say that @xmath4 is a symmetry of @xmath3 . on euclidean @xmath7-space @xmath2 with @xmath8",
    "the space of first order symmetries of the laplacian @xmath9 is finite dimensional with commutator subalgebra isomorphic to @xmath10 , the lie algebra of conformal motions of @xmath2 .",
    "second order symmetries have applications in the problem of separation of variables for the laplacian , see @xcite and references therein ; on @xmath11 the second order symmetries were classified by boyer et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "symmetries are closely related to conformal killing tensors and their generalisations , see theorem [ main ] below .",
    "such operators also play a role in physics @xcite .",
    "partly motivated by these links , eastwood has recently given a complete algebraic description of the symmetry algebra for the laplacian on @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "his treatment uses conformal geometry and in particular a treatment of the conformal laplacian due to hughston and hurd @xcite based on the classical model of the conformal @xmath7-sphere as the projective image of an indefinite quadratic variety in @xmath13 .",
    "there are close links to the fefferman - graham ambient metric @xcite , which provides a curved version of this model , and the ideas of maldacena s ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "eastwood s work was extended in @xcite , via similar techniques , where the authors found the symmetry algebra for @xmath14 on @xmath12 .    here",
    "the main result of the article is a simultaneous treatment of all powers of the laplacian on pseudo - euclidean space @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath16 equipped with a constant signature @xmath17 metric ) with @xmath18 ; we obtain an explicit construction of all symmetries and a description of the algebra these generate .",

    "( in lower dimensions a corresponding result is not to be expected as , in that case , the space of conformal killing vectors is infinite dimensional ) . as will shortly be clear , the problem is fundamentally linked to conformal geometry .",
    "thus it is natural to also formulate and treat analogous questions for the conformally invariant generalisations @xmath19 of the powers @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) on conformally flat manifolds , and we do this ; via theorem [ csymc ] and surrounding discussion we see that the algebra is again described by theorem [ algmain ] . in dimension 4",
    "the operators @xmath19 were discussed in @xcite .",
    "conformally curved versions in general dimensions ( @xmath21 if even ) are due to paneitz ( @xmath22 ) @xcite and graham - jenne - mason - sparling @xcite , and have been the subject of tremendous recent interest in both the mathematics and physics community @xcite . for convenience we shall refer to these operators as the gjms operators .",
    "although the current work is inspired by @xcite , we follow a rather different approach that is designed to be easily adapted to study the symmetries of other classes of differential operators . indeed with minor",
    "adaption our techniques also apply to the entire class of parabolic geometries .",
    "firstly , rather than work on a higher dimensional `` ambient '' manifold , we calculate directly on the @xmath7 dimensional space and use the tractor calculus of @xcite . using this machinery",
    "we construct a map which takes solutions of certain overdetermined pde ( solutions called generalised conformal killing tensors ) to differential operators which have the universality property that they are symmetries for _ any _ conformally invariant operator between irreducible bundles .",

    "the algebra of symmetries of a given order @xmath24 gjms operator @xmath19 then proceeds in two steps .",
    "the order @xmath24 determines the domain ( density ) bundle ( for @xmath19 and hence ) on which the universal symmetry operators should act . from the latter we obtain an ideal of identities satisfied by the universal symmetries ;",
    "the ideal is specific to the domain .",
    "this is the subject of theorem [ dec2can ] .",
    "a further ideal is generated by symmetries that are trivial in a sense to be made precise below , see theroem [ extra ] .",
    "the result is an explicit description in theorem [ algmain ] of the ideal , the quotient of @xmath25 by which yields the symmetry algebra of @xmath19 .",

    "that is indices refering to a frame .",
    "all manifolds , structures , functions and tensor fields will be taken to be smooth ( i.e.  to infinite order ) and all differential operators will be linear with smooth coefficients .",
