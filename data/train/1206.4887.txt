    "in the standard cosmological framework  @xcite , one assumes that on large scales , the universe is well described by a spatially homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , at least at the background level , so that its dynamics is obtained from the einstein equations for a friedmann - lematre ( fl ) metric .",
    "structure formation is then described using perturbation theory , which has proven to be successful to understand the existing observations from cosmic microwave background anisotropies to the growth rate of the large scale structure .",
    "while most of the observations are compatible with the assumption of a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales , they exhibit a clumpy distribution of matter on small scales and at late time .",
    "this is at the heart of a lively debate concerning the magnitude of the backreaction of the large scale structure on the background dynamics . while its magnitude depends on the averaging procedure  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and on the actual small scale geometry of the universe , it has been mostly estimated using perturbation theory at linear and second order either in synchronous gauge  @xcite or in newtonian gauge  @xcite ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "one important conclusion is the existence of ultraviolet divergences ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) when particular observables are calculated , with no convincing regularization schemes proposed so far .",
    "this lets open the question of the magnitude of the backreaction and its ability to explain the late time acceleration of the cosmic expansion .",
    "this is a rather controversial subject and , according to some authors @xcite the backreaction of present inhomogeneities might explain , by itself , cosmic acceleration while , according to others @xcite , the effect of inhomogeneities is totally negligible .",
    "this article lies on a very simple , and almost trivial , remark : the spatially averaged flow has no reason to be isotropic . while obvious , this fact has been hidden in the generally adopted backreaction procedure  @xcite , in which the averaged dynamics is presented in a form mimicking the friedmann dynamics so that attention has been focused on the volume averaged expansion factor and on the backreaction terms ( see below for definitions ) .",
    "late time growth of a spatial anisotropy may thus be a specific signature of backreaction .",
    "the goal of this work is thus to estimate the level of anisotropy of the averaged flow and address the following questions : ( 1 ) is the shear , which is related to the anisotropy of the hubble flow ( and thus observable ) , divergent in the ultraviolet ? ( 2 ) how is the shear magnitude related to the backreaction magnitude ? ( 3 ) can a bound on the shear on cosmological scales allow us to set a bound on the backreaction ?    to that purpose , we start by recalling the averaging procedure in   [ ii ] and propose to split the kinematical backreaction term into a term describing the anisotropy of the flow and a genuine backreaction term . under that form",
    "the averaged dynamics of any spatially homogeneous ( but not necessarily isotropic ) flow on a surface of homogeneity remains unchanged and the genuine backreaction term strictly vanishes .",
    "using perturbation theory , the shear is computed at lowest order in perturbation theory in ",
    "[ iii ] and then computed explicitly in   [ v ] after having discussed the choice of the matter power spectrum in   [ iv ] .",
    "we have actually used two power spectra , one motivated by observations ( with a simple analytical form allowing for an exact integration ) and another motivated by theory , relying on the initial conditions from inflation and the transfer function of the standard @xmath0cdm model , but which requires numerical integration . as we shall show the scalar shear is divergent in the ultraviolet , which raises several questions that are summarized in   [ vi ] .",
    "appendix a summarizes the main results of linear perturbation theory around a spatially euclidean homogeneous background spacetime .",
    "a detailed description of how to implement the shear average is given in appendix b , and the normalization of the power spectra is described in appendix c.",
    "the driving idea , as first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been to rely on the 1 + 3 splitting of the universe  @xcite associated with a general reference timelike congruence @xmath1 that defines a foliation of spacetime .",
    "the choice of this congruence is often referred to as a choice of observers .",

    "in such a situation , and as it was assumed in the original work by buchert  @xcite , one can pick up a foliation defined by a geodesic congruence @xmath19 which accidentally coincides with the four - velocity @xmath20 of comoving observers , i.e. @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite is to allow for the spatial averaging of scalar quantities and to derive an averaged dynamical flow by averaging the generalized friedmann and raychaudhuri equations to get @xmath36 where one has defined the kinematical backreaction term as @xmath37 and @xmath38 refers to the spatial average of the curvature of the 3-dimensional metric induced on the hypersurfaces .",
    "since the average of the continuity equation , @xmath39 , leads to @xmath40 one easily concludes that @xmath41 .    this formalism has been extended to allow for arbitrary coordinate systems  @xcite and any choice of gauge and slicing  @xcite .      in the form  ( [ e.backreac1][e.backreac2 ] )",
    ", the dynamics of the averaged scale factor mimics the friedmann equations for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic fl spacetime .",
    "the dynamics of the averaged flow depends strongly on the backreaction terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these terms are related each other by the integrability condition @xmath44 but there remains a freedom in the determination of @xmath42 . to this purpose , the value of @xmath42 has been computed using perturbation theories in many studies ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) , and many alternative models have been proposed ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the form  ( [ e.backreac1][e.backreac2 ] ) and the splitting of the backreaction terms is highly suggestive since they match a friedmann form .",
    "it is however intuitively clear that the average of any spatially homogeneous flow should let this flow unchanged . in particular",
    ", we would like the kinematical backreaction term to strictly vanish when averaging any spatially homogeneous flow .",
    "to that purpose , we rewrite the system  ( [ e.backreac1][e.backreac2 ] ) in the strictly equivalent form @xmath45 defining a new kinematical backreaction term as @xmath46 under this form , the averaged flow is described by a set of equations that mimics the flow of comoving observers in a spatially homegenous universe , but not necessarily isotropic spacetime .",
    "it follows that the backreaction term @xmath47 is generated only by inhomogeneities and is thus related to deviations from local homogeneity .",
    "indeed , it is clear that for a fl universe , @xmath48 while when averaging any bianchi universe , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in both cases",
    "the set of equations ( [ e.backreac1bis][e.backreac2bis ] ) has the homogeneous form , while the standard kinematical backreaction @xmath42 is different from zero for the later case despite no genuine backreaction .",
    "with such a rewriting it is possible to compare the backreaction terms induced by the perturbations on a background flow with either fl or bianchi symmetry  @xcite but more important to compare the magnitude of the anisotropy of the averaged flow with the true backreaction term .",
    "the averaging of spatially anisotropic cosmological models has been considered in ref .",
    "our definition of @xmath47 , and the split of the kinematical backreaction term in @xmath47 and @xmath51 , differs from their proposal .",
    "we emphasize that their definition relies on the use of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 itself is not well - defined , contrary to @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , considering a fl background , the lowest order for @xmath54 will be quadratic in first order perturbations ( see appendix a and next section ) which are stochastic fields and one needs to define properly the square root of these stochastic fields before ensemble average . indeed , starting with a non - isotropic background",
    ", one can define @xmath53 as @xmath55 at lowest order and then perform a perturbative expansion . given this ,",
    "we prefer to adopt a more straightforward and pedestrian rewriting of the standard equation .",

    "we start from a fl universe with perturbations in order to compute @xmath51 . in such an approach",
    ", one needs to be reminded that the perturbations are stochastic fields , usually with gaussian initial conditions .",
    "it follows that the spatially averaged quantities are also stochastic quantities .",
    "taking @xmath56 as a function of the perturbations and @xmath57 as its average on a spatial domain , then , from a theoretical point of view , we only have access to the distribution of @xmath57 , that is to @xmath58 , which is the ensemble average of @xmath57 . in this section ,",
    "we compute the lowest contribution to the shear in perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbation equations at linear order are summarized in   [ iii.b ] and the shear",
    "is explicitly computed in   [ iii.c ] .      for simplicity",
    ", we consider a spatially euclidean friedmann - lematre universe so that the late time dynamics is dictated only by the pressureless matter and the cosmological constant with density parameters @xmath59 that satisfy @xmath60 .",
    "the friedmann equation then takes the usual form @xmath61 the solution of which is @xmath62 the normalization to the hubble constant today , @xmath63 , implies that @xmath64 so that the redshift is given by @xmath65      for our concern , it will be sufficient to assume that our universe can be described by a spatially homogeneous and isotropic fl spacetime with perturbations .",

    "we have thus focused our analysis of the shear in order to quantify the expected deviation from isotropy that arises from the backreaction of large scale structure .    for that purpose , we have used the averaging procedure designed in ref .",
    "@xcite but rewritten in a way that makes explicit the anisotropy of the averaged flow . under this new form",
    "the kinematical backreaction term arises only from inhomogeneities and , e.g. , the spatial average of a bianchi dynamics remains unchanged , so that it is physically more sound ( in particular , one can think of comparing the backreaction that arises from similar inhomogeneities with respect to different background homogeneous flows ) . in order to evaluate the order of magnitude of the scalar anisotropy @xmath168 , it is sufficient to work at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "+ concerning the questions that were raised in the introduction , we can give the following answers .",
    "first , @xmath203 diverges in the ultraviolet and it must be regularized by the introduction of a uv cut - off @xmath145 ; see eqs .",
    "( [ shearv1 ] ) and  ( [ shearv2 ] ) or eqs .",
    "( [ sigma2_k_general2_with_cutoff ] ) and  ( [ sigma2_k_general2_with_window ] ) .",
    "such uv divergence has a large impact on the final result and the same problem of uv divergent terms is also found in other approaches ( e.g. the one based on the all - sky average ( monopole ) of the redshift - distance relation , obtained from the kristan and sachs approach @xcite , as clearly shown in ref .",
    "the question regarding this cut - off is central in the backreaction debate . indeed , since we have used linear perturbation theory , it is probably not safe to extrapolate at scales larger than @xmath204 without taking into account the non - linear effects which turn on beyond such scales .",
    "this divergence is particulary problematic for the shear , since this is related to an anisotropy of the hubble flow and can thus , in principle , be observed .",
    "we see that its amplitude can shift from 2% to 37% when @xmath145 varies from @xmath198 to @xmath170 for the standard @xmath0cdm model ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and it varies with the value of the cosmological constant ( see fig . 6 ) .    since the amplitude of some backreaction effects can also depend on @xmath145 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a constraint of the scalar shear can be translated into a constraint on the backreaction , hence possibly resolving the debate of the ability for these effects to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the average friedmann equation  ( [ e.backreac1bis ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath205 .",
    "it is well - known ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath206 , which usually characterizes the backreaction , is not uv divergent , while both @xmath207 and @xmath208 are .",
    "this arises from the fact that the divergence does not appear in @xmath31 while it does in both @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "this shows trivially that @xmath211 for large @xmath145 so that the amplitude of the anisotropy and kinematical backreaction are related in this regime .",
    "let us stress that there is no total agreement about the physical meaning of the buchert procedure and its connection to observable quantities .",
    "for example , quantities connected to spatial averages are not , strictly speaking , observable because we only have observational access to our past light - cone ( see , for example , ref .",
    "on the other hand , if we take seriously these equations we have an important observational impact via the averaged shear .",
    "it is then important to realize that the anisotropy arising from the averaged flow , as a specific signature of backreaction , may allow us to discriminate with dark energy models  @xcite ( unless dark energy has an anisotropic stress , as e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or modification of general relativity .",
    "we argue that this is a key quantity to discriminate these models as a possible explanation of the late time acceleration of the cosmic expansion .",
    "we have shown that its amplitude is fixed by the cosmological parameters and the matter power spectrum , and not as an initial condition as e.g. for bianchi universes .",
    "its time evolution is also different from the homogeneous shear of a bianchi universe since it increases with time to eventually reach a maximum . in an effective way",
    ", this can indeed be rephrased as a dark energy anisotropic stress , the time evolution of which is determined by the growth of the structures .",
    "we have shown that for a standard @xmath0cdm background dynamics , @xmath168 peaks between 2 and 37% at a redshift of order 0.5 .",
    "any bound on the anisotropy of the hubble flow can probably set constraints on backreaction effects .",
    "in particular , it shows explicitly that a cut - off scales larger than or of the order of @xmath212 induces too strong an anisotropy .",
    "indeed , it does not make sense to derive the value of a cut - off from observation , but it emphasizes , again , the necessity to design a proper regularization scheme for this mechanism to be fully predictive .",
    "an anisotropy with that amplitude can potentially be observable , in particular with weak lensing experiment such as euclid  @xcite via the @xmath72-modes  @xcite .    from a technical point of view",
    ", we have used two matter power spectra .",
    "one is more realistic while the second has a more simple form .",
    "interestingly , we have shown that they give similar results as long as @xmath145 remains small .",
    "this is thus a excellent tool that allows us to make analytical estimates and , for instance , to derive scalings and order of magnitude without numerical integrations of the spectrum .    our analysis , while restricted to simple power spectra and linear perturbation theory , points toward a specific signature of backreaction",
    "this may offer the possibility to constrain this class of explanations for the dark energy .",

    "let us stress that if we neglect vector and tensor perturbations at first order ( considering their contribution negligible with respect to the scalar one ) then there will be no vector or tensor contributions in @xmath235 .",
    "in fact , genuine second order vector and tensor contributions , that are always sourced by first order scalar perturbations , are also not present in @xmath235 as we have seen .",
    "we can note that this is also a consequence of a general property valid for any scalar field at any order in perturbation theory .",
    "namely , at a given order @xmath236 the vectors @xmath237 and @xmath238 , and the tensor @xmath239 can appear in a scalar quantity only as @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 or @xmath243 , but since the vectors and the tensors are , respectively , transverse , and traceless and transverse to all order , these terms are always identically zero .",

    "@xcite , the spatial average prescription described in eq .",
    "( [ averagepb ] ) can be generalized to take a manifestly gauge invariant form , which allows the use of different gauges independently of the choice of the spacelike hypersurface on which the average is performed .",
    "for instance , the average of a scalar quantity @xmath244 on a hypersurface @xmath245 can be obtained from the four - dimensional integral @xmath246 here @xmath247 is the determinant of the 4-metric @xmath248 and the window function is given by @xmath249 \\tilde{w}_\\omega(t,{\\bm x}),\\ ] ] where @xmath250 defines the 3-dimensional domain @xmath25 inside the 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath245 .",

    "this corresponds to a redefinition of the time coordinate , @xmath256 with @xmath257 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath258 is the time @xmath259 at which @xmath260 takes the constant values @xmath4 .",
    "the suffix @xmath261 on the integral recalls that we are averaging a scalar quantity @xmath24 on a section of the three - dimensional hypersurface @xmath261 , where the given scalar field @xmath262 takes the constant values @xmath4 .    on the other hand , for the aim of the paper , the simpler definition given by eq .",
    "( [ averagepb ] ) is sufficient to average the scalar shear without running into problems related to the gauge choice .",
    "in fact , a double simplification appears as a consequence of the fact that the scalar shear is non - vanishing only from the second order on ( see eqs.([shear0and1mt ] ) and ( [ sigma2order2generalmt ] ) ) .",
    "first , performing the computations only up to second order , we can take @xmath263 , and the particular form of the perturbations of the spatial metric is irrelevant .",
    "second , the shear will be gauge invariant up to this second order , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath264 .",
    "therefore there is no difference between the particular bar gauge and any other gauge for such a quantity . as a final result",
    ", we obtain that , up to second order in perturbation theory , the average of the shear over a 3-dimensional domain @xmath25 can be simply written as @xmath265 considering now the gauge introduced in eq .",

    "we denote this additional average by an over - bar . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath72 is statistically homogeneous then @xmath269 the ensemble average of @xmath132 is thus given by @xmath270 and it will be independent from the domain of integration @xmath25 , whatever is the window function which defines such domain of integration .",
    "this is a general property for the ensemble average of the spatial average of a second order contribution .",
    "however , it is worth underlining that the result ( [ b9 ] ) holds only because the higher contributions arising from the ensemble average , and involving also the induced metric ( which is also present in the definition of @xmath27 ) , will be at least fourth order in perturbation theory .",
    "for any density field @xmath100 , that can be decomposed in fourier modes as @xmath272 and any window function @xmath273 of typical width @xmath274 , the smoothed density field is given by @xmath275 decomposing the window function in fourier modes @xmath276 , as in eq .",
