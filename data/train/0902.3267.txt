    "the measurement of the total @xmath4 cross section constitutes a major part of the top physics program at a future @xmath5 international linear collider ( ilc ) . due to the large top quark mass and the large width @xmath6 , non perturbative effects",
    "are strongly suppressed at energies around the threshold .",
    "therefore it is possible to determine top quark properties like the mass @xmath7 and the width @xmath8 , but also the strong coupling @xmath9 with high precision . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that an uncertainty of below 100 mev can be obtained for @xmath7 from a threshold scan of the cross section .",
    "the feasibility of such high - precision measurements requires a theory prediction of the total cross section @xmath10 with high accuracy ( preferably @xmath11 ) .",
    "the study of @xmath12 threshold production is performed in the framework of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite which separates the hard and soft scales involved in the process .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculation  @xcite turned out to be as large as the nlo one .",
    "only the ( partial ) nnnlo  @xcite results show a good convergence of the perturbative expansion and a strong reduction of the scale dependence from nnlo to nnnlo can be observed .",
    "the remaining uncertainty turns out to be of the order of 10% .",
    "a similar value is obtained from the approach based on the resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms which have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to reach a theory goal of @xmath11",
    "it is necessary to include in the prediction next to the one - loop electroweak corrections , which are known since quite some time  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , also higher order effects .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath13 corrections has been started in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the two - loop mixed electroweak and qcd corrections to the matching coefficient of the vector current has been computed due to a higgs or @xmath14 boson exchange in addition to a gluon . in these proceedings the calculation of @xmath15 for the two - loop vertex diagrams mediated by a @xmath3 boson and gluon exchange is summarised  @xcite .",
    "this result completes the vertex corrections of order @xmath16  a building block for the top quark production cross section . assuming the ( numerically well justified ) power counting @xmath17 one can see that these corrections are formally of nnnlo .    in order to complete the matching corrections of order @xmath16 also the two - loop box diagrams contributing to @xmath18",
    "have to be considered .",
    "actually , only the proper combination of the box , vertex and self - energy contributions ( the latter can , e.g. , be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) forms a gauge independent set .",
    "within the framework of nrqcd  @xcite the total cross section for the top quark production can be cast in the form @xmath19\\ , , \\label{eq : xsection}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the square of the centre - of - mass energy and @xmath21 is the cross section normalised to @xmath22 . for illustration",
    "we consider in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsection ] ) left - landed positrons and right - handed electrons . for @xmath23 in the initial state a similar expression is obtained by replacing r by l in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsection ] ) .",
    "note that in the sm the initial states @xmath24 and @xmath25 are suppressed by a factor @xmath26 and are thus negligible .",
    "we denote @xmath27 and @xmath28 by helicity amplitudes which absorb the matching coefficients representing the effective coupling of the effective operators .",
    "they take care of the hard part of the reaction .",
    "the first subscript of @xmath29 refers to helicity of the electron , and the second one to the vector ( @xmath30 ) or axial - vector coupling ( @xmath31 ) of the gauge bosons to the top quark current .",
    "the bound - state dynamics is contained in the so - called hadronic part which is denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsection ] ) .    in the cross section formula ( [ eq : xsection ] ) `` @xmath34 '' refers to those cuts which correspond to the @xmath35 final state .",
    "this means that we have to select special cuts which correspond to the final state we are interested in .",
    "this requires a dedicated study incorporating the experimental setup . for the one - loop electroweak correction",
    "this treatment was performed in @xcite . in",
    "@xcite we did not pursue this problem further .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 requires to integrate out the low - energy modes of qcd , the soft , potential and ultrasoft gluons contained in nrqcd @xcite . for the top quark system",
    "this can be done perturbatively . in a first step one",
    "integrates out the soft and potential gluons which results in the effective field theory potential nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "the    r0.5        corresponding lagrangian is known to nnnlo  @xcite . to integrate out nonrelativistic top and anti - top quark fields",
    "the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory can be applied as was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite and performed to nnnlo for @xmath32 and @xmath33 in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively . integrating out the ultrasoft gluon was completed recently in ref .",

    "we refer to the original papers and references cited therein ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in these proceedings",
    "we report on a recent publication , where corrections of @xmath15 to @xmath36 were computed .",
    "some sample vertex diagrams which have to be evaluated at threshold are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::samplefds ] .",
    "let us mention that the corresponding two - loop qcd corrections have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and the three - loop corrections induced by a light quark loop in ref .",
    "the two - loop diagrams which have to be evaluated are generated with qgraf  @xcite and further processed with q2e and exp  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the integrals is performed with the program crusher  @xcite which implements the laporta algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we arrive at 29 master integrals ( mi ) .",
    "some mis factorise into one - loop integrals or contain only one dimensionful scale .",
    "most of these integrals are available in the literature and can , e.g. , be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two - scale mis are evaluated via an expansion in @xmath37 . a promising method to obtain the results",
    "is based on differential equations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) which provide the expansion in an automatic way once the initial conditions are specified . with the help of the ansatz @xmath38",
    "the differential equations can be expanded in @xmath39 and @xmath40 . as a result",
    "they reduce to algebraic equations for the coefficients @xmath41 , which can be solved trivially . in every order in @xmath39",
    "there is one constant @xmath41 which can not be determined with this procedure .",
    "it is obtained from the initial condition at @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , we could not get analytic results for five coefficients in the @xmath39-expansion of four mis at @xmath42 .",
    "we calculated these coefficients using the mellin - barnes method ( see , e.g. , ref  @xcite ) where we used the program packages ambre  @xcite and mb  @xcite .",
    "r0.35        the mellin - barnes representation for a given integral is not unique .",
    "in particular it might happen that the convergence of the resulting numerical integration turns out to be good in one case whereas a poor convergence is observed in other cases .",
    "the crucial quantity in this respect is the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath43 function for large imaginary part which is given by @xmath44 where the first two exponential factors lead to oscillations .",
    "let us discuss this in more detail for the mellin - barnes representation of one of the mis , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig::mi ] : @xmath45 ^ 2 } { \\gamma ( -3     \\epsilon - z_1 + 2 )     \\gamma ( -2 \\epsilon - z_1 + 2 ) \\gamma ( -4 \\epsilon-2     z_2 + 2)}\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\hspace{-0em}\\times \\gamma   ( -4 \\epsilon - z_1-z_2 + 2 ) \\gamma ( z_1-z_2 ) \\gamma   ( \\epsilon+z_2 ) \\gamma ( 2 \\epsilon+z_2 )   \\ , ,   \\label{eq::mb45}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and the contour of integration is chosen in such a way that the poles of the @xmath43 functions with @xmath47 are separated from the poles of the @xmath43 functions with @xmath48 . using the package mb we can expand the integrand in @xmath39 . for the finite contribution",
    "this leads to a sum of an analytic part , a one - dimensional mellin - barnes integral and a two - dimensional one .",
    "the latter correspond to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq::mb45 ] ) for @xmath49 .",
    "if we insert in this expression the asymptotic behaviour for the @xmath43 functions as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq::asymgamma ] ) one observes that the integrand of the two - dimensional integral falls off exponentially , except for @xmath50 .",
    "the exponential factor in the integrand of ( [ eq::mb45 ] ) increases exponentially . ] on this line the drop - off only shows a power - law behaviour which is dictated by the last factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq::asymgamma ] ) . in our particular case",
    "the drop - off turns out to be extremely slow for the integration contour chosen by mb which corresponds to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus it is hard to get an accurate result by the numerical integration since a highly oscillating functions has to be integrated .",
    "a closer look to the fall - off behaviour in eq .",
    "( [ eq::asymgamma ] ) shows that it is possible to improve the drop - off for im@xmath53 by taking residues of the integrand in @xmath54 and thus shifting the integration contour for @xmath54 more and more to positive values for re@xmath55 . in this way",
    "the integrand becomes well - behaved and can be integrated numerically with sufficiently high precision .",
    "it has already been pointed out in  @xcite that for certain kinematical configurations the mellin - barnes integrals exhibit poor convergence behaviour .",
    "we have shown that at least for the threshold integrals needed in our calculation , it is possible to choose the integration paths in a way to make the numerical integration possible .",
    "one may hope that with the approach described here it will turn out to be possible to use mellin - barnes integration for other troublesome integrals , too .",
    "the other integrals which were solved using the mellin - barnes method show similar properties than the mi above . in all cases it is possible to end up with integrals which could be integrated numerically .",
    "the accuracy for the finite part of these integrals is sufficient to obtain the final result with four significant digits .",
    "note that contrary to the default settings of mb we do not use vegas for the multidimensional numerical integrations .",
    "instead we use divonne which is available from the cuba library  @xcite .",
    "for the integrals we have considered it leads to more accurate results using less cpu time .",
    "we have performed an independent check of the initial conditions for all the mis employing the method of sector decomposition .",
    "in particular we used the program fiesta  @xcite .",
    "the hard part of the cross section in  ( [ eq : xsection ] ) at tree level is given by @xmath56 where the @xmath57 is the coupling of a fermion ( @xmath58 ) with helicity @xmath59 to the @xmath14 boson  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath60 the contribution of the sum of all one - particle - irreducible diagrams to the @xmath61 vertex and parametrise the radiative corrections in the form @xmath62 where the hat denotes renormalised quantities and the subscripts @xmath63 indicate corrections of @xmath64 . substituting @xmath65 for the @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamp ] ) and retaining the relevant orders in the electroweak and strong couplings leads to the corrections to the helicity amplitudes , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we further decompose @xmath65 ( and similarly the quantities on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq::ghat ] ) ) according to the contributions from the higgs , @xmath14 and @xmath3 boson exchanges : @xmath69 the results for the electroweak corrections read  @xcite @xmath70 one observes quite small corrections from the @xmath3 and @xmath14 boson induced contributions . from eq .",
    "( [ eq::numg ] ) one can read off that relatively big one - loop effects are obtained for light higgs boson masses .",
    "however , there is a strong cancellation between the one- and two - loop terms resulting in corrections which have the same size as the sum of the one- and two - loop contributions of the @xmath3 and @xmath14 boson diagrams . in general moderate effects",
    "are observed suggesting that in the electroweak sector perturbation theory works well , which is in contrast to the pure qcd corrections .",
    "let us in the end mention that @xmath71 leads to a correction of @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
