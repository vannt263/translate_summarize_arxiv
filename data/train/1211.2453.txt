    "how do rocky planets form ? is earth normal ? are there extrasolar planetesimals with exotic compositions ?",
    "although such questions have received an enormous amount of theoretical attention @xcite , there are relatively few observational constraints",
    ". studies of externally - polluted white dwarfs provide an opportunity to address these topics .    amassed evidence @xcite",
    "has provided compelling support for the scenario that the heavy elements in white dwarfs with @xmath0 @xmath1 20,000 k usually derive from rocky planetesimals .",
    "the widely accepted model is that an asteroid s orbit is perturbed so that it passes within the white dwarf s tidal radius where it is destroyed , a circumstellar disk is formed , and eventually this material is accreted onto the host star @xcite .",
    "consequently , spectroscopic determination of the atmospheric abundances in externally - polluted white dwarfs is a powerful tool to measure the elemental compositions of extrasolar minor planets @xcite .",
    "this topic was comprehensively discussed in @xcite and more recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "recent observational progress in the study of externally - polluted white dwarfs has been substantial .",
    "largely by using the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", 30 white dwarfs with dust disks that lie within the star s tidal radius have been identified @xcite .",
    "the first measurement of all major elements in a polluted white dwarf was performed by @xcite , and , as reported in more detail below , results for more stars have been announced .",
    "characteristic minimum masses of the accreted parent bodies of the best studied systems require asteroids with diameters greater than 100 km , likely remnant planetesimals from the era of planet formation .",
    "these data for externally - polluted white dwarfs therefore uniquely enable detailed assessment of models for the formation and evolution of rocky planets .    in conventional planet formation models ,",
    "the condensation of gas into solids is controlled by the gas temperature , pressure and composition in the protoplanetary disk midplane .",
    "for example , earth is largely composed of material that condenses at @xmath21100 k @xcite ; it is presumed that this result reflects the local disk physical conditions at @xmath21 au from the sun at the time when the first planetesimals that grew into earth were formed @xcite .",
    "similarly , the existence of icy bodies in the outer solar system is explained by their formation beyond a snow line , the region where h@xmath3o condenses into ice and contributes as much as 50% to the mass of a newly - formed planetesimal @xcite .",
    "there is now evidence from externally - polluted white dwarfs that these familiar models for thermal segregation in the solar system s protoplanetary disk can be extrapolated to extrasolar planetary systems to explain the measured volatile - element compositions of extrasolar planetesimals .",
    "that is , formation interior to a snow line can explain the results of @xcite that ice comprised less than 1% of the mass of the parent body accreted onto j073842.56 + 183509.06 and @xcite that h@xmath3o was less than 1% of the mass accreted onto an ensemble of nearby externally - polluted white dwarfs .",
    "additionally , carbon within extrasolar planetesimals is often deficient by at least a factor of ten compared to its  cosmic \" abundance @xcite .",
    "therefore interstellar grains containing carbon that entered the inner protoplanetary disks must have been vaporized where gas temperatures likely exceeded 500 k @xcite .",
    "@xcite have considered standard models for protoplanetary disks and proposed that there is a zone with a temperature near 1400 k where only the most refractory elements condense to form long - lived planetesimals .",
    "local remnants of such a process might be the calcium aluminum inclusions ( cais ) in meteorites that may have been produced in the inner solar system @xcite when the disk was no older than 3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 yr @xcite and perhaps as young as 2 @xmath4 10@xmath6 yr @xcite . @xcite have proposed that some main belt asteroids with high fractions of refractory elements may be composed of blends of exceptionally refractory planetesimals that were formed in the inner solar system and scattered outwards to collide and partially merge with an ambient object . although the magnitude of such refractory - rich contamination is uncertain @xcite , perhaps similar radial mixing measurably occurred in extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "there are at least two ways by which we might infer the long - lived existence of refractory - dominated planetesimals .",
    "first , most obviously , such an object might be accreted intact by a white dwarf and the heavy elements in the atmosphere of the star would be largely al , ca and o. second , more subtly , accreted material might be a blend of a more  normal \" earth - like composition with a refractory - dominated planetesimal that was scattered outwards from its original orbit @xcite .",
    "this blending may occur either by the collision of two asteroids and a subsequent partial or complete merging , or simply by two different asteroids being independently tidally - disrupted , but from our perspective , being simultaneously accreted by an externally - polluted white dwarf .    in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize relevant observations of externally - polluted white dwarfs . in section 3 , we describe a toy model to explain why intact refractory - dominated planetesimals have not yet been found . in section 4 , we consider the possibility that refractory - rich material in some observed polluted white dwarfs results from blending of refractory - dominated planetesimals into the observed contaminating material . in section 5",
    "we put our results in perspective and in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "ca ii 3933  is the strongest heavy - element line in the optical spectrum of polluted white dwarfs cooler than 15,000 k @xcite while mg ii 4481  and/or mg i between 3832  and 3838  often also are detected . because refractory - dominated planetesimals are predicted to be largely composed of o , ca and al , we use observed value of @xmath7(mg)/@xmath7(ca ) to determine if the white dwarf has accreted such a parent body .",
    "previously published results for 60 polluted white dwarfs with expected relative errors less than 0.5 dex are displayed in figure 1 where @xmath7(mg)/@xmath7(ca ) is plotted compared to the white dwarf s effective temperature , a measure of the star s cooling age .",
    "we also display @xmath7(mg)/@xmath7(ca ) for a representative type a cai , a value that is midway between the higher ratio measured for type b cais @xcite and the lower ratio predicted for refractory - dominated planetesimals @xcite .",
    "we see that mg is always more abundant than ca , as in bulk earth but not in cais .",
    "there is no evidence for intact extrasolar refractory - dominated planetesimals .",
    "the average values of @xmath8 @xmath7(mg)/@xmath7(ca ) and @xmath8 @xmath7(fe)/@xmath7(ca ) for the ensembles of stars plotted in figures 1 and 2 are 1.26 and 1.00 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding solar system values of these two ratios are 1.21 and 1.13 , respectively @xcite . at least on average , the relative abundances of fe , mg and ca among extrasolar planetesimals are approximately solar system - like .    because different elements gravitationally settle with different rates , the ratio of mg to ca in the star s photosphere need not measure the element ratio in the accreted parent body @xcite .",
    "the display in figure 1 is for the  instantaneous \" approximation where the observed abundance ratio directly measures the abundance ratio in the parent body .",
    "if , instead , the system is in a steady state where the rate of accretion onto the top of the photosphere is balanced by the loss rate at the bottom of the mixing zone , then the observed value of @xmath7(mg)/@xmath7(ca ) must be altered by the ratio of the gravitational settling times to infer the true ratio in the accreted asteroid . typically , this correction is between 0.1 dex and 0.2 dex @xcite and therefore does not affect our qualitative conclusion . if the system is in a decaying phase where there accretion is negligible and there is only gravitational settling , then the observed value of @xmath7(mg)/@xmath7(ca ) can become much larger than the value in the parent body because mg typically settles more slowly than ca @xcite .",
    "however , in this decaying phase we would also expect @xmath7(fe)/@xmath7(ca ) to become quite small because fe settles more rapidly than ca .",
    "of the 60 stars for which data are shown in figure 1 , 50 also have measured values of the fe abundance . in figure 2",
    ", we display @xmath7(fe)/@xmath7(ca ) .",
    "again , there is no evidence for refractory - dominated planetesimals .",
    "we now consider a very simplified model to assess the circumstances where we might be able to detect intact refractory - dominated planetesimals accreting onto white dwarfs .",
    "we first estimate the orbital radius where such planetesimals may form in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "we then determine if the surviving planetesimals are engulfed during the evolutionary phase when the star is on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "if not subsumed , we assume planetesimal survival into the phase when the star is a white dwarf . in this section , we consider the case where the asteroid remains in the orbital location where it formed ; in section 4 , we consider the possibility that some minor planets may be scattered outwards .",
    "to estimate the orbital location for the formation of refractory - domianted planetesimals , we extend the models of @xcite to higher stellar masses ; they mainly considered planet formation around stars of about 1 m@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we assume that refractory - dominated planetesimals form where the midplane disk temperature , @xmath10 , is low enough that calcium and aluminum both form solid oxides , yet high enough that silicon , magnesium and iron remain in the gas phase . for the gas pressures of interest and for a solar system - like composition , this requires that 1340 k @xmath11 @xmath10",
    "@xmath11 1520 k for 50% condensation @xcite . for simplicity , we focus on a single condensation temperature of 1400 k.    for a pre - main - sequence star of mass , @xmath12 , which possesses a protoplanetary disk where material is accreting onto the host star with rate , @xmath13 , the effective temperature at the surface of an opaque disk , @xmath14 , at orbital distance , @xmath15 , is controlled by dissipation of accretion energy . for @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the stellar radius ,",
    "then @xcite : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the gravitational constant and stefan - boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "the midplane temperature is controlled by the vertical diffusion of radiation and is generally higher than the effective temperature at the disk surface .",
    "if the disk has a total gas surface density of @xmath21 , and if @xmath22 denotes the rosseland mean opacity , then we define the vertical optical depth from the midplane through the dust layer as : @xmath23 because energy flows in both directions and there is no net flux at the midplane , the computed temperature as a function of optical depth is somewhat different from the thermal profile in a stellar atmosphere @xcite , and : @xmath24    we now estimate the disk surface density . @xcite",
    "presume a minimum mass solar nebula where @xmath25 varies as @xmath26 .",
    "however , because we wish to extrapolate from the solar system to other environments , we adopt a simplified conventional steady state @xmath27-disk configuration where viscosity at the midplane controls the energy dissipation and the inward transport of mass . in this case",
    ", then @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath27 is the usual dimensionless viscosity scaling factor can be defined either in terms of the isentropic sound velocity or the isothermal sound velocity , a difference of a factor of @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ratio of specific heats . following @xcite in recognizing that uncertainties in the viscosity dwarf this issue , we simply define @xmath27 in terms of the isothermal sound velocity . ] and @xmath31 is the mean molecular weight of the gas . for our fiducial model ,",
    "we adopt @xmath27 = 0.01 , but the uncertainty is substantial @xcite .",
    "if the material condenses at orbital radius , @xmath32 , where the midplane temperature is @xmath33 , then from equations ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) , we find : @xmath34    to determine @xmath32 , we now estimate the opacity which depends upon the grain size distribution , maximum particle size and composition . because we consider the regime where refractory - dominated planetesimals form",
    ", we assume that grains are only composed of minerals that are combinations of cao and al@xmath3o@xmath35 .",
    "if we assume that all of the available calcium and aluminum condense , then with abundances from @xcite which are representative of g - type stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite , the mass fraction compared to hydrogen that can be condensed into solids , @xmath36 , is 2.5 @xmath4 10@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "although the grain size distribution is unknown , we are considering an environment where particles are growing into planetesimals .",
    "therefore , we expect particles to be larger than interstellar grains .",
    "it is possible that the grain size distribution follows a power law of the form @xcite : @xmath38 if so , then most of the particles are large enough that the rosseland mean opacity is determined by the particles geometric cross sections .",
    "if the maximum particle size is @xmath39 , then : @xmath40 although different minerals have different densities ; for our fiducial model , we adopt @xmath41 @xmath42 3 g @xmath43 . if @xmath44 = 1 mm @xcite , then @xmath22 = 2.0 @xmath4 10@xmath45 @xmath46 g@xmath47 . however , this opacity is uncertain by at least a factor of 10 .",
    "we now evaluate equation ( 5 ) for our fiducial model describing the formation of refractory - dominated planetesimals .",
    "if @xmath12 = 1.0 m@xmath9 , @xmath13 = 3 @xmath4 10@xmath48 m@xmath9 yr@xmath47 , @xmath33 = 1400 k and the gas is composed of molecular hydrogen and helium with a solar fractional abundance so that @xmath31 = 2.4 @xmath49 where @xmath49 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , we expect @xmath32 = 0.38 au .",
    "therefore , for this stellar mass and accretion rate , we reproduce the results computed in much more detailed models @xcite .    the temperature in the disk midplane being as high as @xmath21400 k is mainly a consequence of the accretion rate being greater than 10@xmath48 m@xmath9 yr@xmath47 @xcite",
    ". this presumed rate of accretion is much greater than values assigned to t tau disks of @xmath210@xmath50 m@xmath9 yr@xmath47 @xcite .",
    "however , because 10% of accretion during a star s pre - main - sequence evolution is accreted during a high luminosity short - lived fu ori phase @xcite , planetesimal formation during this evolutionary phase may occur . in any case , because earth s composition is well explained by condensation into solids at @xmath21100 k @xcite , a short - lived phase solid - forming",
    "when the midplane temperature was near 1400 k at 0.4 au seems plausible .",
    "equipped with this simple model , we now extrapolate to more massive stars to estimate the orbital location where very refractory planetesimals may form .",
    "although there is wide variability @xcite , we assume that the relevant accretion rate for the era of the formation of very refractory planetesimals equals our fiducial value of 3 @xmath4 10@xmath48 m@xmath9 yr@xmath47 independent of @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , from equation ( 5 ) , we expect that the orbital location of the formation of refractory - dominated planetesimals is : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the fiducial opacity .",
    "even if very refractory planetesimals formed , they might be engulfed and not survive the star s red giant evolution .",
    "we now compare the orbital radius of extremely refractory planetesimals with the size of the star when it is on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "denote @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the initial main - sequence mass and the final white dwarf mass .",
    "the maximum luminosity on the agb , @xmath55 , is approximately @xcite : @xmath56 the initial mass to final mass relationship is @xcite : @xmath57 for main - sequence stars appreciably more massive than the sun , then from equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) : @xmath58 we therefore write for the maximum radius of the star while on the agb that : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the star s effective temperature while on the agb .    with the usual assumption that the planet s orbital radius expands with constant angular momentum as the star loses mass @xcite , then the final distance from the star ,",
    "@xmath61 is : @xmath62 from equations ( 8) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) equating @xmath53 with @xmath12 , we write that @xmath63 the requirement that a planetesimal survive into the star s white dwarf evolutionary phase is that @xmath61 @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "we show in figure 3 a plot of @xmath66 as a function of a star s initial main - sequence mass . in all cases , we take @xmath60 = 3000 k @xcite . for the fiducial values of the viscosity and opacity ,",
    "we find that @xmath66 @xmath1 1 for all main - sequence stars of mass less than 6.0 m@xmath9 corresponding to a white dwarf mass of 1.1 m@xmath9 .",
    "therefore we expect that even if refractory - dominated planetesimals are formed , unless they are scattered outwards , they are destroyed when the star is on the agb .",
    "however , because the parameters with a protoplanetary disk are uncertain , we also show results in figure 3 for a case with higher opacity and/or lower viscosity .",
    "if the opacity is increased by a factor of 10 or @xmath27 is decreased by a factor of 10  equivalent changes in equation ( 14 )  then refractory - dominated planetesimals might survive through the agb evolution of main - sequence for most stars of interest . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "employ @xmath27 = 0.001 , a factor of 10 below our fiducial value ; it is possible that this lower value of @xmath27 is appropriate for some protoplanetary disks .",
    "the results in figures 1 and 2 provide support for the fiducial model .",
    "@xcite computed that refractory - dominated planetesimals may be dispersed throughout a planetary system by the migration of giant planets . if so , then the refractory - dominated planetesimals should survive the star s agb evolution , and we may be able to detect them if they are ultimately accreted onto a white dwarf . while we see from figures 1 and 2 that no known parent bodies are as refractory - rich as cais , perhaps they are subtly masked because their contribution to the observed pollution is diluted .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "first , dispersed refractory - dominated asteroids may have collided with ",
    "normal \" asteroids and the resulting parent body is only enhanced in refractories but not dominated by them .",
    "second , perhaps the observed white dwarfs have accreted multiple asteroids . because only a minority of the parent bodies might have compositions dominated by refractories , then we would only detect an enhancement of refractories but not complete domination .    before discussing these possibilities ,",
    "we consider the entire observed ensemble of polluted white dwarfs . in both figures 1 and 2",
    ", we see that there are ca - deficient as well as ca - enhanced objects . if the accreted parent bodies were blends of refractory - enhanced planetesimals with",
    " normal \" objects , there would not be any ca - deficient asteroids .",
    "these data therefore favor models where , on average , calcium abundances are determined by processes in which asteroids differentiate , melt and collide . in such scenarios ,",
    "refractory elements can be exchanged among the planetesimal population , but there is no net enhancement .",
    "in contrast , if blending of refractory - dominated planetesimals into  normal \" asteroids prevailed , then we would never detect objects which are ca - deficient .",
    "nevertheless , although there is no evidence from the ensemble of examined extrasolar asteroidal material for the formation of refractory - dominated planetesimals , there may be individual instances where this occurs and below we discuss this possibility .      to assess the possibility that there may be particular parent bodies which are composed of a blend of a refractory - dominated planetesimal with a ",
    "normal \" object , we consider on a case - by - case basis those white dwarfs where the external pollution is comprehensively measured .",
    "currently , as listed in table 1 , there are seven polluted dwarfs where at least seven elements heavier than helium , including all four major elements in bulk earth - o , mg , si and fe , have been detected and the results published . equipped with these data , we can make a well - constrained estimate of the mass fractions carried in different elements , including the refractory elements measured in each star as listed in table 1 .    while the evolutionary history of each individual object is unknown , a parent body can be considered a candidate for a blend if every detected refractory element has a mass fraction significantly larger than its corresponding fraction in bulk earth . because typical uncertainties in abundance determinations are near 0.2 dex and because there is about 0.1 dex dispersion in the relative elemental abundances among main - sequence stars near the sun , enhancements of an element s mass fraction by less than a factor of two are not clearly well - established .",
    "furthermore , if the accreted parent body is a blend of a refractory - dominated planetesimal with an ambient object , then every refractory is expected to be enhanced .    * gd 40 : in this star s pollution , the mass fractions of ca and ti are enhanced over bulk earth s value . however , according to @xcite , the mass fraction of al in this star s pollution is 0.013 ; slightly less than the value of 0.015 for bulk earth @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a blend . *",
    "wd j0738 + 1835 : according to @xcite the mass fractions of al , ca , ti and sc are all below earth s values . there is no evidence for a blend . * pg 0843 + 516 : al is only 0.005 of the mass fraction of the accreted material @xcite ; less than bulk earth s value of 0.015 .",
    "there is no evidence for a blend .",
    "* wd 1226 + 110 : according to @xcite , while elevated , the mass fractions of al and ca are less than a factor of two greater than bulk earth s .",
    "consequently , there is at best weak evidence for blending . *",
    "wd 1929 + 012 : according to @xcite , the mass fraction of al is 0.002 , much lower than bulk earth s value .",
    "there is no evidence for a blend .",
    "* g241 - 6 : according to @xcite , the mass fraction of al is less than 0.007 .",
    "consequently , there is no evidence for a blend . *",
    "hs 2253 + 8023 : ti has essentially a solar mass fraction in the measured pollution of this star .",
    "consequently , there is no evidence for a blend .",
    "at least in this small sample of seven well - studied externally polluted white dwarfs , there is at best weak evidence that one parent body is a blend of a refractory - dominated planetesimal with an ambient asteroid .",

    "stars with dust disks are exhibiting the tidal disruption of one large parent body . that is , we would expect different asteroids to have slightly different orbital inclinations and once their solid material is tidally - disrupted , the mutual collision speeds in the roche zone between the two sets of dust grains would be so great that the grains would be vaporized . also , if extrasolar asteroids are at all like the solar system s , the bulk of the parent body mass is contained in a relatively few objects .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the accretion of large amounts of mass is from single objects .",
    "in fact , it is observed that the white dwarfs with the greatest amounts of pollution are likely to have a dust disk @xcite .    in figures 1 and 2 , we distinguish between stars with dust disks and those without .",
    "we see no evidence that the stars with dust disks  objects likely polluted by a single large parent body  have a composition on average any different from those perhaps polluted by multiple asteroids .",
    "therefore , these data do not provide any support for scenarios describing a long - term survival and subsequent accretion of intact refractory - dominated planetesimals .",
    "previous work has shown that extrasolar planetesimals at least qualitatively resemble rocky planets in the inner solar system because ( i ) they are largely composed of o , mg , si and fe ; ( ii ) c is usually deficient by at least an order of magnitude and ( iii ) h@xmath3o usually is less than 1% of the bulk composition .",
    "these results where volatiles are always deficient can be understood as a result of a condensation sequence in the protoplanetary nebula @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the behavior of volatiles which are never seen to be enhanced , as shown in figures 1 and 2 , refractory elements such as calcium can be either deficient or enhanced .",
    "therefore , as an ensemble , extrasolar planetesimals are more than a simple blend of refractory - dominated planetesimals with  normal \" asteroids .",
    "further data will be most helpful . by measuring a large suite of elements in the composition of the parent body , detailed comparison with models becomes possible .",
    "a scenario of compositional reciprocity where one asteroid s loss is another s gain may explain much of the data for refractory elements in the entire ensemble of extrasolar planetesimals .",
    "we have compiled from the literature measured values of @xmath7(ca)/@xmath7(mg ) and @xmath7(ca)/@xmath7(fe ) for externally - polluted white dwarfs ; none of the accreted parent bodies are composed primarily of refractory material .",
    "we argue on the basis of a toy model for protoplanetary nebula that unless dispersed from their original orbital location , refractory - dominated planetesimals likely would be destroyed during the star s agb evolution . as yet , there is at best weak evidence to support the hypothesis that a refractory - dominated planetesimal was scattered from its zone of formation and then blended into material accreted onto an externally - polluted white dwarf .",

    "<S> previously published observations of 60 externally - polluted white dwarfs show that none of the stars have accreted from intact refractory - dominated parent bodies composed mainly of al , ca and o , although planetesimals with such a distinctive composition have been predicted to form . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that such remarkable objects are not detected , by themselves , because , unless they are scattered outward from their initial orbit , they are engulfed and destroyed during the star s asymptotic giant branch evolution . as - yet , there is at most only weak evidence supporting a scenario where the composition of any extrasolar minor planet can be explained by blending of an outwardly scattered refractory - dominated planetesimal with an ambient asteroid .    </S>"
