    "recent observations have revealed the existence of a population of hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) traveling in the halo of the milky way ( mw ) with galactic rest - frame velocities @xmath2 in the range between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "hvss are probably b - type main sequence stars with lifetimes @xmath5 , galactocentric distances @xmath6 kpc , and move with speeds large enough to escape from the galaxy .",
    "the significant excess of b - type stars with velocities @xmath7 and distances @xmath8 kpc observed by @xcite may also be an indication that many hvss are ejected into the halo on _ bound _ orbits .",

    "only a close encounter with a relativistic potential well can accelerate a 3 - 4 @xmath9 star to such extreme velocities , and at least three different ejection mechanisms have been proposed : the interaction between background stars and an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) inspiralling towards sgr a@xmath10 @xcite , the disruption of stellar binaries in the tidal field of sgr a@xmath10 @xcite , and the scattering of stars off a cluster of stellar - mass bhs orbiting sgr a@xmath10 @xcite in all these models , hvss have unique kinematics compared to other halo stars : 1 ) they have almost zero initial specific angular momentum at ejection , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 the mass of sgr @xmath13 and @xmath14 the pericenter distance of the star ; 2 ) their high speeds diminish the impact of two - body relaxation or dynamical friction effects on their motion ; and 3 ) their trajectories will deviate from being exactly radial because of the asymmetry of the milky way potential produced by the flattened disk and the triaxial dark matter ( dm ) halo , causing a change of angular momentum that can be much larger than the initial small value .",
    "( for reference , a @xmath15 deviation of the velocity from the radial direction at @xmath16 represents a change of @xmath17 in specific angular momentum . ) proper - motion measurements of hvss may therefore become a key diagnostic tool for constraining the shape of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "triaxial halos are a generic prediction of the hierarchical , cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of structure formation .",
    "dissipationless cosmological simulations typically predict minor - to - major density axis ratios in the range 0.4 - 0.8 ( e.g. @xcite ) , with the asphericity of the potential increasing rapidly towards the center of the halo @xcite .",
    "gas cooling tends to circularize the potential ( e.g. @xcite ) , while subsequent mergers produce highly elongated remnants ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we study the kinematics of hvss and propose an estimator of dark halo triaxiality that is determined only by instantaneous position and velocity vectors of hvss at large galactocentric distances ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the case of a substantially triaxial halo , the distribution of deflection angles ( the angle between the stellar position and velocity vector ) for hvss on bound orbits is spread uniformly over the range 10@xmath1180@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> future astrometric and deep wide - field surveys should measure the positions and velocities of a significant number of hvss , and provide useful constraints on the shape of the galactic dark matter halo .    </S>",
