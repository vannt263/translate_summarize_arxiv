    "nowadays , many efforts have been devoted to producing the electric power from renewable energy sources among which the wind power is the most technically favorable and economically attractive @xcite . however , volatile and uncontrollable characteristics of the wind power generation lead to stability concerns for the secure and economic operation of modern smart grids .",
    "as the wind penetration grows continuously , it is imperative to investigate the impacts of wind power generations on the system stability .    in the literature",
    ", the impacts of the wind power generation have been studied concerning different types of stabilities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite-@xcite investigated the impacts of different parameters ( e.g. , the reactive power compensation , distance to the fault , and rotor inertia ) on the transient and frequency stabilities of a power system ; @xcite addressed the influence of different wind generators on the transient stability ; @xcite and @xcite studied the detrimental and beneficial influences of wind generators on transient and small - signal stabilities by converting wind generators to conventional synchronous generators ; @xcite@xcite analyzed the impacts of various control algorithms of wind generators on the long - term stability . in those studies , the variable nature of wind power",
    "is not considered and the wind speed is oversimplified as constant . to address this concern , @xcite-@xcite adopted an approach that describes the uncertainty of the wind power by stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) and investigated the impacts of the wind generation on rotor - angle and small - signal stabilities , in which , however , the wind power was simply modeled as a gaussian white noise perturbation on the power injection .",
    "regarding the long - term stability analysis that focuses on the time scale when fast dynamics damp out and control devices start working , however , a comprehensive framework is still missing in the literature to characterize the wind power with various stochastic properties , lay down a theoretical foundation for the stability assessment of these stochastic systems , and develop efficient numerical tools for such stability analysis . to address these issues , the weibull model of the wind speed",
    "has been incorporated into the dynamic model of the power system to perform the long - term stability analysis @xcite , where sdes are applied to describe the dynamics of the wind speed . by this sde - based model ,",
    "a theoretical approach that approximates the stochastic model by a deterministic model has been developed to reduce the computational burden caused by an accurate quantification of the uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed model and methodology are only applicable to continuous power system models . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrete events induced by control and protective devices occur frequently in a long time scale after contingencies @xcite .",
    "for instance , load tap changers are to restore the load - side voltages ; shunt compensation switchings act to increase the transmission capability ; and overexcitation limiters may be activated to protect the generators from overheating .",
    "these discrete dynamics are generally designed to act after the fast dynamics damp out so as to avoid unnecessary interactions with the fast dynamics @xcite-@xcite , and they require accurate representation by discrete models in time - domain simulation @xcite . as a result , it is imperative to integrate discrete models to perform the comprehensive long - term stability analysis for realistic power systems .",
    "the paper begins by showing that a power grid integrating wind power generations can be modeled as a stochastic hybrid model ( shm ) , with discrete dynamics , in a sde - based framework in which the wind speed model that captures various stochastic properties can be integrated .",
    "in particular , it is analytically shown in this framework that shm can be approximated by a deterministic hybrid model ( dhm ) which offers an accurate trajectory approximation ( for shm ) and stability assessments with high computational efficiency if some mild sufficient conditions are satisfied .",
    "a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of dhm .",
    "it is noteworthy that shm must be implemented whenever any proposed sufficient conditions are violated . to show this necessity",
    ", we present several numerical examples in which dhm fails to capture the instabilities of shm .",
    "the causes for the failure are investigated and shown to correspond to a violation of the sufficient conditions .",
    "this discussion complements the proposed sde - based framework , shows the application scope of the approximation methodology , and also emphasizes the largely - neglected necessity of the stochastic model in the long - term stability analysis .",
    "as the modern smart grids endeavor to incorporate high penetration of intermittent renewable energy , integrate plug - in vehicles , and encourage opportunistic users , the operation and control of power grids are required to account for the resulting high variability and uncertainty .",
    "we believe that the proposed sde - based framework and approximation methodology can be readily generalized to conduct stability assessments for power systems with the uncertainties brought about by various renewable energy sources , plug - in vehicles , smart appliances , opportunistic users , and so forth .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectionmodel ] introduces the sde - based framework of power system models integrating the stochastic dynamics of the wind speed .",
    "section [ sectiontheory ] develops an approximation methodology for shm in the sde - based framework , which provides an accurate trajectory approximation and correct stability assessments with a high simulation speed .",
    "in particular , a diagram is summarized at the end of section [ subsectiontheory ] to illustrate the relationships among the proposed models and theoretical results .",
    "furthermore , section [ sectionnecessity ] presents some critical cases in which some sufficient conditions of the proposed methodology are violated , to explain the necessity of implementing shm to obtain correct stability assessments .",
    "the conventional long - term stability model ( i.e. , the complete dynamic model ) without stochasticity for simulating the system dynamic response to a disturbance in the @xmath0 time scale can be described as follows ( see ( 22)-(25 ) @xcite and ( 15 ) @xcite ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 refers to @xmath4 . here , ( [ slowdde ] ) accounts for the long - term discrete events , such as shunt capacitors and load tap changers ( ltcs ) ; ( [ slowode ] ) depicts the slow dynamics , including self restorative loads , turbine governors ( tgs ) , and overexcitation limiters ( oxls ) ; ( [ fastode ] ) describes the fast dynamics of components , such as synchronous machines , doubly - fed induction generators ( dfigs ) , induction motors , and exciters ; and ( [ algebraiceqn ] ) describes the power flow relation and internal relationships between variables .",

    "the impacts of the wind power on the system stability have been addressed @xcite-@xcite in which the wind speed is termed as a constant and an entry of the vector @xmath18algebraic variables . in this paper , we characterize the randomness of the wind speed by a stochastic model .    specifically , given @xmath19 independent wind energy sources that each energy source follows a certain probability distribution , the wind speeds of the @xmath19 sources are collectively denoted by a vector @xmath20 in the following model ( see @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , the matrix @xmath23\\in \\mathbb{r}^{{n_w}\\times{n_w}}\\ ] ] determines the autocorrelation property of @xmath20 ( see below for more details ) , and @xmath24 is an @xmath19-dimensional wiener process . in addition , @xmath25^t$ ] , @xmath26^t$ ] , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cumulative distribution function of the corresponding wind speed @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the cumulative distribution function of a gaussian distribution .    in model ( [ wind1])-([wind2 ] ) of the wind speed , @xmath31 is a vector ornstein - uhlenbeck process , and each @xmath29 matches the distribution of @xmath28 by the property of the memoryless transformation @xcite . for example , if the wind speed of source @xmath32 is governed by the weibull distribution with a shape parameter @xmath33 and a scale parameter @xmath34 , then @xmath35 and @xmath29 has the following statistical properties ( see ( 26)-(28)@xcite ) :    a.   @xmath36={\\lambda_i}\\gamma(1+\\frac{1}{{k_i}})={\\mu_{w_i}}$ ] .",

    "note that @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the parameters that determine the statistical properties of wind speed @xmath29 , but @xmath42 does not .",

    "recall that discrete dynamics described by ( [ dde ] ) play important roles in the long - term stability because many protective and control devices may take effect in the long - term time scale to restore the load - sided power , protect generators , and so on .",

    "so , the condition of consistent attraction is violated.,width=172 ]    from the viewpoint of physical mechanisms , the voltage collapse is caused by an insufficient power support when ltcs try to restore the load - side voltages in the long - term time scale .",
    "immediately after the contingency , the system can maintain the short - term stability by the control of exciters .",
    "after that , ltcs start to work at 30s and try to restore the load - side voltages and then the corresponding load powers .",
    "at 112s , the oxl at gen 1 is activated to protect the generator from overheating and thus restrict the power support from gen 1 .",
    "to make it even worse , the power output of dfig at bus 2 suddenly decreases as shown in fig .",
    "[ windpower ] because of a sharp drop in the wind speed .",
    "the power imbalance between the loads and the generators finally leads to the voltage collapse in the shm . in the dhm , however , the wind power does not change drastically as shown in fig .",
    "[ windpower ] , since the wind speed is supposed to be invariable .",
    "so , the dfig at bus 2 can provide enough power required by the action of ltcs to maintain the voltage stability of the dhm .        from this example , some important physical insights can be obtained .",
    "if the wind power plays a significant role in supporting power to maintain the stability , for example when the penetration level is high ( 8.42% in this example ) , then the stochastic properties of the wind may need to be considered in the stability analysis , especially when the system operates close to the stability boundary .",
    "the second example using an ieee 9-bus system is presented to reveal another cause for the failure of the dhm . in the system , the classical model of gen",
    "is employed .",
    "a weibull - distributed wind source drives a dfig at bus 3 , and three gens are equipped with tgs , avrs , and oxls , respectively , where the initial time delays of oxls are 70s .",
    "in addition , three erls are located at bus 5 , 6 , and 8 , respectively ; while three discrete ltcs are located at bus 5 - 4 , bus 9 - 6 , and bus 2 - 7 , respectively , the initial time delays of which are 60s and fixed tapping delays are 10s . at 1s ,",
    "a fault occurs at bus 6 and is cleared 5 cycles later .",
    "the parameter values are detailed in appendix [ appendix2 - 2 ] .                    in this case , the slow manifold @xmath64 is unstable , which implies that nearby dynamics will move away from the slow manifold . as condition ( i ) in _ theorem 1 _ and _ theorem 2 _ is violated , neither the concentration of sample path stated in _ theorem 1 _ nor the trajectory relationship described in _ theorem 2 _ holds .",
    "the trajectory of the shm is not concentrated around that of the dhm , i.e. , the dhm can not provide an accurate trajectory approximation for the shm , but both of them are unstable in the long - term sense .    from the perspective of physical mechanisms , the instability is caused by the poor control of ltcs which are originally designed to help maintain the stability .",
    "the discrete switching of ltcs makes the slow manifold jump from the stable component of the constraint manifold to an unstable component such that the nearby trajectories move away .",
    "the switching events , such as ltcs and shunt compensation , are adopted commonly as countermeasures against the voltage instability .",
    "but , this example shows that great caution is necessary when executing those control strategies , because unexpected stability issues may arise , especially when more wind power is integrated into the power grid .",
    "this paper proposes a comprehensive sde - based framework for conducting the long - term stability analysis for the power grid with wind power generations .",
    "this framework incorporates the discrete dynamics induced by various control devices and the stochastic model of the wind speed with different probability distributions . to relieve the computational burden , a dhm is composed and",
    "can provide an accurate trajectory approximation and correct stability assessments for the shm under some mild sufficient conditions .",
    "numerical examples are further discussed to show that the dhm can fail in some critical cases because of a violation of the proposed sufficient conditions , which complements the proposed sde - based framework and also highlights the necessity of the shm in the stability analysis , especially if the system operates close to the stability boundary or experiences a high variability . for the future work ,",
    "we plan to extend the present framework to the stability analysis of power grids with various other uncertainties and further improve the computational efficiency of the approximation methodology using the qss model that integrates uncertainties .",
