    "the concept of multi - quark hadrons has received revived interest due to the narrow resonances in the spectrum of states .",
    "recently , several new particles were experimentally discovered and confirmed as the candidates of multi - quark states .",
    "these discoveries are expected to reveal new aspects of hadron physics . among these discoveries ,",
    "the tetra - quark systems are also interesting in terms of their rich phenomenology , in particular for mesons which still remain a most fascinating subject of research .",
    "the @xmath6 states are interesting in terms of the recent experimental discoveries of @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite , which are expected to be tetra - quark candidates .",
    "the particle data group lists @xmath10 tensor mesons with masses in the range @xmath11 @xmath12 and considers them as well - established .",
    "the @xmath13 candidates , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite are isosinglet . the relevant channels of decay are @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the @xmath14 and @xmath18 and @xmath16 for @xmath15 . due to their @xmath16 decay , one would expect @xmath14 and @xmath15 are very likely one state ; the mass shift could be a measurement error or could be caused by the @xmath16 threshold",
    ". however , the results for @xmath15 favour an intrinsically narrower state , strongly coupled to @xmath18 and weakly coupled to the other channel for allowed @xmath19-wave decays .",
    "following the recent re - analysis of the bnl data @xcite we discuss the state @xmath15 as a @xmath20 state .",
    "the multi - quark states have been investigated in lattice qcd studied with somewhat mixed results @xcite . at the present status of approximations ,",
    "lattice qcd seems to provide a trustworthy guide into unknown territory in tetra - quark hadron physics @xcite . using the quenched approximation , and discarding quark - antiquark annihilation diagrams",
    ", we construct @xmath21 sources from multiple operators .",
    "note that we are working in quenched approximation which in principal is unphysical .",
    "however , previous lattice results on masses and decay constants turn out to be in good agreement with experimental values @xcite .",
    "this seems to suggest that it is plausible to use quenched lattice qcd to investigate the mass spectra .",
    "we exclude the processes that mix @xmath22 and @xmath23 and allow the quark masses to vary from small to large values . in the absence of quark annihilation , we do not expect any mixing of @xmath24 with pure glue .",
    "thus we can express the @xmath24 correlation functions in terms of a basis determined by quark exchange diagrams only ( ignoring the single , double and annihilation diagrams among wick s contractions ) . another important question is whether the interpolating operator one uses has a significant overlap with the state in question . to construct an interpolating field which has significant overlap with the @xmath6 system",
    ", we adopt the so - called variational method to compute @xmath25 correlation matrix from two different interpolating fields and from its eigenvalues we extract the masses .",
    "thus , assuming that the quenching uncertainties do not effect our conclusions dramatically , we investigate the optimized correlation function and use it to examine lowest - lying tetra - quark resonance as @xmath26 states in the spectrum of @xmath25 correlation matrix .",
    "the simplest local interpolators can be written in terms of colour - singlet configuration of a product of colour - neutral meson interpolation fields .",
    "we propose a non-@xmath18 interpolating field to extract the @xmath27 tetraquark state .",
    "this choice is designed to maximize the possibility to observe attraction between tetraquark constituents at relatively large quark masses . with a @xmath18 operator",
    "it is possible that there is a small amount of the compact @xmath6 component in the two - body interpolating field since the interpolator may contain a large contamination of @xmath18 scattering states .",

    "thus the @xmath6 state can be singled out as much as possible and the results are less biased by the contamination of two - state scattering states .",
    "the other type of interpolating field is one in which quarks and anti - quarks are coupled into a set of diquark and antidiquark , respectively and has the form @xmath29\\epsilon_{ade}\\left[{\\bar q}_{d}c\\gamma { \\bar q}^{t}_{e}\\right ] .",

    "the bare mass of the strange quark is determined by extracting the mass of the vector meson @xmath54 . at @xmath55 ,",

    "this verifies that the strange bare quark mass of @xmath62 used is very close ( within @xmath63 ) to the physical strange quark mass .",
    "the quark propagators are then computed at seven values of the hopping parameter @xmath64 which cover the strange quark mass region of @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 . inspired by the good agreement of the ratio with the experimental value , the scale was set alternatively by @xmath59 .",

    "( [ eqn07 ] ) .",
    "we choose one  best fit \" which is insensitive to the fit range , has high confidence level and reasonable statistical errors .",
    "we then confirm this by looking at the plateau region of the correlator .",
    "statistical errors of masses are estimated by the jackknife method and the goodness of the fit is gauged by the @xmath70 , chosen according to criteria that @xmath70 is preferably close to @xmath71 .",
    "the effective mass is found to be stable using different values of @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn07 ] ) , which suggests that the ground state in question is correctly projected .",
    "suppressing any data point which has error larger than its mean value , the possible plateau is seen in the region @xmath72 with reasonable errors , where the single - state dominance is expected to be achieved .",
    "fitting the effective mass in the window @xmath73 is found to optimize the @xmath70 . to avoid the clutter in fig .",

    ", the first error is statistical , and second one is our estimate of combined systematic uncertainty including those coming from chiral extrapolation and quenching effects .",
    "note that we can not estimate the discretization error since we have only one lattice spacing to work with .",
    "given the fact that the ratio does not show any scaling violations , we could also quote the value of this quantity on our finest lattice , which has the smallest error",
    ". nevertheless , order @xmath78 errors on the finally quoted values are mostly due to the chiral extrapolations .",
    "the quenching errors might be the largest source of uncertainty .",
    "note however , that in the case of mass ratios of stable hadrons , this is not expected to be very important .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that with an appropriate definition of scale , the mass ratios of stable hadrons are described correctly by the quenched approximation on the @xmath79 level . to this end",
    "we also calculated the pseudoscalar to vector meson ratio @xmath80 and pseudoscalar to nucleon mass ratio @xmath81 and found that in the physical limit these ratios differ about @xmath82 from their corresponding experimental values .",
    "so we quote our quenching errors to be less than two percent .",
    "we presented the results of our investigation on the tetraquark systems in improved anisotropic lattice qcd in the quenched approximation .",
    "the mass of @xmath83 state was computed using field operators , which are motivated by the non-@xmath84 and diquark structure . in the quenched approximation , our results suggest that our interpolators have sufficient overlap with @xmath85 to allow a successful correlation matrix analysis and produced the evidence that the mass of the lowest - lying state only agrees marginally with the mass of @xmath3 . in the region of pion mass which we are able to access , we saw no evidence of attraction that could be associated with the existence of a resonance in @xmath83 channel .",
    "since our estimated value for the mass of @xmath86 is marginally close to its experimental value , we suspect that might be the @xmath3 resonance captured by our optimized correlator .",
    "however , on the other hand , our spectral weight ratio for two different lattice volumes deviates from one ( the essential criterion for resonance ) with large errors for small quark masses , observed state exhibits the expected volume dependence in the spectral weight for two particles in a box .",
    "the ground - state is found to be consistent with scattering state .",
    "our estimated values serve as predictions of lattice qcd in quenched approximation . indeed ,",
    "our simulation does not include dynamical quarks , the final conclusions will have to wait till both disconnected correlators and annihilation contributions are incorporated ."
