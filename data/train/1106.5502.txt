    ", we use the longest wavelength pacs band that had a significant ( @xmath20 ) detection .",
    "the color - coding indicates the redshift of the galaxies .",
    "it is a well - known fact that galaxies that are highly actively star - forming are more common at larger lookback times .",

    ", we find little difference between the pacs and 24 @xmath2m - based estimates , irrespective of the conversion recipe used .",
    "however , above @xmath45 and for sfrs above @xmath46 , the 24 @xmath2m - based estimates using the locally calibrated ce01 and dh02 conversions are clearly overestimated with respect to those based on pacs photometry . at @xmath33 ,",
    "no such systematic bias is present in the case of the w08 and n11 conversions .",
    "these results imply that , rather than having mid- to far - ir seds as local ulirgs , ulirgs at @xmath32 are better characterized as scaled - up versions of local lirgs , which are colder than nearby ulirgs .",
    "this finding is in agreement with recent results by nordon et al .",

    "( 2010 ) , and symeonidis et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "we point out that any variation in @xmath47 , where @xmath48 refers to the specific luminosity probed by the observed 24 @xmath2 m band , translates superlinearly to variations in @xmath49 when applying a luminosity - dependent conversion .",
    "this leads to a somewhat increased scatter around unity in the @xmath49 ratio of @xmath50 galaxies for n11 ( @xmath51 dex ) compared to w08 ( @xmath52 dex ) , since the scatter in @xmath47 at a given luminosity is large compared to any systematic variation of @xmath53 over the luminosity range probed .",
    "more importantly , the luminosity - independent conversion by w08 has the advantage of being applicable also above @xmath54 , where n11 shows more systematic outliers .",
    "this is at least in part due to the fact that the 24 @xmath2 m band starts entering the @xmath55 m regime where the ce01 templates lack a physically realistic calibration .    in order to address the uncertainties involved in converting 24 @xmath2 m to @xmath4 in more detail , we present the w08 template in figure[lir.fig ] .",
    "overplotted , we show the ir photometry of @xmath19 galaxies that are individually detected ( @xmath20 ) in at least one pacs band .",
    "their 24 @xmath2 m flux is normalized to match the template flux within the passband at the respective redshift , but their 24 @xmath2 m - pacs colors are left as observed .",
    "black filled circles and error bars mark the median and central 68th percentiles for pacs - detected galaxies at @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "gray empty circles and error bars illustrate small changes when including the lowest redshift ( @xmath57 ) sources .",
    "although a significant scatter ( 0.25 dex in @xmath58 ) is notable , the observations are in the median consistent with the w08 template .",
    "moreover , figure[lir.fig]b demonstrates that the residuals from the template do not strongly correlate with the @xmath4 derived from the respective pacs band , especially when excluding local ( @xmath59 ) galaxies , that dominate the lowest luminosities ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "in other words , we observe a spread in 24 @xmath2 m - pacs colors , even at a given redshift , but this spread does not seem to correlate strongly with galaxy luminosity . as a consequence of the observed flux limits , different luminosity bins in figure[lir.fig]b will naturally be populated by galaxies of a different redshift distribution .",
    "this could potentially mask some luminosity dependence present within a narrow redshift slice . including also observations at 16 @xmath2 m , n11 investigate this by probing the rest - frame 8 @xmath2 m luminosity in bins of both @xmath4 and redshift , finding a dependence on both albeit with significant scatter .",
    "while not capturing these physics , the w08 sed can be considered as an effective template offering a simple and robust conversion from observed 24 @xmath2 m photometry to @xmath4 .",
    "the 7.7 @xmath2 m pah strength may increase with redshift relative to @xmath4 ( see n11 ) , but for the purpose of converting mips 24 @xmath2 m to @xmath4 , it is sufficient that its strength in the template is appropriate for @xmath61 , where this feature is sampled by the 24 @xmath2 m passband . given that the scatter in @xmath62 is large compared to any variation with luminosity , not accounting for a luminosity dependence has the compensating advantage that deviations in @xmath63 at a given luminosity do not translate nonlinearly to @xmath64 .",
    "another parameter potentially contributing to the scatter observed in figure  [ lir.fig]b , is the dust temperature .",
    "more specifically , variations in the dust temperature from galaxy to galaxy would express themselves as deviations from a unique sed shape , and hence a source of scatter in figure  [ lir.fig]b .",
    "magdis et al . (",
    "2010 ) recently reported a wide range of dust temperatures in high - redshift ulirgs . for an in depth discussion of the relation between dust temperatures and other characteristics of high - redshift galaxies ( such as sfr and mass ) ,",
    "we defer the reader to magnelli et al .",
    "( in prep ) . in the appendix , we briefly discuss possible contributions by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , but argue that they do not affect the above results for the ensemble of pacs - detected galaxies . for a first exploration of agn in the context of pacs observations ,",
    "we refer the reader to shao et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    in the above analysis , we focussed on pacs detections only .",
    "while half of the 24 @xmath2 m sources in goods - south are not detected at any pacs wavelength , the pacs sample is matched quite well to the 24 @xmath2 m depth of other , shallower fields .",
    "for example , 90% of the galaxies brighter than the 24 @xmath2 m detection threshold of cosmos are pacs - detected in goods - south .",
    "this implies that the conversion described in this section can safely be applied to translate the cosmos 24 @xmath2 m photometry to @xmath4 .",
    "we briefly explored how the median sed shape changes when going beyond the pacs detection threshold by means of stacking .",
    "we computed the median stacked fluxes in bins of rest - frame wavelength now including all sources detected at 24 @xmath2 m . stacking was performed after scaling the pacs postage stamps by the same factor used to normalize the 24 @xmath2 m flux of the corresponding object to the w08 template .",
    "postage stamps of pacs - undetected sources were cut out of residual maps from which all individually detected sources were subtracted .",
    "we find that the blue side of the far - ir bump ( @xmath65 ) is somewhat more depressed , by @xmath66 dex with respect to the w08 template to which the 24 @xmath2 m flux was normalized .",
    "however , the amplitude of the peak in ir emission , where the bulk of the energy emitted at 8 - 1000 @xmath2 m comes from , is well matched by the template .",
    "the 8 - 1000 @xmath2 m integral over the dh02 or ce01 template that best fits the shape of the median stacked sed deviates by merely a percent from that of the w08 template , making the latter an acceptable basis for deriving @xmath4 for our full 24 @xmath2m - detected sample .    we conclude that a continuity between 24 @xmath2 m and far - infrared based sfr indicators can be obtained out to @xmath39 , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "the good median performance of the w08 conversion in the light of new herschel observations is encouraging for recent studies in which it was applied ( franx et al .",

    "in goods - south , not only the pacs but also the mips depth ( 0.02 mjy at 24 @xmath2 m , 5@xmath31 ) is one of the deepest available .",
    "consequently , in studies that exploit larger areas to reduce cosmic variance effects , one will be limited by the shallower mips imaging of other fields .",
    "other sfr tracers than ir - based methods are therefore indispensable .",
    "modeling of broad - band seds with stellar population synthesis models is one of the most commonly used approaches , as it is a more generally accessible means to derive sfrs ( among other stellar population properties ) for galaxies over a wide range of redshifts and types .",
    "it can also be extended to fainter galaxies with lower sfrs .",
    "we investigate the performance of this technique , which is essentially a dust correction method , by comparing it to @xmath10 for galaxies with a pacs and/or mips detection .",
    "the @xmath4 that enters the computation of @xmath10 was calculated using the w08 template and the longest wavelength ir band that had a significant detection .",
    "we adopt default assumptions regarding sed modeling .",
    "briefly , exponentially declining sfhs , also known as @xmath67 models , were constructed from the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) stellar population synthesis models , and fitted to the @xmath1-to-8 @xmath2 m fireworks seds using the fitting code fast ( kriek et al .",
    "we are aware that increasing star formation histories have recently been proposed as more appropriate for galaxy evolution at early times ( @xmath68 , renzini et al .",

    "2010 ; papovich et al .",
    "2011 ) , and explore this option further in section[delayedtau.sec ] . for now",
    ", we restrict the analysis of our @xmath69 sample to default @xmath67 models whose wide use in the literature makes it worthwhile testing their performance in light of the new ir constraints . as throughout the paper , we adopt a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , and we assume solar metallicity .",
    "we required the time since the onset of star formation to be at least 50 myr , and not exceeding the age of the universe at the epoch of observation .",
    "we experimented with minimum e - folding times varying between 10 myr and 10 gyr .",
    "the fitting procedure minimizes the @xmath70 statistic taking discrete steps of 0.1 dex in age and @xmath67 within the allowed range .",
    "we allow the galaxies to be attenuated within a range of visual extinctions @xmath71 , in steps of 0.1 mag , assuming a uniform foreground screen geometry , and with the reddening following the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) law .",
    "we refer to the instantaneous sfr of the best - fit model as @xmath9 .",
    "we find the best correspondence to @xmath10 when forcing the e - folding time to be larger than @xmath72 .",
    "the plotted points in figure  [ sfrbasic.fig ] correspond to this set of boundary conditions . the majority of galaxies , at low to intermediate ( @xmath73 ) sfrs line up along a ridge line which coincides with the one - to - one relation .",
    "a tail toward lower sed - modeled sfrs is present , and contains more than 50% of the galaxies at the high sfr ( and high redshift ) end . when allowing shorter e - folding times , we find these are often preferred in a least - squares sense , but leave a systematic offset in sfr in comparison to measurements of @xmath10 . the red and yellow line in figure  [ sfrbasic.fig ] indicate the median trend for @xmath74 and 7.5 respectively .",
    "it thus seems that e - folding timescales of at least several 100 myr give results that are more consistent with uv+ir based estimates than more rapidly declining histories .",
    "models implies an increase by a factor @xmath75 , the dependence on @xmath76 reduces , and sfrs derived with short @xmath76 would agree better with @xmath10 .",
    "however , given the implausibly young ages associated with those fits ( see section [ tracingback.sec ] ) longer e - folding times still seem preferred . ] in section  [ tracingback.sec ] , we will describe independent evidence in this direction , based on the implausibly young ages inferred from fits with small @xmath67 values .",
    "changing @xmath77 from 8.5 to 9 leads to a similar performance in the comparison to @xmath10 .",
    "however , when allowing very long e - folding times only ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath9 becomes an overestimate at intermediate star formation levels ( see orange curve in figure  [ sfrbasic.fig ] ) .",
    "overall , we recommend @xmath79 , for its effectiveness at reproducing the low to intermediate sfrs while not overly restricting the allowed range of sfhs .",
    "to contrast this timescale of @xmath80 myr for variations in star formation activity with another characteristic timescale of the galaxies in our sample , we computed the dynamical time @xmath81 of the 27% of galaxies that are covered by the hst / wfc3 early release science program . here , we measured the effective radius @xmath82 by fitting sersic models to the @xmath83-band surface brightness distribution using galfit v3.0 ( peng et al .",
    "we find typical @xmath84 ratios of order @xmath85 , with large variations from 10 to 100 and up .",
    "this implies that most star formation happened in a relatively stable mode over long timescales , as opposed to a single short burst taking place on a dynamical time .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn by genzel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who pushed the study of the schmidt - kennicutt law ( schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1998 ) and the elmegreen - silk relationship ( elmegreen 1997 ; silk 1997 ) for normal star - forming galaxies to @xmath86 .    despite the good overall correspondence between the sfr indicators , the tail of systematic underestimates by @xmath9 , reaching an order of magnitude at the largest @xmath87 ( predominantly galaxies at @xmath7 ) remains worrisome .",
    "such a trend at the high - sfr end was previously signaled by santini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on the basis of pre - herschel data sets .",
    "figure[del_vs_iroveruv.fig ] sheds light on its origin .",
    "the deviation from a one - to - one relation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 is a clear function of the relative ratio of emission from young stars that is re - processed by dust versus escaping unhindered as uv light .",
    "the diagram illustrates that particularly when the unattenuated uv emission reveals only a few percent of the total star formation ( i.e. , when the dust correction factor is very large ) , a simplistic dust correction method based on a uniform foreground screen does not account properly for optical depth effects .",
    "the reason is that information on the dust correction factor is not directly embedded in the galaxy s sed .",
    "it is the reddening of the spectral slope that is directly traced , but only translates linearly to extinction when the obscuring material has the configuration of a foreground screen . in case of patchy dust obscuration , or dust that is mixed with the emitting sources , reddening saturates as a tracer of extinction . in the case of selective extinction towards young star - forming regions , the resulting underestimate of the sfr",
    "can be even more pronounced ( poggianti et al .",
    "2001 ; wuyts et al .",
    "the same effect is seen in local ulirgs ( goldader et al . 2002 ) and starburst galaxies ( e.g. , frster schreiber 2001 and references therein ) that lie above the well - known irx-@xmath88 relation ( meurer et al .",

    "a similar trend emerges as seen for the sed modeling ( section  [ sedvsuvir.sec ] ) . while at intermediate @xmath10 , the two sfr indicators agree well , the dust correction method fails to recover the total amount of star formation at the largest @xmath10 .",
    "we note that , when binning in @xmath14 ( i.e. , the sfr indicator to be tested ) instead of @xmath10 ( our reference sfr indicator ) , the median @xmath10 of the highest @xmath14 bin actually lies below the one - to - one relation ( _ large open circles _ ) .",
    "the fact that the median binned relation depends on the axis that is binned reflects a significant scatter in the relation between the uv+ir and dust - corrected sfr .",
    "the absence of a tight relation may stem from variations in the dust distribution from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the color - coding in figure  [ sfrdaddi.fig ] furthermore indicates that the scatter is not random , but that instead the relation between the two sfr indicators is a function of @xmath93-band magnitude .",
    "this illustrates that the offset with respect to @xmath10 depends on the properties of the galaxy sample .",

    "the impact of the treatment of certain stellar evolutionary phases , such as the thermally pulsating agb phase , on the estimated stellar mass and age of ( high - z ) galaxies has been discussed extensively elsewhere ( see , e.g. , maraston 2005 , hereafter m05 ; maraston et al .",

    "we adopted the same restriction of a minimum e - folding time of @xmath95 that provided the best agreement for bc03 models .",
    "similar to the bc03 comparison in figure  [ sfrbasic.fig ] , the sed modeled sfrs lead to underestimates at the high @xmath10 end .",

    ", our cross - calibration of sfr indicators can not discriminate between different stellar population synthesis models .",
    "we find , however , that bc03 , m05 and cb07 models require different constraints on the minimum e - folding time ( @xmath72 , 7.5 , and 9.5 respectively ) in order to optimally match the uv+ir based indicator .",
    "figure  [ sfrstelpop.fig ] demonstrates that the sed fitting results based on m05 and cb07 models show qualitative differences despite the fact that both contain an updated implementation of the tp - agb phase , leading to increased rest - frame @xmath93-band fluxes and lower stellar mass estimates .",
    "the two stellar population synthesis models differ in at least two aspects .",
    "first , the boost in rest - frame @xmath93-band light due to tp - agb stars occurs at earlier times for cb07 ( around @xmath99 ) compared to m05 ( around @xmath100 ) .",
    "second , the optical ( rest - frame @xmath101 ) colors by cb07 are identical to those of bc03 , whereas they are redder by nearly 0.2 mag in the m05 models for most of the ages considered .",
    "this stems from the use of different stellar tracks that do ( in the case of cb07 ) or do not ( for m05 ) include convective overshooting ( see maraston et al . 2006 ; fagotto et al .",
    "1994 for the padova stellar tracks used by cb07 ; cassisi et al .",
    "1997 for the frascati stellar tracks used by m05 ) .",
    "together , these differences lead to best - fit solutions that in the case of m05 correspond to younger , dustier and more actively star - forming systems than inferred from bc03 fits , while cb07 fits yield lower sfrs and @xmath102 , and older ages . as we will discuss in section[consistency.sec ] , the stellar ages derived from bc03 models without stringent constraints on formation redshift or e - folding time tend to be implausibly young",
    ". this problem may therefore be even more pressing when considering m05 fits .",
    "finally , we note that for both m05 and cb07 fits , solutions with ages for which the tp - agb contribution is maximal , seem to be avoided .",
    "the apparent bimodality in the upper left panel of figure  [ sfrstelpop.fig ] is a reflection of this bimodality in estimated ages . along similar lines , kriek et al .",

    ", we find that , in common for all stellar population models considered , underestimates of the sfr for the dusty , most actively star - forming galaxies , that are abundantly present at high redshift , are intrinsic to any dust correction method assuming a uniform foreground screen . sed modeling recipes can be tuned to reproduce the level of star formation in galaxies with more modest @xmath10 .",
    "so far , we always assumed the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) law for the wavelength dependence of the attenuation .",
    "although this law is widely used in the high - redshift literature , reddening laws are known to vary , at least in the local universe , due to variations in dust composition and dust size distribution .",
    "dust grains can grow to larger sizes as the density of the gas to which they are mixed increases , leading to a larger ratio of visual extinction to reddening @xmath104 ( maiolino & natta 2002 and references therein ) . at larger lookback times as well , such variations in environment may cause the extinction curve to vary between galaxies of different type . along these lines ,",
    "reddy et al . ( 2010 ) recently argued that young @xmath32 galaxies with ages @xmath105 myr may follow an extinction curve that is different from calzetti , and instead more smc - like .    here , we briefly consider how our results would change when adopting the smc reddening law from prvot et al .",

    "naturally , when adopting the smc law , less dust ( i.e. , a smaller @xmath102 ) is needed to reproduce the observed uv spectral slope .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that without imposing an ad hoc constraint on the minimum @xmath67 , the best - fit @xmath67 and age distribution are less skewed towards short @xmath67 and young ages . for the same weak constraints on @xmath67 ( @xmath106 ) , we find that the underestimate of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 is reduced to 0 - 0.2 dex at low @xmath107 when adopting the smc law . at high sfrs on the other hand ,",
    "the discrepancy becomes worse . in terms of @xmath70 ,",
    "half of the low @xmath108 systems are better fit with a smc law than a calzetti law , while above @xmath109 this fraction drops to 20% .    from the comparison to @xmath10 and the relative distribution of @xmath110 values , we thus conclude that our results are at least qualitatively consistent with a scenario where steeper extinction curves are appropriate for lower sfr systems .",
    "physically , this may stem from a dust grain distribution that is biased to small sizes in these environments that are typically of lower gas density . for simplicity , consistency with previous work , and because a good sfr calibration can be obtained provided an appropriate @xmath76 ( see section  [ sedvsuvir.sec ] )",

    "the presence of any discrepancies could hint at ill - characterized sfhs , breaking of number conservation by merging , or cosmic variance leading to one redshift interval being under- or overdense with respect to the other .",
    "we first perform the above described galaxy population analysis adopting exponentially declining sfhs with a large range of allowed e - folding timescales ( @xmath141 myr ) . in figure[trace2d.fig]a , we contrast the observed sfr - m relation ( _ red _ ) to that inferred from the sed modeled sfhs of galaxies in the previous redshift bin ( _ black _ ) .",
    "the black and red symbols were plotted in a random order , in order to preserve information on the relative abundance of the two populations , even in crowded regions of the diagram .",
    "at all redshifts , the backtraced model matches the observed main sequence of star formation reasonably well in terms of zeropoint , slope , and scatter .",
    "in particular , even though @xmath67 models by definition do not allow for increasing sfrs , the upwards shift of the main sequence from @xmath142 to @xmath143 is captured by the model .",
    "as is empirically well established , galaxies with lower specific star formation rates exist alongside normal star - forming galaxies at least out to @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , labb et al . 2005 ; kriek et al .",
    "their relative abundance is an increasing function of galaxy mass , and declines with increasing redshift ( fontana et al .",
    "we note that , while these quiescent systems are abundantly present at @xmath137 , they are missing from the backtraced population computed for that redshift bin .",
    "galaxies with similarly low specific star formation are present in our @xmath138 sample .",
    "this suggests that we are not merely missing the descendants of @xmath137 quiescent galaxies due to the smaller volume probed at @xmath138 . in general",

    "( 2009 ) , whose analysis was partly based on the same data set , we observe fairly little evolution in number density at the high - mass ( @xmath144 ) end , compared to a steeper build - up of stellar mass with cosmic time in the intermediate ( @xmath145 ) regime .",
    "we did not correct the observed mass functions for incompleteness .",
    "instead , we apply the @xmath146 observed magnitude limit of the fireworks catalog to the galaxies that were evolved back in time , leading to the dashed curves in figure  [ trace1d.fig]a .",
    "this approach allows for a fair comparison as long as galaxies higher - z progenitors have fainter observed @xmath93-band magnitudes than their descendants at the epoch of observation .",
    "figure  [ trace1d.fig]a clearly shows that the backtraced population , as based on sed modeling with @xmath67 models with a large freedom in @xmath67 , is underpopulated .",
    "the underestimate of the number densities increases with decreasing stellar mass , becoming dramatic at intermediate masses , particularly for the lower redshift bins , where it exceeds an order of magnitude . as we will see in section[merging.sec ] , such large differences in number density are unlikely to result from merging of galaxies alone , a process that we ignored so far in our analysis .",
    "an underdensity of the goods - south field in the @xmath138 interval ( wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) may contribute to the offset seen between the observed and backtraced @xmath137 population .",
    "however , the same trend is seen at all redshifts .",
    "this can not be due solely to field - to - field variations unless each redshift bin is underdense relative to the one above .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the offsets seems incompatible with field - to - field variations . following the methodology of somerville et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the expected uncertainty due to cosmic variance on the number density of @xmath147 galaxies at @xmath138 , @xmath137 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 as derived from the goods - south field is 34 , 24 , 26 and 32% respectively , much smaller than the discrepancies between the observed and backtraced populations in figure  [ trace1d.fig]a . the most straightforward interpretation is therefore that the sed modeled stellar populations are biased towards young stellar ages . given an underestimated age , we would infer the stellar mass of a galaxy to be built up relatively recently . or in other words , as we trace this galaxy back in time , its stellar mass would decrease too rapidly , leading to a lower formation redshift at which the galaxy drops out of the backtraced sample .",
    "the origin of such age underestimates lies most plausibly in the fact that younger stellar populations outshine any underlying old population in the integrated sed , especially at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "because of this outshining effect , any deviation from the simple sfh and foreground dust distribution assumed makes it impossible to correctly recover the true sfr - weighted age ( wuyts et al .",
    "2009a ; maraston et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "somewhat earlier formation epochs are obtained when requiring longer e - folding timescales of @xmath148 myr . since this also provided a better agreement between sfr indicators ( section[sedvsuvir.sec ] ) , we adopt this value of @xmath76 in the remainder of our analysis . in the median",
    ", the sfr - weighted age of the galaxies in our sample then increases by 0.15 dex .",
    "the high - mass end of the observed and backtraced mass functions now show a good agreement ( figure  [ trace1d.fig]b ) . at lower masses ,",
    "the offsets remain present , although reduced by a few 0.1 dex .",
    "the mass dependence of the offsets may imply that age underestimates are more of a concern for low- to intermediate - mass galaxies than for the most massive ( often older ) systems .",
    "recently , several authors have argued , both on observational ( renzini et al . 2009 ; maraston et al .",

    "2011 ) and on theoretical ( finlator et al . 2007 ;",
    "lee et al .",
    "2010 ) grounds , that galaxies may undergo increasing , rather than decreasing , sfhs during parts of their life , specifically at early times ( @xmath149 ) . to allow for such phases of increasing sfr without imposing an artificial breakdown of our galaxy sample in sources fitted with strictly increasing",
    "versus sources fitted with strictly decreasing sfhs , we repeated our analysis using the following sfh :    @xmath150    these so - called delayed @xmath67 models allow for solutions with increasing sfrs ( for ages @xmath151 ) as well as solutions in which the sfr is decreasing after a prior phase during which it was increasing ( for ages @xmath152 ) . at @xmath153 , @xmath154 for delayed @xmath67 models as opposed to @xmath155 for simple @xmath67 models .",

    "the latter vary between this slope of a half and a slope of unity .",
    "its precise value is still widely debated ( noeske et al .",

    "overall , only 20 % of the galaxies is best characterized by being observed during a phase in which the sfr is increasing ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "however , this fraction is a strong function of the level of star - forming activity ( and therefore redshift ) . at sfrs above 10 , 50 , and 100 @xmath159 , galaxies that are best fit by rising sfrs account for 40 , 60 , and 70% of the overall population . at @xmath160 , 37% of the galaxies in our @xmath161 sample",
    "are found to be in the rising part of their sfh ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) .",
    "we note that the reduced chi - square ( @xmath162 ) values of the fits with delayed @xmath67 models are indistinguishable from those obtained by fitting simple @xmath67 models .",
    "the sfr - weighted ages are in the median 0.1 dex older than those inferred from simple @xmath67 models , with a scatter of 0.15 dex , and a weak trend with age ( the systematic offset being smaller for systems that formed the bulk of their stars more than a gyr ago ) . despite the modest increase in estimated ages ,",
    "it is clear from figure  [ trace2d.fig]c and[trace1d.fig]c that the underestimate of galaxy number densities at intermediate masses remains significant for this alternative sfh . in other words , in the absence of any stringent constraints on age , the delayed @xmath67 models are subject to the same outshining effect as were the simple @xmath67 models .",
    "finally , we repeat the population analysis once more , now making the assumption that all galaxies are maximally old ( i.e. , @xmath163 ) . the sfr - weighted age @xmath129 may ( and will ) still be younger than the age of the universe at the epoch of observation , but we perform the sed modeling forcing the onset of star formation to take place at very high redshift . given the discreteness in age of stellar population models , small variations in the adopted @xmath164 occur depending on the galaxy s precise redshift , but it is typically around @xmath165 and the precise value is irrelevant for this exercise .",
    "we again adopt delayed @xmath67 models , as they result in @xmath166 values that are better by a factor of @xmath167 than those obtained from fitting simple @xmath67 models with the same restriction on @xmath164 . in practice",
    ", the least squares solution is now often one with @xmath168 ( see the abundance of galaxies with @xmath169 in figure  [ agetau.fig]b ) , such that the sfr - weighted age is minimized within the allowed range that goes from 0.5 ( for @xmath170 ) to 1 ( for @xmath171 ) times the age of the universe at the observed epoch .",
    "these long e - folding times , obtained when maximizing the formation redshift , serve not to violate the constraints from the longer wavelengths on stellar mass , which tends to be the most robust parameter in sed modeling ( e.g. , frster schreiber et al . 2004 ; shapley et al .",
    "nevertheless , we do note that the median stellar mass of galaxies in our sample increases by 0.25 dex compared to sed modeling where no maximum formation redshift was imposed .",
    "although extreme , the assumption of maximally old galaxies is useful as a sanity check .",
    "if the backtraced galaxy samples are still underpopulated with respect to the observed samples , the origin of the discrepancy must most likely be attributed to other effects such as merging , cosmic variance , or more extreme sfhs in which an even larger fraction of the stellar mass was assembled at very early times .",
    "figure  [ trace1d.fig]d shows that this is not the case .",
    "at all redshifts , the backtraced mass functions match the observed mass functions surprisingly well , and are if anything slightly overproducing the number densities in some mass bins ( an effect that is somewhat more pronounced if we had adopted simple @xmath67 models , that lead to even older sfr - weighted ages ) .",
    "we note that the sfr - m relation ( figure  [ trace2d.fig]d ) has tightened significantly by making the rigorous assumption on early formation epochs .",
    "this indicates that , aside from an intrinsic scatter owing to galaxy - to - galaxy differences in sfh , the scatter in the observed sfr - m relation also depends on model assumptions .",
    "likewise , we find that conclusions on the differential evolution of the stellar mass function also depend on the assumed sfh . when making similar assumptions about the sfh as marchesini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we confirm their finding of little evolution at the high - mass end , and much more at lower masses ( see figure  [ trace1d.fig]b ) .",
    "when instead using delayed tau models in combination with tight constraints on the formation redshifts , the degree of such differential evolution reduces significantly ( see figure  [ trace1d.fig]d ) .",
    "so far , we assumed that each observed galaxy had only one progenitor that assembled its stellar mass by in situ star formation . in a hierarchical universe , where dark matter haloes merge to form increasingly larger structures , carrying with them the baryons that assembled at the centers of their potential wells",
    ", our simplified toy model must therefore fail to capture the detailed evolution of galaxy populations at some level . in order to properly account for galaxies merging ( or in fact de - merging as we trace them back in time ) , an accurate knowledge of the merger rate as function of redshift , mass , and mass ratio would be required . moreover",
    ", the probability that a galaxy observed at redshift @xmath172 underwent a merger since redshift @xmath173 ( and hence has to be split in two as we trace it back to that epoch ) may not only depend on its mass .",
    "for example , if merging leads to quenching ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2005 ) , a quiescent galaxy may be more likely to have undergone a merger in its past than a star - forming galaxy of similar mass .",
    "furthermore , it is well motivated that mergers between gas - rich systems trigger starbursts in their centers , which inhibits evolving galaxies back along smooth tracks in the sfr - m diagram .",
    "in fact , the scatter in the sfr - m relation of star - forming galaxies may well be produced by such burstiness , triggered by ( minor ) mergers or other processes .",
    "clearly , implementing all of these processes in our consistency check is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore choose to illustrate the effect of merging activity on our analysis by two models of increasing complexity .",
    "the first is an idealized toy model , presented in figure[merging.fig ] .",
    "here , the black curve represents a hypothetical mass function at @xmath173 as traced back from galaxies observed at @xmath172 .",
    "the dotted line accounts for the magnitude limit of our catalog .",
    "if every galaxy observed at @xmath172 underwent one merger in the interval @xmath174 ( for simplicity we assume one that did not affect the sfh ) , the actual number of progenitors will be twice as large as anticipated in the absence of merging . since the mass distribution of progenitors",
    "will be shifted to lower values , the number of galaxies entering our magnitude - limited catalog will be larger by a somewhat smaller factor . under the assumption of a merger rate that is a constant function of the mass ratio over the range 10:1 to 2:1 ,",
    "the resulting mass function is plotted in green .",
    "if all of these merger progenitors themselves descended from mergers taking place since @xmath173 , the red curve would be the backtraced population ( consisting of four times as many galaxies as observed at @xmath172 , ignoring incompleteness issues ) .",
    "the net effect is a steepening of the mass function , the magnitude of which depends on the amplitude of the merger rate .",
    "while conceptually demonstrating the impact of merging , our toy model does not contain information on the frequency of galaxy collisions , and therefore its conclusions remain qualitative at best . in order to obtain a more quantitative estimate",
    ", we turn to a second , more physically motivated model in figure  [ sam.fig ] . here",
    ", the solid lines mark the galaxy stellar mass functions at a range of redshifts as extracted from the munich semi - analytic model ( sam ) of galaxy formation by de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) .",
    "the sam is rooted in the pure dark matter millennium simulation ( springel et al . 2005 ) , and hence incorporates the hierarchical mass build - up characteristic for a @xmath175-cdm cosmology .",
    "it furthermore contains a set of prescriptions to model the baryonic physics within this framework , and outputs among other parameters the observed - frame photometry , which we use to apply the @xmath93-band magnitude limit of the observations . here",
    ", we will not focus on differences between the model and observed mass functions ( most notably a relatively late build - up of the high - mass end and early build - up of the low - mass end in the sam ) , these are discussed at length by marchesini et al .",
    "instead , we use the sam with its physically motivated merger rates as a self - consistent testbed to constrain the impact of merging activity .    since the merger tree of each galaxy is stored , it is trivial to perform our analysis from section  [ methodology.sec ] on the sam , i.e. , to evolve galaxies back in time according to their sfh ignoring merging .",
    "for example , to obtain the inferred population at @xmath176 by winding back the clock from @xmath177 , we simply group all @xmath176 galaxies that have a common descendant at @xmath177 , sum their masses , and construct the mass function from the resulting sample ( _ red dashed line in figure  [ sam.fig]_ ) . in the sam , by construction , any difference between the backtraced and actual mass function at a given redshift is due to merging . as expected from our simplistic toy model ( figure  [ merging.fig ] ) , the net effect of including merging is a steepening of the mass function : while the high - mass end is reduced , the number density at intermediate masses increases by 0.25 dex , 0.15 dex and 0 dex at @xmath177 , 2.5 and 3.5 respectively .",
    "we conclude that accounting for mergers will reduce the discrepancy in number densities seen in section  [ tracingback.sec ] at low to intermediate masses , but typical merger rates from dark matter + semi - analytic models seem insufficient to fully resolve the underdensities we found .",
    "invoking more active merger histories would break down the good agreement at the high - mass end ( @xmath178 ) by suppressing the abundance of those galaxies . given these concerns",
    ", we now turn to what is likely a major contributor to the offsets between the observed and backtraced mass functions in figure  [ trace1d.fig]a-c : biases in characterizing the galaxy - averaged stellar age .      in section  [ tracingback.sec ]",
    ", we found that the backtraced and observed mass functions over a wide range of redshifts matched better when forcing maximally old ages in the sed modeling .",
    "although merging and stochastic bursts will undoubtly affect the evolutionary tracks of galaxies in the sfr - m diagram , it seems unlikely that they can account for the discrepancies observed when leaving formation redshifts as a free parameter in the sed modeling .",
    "we therefore turn to the measurement of galaxy ages , and discuss two avenues for improvement .",
    "first , it is illustrative to contrast the best - fit stellar population models with and without the constraint of a maximally early onset of star formation .",
    "the top two panels in figure[free_vs_maxold.fig ] show the seds of two quiescent galaxies at @xmath179 , while the bottom three panels represent cases at the same redshift of galaxies populating the main sequence of star formation .",
    "irrespective of galaxy type , we note that both the free age and the maximally old best - fit model reproduces the broad - band seds remarkably well . by and large ,",
    "the two templates are indistinguishable for broad - band tracers , except at rest - frame wavelengths shortward of 0.2 @xmath2 m , and to a lesser extent at the longest wavelengths probed ( @xmath180 m ) .",
    "present - day stellar population synthesis codes are facing the largest differences in the latter regime ( maraston 2005 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that more stringent constraints on the @xmath181 m sed , from deep fuv , nuv , and @xmath1-band observations , would help most to better constrain galaxy stellar ages without the need to impose ad hoc constraints on formation redshifts .",
    "rettura et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , among others , recognize this , and succesfully exploit rest - frame uv data of @xmath182 ellipticals in clusters and field environments to constrain both their onset and timescale of star formation .      a second avenue for improvement concerns not so much the wavelength range , but rather the scales probed with multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "the outshining effect that limits our ability to constrain galaxy ages results from an older , underlying stellar population whose existence is not captured by the best - fit sfh because the sed is dominated by the younger and less obscured part of the stellar population .",
    "if such multiple components of the galaxy s sfh are spatially disjoint , as might be expected , we may bypass or at least reduce the outshining effect by means of resolved sed modeling .",
    "the advent of the wfc3 camera onboard hst , in concert with the long - time workhorse acs , opens a window on such analyses .",
    "wuyts et al .",
    "( in prep ) present in detail the implications of resolved stellar populations at high redshift , but for our present purpose we focus solely on the estimate of sfr - weighted ages ( i.e. , the age of the bulk of the stars ) . here",
    ", we use the wfc3 @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath83 data of the early release science ( ers ) program as testbed , in combination with acs @xmath91 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath92 data in goods - south matched to the same resolution ( 0.16 `` , sampled by a 0.06''/pix drizzled pixelscale ) . for a sample of 282 galaxies with @xmath187 and @xmath33 , we perform a default sed modeling analysis on the summed bvizyjh photometry of all galaxy pixels with @xmath188 .",
    "we ignore any aperture corrections , which may well be important for estimates of , e.g. , total stellar mass if a substantial fraction of the galaxy mass resides in the outskirts where pixels have @xmath189 .",
    "however , it is irrelevant for our present discussion on galaxy age and how its estimate depends on an integrated versus resolved approach , because in both cases we work with the same set of pixels ( namely those with @xmath188 ) .",
    "next , we run the sed modeling procedure on a pixel - by - pixel basis , yielding a best - fit mass , age , @xmath67 , and @xmath102 for each object pixel individually .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the recent study by zibetti , charlot & rix 2009 who spatially resolve the stellar populations in nearby galaxies ( obviously to scales much smaller than probed in our high - redshift sample ) .",
    "we confirm that the sum of all best - fit templates from the pixel - by - pixel analysis provides an excellent match to the integrated galaxy sed . in figure",
    "[ resolv.fig ] , we compare the sfr - weighted age obtained from pixel - by - pixel sed modeling to that preferred by fitting one @xmath67 model to the integrated galaxy photometry . here , the sfr - weighted age inferred from resolved sed modeling is computed following equation  [ agew.eq ] , but the effective sfh over which one integrates is now not a simple @xmath67 model , but the superposition of @xmath67 models , each with their own normalization , @xmath67 and age , for each of the object pixels . we observe a clear trend of increased inferred stellar ages , ranging from 0 to 2 orders of magnitude , when adopting a resolved sed modeling approach .",
    "the offsets are small for galaxies where integrated sed modeling indicates old stellar populations and low sfrs , specific sfrs , and visual extinctions . for systems where younger ages , and higher sfrs , sfr / m , and @xmath102",
    "are inferred from integrated sed modeling , the age correction factors exhibit a large scatter .",
    "formally , the offsets correlate most strongly with galaxy age .",
    "we derive a mean correction @xmath190 with a scatter increasing from 0.1 dex for the systems with the oldest @xmath191 to 0.4 dex for those with the youngest @xmath191 .",
    "this behavior may partially be driven by the condition that the time since the onset of star formation must be less than the age of the universe at the epoch of observation ( galaxies with old @xmath192 already lie close to this upper bound ) .",
    "we do find only a very weak correlation with angular size ( i.e. , the number of independent resolution elements in which the galaxies are resolved ) , a property that itself correlates , at a given mass , with star formation activity ( franx et al . 2008 ; toft et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in order to rule out any systematic biases by fitting to the low s / n seds of individual pixels",
    ", we applied the same integrated and resolved sed modeling procedure to a set of 500 mock galaxies with a uniform stellar population and representative stellar masses , sizes , and @xmath83-band pixel flux distributions .",
    "our toy galaxies vary in e - folding time between 30 myr and 3 gyr , in the time since the onset of star formation between 100 myr and the age of the universe , and were attenuated by a uniform visual extinction of @xmath193 .",
    "we computed their broad - band seds as observed at @xmath194 , and disturbed the pixel fluxes appropriately according to the pixel - to - pixel rms of the real data .",
    "we confirm that both the integrated and resolved sed modeling methods correctly recover the input sfr - weighted ages , to within a few percent .",
    "the central 68th percentile interval of the @xmath195 distribution broadens by 35% for resolved compared to integrated sed modeling , but no systematic bias is introduced by the method . based on this sanity check , we can state with confidence that the systematic offsets observed for the ers2 galaxies are due to real spatial variations in their stellar populations .",
    "given the limited resolution , we can only account for differences in sfh across the largest galaxy - wide scales .",
    "the outshining may well remain present on scales below the resolution of the wfc3 imaging ( 0.16 `` fwhm , corresponding to 1.3 kpc at @xmath194 , sampled by drizzled pixels of 0.06 '' ) .",
    "we note that the effective visual attenuation @xmath196 , computed as @xmath197 also increases when performing resolved sed modeling , by @xmath198 mag . this technique may therefore help to alleviate both the outshining effect and the saturation of reddening by patchy dust obscuration ( see section  [ sedvsuvir.sec ] ) .",
    "obviously , its use is limited to special data sets rich in multi - wavelength high - resolution imaging .",
    "finally , despite the strong observed trends , we caution that sed modeling on an individual pixel basis is still subject to the same age - dust degeneracy that is well - known from integrated sed modeling , particularly when based on the relatively narrow observed @xmath91-to-@xmath83 wavelength baseline .",
    "we compared sfr indicators out to redshift @xmath39 relying on pacs far - infrared , mips 24 @xmath2 m , and uv emission , @xmath1-to-8 @xmath2 m sed modeling , as well as h@xmath27 spectroscopy .",

    "et al . ( 2011b ) , we exploit this continuity across sfr indicators in concert with high - resolution hst imaging to address the relation between the level and mode of star formation , and its mass dependence .    using the deeper pep data in goods - south , we confirm previous reports by nordon et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and elbaz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that luminosity - dependent conversions from observed 24 @xmath2 m to @xmath4 based on the ce01 and dh02 template libraries lead to overestimated @xmath4 ( and hence sfrs ) at the highest sfrs ( @xmath199 ) and redshifts ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this trend is also consistent with early findings by papovich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) on the basis of stacking of mips 70 @xmath2 m and 160 @xmath2 m data .",
    "using the luminosity - independent conversion by w08 , which is based on a template with enhanced pah emission relative to local ulirgs , gives @xmath4 based on 24 @xmath2 m that are in the median consistent with pacs photometry , although with a 0.25 dex scatter .",
    "sed modeling recipes can be tuned to reproduce @xmath10 for systems with low to intermediate sfrs ( e.g. , by adjusting the minimum allowed e - folding time for exponentially declining sfhs ) .",
    "the relatively long ( at least several 100 myr ) e - folding times required for sed modeling with bc03 to match @xmath10 implies that most star formation happened in a relatively stable mode , varying slowly on timescales that correspond to of order @xmath85 dynamical times .",
    "galaxies at the high sfr end ( @xmath200 ) tend to be dusty , and are increasingly common toward high redshifts .",
    "simple dust correction methods assuming a uniform foreground screen fail to recover their total amount of star formation . due to the patchiness of the dust distribution in these objects , reddening saturates as a tracer of extinction .",
    "this bias applies to sed modeling as well as methods based on single colors , that are designed for a specific ( high ) redshift range ( daddi et al .",
    "at the low sfr end , we find a hint of steeper , more smc - like extinction curves than the calzetti et al .",

    "<S> we compare multi - wavelength star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators out to @xmath0 in the goods - south field . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis uniquely combines @xmath1-to-8@xmath2 m photometry from fireworks , mips 24 @xmath2 m and pacs 70 , 100 , and 160 @xmath2 m photometry from the pep survey , and @xmath3 spectroscopy from the sins survey . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a set of conversions that lead to a continuity across sfr indicators . a luminosity - independent conversion from 24 @xmath2 m to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of @xmath4 that are in the median consistent with the @xmath4 derived from pacs photometry , albeit with significant scatter . </S>",
    "<S> dust correction methods perform well at low to intermediate levels of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> they fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large @xmath5 ratios , typically occuring at the highest sfrs ( @xmath6 ) and redshifts ( @xmath7 ) probed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we confirm that @xmath3-based sfrs at @xmath8 are consistent with @xmath9 and @xmath10 provided extra attenuation towards hii regions is taken into account ( @xmath11 ) . with the cross - calibrated sfr indicators in hand , we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from sed modeling . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed sfr - m relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backwards in time . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied in sed modeling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how resolved sed modeling , or alternatively deep uv data , may help to overcome this bias . </S>",
    "<S> the age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations , and reduces towards older systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our analysis suggests that sfhs typically vary on timescales that are long ( at least several 100 myr ) compared to the galaxies dynamical time . </S>"
