    "the production of electroweak gauge bosons , e.g.  @xmath2 and @xmath1 bosons , is one of the most prominent processes at hadron colliders . especially through their leptonic",
    "decays they leave a clean signature , namely either one charged lepton accompanied by missing energy for @xmath0 bosons or two oppositely charged leptons for the @xmath1 bosons .",
    "the combination of clear signatures and copious production rates allows a measurement of some of their parameters , e.g.  the @xmath0 mass and width , with a precision comparable with that reached at lep2 at the tevatron @xcite , or even better at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the same combination , clear signature and large production rate , renders them a good candidate process for luminosity measurements , especially at the lhc @xcite .",
    "this holds true in particular for @xmath0-bosons , since their production rate is enhanced by roughly an order of magnitude with respect to @xmath1 production .",
    "furthermore , especially in combination with additional jets , the production of gauge bosons represents a serious background to many other interesting processes , leading to multi particle final state topologies .",
    "the production and decay of pairs of top quarks or of susy particles may serve as illustrative examples for such signal processes .",
    "the special interest in this classic production process is reflected by the fact that it was one of the first to be calculated at next - to leading order ( nlo ) @xcite and next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite in qcd .",
    "recently , the first distribution related to these processes , namely the boson rapidity , has been calculated at nnlo @xcite .",
    "in addition to such fixed - order calculations , programs such as resbos @xcite have been made available , which resum soft gluon effects .",
    "cross sections and distributions for @xmath0 or @xmath1 bosons being produced together with jets can be evaluated at the parton level through a number of different computer codes : specialised ones such as vecbos @xcite , and multi - purpose parton - level generators such as comphep @xcite , grace / gr@ppa @xcite , madgraph / madevent @xcite , alpgen @xcite , and amegic @xcite .",
    "all of them operate at the tree level , at nlo the program mcfm @xcite provides cross sections and distributions for @xmath3jets for up to 2 jets .    apart from such techniques , based on analytical methods ,",
    "event generators play a major role in the experimental analysis of collider experiments . in the past years",
    ", programs such as pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite proved to be successful in describing global features of boson production processes , such as the bosons transverse momentum or rapidity distribution .",
    "apart from the parton shower , which takes proper care and resums the leading and some of the subleading sudakov logarithms , these programs include the first - order matrix element for the emission of an extra parton , implemented through a correction weight on the parton shower .",
    "because of the different approximations made for their parton shower , this is realized in different manners inside the two programs , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    in view of the need for more precise simulations , both in terms of total rates and in the description of exclusive final states ,",
    "two quite orthogonal approaches have been developed recently , which aim at a systematic combination of higher - order matrix elements with the parton shower .",
    "the first one , called mc@nlo , provides a method to consistently match nlo calculations for specific processes with the parton shower .",
    "it has been implemented for the production of colour - singlet final states , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons , or pairs of these bosons @xcite , or the higgs boson , and for the production of heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "the implementations are available as a code called mc@nlo @xcite residing on top of herwig .",
    "the idea of this approach is to organise the counter - terms necessary to technically cancel real and virtual infrared divergencies in such a way that the first emission of the parton shower is recovered .",
    "this allows the generation of hard kinematics configurations , which can eventually be fed into a parton shower monte carlo .",
    "the alternative approach is to employ matrix elements at the tree level ( at leading order ) for different jet multiplicities and to merge them with the parton shower .",
    "the basic idea in this approach is to define a region of jet production , i.e.  hard emissions , and a region of jet evolution , i.e.  soft emissions , divided by a @xmath4-type of jet measure @xcite .",
    "leading higher - order effects are added to the various matrix elements by reweighting them with appropriate sudakov form factors .",
    "formal independence at leading logarithmic order of the overall result on the jet measure is achieved by vetoing hard emissions inside the parton shower , and suitable starting conditions .",
    "this approach was presented for the first time @xcite for @xmath5 collisions ; it has been reformulated for dipole cascades in @xcite and extended to hadronic collisions in @xcite .",
    "the method is one of the cornerstones of the new event generator sherpa   @xcite , written entirely in c++ , where it has been consistently implemented for nearly arbitrary processes .",
    "a case study of this method on the basis of pythia and herwig , focusing on single - boson production , has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted also that a somewhat related approach has been taken by @xcite .",
    "there , a systematic mapping and tracing of partons stemming from the leading order matrix element through the parton shower takes proper care of leading logarithmic effects .",
    "the goal of this paper is to validate the merging procedure implemented in sherpa  for single - boson production and to compare the results with those of other approaches .",
    "after a short reminder of the merging procedure and a brief introduction to some of the implementation details in sec .",
    "[ remp ] , the focus will shift on results obtained by sherpa .",
    "the observables , that will be studied , are inclusive , like the transverse momentum and rapidity distribution of the bosons , and more exclusive , like the transverse momentum distribution of additional jets . in a first step ,",
    "the self - consistency of the method will be checked by analysing the dependence of different observables on the separation cut and on the maximal number of extra jets provided by the matrix elements , see sec .",
    "[ self - c ] . following this the results of the merging method will be contrasted with those of other approaches : on the matrix element level , the jet transverse momentum distributions of sherpas reweighted matrix elements will be compared with those of a full - fledged nlo calculation provided by mcfm ; see sec .",
    "[ ssec_vsmc ] .",
    "then , the results after parton showering and hadronisation will be compared with those of other event generators in sec .",
    "[ ssec_vsmcatnlo ] , specifically with those obtained from pythia and mc@nlo .",
    "finally , the ability of the method to describe inclusive observables that have been measured , such as the bosons transverse momentum , will be exhibited in sec .",
    "[ ssec_vsdata ] .",
    "the key idea of the merging procedure @xcite is to separate the phase space for parton emission into a hard region of jet production accounted for by suitable tree - level matrix elements and the softer region of jet evolution covered by the parton showers .",
    "then , extra weights are applied on the former and vetoes on the latter , so that the overall dependence on the separation cut is minimal .",
    "the separation is achieved through a @xmath4-measure ; for hadron collisions a longitudinal invariant form is used @xcite : two final state particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined to be within two different jets , if their relative @xmath4-measure @xmath8 , given by @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ] is larger than the jet resolution scale @xmath10 . in the context of the merging procedure , this scale @xmath10 serves as the separation scale between the regimes of jet production and jet evolution . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the pseudo - rapidities and azimuthal angles of the two particles , respectively .",
    "in addition , each jet has to fulfil the constraint that @xmath13 is larger than the jet resolution scale .",
    "apart from details concerning the merging of two jets into one , variations of this jet definition exist .",
    "for instance , within the @xmath4-scheme for tevatron , run ii , the @xmath14 are eventually rescaled by a `` cone - like '' factor @xmath15 , and instead of the cosines just the squares of the differences are taken @xcite .",
    "the weight attached to the matrix elements takes into account the terms that would appear in a corresponding parton shower evolution .",
    "therefore , a `` shower history '' is reconstructed by clustering the initial and final state particles stemming from the tree - level matrix element according to the @xmath4-formalism .",
    "this procedure yields nodal values , namely the different @xmath4-measures @xmath16 where two jets have been merged into one .",
    "these nodal values can be interpreted as the relative transverse momentum describing the jet production or the parton splitting .",
    "the four - vectors of the mergers are given by the sum of their two offsprings , leading to increasingly massive jets .",
    "the first ingredients of the me weight are the strong coupling constants evaluated at the respective nodal values of the various parton splittings , divided by the value of the strong coupling constant as used in the evaluation of the matrix element . in general , in the matrix element calculation , the jet resolution scale is taken to be the renormalisation scale as well as the factorisation scale , guaranteeing that the weight is always smaller than 1 .",
    "this allows a simple hit - or - miss method to yield unweighted events .",
    "the other part of the correction weight is provided by sudakov form factors . at",
    "next - to leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy the quark and gluon sudakov form factors are given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath17\\right\\ } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 branching probabilities @xmath22 a sudakov form factor yields the probability for no emission ( resolvable at scale @xmath23 ) during the evolution from a higher scale @xmath24 to a lower scale @xmath23 .",
    "the ratio of two sudakov form factors @xmath25 then gives the probability for no emission resolvable at a scale @xmath23 during the evolution from @xmath24 to @xmath26 .",
    "having reweighted the matrix element , a smooth transition between this and the parton shower region must be guaranteed .",
    "this is achieved by choosing suitable starting conditions for the shower evolution of the parton ensemble . in particular , the starting scale of the shower evolution of a certain parton is not the jet resolution scale @xmath27 , but rather the production scale of that parton",
    ". then a veto on any emission harder than @xmath27 properly separates the shower regime from the matrix element region .",
    "the extension of the merging algorithm to hadronic initial states has been proposed in @xcite for the first time . here , this algorithm will be briefly reviewed , with special emphasis on details of its implementation in the sherpa  framework .",
    "the description of the preferred scale choice for different configurations , details of the treatment of matrix elements with the highest jet multiplicity , and the solution to the problem of how to introduce off - shellness to on - shell matrix element particles will be considered in the following sections .",
    "the merging algorithm proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "[ begin_algo ] one process out of all processes under consideration is selected according to the probability @xmath28 this choice provides the initial jet rates , subject to an additional sudakov and coupling weight rejection .",
    "for instance , a typical selection of processes for @xmath29-boson production would include : @xmath30 the cross sections @xmath31 are calculated using the corresponding tree - level matrix elements ; the only phase - space restriction is given by the @xmath4-measure . the renormalisation scale @xmath32 and the factorisation scale @xmath33",
    "are fixed to the cut - off scale @xmath27 , with an exception only for the process with the highest number of jets , cf .",
    "[ sec_highest_multi ] .",
    "having chosen a single process , the respective momenta are distributed according to the corresponding differential cross section .",
    "[ step_cluster ] the nodal values @xmath34 are determined .",
    "in doing so a corresponding parton shower history is reconstructed .",
    "the backward clustering procedure is guided by the @xmath4-measure , respecting additional constraints : * unphysical combinations like ( @xmath35 ) and ( @xmath36 ) are ignored . within the sherpa  framework",
    "this is implemented by employing the knowledge of the feynman diagrams contributing to the process under consideration .",
    "thus , `` unphysical '' translates into the non - existence of a corresponding feynman amplitude .",
    "* when an outgoing parton of momentum @xmath37 is to be clustered with a beam , the @xmath4-measure does not provide the information as to which beam it has to be clustered . in general the beam with the same sign as its longitudinal momentum component is preferred .",
    "in addition the new momentum given by @xmath38 must exhibit a positive energy in the frame where the initial state shower is performed .",
    "the backward clustering stops with a @xmath39 process .",
    "the hardest scale of this `` core '' process has to be found .",
    "it depends both on the process and its kinematics ( cf",

    "a factor @xmath42 is added . * for every qcd node a factor @xmath43 is added .",

    "[ fig_w2jet]c ) .",
    "since the `` core '' process is not resolved , there is only one scale available , @xmath57 , the transverse momentum of the outgoing jets .",
    "the correction weight consequently reads : @xmath58 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{\\alpha_s(q)}{\\alpha_s(q_{\\rm cut})}\\right]^2\\,.\\ ] ]    the extension to higher multiplicities is straightforward .",
    "however , the number of extra jets accounted for by matrix elements is limited .",
    "this limitation in available mes enforces a specific treatment of the processes with the highest multiplicity .      in general ,",
    "the initial cross sections @xmath31 used in step [ begin_algo ] of the merging algorithm above are defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the appropriate invariant phase - space element and @xmath61 is the feynman amplitude for the respective process .",
    "the choice @xmath62 together with the sudakov factors and the coupling weight leads to a modified cross section @xmath63 . adding all cross sections with the same number of strong particles yields the cross section for production processes accompanied by  exclusively ",
    "@xmath64 jets , @xmath65 of course the number of extra jets that can be considered in this respect is limited by the available matrix elements ; in sherpa , this number is usually in the range of three to four . in order to compensate for",
    "all the omitted processes with more jets , the treatment of processes with the highest number of extra jets differs slightly from the handling of lower jet multiplicities .",
    "the changes are as follows :    * the factorisation scale is set dynamically to @xmath66 , i.e.  to the smallest nodal value as determined by the @xmath4-algorithm , * the resolution scale @xmath27 of the sudakov weights is also replaced by @xmath67 , and * the shower veto is applied with @xmath67 instead of @xmath27 .",
    "this guarantees that parton showers attached to matrix elements with the highest number of jets are allowed to produce softer jets . in other words : the merging procedure is meant to take into account quantum interference effects in jet production at leading order up to a maximal number of jets ; any softer jet is left to the parton shower . for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_w2jet]a ) , the modified sudakov and coupling weight reads : @xmath68 with lowest scale @xmath69 .",
    "following this procedure , the sum of all cross sections @xmath70 for a number of jets @xmath64 can be interpreted as an inclusive cross section @xmath71 i.e.  the probability to find at least @xmath64 jets . adding all exclusive cross sections for multiplicities lower than a maximal multiplicity @xmath72 to the inclusive cross section for the highest multiplicity results in a fully inclusive cross section .      one subtle problem when combining matrix elements with parton showers is connected to the question of how to translate the matrix element kinematics , determined with on - shell ( for light quarks",
    "usually massless ) momenta , into a kinematics suitable for the virtuality - ordered parton shower , i.e.  invoking off - shell momenta . within the sherpa  framework ,",
    "this problem is dealt with by the parton shower in the usual fashion : to begin with , the energy fraction @xmath73 is determined from on - shell kinematics , and afterwards it is reinterpreted . for details on the virtuality - ordered parton in sherpa ,",
    "the reader is referred to a forthcoming publication @xcite . however ,",
    "if no further emissions are added through the parton shower , the partons stemming from the matrix element are left on their mass - shell and the kinematics remains unaltered . on the other hand , if the virtuality of one or more partons from the matrix element is increased through secondary emissions induced by the shower , the kinematics is modified .",
    "usually , the scales involved in the showering are much smaller than the scales prevalent in the matrix elements , which are of the order of or larger than @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , any manipulation of the kinematics tends to be mild .",
    "nevertheless in some cases changes in the kinematics may lead a posteriori to a considerable change of the nodal values from the @xmath4-algorithm .",
    "for instance , the production of @xmath0 bosons at the tevatron exhibits a strong asymmetry , which , to a considerable fraction , leads to configurations of the initial state , where the emission of jets or extra partons is concentrated on one incoming parton only . on rare occasions",
    ", such mass effects may alter the smallest nodal value in such a way that it becomes smaller than @xmath27 . in these cases , the phase - space separation underlying the full merging procedure is violated . within the sherpa  framework , these events are rejected .",
    "the corresponding rejection procedure is such that    * the next event is of the same process as the one being rejected , and * the sudakov weight is only applied to correct the kinematics rather than the rates .",
    "therefore , the jet rates determined by the prescription given in the previous section are not altered by the parton shower , and the phase - space separation through the @xmath4-algorithm is enforced .",
    "in this section the self - consistency of the results obtained with sherpa  is checked by analysing the dependence of different observables on the key parameters of the merging procedure , namely the separation scale @xmath27 and the highest multiplicity of included matrix elements @xmath72 .",
