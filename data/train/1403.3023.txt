    "one of very few exact results known for three dimensional homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is the kolmogorov @xmath0-law for inertial range of scales ; for @xmath7 flows with @xmath8 , it reads as : @xmath9 ^ 3\\right\\rangle =   -\\frac{12}{d(d+2)}\\ , \\varepsilon   r\\,,\\ ] ] where longitudinal velocity increments are considered .",
    "this relation connects velocity differences at scale @xmath10 with the presence of a non vanishing energy flux , @xmath11 . in the @xmath1 direct cascade ,",

    "the translation of eqn .",
    "[ fourthird ] to the lagrangian domain has been suggested long time back @xcite but it only relies on phenomenological bases .",
    "it connects eulerian fluctuations at separation @xmath10 , @xmath12 , with lagrangian temporal velocity difference over a time interval @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where space and time are connected through the local eddy turnover time : @xmath15 here due to the _ dimensional _ and phenomenological nature of the relation , all geometrical and vectorial properties are neglected .",
    "moreover , it is important to stress that the symbol @xmath16 in equation ( [ bridge ] ) is meant as _ scale - as _ in a pure _ statistical _ sense and not as a deterministic constraint holding point - by - point , as sometimes suggested @xcite .",
    "it results that the phenomenological equivalent of the exact law ( [ fourthird ] ) in the lagrangian domain reads : @xmath17 where the prefactor can not be exactly controlled .",
    "another important difference with respect to ( [ fourthird ] ) is that the sign of the right hand side is also fixed , implying that ( [ one ] ) can not be exact in principle because of the energy flux differently sign - defined in @xmath2 and in @xmath1 turbulence .",
    "this relation is intimately connected with the picture of the richardson cascade , built in terms of a superposition of eddies at different scales and with different characteristic times ( eddy turn over times ) .",
    "the idea is to imagine that lagrangian fluctuations , @xmath18 , at a given time - scale , @xmath13 , are dominated by those eulerian eddies , @xmath19 , which have a typical decorrelation time ( [ bridge ] ) of the order of the time lag , @xmath13 .",
    "indeed eddies at smaller scales are much less intense , i.e. if @xmath20 , then @xmath21 , while eddies at larger scales do not contribute to lagrangian fluctuations being almost frozen on the time lag @xmath13 .",
    "the _ bridge _ relation ( [ bridge ] ) must be considered the zero-_th _ order approximation connecting lagrangian and eulerian domains .",
    "it can not be exact and it can not be applied straightforwardly to all hydrodynamical systems , being strongly based on the hypotheses of locality of the energy transfer process and on the existence of a unique typical eddy turn over time at each scale . therefore it is not expected that it can straightforwardly explain lagrangian - eulerian correlations in conducting flows , as investigated in @xcite . + in considering the application of the bridge relation for lagrangian scaling in @xmath2 and @xmath1 hydrodynamical turbulence , the situation is not at all yet clear . on the one hand",
    ", it has been successfully used to predict the probability density function of accelerations and the relative scaling between lagrangian structure functions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when looking at direct scaling _ versus _ the time lag , inconclusive results have been obtained @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", different scaling behaviors have been proposed to overcome doubts raised due to the consistently poorer quality of the validation from both numerical and experimental tests @xcite , when compared to the eulerian counterpart . moreover , by means of a stochastic model , it has been argued that the observed reduced scale separation in the lagrangian frame is the main reason for the departure from kolmogorov scaling in data@xcite , and that the inertial sub - range linear scaling is eventually reached only at reynolds numbers beyond @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "+ note that acceleration probability and relative scaling of lagrangian structures functions are a probe of intermittent fluctuations over time lags @xmath13 , which can be assessed independently of the scaling of the second order moment @xmath23 .",
    "however , this deserves a particular interest since it is a key ingredient of lagrangian stochastic models for turbulent diffusion and dispersion @xcite .",
    "+ in this manuscript we specifically address the issue of poor inertial range scaling of @xmath23 , basing our analysis on currently available numerical data .",
    "our analysis points in the direction of an enhanced sensitivity to finite - re corrections in the lagrangian framework with respect to the eulerian one .",
    "we show that a simple modeling of finite reynolds number effect , affecting the small and the large scales , can be enough to interpret present data on the basis of the _ bridge _ relation ( [ bridge ] ) .",
    "this result confirms two things .",
    "first , that the dimensional _ kolmogorov - like _ argument of ( [ bridge ] ) , even if not supported by any exact theoretical statement , represents a very good first start to guess the statistical connections between eulerian and lagrangian statistics .",
    "second , that any possible _ new physics _ beyond the relation ( [ bridge ] ) is to be compared with more refined data at higher reynolds numbers .",
    "we remark that on the basis of the refined similarity approach @xcite , no intermittency correction of the second order structure function is expected .",
    "alternatively , in @xcite , a small modification of the linear scaling for the second order structure function has been proposed on the basis of the observed behavior of the acceleration spectrum .",
    "while further data are needed to definitely discriminate between anomalous scaling or finite reynolds number effects in the second order moment , we point out that the simple parameterization here proposed gives very good results without invoking any intermittent correction .",
    "finally , we stress that recently , by using hilbert - huang transform , further evidences for a linear scaling of second order lagrangian moment have been presented@xcite .",
    "we consider the second order moment of velocity increments measured along tracer trajectories in statistically stationary , isotropic and homogeneous ( hit ) @xmath1 dimensional turbulence : @xmath24 ^ 2 \\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is one component of the turbulent lagrangian velocity field .",
    "as mentioned , the kolmogorov scaling for the eulerian velocity increments once translated into the time domain via the _ bridge _ relation gives -for any velocity component- the linear prediction @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "observations @xcite suggest that in @xmath1 hit , @xmath28 $ ] : however , since even at the largest reynolds number achieved , both experimental and numerical data do not show a well developed scaling range in @xmath23 , the value of @xmath27 measured displays a weak yet detectable @xmath29 dependence @xcite .",
    "the point that we address here is to understand if this poor scaling reflects a real deviation from the linear scaling of lagrangian turbulence , or if it is just the result of finite reynolds numbers effects , coming from both ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) cutoffs . in the latter case",
    ", one could expect that future dns and experiments might be able to directly display scaling properties also in the lagrangian domain , including intermittency .",
    "in fact , at the moment current practice is analysing intermittency in the lagrangian domain only by using extended self - similarity approach @xcite , hence bypassing the need for well defined power - law behavior in the inertial range .    in order to understand the above issue , it is mandatory to have a control on the effects of viscous and integral scales on the _ supposed _ inertial range . due to the lack of control on the analytical side ,",
    "one possible way is to resort to phenomenological models @xcite , trying to reproduce the behavior of the velocity increments over the entire range of scale / frequency . in particular , according to studies over the last few decades @xcite , a parameterization proposed by batchelor became quite popular because of its simplicity and capability to include non trivial viscous - effects ( such as the intermittency of velocity gradients and acceleration ) @xcite , as well as the saturation effects observed at the large scales @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we test the possibility to get a suitable _ batchelor_-like parameterization able to capture the poor scaling behavior observed on the data .",
    "the anticipated success of this goal implies two facts .",
    "first , it shows that the absence of a genuine scaling observed at moderate reynolds numbers _ is not in contradiction _ with the possibility to have scaling at higher reynolds numbers .",
    "second , it gives a first hint on how far in reynolds number one needs to go before expecting an observable scaling behavior .",
    "of course the batchelor parameterization is not based on any analytical result and finds a justification only on its ability to reproduce data .",
    "other parameterizations are very much possible as well , and whether the batchelor one will agree or not with data at higher reynolds numbers is an open question for the future .    on a dimensional ground ,",
    "a parameterization for the time behavior of @xmath23 has to reproduce the three following regimes : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the kolmogorov time scale and @xmath32 is the large scale lagrangian eddy turnover time . if we assume a kolmogorov scaling in the temporal inertial range then @xmath33 , otherwise it can be kept as a free parameter ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : acc ] ) .",
    "we recall that by dimensional arguments we have @xmath34 . a functional form which interpolates between the above behaviors",

    "+ in figure  [ fig : fit ] , we show the results for the linearly compensated second order moment , when we take @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the effect of finite reynolds number induced by the large scale saturation are big , since a plateau develops only for very large reynolds numbers currently unreachable . in the inset",
    ", we zoom in the scaling region : starting for reynolds number @xmath39 , a scaling shows up .",
    "+ one can of course play with the parameterization in order to modify the transitions from viscous to inertial , and from inertial to integral ranges . in particular , by changing the functional form of the denominator in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : param ] ) and of the saturation factor , these transitions can be made sharper or smoother @xcite .",
    "+ we also note that in order to be consistent with an exponential decay for the velocity correlation function , one can possibly slightly refine the functional form of the saturation factor for large times ( see below ) .",
    "it is thus probable that the observed absence of a clear and well developed plateau in numerical and experimental data is just a finite reynolds number effect that , as we mentioned , are more pronounced in the lagrangian statistics than in the eulerian case ( dimensionally , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .    in fig .",

    "reasons for questioning their validity are : ( i ) the fact that such a relation , contrarily to the @xmath0-law , is not rigorously derived ; ( ii ) the fact that the scaling of the @xmath23 appears to be of poorer quality than its eulerian counterpart . + in the present manuscript",
    "we have addressed the issue of the consistency of present state - of - the - art numerical data with the linear dimensional scaling for the @xmath23 , both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 turbulence .",
    "more specifically we have tried to shed further light on the question whether or not the present data are consistent with the linear scaling for the @xmath23 plus finite reynolds number effects .",
    "eulerian and lagrangian data , both for @xmath1 and @xmath2 turbulence , appear to agree equally well with a batchelor - like parameterization , which takes into account dissipative and integral effects in a phenomenological way .",
    "+ this indicates that present @xmath1 and @xmath2 lagrangian data are _ not inconsistent with _ the relation ( [ bridge ] ) , once finite reynolds number effects are kept into account .",
    "furthermore , the use of the batchelor parameterization in @xmath1 turbulence allows to make prediction on the values of reynolds number for which a given window of direct scaling is expected to appear in the second order moment .",
    "alternatively , one might not follow the ockham s suggestion _ `` entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem '' _ @xcite and invoke a genuine -i.e",
    ". not reynolds number dependent- departure of @xmath23 from the linear scaling predicted by ( [ bridge ] ) .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was investigated the possibility that anomalous scaling develops already for @xmath23 and it was showed that also this option _ is not inconsistent with the _ data . + more investigation will be needed to understand whether the simple description ( [ bridge ] ) , plus reynolds number effects , is all we need -as far as scaling properties are concerned- , or if anomalous scaling as suggested in @xcite is correct .",
    "+ here , we also showed that ( [ bridge ] ) is able to predict the reynolds number dependency of the normalized root mean squared acceleration without the need to introduce any free parameter , if multifractal fluctuations in the eulerian statistics are considered .",
    "finally , let us comment that in @xmath1 turbulence , different scaling exponents for transverse and longitudinal spatial increments are observed @xcite , something not fully understood . along a lagrangian trajectory ,",
    "both longitudinal and transverse eulerian fluctuations are naturally mixed and entangled , introducing some uncertainties in the _ bridge _ relation as discussed here . in the @xmath2 inverse cascade regime ,",
    "eulerian longitudinal increments do not show any deviation from gaussianity , while the excess kurtosis measured on a mixed longitudinal and transverse eulerian increments is different from zero .",
    "the lagrangian equivalent of the latter eulerian measurement is also non gaussian and in agreement with the _ bridge _ relation . therefore , there are still many open points that must be further clarified . + we acknowledge useful discussions with e. bodenschatz , m. cencini , g. falkovich , s. musacchio , a. pumir , p.k .",

    "<S> the behavior of the second - order lagrangian structure functions on state - of - the - art numerical data both in two and three dimensions is studied . on the basis of a phenomenological connection between eulerian space - fluctuations and the lagrangian time - fluctuations , it is possible to rephrase the kolmogorov @xmath0-law into a relation predicting the linear ( in time ) scaling for the second order lagrangian structure function . </S>",
    "<S> when such a function is directly observed on current experimental or numerical data , it does not clearly display a scaling regime . </S>",
    "<S> a parameterization of the lagrangian structure functions based on batchelor model is introduced and tested on data for @xmath1 turbulence , and for @xmath2 turbulence in the inverse cascade regime . </S>",
    "<S> such parameterization supports the idea , previously suggested , that both eulerian and lagrangian data are consistent with a linear scaling plus finite - reynolds number effects affecting the small- and large - time scales . </S>",
    "<S> when large - time saturation effects are properly accounted for , compensated plots show a detectable plateau already at the available reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this parameterization allows us to make quantitative predictions on the reynolds number value for which lagrangian structure functions are expected to display a scaling region . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that this is also sufficient to predict the anomalous dependency of the normalized root mean squared acceleration as a function of the reynolds number , without fitting parameters . </S>"
