    "it is widely believed that the hadron colliders , such as tevatron and lhc , can directly probe possible new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) up to a few tev , while the international linear collider ( ilc ) can produce new physics signal events more easily resolved from backgrounds @xcite .",
    "an @xmath4 ilc can also be designed to operate as a @xmath1 collider .",
    "this is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial @xmath4 beams . in this case , the energy and luminosity of the photon beam would be the same order of magnitude of the parent electron beam and the set of final states are much richer than that in the @xmath4 mode . therefore , the @xmath1 collider will provide us a good chance to pursuit new physics particles .    as a possible solution to avoid the shortcomings of the triviality and unnaturalness arising from the elementary higgs field ,",
    "the technicolor theory was proposed and so far remains a popular candidate for new physics beyond sm @xcite . among the various tc models ,",
    "the topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model is a more realistic one @xcite , which is consistent with the current experiment . in the tc2 model ,",
    "the topcolor interaction makes small contribution to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and gives rise to the main part of the top quark mass @xmath5 with a model dependant parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one of the most general predictions of the tc2 model is the existence of three pseudo - goldstone bosons , so called top - pions ( @xmath7 ) and an isospin singlet boson called top - higgs ( @xmath8 ) , which masses are in the range of hundreds of gev .",
    "thus , studying the possible signatures of these typical particles in the high energy experiments would provide crucial information for ewsb and fermion flavor physics .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of these new particles can be regarded as direct evidence to test the tc2 model .",
    "the tc2 model is expected to give new significant signatures in future high energy colliders and studied in references @xcite , due to the new particles which are predicted by this model .",
    "because the sm predicts the existence of one neutral higgs boson , so any observation of charged higgs particles will mean the signal of a new physics .",
    "therefore , probing of charged top - pions is more important to test the tc2 model . at the high - energy @xmath4 linear colliders ,",
    "the main signal charged top - pion production processes are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , which have been systematically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so far , the reaction @xmath12 have been studied in the sm @xcite , and the similar processes for the neutral or charged scalar have also been investigated via @xmath4 or @xmath1 model in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the two - higgss doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite , the littlest higgs ( lh ) model @xcite , as well as the left - right twin higgs ( lrth ) model @xcite . in the tc2 model",
    "the pair production of the charged scalar @xmath13 has also been probed in ref .",
    "complementing ref .",
    "@xcite , in this paper we will study the production of the pair charged top - pions via process @xmath14 at @xmath1 colliders within the tc2 model .",
    "the remainder parts of this paper are organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we shall present the calculations of the production cross section of the process @xmath15 .",
    "numerical results on the cross section and concluding remarks will appear in sec .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the process @xmath15 are given in fig . 1 . and",
    "the relevant feynman rules for the couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the tc2 model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with the relevant couplings ,",
    "the invariant production amplitudes of the process @xmath18 can be written as follows :    @xmath19    here , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the polarization vector of the photon , @xmath22 denotes the mass of the charged top pions .    with the above amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we can directly obtain the production cross section @xmath25 for the subprocess @xmath15 and the total cross sections at the @xmath4 linear collider can be obtained by folding @xmath25 with the photon distribution function @xmath26 which is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the squared c. m. of @xmath4 collision , @xmath30 for the initial unpolarized electrons and laser photon beams , the energy spectrum of the backscattered photon is given by @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 the definitions of parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be found in @xcite . in our numerical calculation , we choose @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "to get the numerical results of the cross section , we should also fix the parameter in the sm as @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the top - pions mass @xmath40 is also involved in the production amplitudes .",
    "the tc2 model loosely predicts top - pions to lie in the mass range of about @xmath41 gev .",
    "top - pions this light are disfavored by the data for @xmath42 @xcite , but the contribution of new etc gauge bosons can help to relax the constraint on the top - pions mass @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take @xmath40 as a free parameter and expand the mass range to @xmath43 gev to estimate the total cross section of @xmath44 associated production at the ilc .     in the tc2 model as a functions of @xmath40.,width=288,height=288 ]    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the cross section @xmath45 of the process @xmath15 as a function of the mass parameter @xmath40 with the three values of the center of mass energy .",
    "the plot shows that the cross section @xmath45 decreases with @xmath40 increasing , this is because the phase space is depressed strongly by large @xmath40 . in general , the production rate is at the level of @xmath46 fb in a large part of the allowed parameter space . for @xmath47 gev , @xmath48 gev , and for @xmath49 ,",
    "the value of @xmath45 is in the range of @xmath50 fb and @xmath51 fb , respectively .",
    "according to the ilc reference design report @xcite , the ilc is determined to run with @xmath52 gev ( upgradeable to @xmath53 gev ) and the total luminosity required is @xmath54 with the first four - year operation and @xmath55 during the first phase of operation with @xmath52 gev .",
    "if we assume the intergrated luminosity @xmath56 , there will be up to several hundreds of @xmath44 events to be generated per year at the ilc experiments .",
    "in the tc2 model as a functions of @xmath57.,width=288,height=288 ]    to see the effect of the c.m .",
    "energy on the production cross section , in fig.3 we plot the cross section @xmath45 as the function of @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev , respectively . due to",
    "the contributions to the cross section come mainly from the t - channel and u - channel , thus the large @xmath57 can enhance the cross section significantly and the values of the cross section can reach 180 fb maximally in the reasonable parameter space .",
    "considering the subsequent main decay of @xmath60 @xcite and @xmath61 , the possible signal for @xmath44 production at the ilc is four jets @xmath62 + two leptons + missing energy @xmath63 .",
    "the production rate of the @xmath64 final state can be easily estimated @xmath65 $ ] . using the value of the branching ratio @xmath66 @xcite which is affected by the model - dependent parameter @xmath67 , in fig .",
    "4 , we show the numerical results for the production rate of the @xmath64 . from fig . 4",
    ", one can see that the production rate can reach 50 fb with reasonable values of the free parameters of the tc2 model.the cross section of the irreducible @xmath64 background for @xmath57= 800 gev has been estimated in reference @xcite and found to be 5.5 fb .",
    "thus , it may be possible to extract the signals from the backgrounds in the reasonable parameter space of the tc2 model by considering kinematic distribution of the signal .",
    "certainly , detailed confirmation of the observability of the signals generated by the process @xmath15 would depend on monte carlo simulations of the signals and backgrounds , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finial state of the process @xmath15 as a function of the parameter @xmath40 for @xmath57 = 1000 gev with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively.,width=288,height=288 ]    for the light charged top - pions , the branching ratio of @xmath71 can be comparative to that of @xmath72 . in this case , @xmath73 is also an important mode which induces the signals @xmath74 .",
    "although @xmath71 is a flavor - changing decay mode , @xmath74 production is not the flavor - changing process .",
    "therefore , the sm background can not be ignored .",
    "the major irreducible background should come from @xmath75 .",
    "the mistagging of b - quark and s - quark will make the @xmath76 become important which significantly enhances the background .",
    "so , the efficient b - tagging and mass reconstruction of the charged top - pion are very necessary to reduce the background .    in summary , in the tc2 model",
    "we evaluate the signal pair production of charged top - pions via process @xmath77 at the ilc . it is found that tc2 model can make a significant contribution to this processes . for the process @xmath15",
    ", can reach @xmath2 fb in optimal case . considering the main decay mode of top - pions",
    ", we find that with such cross section , it is possible to detect the signal of the charged top - pions experimentally in the most of the parameter space at the future linear linear colliders operating in @xmath1 model at the tev energy scale . even if we can not observe the signals in future ilc experiments , at least , we can obtain the bounds on the free parameters of the tc2 model .",
