    "solar - like oscillations of giant stars were firstly confirmed in a few stars @xcite .",
    "and then the presence of radial and non - radial solar - like oscillations in a large sample of red giants was presented by @xcite .",
    "although only a very limited number of modes ( @xmath8 3 ) are likely to be observed in solar - like oscillations due to geometrical cancellation effects , the low - degree p - modes of the oscillations can penetrate deep into the interior of stars @xcite , and each low - degree p - mode carries unique information about the stellar interior .",
    "thus , asteroseismology has the capability to probe the interior of stars and to determine stellar fundamental parameters @xcite .",
    "however , for most of red giants , only the mean large - frequency separation ( ) and the frequency of maximum seismic amplitude ( ) have been obtained so far .",
    "the oscillation frequencies and of a large sample of red giants were firstly extracted by @xcite from the data observed by the first _ convection rotation and planetary transits ( corot ) _",

    "corot _ in the opposite direction of lrc01 ( lra01 ) , @xcite found similar results , except for the locations of the dominant peaks and the values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath6 . by making use of the data observed by",
    "mission @xcite , @xcite and @xcite also obtained very similar results .",
    "moreover , the values of and of red giants of clusters ngc 6811 , ngc 6819 , and ngc 6791 have also been extracted by @xcite and @xcite . for an ensemble of stars ,",
    "the and can be applied to investigate many interesting questions about the galaxy or stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "these studies advanced our understanding of the theory of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "furthermore , it has been identified that the non - uniform distributions of and of red giants result from red - clump [ core - helium - burning(cheb ) ] stars @xcite .",
    "the dominant peak in the distributions of and , which is located around 30 and 4 for and , respectively , is mainly composed of the stars that are close to the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) @xcite . stars with @xmath11 40 are mainly red - clump stars with mass larger than 2.0 @xcite . these stars could be attributed to the secondary red clump ( src ) predicted by @xcite @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the src stars could become a hump in the distribution roughly between 70 and 100 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] or the figure 2 in @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite also showed that the distributions of and observed by _",
    "corot _ have a complex structure .",
    "the src has been identified in the colour - magnitude diagrams of some intermediate - age star clusters , such as ngc 419 in the small magellanic cloud @xcite and ngc 1751 in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the src in clusters is still an open question @xcite , the src should be present in all galactic fields containing stars with an age of about 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "the src is believed to be made of stars whose mass is slightly more massive than the critical mass ( ) that is the maximum mass allowing helium flash to occur @xcite .",
    "stellar models with @xmath12 can be generally evolved from zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) without interruption . however , the models with @xmath5 are hardly computed through the violent helium flash .",
    "thus , the stars with @xmath12 should be more suitable to study solar - like oscillations of cheb stars and the effects of convective - core overshooting and other physical processes on the oscillations in details than the stars with @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the astroseismic detection and study on src stars may provide additional constraints on the star - formation history in the galaxy and allow us to determine the value of .        in this paper",

    "we show our stellar models and population - synthesis method in section 2 .",
    "we present the results in section 3 and discuss and summarize them in section 4 .",

    "was calibrated against the sun*. the convective - core overshooting is treated as the prescription of @xcite . the value of 0.12 for the overshooting parameter @xmath4 is chosen to match the properties of @xmath13 aurigae binaries which span a mass range of 2.5 to 7.0 @xcite .",
    "the initial hydrogen and helium abundances are assumed to be functions of the metallicity as follows : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the efficiency of @xcite mass - loss rate is set to 0.4 for all models .",
    "the opacity table for the metallicity is compiled by @xcite from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , element diffusion for helium and metals is not taken into account .",
    "all models with @xmath12 were evolved from zams to agb stage without interruption . for the low - mass stars ( @xmath5 )",
    "we were unable to compute through the he - flash .",
    "instead , we constructed zahb models using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "these zahb models were evolved up to the agb stage .",
    "it should be noticed that some errors could be introduced in the post he - flash evolution of these constructed zahb models @xcite .",
    "in addition , for a star given mass , radius and effective temperature , the theoretical and were calculated by using scaling equations @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 here , the value of 134.6 for @xmath18 is obtained from the gong data @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of these estimates is good to within 5% @xcite .      in order to obtain the distributions of and of src stars , we calculated single - star stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "stellar samples are generated by the monte carlo simulation .",
