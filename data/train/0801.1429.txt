    "accurate determination of total mass of galaxy clusters is important to understand properties and evolution of these systems , as well as for many cosmological applications .",
    "gravitational lensing , through multiple image systems ( strong lensing ) as well as from distortions of background sources ( weak lensing ) , provides a reliable method to determine the cluster mass , which is independent of the equilibrium properties of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the lensing mass determination can be compared to estimates based on measured x - ray surface brightness and temperature , which is instead based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite or to dynamical estimates , which rely on the assumption of virialized systems . combining optical",
    ", x - ray and radio observations of galaxy clusters is a major tool to investigate their intrinsic properties .",
    "in particular , the comparison of lensing and x - ray studies can give fundamental insights on the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters ( see for example @xcite ) , on the validity of the equilibrium hypothesis and on their 3-dimensional structure @xcite .",
    "rx j1347.5 - 1145 ( @xmath3 ) is one of the most x - ray luminous and massive galaxy cluster known .",
    "this cluster has been the subject of numerous x - ray @xcite , optical ( sahu et al.1998 ) and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sze ) effect studies @xcite .",
    "formerly believed to be a well relaxed cluster , with a good agreement between weak - lensing @xcite , strong lensing @xcite and x - ray mass estimates @xcite , more recent investigations revealed a more complex dynamical structure .",
    "in particular , a region of enhanced emission in the south - eastern quadrant was first detected by sze effect observations @xcite and later confirmed by x - ray observations that also measured an hotter temperature for the excess component @xcite .",
    "this feature has been interpreted as an indication of a recent merger event @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a spectroscopic survey on the cluster members found a velocity dispersion of @xmath4 , which is significantly smaller than that derived from weak lensing , @xmath5 ( fisher & tyson 1997 ) , strong lensing , roughly 1300 @xmath6 and x - ray analyses @xmath7 ( * ? ? ? * see their table  4 ) .",

    "we use a flat model of universe with a cosmological constant with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this implies a linear scale of @xmath10 at the cluster redshift .",
    "the lensing analysis was based on archival vlt data , performed using the same dataset of brada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and more recent hst data .",
    "the vlt data were obtained with fors1 in high resolution mode ( pixel scale 0.09 , total field of view @xmath11 ) , using ubvri bessel filters .",
    "the seeing in the @xmath12-filter is of @xmath13 .",
    "details on the data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "we generated object catalogs for each band , using sextractor v2.4.4 to measure photometric and geometrical parameters .",
    "so far , more than five arc candidates for this cluster have been reported in the literature ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first two ( a1 and a4 ) were discovered by schindler et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; later , hst stis images revealed three additional ones , i.e. a2 , a3 , a5 @xcite .",
    "recently , brada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported the discover of several new arc candidates ( ac , b1 b2 , c , d1 , d2 , d3 , d4 , e ) using vlt data .",
    "arc a1 ( @xmath14 ) is the only one with measured spectroscopic redshift ( allen et al .",
    "2002 ) . despite a3 could appear as a likely counter arc , this identification is still pretty uncertain . for the rest of the arcs",
    "only photometric redshift estimates are available so far @xcite .",
    "thus , based on the existing literature we decided to start to use the most likely multiple - image system , e.g. the a4-a5 arcs , to model the cluster mass distribution .",
    "we then searched for additional images .",
    "following brada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we compared photometric properties and used flux measurements in ubvri to distinguish different arc families .",
    "we inspected the galaxies having i - band magnitude up to three magnitudes fainter than the bcg and with a distance to the bcg smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "we confirm that the most plausible counter arc candidate is ac , giving a system of three images a4 , a5 and ac ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) which have consistent multi - band colors ( using 5 \" aperture magnitudes ) and surface brightness within the errors .",
    "such a system is likely due to a source redshift at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that , while we can not exclude that there are additional multiple - image systems , our analysis indicates that there are no additional lensed images belonging to the a4-a5 system within the inspected region and above our detection limit .",
    "new observations from hst , in the f475 , f814 and f850 bands , became recently available ( proposal i d .",
    "we analysed the new data to check whether they confirmed out findings .",
    "the three images , obtained with the acs camera , are not significantly deeper than the vlt data , but the higher spatial resolution ( 0.05 \" fwhm ) allows to better disentangle nearby sources .",
    "the analysis confirms that a4 , a5 and ac have consistent colors . in particular ac",
    "could now be resolved in a tangential arc and an overlapping source , see fig .",
    "[ fig1bis ] .",
    "we find that while the arc is fully compatible with the other images , the overlapping source is not , thus strengthening the results based on vlt data .",
    "we consider two density profiles to model the mass components : the first one for the cluster - sized halos and the second one for the galaxy - sized objects .",
    "we model the main mass ( dark matter plus baryonic intra - cluster medium ) components as softened power law ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "the projected surface mass density at the projected position @xmath17 in the plane of the sky is as usual expressed in terms of the convergence @xmath18 , i.e the ratio of the local surface mass density of the lens @xmath19 to the critical surface mass density @xmath20 , being @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the source , lens and the lens - source angular diameter distances , respectively . for a general softened power law ellipsoidal model , @xmath24 where @xmath25 gives the mass normalisation , @xmath26 is the projected axis ratio , @xmath27 is the slope index , @xmath28 is a core radius and @xmath29 is an elliptical coordinate .",
    "we will adopt , for the main dark components , the non singular isothermal ellipsoid ( nsie ) which has @xmath30 fixed to 1 .",
    "we model the galaxy - sized ( dark matter plus stellar content ) halos as pseudo - jaffe models @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - jaffe model is obtained by combining two softened isothermal ellipsoids in such a way that the projected density falls as @xmath31 outside the cut - off radius @xmath32 .",
    "we performed a @xmath33 fit taking care of both the contribution from the image positions , @xmath34 , and the arc shapes and orientations , @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 .",
    "we evaluated them in the _ image plane _ @xcite using the gravlens code @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 accounts for the agreement between the observed positions of the arc centroids and their predicted values .",
    "computing the @xmath37 in the image plane is the most reliable technique when dealing with just one multiple image system .",
    "in fact , the alternative procedure of estimating @xmath33 in the _ source plane _",
    "@xcite , despite of being computationally faster , does not take into account how many images make up the observed system , and might prefer in a flawed way mass models that yield a good fit adding fictitious images .",
    "we took into account the shape and orientation of the observed arcs sampling each curve in a number of points @xcite .",
    "a useful @xmath35 takes into account the distances between the fitted points of the counter - images of a test curve and the data points sampling the other reference curve .",
    "such an approach is best suited to exploit the a4-a5-ac system , where the arcs are elongated and well defined .",
    "our strong lensing statistical analysis was then implemented considering the system a4-a5-ac as a multiple image system .",
    "we considered both the centroid position and shape and orientation of the arcs as input data .",
    "we chose a4 , the longest and better defined arc , as test curve , leaving the others as reference curves .",
    "the positions of the sampling points are showed in fig .",

    "the number of parameters , @xmath45 , and the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath46 , for the different models are reported in tab .",
    "[ tablechi ] . in our fitting analysis",
    ", we assume a positional uncertainty of 0.01.      as a first step , we considered the simplest tentative model , i.e a single main mass component centred in the neighbourhood of the bcg .",
    "although we performed the whole investigation in the image plane , we first considered also the @xmath47 minimisation in the source plane .",
    "this allows @xmath48 to further check if other additional images of the chosen lens system are formed and @xmath49 to allow an easy comparison with previous works .",
    "a model with a single dark matter component provides a good fit only if two further images are present in the a4-a5-ac system .",
    "they appear when we check the @xmath47 fitting result on the image plane .",
    "these two additional images should be lensed in the field of view of the vlt and hst observation , @xmath50 sw of the bcg , with amplification factors of the same order of the other three images and should then be easily detected , if present .",
    "this model has been then discarded .",
    "this first model is essentially the same as the one used in brada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as a first step in their fitting procedure .",
    "we then performed the @xmath33 minimisation in the image plane letting all the dark component parameters vary ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "a single mass component yields a very poor fit with a very high @xmath44 .",
    "the mass component is located 0.@xmath52 east of the bcg . in tab .",
    "[ tablechi ] you can see the performance and the properties of this model , together with the other models discussed in the following .    a single dark matter component model is therefore not appropriate to describe the matter content in rx  j1347.5 - 1145 , hence revealing a possible more complex configuration .",
    "even if the details of the results in the following subsections strongly relies on the position of the counter - arc ac , the information contained in the shapes and orientations of a4 and a5 alone indicates a somewhat irregular mass distribution .",
    "we tried to improve the fit by adding a second main mass component .",
    "we first considered the model with the two main matter components being fixed at the positions of the two brightest galaxies ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this model is similar to the one proposed by @xcite , where the mass components were constrained by requiring that the overall potential was able to produce the northern arc 1 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , as @xcite themselves remarked , their best model could not explain a4 and a5 as images of the same source , as instead suggested by later photometric observations .    when we consider the a4-a5-ac system as input data , the image positions are poorly reproduced and we get a radial a5 with an extremely high @xmath35 .",
    "even if we move the position of the second mass component from the second brightest cluster galaxy ( scg ) towards the peak of the south - eastern x - ray substructure , the fit is still very poor .",
    "we then made an additional step further , and let the position of the second dark matter halo free to vary , while leaving the main one fixed on the bcg ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "a first acceptable result is that a second component at @xmath55 east of the bcg can improve the fit substantially .",
    "the main improvement obtained with this model is that the arc 5 is now tangential , even if too much elongated and shifted towards north with respect to what observed . adding a second component clearly improves our fit , strongly suggesting a bimodal structure for the cluster .",
    "we further explored the bimodal structure of the cluster by relaxing also the position of the first main mass component ( @xmath56 ) , see fig .",
    "the fit obtained is pretty good , @xmath57 .",
    "the two dark matter components have comparable masses and their centres do not coincide with either the bcg or scg ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the first component is located north - west of the bcg , the second one south - east ( but far away from the secondary x - ray peak ) .      to test the reliability of the bimodal scenario and give an insight on some possible degeneracies",
    ", we explored some alternatives accounting for other physical effects .",
    "we then explored the effect of adding some further components , by considering a model with three main components , keeping the first two dark matter components fixed and adding a third free component , @xmath58 .",
    "we fixed the first component in the bcg ( coincident with the first x - ray peak ) and the second one in the second x - ray peak leaving the third one free to vary .",
    "even if the image positions are well reproduced , this model does not improve substantially the fit to the observations with respect to the model with two components .",
    "in fact , the mass clump centred on the x - ray peak is very small compared to the others and the global result is very similar to that with one component fixed and the second one free to vary .",
    "for all models , when leaving only one component free to vary , while fixing the other / s one / s , the free component is always located in the eastern part of the system , showing a mass of the same order of the other main component , while the second frozen component , located either in the scg or in the second x - ray peak , tends to be much smaller .

    "the reliability of this result appeared by considering different alternative scenarios , which are summarised in table [ tablechi ] .",

    "[ tablechi ] , we can see that the one component model is highly disfavoured , while adding a second mass component improves the fit , since the bic value substantially drops down , suggesting a bimodal structure for the cluster .",
    "when we let one component position vary , the bic value becomes even smaller and a substantial improvement is obtained when you let both component positions be free .",
    "adding the 10 galaxies does not improve considerably the fit , but it helps to better refine the features of the cluster model . in other words , a bimodal model is naturally favoured by our analysis , which definitely rules out the case with just one component .    the consideration of different lens configurations allowed also an insight into model degeneracies .",
    "as can be inferred by the previous analysis , the main degeneracy is connected to the positions of the two cluster - sized halos making up the binary lens .",
    "the fit does not change in a dramatic way if the two centres are translated keeping the separation fixed at @xmath90 .",
    "our result on the model configuration does not depend on the estimated source redshift .",
    "in fact , a variation of @xmath91 implies a rescaling of the critical density , but does not affect the positions and the relative mass ratios of the components of the cluster .",

    "on one hand , neglecting the x - ray south - east sub - clump implies that we are not considering an additional contribution to the total mass , which is consequently underestimated . on the other hand",
    ", the temperature in a merging system might be inflated with respect to the temperature of a relaxed cluster , which implies an over - estimate of the mass .    whereas x - ray and lensing estimates are in good agreement ,",
    "the dynamical mass estimate is considerably smaller @xcite .",
    "cohen & kneib ( 2002 ) suggested a merger scenario to solve this puzzle .",
    "until the merger is complete and galaxy orbits have virialized to the new total mass , the dynamical mass estimate would be biased toward the mass of the larger clump . then",
    ", a major merger between two clumps of comparable mass could reconcile the discrepant observations .",
    "the bimodal mass distribution inferred in our analysis is in agreement with this merging scenario .",
    "moreover the merger is possibly happening in the plane of the sky , since the redshift distribution of the cluster members does not show any feature along the line of sight .",
    "the merger scenario is also supported by the x - ray and sze observations of the intra - cluster medium .",
    "both the gas sub - clump and the hot front in the se quadrant are indications of a merger process .",
    "the overall agreement between the x - ray and lensing mass estimates might suggest that the emitting gas has had time to virialize .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium is also supported by the fact that the overall mass , temperature and luminosity of rx j1347 + 1145 relate as expected by a typical for massive cluster @xcite .",
    "a major merger scenario was also considered in kitayama et al.(2004 ) , which discussed as an head - on collision of two @xmath136 clusters with relative velocity of @xmath137 would result in a bounce - shock with @xmath138 , as detected in the se quadrant .",
    "we have analysed both the lensing and x - ray properties of rx  j1347.5 - 11.45 , one of the most luminous and massive x - ray cluster known . based on the analysis of an arc family , photometrically selected ,",
    "we have estimated the total cluster mass distribution , within a radius of @xmath139 from the cluster centre .",
    "we performed a @xmath33 analysis in the lens plane and scrupulously modelled the arc configuration . a model with two smooth dark matter components of similar mass",
    "accurately reproduces the observations and yields a mass estimate in agreement with previous strong and weak lensing and x - ray studies .",
    "our strong lensing analysis suggests a major merger between two sub - clumps of similar mass located within the central @xmath140 .",
    "x - ray observations further strengthen our view of a complex structure of the inner regions , revealing a hot front in the south - eastern area , most probably a remnant of the occurred merger .",
    "this merging framework , which arises naturally from our strong lensing model , can also reconcile the observed discrepancy between dynamical mass estimates and x - ray , lensing and sze ones , which instead give consistent results .",
    "agreement between x - ray and lensing mass estimates further indicates that the gas might have had time to virialize .",
    "spectroscopic measurements additionally suggest that the merger is taking place in the plane of the sky .",
    "whereas the presence of a merger is confirmed on several grounds , its properties are though still unclear .",
    "the detailed features of our model are strictly related to the selection of the members of the multiple image system , in particular to the inclusion of the arc ac . despite all candidates should be confirmed spectroscopically , a photometric analysis suggests that a4 and a5 almost undoubtedly belong to the same system .",
    "remarkably , based on the shapes and orientations of a4 and a5 alone , without any constraint on ac , we can exclude the presence of a single mass component .",
    "a spectroscopic confirmation of further arc candidates is the required step to confirm and accurately define the merging scenario and to provide a final , more accurate description of the dynamical state of rx j1347.5 - 1145 .",
