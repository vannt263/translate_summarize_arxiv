    "the ionizing radiation emitted by a luminous quasar can , like a flashlight , illuminate hydrogen in its vicinity , teaching us about the physical properties of gas in its surroundings .",
    "this is because photoionized hydrogen ultimately produces ly@xmath11 recombination photons , which are likely to escape the system .",
    "whether this ` fluorescent ' emission arises from the highly ionized ly@xmath11 forest clouds in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) which are optically thin to ionizing photons , from the optically thick lyman limit systems ( llss ) and damped lyman-@xmath11 systems ( dlas ) detected as the strongest absorption lines in quasar spectra , or from the interstellar or circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) of the quasar host itself , the underlying principle is nevertheless the same  a fraction of the energy in the quasars uv continuum is ` focused ' into line radiation and re - emitted back into space , informing us about the physical conditions of the emitting gas .",
    "the idea of searching for fluorescent @xmath0  emission from the intergalactic medium is not new .",
    "@xcite first proposed that fluorescent emission might be detectable from the optically thin @xmath12 , ly@xmath11 forest clouds , which emit recombination photons because they are illuminated by the ambient extragalactic uv background . @xcite made the crucial point that emission from the @xmath13 lsss should be much brighter , because these clouds , being optically thick to lyman continuum photons , absorb all the ionizing radiation incident upon them .",
    "some @xmath14 of these ionizing photons result in @xmath0  recombinations , and are ` mirrored ' back as ly@xmath11 photons .",
    "thus at the very faintest flux levels , uv background radiation should power a ubiquitous fluorescence signal , whereby all of the optically thick gas in the cosmic web would ` glow ' in the @xmath0  line @xcite .",
    "observationally , a number of increasingly sensitive searches for fluorescent radiation powered by the ambient uv background have been performed @xcite , the deepest being the @xmath15 hour integration by @xcite using the very large telescope ( vlt ) . notwithstanding these efforts ,",
    "the fluorescence signal has yet to be detected , and given independent estimates for the uv background intensity @xcite , the expected surface brightness @xmath16 is probably out of reach of current instrumentation .",
    "but in the regions proximate to a quasar the ionizing flux and resulting fluorescent surface brightness can be significantly enhanced , provided the quasar does not photoevaporate the nearby optically thick clouds .",
    "fluorescence in the vicinity of a quasar has been searched for by a number of authors @xcite yielding either null or questionable detections .",
    "perhaps most contentious is @xcite , who purport to detect fluorescent emission from a dla serendipitously detected in a background quasar spectrum which is @xmath17 away from a luminous foreground quasar at @xmath18 .",
    "owing to the proximity of the foreground quasar , the ionizing flux should be enhanced by a factor of @xmath19 over the uvb . however , the large continuum luminosity of this source and its implied relatively modest rest - frame @xmath0  equivalent width ( ew ) of 75  suggest that it may simply be @xmath0  emission from the galaxy counterpart to the dla , rather than quasar powered fluorescence .",
    "most recently , @xcite performed a deep survey for @xmath0  emission around a very bright @xmath20 quasar . in their narrow - band imaging , they report the detection of @xmath21 sources in their @xmath22 field of view , corresponding to a @xmath23 comoving mpc@xmath24 volume .",
    "they further note that a significant subset ( @xmath25 ) exhibit @xmath0  ews far in excess of the maximum predicted value from star - forming regions ( i.e.  @xmath26 ) .",
    "these sources are the most convincing candidates to date for fluorescing gas in the extended environment ( several mpc separation ) of , and powered by , a quasar .",
    "however it still remains unclear whether these candidate fluorescent emitters are counterparts to typical optically thick absorbers ( llss and dlas ) , and why more bright fluorescent emitters were not detected very close ( @xmath27 proper ) to the quasar .",
    "we will address both of these questions in this paper .",
    "besides illuminating nearby clouds in the igm , a quasar may irradiate gas in its own host galaxy or circumgalactic halo .",
    "@xcite suggested that cold cgm gas in the quasar host illuminated by the quasar could be detectable as an extended `` fuzz '' of fluorescent ly@xmath11 emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of groups have reported the detection of extended @xmath0  emission in the vicinity of @xmath28 quasars @xcite .",
    "these efforts , some targeted and some serendipitous , reveal a diversity both in emission level , detection frequency , and physical extent , but detailed quantitative interpretation is hampered by differing methodologies ( deep longslit spectroscopy versus narrow - band imaging ) , sample inhomogeneities ( radio - loud versus radio - quiet ) , a broad range of redshifts ( significant given @xmath29 surface brightness dimming and strong evolution in the quasar population ) , and ambiguities in detection criteria and definitions of the depth of the observations .",
    "nevertheless , the emerging picture is that roughly half of quasars from @xmath30 exhibit extended emission on scales of @xmath31 down to observed frame surface brightness levels of @xmath32 .",
    "there is suggestive evidence that radio - loud quasars have brighter emission and a higher detection frequency @xcite , although high detection frequencies have also been reported in samples which are mostly radio - quiet @xcite .",
    "finally , this @xmath0  emission may be powered by the same mechanism powering the extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) detected around low redshift @xmath6 type - i ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and type - ii @xcite quasars , traced by [ ] and balmer lines .",
    "the brightest cases of @xmath0  nebulosities around quasars have an average surface brightness @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) over a diameter of @xmath3 , corresponding to a total ly@xmath11 luminosity of @xmath35 .",
    "these nebulae bear a striking resemblance to the extended @xmath0  emission typically observed around high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrg ; e.g. * ? ?",

    "the primary difference between the nebulae around quasars versus those around hzrgs or @xmath0  blobs , is that a strong source of ionizing photons ( e.g. the quasar ) is directly identified , but not for the hzrgs or blobs .",
    "obscuration and orientation effects , as are often invoked in unified models of agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could be responsible for this difference .",
    "indeed , there is ample evidence for obscured agn in hzrgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and evidence for obscured agn have been uncovered in several of the labs @xcite , although there are several notable exceptions @xcite .",
    "although photoionization by an agn is perhaps the most plausible mechanism powering extended @xmath0  nebulae , particularly when the quasar is directly observed , a litany of other mechanisms have also been put forward .",
    "other sources of ionizing photons , such as fast radiative shocks powered by radio - jets @xcite or starburst driven superwinds @xcite have been discussed .",
    "it also been suggested that x - rays produced via inverse compton scattering of cmb photons ( and/or local far - ir photons ) by relativistic electrons in radio jets @xcite , could be the source of ionization .",
    "the possibility that extended @xmath0  emission is powered by star - formation , either via stellar ionizing photons escaping from galaxies @xcite , spatially extended star - formation @xcite , or by pure scattering of @xmath0  photons @xcite , has also been considered .",
    "in addition to photoionization and scattering , a large body of theoretical work has suggested that @xmath0  emission nebulae could result from @xmath0  cooling radiation powered by gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "this scenario is particularly fashionable in light of a plethora of work on the so - called ` cold mode ' of cosmological accretion @xcite , whereby a significant fraction of the gas accreting onto galaxies from the igm remains cold @xmath36 , and funnels in along large - scale filaments . in the absence of significant metal - enrichment ,",
    "collisionally excited ly@xmath11 is the primary coolant of @xmath37 gas ; hence the accreting gas could steadily radiate gravitational potential energy in the @xmath0  line as it falls into the halo .",
    "while many studies have suggested that gravitational cooling radiation could power the labs @xcite , the predictions of these simulations are uncertain by orders of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the emissivity of collisionally excited @xmath0  is exponentially sensitive to gas temperature .",
    "accurate prediction of the temperature requires solving a coupled radiative transfer and hydrodynamics problem which is not currently computational feasible ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    thus despite significant observational and theoretical efforts ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath0  nebulae in quasars , hzrgs , and labs is rather confusing , and the physical process powering extended @xmath0  emission remains an important unsolved problem .",
    "questions also remain about @xmath0  emission outside of quasar halos , on the larger scales relevant to quasar powered igm fluorescence .    in this fourth paper of the ` quasars probing quasars ' series",
    ", we introduce a novel technique to tackle the important problem of emission from the cgm .",
    "we search for this emission from close projected quasar pairs , which have small angular separation on the sky but large line - of - sight separations such that the two quasars are physically unassociated . in these unique sightlines , absorption in the background ( ` b / g ' ) quasar encodes information about the distribution of circumgalactic and intergalactic gas in the vicinity of the foreground ( ` f / g ' ) quasar .",
    "this technique thus allows us to analyze the absorption - line and emission - line properties of gas around quasars _",
    "simultaneously_. we perform a systematic , spectroscopic survey for extended @xmath0  emission in the vicinity ( @xmath38kpc ) of @xmath39 quasars , to typical @xmath1 surface - brightness limits of @xmath40 .",
    "the data are drawn from our survey of projected quasar pairs @xcite , and we restrict our analysis to 29 projected pair systems for which the spectrum of the b / g quasar shows evidence for an lls coincident with the redshift of the f / g quasar . if the f / g quasar is illuminating this optically thick gas , this is a prime candidate for bright @xmath0  fluorescence and the the b / g quasar pinpoints the expected location of the emission . independently ,",
    "our observations provide a sensitive search for any extended @xmath0  emission in the environment of @xmath39 quasars , such as might be powered by @xmath0  cooling radiation or any of the other physical mechanism just discussed .",
    "our b / g quasar absorption - line measurements statistically map out the covering factor of optically thick absorption in the quasar cgm @xcite , and detailed absorption - line modeling places constraints on the physical properties of this gas @xcite .",

    "a typical quasar at @xmath46 with an sdss magnitude of @xmath51 , has specific luminosity at the lyman edge of @xmath52 ( ergs@xmath53hz@xmath53 ) , and at a distance of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 projected on the sky ) the flux of ionizing photons would be a factor @xmath56 times higher than the ambient extragalactic uv background .",
    "finally , we use the terms optically thick absorbers and llss interchangeably , both referring to quasar absorption line systems with @xmath57 , making them optically thick at the lyman limit ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this section provides analytical estimates for the surface brightness of @xmath0  emission from a variety of physical processes .",
    "we frame the discussion in terms of a circumgalactic medium filled with cool clouds , and we present results in terms of quantities which can be directly measured from absorption - line observations using background sightlines .",
    "bright emission in the @xmath0  line typically occurs in gas at @xmath59 , thus we consider a highly idealized model of a population of cool gas clouds in quasar halos .",
    "several studies have previously explored similar models @xcite , and others have focused specifically on extended @xmath0  emission @xcite . nearly all of this work assumes the cool gas is in pressure equilibrium with a hot tenuous virialized plasma .",
    "although there may be some evidence for pressure confinement from our our absorption - line measurements @xcite , our conclusions about @xmath0  emission do not depend on the existence of a hot phase .",
    "we assume that the cool gas clouds observed in absorption are spherical with a single uniform hydrogen volume density @xmath60 , and that they are spatially uniformly distributed throughout a spherical halo of radius @xmath61 .",
    "although extremely simple , this model is also relevant , to within order unity geometric corrections , to more complicated distributions which vary with radius , or the filamentary structures expected in the cold accretion picture . in",
    "what follows , we often employ averages over the projected area of the spherical halo on the sky which we denote with angle brackets , e.g. the average line - of - sight distance through the halo is @xmath62 . besides the volume density @xmath60 and the size of the halo @xmath61",
    ", two other parameters completely specify the spatial distribution of the gas , namely the hydrogen column density of the individual clouds @xmath63 , and the cloud covering factor @xmath64 , which is similarly defined to be an average over the sphere .",
    "we focus on these four parameters ( @xmath61,@xmath60,@xmath63 , @xmath64 ) because they are either directly observable or are closely related to absorption - line observations .",
    "all other quantities of interest can then be expressed in terms of these four parameters .",
    "for example , of particular interest for computing the @xmath0  surface brightness is the volume filling factor defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by the clouds to the total volume , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number density of clouds and @xmath67 is their volume . the definition of the covering factor is f_c ds[eqn : cov_fact ] , where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the cloud cross - sectional area .",
    "this gives @xmath70 for our case of uniformly distributed clouds .",
    "note that in general the covering factor can be larger than unity .",
    "the corresponding volume filling factor can be written as f_v= , and the total mass of cool gas is then m_c = r^3 f_v = r^2 f_cn_h [ eqn : mc ] , where @xmath71 is the mass of the proton and @xmath72 is the hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "as we will consider emission from objects at high redshift , for which the size of the emitting clouds could be unresolved by our instrument , the relevant observable is the surface brightness @xmath73 averaged over the projected area of a sphere as measured from earth .",
    "the specific intensity of @xmath0  from our spherical halo is given by integrating the equation of radiative transfer through the gas distribution i_ly = j_ly ds [ eqn : radtrans ] , where @xmath74 is the volume emissivity per steradian @xmath75 .",
    "in this and the following sections we will ignore the attenuation of @xmath0  radiation caused by resonant scattering of gas within the halo itself or by the igm , as well as extinction caused by dust . scattering within the halo itself would only change the spatial distribution of the emission , and as we are averaging over apertures on the sky , this should produce small effects",

    "[ sec : scatt ] .",
    "scattering by the igm is likely negligible for the redshifts we consider @xcite .",
    "we estimate the impact of extinction by dust in the appendix , and demonstrate that it should not result in a significant reduction of the @xmath0  emission .",

    "[ eqn : sb_thick ] ) . however , scattering will typically be about @xmath15 times fainter than optically thick recombinations if the covering factors are the same because @xmath132 , which results from the assumption of @xmath133 , and from the relative amount of ionizing photons to @xmath0  photons emitted by a typical quasar .",
    "one expects this scattering emission to be important , therefore , only in regimes where the gas is optically thin at the lyman limit .",
    "indeed , the surface brightness of scattering ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_scatt ] ) and optically thin fluorescence ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_thin ] ) can be comparable , but have very different dependencies on gas distribution and quasar luminosity . throughout this work we estimate @xmath134 by tying the composite quasar spectrum of @xcite to the sdss optical photometry ( covering rest - frame uv wavelengths ) and computing the peak of the @xmath0  emission line",
    "there are two important points that can be made about the surface brightness of extended @xmath0  emission , and its implications for the supply of cool gas .",
    "first , optically thin and optically thick fluorescence can result in comparable levels of emission , as can pure resonant scattering of a central source of @xmath0  photons . to complicate matters further ,",
    "cooling radiation , that is collisional excitation of @xmath0 , can also lead to comparable emission .",
    "in general , the only way to determine which mechanism is at work is to use diagnostics from additional emission lines .",
    "for instance , the detection of strong extended balmer line emission would be provide compelling evidence for recombinations , and effectively rule out scattering and cooling . but given that balmer lines are redshifted into the near - ir for @xmath135 , detecting even h@xmath11 would be a daunting observational task because of the low expected surface brightness . furthermore , even if one is certain that recombination is the physical mechanism , it is still typically impossible to ascertain the ionization state of the gas , and hence whether it is optically thin or thick to , it is possible to rule out optically thin clouds via eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : nhi ] ) .",
    "however , this requires that the ionizing flux can be measured , which is possible for quasars but not hzrgs or labs . ] .",
    "the second and related point is that measurements of the @xmath0  surface brightness alone can not be used to determine the cool gas mass . for recombinations ,",
    "the surface brightness scales as @xmath136 if the gas is optically thin ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_thin ] ) , or as @xmath137 if it is optically thick ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_thick ] ) . whereas , for scattering the scaling is @xmath138 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_scatt ] ) . the total cool gas mass scales with the different combination @xmath139 ( eqn .  [ eqn : mc ] ) .",
    "even if we have perfect knowledge of the mechanism ( recombinations versus scattering ) and the ionization state ( optically thin or optically thick ) , the cool gas mass is not uniquely specified by the @xmath0  emission alone .",
    "note that the situation is even worse for @xmath0  cooling radiation because of an exponential dependence on an unknown gas temperature @xcite .",
    "thus even in the best - case scenario where balmer line observations point to recombinations , one will not know whether the gas is optically thin or thick , and hence which dependence on physical parameters to use .    the following worked example illustrates the aforementioned issues .",
    "consider a relatively bright @xmath34 quasar with apparent magnitude of @xmath140 .",
    "using the procedure in appendix a of @xcite , we determine the specific luminosity to be , @xmath141 at the lyman limit , and @xmath142 in @xmath0 . now consider three distinct cool gas distributions , one optically thin to ionizing photons with parameters ( @xmath143 ) = ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , 1.0 ) , another optically thick to ionizing photons with ( @xmath147 ) = ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , 0.01 ) , and a third optically thin to ionizing photons but optically thick to @xmath0  photons with ( @xmath143 ) = ( @xmath148 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , 2.0 ) .",
    "these very different cool gas distributions result in nearly identical average @xmath0  surface brightness @xmath153 over an @xmath154 halo .",
    "for the first two models the emission is powered by photoionization , whereas for the third it is pure @xmath0  scattering .",
    "but note also that for the first distribution , @xmath0  scattering contributes at very nearly the same surface brightness level @xmath155 as optically thin photoionization , implying that disentangling the two mechanisms via say detection of balmer lines would be challenging .",
    "these sizes and surface brightness levels are in line with the brightest @xmath0  blobs surveyed by @xcite ( rescaled to @xmath34 ) as well as the extended @xmath0  nebulae detected around @xmath156 hzrgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radio - loud quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the first optically thin model",
    "the total cool gas mass is @xmath157 , for the second optically thick model it is @xmath158 , and for the @xmath0  scattering case it is @xmath159 .",
    "thus variations of @xmath160 in the total gas mass can all lead to comparable levels of extended @xmath0  emission , and even if one were sure that photoionization was powering the emission ( from balmer lines ) and/or detected the source of ionizing photons ( an unobscured quasar ) , there is no way to determine whether the gas is optically thin or thick . plugging the observed observed surface brightness @xmath161 , distance @xmath61 , and ionizing luminosity @xmath162 into eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : nhi ] ) for the area averaged neutral column gives @xmath163 , and thus we can not distinguish an optically thin from an optically thick scenario .      in the previous subsection",
    "we saw that a variety of physical processes and a wide range of gas distributions can all lead to comparable @xmath0  emission .",
    "hence , the great value of quasar pairs is that absorption - line observations of b / g quasars can provide crucial information about the physical properties of the gas in the cgm of the f / g quasar .",
    "indeed , all the physical parameters ( @xmath164 ) can be determined from absorption line observations , provided that the covering factor is high enough for the clouds to be occasionally intercepted by b / g sightlines .",
    "for example , we map out the covering factor of optically thick absorption as a function of impact parameter ( see figure  [ fig : cov_fact ] ) in  [ sec : cov_fact ] ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and find a high covering factor of cool , optically thick gas around all bright quasars at @xmath39 . in @xcite , we conducted detailed absorption line modeling of a single projected pair and determined that the column densities of the absorbing clouds are typically @xmath165 and volume densities @xmath166 , although it is unclear whether this single system is representative .",
    "armed with this knowledge of the gas distribution , one can then interpret the physical implications of the presence or absence of extended line emission .",
    "note however that the properties of gas with a very low covering factor @xmath167 are much more challenging to measure , since thousands of background sources would be required to map it out .",
    "thus a crucial caveat in comparing absorption line observations to emission line observations is that the _ gas responsible for the detected emission may arise from clouds with a much lower covering factor than the gas dominating the absorption_. nevertheless , one can still make quantitative statements about the expected emission from the component of gas which is detected in absorption , which will have the highest covering factor .",
    "this is the approach adopted in this work .",
    "but even if quasar pairs are useful for measuring the properties of the quasar cgm , why use quasar pairs , as opposed to individual isolated quasars , to searching for diffuse emission lines ? consider the following four scenarios which are illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "a ) the absorbers / emitters are large resolved clouds at a ` random ' location in the quasar cgm ( figure  [ fig : cartoon]a ) . in this case",
    ", the background sightlines pinpoint the locations of gas and thereby determine where to look for emission .",
    "this approach is akin to that taken by @xcite , who purported to detect quasar fluorescence from an optically thick absorber detected in a b / g sightline . for this case of large resolved absorbers ,",
    "the relevant sb estimate is the mirror approximation ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_mirror ] ) .",
    "b ) another possibility is that the clouds are small and hence unresolved by our instrument , but that the gas resides in large resolved filamentary complexes which cover a fraction of the quasar halo ( figure  [ fig : cartoon]b ) . for this case",
    ", the b / g sightline intersects a filament by construction , and identifies the location where emission is expected via longslit observations of the quasar pair .",
    "note that the average sbs computed in  [ sec : form ] would underestimate the true sb in this case , since they include a reduction by the covering factor @xmath64 , due to regions devoid of gas .",
    "c ) it could also be that the clouds are small and hence unresolved , but some quasars have cool gas complexes and others do not .",
    "this bimodality in gas supply could result in the ` hits ' and misses which give rise to the observed covering factor ( figure  [ fig : cartoon]c ) . in this case",
    ", the quasar pairs are helpful since the background sightline identifies which objects to search for emission around , and the average sbs that we computed in  [ sec : form ] are again underestimated because the covering factor includes objects with no gas .",
    "d ) finally , the clouds could be small and hence unresolved , and distributed rather uniformly in the quasar halo ( figure  [ fig : cartoon]d ) . in this case",
    "the background sightline does not provide us with useful information about where to search for emission .",
    "the average sb appropriately accounts for the dilution by the covering factor @xmath64 , and this is the sb that we expect to detect at any spatial position along the slit . for this case",
    ", a search for diffuse emission around isolated individual quasars , i.e. not residing in pairs , would be just as effective .",
    "our goal is to conduct a sensitive search for extended @xmath0  emission from the cgm and igm around f / g quasars in quasar pairs , and to relate these emission constraints to our knowledge of the distribution of gas from absorption - line measurements of b / g sightlines .",
    "we concentrate on a unique sample of projected quasar pairs useful for exploring the cgm / igm surrounding high-@xmath168 quasars and , by inference , the massive galaxies and dark matter halos which host them .",
    "we search for extended @xmath0  emission around 29 @xmath156 quasars , which are drawn from a parent sample of @xmath169 projected quasar pairs . before delving into details",
    ", we briefly summarize the criteria used to select these 29 quasar pairs :    * the cgm / igm around the f / g quasar exhibits strong and optically thick absorption in the b / g quasar sightline . * the transverse separation of the pair and magnitude of the f / g quasar imply a fluorescent mirror surface brightness @xmath170 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_mirror ] ) . *",
    "a deep spectroscopic observation of the f / g quasar was obtained covering @xmath0  , allowing us to perform a sensitive search for @xmath0  emission on scales of tens to hundreds of kpc . *",
    "the two quasars are separated by velocity @xmath171 , to ensure that they are indeed projected and not physically associated .",
    "although our search for extended @xmath0  emission is focused on sightlines showing strong absorbers , we characterize the covering factor of optically thick absorbers using the full unbiased parent sample of 68 projected quasar pairs .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that the cgm surrounding @xmath39 quasars has a high @xmath172 covering fraction of optically thick gas to radius @xmath173kpc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are several reasons why we restrict our search for emission to only pair sightlines showing strong absorbers .",
    "first , in the context of fluorescence from the igm , powered either by the uvb or boosted by a nearby quasar , emission from optically thick clouds will always dominate over optically thin gas because the density of gas in the optically thin @xmath0  forest is just too low ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see also eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_thin ] ) .",
    "although this may not hold true in the cgm , where gas densities can be higher , note that the the mirror sb from a spatially resolved optically thick cloud is independent of the gas properties ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_mirror ] ) , and the same holds for emission from a population of optically thick clouds provided the covering factor has been measured ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_thick ] ) .",
    "in contrast , optically thin emission depends on the combination @xmath120 which is typically unknown .",
    "the upshot is that a non - detection of emission from gas which is optically thin could result either from @xmath174 being too low , or because the gas is not illuminated by the quasar . whereas , interpretation of non - detection of emission from optically thick gas is unambiguous , and implies that the gas is not illuminated by the quasar  by dust , but we show in appendix a that this effect is not significant . ] .",
    "note however , that given the high covering factor of optically thick gas in the quasar cgm , statistically , there is a high probability that any long - slit observation of a projected quasar pair will intersect optically thick material , even if the b / g sightline does not show absorption .",
    "we refer the reader to the discussion in  [ sec : cartoon ] and figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , which illustrates , nevertheless , why having a b / g sightline showing optically thick absorption can be advantageous .    in the following subsections we describe the details of the quasar pair survey , the spectroscopic observations , the definition of the quasar - absorber sample , and present our measurement of the covering factor of optically thick absorbers from the parent sample .",
    "modern spectroscopic surveys select _ against _ close pairs of quasars because of fiber collisions . for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ,",
    "the finite size of optical fibers precludes discovery of pairs with separation @xmath175 ) of the area of the sdss spectroscopic survey covered by overlapping plates .",
    "because the same area of sky was observed spectroscopically on more than one occasion , the effects of fiber collisions are reduced . ]",
    "thus , to find pairs with sub - arcminute separations , additional follow - up spectroscopy is required both to spectroscopically confirm quasar pair candidates , and to obtain spectra of sufficient quality to search for absorption line systems .    in an ongoing survey , close",
    "quasar pair candidates are selected from a photometric quasar catalog @xcite , and are confirmed via spectroscopy on 4 m class telescopes including : the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) , the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , the multiple mirror 6.5 m telescope , and the calar alto observatory ( caha ) 3.5 m telescope .",

    "about two - thirds of the targeted pairs consist of projected pairs of quasars ( @xmath180 ) at different redshifts ; the rest were physically associated binary quasars .    for the keck observations",

    "the higher dispersion , better sensitivity , and extended coverage in the red provided high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the emission line and also enabled a more sensitive search for metal - line absorption in the b / g quasar ( see prochaska et al .  in prep . ) .",

    "about half of our lris observations were taken after the atmospheric dispersion corrector was installed , which reduced slit - losses ( for point sources ) in the uv .",
    "the gemini data were taken with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; * ? ? ?",

    "we used the b@xmath189 grating which has 1200 lines mm@xmath53 and is blazed at 5300   .",

    "the wavelength center depended on the redshift of the quasar pair being observed .",

    "the motivation for the shorter ( total ) integrations was to conduct a survey to build up a statistical sample of b / g absorption line spectra at small impact parameter from the f / g quasars .",
    "the goal of the longer integrations was to obtain high - quality spectra of a subset of quasar pairs and to search for low sb @xmath0  emission near the f / g quasar .",

    "the only other criteria imposed are that we must have obtained a spectroscopic observation of the quasar pair with gemini or keck covering @xmath0  at the f / g quasar redshift , and we require that the velocity difference between the f / g and b / g quasar be @xmath171 to ensure that the two quasar are not physically associated .",

    "a similar procedure was employed for gemini gmos using standard star spectra taken at a variety of central wavelengths .",
    "we apply this archived sensitivity function to the b / g quasar spectrum , and then integrate the flux - calibrated 1-d spectrum against the sdss @xmath264-band filter curve .",

    "a comparison of our 1-d spectra flux calibrated in this way to the sdss spectra typically show agreement to within @xmath265 in the region of wavelength overlap . given that sdss spectra have spectrophotometric errors of @xmath236 @xcite , that @xmath264-band photometric errors ( used for our renormalization ) are about @xmath266 for a typical source with @xmath267 , and that quasar variability over @xmath268 year timescales ( between when the sdss photometry and our spectra were taken ) could result in a @xmath236 fluctuation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider @xmath269 agreement between our spectra and the sdss spectra to be reasonable .",
    "this procedure of rescaling the sensitivity functions to match photometry is effective for point source flux - calibration , however a subtlety arises in relation to calibrating extended emission .",
    "the point source counts will be reduced because of improper object centering due to guiding errors or inaccuracies in slit / mask alignment , and because a fraction of the spatial psf lies outside the slit area .",
    "these point - source slit - losses do not , however , reduce the amount of spatially resolved emission , which is of interest here .",
    "thus , renormalizing to point - source photometry will tend to over - estimate our surface brightness detection limit and underestimate our sensitivity .",
    "hence , our procedure is to apply the rescaled sensitivity functions ( based on point source photometry ) to our 2-d images , but reduce them by a geometric slit - loss factor so that we properly treat extended emission .    to compute the slit - losses we use the measured spatial fwhm to determine the fraction of light going through our @xmath270 slits , but we do not model centering errors . a useful check on our flux calibration procedure is to examine any residual variation in our renormalized sensitivity functions after the effects of the atmospheric extinction ( i.e. due to airmass ) and slit - losses are removed .",
    "these variations in the spectroscopic zero - point could be due either to transparency variations or to other systematic flux calibration errors .",
    "we find a 35% relative variation ( @xmath1 ) about the mean zero - point , which is at a level that can be plausibly explained by transparency variations in clear but non - photometric conditions",
    ". if these variations in zero - point are indeed due to transparency fluctuations , then our procedure of renormalizing to the photometry effectively takes them out .",

    "indeed , our detailed absorption line modeling of one member of our sample sdssj1204@xmath2910221 in qpq3 , yielded very small cloud sizes @xmath376 , relative to the typical @xmath377 resolution implied by our ground based seeing , although it is still unclear whether this one system represents the typical properties of gas in the quasar cgm .",
    "nevertheless , even for such unresolved clouds ( cloud sizes @xmath378 ) the high covering factor , @xmath64 , of optically thick gas still implies significant resolved @xmath0  flux , resulting from the collective emission of a population of unresolved clouds ( see figure  [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "thus , while an appeal to small clouds can explain our null detections of @xmath0  mirror fluorescence from the individual cloud absorbing the background sightline , a large sb is still expected from unresolved clouds .",
    "the second explanation is that we have substantially over - estimated @xmath349 because we have assumed the gas is at distance @xmath197 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sb_mirror ] ) , whereas in reality it lies at a significantly larger distance @xmath379 , where @xmath380 is the unknown line - of - sight distance .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g.  [ sec : cov_fact ] ) , but we observe a decrease for @xmath383 , both for our parent sample shown in figure  [ fig : cov_fact ] as well as in larger samples @xcite .",
    "the presence of this dropoff at @xmath384 indicates that we are indeed probing gas interior to the quasar halo on scales @xmath385 .",
    "second , our absorption line analysis of one member of our sample in @xcite revealed extreme kinematics and a very high metallicity in comparison to the typical properties of llss , implying that this gas is local to the very atypical f / g quasar environment .",
    "we also find large equivalent widths for low - ion transitions ( e.g.  1334 ) for the parent sample @xcite , which are uncharacteristic of optically thick absorbers along random quasar sightlines .",
    "it is conceivable however , that optically thick absorbers very close to the quasar are photoionized away , resulting in a donut - like radial distribution . in this case , the absorbers in our sample with the the smallest impact parameters @xmath4 and highest corresponding mirror surface brightness , could actually be at much larger physical distances of @xmath386 , reducing the anticipated sb by factors @xmath387 .",
    "a clustering analysis of our full sample of optically thick absorbers around quasars will be presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also qpq2 ) ; there we explore the degree to which donut like distributions can be ruled out .",
    "note , however , that we do observe evidence for an increased frequency of the highest column density absorbers ( sub - dlas and dlas ) at the smallest impact parameters @xmath388 , ( qpq1,qpq2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the obvious interpretation is that this results from increased covering factor and/or column density at smaller radii , again implying that the true radius is comparable to the impact parameter .",
    "finally , note that even if a donut like radial distribution implies that we have overestimated the sbs for the smallest impact parameters ( @xmath389 ) , we still could have detected @xmath0  emission from optically thick gas at @xmath54 in @xmath390 out of @xmath391 members of our sample at high statistical significance .",
    "based on all of these arguments , we conclude that radial distances much larger than the impact parameters are unlikely , and therefore do not explain our null detections .    in the appendix",
    "we consider the third explanation , that resonantly trapped @xmath0  photons are extincted by dust grains , in detail .",
    "there we show that , given reasonable assumptions about the column density and ionization state of absorbers in the quasar cgm , and rather conservative assumptions about the metallicity and hence dust content of this gas , extinction by dust grains can result in a factor of at most @xmath392 reduction in the total @xmath0  emission .",
    "furthermore , this estimate applies to the case of @xmath0  photons generated uniformly throughout the volume of an emitting cloud , as it would be for collisionally - excited cooling radiation .",
    "it thus likely overestimates the attenuation of fluorescent @xmath0  photons from an externally illuminated optically thick absorber . in these self - shielding clouds ,",
    "@xmath0  photons traverse a smaller optical depth before escaping than we assumed in the appendix .",
    "having cast significant doubt on the other three interpretations , we consider the last possibility , that the optically thick gas detected in b / g sightlines is not illuminated by the quasar , as the most probable explanation for our null detections . in principle",
    "this could result from either of two physical effects , anisotropic emission of the quasars ionizing radiation , or intermittent emission by the quasar on timescales comparable to the light crossing time @xmath393 for @xmath394 ( see also discussion in qpq2 ) .",
    "note however that the frequent detection of extended @xmath0  fuzz at distances @xmath395 ( see  [ sec : fuzz ] ) indicates that quasars emit continuously for at least @xmath396 , hence under the intermittency interpretation the duration of quasar emission bursts would have to follow a very narrow distribution , which seems rather unphysical .",
    "we thus favor the anisotropic emission interpretation , which results if , e.g. the f / g quasar is obscured from some vantage points , and the optically thick gas we do detect in b / g sightlines is _ shadowed_. in addition to the absence of fluorescent @xmath0  emission , several independent pieces of evidence support this hypothesis : ( 1 ) in the context of unified models of agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these values are comparable to typical ratios in dlas , suggesting a low - ionization state ; ( 5 ) at distances of @xmath398 , several studies indicate that the ionizing radiation emission from the quasar will photoionize all but the densest gas @xcite .",
    "if the quasar emits its radiation anisotropically , we can crudely estimate the solid angle of the emission @xmath399 , and consequently the implied fraction of agn which are obscured @xmath400 . in the picture",

    "note that in this context , the covering factor that we estimated in ",

    "( [ eqn : cov_fact ] ) for the observed covering factor @xmath401 , where @xmath64 now represents the intrinsic covering factor , e.g. before the quasar turns on .",

    "* ) .      in the previous section",
    ", we argued that the absence of significant @xmath0  emission from optically thick gas in the f / g quasar cgm indicates that this material is not illuminated by the quasar .",

    "given that this fuzz tends to be asymmetrically distributed , and that our single - slit orientation covers only a fraction of the area around the quasar , the true detection rate of such fuzz is expected to be significantly higher . our detection rate is hence about a factor of two lower than the frequency of @xmath409 deduced from the more recent studies of this small - scale @xmath0  fuzz @xcite , although limited statistics , sample inhomogenities , differing methodologies , and our single position angle preclude a quantitative comparison .",

    "considering together both the detected small scale fuzz emission , which implies a small covering factor @xmath415 , and the lack of large - scale nebulosity from gas with a high @xmath416 covering factor established by b / g sightlines , the picture that emerges is that clouds with a range of densities and covering factors exist in the cgm around quasars . in the absence of ionizing photons , a low density @xmath417 population dominates the covering factor , and it is this gas that we typically observe in absorption with b / g sightlines . in contrast , the denser clouds ( @xmath418 ) cover only a tiny fraction of the line - of - sight @xmath419 .",
    "when illuminated by the f / g quasar , the lower density ( high covering factor ) clouds are photoionized by the intense quasar radiation , whereas the dense clouds ( low covering factor ) can self - shield and survive .",

    "it is intriguing that the properties of the lae in sdssj0856@xmath2911158 resemble those of the candidate fluorescing source closest to the quasar in @xcite .",

    "furthermore , if it were established that @xmath550 , then this would be very compelling evidence for fluorescence because normal stellar populations are not expected to produce ews above this value . given our current relatively weak constraints on the ew , it is not possible to make a convincing statement about whether the lae in sdssj0856@xmath2911158 results from clustering or fluorescence .",
    "deep broad band imaging of the lae in sdssj0856@xmath2911158 could be used to obtain a much more sensitive constraint on the continuum , distinguishing between these two scenarios .",
    "in this paper we introduced a novel technique to simultaneously analyze the absorption line and emission line properties of cgm and igm gas around a quasar using close projected quasar pairs .",

    "the primary results of this survey and our analysis are :    * fluorescent @xmath0  emission with properties expected in the ` mirror ' approximation , is _ not _ detected at the locations of any of the 29 optically thick absorbers pinpointed by the b / g quasar sightlines , although we had the sensitivity to detect this signal in 24/29 sources at @xmath359 significance .",

    "for example , our detailed analysis of sdssj1204 + 0221  in @xcite showed metallicities in the range @xmath583 , and our expectation is that a more typical metallicity of the quasar cgm @xmath584 ( * ? ? ? * prochaska et al .",

    "<S> we have constructed a sample of 29 close projected quasar pairs where the background quasar spectrum reveals absorption from optically thick gas associated with the foreground quasar . </S>",
    "<S> these unique sightlines allow us to study the quasar circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) in absorption and emission _ simultaneously _ , because the background quasar pinpoints large concentrations of gas where @xmath0  emission , resulting from quasar - powered fluorescence , resonant @xmath0  scattering , and/or cooling radiation , is expected . a sensitive search ( @xmath1 surface - brightness limits of @xmath2 ) for diffuse @xmath0  emission in the environments of the foreground ( predominantly radio - quiet ) quasars </S>",
    "<S> is conducted using gemini / gmos and keck / lris slit spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we fail to detect large - scale @xmath3 @xmath0  emission , neither at the location of the optically thick absorbers nor in the foreground quasar halos , in all cases except a single system . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these non - detections as evidence that the gas detected in absorption is shadowed from the quasar uv radiation due to obscuration effects , which are frequently invoked in unified models of agn . </S>",
    "<S> small - scale @xmath4 extended @xmath0  nebulosities are detected in @xmath5 of our sample , which are likely the high - redshift analogs of the extended emission - line regions ( eelrs ) commonly observed around low - redshift ( @xmath6 ) quasars . </S>",
    "<S> this may be fluorescent recombination radiation from a population of very dense clouds with a low covering fraction illuminated by the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect a compact high rest - frame equivalent width ( @xmath7 ) @xmath0-emitter with luminosity @xmath8 at small impact parameter @xmath9 from one foreground quasar , and argue that it is more likely to result from quasar - powered fluorescence , than simply be a star - forming galaxy clustered around the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> our observations imply that much deeper integrations with upcoming integral - field spectrometers such as muse and kcwi will be able to routinely detect a diffuse @xmath0  glow around bright quasars on scales @xmath10 and thus directly image the cgm . </S>"
