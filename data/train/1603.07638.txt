    "in weak electric fields the velocity of ions depends linearly on the electric field @xmath3 : @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the ion mobility , which is a property of the gas mixture .",
    "large build - up of ( slow ) ions imposes a challenge for tpcs running at high interaction rates and particle multiplicities , as will be the case of the upgraded alice tpc@xcite .",
    "knowledge of @xmath1 is necessary in order to simulate such space charges .",
    "figure [ vci : fig : principle ] shows a schematic of the used detector .",
    "the ions produced in gem3 and gem2 induce a signal on gem1 as they leave the gem stack .",
    "this signal provides the start time for the measurement .",
    "afterwards the ions drift in a uniform electric field towards a wire grid . behind the grid a similar field is set using a mesh . throughout the time of the drift a signal",
    "is induced ( see fig . [",
    "vci : fig : principle ] ) on the grid .",
    "since this signal can have a length of a few , a preamplifier suited for these signals is used .",
    "in addition the readout is chosen such that the signals are read out with as less additional shaping by the electronics as possible . + as the ions pass through the grid , the polarity of the induced signal on it changes polarity .",
    "garfield@xcite simulations show that the zero crossing of the signal amplitude does not correspond to the arrival time of the ions at the grid .",
    "instead it turns out that the derivative of the signal peaks at the expected arrival time .",
    "hence the inflection point of the signal is used for the end of the drift time measurement .",
    "for a given gas mixture , both signals are recorded for various field settings . then for each of these sets , the grid signal is differentiated and @xmath5 is extracted .",
    "as derived e.g in @xcite no change in the mobility of a gas mixture is expected for the applied fields . hence the different @xmath1 values for each @xmath3 are averaged . from the recorded temperature ( @xmath6 ) and atmospheric pressure ( @xmath7 ) present during the measurement , the reduced mobility @xmath8",
    "is calculated by : @xmath9",
    "+    several mixtures of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath2 have been studied and the resulting ion mobilities are summarised in fig .",
    "[ vci : fig : results : nearco2 ] . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the drifting ions in both kinds of gas mixture are @xmath2 ions or larger molecules based on @xmath2 .",
    "hence the mobility of @xmath2 ions was measured in all cases .",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath2 results ( squares in fig .",
    "[ vci : fig : results : arco2 ] ) agree well with the points ( crosses ) obtained by schultz et al . , measured at similar conditions as in the set - up presented here .",
    "however , @xmath12 seems to be under - estimated as compared to the results from the coimbra group ( triangles ) . in case of the @xmath11-@xmath2 measurements ( fig .",
    "[ vci : fig : results : neco2 ] ) the same is true . since it is argued that water lowers the mobility , this discrepancy might be explained by the different water content .",
    "the same explanation can be applied to the budapest measurements@xcite as well . to confirm that water has this effect , the @xmath1 dependence on @xmath13 was also studied .",
    "a decrease of the mobility for increasing water content is observed .",
    "this is shown in the different squares at @xmath2 concentration in fig .",
    "[ vci : fig : results : neco2 ] .",
    "+ furthermore a pressure of was present during the coimbra measurement .",
    "the charge transfer and clustering processes of gas atoms and molecules at low pressures are expected to be different than at atmospheric pressure .",
    "this contributes to the difference between this work and the results of the coimbra group as well .",
    "+ according to blanc s law , the inverse of the mobility in a two component gas mixture  with changing ratio among the two parts  can be described by a linear function@xcite . from this function",
    "the mobility of the drifting ions in the pure gases , forming the mixture , can be extrapolated .",
    "the @xmath2 mobility in @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath14 is determined by such a fit to the squares in fig .",

    "[ vci : table : co2mob ] these mobilities are listed . from the difference between the two @xmath2 mobilities in @xmath2 ( obtained in @xmath10-@xmath2 and @xmath11-@xmath2 ) the accuracy of the measurement can be estimated to be better than .",
    ".the here tabulated values are the mobilities of @xmath2 ions in the given gases .",
    "they were calculated from a fit of blanc s law@xcite to the mobilities shown in figure [ vci : fig : results : arco2 ] ( upper table ) and [ vci : fig : results : neco2 ] ( lower table ) .",
    "the errors of the fit are given . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a set - up to measure the mobility of ions was built and successfully commissioned . from two signals indicating the start and the end of the ion drift",
    ", the drift times were extracted and the mobility was calculated .",
    "differentiation of the signal induced by ions on a wire grid allows for a consistent determination of the arrival time there .",

    "the measured @xmath12 of @xmath14 in @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is up to ( ) lower .",
    "such a difference may be explained by different @xmath13 contents and different pressures . it was confirmed that the admixture of water decreases the mobility in @xmath11-@xmath14 ( 90 - 10 ) . for an increase of in water",
