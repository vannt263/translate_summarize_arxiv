    "[ scaling ] ) , our evolution obeys the expected scaling during the magnetic winding phase , and the qualitative outcome of the simulations remains the same . however , since the mri grows on a timescale @xmath97 regardless of the initial magnetic field strength , it is possible that , for very weak initial fields , the effects of the mri could dominate the evolution long before the effects of magnetic braking become important . in this case",
    ", the scaling of our numerical results with the alfvn time ( relevant for magnetic winding ) may break down .",
