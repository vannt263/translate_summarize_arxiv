    "this paper uses techniques in noncommutative geometry as developed by alain connes @xcite in order to prove a twisted higher index theorem for elliptic operators on orbifold covering spaces of compact good orbifolds , which are invariant under a projective action of the orbifold fundamental group .",
    "these higher indices are basically the evaluation of pairings of higher traces ( which are cyclic cocycles arising from the orbifold fundamental group and the multiplier defining the projective action ) with the index of the elliptic operator , considered as an element in the @xmath0-theory of some completion of the twisted group algebra of the orbifold fundamental group .",
    "this paper is the continuation of @xcite and generalizes the results there .",
    "the main purpose for studying the twisted higher index theorem on orbifolds is to highlight the fact that when the orbifold is not smooth , then the twisted higher index can be a _",
    "fraction_. in particular , we determine the range of the higher cyclic traces on @xmath0-theory for general cocompact fuchsian groups .",
    "we adapt and generalize the discrete model of the quantum hall effect of bellissard and his collaborators @xcite and also @xcite , to the case of general cocompact fuchsian groups and orbifolds , which can be viewed equivalently as the generalization to the equivariant context .",
    "the new phenomenon that we observe in our case is that the connes - kubo hall conductance has plateaux at integral multiples of a _ fractional _ valued _ topological invariant _ , namely the _ orbifold euler characteristic_. the presence of denominators is caused by the presence of cone points singularities and by the hyperbolic geometry on the complement of these cone points .",
    "the negative curvature of the hyperbolic structure replaces interaction and simulates , in our single electron model , the presence of coulomb interactions .",
    "we also have a geometric term in the hamiltonian ( arising from the cone point singularities ) which accounts partly for the effect of coulomb interactions .",
    "this geometric model of interaction is fairly simple , hence the agreement of our fractions with the experimental values is only partial . among the observed fractions , for instance , we can derive @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 from genus one orbifolds , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 from genus zero orbifolds , see  5 .",
    "however , fractions like @xmath13 and @xmath14 , seem unobtainable in this model , even including higher genus orbifolds .",
    "their explanation probably requires a more sophisticated term describing the electron interaction .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that this term may also be geometric in nature , but we leave it to future studies .",
    "there are currently several different models which describe the occurrence of fractional quantum numbers in the quantum hall effect .",
    "usually quantum field theoretic techniques are involved .",
    "most notably , there is a sophisticated chern - simons theory model for the fractional quantum hall effect developed by frohlich and his collaborators , cf .",
    "@xcite . also within the quantum field",
    "theoretic formalism it can be noticed that possibly different models are needed in order to explain the occurrence of different sets of fractions .",
    "for example , the fraction @xmath5 requires by itself a separate model .    after reviewing some preliminary material in section 1 ,",
    "we establish in section 2 a twisted higher index theorem which adapts the proofs of the index theorems of atiyah @xcite , singer @xcite , connes and moscovici @xcite , and gromov @xcite , @xcite , to the case of good orbifolds , that is , orbifolds whose orbifold universal cover is a smooth manifold .",
    "this theorem generalizes the twisted index theorem for @xmath15-traces of @xcite to the case of higher degree cyclic traces .",
    "the result can be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath16 be the algebra of rapidly decreasing sequences , i.e. @xmath17 let @xmath18 be a discrete group and @xmath19 be a multiplier on @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the twisted group algebra .",
    "we denote the tensor product @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the universal orbifold cover of a compact good orbifold @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 is a smooth manifold .",
    "suppose given a multiplier @xmath19 on @xmath18 and assume that there is a projective @xmath26-action on @xmath27 sections of @xmath18-invariant vector bundles over @xmath25 . by considering @xmath26-invariant elliptic operators @xmath28 acting on @xmath27 sections of these bundles",
    ", we will define a @xmath29-index element in @xmath0-theory @xmath30 we will compute the pairing of @xmath31 with higher traces . more precisely , given a normalized group cocycle @xmath32 , we define a cyclic cocycle @xmath33 of dimension @xmath34 on the twisted group algebra @xmath35 , which extends continuously to a @xmath34-dimensional cyclic cocycle on @xmath36 .",
    "this induces a map on @xmath0-theory , @xmath37 : k_0 ( \\mathcal{r}(\\gamma , \\sigma ) )   \\to { \\mathbb{c}}.\\ ] ] a main theorem established in this paper is a cohomological formula for @xmath38\\left({\\operatorname{ind}}_{\\sigma}({d})\\right).\\ ] ] our method consists of applying the connes - moscovici _ local _ higher index theorem to a family of idempotents constructed from the heat operator on @xmath39 , all of which represent the @xmath29-index .",
    "let @xmath18 be a fuchsian group of signature @xmath40 , that is , @xmath18 is the orbifold fundamental group of the 2 dimensional hyperbolic orbifold @xmath41 of signature @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the genus and @xmath44 denotes the cone angles at the cone points of the orbifold .",
    "in @xcite we computed the @xmath0-theory of the twisted group @xmath45 algebra . under the assumption",
    "that the dixmier - douady invariant of the multiplier @xmath19 is trivial , we obtained @xmath46 here we use a result of @xcite , which is a twisted analogue of a result of jollissant and which says in particular that , when @xmath18 is a cocompact fuchsian group , then the natural inclusion map @xmath47 induces an isomorphism in @xmath0-theory @xmath48 using this , together with our twisted higher index theorem for good orbifolds and some results in @xcite , and under the same assumptions as before , we determine , in section 3 , the range of the higher trace on @xmath0-theory @xmath37 ( k_0 ( c^*(\\gamma,\\sigma ) ) ) = \\phi{\\operatorname{\\mathbb z}},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the orbifold euler characteristic of @xmath50 . here we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the area 2-cocycle on @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath52 is the restriction to @xmath18 of the area 2-cocycle on @xmath53 .    in section 4",
    "we study the hyperbolic connes - kubo formula for the hall conductance in the discrete model of the quantum hall effect on the hyperbolic plane , where we consider cayley graphs of fuchsian groups which may have torsion subgroups .",
    "this generalizes the results in @xcite where only torsion - free fuchsian groups were considered .",
    "we recall that the results in @xcite generalized to hyperbolic space the noncommutative geometry approach to the euclidean quantum hall effect that was pioneered by bellissard and collaborators @xcite , connes @xcite and xia @xcite .",
    "we first relate the hyperbolic connes - kubo hall conductance cyclic 2-cocycle and the area cyclic 2-cocycle on the algebra @xmath54 , and show that they define the same class in cyclic cohomology .",
    "then we use our theorem on the range of the higher trace on @xmath0-theory to determine the range of values of the connes - kubo hall conductance cocycle in the quantum hall effect . the new phenomenon that we observe in this case",
    "is that the hall conductance has plateaux at all energy levels belonging to any gap in the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( known as the generalized harper operator ) , where it is now shown to be equal to an integral multiple of a _ fractional _ valued topological invariant @xmath55 , which is the negative of the orbifold euler characteristic of the good orbifold @xmath56 .",
    "if we fix the genus , then the set of possible denominators is finite by the hurwitz theorem @xcite , and has been explicitly determined in the low genus cases @xcite .",
    "this provides a topological explanation of the appearance of fractional quantum numbers . in the last section we compare our results with some observed values .    in section 5",
    ", we provide lists of specific examples of good 2-dimensional orbifolds for which @xmath55 is _ not _ an integer .",
    "first we observe how the presence of both the hyperbolic structure and the cone points is essential in order to have fractional quantum numbers .",
    "in fact , @xmath55 is an integer whenever the hyperbolic orbifold is smooth , i.e. whenever @xmath57 , which is the case considered in @xcite .",
    "similarly , by direct inspection , it is possible to see that all euclidean orbifolds also produce only _ integer _ values of @xmath55 .",
    "we use the class of orbifolds which are spheres or tori with cone points , having a ( singular ) hyperbolic structure , to represent in our physical model some of the fractions observed in the fqhe .",
    "we also list the examples arising from quotients of low genus surfaces @xcite , and we discuss some phenomenology on the role of the orbifold points and of the minimal genus @xmath58 of the covering surface .    summarizing , one key advantage of our model is that the fractions we get are obtained from an equivariant index theorem and are thus topological in nature .",
    "consequently , as pointed out in @xcite , the hall conductance is seen to be stable under small deformations of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , this model can be easily generalized to systems with disorder as in @xcite .",
    "this is a necessary step in order to establish the presence of plateaux @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of our model is that there is a small number of experimental fractions that we do not obtain in our model , and we also derive other fractions which do not seem to correspond to experimentally observed values . to our knowledge , however , this is also a limitation occuring in the other models available in the literature .    * acknowledgments : * we thank j. bellissard for his encouragement and for some useful comments .",
