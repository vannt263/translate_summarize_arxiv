    "associative algebras are fundamental ingredients in a number of theories and constructions in theoretical and mathematical physics .",
    "one of the most intriguing and unexpected  recent manifestation of their role is due to the discovery of witten [ 1 ] and dijkgraaf - verlinde - verlinde [ 2 ] .",
    "they showed that the properties of correlation functions @xmath0 for the two - dimensional topological field theory are encoded by the algebraic relations of the form    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the matrix inverse to the matrix of two - points correlation functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , for the deformed model the three - points correlation function @xmath6 is the third order derivative @xmath7 and the algebraic equations ( 1 ) take the form of the system of partial differential equations for f ( wdvv equation ) [ 1,2 ] .",
    "a remarkable fact is that  equations ( 1 ) are nothing else than the associativity conditions for the structure constants of the algebra of primary fields with the multiplication rule @xmath8 [ 1,2 ] and , hence , the wdvv  equation is the associativity condition for structure constants with a particular dependence on the deformation parameters @xmath9 .",
    "this observation was beautifully formalized in [ 3,4 ] as the theory of frobenius manifolds and then extended to the theory of f - manifolds in [ 5 ] .",
    "it turned out that the wdvv equation plays a fundamental role in the theory of quantum cohomology and other branches of algebraic geometry ( see e.g. [ 4,6 ] ) .",
    "thus , it was demonstrated that the associativity equation ( 1 ) and its deformed forms are fundamental objects encoding important information .    in this paper",
    "we will show that associativity equation plays similar role in two other quite important cases , namely , for the classical menelaus relation and fay s trisecant formula for riemann theta function .",
    "separated in time by 2000 years and arosen in a quite different branches of geometry both these formulas are nothing but the associativity condition for a certain three - dimensional algebra .",
    "the same is valid also for the bilinear discrete hirota - miwa equation for the kp hierarchy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly recall the basic formulas for the simplest wdvv equation .",
    "relation between menelaus configuration and theorem with associativity condition is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the kp case is considered in section 4 .",
    "the qauge equivalence of the menelaus and kp configurations is demonstrated in section 5 .",
    "in section 6 it is shown that fay s trisecant formula also is the associativity equation and a conjecture about the role of associative algebra in characterization of jacobian varieties is formulated .",
    "here we will discuss briefly the simplest wdvv  equation in order to recall its connection with the associativity condition and in order to use this construction further as a sort of guide .",
    "we will derive this equation in a manner which is slightly different from the usual one ( see [ 7,8 ] ) .",
    "thus , we consider a noncommutative three - dimensional associative algebra _ a _ with the unite element @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the algebra possess a commutative basis the elements of which we will denote as @xmath11 . the table of multiplication @xmath12 and    @xmath13    defines the structure constants a , b , c, ... ,n of the algebra _ a _ in this basis .",
    "the associativity of the algebra , i.e. the conditions @xmath14 ( conditions ( 1 ) ) in this case are equivalent to the following three equations    @xmath15    one of the ways to describe deformations of the structure constants a , b, ... ,n is to associate the following system of linear differential equations ( see e.g. [ 3 ] , [ 8 ] )    @xmath16    with the multiplication table ( 2 )  ( dirac s recipe [ 8 ] ) and require its compatibility , i.e.    @xmath17    here and below  @xmath18 etc .",
    "the corresponding system of nonlinear differential equations for the structure constants admits various reductions .",
    "one which we are interested in is @xmath19 . under this constraint",
    "the associativity conditions ( 3 ) are reduced to    @xmath20    and    @xmath21    while the system of differential equations becomes    @xmath22    this system is equivalent to the algebraic associativity conditions ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and differential exactness conditions    @xmath23    equations ( 9 ) imply the existence of a function f such that    @xmath24    the remaining associativity condition ( 7 ) thus becomes    @xmath25    it is the famous wdvv equation [ 1,2 ] .",
    "its algebro - geometrical significance is discussed in [ 4,6 ] .",
    "we note that the wdvv  equation ( 11 ) is nothing but the associativity equation ( 7 ) in parametrization ( 10 ) .",
    "several other integrable hydrodynamical type systems like the hirota - miwa equation for dispersionless kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) hierarchy admit analogous algebraic interpretation [ 7 ] .",
    "in order to approach the menelaus relation ( see e.g. [ 9,10 ] ) in a similar manner one should first choose an appropriate algebra .",
    "thus , we consider a noncommutative three - dimensional algebra _ _ a__@xmath26 without unite element .",
    "we assume that it possess the commutative basis with the elements @xmath27 for which the products of only distinct elements is defined .",
    "so , the multiplication table is    @xmath28    associativity conditions    @xmath29    for the structure constants of such algebra are    @xmath30    * lemma 1 . * for nonzero a , b, ... ,g the associativity conditions ( 14 ) are equivalent to the equation    @xmath31    and one of equations ( 14 ) , for instance , the equation    @xmath32    proof . multiplying the first of equations ( 14 ) by d , second by c and subtracting results , one gets ( 15 ) .",
    "the rest is straightforward .    to describe deformations of the structure constants defined by ( 12 ) one should , similar to the wdvv  case ,",
    "apply the dirac s recipe to a linear systems which will be realization of the table ( 12 ) .",
    "we choose the realization of @xmath33 by operators of shifts @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are deformation parameters [ 11 ] .",
    "the corresponding linear system is [ 11 ]    @xmath37    where @xmath38    here we assume that all structure constants are real but @xmath39 is a complex - valued .",
    "so , @xmath40 @xmath41  can be considered as points on the ( complex ) plane .",
    "thus , equations ( 17 ) with a , b, ... ,g obeying associativity conditions ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) define a configuration of six points on the plane",
    ".    there are at least two distinguished special configurations among them .",
    "the first corresponds to the case when    @xmath42    for such a , b, ...",
    ",g  the relations ( 17 ) , in virtue of the conditions ( 18 ) , mean that three points @xmath43 are collinear as well as the sets of points @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ".  then the relations ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) imply that the points @xmath46 are collinear too , i.e. @xmath47with @xmath48 .",
    "thus , in the case ( 18 ) the relations ( 17 ) describe the set of four triples @xmath49 and @xmath50 of collinear points .",
    "it is nothing but the celebrated menelaus configuration of the classical geometry ( figure 1 ) ( see e.g. [ 90 ] , [ 91 ] ) .        the relations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) allow us to express a , b,",
    "... ,g in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "one gets    @xmath51    where we denote by @xmath52 solution of the system ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) . in such a parametrization of a , b, ... ,g the associativity conditions ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) are equivalent to the single equation    @xmath53    it is the celebrated menelaus relation ( see [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ) which is necessary and sufficient condition for collinearity of the points @xmath46  for any three given points @xmath54  on the plane . in our formulation",
    "the menelaus relation ( 21 ) is nothing else than the associativity conditions ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) written in terms of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the  menelaus theorem is intimately connected with the associative algebra ( 12 ) with the choice ( 18 ) .    * proposition 1 . *  for a configuration of six points on the plane defined by equations ( 17 )  with the relation ( 18 ) the following two conditions are equivalent :    \\(a ) coefficients a , b, ... ,g in ( 17 ) obey the associativity equations ( 14 ) or ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) for the algebra ( 12 ) ,    \\(b ) points @xmath46 are collinear .    proof .",
    "an implication ( a)@xmath56 ( b ) has been proved above .",
    "now let us assume that points @xmath46 defined by ( 17 ) together with ( 18 ) are collinear for arbitrary points @xmath57 .",
    "this means that    @xmath58    with @xmath59 .",
    "substitution of expressions for @xmath60 given by ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) into ( 22 )  gives the  conditions    @xmath61    these conditions imply that @xmath62 . then the substitution of @xmath63 into the condition @xmath64 gives @xmath65 .",
    "it is easy to check that this equation is equivalent  to the first associtivity condition ( 14 ) . due to lemma 1",
    "these conditions are equivalent to all associativity conditions ( 14 ) @xmath66 .",
    "thus the menelaus configuration and theorem are just the geometric realizations of the associativity conditions for the algebra ( 12 ) .",
    "discrete deformations of the menelaus configurations are governed by discrete equations arising as compatibility conditions    @xmath67    for the system ( 17 ) .",
    "they are of the form    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    equations ( 24 ) , ( 25 ) imply that    @xmath72    which is equivalent to the relation ( 15 ) in virtue of the second equation ( 23 ) .",
    "thus , the menelaus relation ( 21 ) is preserved by deformations .",
    "discrete deformations of the menelaus configuration given by equations ( 23)-(26 ) generate an integrable lattice on the plane  [ 12 ] .",
    "another distinguished case corresponds to the choice    @xmath73    for which equations ( 17 ) take the form    @xmath74    with such a choice of a , b, ... ,g the relation ( 15 ) is a trivial identity and , hence , the associativity conditions are reduced to the single equation    @xmath75    geometrical configuration on the plane formed by six points @xmath76 @xmath77 with real a , c , e is a special one .",
    "we , first , observe that the points @xmath78 lie on the straight lines passing through the origin 0 and parallel to the straight lines passing through the points ( @xmath79 @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "then , due to the associativity condition ( 30 ) the points @xmath41 are collinear .",
    "indeed , equations ( 29 ) imply that    @xmath81    while the relation ( 30 ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath82thus , the points @xmath40 @xmath83 form the configuration on the complex plane shown on the figure 2 .",
    "configuration.,width=453 ]    the associativity condition ( 30 ) provides us also with the relation between the directed lengths for this configuration . indeed , expressing a , c , e from ( 29 ) in terms of @xmath39 and substituting into ( 30 ) , one gets    @xmath84    since for real a , c , e @xmath85 etc the formula ( 32 ) represents the relation between the directed lengths @xmath86 of the interval @xmath87 etc .",
    "we note that the straight line passing through the points @xmath41 is a trisecant of the family of three straight lines passing through origin .",
    "we will refer to the configuration presented in the figure 2 as kp configuration by the reason which will be clarified now .",
    "let us consider discrete deformations of such configurations .",
    "they are governed by equations ( 23)-(26 ) under the constraint ( 28 ) .    * lemma 2 . * in the case ( 28 ) equations ( 23)-(26 ) are equivalent to the associativity condition ( 30 ) and equations    @xmath88    proof . in this case equations ( 23 ) are reduced to equations ( 33 ) while equations ( 24)-(26 ) are equivalent to the single equation @xmath89 . due to ( 33 )",
    "this  equation is equivalent to the associativity condition ( 30)@xmath66 .",
    "equations ( 33 ) imply the existence of the function @xmath90 such that    @xmath91    substitution of these expressions into ( 30 ) gives    @xmath92    which is the celebrated discrete bilinear hirota - miwa equation for the kp hierarchy or the addition formula for kp @xmath93function [ 13 ] .",
    "this fact justifies the name of the configuration .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the hirota - miwa equation ( 35 ) is nothing but the associativity condition ( 30 ) with the structure constants a , c , e parametrized by @xmath90-function .",
    "we note that equations ( 29 ) with a , c , e of the form ( 34 ) coincide with well - known linear problems for the hirota - miwa bilinear equation [ 13 ] .",
    "similar to the menelaus case we thus have    * proposition 2 . *  for the six - points configuration on the plane defined by equations ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) the following conditions are equivalent :    \\(a ) coefficients a , e , c obey the associativity condition ( 30 ) ,    \\(b ) the points @xmath77 are collinear ,    \\(c ) function @xmath90 defined by ( 34 ) obeys the discrete hirota - miwa equation ( 35 ) .    proof .",
    "implications ( a)@xmath56(b ) and ( a)@xmath56 ( c ) have been proved above .",
    "implication ( b)@xmath56 ( a ) is obvious .",
    "then , multiplying equation ( 35 ) by @xmath94 , one gets ( 30 ) that proves ( c)@xmath56 ( a ) and , hence , ( c)@xmath56 ( b ) @xmath95",
    "the menelaus and kp configurations look quite different . for instance",
    ", the points @xmath43 etc are collinear in the menelaus case and they are not in the kp case . nevertheless , they are closely connected , namely , they are gauge equivalent to each other .",
    "a notion of gauge equivalency is a very well - known one in the theory of gauge fields as well in the  theory of integrable equations .  in our case",
    "the linear system ( 17 ) is invariant under the gauge transformations @xmath96 and    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is an arbitrary function .",
    "it is a simple check  that the system ( 23)-(26 ) is invariant under these gauge transformations too .",
    "* lemma 3 * [ 11 ] *  *  the relation ( 15 ) is invariant under the gauge transformations ( 36 ) .    proof .",
    "indeed , under the gauge transformation ( 36 ) one has    @xmath99    so the relation ( 15 ) is a characteristic one for orbits of gauge equivalent structure constants .",
    "gauge invariance of the general system ( 23)-(26 ) allows us to choose different gauges .",
    "first , we observe that    @xmath100    so , if for generic a , b, ... ,g one chooses the gauge function g to be a solution @xmath101 of the linear system ( 17 ) then the gauge transformed @xmath102 obey the relations    @xmath103    thus , the relation ( 18 ) discussed in section ( 3 ) selects a special gauge which is nothing but the distinguished menelaus gauge .",
    "solutions of the linear system ( 17 ) in this gauge are ratios of two solutions of the generic system ( 17 ) : @xmath104 .",
    "so , if one treats  solutions @xmath39 of the general system ( 17 ) as projective homogeneous coordinates , then in terms of affine coordinates @xmath105 it is the menelaus system ( system ( 17 ) with the relations ( 18 ) ) . in other words ,",
    "the menelaus configuration is the affine form of the generic configuration of six points defined by the system ( 17 ) .",
    "we note that the gauge transformation ( 36 ) geometrically means a local ( depending on a point ) homothetic transformation .",
    "now let us begin with the particular kp system ( 17 ) , i.e. when a , b, ... ,g obey the relations ( 28 ) .  in this case",
    "after the gauge transformation one has the relations ( 38 ) with b =- a , d =- c , g =- e . choosing g as a solution of the kp system ( 29 ) , one again gets ( 39 )",
    "so , kp and menelaus cases are qauge equivalent to each other and @xmath106 where @xmath107 are two distinct solutions of the system ( 29 ) . hence , in order to construct the menelaus configuration one needs two kp configurations with the same a , c , e .",
    "if one starts with the menelaus gauge then in order to get the relations @xmath108 one should consider the gauge transformation with g obeying the equations    @xmath109    it is a straightforward check that these equations are compatible due to the relations ( 15 ) and equations ( 23)-(26 ) .",
    "the same arguments shows that there exists a gauge transformation which converts the general system ( 17 ) into the kp linear system .",
    "thus , the menelaus and kp cases and configurations are two particular , but distinguished members of the orbit of structure constants generated by gauge transformations ( 36 ) .",
    "menelaus and kp gauges are distinguished also from the point of view of collinearity property for  the points @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , let us consider a family of configuration of six points defined by the system ( 17 ) for which points @xmath77 are collinear , i.e. @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to show that these conditions are satisfied if a , b, ... ,g obey the constraints @xmath62 and    @xmath112    due to the gauge freedom and admissibility of rescaling @xmath113 the condition ( 40 ) is gauge equivalent to the following @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the cases @xmath116 are all equivalent to the menelaus case @xmath117 by rescaling of a, ... ,g .",
    "the case @xmath118 corresponds to the kp gauge .",
    "the existence of the solutions for the kp @xmath93function in terms of the riemann theta function ( see e.g.[14 ] ) and well - known relation between the addition formula for kp  hierarchy and fay s trisecant formula ( see e.g. [ 15,16 ] ) suggest that the latter also is deeply connected with associativity .",
    "we will show here that it is indeed the case .",
    "we recall the fay s trisecant formula in its original form ( see [ 15 ] ) .",
    "let x is a riemann surface of genus g , @xmath119 is an associated theta - function ( @xmath120 , e(x , y ) is a prime form , @xmath121 is a basis of holomorphic one - forms on x , @xmath122 is a universal covering of x and arbitrary @xmath123 .",
    "the fay s trisecant formula is [ 15 ]                                                      thus , the fay s trisecant formula for theta - function of any riemann surface is nothing but the associativity condition for the structure constants of the algebra ( 12 ) with parametrization ( 47 ) .",
    "the latter is a consequence of deformation equations ( 33 ) .",
    "we emphasize also that the collinearity of the points @xmath145 is equivalent to the associativity condition .                      in the papers [ 17 - 21 ]",
    "is was shown that the existence of a family of trisecants or even only one trisecant characterize jacobian varieties among indecomposable principally polarized abelian varieties ( ppavs ) .",
    "the results of the proposition 3 make it quite natural to * conjecture * that the existence of the associative three - dimensional algebra ( 12 ) , ( 28 ) for ppav such that on the corresponding line bundle equations ( 48 ) are valid with shifts @xmath130 defined by ( 44 ) is characteristic one for jacobian varieties .",
    "equations ( 46 ) , ( 48 ) , ( 49 ) can be treated as discrete equations of one takes theta function and function @xmath39 of the form @xmath152 and @xmath153  ( see e.g. [ 14 ] for the theta - function solutions of the hirota - miwa equation ( 35 ) ) .",
    "these equations admit different reductions .",
    "for instance , if one frozes the dependence on @xmath154 then under the constraint @xmath155 @xmath156 where fixed @xmath157 and @xmath158 are constants the first equation ( 48 ) coincides with equation ( 1.14 ) ( together with ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) ) from the paper [ 21 ] which is necessary and sufficient condition for ppav to be jacobian of a smooth curve of genus g. this fact supports the * conjecture * formulated above ."
