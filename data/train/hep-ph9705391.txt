    "one prediction of the weakly coupled heterotic string is the tree level gauge coupling unification at @xmath9 gev @xcite , where @xmath10 is the gauge coupling at the string scale .",
    "@xmath11 is the only mass scale that appears in the effective lagrangian of such string vacua , and thus is one mass scale naturally provided by string theory .",
    "however , one of the major obstacles to connecting string theory to the low energy world is the absence of a fully satisfactory scenario for supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , either at the level of world - sheet dynamics or at the level of the effective theory .",
    "the susy breaking induces soft mass parameters which provide another scale in the theory that can hopefully provide a link between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , in models with radiative breaking one of the higgs mass - squares runs from an initial positive value @xmath13 at @xmath11 to a negative value , of @xmath14 , at low energies , so that the electroweak scale is set by the soft supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath15 ( and not by the intermediate scale at which the mass - square goes through zero ) .    in spite of this difficulty , string theory does provide certain generic and , for a certain class of string vacua , definite predictions . with the assumption of soft supersymmetry breaking masses as free parameters , the features of the string models , such as the explicitly calculable structure of the superpotential , provide specific predictions for the low energy physics .",
    "for example , one can restrict the analysis to a set of string vacua which have @xmath16 supersymmetry , the standard model ( sm ) gauge group as a part of the gauge structure , and a particle content that includes three sm families and at least two sm higgs doublets , _",
    "i.e. _ , the string vacua which have at least the ingredients of the mssm and thus the potential to be realistic .",
    "such vacua often predict an additional nonanomalous @xmath5 gauge symmetry in the observable sector .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that for this class of string vacua with an additional @xmath5 broken by a single standard model singlet @xmath17 , the mass scale of the @xmath5 breaking should be in the electroweak range ( and not larger than a tev ) .",
    "that is , if the @xmath5 is not broken at a large scale through string dynamics , the @xmath5 breaking may be radiative if there are yukawa couplings of @xmath3 of @xmath17 to exotic particles .",
    "the scale of the symmetry breaking is then set by the soft supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath15 , in analogy to the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry described above .",
    "recently , a model was considered @xcite in which the two sm higgs doublets couple to the sm singlet , and the gauge symmetry breaking scenarios and mass spectrum were analyzed in detail .",
    "a major conclusion of this analysis was that a large class of string models not only predicts the existence of additional gauge bosons and exotic matter particles , but can often ensure that their masses are in the electroweak range . depending on the values of the assumed soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at @xmath11",
    ", each specific model leads to calculable predictions , which can satisfy the phenomenological bounds .",
    "in addition , the model considered in @xcite forbids an elementary @xmath8 term for appropriate @xmath5 charges , but an effective @xmath8 is generated by the electroweak scale vev of the singlet , thus providing a natural solution to the @xmath8 problem .",
    "however , the qualitative picture changes if there are couplings in the renormalizable superpotential of exotic particles to two or more mirrorlike singlets @xmath0 charged under the @xmath5 . in this case , the potential may have @xmath7 and @xmath6-flat directions , along which it consists only of the quadratic mass terms due to the soft supersymmetry breaking mass squared parameters @xmath1 . if there is a mechanism to drive the linear combination @xmath18 that is relevant along the flat directions negative at @xmath19 , the @xmath5 breaking is at an intermediate scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if some individual @xmath1 are negative but @xmath18 remains positive , then the @xmath7-flat direction is not relevant and the breaking occurs near the electroweak scale , similar to the case of only one singlet .    a large number of string models have the ingredients that can lead to such scenarios :    * sm singlets @xmath0 which do not have renormalizable self - interactions of the superpotential ( @xmath6-flatness ) . *",
    "if such singlets @xmath0 are charged under additional nonanomalous @xmath5 factors , more than one @xmath0 with opposite relative signs for the additional @xmath5 charges may ensure @xmath7-flat directions .",
    "this is the case that we focus on in this paper .",
    "however , similar considerations hold for a single scalar @xmath17 which carries no gauge quantum numbers and therefore has no @xmath7-terms . * most importantly , in a large class of models such @xmath0 can couple to additional exotic particles via yukawa couplings of @xmath3 .",
    "such yukawa couplings can then lead to radiative breaking , by driving some or all of the soft @xmath1 parameters negative at @xmath20 .    in the case of pure radiative breaking",
    ", the minimum of the potential occurs near the scale @xmath2 , and so the nonzero vev of @xmath0 s is at an intermediate scale . in principle , non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential compete with the radiative breaking .",
    "these terms are generically present in most string models .",
    "if such terms dominate at scales below @xmath2 , they will determine the vev of @xmath0 .",
    "in this case , the order of magnitude of the vev depends on the order of the non - renormalizable terms , but is also at an intermediate scale .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of intermediate scales in a class of string models .",
    "intermediate scales are of importance , as they are often utilized in phenomenological models ( e.g. , for neutrino masses ) , and may also have important cosmological implications ( e.g. , in the inflationary scenarios @xcite ) . in this paper , we also investigate the implications of intermediate scales for the standard model sector of the theory , specifically for the @xmath8 parameter , ordinary fermion masses , and majorana and dirac neutrino masses .    in section",
    "ii , we give a general discussion of radiative breaking along a flat direction and study two different mechanisms ( radiative corrections and non - renormalizable terms ) that stabilize the potential and fix an intermediate scale vev .",
    "we also examine the implications for the low energy particle spectrum of such type of scenarios .    in section iii",
    ", we explore the range of @xmath21 that can arise assuming that the flat direction has large yukawa couplings to exotic fields ( as is typically expected in string models ) @xcite .",
    "we consider three different models , with varied quantum numbers for the exotic fields , and in each case we examine the effect on @xmath2 of different choices of boundary conditions for the soft masses .",
    "the relevant renormalization group equations , with exact analytic solutions and useful simplified approximations are given in appendix  a.    in section iv , we discuss the size and structure of non - renormalizable contributions @xcite to the superpotential expected in string models @xcite .",
    "these terms are relevant to fix the intermediate scale and can also play an important role in connection with the physics of the effective low - energy theory .",
    "in particular , in section  v we study how these contributions may offer a natural solution to the @xmath8 problem and generate a hierarchy of standard model ordinary fermion masses in rough agreement with observation . we also indicate that interesting neutrino masses can arise from such terms . both the ordinary seesaw mechanism for majorana masses , or naturally small (",
    "non - seesaw ) dirac or majorana masses can be generated .    finally , in section vi we draw some conclusions .",
    "a well known mechanism to generate intermediate scale vevs in supersymmetric theories utilizes the flat directions generically present in these models @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this section applies to a general class of supersymmetric models with flat directions ; string models @xcite discussed subsequently in general possess these features .",
    "for example , consider a model with two chiral multiplets @xmath22 and @xmath23 that are singlets under the standard model gauge group , but carry charges @xmath24 and @xmath25 under an extra @xmath5 , i.e. , the @xmath5 belongs to the observable sector .",
    "thus , the mixing of the @xmath26 and @xmath5 gauge kinetic energy terms , which can arise due to the one - loop ( field theoretical ) corrections or genus - one corrections in string theory @xcite , can be neglected in the analysis of the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters . ] .",
    "if these charges have opposite signs ( @xmath27 ) , the scalar field direction @xmath17 with @xmath28 with @xmath29 is @xmath7-flat .",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not couple among themselves in the renormalizable superpotential the direction ( [ flatdir ] ) is also @xmath6-flat and the only contribution to the scalar potential along @xmath17 is given by the soft mass terms @xmath30 .",
    "if we concentrate on the ( real ) component @xmath31 along the flat direction : @xmath32 the potential is simply @xmath33 where @xmath34 which is evaluated at the scale @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 is positive at the string scale for some scalar field , depending on its modular weight @xcite . ]",
    "( @xmath36 if we assume universality . )",
    "however , @xmath18 can be driven to negative values at the electroweak scale if @xmath22 and/or @xmath23 have a large yukawa coupling to other fields in the superpotential goes negative but @xmath18 remains positive . in that case the @xmath7-flatness is not important : @xmath37 acquires an electroweak scale vev while @xmath38 , so that the @xmath5 is broken at or near the electroweak scale , similar to the case discussed in @xcite . ] . in this case , the potential develops a minimum along the flat direction and @xmath17 acquires a vev . from the minimization condition @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) one sees that the vev @xmath41 is determined by @xmath42 which is satisfied very close to the scale @xmath2 at which @xmath18 crosses zero .",
    "this scale is fixed by the renormalization group evolution of parameters from @xmath11 down to the electroweak scale and will lie at some intermediate scale .",
    "the precise value depends on the couplings of @xmath43 and the particle content of the model , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "the stabilization of the minimum along the flat direction can also be due to non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential , which lift the flat direction for sufficiently large values of @xmath44 .",
    "if these terms are important below the scale @xmath2 , they will determine @xmath45 .",
    "the relevant non - renormalizable terms are of the form , where @xmath46 is a standard model singlet that does not acquire a vev .",

    "for example , if @xmath52 , @xmath5 invariance dictates @xmath53 and only odd values of @xmath51 should be considered . if @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and so on .    including the @xmath6-term from ( [ nrsup ] ) ,",

    ", @xmath66 is evaluated at the scale @xmath67 and has to satisfy the necessary condition @xmath68 .",
    "if non - renormalizable terms are negligible below @xmath2 , no solution to ( [ vev ] ) exists and @xmath45 is fixed solely by the running @xmath18 .",
    "the mass @xmath69 of the physical field @xmath44 in the vacuum @xmath45 can be obtained easily in both types of breaking scenarios . in both cases",
    ", @xmath69 is of the soft breaking scale or smaller and not of the intermediate scale @xmath45 . for pure radiative breaking , @xmath70 in the last expression",
    "we give an order of magnitude estimate : the rg beta function for @xmath18 is the sum of several terms of order @xmath71 ( multiplied by some coupling constants ) , and part of the @xmath72 suppression can be compensated when all the terms are included .    in the case of stabilization by non - renormalizable terms , @xmath73    in the preceding discussion , we have ignored the presence of scalar fields other than @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the potential .",
    "in addition , there are extra degrees of freedom from the two singlets . the real field transverse to the flat direction eqn .",
    "( [ flatreal ] ) is forced to take a very small vev of order @xmath76 .",
    "the physical excitations along that transverse direction have ( up to soft mass corrections ) an intermediate scale mass @xmath77 the two pseudoscalar degrees of freedom i m @xmath37 , i m @xmath78 are massless : the potential is invariant under independent rotations of the phases of @xmath37 and @xmath78 so that the spontaneous breaking of this @xmath79 symmetry gives two goldstone bosons .",
    "one of the @xmath80 s is identified with the gauged @xmath5 and the corresponding goldstone boson is eaten by the @xmath81 , which has precisely the same intermediate mass given by eqn .",
    "( [ intmass ] ) .",
    "the other massless pseudoscalar remains in the physical spectrum and can acquire a mass if there are terms in the potential that break the other @xmath80 symmetry explicitly ( e.g. , in the presence of @xmath82 terms . ) .",
    "the fermionic part of the @xmath83 sector consists of three neutralinos @xmath84 .",
    "the combination @xmath85 is light , with mass of order @xmath86 if the minimum is fixed by non - renormalizable terms .",
    "if the minimum is instead determined by the running of @xmath18 , @xmath87 is massless at tree - level but acquires a mass at one - loop of order @xmath88 .",
    "the two other neutralinos have masses @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the @xmath5 soft gaugino mass .",
    "this pattern of masses can be easily understood ; in the absence of supersymmetry breaking , a nonzero vev along the flat direction breaks the @xmath5 gauge symmetry but leaves supersymmetry unbroken .",
    "thus , the resulting spectrum is arranged in supersymmetric multiplets : one massive vector multiplet ( consisting of the @xmath81 gauge vector boson , one real scalar and one dirac fermion ) has mass @xmath91 , and one chiral multiplet ( consisting of the complex scalar @xmath17 and its weyl fermion partner @xmath87 ) remains massless .",
    "the presence of soft supersymmetry breaking terms modifies the picture slightly , lifting the mass degeneracy of the components in a given multiplet by amounts proportional to the soft breaking .",
    "the rest of the fields that may be present in the model can be classified into two types ; those that couple directly in the renormalizable superpotential to @xmath43 will acquire intermediate scale masses , and those which do not can be kept light . in particular",
    ", all the usual mssm fields should belong to the latter class .",
    "the particle spectrum at the electroweak scale thus contains the usual mssm fields and one extra chiral multiplet @xmath92 remnant of the @xmath5 breaking along the flat direction and no additional @xmath5 there is also one extra chiral multiplet at the electroweak scale . ] .",
    "the interactions among the light multiplet @xmath93 and mssm fields are suppressed by powers of the intermediate scale . at the renormalizable level",
    ", the only interaction between the mssm fields and the intermediate scale fields arises from the @xmath5 @xmath7-terms in the scalar potential . the resulting effect after integrating out the fields which have heavy intermediate scale masses @xcite is a shift of the soft masses of mssm fields charged under the extra @xmath5 : @xmath94 the @xmath5 @xmath7-term contribution to the scalar quartic coupling of light fields charged under the @xmath5 drops out after decoupling these intermediate scale particles .",
    "non - renormalizable interactions between mssm fields and the @xmath95 fields , which can play an important role ( e.g. , for the generation of the @xmath8 parameter and fermion masses ) are discussed separately in section iv .    before closing this section , we remark in passing that a similar intermediate scale breaking can occur in the @xmath96 sector of the theory , where , in the absence of a fundamental @xmath8 parameter , the direction @xmath97 is also flat .",
    "the condition @xmath98 on the higgs soft masses would prevent the formation of such a dangerous intermediate scale minimum .",
    "this is however not a necessary condition ; the breaking could well occur first along the @xmath17 flat direction generating an effective @xmath8 parameter that can lift the @xmath99 flat direction .",
    "the determination of which breaking occurs first would require an analysis of the effective potential in the early universe .",
    "both mechanisms for fixing an intermediate vev ( purely radiative or by non - renormalizable terms ) depend on the scale @xmath21 at which some combination of squared soft masses is driven to negative values in the infrared . in this section",
    "we present several examples in which the breaking of the extra @xmath5 can take place naturally at an intermediate scale and examine the range of the scale @xmath2 .",

    "this problem can be resolved if there are other exotics which do not couple to @xmath37 but contribute to the running of the gauge couplings ( e.g. , additional @xmath104 doublets ; _ i.e. _ , model ( i ) is a limiting case of model ( ii ) as @xmath120 goes to zero ) .",
    "the additional exotics will generally have electroweak scale masses so they will not precisely cancel the effects of the triplets except by accident .",
    "however , model ( i ) is still useful to illustrate the basic ideas .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the boundary conditions for the yukawa couplings are given by @xmath121 as calculated in string models based on fermionic ( @xmath122 ) orbifold constructions at a special point in moduli space at the string scale is required if the three - gauge - boson coupling is to be @xmath123 . in this class of string models ,",
