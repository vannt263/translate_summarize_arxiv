    "eduard helly proved his classical theorem concerning convex subsets of euclidean spaces .",

    "this result gave rise to the concept of helly dimension .",
    "for a geodesic metric space @xmath8 we define its _ helly dimension _",
    "@xmath9 to be the smallest natural number such that any finite family of @xmath10-wise non - disjoint convex subsets of @xmath8 has a non - empty intersection .",
    "clearly , helly s theorem states that helly dimension of the euclidean space @xmath5 is @xmath11 .",
    "it is very easy to find examples showing that it is exactly equal to @xmath12 .",
    "mikhail gromov in @xcite gave a purely combinatorial characterization of @xmath13 cube complexes as simply connected cube complexes in which the links of vertices are simplicial flag complexes .",
    "there is a well known result for @xmath13 cube complexes which states that , regardless their topological dimension , they all have helly dimension equal to one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that in this case we additionally demand that convex subsets from the definition are convex subcomplexes .",
    "systolic complexes were introduced by tadeusz januszkiewicz and jacek witkowski in @xcite and independently by frederic haglund in @xcite .",
    "they are connected , simply connected simplicial complexes satisfying some additional local combinatorial condition ( see definition [ sysdef ] ) , which is a simplicial analogue of nonpositive curvature .",
    "systolic complexes inherit lots of @xmath13-like properties , however being systolic neither implies , nor is implied by nonpositive curvature of the complex equipped with the standard piecewise euclidean metric .",
    "one would expect for systolic complexes a similar kind of helly - like properties as for @xmath13 cube complexes .",
    "however , let us consider an example of a single @xmath14-dimensional simplex with its codimension @xmath1 faces being a family of convex subcomplexes .",

    "this example motivates the following modification of definition of helly dimension for systolic complexes .",
    "namely , we say that a systolic complex @xmath8 has helly dimension @xmath15 if for every @xmath16-wise family of non - disjoint convex subcomplexes there is a single simplex which has a nonempty intersection with all these subcomplexes .",
    "in this paper we prove that helly dimension of a systolic complex does not depend on its topological dimension .",
    "we obtained the following results :    ( see theorem [ tw7 ] in this text ) let @xmath8 be a @xmath0-systolic complex and let @xmath17 be pairwise intersecting convex subcomplexes .",
