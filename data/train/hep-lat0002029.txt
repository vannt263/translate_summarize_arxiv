    "anisotropic lattices allow us to carry out numerical simulations with the fine temporal resolution while keeping the spatial lattice spacing coarse , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are lattice spacing in the temporal and spatial directions , respectively .",
    "this is especially important for qcd monte carlo simulation at finite temperature and heavy particle spectroscopy .",
    "there have been many such calculations like glue thermodynamics@xcite , hadron masses at the finite temperature@xcite , glueballs@xcite and heavy quark spectra@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic lattice may become an important tool for the calculation of the transport coefficients of the quark gluon plasma@xcite and for the determination of spectral functions at finite temperature@xcite . in numerical simulations on the anisotropic lattice",
    "we need the information upon the renormalization of anisotropy which is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the renormalized anisotropy , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the bare one .",
    "karsch has first studied anisotropic lattices perturbatively with the standard plaquette action and obtained @xmath9 together with anisotropy coefficients which are defined by the derivatives of the spatial and temporal gauge couplings with respect to @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the qcd @xmath3 parameter @xcite . in ref.@xcite @xmath9",
    "was determined non - perturbatively by analyzing wilson loops in numerical simulations .",
    "anisotropic lattices play an essential role in the analysis of thermodynamics of qcd . to get the thermodynamics quantities like the internal energy and the pressure from numerical simulations",
    ", one needs to know the anisotropy coefficients .    on the anisotropic lattice",
    ", we can change the temperature by changing not only @xmath23 but also @xmath17 .",
    "this allows us to adjust the temperature continuously with fixed spatial volume .",
    "recently it has been recognized that improved actions are effective to get reliable results from lattice qcd simulations on the relatively coarse lattice ; lattice artifacts due to the discretization are expected to be much less .",
    "therefore , it is important to employ improved actions in the anisotropic lattice calculations , since the lattice is rather coarse in spatial direction in current numerical simulations .",
    "garca prez and van baal pursued first this direction , i.e. , they have determined the one - loop correction to the anisotropy for the square symanzik improved action@xcite .",
    "in this article we study the improved actions which consist of plaquette and six - link rectangular loops , @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the relation @xmath27 .",
    "this class of actions covers tree level symanzik action without the tadpole improvement ( @xmath28)@xcite , iwasaki action ( @xmath29 ) @xcite and dbw2 action ( @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "they are most widely used in simulations of recent days . for the class of actions which consists of planar loops the anisotropic lattice can be formulated in the same way as for the standard plaquette action .",
    "this may not be the case for improved actions which include non - planar loops in three or four dimensions .    in the following",
    ", we will calculate the @xmath3 parameter , @xmath31 and the anisotropy coefficients , in weak coupling regions mainly by perturbative calculations .    in sect .",
    "2 we briefly review the formulation of the anisotropic lattice with the improved actions and summarize formulae which will be used in this paper . in sect .",
    "3 , we outline the background field method and discuss the removal of the infrared divergence . in sect .",
    "4 we present results of the perturbative calculations .",
    "the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath9 and anisotropy coefficients are studied in detail . since the behavior of @xmath9 is very important for practical use , we will study it by the numerical simulations in sect .",
    "section 6 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in case of improved actions that consist of plaquette and rectangular loops , the anisotropic lattice may be formulated in the same way as for the standard plaquette action@xcite .",
    "the action takes the form    @xmath32    where @xmath33 are plaquette and six - link rectangular loop operators in @xmath34-@xmath35 plane , @xmath36 which are constructed of the link variable @xmath37 and @xmath38 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the coupling constants in the spatial and temporal directions , respectively .",
    "the action can be also written with the bare anisotropy parameter @xmath20 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the weak coupling limit of the anisotropic lattice is fully discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , we will summarize only equations which are necessary in the following studies .    in the continuum limit @xmath42 ,",
    "the lattice spacing and the coupling @xmath43 are related with each other by the scale parameter @xmath3 through the renormalization group relation , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the universal first two coefficients of @xmath47-function , @xmath48    we calculate the effective action using the background field method @xcite up to one - loop order , @xmath49 effective actions with different value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 correspond to different regularization scheme , but they should have the same continuum limit and we require @xmath50 .",
    "then the relations are obtained , @xmath51 @xmath52 in the following , the deviation of the one - loop quantum correction from the isotropic case is often employed and written as @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "perturbatively , all fundamental parameters on the anisotropic lattice are given in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter on the anisotropic lattice is given by @xmath57 the quantum correction for the anisotropy parameter @xmath4 is written as @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the quantum correction from the one - loop calculation .",

    "the background field method on the lattice is well known @xcite and therefore here we will only outline the method of the calculation and stress the points related to the anisotropic lattice .",
    "the gauge field is decomposed into a quantum field @xmath67 and a background one @xmath68 which satisfies the classical equation of motion , @xmath69 a gauge fixing term is introduced as , @xmath70 here @xmath71    the faddeev - popov term resulting from the gauge fixing is @xmath72.\\ ] ]    the total action becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gauge action constructed from plaquette and six - link rectangular loops .",
    "it is invariant under the following gauge transformation , @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an element of @xmath78 . for the calculation of the effective action in one - loop order",
    "we expand the total action up to second order in @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which we denote as @xmath81 . with the help of campbell - hausdorff s formula and a relation @xmath82 , we split the total action into a classical action and a bilinear term of @xmath67 and @xmath83",
    ", @xmath84 the term linear in @xmath80 is missing because of the equation of motion for the background field .",
    "thanks to the gauge invariance of the background field , it is sufficient to calculate the coefficients of @xmath85 to obtain the effective action .",
    "for the calculation of this term , we have applied the method explained in the appendix of ref.@xcite , which makes the calculation much simpler .",
    "it is convenient to separate the action @xmath81 into several parts , i.e. , @xmath86 . @xmath87 and @xmath88 are symbolically expressed as follows@xcite @xmath89\\\\     s_1^{'}:&&\\delta \\alpha[b,\\alpha]\\\\     s_2 : &     & [ \\alpha,\\alpha]w\\\\     s_3 : &     & [ b,\\alpha][b,\\alpha]\\\\     s_4 : &     & { \\it f}[b,[b,\\alpha]]\\\\     s_5 : &     & [ [ b,\\alpha],\\alpha]w\\\\     s_6 : &     & { \\it f}^2w^2\\\\     s_6^ { ' } : &     & \\alpha w[\\alpha , w],\\\\     \\end{array }     \\right.\\label{tenkai}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 represent @xmath80 and @xmath79 , respectively and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the field strength tensors of background and quantum fields , respectively .",
    "@xmath94 is a lattice derivative when we set @xmath95 in eq.([covad ] ) . @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the free part of the action , which defines gluon propagators .",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 terms correspond to three - point diagram from which we construct the one - loop self - energy .",
    "@xmath101 to @xmath88 contribute to the tadpole self - energy . here",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath99 result from gauge fixing terms .",
    "the faddeev - popov term is the same as the previous calculations except that the anisotropy parameter @xmath5 is included @xcite .      by the integration over the quantum fields , we obtain the effective action in one - loop order .",
    "we carry out the integration in the momentum space .",
    "fourier transform of the gauge and faddeev - popov fields are defined as @xmath102 @xmath103 we also define fourier transformation of the classical field in a similar manner .    by this fourier transformation , the anisotropy parameters are factorized in the action @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath104 @xmath105 are already given by iwasaki and sakai@xcite on the isotropic lattice and @xmath106 are defined as @xmath107 .",
    "\\label{xifactor}\\ ] ] in this way the perturbative calculation of the anisotropic lattice becomes very systematic and transparent .",
    "for example the free part of the anisotropic improved action @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 where the @xmath112 term in @xmath113 results from the gauge fixing term and @xmath114 stands for @xmath115 .",

    "the effective action is obtained by integrating @xmath124 over @xmath125 and faddeev - popov fields @xmath126 , @xmath127 then @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eq.([effeaction ] ) are obtained as coefficients of @xmath128 and @xmath129 in @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "we will discuss here a subtle point concerning the cancellation of the infrared divergence .",
    "the contributions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 from the self - energy type diagram of the term @xmath131 have the infrared divergence .",
    "however in the difference given by eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) they are canceled .",
    "but numerically the calculation of the divergent integral is very delicate problem . in the numerical evaluation ,",
    "we discretize the momentum integration @xmath132 , and the divergence comes from the segment including @xmath133 .",
    "we should not take the difference of integration with different @xmath5 directly , because their measures of segment are different for isotropic and anisotropic lattices .",
    "we use the following method for the calculation of the eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the coefficients with improved and standard actions , respectively .    in the first term of r.h.s of eq.([26 ] ) , @xmath137 and @xmath138 have the same infrared divergence and they are canceled exactly by each other .",
    "the second term of eq.([26 ] ) can be calculated by the analytic integration of the @xmath139 component of the loop momentum@xcite .",
    "the results do not include the infrared divergence and the numerical integration is stable .",
    "the divergence in the last term has been already calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have checked that our calculations for the second and the third terms of eq.([26 ] ) coincide with those for wilson and symanzik case respectively given in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "were not given in ref.@xcite , we have calculated them from table and formulae in ref.@xcite ]    in this way the difference @xmath140 is calculated in numerically stable manner .",
