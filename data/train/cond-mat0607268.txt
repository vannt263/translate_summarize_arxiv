    "in many natural phenomena we encounter propagating fronts separating different phases @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the autocatalytic reaction @xmath0 in a one dimensional lattice . models of this type have been studied actively because of several interesting features of the process @xcite .",
    "we can think of this reaction as a model for various spreading phenomena such as an epidemic : particle @xmath1 is an infectious agent which infects a healthy particle @xmath2 on contact .",
    "we are interested in finding the velocity of propgagation of this infection . the macroscopic description for this process is given by the following mean field equation @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the local density of @xmath1 particle at position @xmath9 and time @xmath10 , @xmath3 is its diffusion coefficient and @xmath11 is the reaction rate of the particle . in the second line",
    "we have used @xmath12 which is constant .",
    "equation ( [ e1 ] ) arises in the macroscopic description of diverse physical processes and serves as a generic model for front propagation in a system in which a stable state invades an unstable state @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ e1 ] ) allows a family of travelling wave solutions with speed @xmath13 invading the unstable state @xmath14 from the stable state @xmath15 .",
    "however , for steep enough initial conditions , the selected asymptotic speed is the minimum speed @xmath16 @xcite . in the microscopic lattice model in low dimensions ,",
    "the discreteness effects alter the dynamical properties of the propagating front and the results obtained are different from that using deterministic mean field equation @xcite@xcite . here , in this paper we will present the monte carlo simulation results and approximate analytic prediction for the front velocity in a one dimensional lattice model for @xmath0 defined in the next section ( ii ) .",
    "in our simulation , we start with a 1d lattice @xmath17 initially randomly filled with @xmath2 particles with overall concentration @xmath18 .",
    "we have taken hard core exclusion into account : any site can be occupied by maximum one particle . at the left end of the lattice we place an @xmath1 particle .",
    "we allow both the particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 to diffuse to the nearest neighbour empty sites with rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . when a sick particle @xmath1 encounters the healthy one @xmath2 sitting on a neighbouring site , then @xmath2 gets infected with rate @xmath11 and is converted to an @xmath1 particle . in this way",
    "the front ( rightmost @xmath1 ) propagates and we wish to find the velocity of this front .    in ref @xcite , authors studied a similar problem using smouluchowski approach @xcite and obtained the steady state density for @xmath2 and @xmath1 particles at a distance @xmath9 from the moving front particle ( at @xmath19 ) as : @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . by invoking the equality of particle fluxes to the left(@xmath22 ) and right[(@xmath23 they found @xmath15 , but it does not fix the front propagation velocity @xmath5 . in the present paper ,",
    "we try to find the expression for the front velocity by visualising the front as random walker moving with forward and backward rates as @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and thus speed of the front @xmath26 . in order to compute @xmath24",
    ", we notice that there are two ways in which the front will move to the right : ( 1 ) when the front diffuses to the right neighbouring site , provided it is empty with rate @xmath27 , here @xmath28 is the probability that the site just ahead of the front is occupied , ( 2 ) when the site just ahead of front is occupied by @xmath2 particle , then due to reaction it changes the neighbouring @xmath2 into @xmath1 and thus the front moves forward with rate @xmath29 and hence @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the front moves backward due to its diffusive move to the left empty neighbouring site and hence @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the probability that site just behind the front is occupied . using these values for @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ", we have for the asymptotic velocity , @xmath33 which is exact , given @xmath28 and @xmath32 .",
    "the multi - particle nature of the problem is embodied in finding @xmath28 and @xmath32 .",
    "the fact that equation ( [ e2 ] ) is exact can be seen from the excellent agreement between simulation result of @xmath5 and its estimate using values of @xmath28 and @xmath32 obtained directly from simulation , fig.([fig : vel_1 ] ) . here , we also observe a crossover from linear dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath3 for small @xmath3 to @xmath34 for large @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : vel_lnln ] ) , although we have verified that @xmath35(mean field value ) .     as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath36 .",
    "the broken line represents the front velocity obtained by simulation while the filled circles corresponds to the velocity obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) and substituting the values of @xmath28 and @xmath32 from simulation .",
    "inset : the differenece @xmath37 as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath32 taken directly from simulation . ]     for @xmath38",
    ". here @xmath39 and we notice a crossover from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . ]    from @xcite , the density profile of @xmath1 particles behind the front is constant and equal to @xmath18",
    ". thus we can make approximation @xmath42 .",
    "but we note that this approximation fails to work when @xmath43 where we get @xmath44 at all the sites behind the front irrespective of @xmath18 .",
    "thus the approximation @xmath42 works better for larger values of @xmath3 while for smaller @xmath3 it appears to be a poor approximation as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : vel_1 ] , inset ) . now using the approximation",
    "@xmath42 we try to find analytic expression for @xmath28 . in the following we find an approximate analytic expression for @xmath28 using the technique developed in @xcite .",
    "the technique involves writing a truncated master equation in a frame moving with the front ( i. e. the rightmost @xmath1 particle ) .",
    "for example , the simplest one is the set of two states @xmath45 . in this truncated representation each state contains the occupancy at two sites ( @xmath46 ) , the leftmost @xmath1 represents the front particle while @xmath47 and @xmath2 stand for empty and a site occupied by @xmath2 just ahead of the front respectively .",
    "these two states make transitions between each other due to reaction or diffusion of particles , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : moves ] ) .",
    "for example , in the transition shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : moves]a ) , the configuration @xmath48 changes to @xmath49 if @xmath1 particle diffuses to its left empty site and it takes place with rate @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : moves]b ) , diffusion of @xmath2 particle in the configuration @xmath48 to its right neighbouring empty site changes @xmath48 to @xmath49 . if the probability of occupancy of @xmath2 particle at a _",

    "( [ fig : moves]c ) , when @xmath1 infects @xmath2 in the configuration @xmath48 then @xmath52 if the second site ahead of the front is empty and this occurs with rate @xmath54 . similarly , in fig([fig :",
    "moves]d ) , @xmath49 changes to @xmath48 with rate @xmath55 . thus considering all the transitions between the two states @xmath49 and @xmath48 and approximating @xmath42 , the following master equation",
    "may be written @xcite : @xmath56     particles .",
    "( a ) diffusion of @xmath1 to the left empty site leading to transition from the state @xmath57 to @xmath58 , ( b ) diffusive jump of @xmath2 particle to its right empty site leading to transition from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , ( c ) transition from @xmath57 to @xmath58 due to reaction and ( d ) diffusion of @xmath2 to its left and thus making transition from @xmath58 to @xmath57.,width=288,height=192 ]    in the steady state , by definition , @xmath59 and thus from eq.([e3 ] ) with the normalization @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61    thus , in order to find @xmath28 we need to know @xmath51 and as a first approximation assuming @xmath62 , we find @xmath63 using this approximation for @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) we obtain the following expression for the velocity , @xmath64 we have shown the estimate for the velocity as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig : vel_2 ] ) . here",
    "we note that when @xmath65 , the above approximate result for @xmath5 satisfies the simulation result nicely .",
    "however , as the magnitude of @xmath66 increases the analytic prediction for @xmath5 departs gradually from the simulation results . from eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , we note that when @xmath67 the expression for @xmath5 is independent of @xmath28 and hence we obatain nice agreement between the theory and simulation results .",
    "but the dependece of @xmath5 on @xmath28 increases gradually with the inceasing magnitute of @xmath66 and hence we observe poor agreement between analytic and simulation results as we move away from the point @xmath67 . in order to get better prediction for the velocity , especially for larger values of @xmath66",
    ", we need to study the states having larger number of particles .",
    "for example , we studied the following set of states(@xmath68 ) : @xmath69 .",
    "if we denote the probability of occupancy at _ third _ site ahead of the front as @xmath70 , the evolution of these states is described by the following master equation . @xmath71 in order to solve the eqs .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) we need to know @xmath70 . to find the steady state solution of eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , and thus @xmath72 , one could approximate @xmath73 , as was done for @xmath46 case",
    ". however , a better estimate for @xmath70 can be obtained by writing a mean field equation for the densities @xmath51 and @xmath70 at second and third site ahead of the front , @xmath74 in steady state eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) gives , @xmath75 . now using the value of @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and approximating @xmath76 , we obtain the following approximate expression for @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath77 using this value of @xmath70 in eqs .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) , we obtain the steady state solution satisfying the normalisation @xmath78 .",
    "once we know these probabilities the density at site just ahead of the front is obtained as : @xmath79 . substituting this value of @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , we obtained an improved analytic estimates for the velocity as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : vel_2 ] ) . here",
    "we notice that as @xmath80 increases the data corresponding to the analytic estimate comes closer to the simulation result . in this approach",
    "one can systematically improve upon the estimates for @xmath28 and thus @xmath5 by including states having successively larger number of particles .",
    "we have also observed that when @xmath3=0 , the front position @xmath9 grows with time @xmath10 as @xmath81 as was reported in @xcite .",
    "hence , when @xmath43 , the asymptotic velocity @xmath5 approaches to zero .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) for @xmath43 , velocity is given as @xmath82 .",
    "the condition for zero velocity simply implies that @xmath83 . in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : den_profile ] ) , we have shown the simulation results for the density profile ahead of the front for different values of @xmath3 and notice that as @xmath84 0 , @xmath85 , which gives @xmath86 .",
    "we also note that when @xmath43 , @xmath1 particles form a compact cluster while @xmath2 particles keep on moving diffusively . the number of @xmath1 particles created during time interval @xmath87",
    ", @xmath88 should be equal to the number of consumed @xmath2 particles , @xmath89 .",
    "however , the equality @xmath90 holds for non zero @xmath5 only if @xmath91 while for @xmath92 , it gives @xmath93 .",
    "we also notice that when @xmath43 , the front dynamics is like a dla in @xmath94 , where , @xmath1 particles are static and growth occurs when @xmath2 particle diffuses and sticks with the neighbouring @xmath1 particle .     for @xmath95 . filled circle(@xmath96 ) represents analytic estimate for @xmath46 , that is , for states @xmath97 .",
    "filled square corresponds to the results obtained for @xmath68 , that is , for the states : @xmath98 while the open circle ( @xmath99 ) is the simulation results for the front velocity . here",

    "one can improve upon the results systematically by including states with successively larger number of sites in front of the leading @xmath1 particle .",
