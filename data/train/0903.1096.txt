    "the investigation of strongly interacting matter constitutes a major challenge in modern nuclear and particle physics . of particular interest are phase changes between hadronic and quark - gluon matter , similar to the one which is believed to have occurred in the early universe at a few microseconds after its birth .",
    "while the theory of the strong force is by now well established in terms of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite , two of its major manifestations in the world around us - the confinement of quarks and gluons and the generation of hadronic masses - are subject of vigorous contemporary research .",
    "both phenomena occur at energy - momentum scales of @xmath0 where the qcd coupling constant is rather large , @xmath1 , and therefore perturbation theory is not reliable and/or applicable . in a hot and dense medium at sufficiently large temperature ( @xmath2 ) and/or",
    "quark chemical potential ( @xmath3 ) , one expects the finite - size hadrons to be dissolved into a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) where the condensates underlying hadronic - mass generation have melted .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice - discretized qcd ( lqcd ) at finite temperature predict the phase change from hadronic to quark - gluon matter to occur at a `` pseudo - critical '' temperature of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this appears to be a rather small scale for a `` perturbative qgp '' ( pqgp ) of weakly interacting quarks and gluons to be realized , even though the computed energy density matches that of an ideal ( non - interacting and massless ) qgp within 20% or so for @xmath5 .    in the laboratory ,",
    "one hopes to create a qgp by colliding heavy atomic nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies , with a center - of - mass energy per colliding nucleon pair well above the nucleon rest mass , @xmath6 .",
    "if the energy deposition in the reaction zone is large enough , and if the interactions of the produced particles are strong enough , the notion of an interacting medium may be justified , despite its transient nature .",
    "this notion has been convincingly verified in nuclear collision experiments over the last @xmath7@xmath8 years at the super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern)@xcite and at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl)@xcite .",
    "transverse - momentum ( @xmath9 ) spectra of different hadron species in the low-@xmath9 regime ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) reveal that the produced medium explodes collectively reaching expansion velocities in excess of half the speed of light . in the high-@xmath9 regime ( @xmath12 ) , which in the heavy - ion environment became available at rhic for the first time ,",
    "hadron spectra are suppressed by up to a factor of @xmath7@xmath13 relative to @xmath14-@xmath14 collisions , indicative for a strong absorption of high - energy partons traversing the medium@xcite .",
    "the inclusive production of charm - quark bound states ( @xmath15 mesons ) is suppressed by a factor of 3 - 5 at both sps and rhic , indicative for their dissolution in the medium ( possibly related to deconfinement)@xcite .",
    "a large excess of electromagnetic radiation ( photons and dileptons ) is observed , indicative for medium temperatures around @xmath16 and a `` melting '' of the @xmath17-meson resonance ( possibly related to hadronic mass de - generation)@xcite .",
    "a more differential analysis of hadron spectra in non - central au - au collisions at rhic reveals a large elliptic asymmetry of the collective flow ( `` elliptic flow '' ) : the spatial asymmetry of the initial nuclear overlap zone is converted into an opposite asymmetry in the final hadron @xmath9 spectra . within a hydrodynamic modeling of the exploding fireball this observation requires a rapid thermalization and a very small viscosity of the interacting medium@xcite",
    ". only then can spatial pressure gradients build up fast enough to facilitate an effective conversion into azimuthal asymmetries in the energy - momentum tensor of the system .",
    "the agreement of hydrodynamic predictions with elliptic - flow data at rhic led to the notion of an `` almost perfect liquid '' , with a ratio of viscosity to entropy density close to a conjectured lower bound of any quantum mechanical system@xcite .",
    "the microscopic mechanisms underlying these rather remarkable transport properties are yet to be determined . in this context ,",
    "heavy quarks ( charm and bottom , @xmath18=@xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and their bound states ( charmonia and bottomonia ) are recognized as particularly suitable probes of the medium produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics)@xcite@xmath21 is too short to render it a viable probe in urhics ; thus , heavy quarks will exclusively refer to charm and bottom in this article .",
    "strange quarks are in between the heavy- and light - quark limit , forming their own complex of valuable observables@xcite . ] . in the present article",
    "we will attempt to review the current status of the theory and phenomenology of this promise .",
    "let us first focus on the sector of individual heavy quarks ( open heavy flavor ) .",
    "the fact that their masses are well above the typical temperature of the system , @xmath22 , has at least three important implications :    * the ( hard ) @xmath23 production process is essentially restricted to primordial @xmath24-@xmath24 collisions@xcite , i.e. , re - interactions in the subsequently evolving medium are not expected to change the number of heavy quarks ( reminiscent of the `` factorization theorem '' of perturbative qcd@xcite ) ; this is borne out experimentally by a scaling of @xmath25 production , @xmath26 , with the number of binary @xmath24-@xmath24 collisions , @xmath27 , at different collision centralities@xcite . *",
    "the thermal relaxation time of heavy quarks ought to be larger than for light quarks , parameterically by a factor @xmath7@xmath28  5 - 20 . with a light - quark and gluon thermalization time of @xmath290.3 - 1fm/@xmath19 (",
    "as indirectly inferred from hydrodynamic modeling at rhic ) and an estimated qgp lifetime of @xmath30  5fm/@xmath19 in central au - au collisions , one expects @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) to be on the same order as ( significantly larger than ) @xmath33 .",
    "thus , charm ( and especially bottom ) quarks are not expected to reach thermal equilibrium , but their re - interactions should impart noticeable modifications on the initial momentum spectrum ( less pronounced for bottom ) . the final heavy - quark ( hq ) spectra may therefore encode a `` memory '' of the interaction history throughout the evolving fireball , by operating in between the limits of thermalization and free streaming . *",
    "the theoretical task of describing hq interactions is amenable to a diffusion treatment , i.e. , brownian motion of a heavy test particle in a bath of a light - particle fluid .",
    "nonrelativistically , the typical thermal momentum of a heavy quark is @xmath34 , and therefore much larger than the typical momentum transfer from the medium , @xmath35 .",
    "this allows to expand the boltzmann equation in momentum transfer to arrive at a fokker - planck description of hq diffusion in the qgp , which directly yields the pertinent transport coefficients as well .",
    "the above three points provide a well - defined framework to construct in - medium hq interactions in qcd matter and test them against observables in urhics ( quantitative comparisons additionally require to account for effects of hadronization of the quarks , as well as reinteractions in the hadronic medium ) .",
    "the fokker - planck approach is readily implemented for the case of _ elastic _",
    "@xmath36 scattering off partons in the medium ( @xmath37)@xcite . in the light - hadron sector , however , the large suppression of high-@xmath9 spectra is believed to be largely caused by _",
    "radiative _ energy loss of high - energy partons traversing the qgp , i.e. , medium - induced gluon radiation of type @xmath38@xcite . even in the low-@xmath9 regime ,",
    "perturbative @xmath39 scattering processes have been suggested to facilitate the rapid thermalization required by phenomenology ( albeit in connection with rather large coupling constants of @xmath40)@xcite",
    ". the situation could be quite different in the hq sector .",
    "in the low - momentum limit , gluon - bremsstrahlung of a heavy quark is suppressed@xcite and the dominant momentum - transfer reaction is elastic scattering@xcite .",
    "as is well known from classical electrodynamics , the radiative energy loss of a muon is suppressed relative to an electron by a mass ratio @xmath41 . in perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "it is currently an open question at what momentum scale radiative energy loss of a heavy quark takes over from the collisional one ( which , most likely , will depend on additional parameters such as temperature , path length , etc . ) .",
    "in fact , this may not even be a well - defined question since nonperturbative processes at moderate momentum transfers may supersede perturbative ones before the elastic part of the latter dominates over the radiative one .",
    "the relations between perturbative and nonperturbative interactions is one of the key issues to be addressed in this review .",
    "experimental signatures for the modifications of hq spectra in urhics are currently encoded in single - electron ( @xmath42 ) spectra associated with the semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons , @xmath43 .",
    "these measurements require a careful subtraction of all possible `` photonic '' sources of electrons , such as photon conversions in the detector material , dalitz decays of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , vector - meson decays , and others .",
    "the modifications of the `` non - photonic '' electron spectra ( associated with heavy - flavor decays ) in au - au collisions are then quantified by the standard nuclear modification factor , @xmath46 , and elliptic flow coefficient , @xmath47 .",
    "the available rhic data in semicentral and central au - au collisions at @xmath48 exhibit a substantial elliptic flow of up to @xmath49 and a large high-@xmath9 suppression down to @xmath50 , respectively@xcite .",
    "both values are quite comparable to those for light hadrons ( the pion @xmath51 reaches somewhat higher , to about 15% ) .",
    "radiative energy - loss models@xcite based on perturbative qcd can not explain the @xmath42 data .",
    "these data were , in fact , instrumental@xcite in reconsidering elastic scattering as a significant source of parton energy loss in the qgp@xcite . the combination of pqcd elastic and radiative scattering does not suffice either to reproduce the observed suppression once a realistic bottom component is accounted for in the electron spectra@xcite .",
    "elastic scattering based on nonperturbative interactions , as proposed in refs.@xcite , simultaneously accounts for the @xmath42 elliptic flow and suppression reasonably well@xcite .",
    "this has reinforced the hope that hq observables provide the promised precision tool to characterize transport properties of the `` strongly coupled qgp '' ( sqgp ) .",
    "e.g. , if a clear mass hierarchy in thermal relaxation times , @xmath52 ( as well as @xmath53 ) emerges from a quantitative analysis of urhic data , it would be suggestive for a universal behavior of light- and heavy - quark transport in the qgp .",
    "however , there is still a substantial way to go before such a program can be realized , as discussed below",
    ".    it should not be surprising if in - medium properties of open heavy flavor , especially at low momentum , are closely related to medium modifications of heavy quarkonia .",
    "the latter have a long history as `` probes '' of the qgp in heavy - ion collisions , especially as potential indicators of the deconfinement transition , cf .",
    "refs.@xcite for a broad up - to - date coverage of this topic .",
    "in particular , progress in finite - temperature lattice qcd@xcite has triggered vigorous reconsideration of the question whether quarkonia , especially their ground states , can survive in the qgp significantly above the critical temperature .",
    "these developments include the application of potential models at finite temperature , coupled with the hope that heavy - quark free energies as computed in thermal lqcd can serve as a model - independent input for the low - energy heavy - quark interaction .",
    "if charmonium binding indeed remains sufficiently strong in the qgp to support bound states up to rather high temperatures , it is conceivable that the underlying interaction is of a more general relevance and therefore also operative in heavy - light@xcite and maybe even light - light@xcite systems . especially in the former case , from the point of view of elastic ( on - shell ) scattering of a heavy quark in the medium ,",
    "the conditions for momentum transfer are comparable to the heavy - heavy interaction governing quarkonium properties .",
    "since low - momentum hq interactions determine their transport properties , one immediately recognizes an intimate relation between hq transport and in - medium quarkonia .",
    "these connections are also being exploited in the analysis of thermal lqcd computations of quarkonium correlation functions@xcite .",
    "in addition to the binding properties , the inelastic reaction rates of quarkonia with surrounding partons or hadrons are a key ingredient for a quantitative description of their spectral function in qcd matter ( also here  quasi - elastic \" scattering of thermal partons with a heavy quark inside the quarkonium bound states may play an important role , especially if the binding energy becomes small@xcite ) .",
    "a good control over all of these aspects is mandatory to utilize quarkonium properties as diagnostic tool in heavy - ion collisions and eventually deduce more general properties of the medium produced in these reactions . as in the open heavy - flavor sector",
    ", this has to be built on a solid knowledge of the space - time history of nuclear collisions , as well as of the initial conditions on quarkonium spectra .",
    "the latter aspect could be more involved than for single heavy quarks , since ( a ) measurements in @xmath14-@xmath54 collisions show that cold - nuclear - matter ( cnm ) effects from the incoming nuclei ( e.g. , the so - called nuclear absorption ) affect the primordial charmonium number significantly ( e.g. , with up to 60% suppression for @xmath15 at sps energies when extrapolated to central pb - pb collisions ) ; ( b ) the bound - state formation time introduces another rather long time scale ( soft energy scale ) which is easily of the order of ( or longer than ) the thermalization time of the medium ( at least for charmonia and excited bottomonia at rhic energies and higher ) .    charmonium suppression beyond the level of cnm effects has been established in semi-/central pb - pb and au - au collisions at sps@xcite and rhic@xcite , respectively .",
    "an intriguing finding is that the observed suppression pattern and magnitude is very comparable at sps and rhic , despite the different collision energies which lead to substantial variations in , e.g. , light - hadron observables ( most notably a factor @xmath7@xmath55 larger charged particle rapidity density and stronger collective phenomena at rhic ) .",
    "however , this `` degeneracy '' was predicted@xcite as a consequence of charmonium regeneration mechanisms@xcite : a stronger suppression in the hotter and denser medium at rhic is compensated by the coalescence of @xmath19 and @xmath56 quarks in the qgp and/or at hadronization ( the @xmath57 production cross section at rhic is about a factor of @xmath7100 larger than at sps energies ) .",
    "while an `` extra '' source of charmonia increases the complexity of pertinent observables in heavy - ion reactions , it also provides another , rather direct , connection between the open and hidden heavy - flavor sectors .",
    "obviously , the secondary yield from @xmath19-@xmath56 coalescence necessarily carries imprints of the charm - quark distributions , both in its magnitude ( softer @xmath19-quark spectra are expected to result in larger coalescence probabilities ) and in its momentum spectra ( including elliptic flow ) . a comprehensive theoretical and phenomenological analysis of open and hidden heavy flavor is thus becoming an increasingly pressing and challenging issue .",
    "as a final remark on quarkonia in this introduction , we point out that bottomonium production in heavy - ion reactions is less likely to receive regeneration contributions ( at least at rhic and possibly neither at lhc ) . in addition , the increase in bottomonium binding energies ( compared to charmonia ) render them rather sensitive probes of color screening which strongly influences its dissociation rates@xcite .",
    "bottomonia thus remain a promising observable to realize the originally envisaged `` spectral analysis of strongly interacting matter''@xcite .",

    "[ sec_concl ] we recollect the main points of this article and conclude .",
    "at an energy scale of the ( pseudo- ) critical qcd transition temperature , the large charm- and bottom - quark masses imply that the hq diffusion problem is a nonrelativistic one ( unless initial conditions bring in an additional large scale ) . in the weak - coupling regime",
    "this further implies that the dominant interactions of the heavy quark are elastic scattering ( gluon radiation is suppressed by an extra power in @xmath60 and can not be compensated by a large momentum transfer as could be the case for a fast quark ; see , e.g. , the discussion in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that the perturbative expansion of the charm - quark diffusion coefficient , evaluated using thermal field theory , is not well convergent even for a strong coupling constant as low as @xmath61@xcite .",
    "thus , non - perturbative methods , e.g. , resummations of large contributions or interactions beyond perturbation theory , are necessary to improve the estimates of hq diffusion .",
    "this is not surprising since transport coefficients usually involve the zero - momentum limit of correlation functions rendering them susceptible to threshold effects which may increase with the mass of the particles .",
    "a simple example of such kind are coulomb - like bound states ( e.g. , heavy quarkonia ) , where the binding energy increases with increasing hq mass , @xmath62 , to be compared to thermal effects , e.g. , at a scale @xmath7@xmath63 for debye screening ( to leading order in @xmath64 ) or at @xmath7@xmath2 for inelastic dissociation reactions with thermal partons .",
    "an interesting question in this context is whether potential models are a viable means to evaluate hq interactions in the qgp .",
    "if a suitable formulation of a potential at finite temperature can be established , a promising opportunity arises by extracting these from first principle lattice computations of the hq free energy . in the heavy - quarkonium sector",
    "such a program has been initiated a few years ago@xcite with fair success , although several open questions remain@xcite . if applicable , potential models have the great benefit of allowing for nonperturbative solutions utilizing schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equations ; the calculated scattering amplitudes can then be straightforwardly related to transport coefficients . a key issue in this discussion is the transition to the ( ultra- ) relativistic regime , which becomes inevitable in applications to experiment toward high momentum . while relativistic kinematics can be readily accounted for",
    ", the opening of inelastic ( radiative ) channels poses major problems .",
    "however , here the contact to perturbative calculations may be possible and provide a valuable interface to match the different regimes , at least parametrically ( e.g. , in the limit of a small coupling constant and/or high temperature ) .",
    "this reiterates the importance of identifying the common grounds of seemingly different calculations for hq properties in medium .",

    "thus , the latter does not possess a breaking of scale invariance , a running coupling constant , confinement nor spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , and consequently no notion of a critical temperature , either .",
    "thus sym is quite different from qcd in the zero- and low - temperature regimes .",
    "however , at sufficiently high @xmath2 , where the qcd medium deconfines its fundamental charges , the resemblance to sym might be much closer .",
    "e.g. , the pressure in sym in the strong coupling limit amounts to about @xmath313 of the stefan - boltzmann limit , close to what is found in thermal lattice qcd for a wide range above @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , the finding of an extremely small shear viscosity in strongly coupled sym , @xmath314 ( conjectured to be a universal lower bound)@xcite , and the apparently low - viscosity qcd medium deduced from the success of hydrodynamic models at rhic , is another good reason to further pursue exact nonperturbative calculations in sym for quantities that are relevant for rhic phenomenology . if nonperturbative effects in the strongly coupled qgp at moderate temperatures , @xmath315-@xmath316 , are ultimately connected to the presence of the phase change(s ) ( and thus inherently to the critical temperature as a relevant scale ) , the cft - qcd connection would not be a rigorous one . but even in this case , the nonperturbative computation of transport coefficients of a strongly coupled system at a given reference temperature `` not too close '' to @xmath65 should provide useful insights .",

    "this leads to significantly smaller values for @xmath326 ( by a factor of 3 - 6 ) than the naive identification with @xmath333 . in connection with the redefined temperature , the improved ads / cft - based estimate for the hq friction coefficient in qcd amounts to @xmath334-@xmath335 at @xmath336 , which is significantly smaller than the `` naive '' estimate of @xmath7@xmath337 .      in view of the recent proliferation of seemingly different approaches to evaluate hq transport coefficients in the qgp it becomes mandatory to ask to",

    "the collisional dissociation mechanism involves the cornell potential for the @xmath114- and @xmath193-meson wave functions and thus incorporates a coulomb interaction as well ; the emphasis in this approach is on formation - time effects essentially caused by the different ( free ) binding energies of @xmath114 and @xmath193 mesons .",
    "in addition , the confining part of the cornell potential may play a role ( as in the @xmath2-matrix approach ) .",

    "a more involved issue is to scrutinize the underlying approximation schemes and their applicability .",
    "e.g. , perturbative approaches with large ( running ) coupling constants have poor ( if any ) control over higher - order corrections . as usual in such situations , diagrams with large contributions should be identified and resummed ( which is , of course , a non - trivial task , e.g. , maintaining gauge invariance ) ; it would be illuminating to extract a static gluon - exchange ( coulomb ) potential for a given set of parameters .",

    "nonperturbative approaches have been put forward which can , in principle , overcome this problem by a ( partial ) resummation of large contributions .",

    ", the comparison of calculated spectral functions to euclidean correlation functions computed in lattice qcd suggests that scenarios with either strong binding and rather large in - medium hq mass , or weak binding and smaller hq mass , are both viable . on the contrary ,",
    "inelastic reaction rates are rather sensitive to the binding energy and thus to the strength of color - debye screening , especially for bottomonia .",
    "this translates into a promising discrimination power of bottomonium suppression measurements at rhic and lhc .",
    "the phenomenology of charmonia is presumably more involved ; e.g. , kinetic rate - equation calculations for @xmath15 production in central au - au collisions at rhic indicate that the number of surviving primordial @xmath15 s is comparable to the number of secondary produced ones via @xmath19-@xmath56 coalescence in the qgp ( and/or at hadronization ) .",
    "such an interpretation is consistent with @xmath15 @xmath9 spectra where the coalescence yield is concentrated at low @xmath9 , thus reducing the average @xmath790 compared to primordial production .",
    "kinetic approaches furthermore suggest that regeneration is subleading at the sps , and that the observed suppression occurs at energy densities above the critical one .",
    "deeper insights will follow when advanced theoretical models meet future precision data , including rapidity dependencies , elliptic flow , excited charmonia and much needed constraints from d - au collisions at rhic ( to pin down cold - nuclear matter effects )",
