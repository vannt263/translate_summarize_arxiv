    "one of the main applications of this technology in matouek s book was a proof for brny s `` topological tverberg conjecture '' on @xmath4-fold intersections in the case when @xmath4 is a prime , originally due to imre brny , senya shlosman and andrs szcs @xcite .",
    "this conjecture claimed that for any continuous map @xmath6 , when @xmath3 , there are @xmath4 points in disjoint faces of the simplex  @xmath1 that @xmath7 maps to the same point in @xmath2 .",
    "the topological tverberg conjecture was extended to the case when @xmath4 is a prime power by murad zaydin in an unpublished paper from 1987 @xcite .",
    "this can not , however , be achieved via the dold theorem , since in the prime power case the group actions one could use on the codomain are not free .",

    "zaydin in 1987 had not only proven the topological tverberg theorem for prime power @xmath4 , but he had also shown , using equivariant obstruction theory , that the approach fails when @xmath4 is not a prime power : in this case the equivariant map one looks for does exist .    in a spectacular recent development ,",
    "isaac mabillard and uli wagner @xcite @xcite have developed an @xmath4-fold version of the classical `` whitney trick '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which yields the failure of the generalized van kampen  flores theorem when @xmath8 is not a prime power .",
    "then florian frick observed that this indeed implies the existence of counterexamples to the topological tverberg conjecture @xcite @xcite by a lemma of gromov @xcite that is an instance of the constraint method of blagojevi , frick , ziegler ( * ? ? ?",

    "( see @xcite for a popular rendition of the story . )    the tverberg theorem from 1966 @xcite and its conjectured extension to continuous maps ( the topological tverberg conjecture ) have seen a great number of variations and extensions , among them `` colored '' variants as well as versions with restricted dimensions ( known as generalized van kampen ",
    "flores theorems ) .",
    "although many of these were first obtained as independent results , sometimes with very similar proof patterns , our presentation shows that there are many easy implications between these results , using in particular the `` constraint method '' applied to `` unavoidable complexes , '' as developed by the present authors with florian frick @xcite .",

    "next we define a continuous @xmath67-equivariant map from a @xmath13-sphere to @xmath26 . for this we do not use the standard @xmath13-sphere , but the unit sphere @xmath69 in the hyperplane @xmath70 , that is , @xmath71 this representation of the @xmath13-sphere also has the standard antipodal @xmath67-action .",
    "the map @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",

    "now the topological radon theorem can be applied to the continuous map @xmath84 .",

    "the dimension of the simplex in the theorem is optimal , it can not be decreased . to see this",
