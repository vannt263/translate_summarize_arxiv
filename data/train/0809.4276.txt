    "in quantum information theory and quantum computations , entanglement is recognized as an essential resource for quantum processing and quantum communications , and it is believed that the protocols based on the entangled states have an exponential speed - up than the classical ones . besides , in highly correlated states in condensed matter systems such as superconductors@xcite , fractional quantum hall liquids @xcite , the entanglement serves as a unique measure of quantum correlations between degrees of freedom . in quantum many - body systems such as spin , fermion and boson systems ,",
    "the entanglement is connected to the phase diagram of the physical systems .",
    "non - analytic behavior of entanglement close to the quantum critical point of the system and occurrence of finite size scaling have provided an intense research leading to fresh our insight of the critical properties from the quantum information side , for a comprehensive discussion see the review by l. amico , _",
    "et al_. @xcite and references therein . in the past years",
    "the appearance of new phases of matter has intensified the investigation of the entanglement in the quantum systems .",
    "these are phases beyond the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm @xcite where an appropriate local order parameter characterizes different behaviors of two phases on either side of the critical point .",
    "these new phases of matter carries a kind of quantum order called _ _ topological order__@xcite and the transition among various phases does not depend on the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "therefore the landau theory of classical phase transition fails in order to describe these phases .",
    "ground state of such phases is a highly entangled state and the excitations above the ground state have a topological nature which mirrored in their exotic statistics .    among the models with topological properties ,",
    "the kitaev or toric code@xcite has been extensively studied .",
    "ground state degeneracy depends on the genus or handles of the manifold where the model is defined on , and there is a gap which separated the ground state subspace from the excited states .",
    "the ground state degeneracy can not be lifted by any local perturbations which underlines the kitaev s model as a testground for fault - tolerant quantum computations @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the kitaev s model is indeed stabilized by group generated by a set of local operators called _ plaquette _ and _ star _ operators making it useful as a quantum error correcting code@xcite .",
    "the information is encoded in the ground state subspace which is topologically protected making it robust as a quantum memory @xcite . for this model",
    "any bipartition of the lattice has non - zero entanglement which manifests the ground state is generically multipartite entangled@xcite .",
    "bipartite entanglement scales with the boundary of the subsystem showing that the entanglement between two parts of the system depend only on the degrees of freedom living on the boundary which is a manifestation of the holographic character of the entanglement entropy@xcite .",
    "+ for topological models a satisfactory connection between topological order and entanglement content of a model has been established via introducing the concept of the _ _ topological entanglement entropy ( tee)__@xcite which is a universal quantity with topological nature . + another resource with topological protection character is called _ color code_. an interplay between color and homology provides some essential features , for example a particular class of two - dimensional color codes with colored borders will suppress the need for selective addressing to qubits through implementation of clifford group@xcite.the number of logical qubits which are encoded by a two dimensional color code are twice than the toric code @xcitedefined on the compact surface .",
    "+ in this paper we study the entanglement properties of a color code defined on a two - dimensional lattice , the so called 2-colex @xcite .",
    "we consider different bipartitions of the lattice and evaluate the entanglement entropy between them .",
    "the connection between the topological nature of the code and the entanglement entropy is also discussed . + the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec(ii )",
    "the basic notions of a color code on the surface has been introduced . in sec(iii ) based on the stabilizer structure of the protected code space the reduced density matrix which is needed for evaluating the entanglement entropy has been calculated .",
    "then in sec(iv ) the entanglement entropy for different bipartitions is calculated . in sec(v )",
    "another class of color code on plane and its entanglement properties are introduced , and the final section ( vi ) has been devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this paper we consider a class of topological quantum error - correction code defined on the lattice , the so called topological color codes ( tcc)@xcite . the local degrees of freedom are spin-@xmath0 with the bases of the hilbert space _ @xmath1_. the lattice we consider composed of vertices , links and plaquettes .",
    "each vertex stands for a local spin .",
    "three links meet each other at a vertex and no two plaquettes with same color share the same link .",
    "we suppose this color structure is denoted by the notation tcc\\{_v_,_e_,_p _ } where the _ v_,_e_,_p _ denote the set of vertices , edges and plaquettes , respectively .",
    "for simplicity we define the model on the regular hexagonal lattice on the torus , i.e imposing periodic boundary conditions as shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "there is a subspace @xmath2 which is topologically protected .",
    "the full structure of this subspace and its properties are determined by definition of stabilizer group .",
    "the stabilizer group is generated by a set of plaquette operators .",
    "for each plaquette we attach the following operators which are product of a set of pauli operators of vertices around a plaquette : [ eq1 ] ^c_p=_vp^c_v  ;   = _ _ x _ _ , _ z _   ,  c= , ,",
    ".    for a generic plaquette , say blue plaquette @xmath3 in fig.([fig1 ] ) we can identify green and red strings which are the boundary of the plaquette .",
    "it is natural to think of product of different plaquette operators which may produce a collection of boundary operators .",
    "for example as is shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) the product of two neighboring plaquettes , say red and blue ones , correspond to a green string @xmath4 which is a boundary of two plaquettes .",
    "all string operators produced in this way are closed .",
    "since all closed strings share either nothing or even number of vertices , they commute with each other and with plaquettes .",
    "in addition to closed boundary operators , there are other closed string which are no longer the product of the plaquette operators . these closed string form the fundamental cycles of the manifold in which the lattice is defined on and have a character of color .",
    "number of these closed loops depends on the genus of the manifold where the lattice defined on . for the torus with @xmath5",
    "there are two such cycles which are non - contractible loops in contrary to the closed boundary strings which are homotopic to the boundary of a plaquette . for the topological color codes",
    "these non - contractible loops are shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "for every homology class of the torus there are two closed strings each of one color , say red and blue .",
    "red string connects red plaquettes and so on .",
    "note that a generic string , say green , can be produced by product of the red and blue strings when they are suitably chosen .",
    "in fact since every pauli matrix squares identity , at a vertex ( qubit ) which two homologous strings cross each other they cancel each other .",
    "indeed there is an interplay between color and homology class of the model .",
    "one can define a nontrivial closed string as follows : [ eq2 ] ^c_=_ii_i , where _",
    "i _ indexed the set of spins on a generic string , @xmath6 stands for the homology class of the torus and @xmath7 is the @xmath8 or @xmath9 pauli spin operators .",
    "closed non - contractible loops turn on to form bases for the encoded logical operators of topological code .",
    "to more clarify this , we label different loops as :    x_1^rx_2  , x_2^bx_1  , x_3^bx_2  , x_4^rx_1 ,    [ eq3 ] z_1^bz_1  , z_2^rz_2  , z_3^rz_1  , z_4^bz_2  .",
    "these operators form a 4-qubit algebra in @xmath10 , so it manifests a 16-dimensional subspace for the coding space @xmath11 which is topologically protected . on the other hand , the topological color code on the torus with @xmath5 encodes four qubits .",
    "now we move to construct the explicit form of the states of the subspace @xmath11 .",
    "+ the above construction for the string operators in eq.([eq3 ] ) can be extended to an arbitrary manifold with genus @xmath12 .",
    "for such manifold the coding space spanned with @xmath13 vectors . note that for toric code ( white and dark code)@xcite when is embedded in the same manifold with genus @xmath12 , the coding space will span with @xmath14 vectors@xcite which explicitly shows that the color codes have richer structure than the toric codes@xcite .",
    ", say blue , can be denoted by either red or green closed boundary string and the product of two neighboring plaquettes , say red and blue , corresponds to a green string @xmath15 .",
    "non - contractible loops ( @xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 ) for topological color codes which determine the structure of the encoded subspace @xmath11 . a colored string connect plaquettes with the same color.,width=302 ]      the protected subspace @xmath11 is spanned by the state vectors which are stabilized by all element of stabilizer group , i.e. a subset of pauli group .",
    "let @xmath20 be a set of generators of the stabilizer group and its elements are denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "so this subspace is    [ eq4 ] = \\{|  :   |=|   }  .",
    "let @xmath22 be the group constructed by the generators of spin - flip plaquette operators , i.e @xmath23 .",
    "the cardinality of the group is then @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the total number of plaquettes .",
    "note that all plaquettes are not independent since the product of all plaquettes with the same color represents the same action in the group , namely @xmath26 where @xmath27 , one can construct a state vector in the hilbert space which is stabilized by the group elements . this state vector is a superposition of all elements of the stabilizer group with equal weights . from the previous arguments , it is convenient to denote it by @xmath28 which has the following form [ eq5 ]    the stabilizing group , i.e @xmath29 where @xmath30 corresponds to the plaquette operator @xmath31 appearing ( not appearing ) in the element group @xmath32 .",
    "there are many elements of the pauli group that commute with the all elements of the stabilizer group but are not actually in @xmath22 , and it is defined as the centralizer of @xmath22 in pauli group . since elements of pauli group either commute or anticommute ,",
    "the centralizer is actually equal to the normalizer of @xmath22 in pauli group . considering the non - contractible loops ,",
    "the normalizer of stabilizer group can be obtained by product of stabilizer group and group of non - contractible loop operators .",
    "let denote it by @xmath33 where the group @xmath34 generated by non - contractible loop operators , i.e. [ eq6 ] = \\{^=2_=1,c = b , r(s^cx_)^r_c  ,  r_c=0,1 }  .",
    "so , the group @xmath35 reads [ eq7 ]     note that @xmath36 .",
    "the group @xmath35 is the normalizer of @xmath22 in pauli group , so the normal subgroup @xmath22 divides the group @xmath35 into @xmath13 cosets .",
    "the cardinality of group will be @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the protected subspace @xmath11 is spanned by @xmath13 states which correspond to different cosets .",
    "in fact , elements in @xmath38 take one encoded state of the stabilized subspace to another encoded state without leaving the stabilized subspace . for the states of the stabilized subspace we have , by construction :    [ eq8 ] = \\ {  |ijkl :  |ijkl = x^i_1x^j_2x^k_3x^l_4|0000  } , where @xmath39 are defined in eq.([eq3 ] ) and @xmath40 .",
    "these topological non - trivial string operators can take one state of the coding space to another one , and any error of this type will not be detectable . a generic state can be a superposition of different vectors of coding space as follows :    [ eq9 ] |=_i , j , k , la_i , j , k , l|ijkl  ,  _ i , j , k , l|a_i , j , k , l|^2=1  .      from the practical point of view",
    "it is important to find a state of quantum many - body system for implementation of universal quantum computation .",
    "we can provide a construction in which the protected subspace be the ground sate of a local hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the subspace @xmath11 is the ground state of a following exactly solvable hamiltonian , i.e.    [ eq10 ] h=-_p px_p-_p pz_p  .",
    "the ground state of this hamiltonian is @xmath13-fold degenerate and topologically protected from local errors .",
    "different states of the ground state subspace as it is clear from eq.([eq8 ] ) are obtained by product of non - contractible colored strings .",
    "each state is characterized by a set of topological numbers which are sum of all @xmath41 modula @xmath42 along non - contractible loops .",
    "for example for a generic state @xmath43 in eq.([eq8 ] ) the topological numbers are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where the summations are evaluated in mod @xmath42 , @xmath41 stands for the @xmath48-component of @xmath9-pauli matrix of vertex @xmath49 and @xmath50 identifies a set of vertices ( qubits ) on a closed non - contractible loop with homology @xmath6 and color @xmath51 .",
    "an excited state will arise when any of the stabilizing conditions in eq.([eq4 ] ) is violated . in the energy unit which is defined by hamiltonian eq.([eq10 ] ) , the first excited state will be separated from the ground state by a gap of value @xmath42 .",
    "in this section we turn on to calculate the entanglement properties of the topological color codes .",
    "we consider a generic bipartition of the system into subsystems @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be the number of plaquette operators acting solely on @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , and let @xmath56 to stand for the number of plaquette operators acting simultaneously on @xmath52 and @xmath53 , i.e these are boundary operators .",
    "we focus on the entanglement entropy between two partitions @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the system . to this end",
    ", first the reduced density operator of the one subsystem is evaluated and then the entanglement entropy is measured .",
    "if the state of the system is in an equal superposition of the elements of group _ g _ , the reduced density matrix for a subsystem , say _ a _ , has the following form @xcite    [ eq11 ] _",
    "a=_gg / g_b , g_ag_a|0_a_a0|g_a_awhere @xmath57 and @xmath58 are subgroups of @xmath22 which act trivially on subsystems _ b _ and _ a _ , respectively and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are their cardinality",
    ". so the von neumann entropy is    [ eq12 ] s_a=_2|g_ab|where @xmath61 .",
    "it is a simple task to show that all states of the coding space have the same entanglement entropy . to show this ,",
    "let @xmath62 in which @xmath63 is a binary vector .",
    "so , for a generic state in the coding space we have : @xmath64",
    ". moreover the string operators @xmath65 can be decomposed as @xmath66",
    ". therefore we obtain    [ eq12 ] _",
    "a(|t)=tr_b(|tt|)=tr_b(x(t)|00|x(t))=x(t)_atr_b(|00|)x(t)_a = x(t)_a_a(|0)x(t)_a  .",
    "this implies that , by using the ancilla @xmath67 $ ] , the entanglement entropy for a state @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "in this section we design different spin configurations as subsystems and then evaluate their entanglement with its complementary .      as first example",
    "we consider the entanglement between one spin and remaining ones of the lattice . in this case",
    "there is no closed boundary operators acting exclusively on the spin , i.e subsystem _",
    "a_. so the reduced density matrix @xmath70 is diagonal as follows :    [ eq13 ] _ a = f^-1_gg / g_bg_a|0_a_a0|g_a    where @xmath71 is the number of operators which act freely on the subsystem _ a_. as it is clear there are three plaquette operators which act freely on one spin since every spin in the color code is shared by the three plaquettes ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath72 .",
    "only half of operators of quotient group leading to flip the spin , i.e. they will have trivial effect unless three plaquettes act either individually or altogether .",
    "therefore the reduced density matrix is    [ eq14 ] _",
    "a= ( |1_a_a1|+|0_a_a0| ) .",
    "thus , in topological color code every spin is maximally entangled with other spins . for the surface code ( kitaev model )",
    "a single spin is also maximally entangled with other spins @xcite .",
    "we calculate the entanglement between two spins . for this case",
    "also there is not any closed boundary operator with nontrivial effect on two spins , so the reduced density matrix reads    [ eq15]_a=(|1111|+|1010|+|0101|+|0000| ) .",
    "the entanglement between two spins which is measured by the concurrence@xcite vanishes .",
    "while each spin is maximally entangled with others , two spins are not entangled which is a manifestation of the fact that the topological color code is genuinely multipartite entangled like the surface codes .      in this case",
    "we aim to know how much a closed colored spin chain winding the torus nontrivially , say blue or red in fig.([fig1 ] ) is entangled with rest of the lattice . for the sake of clarity and without loss of generality",
    "we consider a hexagonal lattice with @xmath73 plaquettes , where @xmath74 is an integer number as @xmath75 , for example in fig.([fig1 ] ) @xmath76 .",
    "this choice makes the color code more symmetric .",
    "so , the number of plaquettes with a specific color , say red , is @xmath77 , and the number of spins that the colored chain contains is @xmath78 .",
    "let the system be in the @xmath28 .",
    "for this state there is not any closed boundary which exclusively acts on the chain . therefor the reduce density matrix is diagonal and the number of plaquette operators which act independently on the subsystem _ b _ is [ eq16]_b=(|p|-2)-(32k)+(2k+1)where the third term is the number of constrains on the plaquette operators acting on spin chain .",
    "in fact these are collective operators , i.e product of boundary plaquette operators between _ a _ and _ _ b__which act solely on _",
    "b_. with these remarks in hand , the entanglement entropy becomes    [ eq17]s_a==4k-1  .",
    "it is instructive to compare the obtained entanglement entropy in eq.([eq17 ] ) with the entanglement of the spin chain in the kitaev s model .",
    "for the latter case when the model defined on the square lattice on a compact surface , i.e torus , there exists a rather similar scaling with the number of qubits living in the chain@xcite .    in both cases",
    "the entanglement entropy in eq.([eq17 ] ) can be understood from the fact that only configurations with even number of spin flips of the chain allow in the ground state structure .",
    "plaquettes which are free to act on the spin chain only able to flip even number of spins of the chain .",
    "the same arguments can be applied for other ground states @xmath43 where for all of them the entanglement entropy is given by eq.([eq17 ] ) . by inspection of other ground states",
    "we see that there are @xmath79 state in which even number of spins in the spin chain have been flipped .",
    "these states are        [ eq18 ] x_1x_4|0000  ,  x_3x_4|0000  ,  x_1x_3x_4|0000 .    besides , there are @xmath79 states with an odd number of spin flipped for the spin chain which have been listed below :    x_2|0000  ,  x_2x_1|0000  ,  x_2x_3|0000 ,    x_2x_4|0000  , x_2x_1x_3|0000  , x_2x_1x_4|0000 ,    [ eq19 ] x_2x_3x_4|0000  , x_2x_1x_3x_4|0000 .",
    "now we consider a generic state and calculate the entanglement entropy between the colored spin chain and rest of the lattice .",
    "the density matrix @xmath80 is [ eq20]=_ijkl , mnpqa_ijkl|a_mnpqx^i_1x^j_2x^k_3x^l_4_0x^m_1x^n_2x^p_3x^q_4 .    with the explanations we made above the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath70 for the even number of spin flipped is as follows : ( |a_0000|^2+|a_1000|^2+|a_0010|^2+|a_0001|^2+|a_1010|^2    [ eq21 ] + |a_1001|^2+|a_0011|^2+|a_1011|^2)=    where @xmath81 .",
    "note that the number of these eigenvalues is @xmath82 . through the similar arguments we see",
    "that the eigenvalues of reduced density matrix of the spin chain with odd number of spin flipped is @xmath83 and the number of these eigenvalues is @xmath82 .",
    "so , we can calculate the entanglement entropy as follows :    [ eq22]s_a=-^2 ^ 4k_i=1_i_i=-2 ^ 4k-1 - 2 ^ 4k-1(1-)((1-))=4k-1+h ( )    where @xmath84 .",
    "+ what about the entanglement of an open string ?",
    "the open strings in the color code stand for the errors and map the coding space into an orthogonal one .",
    "these open strings anticommute with plaquette operators which share in odd number of vertices . for an open string which contains @xmath85 qubits",

    "there is not any closed boundary operator acting solely on _",

    "we mean the spins on the @xmath16 and @xmath17 strings in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "the subsystem _ a _ contains @xmath88 spins and again there is no closed boundary acting on it . enumerating the independent plaquette operators acting on the subsystem _ b",

    "@xmath89 plaquettes act freely on subsystem @xmath52 , but there are some constraints on them which arise from the product of plaquettes in which leave the subsystem @xmath52 invariant and makes collective operator which acts solely on _ b_. the product of blue and green plaquettes of those plaquettes which are free to act on @xmath52 will produce a red string leaving @xmath52 invariant .",
    "the same product hold for the red and green plaquettes .",
    "so the entanglement entropy reads    [ eq24]s_a=8k-2  .indeed this is entanglement entropy for a green string .",
    "however , the number of spins it contains is twice than the strings we discussed in subsec(c ) .",
    "a set of vertical spin ladders has been shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) . in this subsection",
    "only one of them has been considered as subsystem @xmath52 .",
    "let the system be in the state @xmath28 . in this case the subsystem _ a _ contains @xmath90 spins , and the total number on independent plaquette acting on subsystem _ b _ is @xmath91 .",
    "since there are not any closed string acting solely on _ a _ , the entanglement entropy reads    [ eq25]s_a=6k  .",
    "so , it is clear that this spin ladder has maximum entanglement with the rest of the system and its state has the maximum mixing , namely    [ eq26]_a=2 ^ -6k_6k6k",
    ".      now we consider all vertical spin ladders has been depicted in fig.([fig2 ] ) and again we suppose the system is in the state @xmath28 .",
    "there is not any plaquette operator which acts solely on subsystem _",
    "a_. however , there are several specific product of plaquette operators producing closed strings in which act solely on _",
    "a_. for example the product of plaquettes which are in a vertical column will produce a closed string acting on one of the subsystems . both subsystems _ a _ and _ b _ are symmetric with respect to each other .",
    "so , the number of closed strings which act only on _ a _ and _ b _ will be @xmath92 .",
    "finally the entanglement entropy reads    [ eq27]s_a=12k^2 - 4k-2  .          in this case",
    "we adapt a situation in which a set of plaquettes intuitively forms a hexagon as shown in fig.([fig3 ] ) . in this figure",

    "now we can enumerate the number of plaquettes which act on @xmath52 in terms of @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 . the total number of spins of the subsystem _ a _ is @xmath95 .",
    "there are @xmath96 plaquettes which act between _ a _ and _ b_. let the system be in the state @xmath28",
    ". with these realizations of the subsystems and since @xmath97 we can turn on to calculate the entanglement entropy between two subsystems as follows :    [ eq28]s_a=_2 2^_ab-2=_ab-2=6n-2  .",

    "a convex shape will be @xmath99 where the coefficient @xmath100 is a nonuniversal constant depending on the shape of the region while the constant @xmath101 will be universal and has a topological nature .",

    "we can exploit this property of string operators in order to choose the strings appearing in eq.([eq31 ] ) in which they do not cross subsystem @xmath52 .",
    "indeed the strings @xmath110 act only on the subsystem @xmath53 , i.e @xmath111 .",
    "this leads to @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath40 .",
    "other cases will be zero . to clarify this ,",

    "otherwise the above expression will become zero .",
    "the fact @xmath118 explicitly implies that the operator @xmath119 must be a non - contractile strings which is impossible since it must act solely on @xmath52 .",
    "so we will leave with @xmath120 .",
    "the same arguments may also apply for other cases .",
    "finally the entanglement for a generic state of the system and a convex region will become    [ eq34 ] _ a = tr_b(_0 )  ,  s_a = a-2  .              as we see from the eq.([eq29 ] ) , in the entanglement entropy of a region there exists a subleading term which is universal and independent of the shape of region .",
    "this is a characteristic signature of topological order which has been found on the subleading term of the entanglement entropy . to be more precise on the topological character of subleading term",
    ", we can construct a set of bipartitions in which the boundary contribution is dropped and remaining term is stemmed from the topological nature of the code and inspires the topological order . to drop the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom",
    "we consider a set of partitions which have been shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "topological entanglement entropy then arises from the following combination of entanglement entropy [ eq35]s_topo=_r , r ( -s_1a+s_2a+s_3a - s_4a )  .    for each bipartition one can use the entanglement entropy as before , namely @xmath121 .",
    "so far the cardinalities @xmath59 and @xmath60 were determined by the number of plaquette operators acting solely on _ a _ and _ b _ , respectively , i.e. @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath55 and @xmath55 stand for the number of plaquette operators acting only on _ a _ and _ b _ , respectively . however , for calculating of the @xmath124 we should take into account other closed strings in addition to the above closed strings acting on subsystems . for the case in which each partition is a single connected region , for example bipartitions @xmath125 and @xmath126 in fig.([fig4 ] ) , the previous arguments work , but for disjoint regions such as @xmath127 and @xmath128 in fig.([fig4 ] ) we should extend the above result . as an example a simple case has been shown in fig.([fig5 ] ) where we have supposed the subsystem _ a _ is composed of two disjoint regions ( two dashed rectangles which we label them as @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) while the subsystem _ b _ is a single connected one . by inspection",
    "we see that the product of two set of plaquettes , say blue and green ones , which act on @xmath129 and the blue and green ones acting simultaneously on @xmath129 and _ b _ result in a red string which acts only on _",
    "b_. the same scenario can be applied for other choices of the plaquettes , e.g. red and green or red and blue plaquettes , which yield blue and green string leaving the subsystem @xmath129 . however , as we pointed out before one of them will be immaterial since there is an interplay between homology and color .",
    "+ the main point is that it is not possible to produce these colored closed strings which act only on _ b _ from the product of some plaquettes of region _",
    "b_. the same thing will be held for the another disjoint region of _ a _ , say @xmath130 .",
    "so , we have a collection of closed strings with nontrivial effect on _ b _ and we must take into account them in calculation of @xmath60 .",

    "b_. therefore for the case shown in fig.([fig5 ] ) there are only two independent closed strings of this type with a nontrivial effect on _",
    "b_. with these remarks , now the cardinalities @xmath59 and @xmath60 are    [ eq36 ] d_a=2^_a  ,  d_b=2^_b+4 - 2  .",
    "we can generalize the above results for the case that each subsystem is composed of several disconnected regions .",
    "let the partitions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are composed of @xmath133 and @xmath134 disjoint regions , respectively .",
    "so , the cardinalities will be    [ eq33 ] d_a=2^_a+2_m__b-2  ,  d_b=2^_b+2_m__a-2  .",
    "now we move on in order to calculate the topological entanglement entropy defined in eq.([eq35 ] ) . for the partitions shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) we have    _ m__1b=_m__4a=2 ,    [ eq36 ] _",

    "this derivation for topological entanglement entropy of color codes is consistent with the subleading term of scaling of the entropy .",

    "this leads to @xmath101 which has also been derived eq.([eq29 ] ) .",
    "an important class of topological stabilizer codes in practice is planar codes which are topological codes that can be embedded in a piece of planar surface .",
    "these planar codes are very interesting for topological quantum memory and quantum computations@xcite",
    ". a planar color code will be obtained from a 2-colex without border when a couple of plaquettes removed from the code .",
    "for example when a plaquette , say green , is removed only green strings can have endpoint on the removed plaquette not the blue and red strings .",
    "the same scenario holds for other plaquettes . by this construction",
    "we will end with a 2-colex that has three borders each of one color . to each border",
    "only strings can have endpoint which have same color of that border .",
    "the most important class of such planar color code is _ triangular code _ that has been shown in fig.([fig6 ] ) .",
    "the essential property of such code is determined via realizing a 3-string operator and its deformation .",
    "we denote them by @xmath136 and @xmath137 so that @xmath138 since they cross each other once at strings with different colors .",
    "this latter anticommutation relation can also be invoked by considering all qubits which makes the triangular color code very interesting for full implementation of the clifford group without need for selective addressing @xcite .",
    "instead of giving such fruitful properties , we are interested in the entanglement properties of the triangular code .",
    "+ to have a concrete discussion , we consider a triangular lattice which contains hexagons like what has been shown in fig.([fig6 ] ) .",
    "the total number of plaquettes and vertices are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , where @xmath74 in an integer number .",
    "the plaquette operators like those defined in eq.([eq1])have been used in order to define a stabilizer subspace for this code . a main point about the planar code",
    "is that there are no constraints on the action of plaquette operators , i.e they are independent .",
    "for example if we product all red and green plaquette operators , the resulted operator will not be same with the product of red and blue plaquette operators , a property that was absent for color code on compact surface .",
    "however , the product of distinct plaquettes is in the stabilizer group .",
    "the coding space is spanned with the states which are fixed points of all plaquette operators . with the above identifications for the number of plaquettes and vertices ,",
    "the dimension of the coding space will be @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that triangular code encodes a single qubit .",
    "two states are completely determined by the elements of stabilizer group and 3-string operator .",
    "note that here 3-string operator plays a role like nontrivial closed strings in the color code on the torus .",
    "for triangular code the 3-string is nontrivial , i.e. it commutes with all plaquette operators and is not product of some plaquettes .",
    "so the stabilized sates will be    [ eq39 ] |0=|g|^-1/2_ggg|0^|v|  ,  |1=t^x|0",
    ".    a generic state can be in a superposition of the above states such as @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "the reduced density matrix in eq.([eq11 ] ) gives what we need to evaluate the entanglement entropy .",
    "again we make different bipartitions and calculate the entanglement entropy .",
    "+ let the system be in the state @xmath144 .",
    "a single qubit is maximally entangled with rest of the system while two qubits are not entangled implying that the triangular code is also a multipartite entangled structure . as an another bipartition we consider a colored spin chain such as red chain in fig.([fig6]b ) .",
    "this string contains @xmath145 qubits and anticommutes with plaquettes which the string has an endpoint on them , i.e they share in odd number of qubits , thus its action on the coding space amounts to error or on the other hand to the appearance of excitations above the ground state if we adopt the coding space as ground state of a local hamiltonian as in eq.([eq10 ] ) .",
    "however , such a string has maximal entanglement @xmath146 with other qubits of the lattice .",
    "this means that all configuration of the spin chain are allowed in the state @xmath144 of the code , a feature that is similar to the entanglement of an open string in the topological color code on the torus ( see subsec(c ) ) .",
    "+ taking into account the qubits living on the 3-string net as subsystem @xmath52 leads to occurrence of configurations of subsystem @xmath52 with an only even number of spin flipped in the state @xmath144 . for this string net",
    "as shown in fig.([fig6]a ) the number of qubits of the string is @xmath147 , and the entanglement entropy then will become @xmath146 . by inspection",
    "we see that the plaquette operators flip only even number of qubits of the string net .",
    "now let the system be in a generic state such as @xmath148 .",
    "all possible configurations of string net are allowed since all of them can be realized by applying some 3-string operators @xmath136 .",
    "there are @xmath149 configurations with even number of spins flipped and @xmath149 configurations with odd number of spins flipped .",
    "the states @xmath144 and @xmath150include even and odd configurations , respectively .",
    "therefore the entanglement entropy for a generic state will be : @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "+ what about the topological entanglement entropy of planar color codes ?",
    "in order to answer this question we obtain a set of bipartitions such as in fig.([fig4 ] ) in a large triangular code .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 stand for the number of plaquette operators acting only on @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , and @xmath56 stands for the number of plaquette operators acting simultaneously on @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "all plaquette operators are independent . to get things simpler , let consider a simple case where the subsystem @xmath52 is a single convex connected region .",
    "the cardinality of the subgroup @xmath57 is @xmath153 .",
    "however , there are two non - trivial closed string acting on subsystem @xmath53 which is impossible to provide them by product of some plaquettes of @xmath53 .",
    "in fact these two independent strings are resulted from the product of some plaquettes , say red and green , which are free to act on @xmath52 .",
    "so the cardinality of the subgroup @xmath53 reads @xmath154 .",
    "thus for the entanglement entropy we obtain @xmath155 .",
    "+ in order to calculate the topological entanglement entropy , first the entanglement entropy is calculated for different bipartitions and then the expression in eq.([eq35 ] ) gives the topological entropy .",
    "because of the boundaries in the planar codes , for a disconnected region like ( 1 ) or ( 4 ) in fig.([fig4 ] ) the constraint we imposed in eq.([eq33 ] ) is no longer true . for the bipartition ( 1 ) in fig.([fig4 ] ) the cardinalities of subgroups @xmath57 and @xmath58 will be @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "however , for the bipartitions ( 4 ) in fig.([fig4 ] ) the cardinalities will be @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "thus the topological entanglement entropy becomes @xmath160 .",
    "although the closed string structures of bipartitions in the triangular code due to the boundary effects differ from the color code on the torus , the topological entanglement entropy is same for both structures that is related to the fact that both structures have the same symmetry .",
    "in this paper we calculated the entanglement properties of topological color codes ( tcc ) defined on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the entanglement entropy was measured by the von neumann entropy .",
    "we considered two structures of tcc either defined on the compact or planar surface .",
    "the coding space of tcc is spanned by a set of states in which are the fixed points of a set of commuting pauli operators , i.e they are common eigenvectors of all elements of stabilizer group with eigenvalue @xmath161 .",
    "in fact this set stabilizes the coding space .",
    "the stabilizer group is generated from plaquette operators .",
    "product of different plaquette operators produces colored strings which in fact are the closed boundary of several plaquettes . however , there exist some independent non - trivial strings winding the handles of manifold where the model defined on .",
    "this non - trivial strings commute with all plaquette operators but are not actually in the stabilizer group .",

    "the degeneracy of ground state subspace depends on the genus of the manifold which is a feature of topological order .",
    "different states of ground state subspace can be constructed by means of spin flipped elements of stabilizer group and nontrivial closed loops . in order to calculate the entanglement properties of the tcc ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is obtained by integrating out the remanding degrees of freedom .",
    "we did this by using the group properties of the stabilizer group .",
    "+ for both structures of color code on compact and planar surface while a single qubit is maximally entangled with others , two qubits are no longer entangled .",
    "this finding manifests the color code is a genuinely multipartite entangled structure .",
    "we also considered other bipartitions such as spin chains , spin ladders with various colors and homologies .",
    "for all bipartitions we found the entanglement entropy depends on the degrees of freedom living on the boundary of two subsystems .",
    "however , in the entanglement entropy of a convex region , there is a subleading term which is ascribed to the topological properties of region not the geometry , a feature that has also been arisen in a massive topological theory@xcite .",
    "the fact that the entanglement entropy for a region of lattice scales with its boundary is a feature of _ area law _ which is also of great interest in other branch of physics such as black holes@xcite .",
    "+ we exploited the scaling of the entropy to construct a set of bipartitions in order to calculate the topological entanglement entropy of color codes .",
    "we find that it is twice than the topological entropy in the topological toric code .",
    "the non - vanishing value for topological entanglement entropy and dependency of degeneracy on the genus of the surface demonstrate remarkable features on the fact that topological color code maybe fabric to show topological order . for the toric code model the total quantum dimension of excitation is @xmath163 which stands for different superselection sectors of its anyonic excitations .",
    "the total quantum dimension of color code is @xmath164 inspiring that the topological color codes may carry richer anyonic quasiparticles . they may be colored and their braiding will have nontrivial effect on the wavefunction of the system .",
    "indeed braiding of a colored quasiparticle around the another one with different color will give rise to global phase for the wavefunction , i.e they are abelian excitations .",
    "triangular color code with a remarkable application for entanglement distillation is also a highly entangled code .",
    "although the colored strings employed in the 2-colex in the compact surface are not relevant in the triangular code , the notion of string - net gives some essential properties to the triangular code . in the state of the triangular code",
    "all configurations of a colored string , say a red one in fig.([fig6]b ) , are allowed , i.e is has maximal entanglement with the rest of the system .",
