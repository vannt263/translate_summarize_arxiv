    "just like the energy bands of an electron moving in a crystal , floquet ( quasi - energy ) bands capture almost all aspects of a periodically driven system with translational symmetry . as shown by recent theoretical and experimental studies @xcite , floquet bands may possess many intriguing topological phases that are absent in static systems .",
    "it is important to connect floquet band topology with observables and identify clear signatures of the associated topological phase transitions . to that end one fruitful topic is topologically protected edge states , but the issue of bulk - edge correspondence in driven systems is still under development @xcite .",
    "thouless s adiabatic pumping shares the same topological origin as the 2-dimensional integer quantum hall effect @xcite . there",
    "the sum of the chern numbers of all filled energy bands below the fermi surface determines the number of pumped charges @xcite ( though not relevant to this work , we mention that thouless s seminal result is also applicable to many - body systems @xcite ) . in non - equilibrium situations such as driven closed systems , there is no longer a fermi surface to guarantee either filled or empty floquet bands .",
    "nevertheless , an analogous link between floquet band topology and adiabatic transport was also found in driven systems @xcite . indeed , for a closed system ( here we do not consider a system attached to leads as in a traditional transport problem )",
    ", thouless s result may be re - interpreted as the quantized displacement of a band wannier state over one adiabatic cycle @xcite , an interpretation fully consistent with the modern polarization theory @xcite . in parallel to this",
    ", the displacement of the position expectation value of a coherent wavepacket , prepared initially as a wannier state of one floquet band , can also be connected with the floquet - band chern number @xcite . however",
    ", this result is still of limited use in detecting topological phase transitions , because the initial - state preparation already needs the full knowledge of a floquet band ( which is often unavailable ) and the initial state has yet to be re - prepared when a system parameter changes .",
    "this work considers a type of adiabatic dynamics in periodically driven systems for general initial states . to be as simple as possible our calculations",
    "are based on single - particle wavepacket dynamics , though the extension to many non - interacting particles initially occupying many different floquet states can be also done without difficulty .",
    "one of our motivations is to address more realistic situations , where the dynamics emanates from an easy - to - prepare initial state regardless of other system parameters .",
    "the initial state then naturally occupies many floquet bands and thus constitutes a coherent superposition across different floquet bands .",
    "as shown below , such interband coherence ( ibc ) has a rather surprising contribution to the adiabatic dynamics . in short , under one symmetry condition",
    ", the displacement of the time - evolving wavepacket is given by two components : a weighted integral of the berry curvature summed over all floquet bands , _ plus _ an ibc induced correction not captured by a naive application of the quantum adiabatic theorem .",
    "the correction is _ independent _ of the duration of an adiabatic cycle .",
    "that is , no matter how slowly an adiabatic protocol is executed , the same correction emerges .",
    "we shall also briefly discuss the implications of the found correction .",
    "we start with a one - dimensional driven hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represents coordinate and time . the driving period is assumed to be @xmath3 , _",

    "the floquet bands are assumed to be gapped .",
    "the phase convention of the floquet eigenstates is chosen to be @xmath17 , the so - called parallel transport condition . under this convention , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the berry phase .",
    "consider then an adiabatic protocol @xmath20 of duration @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the scaled time , with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "for example , @xmath25 indicates a linear sweeping in @xmath7 .",
    "because the hamiltonian is periodic in @xmath7 with a period @xmath8 , such a protocol implements an adiabatic cycle . for convenience",
    "each small increment in @xmath7 is introduced at multiple ( @xmath26 ) periods of driving , _",
