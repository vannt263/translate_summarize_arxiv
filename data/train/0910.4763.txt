    "particle statistics is a genuinely quantum mechanical concept which has no classical analog . in spatial dimension three and above , the wave function of a many - body quantum state of identical particles remains either unchanged ( bosons ) or undergoes a change of sign ( fermions ) under a pairwise interchange of the particle coordinates .",
    "that there are only two possibilities is a consequence of the fact that there are only two irreducible representations of the permutation group for @xmath1 particles .",
    "however , in @xmath2 dimension , where permutation and exchange are not necessarily equivalent , the quantum statistics of particles can be remarkably different from the ordinary statistics of bosons and fermions @xcite . in this case , under a pairwise interchange of the particle coordinates , it is possible for the many body wave function to receive an arbitrary phase factor @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an angle intermediate between @xmath5 ( boson ) and @xmath6 ( fermion ) .",
    "the particles obeying statistics given by the angle @xmath4 are called anyons @xcite . even if the anyon statistics is remarkably different from that of bosons and fermions ,",
    "since the simple phase factor is only a one - dimensional representation of the braid group in 2d , the statistics is still abelian .",
    "a more exotic possibility , one which has remarkable prospect for fault - tolerant topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite , arises when the quantum ground state of the many - particle system is degenerate . in situations where the many body ground state wave function is a linear combination of states from this degenerate ground state subspace",
    ", a pairwise exchange of the particle coordinates can unitarily _ rotate _ the wave - function in the subspace . in this case",
    ", the exchange statistics is given by a multi - dimensional unitary matrix representation of the 2d braid group , and , thus , the statistics is non - abelian .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that such a system , where the ground state degeneracy is protected by a gap from local perturbations , can be used as a fault - tolerant platform for tqc .",
    "recently , some exotic ordered states in condensed matter systems , such as the pfaffian states in fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems  @xcite and chiral @xmath7-wave superconductors / superfluids  @xcite , as well as the surface state of a topological insulator ( ti ) in which @xmath0-wave superconductivity is induced by proximity effect  @xcite , have been proposed as systems which support quasiparticles with non - abelian statistics , and , therefore , can potentially be used as tqc platforms .",
    "the common thread between these systems is that they all allow quasiparticle excitations which involve no energy cost ( when the mutual separation among the excitations is large ) .",
    "the second quantized operators , @xmath8 , corresponding to these zero energy excitations are self - hermitian , @xmath9 , which is in striking contrast to ordinary fermionic ( or bosonic ) operators for which @xmath10 . however , since @xmath8 and @xmath11 , which are called majorana fermion operators , anticommute when @xmath12 , they retain some properties of ordinary fermion operators as well .",
    "it is the self - hermitian property of the majorana operators which lies at the heart of the ground state degeneracy and the resulting non - abelian statistics @xcite of quasiparticle excitations in these systems .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that even a regular semiconducting film with a sizable spin - orbit coupling , such as ingaas thin films , can host , under suitable conditions , majorana fermion excitations localized near defects . by an analysis of the real - space bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for a vortex in the semiconductor , in which @xmath0-wave superconductivity and a zeeman splitting are proximity induced ( fig .",
    "( 1a ) ) , it has been shown that the lowest energy quasiparticle excitation is a zero - energy majorana fermion mode .",
    "the majorana mode is separated by a finite energy gap ( so - called mini - gap ) from the other conventional fermionic excited states in the vortex core .",
    "thus , for a collection of well - separated vortices , the resulting degenerate ground state subspace is protected from the environment by the mini - gap , enabling the potential use of the semiconductor heterostructure in fig .",
    "( 1a ) in tqc . since the basic effects behind the emergence of the majorana fermion excitations  spin - orbit coupling , @xmath0-wave superconductivity , and zeeman splitting  are physically well - understood and experimentally known to occur in many solid state materials , the proposed semiconductor heterostructure @xcite is possibly one of the simplest systems to realize , which supports non - abelian topological order .    in this paper , we show that the existence of the majorana fermion zero modes at the cores of the vortices in the semiconductor heterostructure in fig .",
    "( 1a ) is due to an index theorem .",
    "the theorem is analogous to the one proven by jackiw and rebbi @xcite for the existence of zero energy eigenstates at mass domain walls in a 1d system of dirac fermions , which was later applied @xcite to prove the existence of zero - energy excitations at vortices in a spinless 2d chiral @xmath7-wave superconductor . in analogy with the chiral @xmath7-wave superconductor , we find that while an odd flux - quantum vortex in the semiconductor thin film traps a unique zero energy eigenstate , an even flux - quantum vortex does not . furthermore , since the components of the fermion field in our analog of the 1d dirac theory are pairwise related by parity reversal and hermitian conjugation , we explicitly show that the second quantized operator corresponding to the zero - energy eigensolution is self - hermitian , @xmath13 .",
    "this is in contrast to the corresponding problem solved by jackiw and rebbi for the conventional dirac theory , where the two components of the fermion field are independent , and , therefore , the zero - energy excitations localized in the mass domain walls are conventional fermion excitations .",
    "the momentum space construction of the zero - energy solution presented here is complementary to the approximate real space solution @xcite of the four - component bdg equations at a vortex in the semiconductor in which superconductivity has been induced by the proximity effect .",
    "the single - particle effective hamiltonian @xmath14 for the conduction band of a spin - orbit - coupled semiconducting thin film in contact with a magnetic insulator ( which induces the zeeman splitting ) is given by ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 , where , @xmath17_{\\beta,\\gamma } c^{\\dagger}_{\\textbf{k},\\beta}c_{\\textbf{k},\\gamma } + { \\rm{h .",

    "then , for any value of the chemical potential , the system has two fermi surfaces . with a finite zeeman splitting ,",
    "the bands have an energy gap near @xmath21 ( blue lines ) .",
    "if the chemical potential lies in the gap , the system just has one fermi surface ( indicated by the dotted circle ) , a situation conducive to the emergence of non - abelian order . ]",
    "the coefficient @xmath22 describes the strength of the rashba spin - orbit coupling in the semiconductor , @xmath23 are the spin indices , and @xmath24 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the energy spectrum of the spin - orbit - coupled semiconductor with @xmath25 has two bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with the metallic surface state of a strong ti where an odd number of bands cross the fermi level . however , by placing the semiconductor in the proximity to a magnetic insulator , it is possible to open a gap in the spectrum , see fig .",
    "( 1b ) . then , for @xmath26 , a single band crosses the fermi level .",
    "this situation is then analogous to the surface of a strong ti in that an odd number of bands cross the fermi level  @xcite , and , therefore , is suggestive of supporting non - abelian topological order if @xmath0-wave superconductivity can be induced in the film .",
    "this way , by replacing the surface of a 3d strong topological insulator by a regular semiconducting thin - film , the scope of solid state systems which can be designed to support non - abelian topological order can be vastly expanded @xcite .    in the presence of an adjacent @xmath0-wave superconductor , which induces an @xmath0-wave pairing potential in the semiconductor by the proximity effect ,",

    "( [ condition - xi ] ) is also satisfied .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticle operator corresponding to the zero mode solution in eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) is a majorana fermion operator .",
    "the proof of the index theorem presented above relies on the rotational invariance of the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian as well as of the vortex profile , together with the assumption that a single band ( lower band , @xmath133 ) dominates the wave - function of the majorana bound state .",
    "the latter assumption is valid in the limit @xmath198 .",
    "however , as shown below , the question of the existence of the non - degenerate majorana mode in this system is robust to deviations from such assumptions , and the majorana state can only be removed by a bulk phase transition in the system .",
    "thus , a non - degenerate majorana bound state is topologically protected .    in order to see the topological protection of the majorana mode ,",
    "let us consider an isotropic bcs hamiltonian @xmath199 with a symmetric vortex and a small value of @xmath36 ( basically , @xmath199 is the same as @xmath72 ) , for which the derivation presented above can be used to show the existence of a non - degenerate majorana mode bound to a vortex with an odd number of flux quantum .",
    "in addition , let us consider a second bcs hamiltonian @xmath200 which is possibly anisotropic ( _ i.e_. , breaks rotational symmetry ) near the vortex and has a strong pairing potential .",
    "therefore , @xmath200 does not lend itself to a simple analytic treatment as given above .",
    "given these two hamiltonians @xmath199 and @xmath200 , we can construct a family of bcs hamiltonians parameterized by @xmath201 given by @xmath202 .",
    "since both @xmath199 and @xmath200 approach the bulk hamiltonian away from the vortex core , so does @xmath203 . therefore , as long as the superconductor has a non - zero bulk gap , @xmath204 , away from the vortex core , we expect all the eigenstates of @xmath203 with energy less than @xmath204 to be localized at the vortex core",
    ". furthermore , since only a finite number of states can be localized near the vortex core , there should be a discrete set of eigenstates with energies satisfying @xmath205 bound to the vortex core .",
    "here , in analogy with a @xmath7-wave superconductor / superfluid @xcite , @xmath206 is an index for the states with @xmath207 , where @xmath170 is an integer and @xmath208 .",
    "note that , if for some value of @xmath209 , @xmath210 , a single zero energy state is allowed .",
    "conversely , if @xmath211 , no zero mode is allowed . in general , the shift @xmath212 can be taken such that it represents an even number ( including @xmath5 ) zero modes by @xmath211 and an odd number of zero modes by @xmath210 .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations of @xmath203 are given by the equation , @xmath213=e_{(s(\\lambda)+n)}(\\lambda)d^\\dagger_{(s(\\lambda)+n)}(\\lambda).\\ ] ] where @xmath214 are taken as the quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators . by considering the hermitian conjugate of the above equation , it can be seen that the solutions of @xmath203 are paired such that @xmath215 and @xmath216 . in the case where @xmath203 has a single zero energy solution , @xmath217 , it is clear that the corresponding zero mode @xmath218 is a majorana mode @xmath219 . since @xmath199 in our problem",
    "is assumed to have a non - degenerate majorana mode ( as we have shown by analyzing @xmath72 ) , @xmath220 .",
    "the stability of this non - degenerate majorana zero mode to small perturbations in the bdg hamiltonian follows from the fact that as long as the low energy states in the vicinity of the vortex core remain discrete in energy spacing , the eigenstates labeled by the index @xmath221 evolve continuously with @xmath209 , and thus the shift @xmath212 can not jump from it s value @xmath5 to it s other allowed value @xmath121 .",
    "thus , @xmath222 , which implies that @xmath200 has a non - degenerate majorana mode as well , even though @xmath200 itself does not lend itself to a simple analysis .    from the above argument it is clear that a non - degenerate majorana bound state at a vortex remains protected as long as the low energy states in the vicinity of the vortex core remain discrete in number for all values of the parameter @xmath201 .",
    "thus the majorana bound state is robust to all local deformations of the hamiltonian in the vicinity of the vortex core since these can not affect the energy gap away from the vortex .",
    "on the other hand , if changing the parameter @xmath209 changes the bulk parameters of the hamiltonian , such as @xmath22 , @xmath20 or @xmath223 , then it is possible for the energy gap to close away from the vortex core , causing the states bound to the vortex core to become delocalized .",
    "this results in a breakdown of the above argument for the topological stability of the majorana bound states .",
    "thus , the presence or absence of a non - degenerate majorana bound state at a vortex core leads to a classification of the phase diagram of two - dimensional superconductors with spin - orbit coupling , such that the phases which support non - degenerate majorana bound states are separated from the phases that do not by a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) where the bulk energy gap closes .",
    "the quantum phases on the two sides of the above qpt can be determined by studying a deformation parameter @xmath209 that controls the proximity - induced pairing potential in the semiconductor , _",
    "i.e. _ , the pairing potential in @xmath203 is given by @xmath224 .",
    "the pairing potential increases from @xmath5 ( @xmath225 ) to a maximum value @xmath36 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the proof presented above shows that for @xmath226 , for which there is a single band crossing the fermi - level , and for @xmath227 , there is a non - degenerate majorana mode bound to the core of a vortex . from the bulk hamiltonian @xmath203 , it is easy to check that the energy gap in the bulk vanishes at a critical value @xcite , @xmath228 thus our argument for the topological protection of the majorana bound state implies that a majorana bound state exists at the vortex core in @xmath203 as long as @xmath229 or @xmath230 .",
    "moreover , this phase is separated from the phase with @xmath231 by a qpt at which the single particle energy gap vanishes .",
    "the spin - dependent terms in the hamiltonian , such as the zeeman splitting and the spin - orbit coupling , cease to play a critical role in the phase @xmath231 , and it is possible to reduce both these couplings to zero without crossing another phase transition ( _ i.e. _ , without @xmath204 going through @xmath5 again ) .",
    "thus , the phase @xmath231 must be in the same class as a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor without spin - orbit coupling or zeeman splitting , and therefore can not support a non - degenerate majorana mode .",
    "furthermore , the symmetries of the superconducting order parameters are identical in these two phases .",
    "therefore , these two phases , distinguished by the presence or absence of a majorana mode , are separated by a topological qpt at @xmath232 where the energy gap closes .",
    "we prove a theorem for the existence of majorana zero modes in a semiconducting thin film with a sizable spin - orbit coupling , in which @xmath0-wave superconductivity and a zeeman splitting are induced by proximity effect ( fig .",
    "our momentum - space construction of the zero - mode solution in the form of the jackiw - rebbi index theorem @xcite , which is complementary to the approximate real - space solution of the bdg equations at a vortex core @xcite , proves the existence of non - degenerate majorana fermion excitations localized at the vortices in the semiconductor heterostructure shown in fig .",
    "( 1a ) .    in our method , no special form ( in particular , the frequently - used step - function form @xcite ) for the real - space profile of the superconducting pairing potential near the vortex core is required .",
    "we use only the antisymmetry property of the intra - band pairing potentials , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( eq .  ( [ h_treal ] ) ) under @xmath180 , which is a consequence of the fermion anticommutation relations .",
    "therefore , the non - degenerate majorana mode found here is robust to local spatial deformations of the order parameter . for the construction in this paper to apply",
    ", it is crucial that a single total angular momentum channel ( for a vortex with a single flux quantum : @xmath113 ) can be isolated from the rest of the hamiltonian . in the cases where this is not possible , _",
    "e.g. _ , for a vortex with an even number of flux quanta , the theorem does not apply and a non - degenerate zero - energy solution is not expected at the vortex core .",
    "the methods of this paper can be straightforwardly applied to the zero modes on the surface of a ti with a non - zero chemical potential in the presence of a superconducting vortex @xcite , but not to the case when the chemical potential on the ti surface is zero . however , in the latter special case of zero chemical potential , an exact solution of the bdg equations already exists @xcite for the zero - mode eigenfunction for arbitrary real - space profile of the order parameter .",
