    "in the standard model for pulsar evolution ( gunn & ostriker 1970 ) , young rapidly rotating pulsars are expected to be harboured within the remnants of the supernova explosions in which they were formed .",
    "the two best  known examples of young pulsars , _ viz . _ crab and vela , were discovered in the early days of pulsar astronomy ( staelin & reifenstein 1968 ; large et al .",
    "the overwhelming evidence in favour of their association with the crab and vela supernova remnants helped to establish the basic rotating neutron star model to explain the pulsar phenomenon ( pacini 1968 ; gold 1968 ) . in this paper , we describe a survey carried out to find pulsars associated with supernova remnants in the northern hemisphere .    in the past few years",
    ", the number of _ proposed associations _ between pulsars and supernova remnants has risen to around 30 ( see kaspi 1996 for a recent review ) .",
    "this is a result of a number of different approaches : high frequency searches of the galactic plane ( clifton et al .",
    "1992 ; johnston et al .",
    "1992 ) ; cross  correlations of the pulsar and supernova remnant catalogues ( caraveo 1993 ; frst et al .  1993 ;",
    "kulkarni et al .  1993 ) ; targeted searches for pulsars in remnants ( frail & moffett 1993 ; gorham et al .",
    "1996 ; kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) and remnants around young pulsars ( frail et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the number of spurious associations in this sample , _ i.e. _ those cases where the pulsar and the supernova remnant are merely in chance alignment on the sky , is likely to be significant . theoretically , the expected number of associations has a complex dependence on a number of factors : the luminosity function and initial spin period of young pulsars ( narayan 1987 ; narayan & schaudt 1988 ) , their beaming fraction ( lyne & manchester 1988 ; biggs 1990 ) , space velocities ( shull et al .",
    "1989 ; caraveo 1993 ; lyne & lorimer 1994 ) , the evolution of supernova remnants ( gaensler & johnston 1995a&b ) as well as the fraction of all supernovae that produce pulsars . in a detailed statistical analysis ,",
    "gaensler & johnston ( 1995b ) concluded that fewer than 10 associations are expected to be real .",
    "statistical studies require accurate flux density upper limits for any pulsars undetected in remnants .",
    "our search complements recent targeted searches on southern supernova remnants at parkes ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) , on those remnants visible from arecibo ( gorham et al .",
    "1996 ) , as well as an earlier survey at jodrell bank ( biggs & lyne 1996 ) .",
    "the present survey was successful , discovering two new pulsars as well as substantially improving on previous upper limits for the flux density of any pulsars in the target remnants .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , > , > , > , < \" , ]     as discussed in sect .",
    "[ ssec : assoc ] , both of the newly discovered pulsars in this survey , psrs j0215@xmath16218 and j1957@xmath12831 , have characteristic ages much larger than that expected for their target remnants .",
    "if they were to be genuinely associated with these remnants , then both the pulsars would have had to have been born with periods similar to the presently observed values , 0.5 and 0.3 seconds , in order to explain the large characteristic ages .",
    "in addition , the respective observed value of @xmath2 for these pulsars 0.7 and 0.8 does _ not _ place them in the group of pairs most likely to be genuinely associated . based on the results of the above analysis",
    ", there is no strong statistical requirement for either of these pulsars to be associated with the remnants although they can not be entirely ruled out .    whether a significant number of radio pulsars were born with such long periods is controversial .",
    "several authors , notably vivekanand & narayan ( 1981 ) , narayan ( 1987 ) , narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) and deshpande et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have found evidence for `` injection '' of pulsars into the population with periods @xmath3 ms , however other authors ( lyne et al .  1985 ; stollman 1987 ; lorimer et al .  1993 ) find no requirement for it . from an inspection of the pulse periods listed in table [ tab : top8 ] , with the possible exception of psr b2334 + 61 ,",
    "none of the pulsars listed in table  [ tab : top8 ] are likely to have had such long periods at birth .",
    "indeed kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1993 ) argue that psr b2334 + 61 is the energy source to g114.3 + 0.3 , which appears to be a crab - like nebula . in this case",
    ", the initial period of b2334 + 61 must have been @xmath4 ms .",
    "thus the simplest , and most likely conclusion , to be drawn from the present sample of pulsar ",
    "supernova remnant pairs is that they support the notion that all pulsars are born with initial spin periods @xmath4 ms .",
    "finally we wish to point out that , whilst our method is in principle sensitive to pairs over a large range in @xmath2 , the sample that we have used for our analysis is far from homogeneous . therefore any real pairs with @xmath5 are most likely to be underestimated in the present sample in comparison with those with @xmath6 since many of the targeted searches for pulsars in remnants have concentrated mainly close to the remnant centre . indeed , together with the searches by gorham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , our search represents the first major effort to search the entire area , rather than just the centroid , of many of the more extended supernova remnants .",
    "further searches with improved sensitivity to pulsars with @xmath5 will improve the situation .",
    "new multibeam searches of the galactic plane , presently underway at parkes and jodrell bank , should provide a more homogeneous sample for further statistical studies .",
    "we have conducted a sensitive search for pulsars in supernova remnants .",
    "the search detected a total of three pulsars , two of which were previously unknown .",
    "the new pulsars , j0215@xmath16218 and j1957@xmath12831 , were found during searches of the supernova remnants g132.7@xmath11.3 and g65.1@xmath10.6 respectively .",
    "the case for associations between the new pulsars and their target remnants is presently unclear . from an analysis of the present sample of radio pulsars and supernova remnants ,",
    "we reach two main conclusions : ( i ) the number of real associations in the present sample is at most @xmath7 . ( ii )",
    "these are most likely to occur for pairs with @xmath6 for which we see a clear excess in the observed distribution compared with that expected by chance .",
    "based on this analysis , neither of the two newly discovered pulsars seem likely to be genuinely associated . in order to unambiguously confirm / refute both these candidate associations , measurements of the pulsar proper motions are required .",
    "such measurements would determine in each case whether the pulsar velocity is of the correct magnitude and direction to carry them to their presently position with respect to the remnant centre .",
    "interferometric measurements to determine the proper motion of both pulsars using merlin , the * m*ulti*e*lement * r*adio * l*inked * i*nterferometer network operated by the university of manchester have recently been initiated .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank christine jordan and jon bell for help with the observations , as well as nichi damico , luciano nicastro and dick manchester for making their search software available to us and lee hannan for his assistance with the flux density determinations .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee for constructive and useful comments . during this project ,",
