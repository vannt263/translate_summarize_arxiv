    "the distribution of baryons in the universe remains one of the puzzling issues in modern cosmology . at the present epoch , the total amount of baryons inferred from a census of hi absorption , gas and stars in galaxies , and x - ray emission from hot gas in galaxy clusters is far smaller than that predicted by nucleosynthesis calculations ( persic & salucci 1992 ; fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) and by measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( spergel et al .",
    "hence , it is believed that a large fraction of the baryons lies in an as yet undiscovered _ dark _ state .",
    "three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of cosmic structure formation ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 ; croft et al .",
    "2002 ) predict that about 3040% of the baryons reside in the so - called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) at the present epoch .",
    "this gas is mostly shock - heated to a temperature of @xmath3@xmath4 k during large scale structure formation , and this relatively low temperature makes its thermal emission difficult to detect with conventional x - ray probes .",
    "a variety of observational approaches have been considered for studying the whim , including both ultraviolet ( e.g. , furlanetto et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) and x - ray lines .",
    "with respect to the latter possibility , there have been several tentative claims that the whim has been detected locally in absorption ( e.g. , nicastro et al .",
    "2002 ) and in emission ( finoguenov et al . 2003 ) . moreover , yoshikawa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have proposed using ovii / oviii lines to examine the whim in detail with high spectral resolution x - ray detectors .",
    "they argue that , under a variety of assumptions , about half of the whim ( by mass ) can be detected via oxygen line emission ( see also fang et al .",
    "while the proposed missions appear promising , the detectability depends crucially on the assumed metallicity and the relative abundances of particular ions .",
    "previous theoretical studies used a single - temperature model for the whim , under the assumption that equipartition is fully achieved",
    ". however , the outskirts of galaxy clusters may actually have a two - temperature structure ( e.g. , fox & loeb 1997 ; takizawa 1998 ; courty & alimi 2004 ) .",
    "near galaxy clusters , infalling gas shock - heats to roughly the virial temperature as kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy . because the infalling ions carry nearly all of the bulk kinetic energy ( exceeding that contained in electrons by a factor @xmath5 ) , the post - shock electrons can gain thermal energy only via collisions with ions . if collisional relaxation takes a time comparable to or longer than the age of the universe , the two temperatures , i.e. those of the electrons and ions , remain different .",
    "one can easily show that the relaxation time is rather long for diffuse warm - hot gas around clusters and in large - scale filamentary structures .",
    "since the relative abundance of metal ions and their emissivities are sensitive to the electron temperature , this has important implications for future observations of the whim , particularly for the hotter component .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we study the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) using a large hydrodynamic    simulation of structure formation .",
    "we show that a considerable fraction of the whim indeed has a two - temperature structure , particularly in and around rich clusters . in these regions ,",
    "the electron temperature is typically smaller than the ion temperature by a factor of a few , substantially modifying estimates of the abundances of ions and their emissivities .",
    "for our simulations , we use the parallel tree - pm / sph code gadget2 ( v. springel , in preparation ) , which employs a fully conservative scheme for integrating the equations of motion ( springel & hernquist 2002 ) .",
    "we implement non - equipartition processes between ions and electrons following fox & loeb ( 1997 ) and takizawa ( 1998 ) .",
    "equilibrium in an electron - proton plasma is achieved in the following manner . after passing through a shock ,",
    "electrons and ions thermalize into ( separate ) maxwellian distributions on equilibration timescales @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ( spitzer 1962 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electron and ion masses and we have assumed protons dominate the ionic component .",
    "equipartition between protons and electrons is achieved on an even longer timescale @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we assume that electrons and ions quickly achieve maxwellian distributions with temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and consider only the non - equipartition effect .",
    "spitzer ( 1962 ) showed that the appropriate timescale is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric charge , @xmath15 is the charge of an ion , @xmath16 is the ion number density , and @xmath17 is the coulomb logarithm , which is given by @xmath18 for a hot , fully ionized plasma , @xmath19 and this timescale can be comparable to the hubble time in regions with @xmath20 k and overdensities @xmath21 with respect to the cosmic mean .",
    "the evolution of the electron temperature is given by @xmath22 we do not consider heat conduction on the assumption that it will be suppressed by tangled magnetic fields .",
    "some other electron heating processes driven by plasma instabilities have also been proposed ( laming 2000 ) , but detailed calculations in the context of supernova remnants suggest that these mechanisms convert less than @xmath23% of the bulk kinetic energy to electron thermal energy ( e.g. , cargill & papadopoulos 1988 ) , so we neglect these effects .",
    "our treatment therefore maximizes the possible offset between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we work with a flat @xmath24-dominated cold dark matter cosmology with matter density @xmath25 , cosmological constant @xmath26 and expansion rate at the present time @xmath27 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 .",
    "we set the baryon density @xmath29 and the normalization parameter @xmath30 .",
    "our simulation employs @xmath31 cold dark matter particles and the same number of non - radiative gas particles in a cosmological volume 100 @xmath32 mpc on a side .",
    "the mass per gas particle is @xmath33 , and the nominal gas mass resolution is about @xmath34 for our choice of the number of sph neighbors , @xmath35 .",
    "we note that the cdm initial conditions and the large simulation volume allow us to correctly model the merging process during the formation of filamentary structures and the assembly of massive halos which contribute to heating of the igm as well as the intracluster medium ( icm ; e.g. , keshet et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the baryon distribution at @xmath36 in a slice 20 @xmath32 mpc thick ( top ) , the hot component with temperature @xmath37 k ( middle ) , and gas in which @xmath38 . the latter two components are quite similar , suggesting that much of the hotter whim has a two - temperature structure .",
    "the distribution of the two - temperature gas appears quite complex even in clusters ,    indicating that shocks induced by mergers during hierarchical assembly propagate and leave two - temperature gas within clusters .",
    "we have checked the time variation of the specific entropy of the gas elements and verified that the two - temperature regions have recently been shock - heated . in the gas around large - scale structure , _ continuous",
    "_ shock - heating disturbs equipartition sufficiently close to the shock , while more distant gas is often relaxed .",
    "figure 2 shows the electron temperature @xmath11 plotted against the mean temperature @xmath39 , which is the temperature we would obtain in a single temperature model .",
    "interestingly , the two - temperature deviation is largest in the whim regime ( indicated by the rectangular box ) .",
    "note that there are some gas elements with @xmath40 .",
    "this is because our simulation does not include electron heating processes other than coulomb collisions .",
    "figure 3 shows the radial distribution of @xmath11 ( solid line ) and @xmath41 ( dashed line ) for one of the most massive halos in our simulation .",
    "we used a friends - of - friends group - finder to locate dark matter halos and define the virial radius such that the mean matter density within this radius is 200 times the critical density .",
    "the halo we consider here has a virial mass of @xmath42 and a virial radius of @xmath43 mpc . in figure 3 ,",
    "the difference between the two temperatures is large at @xmath44 mpc and appreciable even at @xmath45 mpc .",
    "the overall profile looks similar to those found in simulations of single clusters by takizawa ( 1998 ) and chieze et al .",
    "owing to the difference in relaxation time ( see eq .",
    "[ 3 ] ) in the dense central part and in the low density outer regions , the electron temperature profile appears steeper than that of the mean temperature at @xmath46 mpc .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 shows the baryonic mass fraction as a function of both @xmath11 and @xmath41 ( thick and thin histograms , respectively ) .",
    "we selected gas particles within 5 @xmath32 mpc of the cluster center .",
    "the distribution of @xmath47 is skewed significantly to smaller values .",
    "the total gas mass contained in this region ( @xmath48 mpc ) is @xmath49 , and nearly 50% of it has @xmath50 kev ; i.e. , the mass of the warm    component surrounding the cluster is greater than the gas mass within the cluster itself .",
    "the two - temperature structure of the whim and icm has many important implications .",
    "for example , the relative fractions of metal ions are of considerable interest for whim observations .",
    "figure 4 shows the fraction of ovi , ovii , and oviii ions as a function of temperature assuming collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "clearly the abundances have a strong dependence on _ electron _ temperature , because the populations are primarily determined by electron collisions ( photo - ionization is unimportant for these high - level ions unless @xmath51k or the incident x - ray intensity is high ) .",
    "the bottom panel indicates the possible errors caused by assuming a single temperature for the whim .",
    "a factor of two systematic shift in temperature , typical of the offsets we find between @xmath41 and @xmath11 near shocks , can lead to significant over / under - estimates of the abundances .",
    "we further quantify the importance of non - equipartition with a model oxygen line emission map .",
    "we put the super - cluster region indicated in figure 1 at @xmath52 and compute the surface brightness of ovii emission following the procedure of yoshikawa et al .",
    "we adopt a simple relation between the gas metallicity and the local gas density of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mean baryon density .",
    "we then compute the surface brightness for both @xmath11 and @xmath41 .",
    "figure 5 shows the    derived profiles .",
    "while the overall results appear similar in the two cases , there are substantial local deviations .",
    "in particular , around some bright spots , the emissivity is greater by up to an order of magnitude when computed using the electron temperature .",
    "the ratio of the surface brightness @xmath55 is shown in the bottom panel of figure 5 . there",
    ", we mark the regions with @xmath56 , which is the nominal detection limit of the proposed dios mission ( yoshikawa et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "similar considerations may also apply to efforts to study the whim using uv observations ( e.g. , furlanetto et al .",
    "2004 ) , although the steep temperature dependence of @xmath57 implies that equipartition is more accurate in this regime ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in principle , one can measure the degree of equilibration using various line intensities from far uv to soft x - rays ( e.g. , ghavamian et al . 2001 ; raymond et al . 2003 ) as well as the metal line doppler widths . measuring the age of the whim from the degree of equilibration will put a stringent constraint on theoretical models of large - scale _ baryonic _ structure formation .",
    "although our simulation does not include radiative cooling , we note that the lower electron temperature can have a significant impact on the radiative cooling efficiency in dense regions .",
    "the gas cooling rate has a very steep temperature dependence at @xmath58k regardless of the metallicity ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , recently shock - heated gas with @xmath59k may have an electron temperature @xmath60k .",
    "such gas should cool rapidly and in a highly non - equilibrium manner .",
    "this warrants further study of the effect of the two - temperature structure on the igm using a simulation with radiative cooling .",
    "overall , our simulation suggests that theoretical studies of the whim and correct interpretation of the observational data from current and future x - ray missions requires explicit consideration of these relaxation processes ."
