    "the opening of a spin gap is of fundamental interest in one - dimensional spin one - half systems . in one - dimensional heisenberg spin chains",
    "the coupling between the spins and lattice leads to the spin - peierls instability ; the atomic distances change together with the nearest neighbor exchange coupling between the spins . as a result the spin gap opens separating the singlet ground state from the excited triplet state .",
    "the spin - peierls instability was discovered in organic compounds and later on in inorganic cugeo@xmath14@xcite .",
    "although @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 is another spin one - half quasi - one - dimensional compound where the spin gap opening and the lattice distortion take place simultaneously@xcite , it is different from canonical spin - peierls systems .",

    "an extra degree of freedom comes from one electron being shared by the v - o - v rung as @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 is a quarter - filled two leg spin ladder compound . in the low temperature phase unpaired electrons on v - o - v rungs shift from the middle of the rung to off - center positions and a zigzag pattern of v@xmath15 and v@xmath16 ions along the ladder legs exists on all ladders@xcite .",
    "there are four ladder planes in the unit cell at ambient pressure and under high pressure a series of successive phase transitions to phases with more than four planes in the unit cell are observed@xcite .",
    "@xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 is not an ideal one - dimensional spin system as revealed by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins)@xcite .",
    "in addition to the dispersion of magnetic excitations along the ladder direction two dispersion curves with a rather small dispersion of 1.2mev along the ladder rung direction are observed .",
    "one curve is at 8mev and the other at 10mev at the center of the brillouin zone .",

    "doubling of the lattice constants along a- and b - axes and quadrupling along c - axis create additional raman and infrared active modes at the phase transition temperature .",
    "the question is whether they are all zone - folded lattice modes or some of them are spin excitations .",
    "the controversial modes are infrared active modes polarized along the c - axis at 68 and 106@xmath3 and raman modes with frequencies nearly matching the frequencies of the two infrared modes .",
    "the origin of the 68 and 106@xmath3 excitations is of fundamental interest since the 68@xmath3 excitation is almost degenerate with the 65.5@xmath3 triplet .",
    "spin chain models do not predict a bound singlet excitation being degenerate with the triplet excitation@xcite .",
    "electric and magnetic dipole transitions between singlet and triplet states are forbidden in principle .",
    "the reason for this is the different parity of the ground singlet state and the excited triplet state .",

    "our data shows that there is an absorption continuum in the a - axis polarized optical absorption that develops a gap at low @xmath291 .",
    "this gap , 130@xmath3 , is equal to twice the singlet - triplet excitation energy , 65.4@xmath3 .",
    "therefore the absorption continuum can be assigned to an absorption of a photon with a simultaneous creation of two magnetic ( spin ) excitations .",
    "two low frequency a - axis polarized optical phonons , at 91 and 140@xmath3 interact with the magnetic system as evidenced by their derivative - like line shape in the high @xmath291 phase .",
    "using far - infrared spectroscopy we have probed spin excitations and phonons in the quarter - filled spin ladder compound @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the interaction between the spins and the phonons is observed in the gapped spin state below 34k and above , in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the zigzag charge order within the ladders in the gapped state is in accordance with the polarization dependence of several infrared active zone - folded optical phonons . in the high @xmath291 phase two a - axis optical phonons",
    "interact with the continuum of excitations as manifested by the fano line - shape of phonon lines . at low @xmath291",
    "the continuum absorption is gapped with a threshold energy 130@xmath3 , twice the singlet - triplet gap , and the interaction between the phonons and the continuum of excitations is turned off .",
    "the strength of the singlet to triplet absorption at 65.4@xmath3 is strongly anisotropic .",
    "absorption is strongest when the electric field of the incident light is polarized along the ladder rungs ( @xmath388 ) . in this polarization",
    "the strength of the singlet to triplet absorption has a weak magnetic field dependence up to 28 t . in @xmath389 polarization a strong magnetic field dependence of the singlet - triplet absorption is observed .",
    "this field dependence is due to the dynamic dm interaction created by the 68@xmath3 c - axis optical phonon . in the case of the dynamic dm absorption mechanism",
    "the singlet - triplet absorption is electric dipole active and the polarization of the transition is determined by the polarization of the optical phonon creating the dynamic dm interaction by the lattice deformation . using the presented theory we calculated the strength of the dynamic dm interaction .",
    "the dynamic dm interaction , @xmath331@xmath3 , created by the 68@xmath3 c - axis optical phonon is inter - ladder between the spins in the neighboring planes and points along the b - axis .",
    "we assign the strong a - axis polarized absorption also to a dynamic dm effect , in this case due to the lattice deformation caused by one of the high frequency a - axis optical phonons .",
    "this dynamic dm interaction is intra - ladder and is along the c - axis . above 28 t",
    "an increase in the s to t@xmath476 a - axis absorption intensity is observed .",
    "the origin of the mechanism responsible for that increase is not clear and additional measurements above 33 t are required .    to summarize ,",
    "the optical singlet to triplet transition in @xmath0-nav@xmath1o@xmath2 is dominated by an electric dipole active mechanism .",
    "we have observed the resonant enhancement of the singlet to triplet transition close to the c - axis 68@xmath3 mode .",
    "we described the enhancement of the electric dipole transition with the theory of the dynamic dm mechanism and assigned the 68@xmath3 mode to a c - axis optical phonon . from the analysis of the phonon infrared spectra we concluded that two types of ladder planes exist with the zigzag charge order along the ladders where the charged stripes across the ladders are aligned approximately in @xmath454 $ ] or in @xmath455 $ ] directions .",
