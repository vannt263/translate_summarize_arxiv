    "one of the most powerful ways to unveil the formation and evolution of galaxies is to study their spectra .",
    "since william wollaston first observed sunlight passing through a prism in 1802 to reveal a rich spectrum , spectral lines have been used to understand the physical processes governing the evolution of stars and galaxies .",
    "galaxy spectra feature stellar absorption and nebular emission lines , both of which have been studied extensively over the past several decades .",
    "the prominent absorption features seen in galaxy spectra reflect the average surface gravities , effective temperatures , metal abundances and kinematics of their stellar components and thus hold a preserved record of a galaxy s formation and evolution . in order to measure the strength of various stellar absorption lines so as to compare them across different objects and facilitate the prediction of theoretical models we require a common system of integrated light spectroscopy , the most prominent of which is the lick / ids system @xcite .",
    "this widely - used system spans the optical wavelength regime from cn at @xmath34150  to tio@xmath4 at @xmath36200  and defines a total of 25 standard absorption line indices .",
    "measurements of these absorption line strengths , combined with stellar population models have been effectively used to study galaxy properties , such as : luminosity - weighted ages , metallicities and abundance ratios of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "nebular emission lines , on the other hand , probe the physical state of the ionized gas in galaxies and thus can be used to trace the nuclear activity of , for example , a central supermassive black hole or their instantaneous rate of star formation @xcite .",
    "emission - line ratios have been turned into powerful diagnostic tools , not just for individual galaxies , but for massive spectroscopic surveys . @xcite",
    "first proposed the use of diagnostic diagrams , which have subsequently been used and refined by numerous research groups @xcite . throughout the past two decades",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has established the largest and most homogeneous database of both photometric and spectroscopic data for galaxies . using the apache point observatory s 2.5 m telescope ,",
    "the sdss has obtained 9400 @xmath5 of imaging in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands @xcite on the ab magnitude system @xcite , considering both astrometric @xcite and photometric @xcite calibrations .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy @xcite has furthermore yielded nearly one million objects spectroscopically classified as `` galaxies '' ( see tab .  1 and fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the seventh , and latest , data release of the sdss ( sdss dr7 , @xcite ) is notably improved , in terms of both photometry and spectroscopy , and is to date the largest sized database .    the sdss spectroscopic database has been useful in numerous investigations ; however , the sdss pipeline measurements still suffer from a few crucial shortcomings .",
    "the most serious is that the pipeline values for the absorption - line strength are not corrected for the impact of nebular emissions .",
    "not accounting for emission infills leads to an underestimation of the true strength of various absorption - line features and , in objects with strong emission lines - such as star - bursting systems or active nuclei - a more refined treatment of the nebular component may be needed to secure an unbiased extraction of the stellar kinematic .",
    "furthermore , when measuring the ionised - gas emission it is desirable to include reddening by dust and impose a sensible _ a priori _ on the relative strength of recombination lines , such as those from the balmer series .",
    "the mpa - jhu group have addressed some of these issues ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , refining the absorption - line strength measurements for sdss galaxies and leading to many useful studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , in the case of both these databases , it is not clear how systematic problems may have affected the extraction of the physical parameters listed in these catalogues , and it is not always possible to verify the quality of these measurements themselves . in this paper",
    "we attempt to further improve both the absorption and emission - line spectroscopic measurements of nearby sdss galaxies , as well as providing an assessment of the quality of our fit to both the stellar and nebular spectral components of our sample galaxies .",
    "this helps to isolate objects with problematic data or systems that can not be described by our set of physical assumptions and which may thus contain additional structures .",
    "for instance , in this paper we will show how such a quality assessment will reveal a previously unidentified population of objects with broad balmer lines .",
    "similar inspections may help finding the presence of other additional features such as the typical `` bump '' at 4640  associated to the presence of wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a systematic mismatch in the nad region around 5900  due to the presence of neutral material entrained in galactic outflows ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it is with the hope of fostering the potential discovery of such peculiar systems that we enable the community to inspect each of our fits with the sdss galaxies considered in this study .",
    "this work , unlike the other databases , adopt both theoretical stellar population synthesis model @xcite and empirical stellar templates @xcite to improve accuracy of the fit . besides",
    ", we treat nebular emission which affects all over the optical wavelengths including  doublet that is not considered by mpa - jhu group .",
    "dramatic effect of  doublet subtraction on mgb absorption line strength is described in   [ sec : abs_measurements ] .",
    "specifically , our sample includes the entire sdss dr7 spectroscopic database of objects that the sdss pipeline identified as `` galaxies '' , which we restricted by imposing a redshift cut below @xmath11 .",
    "this yielded a total of 661,400 galaxies .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , we describe our method for deriving the absorption and emission line measurements , which includes extracting the central stellar and gas kinematics . in ",
    "[ sec : quality ] we explain how we assessed the quality of our fit in both the stellar continuum and the nebular emission , and explain how to identify and deal with objects with broad balmer lines .",
    "the structure of our new database is then described in ",
    "[ sec : database ] , with   [ sec : comparison ] containing the details of how our measurements for the stellar kinematics , the emission - line fluxes and widths , and the strength of absorption - line features compare with the same quantities from the sdss dr7 pipeline or the mpa - jhu dr7 catalogue . as an example of the improvements made by using our procedure , at the end of ",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we discuss how accounting for the presence of the weak  emission can impact estimates of the element abundances in galaxies .",
    "finally , we present a number of stacked spectra for different hubble types and discuss how they can be useful to galaxy studies in   [ sec : stack ] and give a summary of our work in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in order to measure the stellar and gaseous kinematics within the central regions of our sample galaxies and assess the depth of the most important stellar absorption - line features , as well as the strength of the nebular emission observed in the sdss spectra , we adopted a strategy very similar to that used during the ` sauron `  integral - field spectroscopic survey of nearby early - type galaxies @xcite , which dealt with more than 34,000 individual spectra .",
    "our analysis of the sdss spectra consisted of three separate steps .",
    "first , we extracted the stellar kinematics by directly matching the spectra with a set of stellar templates , while excluding the spectral regions potentially affected by nebular emission .",
    "we then measured the gaseous kinematics and assessed the strength of each emission - line by fitting the entire spectrum , simultaneously using the stellar templates that were broadened and shifted by the previously derived stellar kinematics and a set of gaussian templates representing the nebular emission .",
    "finally , we subtracted , from the sdss spectra , our best model for the nebular emission and measured the strength of various stellar absorption lines from the observed spectra following standard line - strength index definitions . an early application and description of this fitting strategy can be found in @xcite and @xcite .      to measure the stellar kinematics from the sdss spectra in our catalogue ,",
    "we used cappellari & emsellem s ( 2004 ) pixel - fitting method , known as ` ppxf ` , and parameterized the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) by means of a simple gaussian , thus obtaining only the galaxy redshift @xmath10 and central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath12 . during the ` ppxf `  fit , we used the @xcite stellar population models used by @xcite , which we combined with a number of empirical stellar templates based on the miles stellar library @xcite .",
    "the use of the miles library helps with matching absorption - line features dominated by alpha - enhanced elements ( see  2.4 ) . before extracting the central losvd in our sample galaxies",
    ", we also needed to define the spectral regions used during the ` ppxf `  fit .",
    "this means setting the wavelength range of the fit , excluding the spectral regions potentially affected by nebular emission , masking the regions where the skylines at 5577 , 6300 , and 6363(in the rest frame ) may have left substantial residuals after their subtraction , and finally excluding the nad@xmath13 absorption lines that were not properly matched by the stellar templates owing to the impact of interstellar absorption .",
    "the wavelength range of the ` ppxf `  fit was set by the spectral coverage of our templates , which is restricted to 6800  owing to the presence of the miles templates , and the redshift estimate provided by the sdss for each object , which also helped with the placement of a 1,200 -wide mask ( for emission - lines with a velocity dispersion of 200 ) centered around the expected position of each of the lines listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : emission ] . during the ` ppxf `  fit",
    ", we used a 4@xmath0-order additive polynomial correction for the spectral slope of our templates .",

    "[ tab : absorption ] belong . whether our line - strength measurements were based on the original emission - line cleaned spectra or on their degraded counterparts ( in our catalogue we provide both values ) , we corrected our index values for the impact of stellar kinematic broadening . to achieve this effect , we observed how the values of the indices changed when we measured them on the optimal combination of the stellar templates returned by the ` gandalf `  fit ( @xmath35 ) and on the best stellar model obtained during the same process ( @xmath36 ) , which is the optimal template convolved by the losvd obtained during the ` ppxf `  fit and further adjusted for dust reddening by ` gandalf ` .",

    "although this may produce an over - subtraction of the nebular flux and result in somewhat biased values of the absorption - line indices , we prefer this to introducing a sudden step in the index infill correction by not subtracting the emission when crossing a certain detection threshold .",
    "moreover , when the skylines fall within the pseudocontinuum or index passbands of one of our indices , which can happen for different indices at different redshifts , we provided the @xmath35 value that is measured on the stellar optimal template .",
    "the residuals of an imperfect subtraction of such skylines may lead to meaningless values for the indices if these were measured directly on the sdss data .      as briefly mentioned at the beginning of this section",
    ", the templates based on the stellar population models from bruzual & charlot(2003 ) can not fully describe the stellar spectrum of our sample galaxies .",
    "this is particularly true in cases of the most massive or the closest objects in our sample , where the sdss spectra probe overall or central stellar populations that display an overabundance of alpha - elements , which are not currently accounted for by the population models .",

    "furthermore , the resulting description of the stellar continuum would not necessarily be physically motivated , which in turn could lead to biased emission - line results and a wrong infill correction for the absorption - line indices .",
    "on the other hand , following @xcite we could select a number of sdss spectra of objects totally devoid of nebular emission to construct , with the stellar library , a more limited number of semi - empirical alpha - enhanced templates . more specifically , using an initial subsample of our catalogue , we drew a number of passive galaxies covering a range of values for the stellar velocity dispersion , to trace the galaxy mass , and for the ratio of the mgb and fe5015 absorption - line indices , to trace the degree of alpha - enhancement ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . using ` ppxf",
    "`  we then matched each of these spectra with the entire miles stellar library from @xcite , without masking the emission - line regions and while employing only multiplicative polynomials to adjust the shape of the stellar templates .",
    "the quality of such a fit is generally excellent , thanks to the large number of templates , to the extent that the resulting optimal combinations of the stellar spectra used in each of these fits could , in practice , be regarded as a galactic spectrum deconvolved from the line - of - sight kinematical broadening .",
    "such optimal templates were then themselves combined into 12 empirical templates and designed to cover , as evenly as possible , the distribution of the fitted galaxies in the @xmath12-mgb / fe5015 space .",

    "both the ` ppxf `  and ` gandalf `  returned formal errors for the stellar and gaseous kinematics and the flux values of the fitted emission lines . from montecarlo simulations based on synthetic spectra created from our best ` gandalf `  fit to a subsample of galaxies in our catalogue and the formal uncertainties of their sdss spectra , we verified that the formal uncertainties were consistent with the scatter of the parameter estimations obtained from fitting the synthetic spectra .",
    "errors on the line - strength indices for each single object in our database would be more cumbersome to compute . in fact , although the impact of the statistic uncertainties on the flux densities of the sdss spectra could be easily described in terms of formal errors in the line indices , the knock - on effect of the uncertainties on the stellar kinematics and - most importantly - on the ` gandalf `  emission - line fit would require a montecarlo simulation in order to be properly estimated .",
    "since this is not viable for nearly 700,000 objects , we decided instead to attach to any given line - index measurement in the objects of our catalogue the typical uncertainty that is measured in spectra showing a similar quality , a similar stellar kinematic broadening and strength of the emission falling in the pseudo - continuum of index passband of the considered index . to derive such typical errors , we selected a large number of sdss spectra covering a wide range in quality ( quantified by the average value of the s / n ratio between the values of the flux density and the statistical sdss errors on them ) , of values of the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath12 , and - within similar s / n and @xmath12 values - of strength for the emission possibly affecting the line indices ( e.g. ,  for fe5015 ) .",
    "the strength of the emission lines was quantified by the ratio a / rn of the best fitting amplitude a of the considered line and the level of scatter rn in the residuals of the ` gandalf `  fit . based on our best ` gandalf `  fit for these objects and the formal sdss errors on the flux densities , we created a number of synthetic spectra with a slightly different kinematic broadening and nebular emission , as allowed by the formal uncertainties on the ` ppxf `  and ` gandalf `  parameters , and re - ran our entire analysis on them to obtain new values for the line - indices .",
    "by re - matching each of these synthetic spectra and subsequently measuring the line - strength index after subtracting our best model for the nebular emission , we obtained a range of absorption - line strength values and the corresponding 1@xmath39-errors .",
    "the scatter of such synthetic line - index values around the one measured on the original spectra provided us with the typical errors on the line - strength measured in our catalogue .",
    "[ error ] shows how their values vary as a function of s / n , @xmath12 and - when applicable , the a / n of the contaminating lines . furthermore , despite the presence of nebular emission , the error budget in the absorption - line indices is chiefly dominated by the quality of the spectra themselves .",

    "first , before the strength of the absorption features were assessed at the end of our procedure , the first two steps of our analysis were repeated in order to optimize our ` gandalf `  fit . in particular , once the position and the width of the lines were measured the first time , we repeated the ` ppxf `  fit by placing a better emission - line mask on only the region where some emission was found .",
    "this makes us more confident in the stellar kinematics , in particular for galaxies with little or no emission or in star - forming objects where the balmer absorption lines are the predominant feature in the stellar spectrum and can not be properly matched unless the mask around the balmer emission lines - generally narrower than the absorption lines - is properly adjusted .",
    "a better stellar kinematic leads to a better ` gandalf `  fit .",
    "a second point to keep in mind is that the second component for the dust extinction used in the ` gandalf `  fit - that affecting only the nebular spectrum - should only be considered reliable in the presence of balmer lines , and thus of an observed balmer decrement . if no balmer lines are detected , or if only  is , then the de - reddened values for the fluxes of all the lines fitted by ` gandalf `  will also be very uncertain , and one should only use the observed fluxes . finally , we stress that even in the presence of a balmer decrement in a good quality spectrum , the values of the diffuse component for the reddening - approximated as a uniform screen affecting the entire galaxy spectrum - may to some extent be degenerate with the particular ` gandalf `  choice for the stellar templates .",
    "determining the star - formation history and the exact values of the reddening in our sample galaxies is beyond the scope of this catalogue , however , and here we are interested mostly in providing the best physically motivated and accurate description of the stellar and nebular spectrum , in order to provide reliable values for the stellar and gas kinematics , for the emission - line fluxes and for the infill - corrected absorption - line indices .",
    "assessing the quality of our fits to the sdss spectra is a key to the accuracy of our measurements for the stellar and gaseous kinematics , as well as for the strengths of both the emission and absorption lines .",
    "an inadequate model for the observed spectrum , or artificial features in the data themselves is likely to introduce biases to the measured parameters that are not accounted for by our formal errors .",
    "such parameters are affected in different ways by data mismatches . for the stellar kinematics , and in particular for the velocity dispersion ,",
    "the most crucial match is the stellar continuum across the entire wavelength range , whereas the accuracy of the emission - line parameters ( and of the absorption - line indices that are affected by nebular emission ) are more sensitive to the quality of the fit in more localized spectral regions around the emission lines .",
    "the quality of the data , as routinely estimated by dividing the average level of the flux density ( hereafter s , for signal ) by the level of the formal uncertainties for the latter ( hereafter sn , for statistical noise ) , does not guarantee a good fit .",
    "artifacts introduced during data reduction may not be picked up by such an s / sn ratio , whereas a severe template mismatch to the stellar continuum or the presence of additional components in the nebular spectrum ( e.g. , a broad line region or wolf - rayet features that are not included in our standard fitting procedure ) may lead to biased results , even in a case of excellent data . a more direct way to assess",
    "the quality of our model would be to compare the level of fluctuations in the fit residuals ( hereafter rn , for residual noise ) to the expected statistical fluctuations , sn .",
    "a rn / sn ratio close to unity indicates a good fit , as this ration corresponds to a reduced @xmath177 , which is also close to 1 .      in order to assess the quality of the fit to the stellar continuum and",
    "help in isolating biased measurements for the stellar kinematics , we measured the rn / sn ratio in four different wavelength regions of equal width that were devoid of nebular emission .",
    "specifically , we adopted the 4500  4700 , 5400  5600 , 6000  6200  and 6800  7000  wavelength intervals and combined the corresponding values for the rn / sn ratio into a single average , excluding the largest value in order to avoid a spurious contribution of continuum bands , where the sdss spectra happened to be broken .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] , for @xmath346000 randomly selected sdss galaxy spectra , the distribution of the rn / sn average values for the fit to the stellar continuum as a function of the quality of the spectrum itself , as measured by the s / sn ratio , measured and averaged in the same continuum bands .",
    "the vast majority of the spectra were well matched by our model , with rn / sn close to unity .",
    "our ability to match the data also appears to have improved as the quality of the spectra increased .",
    "in fact , for data of excellent quality ( high s / sn ) , the level of fluctuation in the fit residual became even smaller than the formal uncertainties in the flux density , suggesting that the latter errors must under - predict the real level of statistical fluctuations in the sdss spectra in such high - quality regimes .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] also shows a few representative examples of ` gandalf `  fits to the the sdss spectra .",
    "as stated above , the quality of the data themselves does not guarantee success or failure in the fit .",
    "it is possible to have formally good fits , both in cases of data with good and relatively poor values for the s / sn ratio ( orange and blue examples ) , whereas our model did not necessarily fail only in a case of poor data ( red example ) , but also when the quality was very good ( green example ) .",
    "in general there are three reasons that our objects show rn / sn ratios that are significantly above unity .",
    "most often a poor fit to the continuum is the result of the presence of a conspicuous broad line region ( grey examples , lower panels ) , which was not noticed by the sdss pipeline in the process of separating the galaxy from the qso spectra .",
    "although the presence of broad line regions ( blr ) can be accounted for by ` gandalf `  ( see   3.3 ) , in the framework of our standard recipe that includes only narrow - line regions , the presence of an additional component leads to a considerable mismatch outside the wavelength regions near the  and  lines .",
    "a second kind of failure occurs for objects in which the adopted stellar library appears to be inadequate in matching the observed sdss spectrum ( dubbed as `` bizarre '' in fig .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] and already shown in the red and green examples ) .",
    "this occurs in a very small fraction of objects ; however , it often appears the spectra have been contaminated by features in the sky foreground . finally , for a third kind of spectra , a high rn / sn value is the result of telluric atmospheric features at the red end of the spectra .",
    "when such features are present , the sdss formal errors underestimate the fluctuations around the stellar continuum introduced by the telluric features , biasing the rn / sn value in the 6800 - 7000 continuum band to high values .",
    "we note however , that in this case the fit to the rest of the spectrum is not necessarily poor .    having ascertained that the vast majority of our models showed good fits for the stellar continuum of the sdss spectra , we could assign , to any object with rn / sn above unity , a probability of being a true outlier ( in the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] ) , and hence a galaxy to which the stellar continuum has been poorly matched .",
    "for this we determined , as a function of the quality of the spectrum , the median of the rn / sn distribution and corresponding outlier - resistant standard deviation ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we used the rn / sn distributions in s / sn bins containing at least 100 objects ( see the inset of the central panel of fig .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] ) , which we determined using the voronoi binning scheme@xcite , and fitted the resulting median and sigma values ( red crosses ) with a polynomial function ( orange lines ) .",
    "we then computed the distance of each point from the median line in fig .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] , expressing its distance in units of sigma , n@xmath39 .",
    "since the rn / sn distributions in each s / sn bin were well matched by log - normal functions , such n@xmath39 value readily gave the probability of a point being a true outlier .",
    "for example , n@xmath39=3 indicated that there was a 99.73% probability that the object was a true outlier and only a 0.27% probability of being the result of random fluctuations .",
    "similar to the case of the stellar continuum , we needed to check the quality of the fit with the emission lines in order determine possible biases in the physical parameters we wanted to measure , such as the line width or fluxes .",
    "even when the nebular emission was clearly detected , it was possible that the underlying assumptions in our modeling approach were not met , due to the presence of a broad line region or to non - gaussian line profiles , for example .    in order to assess the quality of the emission - line fit using the previous approach",
    ", it was important to give as much weight as possible to the deviations that arose only in the spectral regions around the nebular emission , and to adopt , for the wavelength interval where the rn / sn ratio was computed , a width that scaled with the width of the lines .",
    "indeed , if we were to evaluate the rn / sn ratio over a fixed number of sampling elements , at a given fit quality the deviations from the fits of lines of very different widths would contribute unevenly to the rn / sn budget , thus limiting our ability to spot bad fits in the case of narrow lines .",
    "for each emission line we thus computed rn / sn around the line within a passband of width equal to five times the gas velocity dispersion @xmath178 . to then assess the quality of an emission - line fit in a given object ,",
    "we normalized the distance from the median line in the rn / sn vs. s / sn diagram using the @xmath179 value ( at a given s / sn ) that would be found if all of the rn / sn and s / sn ratios had been measured with passbands of identical widths corresponding to the value of the @xmath178   observed in the object of interest .",
    "such a @xmath179 was found by simply rescaling the @xmath179 values obtained using a fixed bandwidth , corresponding , for instance , to the typical value of @xmath178  found in the sdss galaxies ( @xmath180 ) . for a good fit ,",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations around the median value for the rn / sn ratio ( at a given data quality or s / sn value ) scaled simply with the square root of the number of sampling elements used in computing the rn / sn ratio .",
    "there was a second complication in assessing the quality of the emission - line fit . even for systems with similar line widths , evaluating the amplitude of the statistical fluctuations in the rn /",
    "sn ratio at a given data quality was difficult due to the presence of a larger fraction of formally bad fits compared to the case of the stellar continuum . put another way , it was more difficult to isolate the tail of the outliers when estimating the standard deviation in the rn / sn histograms for the emission - line fit . to circumvent this problem , for every line that we wanted to check in terms of the quality of our fit",
    ", we defined a continuum passband in its immediate vicinity and used the rn / sn vs. s / sn distribution for this passband to determine the reference rn / sn median and sigma profiles that were actually used to assess the quality of each fit . as previously mentioned , such profiles were derived by adopting for the continuum passband a single width , which was set to five times the typical @xmath178  value in the sdss galaxies , or approximately 90 .",
    "[ qa_emission ] illustrates how this procedure works for the specific case of the  emission line .",
    "the left panel shows , for the same @xmath346000 galaxies shown in fig .",
    "[ qa_continuum ] , the rn / sn vs. s / sn distribution for the  fit , adopting for each object a bandwidth equal to five times @xmath181}$ ] . in this panel , we show the positions of three objects with similar values of the rn / sn ratio around the  line , but with different @xmath181}$ ] values , as indicated by the size of the symbols .",
    "if the median and @xmath179 profiles could be drawn in this panel and used to assess the quality of the  fit in these objects , we would have been led to believe that the goodness of the emission - line fit degrades as we move from left to right , to higher s / sn values .",
    "this is not quite the case , as illustrated by the central panel .",
    "this panel shows the rn / sn vs. s / sn distribution obtained in the continuum passband adjacent to the  line , centered at 5006.7  and adopting a width equal to five times 90 .",
    "the dashed and solid black lines show the median rn / sn values and the level where the objects are one @xmath179 away from the median , respectively ( using the same method as for the continuum fit ) . for lines that are considerably broader than 90",
    "the statistical fluctuations around the median ought to be considerably smaller since a broader passband containing a larger number of sampling elements was adopted .",
    "conversely , the quality of the fit for much narrower lines should be compared against a higher bar .",
    "this is illustrated by the coloured solid lines in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ qa_emission ] , which shows the level where objects with the same @xmath181}$ ] of the three considered examples should lie when found one @xmath179 away from the median rn / sn line .",
    "when such yardsticks are used to express the distance from the median in terms of @xmath182 values , although the object with highest s / sn ratio ( green point ) lies further away from the median line , due to its narrower  line , the quality of its ` gandalf `  fit was not much worse than in the case of the galaxy with the worse data ( lowest s / sn , light blue ) and was much better than for the object with the broadest  lines ( light green ) . using this quality - assessment scheme , the right - hand panel shows how the goodness of our emission - line fit can be illustrated ( albeit only for a small number of objects for the sake of clarity ) , by colour - coding each point in the rn / sn vs. s / sn diagram for the  line according to the @xmath182 values derived in the rn / sn vs. s / sn diagram for the continuum band adjacent to .    typically , formally bad emission - line fits occur either in the presence of strong lines where even small deviations from a gaussian profiles lead to high rn / sn values , or in the presence of an additional blr component .",
    "non - gaussian lines can have a double - horned shape .",
    "for instance , in the case of the balmer lines , tracing star - formation activity confined to a circumnuclear ring can show blue or red wings , presumably due to out or inflows of gaseous material , or , can display the triangular voigt profile that is typical of strong agn activity .",
    "our gaussian fit could lead to biased measurements for the position of the lines with blue or red wings , and to an overestimation of the width of the true thermal component in lines with a voigt profile .",
    "our flux estimates , on the other hand , are not heavily affected by the presence of non - gaussians profiles .",
    "this is not the case , however , for objects with an additional blr component , in particular when ` gandalf `  chooses to match the broad lines rather than the narrow component of the balmer spectrum .",
    "since the blr fluxes can greatly exceed the flux of the narrow balmer lines , when these objects are plotted on standard bpt diagrams , such as the /  vs. /  diagram , they can be easily spotted in regions with very low values for the /  or /  ratio that are not occupied by other galaxies with well - matched nebular spectra from agns or star - forming regions ( refer to the following section ) .",
    "conversely , no object with a non - gaussian profile ends up in similarly strange regions of the bpt diagrams .      in the previous two subsections",
    ", we argued that the presence of a broad - line region frequently causes a bad fit to both the emission lines and the stellar continuum , in particular near the  and  lines . yet , provided that the presence of a blr is automatically spotted , the impact of such a component on the ` ppxf `  extraction of the stellar kinematics and the subsequent ` gandalf `  fit to both the stellar continuum and nebular lines can be easily dealt with . in fact",
    ", one needs only to add a second series of broader balmer lines in the ` gandalf `  setup to place a broader mask around to balmer lines during the ` ppxf `  fit and then include the blr component in the ` gandalf `  fit .    in order to recognize the presence of blr",
    ", we looked for a `` shoulder '' in the continuum region adjacent to the +  region , which would otherwise be relatively flat .",
    "for this , we computed the ratio between the flux levels observed in two spectral regions of equal width on the blue side of the +  blend .",
    "the first was placed as close as possible to the  ( avoiding any flux from this line even for the broadest narrow - line region , @xmath183 ) , and the second was located just beyond the extent of the broadest blr ( centering it on the blue side of the 6594  absorption line that is predominantly due to calcium and iron ) .",
    "then , similar to our quality - assessment procedures , once such flux ratio was measured in a given object , we simply checked to determine if it was exceptionally high compared to the distribution of other flux ratios in spectra of similar quality .",
    "[ ex_blr ] shows two examples of spectra with blr components and how our procedure isolated them .",

    ", we visually inspected the spectra and the residuals of the standard ` gandalf `  fit for 10,000 randomly chosen objects , labeling those where we recognized the presence of a blr . adopting a 3@xmath39 cut to isolate exceptionally high values for the previously defined flux ratio , our procedure selected 83% of the blr that we identified by eye , while wrongly deeming likely the presence of a blr in 0.8% of the objects where we had found none .",
    "although these figures are quite encouraging , it must be acknowledged that only the strongest blr regions can be identified if the s / sn is small(i.e . , poor - quality spectra ) .",
    "even then , such blr components appear in a non - negligible fraction of the sdss spectra of nearby galaxies , as overall we found 8,610 objects with a blr component out or the entire dr7 sample , or almost 1.3% of the galaxies .    as mentioned in   4.2 , the impact of a failed ` gandalf `  fit due to a blr can be crucial when classifying the nebular emission with standard bpt diagrams .",
    "in fact , when the ` gandalf `  algorithm opts to fit the blr region within our standard prescription , the object will move to a strange region in the bpt diagram , below and to the left of the area occupied by the star - bursting systems . adding a blr component in the ` gandalf `  fit rectifies this problem , and usually moves the narrow - line components of these galaxies back to the regions of the bpt diagram that are occupied by active galactic nuclei , either seyfert nuclei or low - ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ) .",
    "such a correction was particularly evident when considering a sample of objects that rarely showed signs of central star formation , such as early - type galaxies .",
    "[ bpt_blr ] shows an area occupied by the early - type galaxies in our dr7 sample ( as morphologically classified in   7.2 ) in the standard /  vs. /  diagnostic diagram , as well as the position of those objects where we spotted the presence of blr , before and after adding a blr component in the ` gandalf `  fit , in the left and right panels , respectively .",
    "for the vast majority of the objects with a blr , our procedure failed to match the narrow +  lines in the standard ` gandalf `  fit and they resided in the lower left side of the bpt diagram .",
    "if we properly dealt with the blr component , however , they generally moved to the region occupied by seyfert nuclei .",
    "our measurements of the stellar and nebular kinematics , for the strength of both the emission lines and the stellar absorption features , for the diffuse and nebular reddening components , as well as our assessments of the quality of the fit to the stellar continuum and each of the emission lines , formed a rather complicated database . to facilitate distribution",
    ", we decided to organize our ` ppxf ` , ` gandalf `  and absorption - line index measurements in idl structures , which allowed us to group all the emission- and absorption - line quantities .",
    "such structures were then saved in single fits files for each of the objects in our public catalogue .",
    "these files can be queried for single or multiple objects by their sdss i d , galaxy coordinate and redshift via a web interface , or can be downloaded in single archive . for the case of single objects , we also provide a second fits file showing the ` gandalf `  fit to the object of interest .",
    "the output parameters in the idl structures are organized following the logical order of our fitting procedure .",
    "first we found the ` ppxf `  outputs , the stellar redshift @xmath184 and velocity dispersion @xmath12 ( in ) .",
    "these are followed by the nominal quality of the spectra and of our fit in the continuum , as quantified by the s / sn and rn / sn ratios introduced in  4.1 , which relate to the probability that the fit is biased by some artificial or unaccounted feature , as given by the n@xmath185 parameter .",
    "negative n@xmath185 values occur when the rn / sn ratio are below the median value , and always indicate a good fit .",
    "next are the ` gandalf `  emission - line measurements , which we provide for all of the lines listed in tab.[tab : emission ] , in addition to the  line . for each line",
    "we list the observed and de - reddened fluxes ( in @xmath186 ) , the equivalent width of the line ( in negative   values ) , the a / n ratio that relates to how well a line is detected (   2.2 ) , and the n@xmath185 value ( as defined in a  4.2 ) . the strength of the lines and our ability to match them",
    "is then followed by the redshift and width of the recombination and forbidden lines ( labelled as @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189}$ ] , @xmath190}$ ] ) as well as by the value of the interstellar reddening @xmath191 , which includes a second , nebular component @xmath192 , when the balmer decrement is detected (   2.2 ) .",
    "the presence of a blr is also flagged at this point .",
    "although no detection cut based on the a / n values was applied to the emission - line measurements , these should be deemed unreliable when little or no emission is detected .",
    "last , but not least , are the absorption - line measurements for each of the indices listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : absorption ] , measured in  .",
    "it is most likely that only the objects with sdss of the best quality ( e.g. , @xmath193 ) would prove useful .",
    "all the previously listed redshift , velocity dispersion , flux , equivalent width and reddening values are also accompanied by their corresponding formal uncertainties . in some cases , due to the presence of sky lines or gaps and artifacts in the sdss spectra ,",
    "the values of the parameters can diverge , in which case they are flagged .",
    "we provide our entire database ( line strengths , quality assessments , fitting sed ) at .",
    "there are two existing databases of sdss dr7 data with which we can compare our own measurements .",
    "the first consists of the sdss dr7 pipeline outputs , and the second comes from the mpa - jhu release of dr7 spectral measurements . as in previous releases , the sdss dr7 pipeline does not remove the nebular emission prior to the absorption - line measurements , so we expected biases in cases of considerable ionised - gas emission . on the other hand , by following the method of tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the mpa - jhu measurements were based on a procedure that is similar to ours , whereby the nebular contribution to the spectra and the corresponding absorption - line infill was carefully treated .",
    "yet , from the description of the mpa - jhu database , we determined some technical differences between their procedure and the method adopted here which proved important for interpreting possible discrepancies with our measurements .",
    "for instance , we measured the emission - line fluxes while simultaneously matching the stellar continuum and the nebular emission with ` gandalf ` , whereas the mpa - jhu emission - line measurements were carried out on the residuals of a previous fit to the stellar continuum , presumably while masking the regions affected by emission , which we did when extracting the stellar kinematics with ` ppxf ` .      with the data in fig .",
    "[ sigma_comparison ] , we began by comparing , for the same subsample of randomly drawn @xmath346000 objects used in fig .",

    "[ qa_emission ] , our ` ppxf `  velocity dispersion @xmath194 measurements with the corresponding values from both the sdss dr7 and mpa - jhu databases .",
    "the overall agreement between the various measurements was good , although our @xmath194 values appeared to follow more closely the sdss dr7 data than the mpa - jhu .",
    "this occurred , in particular , at the low-@xmath194 regime , which is inhabited mostly by relatively faint spiral galaxies showing considerable amounts of nebular emission .",
    "in fact , at the very low @xmath194 end of our sample the presence of emission caused most of the sdss dr7 measurements to fail , and whereas the mpa - jhu catalogue reports @xmath194 values for these objects , in most cases their values exceed ours .",
    "the large scatter in this regime can be explained by considering the low s / sn ratio of the spectra for such faint spirals , but such a bias can not be easily explained .",
    "it is worthy of note , however , that based on simulations similar to those presented in   2.5 , and featuring sdss spectra for both very old and young stellar populations , we found the ` ppxf `  can recover @xmath194 values that scatter evenly around the input values down to @xmath195  and s / sn = 10 .",

    "we further corrected the dr7 fluxes for foreground galactic extinction to bring them in line with our and the mpa - jhu measurements , and brought the mpa - jhu fluxes back to their original values before the renormalisation for extended sources .",
    "our line - width and flux measurements agreed fairly well with the dr7 measurements ( fig .",
    "[ emission_width_comparison_dr7 ] ) , in particular when the lines were strong and thus the manner by which the stellar continuum was accounted for should have had only a very limited impact on the emission - line width and flux estimation based on the gaussian fits .",
    "still , even at these regimes our  flux values appear to exceed the dr7 measurements by a few percent .",
    "furthermore , as we consider weaker lines , the way the  flux measurements compared to each other appeared to be systematically biased , rather than being simply affected by a larger scatter due to larger relative errors on the measurements of weak lines in both the dr7 and our dataset , as seems to be the case for  and .",
    "our flux values became systematically larger than the dr7 measurements as the  lines become weaker , which is to be expected given that we accounted for the presence of the underlying stellar spectrum and that in this regime the strength of the  emission became comparable to its corresponding stellar absorption feature .",
    "no such bias as a function of the emission - line strength was observed when we compared our  flux values with the mpa - jhu measurements , which do account for the stellar continuum ( fig .  [ emission_width_comparison_mpa ] ) , although our intrinsic  line - width values were larger than the mpa - jhu estimates . from the limited information provided with the mpa - jhu on - line catalog , it is difficult to understand the cause of such small deviations ; however , in the strong - emission regime where the flux estimates should be consistent between all three databases , our values were in agreement with the dr7 values , whereas the mpa - jhu measurements were not .",
    "we conclude this section by presenting fig .",
    "[ dr7_comparison ] and fig .",
    "[ mpa_comparison ] , where we compare our line - strength measurements with the values for the same lick indices provided by both the dr7 pipeline and the mpa - jhu catalogue .",
    "the dr7 release webpages specify that the dr7 measurements were made on the original sdss spectra , without degrading their resolution to match the resolution of the lick / ids system .",
    "furthermore , a first inspection of the objects with good quality spectra and that were completely devoid of emission revealed that this was also the case for the mpa - jhu measurements and that in both cases no attempt was made to correct the line - strength measurements for the impact of kinematic broadening .",
    "the central panels of fig .",
    "[ dr7_comparison ] and fig .",
    "[ mpa_comparison ] show how , for passive objects , our uncorrected measurements were well - matched with both catalogues .    when objects with emission are considered , however , the dr7 values ( fig .  [ dr7_comparison ] ) were heavily biased for the lick indices where an emission line could fall either in the index passband or within the adjacent regions that were used to estimate the level of the pseudo - continuum above the absorption line region .",
    "in fact , during the dr7 pipeline analysis , the nebular emission was not subtracted prior to the line - strength measurements .",
    "when the emission - line fell within the index passband , as happened for the  and  lines in the case of the  and fe5015 indices ( top and central panels of fig .",

    "[ mpa_comparison ] ) , the strength of the absorption line was under - estimated .",
    "when the emission fell in one of the continuum passbands , as happened for the  doublet in the case of the mgb index ( lower panels ) , the line - strength was over - estimated , as it was measured against an artificially enhanced pseudo - continuum level ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the mpa - jhu line - strength measurements tended to agree with ours in the presence of nebular emission , as they were also corrected for line - infill ( fig .",
    "[ mpa_comparison ] , top and middle panels for  and fe5015 ) .",
    "yet , the mpa - jhu catalogue does not include several of the emission lines that are present in our catalogue , such as the  doublet , which explains why disagreement between the mgb measurements still persists ( fig .",
    "[ mpa_comparison ] ( lower panels ) ) .    as a final remark",
    ", it should be noted that the necessary correction for the impact of kinematic broadening can be quite severe in the most massive galaxies with correspondingly high values for the central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs , in particular , for the case of indices , such as fe5015 and mgb , that were typically used to estimate the metallicity of the degree of @xmath18-enhancement of stellar populations , for which not accounting for kinematic broadening would lead to an underestimation of their values .",
    "when we considered that the mpa - jhu measurements for the mgb index could have been over - estimated in the presence of  emission , we note that using the mpa - jhu values could lead to over - estimated values of the mgb / fe5015 ratio , which is a useful gauge of @xmath18-enhancement ( @xcite ) .          to give an example of the potential extent of this problem , we considered two different subsamples : one comprising spiral galaxies displaying nebular emission , and a second including only quiescent early - type galaxies .",
    "these objects were morphologically selected as described in the following section and , after applying our standard @xmath196 and @xmath197 requirement for strong lines in order to pick active and quiescent objects ( in addition to requiring the detection or not of  emission ) , we assembled 311 and 579 objects for spirals and early - type galaxies , respectively . adopting an indicative luminosity - weighted age of 2 and 10 gyr for the stellar populations of these two classes of galaxies , we compared the position of ours and the mpa - jhu measurements for the iron and magnesium sensitive @xmath40fe@xmath198 and mgb indices to the grids of @xcite to determine stellar population models of varying metallicities and overabundance of @xmath18 elements , such as magnesium(fig .",
    "[ tmb03 ] ) . for the case of passive objects ( right panel ) , the 1-@xmath39 contours for the distribution of ours and the mpa - jhu measurements overlapped well and indicated an @xmath18 enhancement with respect to the solar values of the @xmath199 $ ] ratio .",
    "on the other hand , for the case of spirals ( left panel ) , not accounting for the presence of the  lines led to an overestimation of the mgb/@xmath40fe@xmath200 ratio , and therefore an abundance of @xmath18 elements in the central regions of spiral galaxies which , from our database , would seem to have solar abundances .",
    "large - scale spectroscopic surveys , such as sdss , have made it possible to create spectral templates for galaxies of various kinds and morphological classes , which can be used as inputs in sed fitting routines where optical template spectra are needed , such as in photometric redshift codes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we conclude our work by providing new spectral templates for galaxies of different hubble types , obtained by combining the results of our spectral fits for a subsample of 452 morphologically selected objects . as they represent the average spectral energy distribution of galaxies of a given hubble type , these templates should be well - suited for photometric redshift estimates based on broad - band fluxes as long as the target galaxies appear to have a relaxed morphology . the spectral variations with narrower wavelength ranges , due for instance to the impact of a different mass on the strength and width of stellar and nebular features , will be the subject of future investigations based on larger parent sample for the stacked templates that could be selected , for instance , with less stringent morphological or redshift criteria .",

    "<S> we present a new database of absorption and emission - line measurements based on the entire spectral atlas from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) 7@xmath0 data release of galaxies within a redshift of 0.2 . </S>",
    "<S> our work makes use of the publicly available penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) and gas and absorption line fitting ( gandalf ) idl codes , aiming to improve the existing measurements for stellar kinematics , the strength of various absorption - line features , and the flux and width of the emissions from different species of ionised gas . </S>",
    "<S> our fit to the stellar continuum uses both standard stellar population models and empirical templates obtained by combining a large number of stellar spectra in order to fit a subsample of high - quality sdss spectra for quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our fit to the nebular spectrum includes an exhaustive list of both recombination and forbidden lines . </S>",
    "<S> foreground galactic extinction is implicitly treated in our models , whereas reddening in the sdss galaxies is included in the form of a simple dust screen component affecting the entire spectrum that is accompanied by a second reddening component affecting only the ionised gas emission . in order to check for systematic departures from the rather standard set of assumptions that enters our models , we provide a quality assessment for our fit to the sdss spectra in our sample , for both the stellar continuum and the nebular emissions and across different wavelength regions . </S>",
    "<S> this quality assessment also allows the identification of objects with either problematic data or peculiar features . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to foster the discovery potential of our database ; therefore , our spectral fit is available to the community . </S>",
    "<S> for example , based on the quality assessment around the  and  lines , approximately 1% of the sdss spectra classified as `` galaxies '' by the sdss pipeline do in fact require additional broad lines to be matched , even though they do not show a strong continuum from an active nucleus , as do the sdss objects classified as `` quasars '' . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide new spectral templates for galaxies of different hubble types , obtained by combining the results of our spectral fit for a subsample of 452 morphologically selected objects .    </S>"
