    "ever since the seminal work of kramers on the diffusion model of chemical reactions was published about half a century ago @xcite , the theory of activated processes has become a central issue in many areas of science @xcite , notably in chemical physics , nonlinear optics and condensed matter physics .",
    "kramers considered a model brownian particle trapped in a one - dimensional well representing the reactant state which is separated by a barrier of finite height from a deeper well signifying the product state .",
    "the particle was supposed to be immersed in a medium such that the medium exerts a frictional force on the particle but at the same time thermally activates it so that the particle may gain enough energy to cross the barrier . over several decades the model and",
    "many of its variants have served as standard paradigms in various problems of physical and chemical kinetics to understand the rate in multidimensional systems in the overdamped and underdamped limits @xcite , effect of anharmonicities @xcite , rate enhancement by parametric fluctuations @xcite , the role of non - gaussian white noise @xcite , role of a relaxing bath @xcite , quantum and semiclassical corrections @xcite to classical rate and related similar aspects .",
    "the vast body of literature has been the subject of several reviews @xcite and monograph @xcite .",
    "the common feature of overwhelming majority of the aforesaid treatments is that the system is thermodynamically closed which means that the noise of the medium is of _ internal _ origin so that the dissipation and fluctuations get related through the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "however , in a number of situations the system is thermodynamically open , i.e. , when the system is driven by an _ external _ noise which is _ independent _ of system s characteristic damping @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of the dynamics in this case is the absence of any fluctuation - dissipation relation . while in the former case",
    "a zero current steady state situation is characterized by an equilibrium boltzmann distribution , the corresponding situation in the latter case is defined only by a steady state condition , if attainable .",
    "it may therefore be anticipated @xcite that the independence of fluctuations and dissipation tends to make the steady state distribution function depend on the strength and correlation time of external noise as well as on the dissipation of the system .",
    "the elucidation of the role of this steady state distribution in rate theory is worth - pursuing .",
    "our aim in this paper is to generalize kramers theory of activated processes for external noise in this context .",
    "we thus allow the brownian particle in a potential field to be driven by both external and internal stationary and gaussian noise fluctuations with arbitrary decaying correlation functions .",
    "the external noise may be of thermal or non - thermal type .",
    "we consider the stochastic motion to be spatial - diffusion - limited and calculate the rate of escape over the barrier in the intermediate to strong damping regime within an unified description .",
    "the theory we develop here follows closely the original flux over population method of farkas @xcite .",
    "the distinctive aspect , however , is the consideration of a steady state distribution instead of the equilibrium boltzmann distribution for determination of quasi - stationary population in the source well .",
    "this affects the generalized rate expression significantly in two ways .",
    "first , the dynamics around the bottom of the source well exhibits the dependence of steady state distribution on the dissipation .",
    "second , the rate expression remains valid even in absence of any internal thermal noise .",
    "we mention , in passing , that the former point had earlier been rightly emphasized by melnikov @xcite as a specific requirement for a general theory .",
    "some pertinent points regarding the rate theory for nonequilibrium systems may be in order .",
    "it is wellknown that though thermodynamically closed systems with homogenous boundary conditions possess in general time - independent solutions , the driven or open systems may settle down to complicated multiple steady states @xcite when one takes into account of nonlinearity of the system in full .",
    "secondly in most nonequilibrium systems the lack of detailed balance symmetry gives rise to severe problem in determination of stationary probability density for multidimensional problem @xcite . because of its one - dimensional and linearized description the present treatment is free from these difficulties .",
    "it is important to point out that the externally generated nonequilibrium fluctuations can bias the brownian motion of a particle in an anisotropic medium and may used for design of molecular motors and pumps @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium , non - thermal systems has also been investigated by a number of worker in different contexts , e.g. , for examining the role of colour noise in stationary probabilities @xcite , the properties of nonlinear systems @xcite , the nature of cross - over @xcite , the effect of monochromatic noise @xcite , the rate of diffusion - limited coagulation processes @xcite , etc .    the outlay of the paper is as follows : in sec.ii we generalize kramers theory of reaction rate for external noise .",
    "the stationary , gaussian noise processes are of both external and internal type with arbitrary decaying correlation functions . a general form of steady state distribution function in the source well and a rate expression for barrier crossing dynamics for the nonequilibrium open system have been pointed out . in sec.iii",
    "we explicitly calculate the detailed form of the rate expressions for the specific cases .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec.iv .",
    "we consider the motion of a particle of unit mass moving in a kramers type potential @xmath0 such that it is acted upon by random forces @xmath1 and @xmath2 of both internal and external origin , respectively , in terms of the following generalized langevin equation @xmath3    where the friction kernel @xmath4 is connected to internal noise @xmath1 by the wellknown fluctuation - dissipation relationship @xcite @xmath5    we assume that both the noises @xmath1 and @xmath2 are stationary and gaussian .",
    "their correlation times may be of arbitrary decaying type .",
    "the external noise is independent of the memory kernel and there is no corresponding fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we further assume , without any loss of generality , that @xmath1 is independent of @xmath2 so that we have @xmath6    the external noise modifies the dynamics of activation in two ways .",
    "first , it influences the dynamics in the region around the barrier top so that the effective stationary flux across it gets modified .",
    "second , in presence of this noise the equilibrium distribution of the source well is disturbed so that one has to consider a new stationary distribution , if any , instead of the standard boltzmann distribution .",
    "this new stationary distribution must be a solution of the generalized fokker - planck equation around the bottom of the source well region and serve as an appropriate boundary condition analogous to kramers problem .",
    "we consider these two aspects separately in the next two subsections .",
    "we consider the potential @xmath0 as shown in fig.1 . linearizing the potential around the barrier top at @xmath7 we write @xmath8",
    "thus the langevin equation takes the following form @xmath9    where @xmath10    the general solution of eq.([eq5 ] ) is given by , @xmath11    where @xmath12    with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the initial position and velocity of the brownian particle that are assumed to be nonrandom , and @xmath15    the kernel @xmath16 is the laplace inversion of , @xmath17    with @xmath18    the time derivative of eq.([eq7 ] ) gives @xmath19    with @xmath20    and @xmath21    now using the symmetry of the correlation function , @xmath22    we compute the explicit expressions of the variances in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath23 as ,    @xmath24 ^ 2   \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 \\int_0^t m_b(t_1 ) \\ ; dt_1 \\int_0^{t_1 } m_b(t_2 ) \\ ; c(t_1 - t_2 ) \\ ;   dt_2 \\ ; \\ ; , \\\\",

    "m_b(t_2 ) \\ ; c(t_1 - t_2 ) \\ ; dt_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and from ( 14a ) and ( 14c ) we see that @xmath25    while calculating the variances it should be remembered that by virtue of eq.([eq6 ] ) @xmath26    since , in principle we know all the average quantities and variances of the linear system driven by gaussian noise one can make use of the characteristic function method to write down the fokker - planck equation for phase space distribution function @xmath27 near the barrier top @xcite @xmath28 p(x , v , t ) & = & \\bar{\\gamma}_b ( t ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v } v p(x , v , t )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\phi_b(t ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v^2 } p(x , v , t ) + \\psi_b(t ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v \\partial x } p(x , v , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath29    regarding the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq16 ] ) three points are to be noted . first , although bounded the time dependent functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 may not always provide long time limits .",
    "these play a decisive role in the calculation of non - markovian kramers rate .",
    "therefore , in general , one has to work out frequency @xmath33 and friction @xmath34 functions for analytically tractable models @xcite .",
    "second , when the noise is purely internal ( i.e. , there exist a fluctuation - dissipation relation ) we have @xcite @xmath35 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    third , for pure external noise with markovian relaxation , i.e. , @xmath36 we have @xmath37      in order to calculate the stationary distribution near the bottom of the left well we now linearize the potential @xmath0 around @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding fokker - planck equation can be constructed using the above - mentioned technique to obtain @xmath39 p(x , v , t ) & = & \\bar{\\gamma}_0 ( t ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v } v p(x , v , t )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\phi_0(t ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v^2 } p(x , v , t ) + \\psi_0 ( t ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v \\partial x } p(x , v , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath40    here the subscripts ` 0 ' signifies the dynamical quantities corresponding to the bottom of the left well .",
    "it may be easily checked that the stationary solution of eq.([eq20 ] ) is given by @xmath41\\ ] ]    where , @xmath42 ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the values at long time limit and @xmath46 is the normalization constant . here",
    "@xmath47 is the renormalized linearized potential with a renormalization in its frequency .",
    "it must be emphasized that the distribution ( [ eq22 ] ) is not an equilibrium distribution .",
    "this stationary distribution for the open system plays the role of an equilibrium distribution for the closed system which may be however recovered in the absence of external noise terms .",
    "we also point out in passing that because of the linearized potential @xmath48 the steady state is unique and the question of multiple steady states does not arise .      in the spirit of kramers celebrated ansatz @xcite we now demand a solution of the eq.([eq16 ] ) at the stationary limit of the type @xmath49 \\ ; \\xi ( x , v)\\ ] ]    with @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the long time limits of the corresponding time dependent quantities specific for the barrier top region .",
    "the notable difference from the kramers ansatz is that the exponential factor in ( [ eq23 ] ) is not the boltzmann factor but pertains to the dynamics at the barrier top .",
    "the ansatz of the form ( [ eq23 ] ) denoting the steady state distribution is motivated by the local analysis near the bottom and top of the barrier in the kramers sense . for a nonequilibrium system , as in the present problem of external time - dependent potential field ,",
    "the relative population of the two regions , in general , depends on the global properties of the potential .",
    "thus although at equilibrium the probability density is given by a boltzmann distribution , the external modulation of the potential requires energy input and drives the system away from equilibrium , disturbing the boltzmann distribution . at this point",
    "one may anticipate the signature of dynamics in the kramers-like ansatz ( [ eq23 ] ) compared to the standard kramers ansatz for closed system ( i.e. , when the external field is absent ) .",
    "thus while in the latter case one considers a complete factorization of the equilibrium part ( boltzmann ) and the dynamical part , @xmath52 , the ansatz ( [ eq23 ] ) incorporates the additional dynamical contribution through dissipation and the strength of the noise into the exponential part .",
    "this explicit dynamical modification of kramers ansatz in the form of ( [ eq23 ] ) is valid so long as the extra dynamical contribution in the exponential factor in ( [ eq23 ] ) does not become too severe , i.e. , the amplitude of the external noise field is not too strong . to put it in a more quantitative way ,",
    "this implies ( assuming for simplicity @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) that the thermal length scale , i.e. , the maximum value of @xmath55 on which the velocity of the particle is thermalized , should be shorter than the other characteristic length scales of the system , e.g. , @xmath56    these considerations are necessary for making spatial diffusion regime and quasi - stationary condition meaningful in the present context .    now inserting ( [ eq23 ] ) in ( [ eq16 ] ) in the steady state",
    "we get @xmath57 \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial v } +   \\phi_b \\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi}{\\partial v^2 } + \\psi_b \\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi}{\\partial v \\partial x } = 0 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    at this point we set @xmath58    and with the help of the transformation ( [ eq25 ] ) , eq.([eq24 ] ) is reduced to the following form @xmath59 \\frac{d \\xi}{d u } = 0 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    now , let @xmath60    where @xmath61 is a constant to be determined later .    from ( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) we have @xmath62    with @xmath63    by virtue of the relation ( [ eq27 ] ) , eq.([eq26 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath64    where @xmath65    the general solution of the homogenous differential equation ( [ eq30 ] ) is @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the constants of integration .",
    "the integral in the eq.([eq32 ] ) converges for @xmath69 if only @xmath70 is positive .",
    "the positivity of @xmath70 depends on the sign of @xmath71 ; so by virtue of eqs.([eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) we find that the negative root of @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 guarantees the positivity of @xmath70 since @xmath73    to determine the value of @xmath67 and @xmath68 we impose the first boundary condition on @xmath74 @xmath75    this condition yields @xmath76    inserting ( [ eq35 ] ) into ( [ eq32 ] ) we have as usual @xmath77 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    since we are to calculate the current around the barrier top , we expand the renormalized potential @xmath47 around @xmath78 @xmath79    thus with the help of ( [ eq36 ] ) and ( [ eq37 ] ) , eq.([eq23 ] ) becomes @xmath80\\ ] ]    with @xmath81    now defining the steady state current @xmath82 across the barrier by @xmath83    we have using eq.([eq38 ] ) @xmath84 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]      having obtained the steady state current over the barrier top we now look for the value of the undetermined constant @xmath68 in eq.([eq41 ] ) in terms of the population in the left well .",
    "we show that this may be done by matching two appropriate _ reduced _ probability distributions at the bottom of the left well .",
    "to do so we return to the eq.([eq23 ] ) which describes the steady state distribution at the barrier top . again with the help of ( [ eq36 ] ) we have @xmath85 \\ ; \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{v^2}{2d_b } - \\frac { \\tilde{v}(x)}{d_b+\\psi_b } \\right ] \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    we first note that , as @xmath86 , the pre - exponential factor in @xmath87 reduces to the following form @xmath88 = f_2 \\ ; \\left ( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda } \\right ) ^{1/2 } \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    we now define a reduced distribution function in @xmath89 @xmath90    hence we have from ( [ eq44 ] ) and ( [ eq45 ] ) @xmath91 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    similarly we derive the reduced distribution function in the left well , around @xmath92 using ( [ eq22 ] ) as @xmath93\\ ] ]    where we have employed , the expansion of @xmath48 as @xmath94    and @xmath46 as the normalization constant .    at this juncture",
    "we impose the second boundary condition that , at @xmath95 the reduced distribution function ( [ eq46 ] ) must go over to stationary reduced distribution function ( [ eq47 ] ) at the bottom of the left well .",
    "thus we have @xmath96    the above condition is used to determine the undetermined constant @xmath68 in terms of the normalization constant @xmath46 of eq.([eq22 ] ) @xmath97 \\ ;   \\exp \\left [    \\frac { \\tilde{v}(0 ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{\\omega}_b^2 x_a^2 } { d_0+\\psi_0 } \\right ] \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    evaluating the normalization constant by explicitly using the relation @xmath98    and then inserting its value in ( [ eq50 ] ) we obtain @xmath99 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    making use of the relation @xmath100 in ( [ eq52 ] ) and then the value of @xmath68 in eq.([eq41 ] ) we arrive at the expression for the normalized current or barrier crossing rate @xmath101 \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    where the activation energy @xmath102 is defined as @xmath103    as shown in fig.1 . since the temperature due to internal thermal noise , the strength of the external noise and damping constant are buried in the parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath43 , @xmath51 and @xmath70 the general expression ( [ eq53 ] ) looks somewhat cumbersome .",
    "we note that the subscripts ` 0 ' and ` b ' in @xmath106 or @xmath107 refer to the well or the barrier top region , respectively .",
    "we discuss it in greater detail in the next section .",
    "eq.([eq53 ] ) is the central result of this paper .",
    "this generalizes the kramers expression for rate of the activated processes for the nonequilibrium open systems .",
    "both the internal and the external noises may be of arbitrary long correlation time .",
    "it is important to note that the pre - exponential dynamical factors as well as the exponential factor are modified due to the openness of the system .",
    "the modification of the exponential factor is due to the fact that depending on the strength of the external noise @xmath2 the system settles down to a stationary distribution which does not coincide with the usual equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",
    "the system therefore attains the steady state at a different ` effective ' temperature .",
    "this aspect will be clarified in greater detail when we consider the limiting case in subsection d. in general , both the factors in the rate depend on the strength of the noise , correlation time of fluctuations of both external and internal noise processes and dissipation .",
    "the rate is spatial - diffusion - limited and is valid for intermediate to strong damping regime .",
    "this validity must be appreciated in the present context of driven system in the sense that while on the one hand thermal length scale of the system must be short compared to other characteristic length scales of the sytem corresponding to the inequality ( [ eq71 ] ) , dissipation should also obey the restriction that during one round trip of the particle in phase space ( in action , angle space ) under purely deterministic motion corresponding to ( [ eq1 ] ) , the energy dissipated is greater than the thermal energy , i.e. , @xmath108    where @xmath109 , the action , is equivalent to unperturbed energy @xmath102 in the weak friction limit .",
    "both the inequalities ( [ eq71 ] ) and ( [ eq72 ] ) are therefore relevant for quantifying the spatial - diffusion - limited intermediate to strong damping regime . in what follows we",
    "shall be concerned with several limiting situations to illustrate the general result ( [ eq53 ] ) systematically for both thermal and non - thermal activated processes .",
    "we first consider the case with no external noise and the internal thermal noise is @xmath110-correlated . to this end",
    "we set @xmath111    making use of the abbreviations in eqs.(17 ) and ( 21 ) it follows after some algebra that @xmath112    the above relations reduce the general expression ( [ eq53 ] ) to classical expression for kramers rate @xcite @xmath113 \\ ; e^{-e / k_bt } \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]      next we consider the case with no external noise but the internal noise is of ornstein - uhlenbeck type @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath114    here @xmath115 denotes the strength while @xmath116 refers to the correlation time of the noise . again from eqs.(17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 21 ) along with ( [ eq56 ] ) we derive the following relations @xmath117 \\ ; \\ ; { \\rm and } \\\\",

    "e^{-e / k_bt } \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    whereby we recover the result of grote - hynes @xcite and hnggi - mojtabai @xcite obtained several years ago .",
    "next we consider the case where the noise is completely due to of external source and the external noise is of ornstein - uhlenbeck type @xcite so that we set @xmath119    note that since in this case the dissipation is independent of fluctuations we may assume markovian relaxation so that @xmath36 ( see also eqs.(18 ) and ( 19 ) ) .    the above condition ( [ eq58 ] ) when used in eqs.(17 ) , ( 19 ) and ( 21 ) we obtain after some lengthy algebra @xmath120   \\ ; \\ ; { \\rm and } \\\\ a_\\pm = \\frac{1}{1+\\gamma \\tau_c } \\ ; \\left [ - \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\pm \\sqrt { \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4 } + \\omega_b^2 } \\right ] \\ ; \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the rate becomes @xmath121 \\ ;   \\exp \\left [ - \\frac { \\gamma ( 1+\\gamma \\tau_c - \\omega_b^2 \\tau_c^2 ) } { { \\cal d } ( 1 + \\gamma \\tau_c ) } e \\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that the expression ( [ eq59 ] ) denotes the external noise - induced barrier crossing rate which crucially depends on the strength @xmath115 and correlation time @xmath116 of the coloured noise .",
    "the absence of temperature and the appearance of dissipation @xmath122 explicitly demonstrates the non - thermal origin of the noise processes as well as the absence of fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we finally consider both the internal and external noise to be @xmath110-correlated , i.e. , @xmath123    @xmath124 being the strength of the external white noise .",
    "hence , by virtue of ( 15 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 21 ) we have @xmath125    hence the rate becomes @xmath126 \\ ;   \\exp \\left [ \\frac{e } { k_bt + ( \\alpha/\\gamma ) } \\right ] \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath127 we recover the kramers original result ( [ eq55 ] ) for pure internal white noise .",
    "we note here that @xmath128 defines a new ` effective ' temperature due to external noise .",
    "the effective temperature which depends on the strength of the external noise had been discussed earlier by bravo et .",
    "@xcite in a somewhat different context .",
    "we note that while in the latter case the bath is driven by external fluctuations , the present treatment concerns the direct driving of the reaction co - ordinate by external noise .",
    "in this paper we have generalized kramers theory of activated processes for nonequilibrium open systems .",
    "the theory takes into account of both internal and external gaussian noise fluctuations with arbitrary decaying correlation functions in an unified way .",
    "the treatment is valid for intermediate to strong damping regime for spatial diffusive processes .",
    "\\(i ) we have shown that not only the motion at the barrier top is influenced by the dynamics , it has an important role to play in establishing the stationary state near the bottom of the source well for the open systems .",
    "thus the stationary distribution function in the well depends crucially on the correlation time of the external noise processes as well as on damping .",
    "this is distinctly a different situation ( but analogous ) as compared to an equilibrium boltzmann distribution in the source well for standard kramers theory for closed systems .",
    "\\(iii ) we have checked and examined the various limits of the generalized rate expression to obtain kramers rate , its non - markovian counterpart as well as the other cases for specific external noise processes in presence and absence of the internal noise .",
    "we conclude by noting that since the validity of the rate expression derived in the paper depends on the existence of long time limit of the moments for the stochastic processes , the theory can not be directly extended to , say , fractal noise processes .",
    "these and the related noise processes remain outside the scope of the present treatment .",
