    "since the seminal work of tutte  @xcite maps and graphs on 2-dimensional surfaces have become widely studied combinatorial objects in discrete mathematics . the enumerative and structural problems around maps , i.e.  _ embedded _ graphs on a surface , are relatively well settled .",
    "starting from the number of planar maps computed by tutte  @xcite , the number of rooted maps on surfaces was found by bender , canfield , and richmond  @xcite and other classes of maps were extensively enumerated since then .",
    "such enumeration results have been used to study typical properties of random maps on surfaces , e.g.  the size of the largest components by banderier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "another important aspect of maps is that they allow nice bijections to the so - called _ well - labeled _ trees .",
    "the bijection between planar maps and the well - labeled trees was first studied amongst others by schaeffer  @xcite , which was extended by bouttier , di francesco , and guitter  @xcite to maps on an orientable surface with positive genus .",
    "these bijections are the corner stone of profound results on the topological structure of scaling limits of random maps by chassaing and schaeffer  @xcite , le gall  @xcite , and schramm  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , analogous problems related graphs that are _ embeddable _ on a surface are still wide open .",
    "the enumerative properties of random planar graphs have attracted much attention since the work of mcdiarmid , steger , and welsh  @xcite who studied random labeled planar graphs with a given number of vertices .",
    "let @xmath7 be the number of labeled planar graphs on @xmath1 vertices .",
    "mcdiarmid , steger , and welsh  @xcite showed amongst other results that the quantity @xmath8 converges to a limit @xmath9 as @xmath10 , which is called the growth constant .",
    "an upper bound @xmath11 , based on the triangulations and probabilistic methods , was obtained by osthus , prmel , and taraz  @xcite .",
    "a lower bound @xmath12 was given by bender , gao , and wormald  @xcite who studied the number of labeled 2-connected planar graphs through the singularity analysis of generating functions arising from the decomposition of graphs along connectivity .",
    "using a similar method gimnez and noy  @xcite proved that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are explicitly computable constants ( e.g.  @xmath15 ) .",
    "as for the number @xmath16 of graphs embeddable on a surface with positive genus , mcdiarmid  @xcite showed that its growth constant is the same as that of planar graphs while chapuy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found @xmath16 for all orientable surfaces of positive genus @xmath17 proving that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath9 is the growth constant of the labeled planar graphs .",
    "mcdiarmid and reed  @xcite studied various typical properties of random graphs on surfaces , e.g.  subgraph containment and maximum degree .",
    "frieze  @xcite asked about the asymptotic behavior of the number @xmath20 of labeled planar graphs on @xmath1 vertices with @xmath2 edges .",
    "note first that if @xmath21 for some @xmath22 , then a typical graph with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges is planar , i.e. @xmath23 ( cf .  @xcite or @xcite ) gerke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved the existence of its growth constant , in the sense that for @xmath24 with @xmath25 , the quantity @xmath26 converges to a limit @xmath27 as @xmath10 .",
    "the asymptotic formula for @xmath24 was found by gimnez and noy  @xcite who showed that for @xmath28 , there are analytic constants @xmath29 such that @xmath30 . in this paper",
    "we deal with the case when @xmath31 .",
    "note that for such @xmath32 @xmath33 i.e. , @xmath34 , and a ` naive ' generating function approach does not lead to the asymptotic formula for @xmath20 .",
    "we use @xmath20 to study the asymptotic behavior of the uniform random planar graph @xmath0 by which we mean a graph chosen uniformly at random among all labeled planar graphs with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges ; thus , each of these graphs occurs as @xmath0 with probability @xmath35 . from the results in",
    "@xcite it follows that if @xmath36 is bounded away from both @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then @xmath0 has a well ordered structure , for instance , it has a large component of size @xmath39 , and all planar graphs of finite size appear as its subgraphs .",
    "thus , it corresponds to late stages of the evolution of the standard uniform random graph @xmath40 , the graph chosen uniformly at random among all graphs with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges .",
    "our goal is to study the typical size and structure of components in @xmath0 in a more interesting range , when @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that , somewhat surprisingly , @xmath0 exhibits two critical ranges , which occur at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the first critical period corresponds to a phase transition phenomenon observed in the plethora of different random graph models .",
    "let us recall some results on one of the most widely used random graph model @xmath40 .",
    "it follows from the papers of erds and rnyi @xcite , bollobs  @xcite , uczak  @xcite , uczak , pittel , and wierman  @xcite , janson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and janson  @xcite ( see also janson , uczak , and ruciski  @xcite ) that the giant component ( i.e.  the unique largest component ) suddenly emerges at @xmath4 , and nowadays this spectacular phenomenon is well studied and understood . if @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then , a.a.s .",
    "( i.e.  with probability tending to 1 as @xmath1 approaches @xmath44 ) @xmath40 consists of isolated trees and unicyclic components , and the largest component is a tree of size @xmath45 . on the other hand , if @xmath46 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath40 contains exactly one component with more edges than vertices of size @xmath47 , while all other components are of size @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath49 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath40 contains a topological copy of @xmath50 and thus it is not planar , while , as we have mentioned , for @xmath51 , a.a.s .",
    "@xmath40 consists of isolated trees and unicyclic components , so it is clearly planar .",
    "another random structure relevant to the behavior of @xmath0 is the uniform random forest @xmath52 ( i.e.  a forest chosen uniformly at random among all labeled forest with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges ) .",
    "uczak and pittel  @xcite found that although the giant component in @xmath52 emerges at @xmath4 , as for @xmath40 , the critical behavior of these two models are somewhat different .",
    "let @xmath42 . if @xmath51 , then the structure of both @xmath52 and @xmath40 are similar ; in particular , the size of the largest tree in @xmath52 is a.a.s .",
    "however in the supercritical phase , when @xmath49 , the giant tree of @xmath52 is a.a.s .  of size @xmath53 , which is roughly half of the size of the largest component of @xmath40 , while the second largest tree of @xmath52 is of size @xmath3 which does not depend much on @xmath54 provided @xmath55 , i.e.  it is by far larger than the second largest component of @xmath40 for @xmath56 , which is of size @xmath57 .    in the paper",
    "we show that as far as @xmath42 , where @xmath49 and @xmath58 is bounded away from @xmath59 , the behavior of @xmath0 is similar to that of @xmath52 .",
    "namely , a.a.s .",
    "the size of the largest complex component is of the order @xmath53 , while the second largest component has @xmath3 vertices .",
    "however , unlike in the case of @xmath52 for which @xmath60 , for @xmath0 we may have @xmath61 , so the rate of growth of the size of complex components must change at some point .",
    "we prove that it occurs when @xmath5 , more precisely , if @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then the complex components of @xmath0 have a.a.s .",
    "@xmath64 vertices altogether , while for @xmath65 they contain @xmath66 vertices for some computable constant @xmath67 .",
    "let us mention that the condition @xmath68 is a result of the proof method we have used and most likely can be replaced by @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , our method can say quite a lot about structure of the largest component very much in the spirit of uczak  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the main idea of our argument .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : cubicplanar ] we present the first analytic ingredient of the proof : counting specially weighted cubic planar multigraphs using generating functions . here",
    "we also describe how to use this result to bound the number of planar multigraphs with minimum degree three .",
    "then , in the next section , we estimate the number of planar graph with @xmath70 vertices and @xmath71 edges in which each component has more edges than vertices .",
    "finally , in the main chapter of this paper , we use a direct counting to study the number @xmath20 and the asymptotic properties of @xmath0 for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "as we have already mentioned most of results concerning the asymptotic behavior of @xmath20 is based on the generating function method .",
    "thus , for @xmath72 , one can study the function @xmath73 and deduce the asymptotic behavior of @xmath24 from the behavior of @xmath74 near its singularities .",
    "note however that since @xmath75 for @xmath76 , the coefficients in the expansion of @xmath74 tend to zero too fast to be handled by standard methods of generating function analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the condition that a graph is planar is very hard to grasp by purely combinatorial means .",
    "thus , in the paper we use a combination of analytic and combinatorial tools . from a planar graph",
    "we extract its kernel , which is its only part responsible for the planarity and is dense enough to be treated by generating functions method",
    ". then we use a technically involved but rather natural counting argument to find asymptotic properties of @xmath0 .    in order to make the above description precise ,",
    "we introduce some definition .",
    "the _ excess _",
    "@xmath77 of a graph @xmath78 is the difference between the number of its edges and the number of its vertices .",
    "we call components of a graph with positive excess , i.e.those which have at least two cycles , _ complex _ components , and we say that the graph is complex if all its components are complex .",
    "the core of a graph @xmath78 , denoted @xmath79 , is the maximal subgraph of @xmath78 with the minimum degree two .",
    "the kernel of @xmath78 , denoted by @xmath80 , is obtained from the core by removing all isolated cycles and replacing each path whose internal vertices are all of degree two by an edge .",
    "note that for a graph @xmath78 the kernel is a multigraph which can have multiple edges and loops .",
    "however , the excess of both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the same .",
    "note also that @xmath80 has clearly the minimum degree three .",
    "if @xmath80 is cubic , we say that @xmath78 is _",
    "clean_. we define the _ deficiency _ @xmath81 of @xmath78 as the sum of degrees of vertices of @xmath80 minus three times the number of vertices of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , a graph is clean if and only if its deficiency is zero .",
    "our argument is based on a simple observation that @xmath78 is planar if and only if @xmath80 is planar .",
    "we use analytic methods to count the number of possible candidates for the kernel , and then follow purely combinatorial argument . to this end , in section  [ sec : cubicplanar ] we apply the singularity analysis to extract the asymptotic number of possible clean kernels of the planar graphs ( theorem  [ thm : cubic - asymptotics ] ) .",
    "the proof is similar to that used in the case of counting cubic planar graphs presented in bodirsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but in order to find the number of all planar graphs , we need to count cubic planar multigraphs with some special weight function dependent on the number of loops and multiple edges of a multigraph .",
    "then , we use a simple combinatorial idea to generalize our estimates to the number of kernels with non - zero deficiency .",
    "in the remaining part of our argument we follow an idea from uczak  @xcite ( see also janson , uczak , and ruciski  @xcite ) and construct complex planar graphs @xmath78 from their kernels .",
    "thus , we first choose the kernel , then put on its edges vertices of degree two obtaining the core of the graph , and add to it a forest rooted on vertices of the core .",
    "this procedure lead to the estimate given in theorem  [ thm : complex ] .",
    "we also remark that such a typical complex planar graph on @xmath70 vertices consists of large component and , perhaps , some small components of combined excess @xmath82 .    finally , in the main part of the paper we count the number of planar graphs by splitting it into a complex planar graph , the number of which we have just found , and the part which consists of isolated trees and unicyclic components , whose number is well known ( see britikov  @xcite ) .",
    "we compute @xmath20 for different values of @xmath83 . at the same time",
    ", we get information on the typical structure of @xmath0 such as the size of the largest component , its excess , and core .",
    "in this section we study the family of cubic planar weighted multigraphs , which plays a crucial role in studying the kernel of a random planar graph .",
    "we then consider the family of ` supercubic ' planar graphs that are planar weighted multigraphs with minimum degree at least three and a positive deficiency , which is indeed the set of possible kernels of complex planar graphs .      in this section",
    "we count the number of all labeled cubic planar weighted multigraphs , where each multigraph with @xmath84 loops , @xmath85 double edges , and @xmath86 triple edges gets weight @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "let @xmath89 be the number of all labeled @xmath70-vertex connected cubic planar weighted multigraphs on @xmath1 vertices and @xmath90 be the corresponding exponential generating function defined by @xmath91 note that @xmath92 for odd @xmath1 and also for @xmath93 except that we set @xmath94 by convention .",
    "it is well - known ( e.g.  @xcite ) that @xmath95    the function @xmath96 is defined by the following system of equations : @xmath97 this system of equations is obtained by following the lines of sections 36 in bodirsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where cubic planar _",
    "simple _ graphs were studied , so below we just outline the argument .",
    "the starting idea is that given a connected cubic planar weighted multigraph @xmath78 , we select an arbitrary edge @xmath98 in @xmath78 and orient the edge @xmath98 , to obtain a _ rooted _ counterpart @xmath99 .",
    "more precisely , the rooted cubic graph @xmath100 obtained from a connected cubic multigraph @xmath101 consists of @xmath101 and an ordered pair of adjacent vertices @xmath54 and @xmath102 . the oriented edge @xmath103 is called the root of @xmath99 . denote by @xmath104 a graph obtained from @xmath99 by deleting the root of @xmath99 .",

    "a graph on 2 vertices in the family @xmath116 enumerated by @xmath117 ( which is indeed a triple edge , one of which is oriented ) gets a weight 1/2 when it is used as a building block , but 1/6 when used as an isolated component .",

    "recall that a graph is called complex if all its components have positive excess . in this section ,",

    "as before , from  ( [ eq : heur1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : heur2 ] ) we infer that @xmath467 and @xmath468 note that when @xmath469 is large , then , clearly , @xmath470 , and the error term @xmath471 in ( [ eq : heur3 ] ) is equal to the main term @xmath472 . in order to compute this ` threshold value ' of @xmath102 one should use ( [ eq : heur4 ] ) and substitute to it @xmath470 and @xmath473 .",
    "it gives @xmath474 as the threshold value for the property that @xmath475 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath419 , then we have @xmath476 , as stated in theorem  [ thm : secondrange](i ) , while for @xmath63 , we have @xmath470 and , by ( [ eq : heur4 ] ) , @xmath477 , which agrees with theorem  [ thm : secondrange](iii ) .    since for @xmath478 , where @xmath76 , the random graph @xmath0 is a.a.s .  quite sparse ( see theorem  [ thm : middle ] ) , while for @xmath479 , @xmath480 , it is quite dense ( e.g.  a.a.s .",
    "it contains a copy of any given planar graph ) , it seems that the most interesting period in the evolution of @xmath0 is for @xmath481 .",
    "this intuition is confirmed by theorem  [ cor : mid ] , but clearly a lot remains to be done .",
    "for instance , it seems that the correct threshold function for the property that @xmath392 is @xmath482 , more precisely , we conjecture that the following holds .    * conjecture * _ if @xmath483 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath397 , while if @xmath484 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath485 and so @xmath392 .",
    "_    let us briefly justify the above claim that @xmath391 emerges in @xmath0 when @xmath482 .",
    "first of all , in order to have a single copy of @xmath391 in @xmath0 we need a lot of copies of @xmath391 in the kernel of the largest component of @xmath0 . the number of copies of @xmath391 in the kernel should be of the same order as the number of vertices of degree four in the kernel , which , in turn , is expected to be of the order of deficiency of the graph .",
    "once we have a copy of @xmath391 in the kernel , the probability that after placing vertices of the core at the edges of the kernel none of these vertices will be put at one of six edges of @xmath391 is @xmath486 .",
    "hence , if our estimates for @xmath487 and @xmath488 from theorem  [ thm : secondrange](iii ) remain valid for all values of @xmath2 such that @xmath489 , then the expected number of copies of @xmath391 s in @xmath0 is of the order @xmath490 thus , this number is bounded away from zero for @xmath491 .",
    "let us also add a few words on the models of random planar graphs different from @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most natural one is the graph obtained by the random planar process , when we add to an empty graph on @xmath1 vertices @xmath2 edges one by one each time choosing a new edge uniformly at random from all pairs which preserve planarity of the graph ( see gerke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in this model",
    "the structure of components is similar to that of a standard graph @xmath492 for an appropriately chosen @xmath493 .",
    "another model of random planar graph is the binomial random graph @xmath494 , when we look at properties of @xmath495 conditioned on the fact that it is planar .",
    "equivalently , one can view @xmath494 as the graph chosen from the family @xmath496 of all planar graphs on @xmath1 vertices in such a way that each @xmath497 appears as @xmath494 with the probability @xmath498 where @xmath499 denotes the number of edges of @xmath78 , and @xmath500 since clearly for every property @xmath501 @xmath502 once we determine the typical number of edges in @xmath494 the problem of finding properties of @xmath494 reduces to studying these properties for @xmath0 . from the estimates of @xmath20 given in theorems  [ thm : subcritical][thm : middle ] and [ thm : secondrange ] it follows that if @xmath503 then a.a.s .  @xmath494 has @xmath504 edges ; if @xmath505 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath506 ; for @xmath507 we are in the second critical period , i.e.  a.a.s .",
    "@xmath5 ; finally for @xmath508 we have a.a.s .  @xmath509 . note that a large part of the evolution of @xmath494 , when @xmath510 , corresponds to the period of evolution of @xmath0 when @xmath386 which , as we have already remarked , is crucial for many properties of @xmath0 .",
    "another interesting model is a random cluster model @xmath511 on planar graphs when for every labeled planar graph with vertex set @xmath160 $ ] we put @xmath512 where @xmath513 is a parameter , @xmath514 stand for the number of components in @xmath78 , and @xmath515 is the normalizing factor . in a similar way",
    "one can define @xmath516 adding factors @xmath517 to the right hand sides of  ( [ eq : c:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : c:2 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the additional cluster factor @xmath517 in , say , the standard model @xmath495 leads to an interesting phenomena such as the discontinuous phase transition which occurs in @xmath518 for @xmath519 ( cf .",
    "luczak and uczak  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , no such event can be observed in the planar case .",
    "the evolution of @xmath511 is quite similar to that of @xmath520 .",
    "the reason is quite simple : the giant complex component of @xmath0 is very sparse until it reaches the size @xmath402 and so the number of components is always close to @xmath521 and , as calculations show , can not be influenced much by the presence of the additional factor @xmath517 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath516 does not depend very much on the value of @xmath522 either except for the scaling : the number of edges of @xmath516 is roughly the same as for @xmath523 .",
