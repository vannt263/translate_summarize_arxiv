    "the electron transport through nanometric conductors attract a huge interest due to constant shrinkage of microelectronic devices.@xcite in particular , metal nanowires ( nw ) display interesting quantum conductance behavior even at room temperature.@xcite from a practical point of view , nw s can be easily generated by putting in contact two metal surfaces , which are subsequently pulled apart . during the nw elongation and just before rupture , the conductance displays flat plateaus and abrupt jumps , which for metals such as au , take a value of approximately one conductance quantum @xmath0 = 2@xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the electron charge and @xmath3 is planck s constant ) .    in spite of the simplicity of the experimental procedure , a new structure with a different evolution",
    "is observed for each nw generation and all conductance curves have plateaus and jumps , but they display disparate profiles.@xcite in order to overcome this difficulty , a simple statistical method has been usually applied to analyze the average behavior . instead of considering the conductance as a function of the elongation , the transport properties can be represented as a histogram of conductance occurrence , in such a way that a flat plateau generates a histogram peak.@xcite by linearly adding the histograms associated to each conductance curve , a global histogram is generated , which describes the general tendencies of an ensemble of nw s .",
    "the global histogram displays well defined peaks close to the integer multiples of the conductance quantum ; this fact has been adopted as a proof of the tendency to conductance quantization in metal nws.@xcite    the statistical method , discussed above , provides information on the average behavior but it hinders the study of nw transport properties .",
    "for example , it is not possible to get the detailed information on how structural factors influence the conductance evolution . for several years",
    ", the structure evolution was derived from molecular dynamics simulations , where the high computer cost imposes the use of simplified potentials based on effective medium theory ; @xcite subsequently free electron methods were applied to estimate the conduction of the metallic neck ( or confining potential ) .",
    "more precise methods , considering the electronic structure , have also been applied to calculate the nw conductance , but for static atomic configurations.@xcite    recently , _ in situ _ high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) experiments have provided a new insight in the field .",
    "for example , rodrigues _",
    "_ @xcite have showed that just before rupture , gold nw s are crystalline and free of defects and they assume only three kinds of atomic arrangements : two of them form bipyramidal constrictions which evolve to one - atom - thick contacts , while the other one generates rod - like nw s that break when they are rather thick ( three - to - four atoms ) . by considering that",
    "et al._@xcite have already shown that atom size contacts display a conductance of 1 @xmath0 , it is possible to discriminate between the rod - like and pyramidal nw morphologies .",
    "further , the relationship between each nw type and electrical transport measurements was obtained by simple crystallographic arguments .",
    "validation of the initial assumption was obtained by statistically comparing the occurrence of observed curve profiles .",
    "although these important developments mostly focused on the last conductance plateau , a quantitative understanding of the correlation between atomic structure and conductance during the nanowire stretching is still lacking . in this work , we have addressed the connection between gold nw structure and the quantized conductance behavior during the nw elongation .",
    "we have used hrtem to obtain the detailed information of the atomic structure evolution of gold nw s during stretching , and using crystallographic arguments , we proposed the three dimensional structure of these nanostructures .",
    "the nw conductance was measured using an independent , dedicated experimental set - up : a mechanically controlled break junction operated in ultra - high - vacuum ( uhv - mcbj ) . in order to correlate both sets of data ,",
    "we have used a semi - empirical atomistic theoretical technique based on the extended hckel theory@xcite ( eht ) that allows for the estimation of transport properties of systems with a large number of atoms.@xcite the results displayed an excellent agreement between observed structural and conductance experiments and theoretical calculations , enabling a complete modeling of the nw elongation process both from the structural and transport properties points of view .",
    "the remaining of this work is organized as follows : section [ experiment ] describes the experimental techniques used to obtain the structural and transport data , respectively ; section [ theory ] describes the theoretical model employed to calculate the electronic quantum transport through the metallic nw s ; the experimental results are presented in section [ expresul ] and the analysis of the data via theoretical analysis is presented in sections [ discuss1 ] for nw s oriented along the [ 100 ] , [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] directions as well as [ discuss2 ] , where the presence of impurities is investigated ; finally , in section [ conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we have generated nw s _ in situ _ in a hrtem ( jem 3010 uhr , operated at 300 kv , point resolution 1.7  ) using the method developed by takayanagi s group.@xcite the procedure consists in focusing the microscope electron beam ( current density 120 a/@xmath4 ) on the sample to perforate and grow neighboring holes until a nanometric bridge is formed between two of them .",
    "we have used a self - supported polycrystalline gold thin film ( 5 nm thick , deposited on a holey carbon grid ) in order to generate nw s between apexes of different orientations and elongate them in different directions.@xcite atomic resolution image acquisition has been performed after reducing the electron beam intensity to its usual value ( 30 a/@xmath4 ) .",
    "a high sensitivity tv camera ( gatan 622sc , 30 frames / s ) associated with a conventional video recorder was used to register nw real - time evolution . the procedure described above ,",
    "allows us to generate nw s with a remarkable stability , because the nw , its apexes and the surrounding thin film regions , form a monolithic block . in consequence ,",
    "the nw s formed by a few atomic layers usually show a long life time ( 1 - 10 minutes ) . despite this stability ,",
    "the generated nw s elongate spontaneously , get thinner and then break due to the relative slow movement of the nw apexes .",
    "these apexes displacement are probably due to a film deformation induced by thermal gradients between parts of the sample , as usually observed in tem thin film work . a critical aspect when studying such tiny nanostructures",
    "is the presence of contaminants , the most critical one in tem is amorphous carbon.@xcite however , we must keep in mind , that the intense electron irradiation transforms carbon into bucky - onions and finally clean the gold surface.@xcite    the electric transport properties of gold nw s were studied using an independent instrument specially designed for this purpose , namely an uhv - mcbj.@xcite in this approach , a macroscopic gold wire ( 99.99 @xmath5 pure , @xmath6 = 75 @xmath7 m ) is glued in a flexible substrate in two points ; then it is weakened in a point between the two fixing parts by an incomplete cut . by bending the substrate _ in situ _ in the uhv ,",
    "we break the wire and produce two clean gold surfaces ; using the same bending movement , the fresh tips are put together and separated repeatedly in order to generated and deform nw s .",
    "it s important to remark that in this configuration the nw s are generated from surfaces obtained in uhv ( @xmath8 10@xmath9 pa ) , so it is expected to have a clean sample for few hours.@xcite this care with vacuum conditions is extremely important to generate reliable experimental measurements on nw properties.@xcite    electrical measurements were done using a home - made voltage source , and current - voltage converter powered with isolated batteries to reduce electrical noise .",
    "data acquisition was based on an eight - bit digital oscilloscope ( tektronic tds540c , 2 gsample / s , bandwidth 500 mhz ) ; this electronic system was developed with the aim of improving the conductance measurement precision , yielding values with a relative error of ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 .",
    "the applied voltage was 100 mv , and the conductance was measured in the [ 0 , 2.8 ] @xmath13 range to improve the detection of the last two quantum conductance plateaus .",
    "we follow the approach introduced by emberly and kirczenow @xcite that is based on the extended hckel theory , which is a method traditionally used in quantum chemistry to calculate the electronic properties of clusters and molecules.@xcite one advantage of this approach lies in the possibility of treating the whole nanocontact  both tips and the nanowire between them  as a unique entity , described by molecular orbitals .",
    "the tips and the nanowire , upon which we base our transport calculations , are built on the basis of the crystallographic properties of the material as well as the obtained hrtem images ; no attempt was made to simulate the dynamics of the nw formation . in our calculations",
    "the nanocontacts are made up of as many as 150 gold atoms for some structures . in order to calculate the quantum electronic states of au clusters as big as these",
    ", a semi - empirical method is necessary to produce results within reasonable time .",
    "for this reason the eht is employed ; the method includes overlap terms and matrix elements that are not restricted to first neighbors ; moreover , all the valence states ",
    "5d , 6s and 6p , in the case of au  are considered .",
    "one drawback is the fact that , in its standard form , the eht is a one - electron formalism that does not take into account explicitly electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "however , we believe that this problem can be partially circumvented , because of the parameterization of the orbital wavefunctions by self - consistent hartree - fock states and the use of semi - empirical energy parameters . such effects are more relevant for the analysis of the structural stability and relaxation of nanowires , where the calculation of energy manifolds is necessary .",
    "nonetheless , tight - binding together with molecular dynamics methods , similar to the present one , have been successfully used to simulate the dynamics of the nanowire formation.@xcite        let us assume that a nanocontact is formed by two apexes ( or tips ) and the nanowire itself that connects them .",
    "we start the description by defining the molecular hamiltonian of the nanocontact , @xmath14 and its molecular orbitals",
    "( mo s ) @xmath15 : @xmath16 in ( [ mo ] ) the sum over @xmath17 extends over the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals and the index @xmath21 covers all the au atoms in the nanocontact .",
    "the molecular orbitals @xmath15 , written as a linear combination of atomic orbitals in ( [ mo ] ) , obey the orthonormality relation @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ e_nc ] ) defines the mo energies . so that these mo s bear quantum phase coherence along the entire nanocontact .    to account for electron transport",
    "the nanocontact is coupled to infinite au leads on both sides ( left ( @xmath23 ) and right ( @xmath24 ) of the nanocontact ) , which behave as charge reservoirs ( see fig .",
    "[ drawing ] ) .",
    "the leads are divided into unit cells whose mo s are also obtained by the eht method : @xmath25 for the sake of simplicity only @xmath19 au orbitals are used in ( [ bloch ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath26 includes overlap terms and is not restricted to first neighbor matrix elements within the unit cell .",
    "we consider this approximation because the contacts are expected to behave as bulk gold , hence s orbitals are adequate for describing its electronic properties . in the nanoconstriction , where the number of atoms is smaller",
    ", we expect a different behavior . although @xmath27 , it is noteworthy that the scalar product between both types of mo s define the overlap term : @xmath28    having defined the basic physical quantities , let us consider the total hamiltonian @xmath29 the term @xmath30 in ( [ h ] ) is responsible for coupling the nanocontact with the first unit cell of the lead on its left and @xmath31 , similarly , with respect to the first unit cell on the right",
    ". in principle @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be different from each other , as in the case of tips with distinct crystallographic orientations or defects .    to account for the transport calculations consider bloch electrons that propagate through the leads : @xmath34 with @xmath35 as one of the mo s of the unit cell at position @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "at the site of the nanocontact the incoming bloch wave is scattered giving rise to reflected and transmitted waves , according to the framework of the multi - channel landauer formalism.@xcite therefore , for a rightward incoming electron we write the following wavefunction @xmath38 , where @xmath39 the incoming electron has energy @xmath40 in order to be a propagating state . in expression ( [ psi_nc ] ) , @xmath41 represents the @xmath6-mo s of the nanocontact , which occupies the site @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are unknown coefficients .",
    "similarly , in ( [ psi_l ] ) and ( [ psi_r ] ) , @xmath44 is the @xmath45-mo of the unit cell at position @xmath36 ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the channel reflection and transmission coefficients , to be determined in the sequence , which will be used to calculate the total transmission @xmath48 and reflection @xmath49 of electrons propagating through the nanocontact .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 is a dimensionless wave - vector for the bloch waves in the leads .    in order to determine the coefficients",
    "@xmath51 a complete set of mo s @xmath52 is put together , where we project the equation @xmath53 . as a result",
    "we obtain a non - homogeneous system of coupled equations that can be solved numerically to yield these coefficients . a detailed description is provided in the appendix .    concluding the procedure , we define the total transmission and reflection coefficients , which are written in terms of the incoming and outgoing coefficients and the electron velocity @xmath54 of the respective bloch wave mode : @xmath55 where the prime means that the sum is made exclusively over the propagating modes , that is , @xmath56 .",
    "finally , the landauer formula @xcite is used to determine the charge transport through the nanocontact . for a degenerate metallic system in the linear response regime ,",
    "the electrochemical potential difference between source and drain takes the limit @xmath57 and the conductance @xmath58 becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath61 is the fermi energy . since the voltage applied across the leads is small compared to @xmath61 the conductance is to be considered when the electron energy is close to this value .",
    "the arrows show the existence of peaks below 3 @xmath0 .",
    "the insets of every figure show typical conductance curves for each direction.,width=321 ]    figure [ hist](a ) shows the global histogram generated from a series of 500 collected conductance curves of gold nw s measured using the uhv - mcbj .",
    "three peaks can be identified in the histogram ; as expected the major one is close to 1 @xmath0 and , the two minor ones are at 1.8 and 2.8 @xmath0 .",
    "et al._@xcite have demonstrated that analyzing the occurrence of the last two conductance plateaus ( around 1 and 2 @xmath0 ) , the conductance curves can be grouped in three different classes : a ) only a plateau at 1 @xmath0 b ) plateaus at 1 and 2 @xmath0 ; and , finally , c ) no plateau at 1 @xmath0 .",
    "these characteristics are associated with the crystallographic direction along which the nw is being elongated , corresponding to the [ 100 ] , [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] , respectively . as the global histogram superposes and hides this structural information ,",
    "we have built three histograms formed by each group of conductance curves ( fig .",
    "[ hist](b - d ) ) , examples of the conductance curves are presented at the insets ) .",
    "this approach allows us to obtain a statistical validation for the sequence of conductance plateaus appearing during the nw elongation along each axis , extending the range from 2 to 3 @xmath0 . in these terms",
    ", it can be deduced that the thinning of a nw along [ 100 ] axis ( hereafter denoted [ 100 ] nw ) generates a conductance curve with plateaus close to 3 and 1 @xmath0 ( see curves inset fig .",
    "2(b ) ) ; a [ 111 ] nw , plateaus around 3 , 2 and 1 @xmath0 and ; finally , for [ 110 ] nw s , plateaus around 3 and 2 @xmath0 .",

    "figures [ hrtem](a - d ) show snapshots of the elongation process of a nw along the [ 100 ] direction , where the progressive thinning of the constriction can be followed with atomic resolution .",
    "we can see from these images that the nw stretches from a symmetrical bipyramidal nw with a two - atom wide minimal section ( fig .",
    "[ hrtem](b ) ) to a constriction formed by two misaligned truncated pyramids with a two atom wide top ( fig .",
    "[ hrtem](c ) ) . finally , a one - atom - thick contact is formed ( fig .",
    "[ hrtem](d ) ) ; this contact subsequently evolves to form a suspended chain of atoms ( atc ) before rupture ( not shown ) .",
    "figure [ hrtem](e ) allows the clear visualization of the bipyramidal morphology of a one - atom - thick contact formed for [ 111 ] nw s .",
    "in contrast , [ 110 ] nw s generate rod - like structures before rupture ( fig .",
    "[ hrtem](f ) ) .    at this point , it is useful to remind some basic aspects of the reported _ in situ _ hrtem experiments .",
    "firstly , hrtem images of nw s can be described as a two - dimensional projection of the atomic potential , then good quality atomic resolution information is only obtained from crystals very well oriented in relation to the microscope electron beam . in our experiments , we can not easily control the orientation of the apexes forming the nanometric constrictions , so the possibility of getting sequences as shown in fig .",
    "[ hrtem](a - d ) ( [ 100 ] nw ) is statistical and unpredictable .",
    "unfortunately , this kind of detailed information on the atomic arrangement evolution could not be observed for the other two nw types of nanowires ( [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] ) .",
    "another limiting factor of our dynamical hrtem observations is the temporal sampling of our image acquisition system allowing the capture of 30 frames per second ; very rapid events ( @xmath8 1/30 s ) may go by undetected .    despite these difficulties , hrtem images provide a wealth of remarkable information to derive the atomic structure of gold nw s from . by combining the atomic resolution micrographs ( two dimensional projections of the structure ) and the known surface energy properties of the analyzed systems it is possible to deduce the three dimensional atomic arrangement of nw s .",
    "this procedure is based on the so - called wulff construction that allows a quick geometrical determination of the faceting pattern of nanostructures;@xcite such approach has already been successfully applied to study au,@xcite ag@xcite and pt@xcite nw s .    in the following sections , we present a careful and thorough analysis of the derived atomic arrangements and their evolution for the three kinds of au nw s ; the theoretically obtained electronic transport properties of such structures",
    "are compared with the conductance behavior observed with the uhv - mcbj experiment .",
    "the notation indicates the number of atoms in the planes perpendicular to the [ 100 ] axis in the constriction region : ( a ) 941 , ( b ) 949 and ( c ) 9449 tips .",
    "the dashed lines in ( a ) indicate the edge of the fcc unit - cell and a@xmath62 is the lattice parameter.,width=283 ]    the [ 100 ] nanocontacts are generated by two pyramidal tips , each of them faceted by four low energy ( 111 ) planes ; they can be elongated until atomic - chains are formed , having generally two - to - four atoms in length.@xcite figure [ 100 ] illustrates three nanocontact geometries based on the crystallographic structure of face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) bulk gold and the wulff method .",
    "these structures simulate the steps of the nw evolution in the experiments .",
    "figure [ 100](a ) shows the cross - section ( [ 100 ] direction ) and side view ( [ 011 ] direction ) of an atomically sharp [ 100 ] nw tip ; the side view presented represents the structural arrangement as seen from hrtem images in fig .",
    "[ hrtem](a - d ) .",
    "this particular tip is formed by the stacking of a plane of 9 atoms ( black circles ) followed by a plane of 4 atoms ( dark gray circles ) and , finally , one atom at the end of the tip ( light gray circle ) .",
    "the notation used hereafter to designate the structures is given by the number of atoms that make up the alternate planes stacked along the nw orientation axis . the one - atom - thick contact ( 941149 ) which is the structure observed just before rupture ( example",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ hrtem](e ) ) is then formed by mirror imaging the tip arrangement described above .",
    "we can use this pyramidal tip arrangement to model the thicker nw s observed prior to the formation of the 941149 structure , _",
    "i. e. _ , we can build thicker structures by removing planes of atoms from the tip arrangement in fig .",
    "[ 100](a ) .",
    "hence , in simple terms , we would expect that the second thinnest [ 100 ] constriction would be formed by pyramids where the one atom tip is removed leading to a minimum cross - section of four atoms . by joining two pyramids sharing the four - atom plane we generate the 949 neck shown in fig . [ 100](b ) and corresponding to the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ hrtem](b ) .",

    "the thickest nw ( fig . [ 110](a ) ) , labeled 4/3 , is formed by two families of low - energy ( 111 ) facets and two high - energy ( 100 ) ones . by removing 3 lines of atoms from the previous structure",
    "we reduce it to the 2/2 nw .",
    "finally we consider two possible scenarios : the 2/2 nw is subtracted of one of the ( 111 ) planes ( atoms a@xmath67 and a@xmath68 ) , giving rise to the alternate 2-atom chain , 1/1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ 110](c ) ) ; the other possibility is the elimination of the central plane of atoms ( atoms a@xmath68 and a@xmath69 ) , generating the parallel 2-atom chain 2/0 ( fig .",
    "[ 110](d ) ) .     as a function of the electron energy for various rod - like nw s along the [ 110 ] direction : ( a ) 4/3 , ( b ) 2/2 , ( c ) 1/1 , ( d ) 2/0 structures .",
    "the vertical line indicates the @xmath61.,width=8 ]    the calculated conductance for each of the [ 110 ] nw s presented in fig .",
    "[ 110 ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ theo-110 ] .",
    "we can see that the conductance curves presented show oscillations that arise from interference effects inside the contacts .",
    "this oscillations are sensitive to the atomic positions so we must consider an average around the value e@xmath70 .",
    "the calculated conductance for the 4/3 structure , as presented in fig .",
    "[ theo-110](a ) , is @xmath63 @xmath71 4.5 @xmath0 .",
    "meanwhile , for the 2/2 case it is close to 2.8 @xmath0 .",
    "the last two nw s structures , 1/1 and 2/0 , show essentially the same conductance pattern , @xmath63 @xmath11 2 @xmath0 .",
    "the last hrtem image - within the time resolution considered - for nw s formed along the [ 110 ] direction is the 2/2 structure , so it is not possible to resolve the final structure .",
    "however , the conductance histogram of fig . [ hist](d ) shows that the last plateau is approximately 1.8 @xmath0 , indicating that at least one of these structures must be present in uhv - mcbj experiments .",
    "we might consider that the elongation process will increase the interplanar distance in the 2/2 structure and bring atoms a@xmath68 and a@xmath69 together until they reach first neighbor distances",
    ". nonetheless the orientation of the stacking is changed to the [ 100 ] direction . as it happened for the 732237 structure of section [ [ 111 ] ] , the conductance calculated for this case shows slight decrease compared to the perfect structure ( from 2 to 1.5 @xmath0 ) .    in the light of the discussion above , we can model the atomic rearrangements in this direction by removing lines of atoms , starting at the 4/3 structure , which has a conductance @xmath63 @xmath71 4.5 @xmath0 , down to the 2/2 that can be associated , aided by the calculations , to the peak at 2.8 @xmath0 on fig .",
    "[ hist](d ) .",
    "finally , the peak at 2.0 @xmath0 is related to either the 1/1 or 2/0 structures .",
    "which is not present in the first hours of experiment .",
    "inset : typical conductance curves ; note the existence of plateaus at @xmath66 @xmath11 0.2 @xmath0,width=245 ]    the statistical correlation between the occurrence of conductance curve profiles and the multiplicity of zone axis has been hitherto described as a property of the au nanowires.@xcite however , the accordance is only observed during the first hours of measurement after the macroscopic wire was fractured inside the mcbj , while the gold surfaces are free of impurities ; passed this initial period , contamination occurs even in uhv conditions .",
    "that is then evidenced by the appearance of conductance plateaus at values ranging approximately from 0.1 to 0.2 @xmath0 and whose occurrence increases with time.@xcite similar observations have been reported for nw s seen using uhv scanning tunneling microscopy.@xcite the global histogram and typical experimental conductance curves illustrating this effect are shown in fig .",
    "[ imp - exp ] .",
    "likewise , another indication that the mcbj might be contaminated is the fact that the 1 @xmath0 plateaus become exceedingly stable and long , suggesting the formation of entire nanowires made of impurity atoms .",
    "one of the most probable contaminants is carbon .",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations@xcite have shown that the carbon atom naturally occupies a position between two gold atoms in atc s . since the presence of carbon can not be detected by hrtem images because of its low atomic number,@xcite the effect characterized by plateaus at 0.10.2 @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ imp - exp ] ) is therefore the only experimental evidence of its presence .",
    "we have used the formalism of section [ theory ] to address this question . for this purpose , consider the following gold atc s in the [ 100 ] direction : a chain of 2 suspended gold atoms between two [ 100 ] tips ( au - au - au - au , four au atoms forming the narrowest region ) , as well as the contaminated au - c - au - au chain .",
    "the assumed distance separating c and au atoms is 1.8,@xcite whereas the au - au distance is taken to be 2.88",
    ". calculations of the conductance produced for the 2 cases are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ imp - theo ] .",
    "it can be verified that the presence of c atoms in the chain is responsible for decreasing the conductance of the nanocontact considerably from 1 to @xmath11 0.1 @xmath0 , in very good agreement with the experimental results and , moreover , corroborating the assumption that carbon can act as a contaminant of au nw s after a few hours of measurement .",
    "in summary , we have studied experimentally and theoretically the elongation of gold nw s , both from the structural evolution and the quantum conductance behavior . from the experimental point of view , we have used two independent set - ups : an uhv - mcbj operating at room temperature for conductance measurements and hrtem for real - time imaging of the nw atomic rearrangements .",
    "gold nw s adopt only three kinds of atomic structures where the elongation direction is parallel to one of the [ 100 ] , [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] axis .",
    "for each one of these nw types , we have derived the three dimensional structures during different stages of the elongation process , by combining hrtem images and the wulff method .",
    "subsequently conductance calculations , based on the extended hckel theory and the landauer formalism , were applied to the deduced atomic structures , showing an excellent accordance with the conductance measurements .",
    "this approach has provided a consistent correlation between the structural evolution of the three kinds of au nw s and the conductance behavior in the 03 @xmath0 conductance range .",
    "the eht , although rather simple , allows us to take into account the atomic arrangement of the nanocontacs and , also it includes the possibility of considering atoms of different species . as an example of its versatility , we have considered carbon impurities on suspended atom chains ; the results indicate that they act as a contaminant causing the conductance plateaus to decrease from 1 to 0.1 @xmath0 .",
    "this result agrees extremely well with our conductance data of contaminated au nw s and , also those from olesen _",
    "et al_.@xcite    we have , therefore , thoroughly analyzed the relationship between the structural modifications involved in the elongation of au nanowires and their transport behavior .",
    "the main conclusion that must be drawn from this work is the determinant role of an atomistic description when analyzing the conductance properties of nanoscopic metallic wires .",
    "the authors are grateful to fapesp , cnpq and lnls for financial support .",
    "this appendix presents the details of the theory , circumvented in section [ theory ] .",
    "when projected onto the basis states @xmath72 the equation @xmath53 yields the following set of coupled equations for the set of coefficients @xmath73 :      with @xmath75 the term @xmath76 renders the mo energies of a given unit cell whenever @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it also accounts for the hoppingenergies between the nanocontact and the first unit cell of the leads , on both sides , that is , @xmath79 . the same idea applies to the overlap terms @xmath80 . within the leads",
    "we simplify the treatment by taking into account only the coupling between mo s of the same type , which yields @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with @xmath3 and @xmath83 being the same for all mo s .",
    "this is necessary for obtaining analytical expressions for the dispersion energies of the electrons in the leads , which allows us to consider explicitly only the sites @xmath84 in ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "thus the energy dispersion relation is @xmath85 and the velocity of the electron mode @xmath86 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the length of the unit cell .",
    "the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 were chosen to yield a bandwidth of approximately @xmath91 , which is found in bulk au .",
