    "bl lac objects come in at least two flavours , according to their overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) viewed in a @xmath1@xmath2 representation : sources in the first group have the peak of their synchrotron emission in the ir  optical part of the spectrum . to this subclass belong most , but not all , bl lacs discovered through their radio emission . in the second family",
    "the synchrotron peak is located at higher ( uv and soft x ",
    "ray ) frequencies .",
    "these are most , but not all , radio  selected bl lacs . because of this spectral difference , padovani & giommi ( 1995a ) introduced the name lbl ( low energy bl lacs ) and hbl ( high energy bl lacs ) for the two families .",

    "it is one of the closest bl lac object ( @xmath3 ) and it was the second bl lac object , after mkn 421 , to be detected in the tev energy band ( quinn et al .",

    "onboard rossixte , its x  ray emission was relatively low during all 1996 , but it entered a bright and active phase from the beginning of 1997 , with an average flux roughly twice the average of the 1996 flux .",

    "particularly interesting is the last bepposax observation , coincident with a maximum of the tev light curve .",
    "the x  ray spectrum revealed by bepposax was exeptional : it shows the synchrotron peak of its emission at or above 100 kev , with a brightening of the overall power , with respect to other previous observations , by a factor @xmath020 .",

    "5 we plot the ratio between the apr 16 and the apr 7 spectrum ( pian et al . 1998 ) .",

    "note how the spectrum _ pivots _ around @xmath00.5 kev , and the flattening of the spectrum in the high ( apr 16 ) state .",
    "data analysis confirms this behaviour : in table 1 we report the relevant information of the three observations .",
    "the apr 16 spectrum is well fitted by a broken power law in the lecs+mecs range , and another broken power law in the mecs+pds range : confortingly , the two separate analysis agree in the intermediate mecs range .",
    "we can therefore conclude that it is likely that the spectrum continuously steepens from 0.1 to 100 kev , _ but remaining always flatter than @xmath6 .",

    "in bl lac objects the absence of prominent emission lines and of any , albeit weak , thermal signature , such as emission from an accretion disk or reprocessing due to dust , favours emission models based on the synchrotron self  compton ( ssc ) emission , where ultrarelativistic electrons scatter the synchrotron photons they themselves produce ( see e.g. maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ) . on the contrary , in",
    "more powerful emitting line blazars , the dominating process for the formation of the high energy spectrum can be the inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons in the jet off photons produced outside the jet , for instance by the emission line clouds or by the accretion disk ( ec model , dermer & slickeiser 1992 , sikora , begelman & rees 1994 , ghisellini & madau 1996 , ghisellini et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the pure ssc model , however , fails to explain the april observations of mkn 501 .",
    "the main observational constraints are the flattening of the x  ray spectrum between april 7 and 16 , and the simultaneous tev flux variations .",
    "the radiative cooling time of the electrons producing both the x  ray and the tev flux is short , and a continuous resupply of energy must take place .",
    "this can have the form of a continuous injection of high energy particles , which find their equilibrium distribution in a time shorter than the light travel time @xmath12 . in this framework ,",
    "the observed flattening at x  ray energies is caused by the flattening of the injected particle distribution .",
    "however , if the particle distribution is flatter at all energies , the pivoting at @xmath00.5 kev implies that less particles are emitting at ir  optical frequencies . due to the klein nishina decline of the scattering cross section ,",
    "these are the relevant target photons for producing the tev emission .",
    "_ even if the high energy electrons increase in number , the target photons for compton scattering decrease , resulting in a roughly steady tev flux_. to illustrate this behaviour , fig .",
    "7 shows the resulting spectra of the ` pure ' ssc model where the electron injection varies , becoming flatter when more powerful , and extending to larger electron energies @xmath13 .",
    "as can be seen the compton luminosity is almost constant , even if , in restricted energy ranges , the change of @xmath13 results in a possible flux change .",
    "this clearly can not account for the observed correlated variability .",
    "however the emission , here modelled to come from a single homogeneous zone , is likely to be produced at a range of radii along a relativistic jet .",
    "especially so for the radio  far ir flux .",
    "in addition , even in a simple homogeneous model , it is possible that one zone of the region undergoes a violent acceleration event producing a flat electron distribution . at birth",
    ", these electrons are already emdebbed in a ` quiescent ' radiation field , and scatter these _ ambient _ photons together with the ones produced by themselves .",
    "the word ` ambient ' has been chosen to distinguish this model from the ones where the target photons for compton scattering are produced outside the jet .",
    "we have then modelled the spectrum of mkn 501 along these lines , assuming that the region producing the x  ray / tev flare is embedded in a _ steady _ radiation field ( extending in frequency from the mm to the optical ) , corresponding to the observed flux .",
    "results of these models are shown in fig .",
    "6 , along with the fit to the ` quiescent ' spectrum ( i.e. to the collection of non simultaneous data prior to the bepposax observations ) .",
    "note that in this case we can well reproduced all the main spectral characteristics of the source .",
    "for all models we assumed a source size @xmath14 cm , a beaming factor @xmath15 , and a magnetic field @xmath16 gauss .",
    "for the quiescent state , we assumed to continuosly inject relativistic electrons with a power law distribution @xmath17 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at a rate corresponding to an intrinsic injected power of @xmath20 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "for the apr 7 spectrum the injected distribution is @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 erg s@xmath11 . finally , for the apr 16 spectrum , the injection is @xmath25 between @xmath26 and @xmath23 , with @xmath27 erg s@xmath11 . according to these parameters , the magnetic field energy density is greater than the particle energy density , but smaller than the overall radiation energy density . on the other hand ,",
    "if we integrate the radiation energy density up to the energy @xmath28 , accounting then for only those photons available for scattering in the thomson regime , we have that the magnetic field is dominant .",
    "interestingly , the radiative cooling time is equal to the light crossing time for particles emitting at @xmath29 kev , where there is the pivot in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "from the bepposax observations of mkn 501 we have learned that bl lacs can undergo major flaring events , in which their overall , bolometric power increases by a huge factor , while at the same time increasing the typical energy of their radiating electrons .",
    "such events must correspond to a dramatic increase of the power of the particle acceleration mechanism and of its efficiency in accelerating electrons up to tev energies .",
    "the huge shift of the synchrotron peak frequency excludes in fact other possibilities , as a change of the beaming factor or of the magnetic field , since unreasonably large variations would be necessary in this case @xmath30 .",
    "we have also learned that it is likely that a pure , simple , one  zone ssc model can not account for what we observe , but that there is the need to invoke another , steadier , source of ir photons as targets for the inverse compton process .",
    "the coincidence of the amount of needed radiation density with what we derive from the observed flux is an indication that these photons are produced in the vicinity of the hard x  ray and tev emitting region , probably by another , steadier , electron population .",
    "finally we can wonder if mkn 501 is really exeptional , or if other sources exist with the same characteristics , namely a synchrotron peak located in the hard x  rays .",
    "these would garantee the presence of tev energy electron , and therefore these sources are the best candidates to be strong tev emitters . from what we have observed of mkn 501 ,",
    "it might be not easy to find these sources , since : i ) mkn 501 was observed with a steep x  ray spectrum prior to bepposax ; ii ) even during the april 1997 flare , the low energy x  ray flux of mkn 501 was not varying dramatically .    to find these ` extreme synchrotron bl lacs ' one should select sources with flat ( @xmath31 ) x  ray spectra , checking , by constructing the sed , if the x  ray spectrum is produced by the synchrotron process ( in this case the x  rays smoothly connect with the optical - uv data ) . for sources without a measured x  ray spectrum , overall spectral indices joining the radio , optical and the x",
    " ray band can give some hints , since these broad band indices roughly measure the location of the synchrotron peak ."
