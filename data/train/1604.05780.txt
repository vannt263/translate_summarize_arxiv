    "these results have provided important information on the physical origin of color gradients in local galaxies and clues on their buildup and shutdown .    at moderate and high redshifts ,",

    "they found evidence for redder color , lower star formation rate ( ssfr ) , and increased dust extinction in the centers of galaxies , which are consistent with an inside - out disk growth scenario in massive sfgs . in a series of papers by nelson et al .",
    "( i.e. , nelson et al .",

    "these findings suggested that massive sfgs build up their stellar masses from inside out , while the low - mass sfgs grow in a self - similar way , irrespective of the radial distance .",
    "note that dust correction was not done in these two works .",

    "these findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low - mass sfgs , whereas both increased dust reddening and buildup of compact , old bulges in the centers are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high - mass sfgs .",
    "the neutral dust - corrected @xmath0 color gradients in the low - mass sfgs imply that their stellar masses grow self - similarly at all radii .",
    "the negative dust - corrected @xmath0 color gradients in the high - mass sfgs imply that central stars form earlier than outer stars , i.e. , that massive galaxies are growing from inside out .",
    "recently , van der wel et al . (",
    "2014 ) showed that the low - mass galaxies at these redshifts are not disk - like but are prolate and irregular , unlike massive galaxies , which are shaped like normal , oblate disks .",
    "a consistent picture with our data is emerging in which young , low - mass galaxies first grow in an irregular manner , where new generations of stars are randomly mixed with previously existing populations , and that inside - out growth only occurs once galaxies attain a sustained , disk - like structure . assuming that our fourth conclusion persists over a substantial range of redshifts , we infer that star - forming galaxies start out their lives growing self - similarly in their early phases and switch to growing from inside out when their masses pass @xmath65 . since centers appear redder ( older ) after that , the change must happen because the centers slow down rather than the reverse ( having the outer regions accelerate ) .",
    "this change marks the entry into the later stages of star - formation and signals incident entry into the transition region ( green valley ) , followed by quenching",
    ". it will be useful to use galaxy formation models to put actual time markers on these various stages .",
    "we stress that major conclusions in this paper depend on the sed modeling assumptions applied to the candels data , namely ( 1 ) that galaxy stellar populations are single @xmath66-models , ( 2 ) that the dust extinction law is assumed to be the calzetti , and ( 3 ) that the solar metallicity applies to all galaxies .",
    "these standard assumptions are what almost all of high - z studies are currently using",
    ". this paper does not attempt to justify these current state of the art assumptions , but take the standard assumptions as given and aims to see where they lead .",
    "we refer to the reader to fang et al .",
