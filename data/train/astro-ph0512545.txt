    "since 2005 is the einstein - year , a talk on globular clusters can honour it by citing einstein as a pioneer in globular cluster dynamics . in his paper on m13",
    "( einstein 1921 ) he concluded that the non - luminous mass contributes no higher order of magnitude to the total mass than does the luminous mass ( fig .",
    "[ einstein ] ) . to my knowledge",
    "this has been einstein s only contact with globular clusters . as in other issues",
    ", his claim still holds .",
    "+ globular clusters ( gcs ) may have the reputation of looking quite similar to each other , but they are a very inhomogeneous species regarding their intrinsic properties . in terms of mass , metallicity , age , density ,",
    "they span orders of magnitudes .",
    "they are found in all types of galaxies , provided that the host galaxy s mass is sufficient .",
    "different from what was thought decades ago , gcs are not only survivors from the early universe , but have also been formed regularly in galaxies and still form today .",
    "+ the objective of this contribution is to highlight several recent topics in extragalactic gc research with some bias towards our own work .",
    "it is by no means exhaustive and will bravely face the usual fate , namely to be outdated soon .",
    "a more complete review is in preparation ( brodie & strader 2006 ) .",
    "the field is very extensive , ranging from stellar populations to cosmology , so only a few points can be illuminated . in the following i review / comment on these topics :",
    "colour bimodality in globular cluster systems ( gcss ) , young massive clusters , and the brightest old clusters .",
    "there is no doubt that the gcss of early - type galaxies exhibit substructure .",
    "the distinction between halo and bulge clusters with their differences in spatial distribution , chemical composition and kinematics is already familiar from the galactic system .",
    "however , in the case of early - type galaxies , it has been the colour distribution which first indicated subtructure .",
    "ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) were the first to investigate this . because they identified two peaks in the colour distributions of the gcss of ngc 5128 and ngc 4472 ( zepf & ashman 1993 ) , they termed them ",
    "( in fact , they plot metallicities , not colours ) .",
    "a common scenario for the formation of giant ellipticals is through the merging of smaller galaxies . linking bimodality with the merger scenario",
    ", they predicted the abundant formation of gcs in mergers , following schweizer ( 1987 ) .",
    "these newly formed gcs , presumably enriched , constitute the red ( metal - rich ) peak of the bimodal distribution .",
    "later on , it has been found that indeed a lot of new gcs are formed in the star bursts which accompany merger events ( see references in section 3 ) .",
    "bimodality could thus be understood as the sign of two epochs of gc formation .",
    "other models with different prescriptions followed .",
    "forbes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) explained bimodality by having the metal - poor clusters formed  in situ  .",
    "ct et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found the colour distributions most consistent with the accretion / infall of metal - poor clusters and the formation of metal - rich clusters in a dissipational collapse .",
    "beasley et al . ( 2002 ) considered cluster formation within a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation and obtained bimodal metallicity distributions , the metal - poor clusters stemming from protogalactic fragments , and the metal - rich ones from subsequent gaseous mergers .",
    "more observations in the washington system and in v - i ( mainly based on hst data , kundu & whitmore 2001a , kundu & whitmore 2001b , larsen et al .",
    "2001 ) demonstrated that the majority of early - type galaxies , also including fainter galaxies , show bimodal colour distributions .",
    "in fact , _ all _ gcss observed so far in the washington system revealed bimodal distributions , while in v - i , perhaps due to the inferior metallicity resolution , a certain fraction remained unimodal or unclear .",
    "interesting cases are ngc 524 or ngc 4365 ( larsen et al",
    ". 2001 ) which have quite rich gcss , but appear unimodal",
    ". it would be interesting to observe these gcss also in the washington bands in order to see whether this is simply an effect of the photometric system .",
    "+ however , one should note that in many cases , the term  bimodal  does not result from a clear - cut visual appearance in the colour distribution , but from a statistical analysis , often done with a kmm test .",
    "+ figure  [ bimod ] shows the colour distributions in the washington system of the gcss of ngc 1399 , the central giant elliptical in the fornax cluster , and ngc 1387 , a fornax s0 galaxy near ngc 1399 ( dirsch et al .",
    "2003 , bassino et al .",
    "to my knowledge this is the clearest bimodality seen in any galaxy .",
    "being of quite low luminosity and an s0-galaxy , ngc 1387 is not a good candidate for supporting the merger scenario .",
    "however , the processes which produce s0s have , according to common wisdom to do , with interactions of galaxies , and the predominance of red clusters might have its explanation in the star burst which took place while ngc 1387 was transformed into an s0 galaxy . if also low - luminosity ellipticals have bimodal colour distributions , as seen e.g. in ngc 1427 by forte et al .",
    "( 2001 ) one may guess that all ( ! ) gcss have that property , as long as the full colour range is sufficiently sampled .",
    "+ is there a visible systematic relation between the peak locations and the properties of the host galaxy ?",
    "larsen et al . ( 2001 ) , kundu & whitmore ( 2001a ) , and kundu & whitmore ( 2001b ) agree that the red peak is redder for host galaxies of higher luminosity .",
    "this is not so clear for the blue peak .",
    "larsen et al . ( 2001 ) also find the blue peak becoming bluer with decreasing galaxy luminosity and/or central velocity dispersion .",
    "kundu & whitmore , using partly the same data set , failed in uncovering such a relation .",
    "i shall come back to this shortly . in the washington system",
    ", however , where the bimodalities show up much better than in v - i , such a correlation for the blue peak is less obvious ( bassino et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this might have its basis in the fact that the hst data are much more homogeneous than ground based photometries from different telescopes , authors , reduction methods etc .. however , it also can mean that the colour of the blue peak is in fact ( more or less ) universal ( of course , it should not be strictly universal : if the host luminosity is so low that the cluster system consists only of a handful of metal - poor clusters , it is plausible that the mean colour becomes bluer at some point ) . + an effect which argues for an almost universal blue peak and which has not yet been discussed before in the context of bimodalities",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ simulation ] . in the upper left panel a non - peaked distribution of cluster metallicities is shown ( drawn from an exponential distribution ) . to transform it into colours we apply the relation of harris & harris ( 2002 ) . however , at a given metallicity , the colour can vary due to second parameter effects and for real data also due to photometric errors .",
    "we simulate the combined effect by a gaussian scatter with a dispersion of 0.08 mag .",
    "one also notes the non - linearity in the upper right panel .",
    "then we rebin in colour ( lower left panel ) .",
    "the striking blue peak is a consequence of the scatter around a mean colour - metallicity relation in combination with the declining metallicity resolution at bluer colours .",
    "the lower right panel shows the rebinning in metallicity now assuming a unique metallicity - colour relation .",
    "the result differs significantly from the input distribution .",
    "+ an intrinsically bimodal metallicity distribution plausibly gives a bimodal colour distribution , but our example shows that also a unimodal metallicity distribution may result in a bimodal colour distribution .",
    "the colour of the blue peak is uniform , depending on the ( uniform ) colour - metallicity relation and the scatter around the mean relation .",
    "any non - linearity would help to create a blue peak .",
    "strader et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the mean colour of metal - poor clusters ( they quote [ fe / h ] @xmath0 -1 ) follows an extremely shallow relation like @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the host galaxy luminosity ) .",
    "they include intrinsically faint galaxies hosting only a few clusters , where the metallicity distribution is not fully sampled .",
    "therefore their finding does not necessarily contradict a universal blue peak in the above sense .",
    "but strader et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and peng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a similar slope among early - type galaxies in virgo , so the blue peak does not seem to be strictly universal . whether the described effect dominates the colour distribution is left to a deeper analysis , but at least it could be responsible for the shallowness of the above relation .",
    "metallicity distribution and colour distribution might be less closely linked than previously thought .",
    "however , a colour distribution like that seen for ngc 1387 can not be the result of non - linearity or second parameters , but probably indicates the disk and halo structure of an s0-galaxy , as has been found also for ngc 1380 ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "1997 ) . within a merger scenario ,",
    "the resulting gcs is expected to be a composit of many different cluster formation processes : gc formation in the star bursts of the merger components , in tidal tails , the original clusters of the merger components , and late infall of clusters .",
    "the majority of clusters in early - type galaxies must have formed at high redshift : strader et al .",
    "( 2005b ) found in their sample of spectroscopically derived ages and metallicities no clusters , whether blue or red , which are younger than about 10 gyr .",
    "moreover , no age difference between metal - poor and metal - rich clusters is visible within the uncertainties .",
    "the mere morphological phenomenon of colour bimodality as an indication of two and only two formation epochs should thus not be overinterpreted .",
    "cluster colours provide first hints , but for the physically interesting substructure of a gcs to be revealed , one needs spectroscopic metallicities , ages , and kinematics . +",
    "when speaking about colour bimodality , one should also mention where it does _ not _ occur , namely among the brightest clusters in rich cluster systems ( dirsch et al .",
    "2003 , harris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the absence of metal - poor objects among very massive clusters might be explained by massive progenitor clouds which are systematically more enriched than their less massive counterparts ( harris et al .",
    "another ( not necessarily competing ) possibility is that this mass range is contaminated by tidally stripped dwarf galaxies whose nuclei now appear as globular clusters ( compare also section 4 ) .",
    "the classic view on gcs as representatives of the oldest stellar populations has experienced considerable modifications .",
    "thirty years ago it was an irritating fact that the magellanic clouds host gc - like objects which are , however , much younger than the old galactic gcs ( e.g van den bergh 1975 ) .",
    "nowadays we know that the conditions for the formation of gcs were not exclusively realized in the early universe but that gc formation is a regular feature of star formation processes in a variety of environments , the most spectacular ones being galaxy mergers ( e.g. whitmore et al .",
    "1993 , whitmore & schweizer 1995 , de grijs et al .",
    "2003 , tran et al .",
    "the most massive young cluster known today is w3 in the merger galaxy ngc 7252 with an age of about 500 myr and a mass of about @xmath3 ( maraston et al .",
    "it has an absolute magnitude of @xmath4 and thus rivals m32 , the compact companion of the andromeda galaxy .",
    "it still will have about @xmath5 when it is 12 gyrs old , and thus may be a progenitor for  ultracompact dwarfs ",
    "( see the next section ) .",
    "clusters often tend to form in complexes which for example are found in the antenna galaxy ( whitmore et al .",
    "the simulations of fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002 ) predict a rapid merging of star cluster complexes , so consequently fellhauer & kroupa ( 2005 ) propose the merging of clusters as a possible formation scenario for w3 .",
    "+ apparently , merger events provide the best conditions for forming massive clusters .",
    "if this is so one would expect to find intermediate - age globular clusters in galaxies which are known to be merger remnants .",
    "nearby examples , where indeed intermediate - age clusters have been found , are centaurus a , ngc 1316 , and ngc 3921 ( peng et al .",
    "2004 , goudfrooij et al .",
    "2004 , schweizer et al .",
    "intermediate - age clusters have also been detected photometrically in early - type galaxies which are not obvious merger remnants ( puzia et al .",
    "2002 , hempel & kissler - patig 2004 ) .",
    "the number of clusters formed in a merger event may plausibly depend much on its specific properties including the possibility that no clusters or only an insignificant number are formed .",
    "ngc 1052 shows some signatures of a recent merger with an associated star burst , but pierce et al .",
    "( 2005 ) did not find evidence for younger ages in their sample of 16 gcs .",
    "+ also starburst galaxies possess populations of young massive clusters .",
    "one example is ngc 1569 ( hunter et al . 2000 ) but there are many more .",
    "+ however , the formation of globular clusters is not restricted to these relatively extreme environments .",
    "larsen & richtler ( 1999 , 2000 ) performed the first systematic search among spiral galaxies for young luminous clusters . in their sample of 21 nearby face - on spirals",
    ", they found many . introducing the parameter @xmath6 , which measures the total light coming from the identified young clusters normalized to the light of the host galaxy",
    ", they showed that this parameter correlates best with the far - infrared luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "this in turn is a measure for the star formation rate .",
    "+ in comparison with the sample galaxies , the milky way s star formation rate is quite low , and the fact that galactic massive young clusters are rare or even not existing , is therefore not suprising .",
    "however , one needs dynamical information in order to assess whether the luminous clusters found in galactic disks really are the young counterparts of old gcs .",
    "larsen & richtler ( 2004 ) estimated virial masses for two bright clusters in m83 , resulting in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the cluster ages are about @xmath9 and @xmath10 years .",
    "the derived masses are consistent with  normal  stellar mass functions and show that these objects deserve the label  young globular clusters  .",
    "+    in the sample of larsen & richtler , ngc 6946 is worthy of particular note .",
    "figure  [ n6946 ] shows an interesting cluster and its environment in this galaxy , investigated in detail by elmegreen et al .",

    "( 2001 ) , larsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and efremov et al .",
    "the cluster is located near the center of a stellar complex with very high surface brightness and an approximately circular shape ( diameter 600 pc ) at a distance of 4.8 kpc from the center of ngc 6946 .",
    "its brightness is @xmath11 and its mass is estimated to be about @xmath12 .",
    "other fainter clusters could be identified in this complex . moreover , dust features are visible . it may be spherical , but a face - on disky structure with the massive cluster as the central object is plausible , regarding the thin disks even in large spiral galaxies . although by far not as massive as w3 , this concentrated occurrence of star clusters in a region with a high star formation rate is perhaps an example for the scenario suggested by fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002 ) , leaving a cluster embedded in an extended envelope . + what does the correlation of star formation rate and efficient",
    "clustering mean ?",
    "could a high star formation rate be a trigger for cluster formation or do both result from the same physical conditions ?",
    "it seems that the latter is the case .",
    "cluster formation needs regions of high pressure ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , the natural sites being the cores of giant molecular clouds . a high density of cold gas results in a high star formation efficiency and favours clustering ( geyer & burkert 2001 ) . in these regions",
    "the star formation rate is also high .",
    "kravtsov & gnedin ( 2005 ) simulate cluster formation in the context of hierarchical cosmologies and find a similar relation between the efficiency of forming massive clusters and the star formation rate as found by larsen & richtler . in their model , the interpretation simply is the above .",
    "however , the conditions which lead to a large reservoir of cold , dense gas might be different in different galaxy types .",
    "billett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) searched for massive clusters in dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the main result is that dwarf galaxies do not follow the trends observed for spirals .",
    "billett et al .",
    "explain the correlation between star formation rate and clustering found for large spirals by correlations between star formation rate , maximum cluster mass , column density , and pressure in combination with statistical effects .",
    "they suggest that gc formation in dwarf galaxies occurs under different circumstances than in spiral galaxies , triggered by large scale flows in the absence of shear .",
    "the most massive clusters in dwarf galaxies are statistically not expected , but probably need unique conditions .",
    "it therefore seems that a general high star formation rate is a necessary condition for gc formation , but not a sufficient one .",
    "the long history of research on the brightest cluster in the galactic system , @xmath13 centauri , has yet not converged towards a commonly accepted picture .",
    "the last two years saw some surprising discoveries ( see piotto et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "one could cautiously say that a scenario in which @xmath13 centauri has formerly been the nucleus of a dwarf galaxies which has fallen into the milky way and has been tidally stripped , is perhaps the most promising working hypothesis ( e.g. hilker & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "other models are , however , not ruled out .",
    "for example , fellhauer & kroupa ( 2003 ) discuss the formation of super - star clusters in an ancient star burst , which subsequently merged to form @xmath13 centauri .",
    "+ if it is already that difficult to understand a galactic gc with all possibilities of detailed investigation , it is not surprising that unfamiliar objects in external galaxies are even more difficult to understand .",
    "hilker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , searching for new members of the fornax galaxy cluster ,  discovered  two gc - like objects with radial velocities placing them into the fornax cluster , but with magnitudes brighter than any gc known until then .",

    "this combination of brightness and concentration is extremely rare , but a plausible intermediate - age counterpart is w3 in ngc 7252 ( maraston et al .",
    "+ there are more arguments in favour and against dwarf galaxies as progenitors for ucds .",
    "an interesting idea is from mieske et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who expect a dynamical difference between  normal  gcs and objects which are the result of  galaxy threshing  . since the stripping process relies on elongated orbits and small perigalactic radii ( bassino 1994 , bekki et al .",

    "the number of ucds is admittedly small for dynamical analyses .",
    "however , from the sample of mieske et al .",
    "it appears that the brightest gcs have indeed a ( marginally ) smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "+ perhaps a deeper insight into the nature of ucds results from the work of haegan et al .",

    "their @xmath15-ratios are high ( about 3 ) but still consistent with old , metal - rich gcs .",
    "three of the other four , however , have @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , the object with the largest effective radius again has @xmath22 .",
    "haegan et al .",
    "propose that the high @xmath15-ratios are due to a high dark matter content which is the distinguishing property between ucds and  normal  gcs .",
    "the dark matter halo would then be the dark matter debris of a stripped dwarf galaxy .",
    "if this was true , none of the fornax objects would be real ucds in the sense of haegan et al .",
    ", since the m / l - values measured by drinkwater ( 2003 ) are all plausibly consistent with stellar populations .",
    "+ however , since the measured velocity dispersion essentially is the central velocity dispersion , the mass profile of ucds with a dark matter halo must be closely following the light profile to have a dark matter dominated central region .",
    "this again would be strange , because stripping of dwarf galaxies works most effectively with a flat dark matter core ( bekki et al .",
    "another possibility is a central black hole , which would have to be rather massive to increase the m / l - ratio by a factor of 2 .",
    "baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that a black hole can puff up the core of its hosting cluster quite considerably .",
    "einstein s finding for m13 ( see the introduction ) perhaps is still relevant for distinguishing globular clusters from ucds .",
    "+ it is also interesting to note that many of the brightest globular clusters , including w3 , have quite high ellipticities ( e.g. larsen 2001 ) , while the ucds and dwarf galaxy nuclei appear more spherical .",
    "if the ellipticity is due to rotation ( which is not known ) , one could think of it as a consequence of angular momentum conservation in the merging of smaller subunits , but the simulations of fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002 ) reveal quite spherical objects as a result of cluster merging .",
    "+ however , the example of w3 shows that very massive clusters can form without invoking a scenario with infalling donator galaxies and it remains open to what degree infalling dwarf galaxies can shape the appearance of a gc system .",
    "the field of gc research , of which a few topics have been presented here , is as exciting as ever .",
    "one can not yet claim that the formation of globular clusters and their relation to their host galaxies are well understood , neither does it constitute a total mystery .",
    "globular clusters may even have formed in different ways as entire objects or by coagulation of smaller units .",
    "their potential for understanding galaxy formation and evolution is just on the verge of being exploited .",
    "the determination of ages , metallicites , internal dynamics , and kinematic and dynamical properties of cluster systems requires lots of work .",
    "however , it is fun by itself and promises deep insights into the evolution of structure .",
    "einstein s notion that m13 does not host large amounts of dark matter touched already upon one of the fundamentals of structure formation and today even appears more revelant than 85 years ago .",
    "i thank the aryabhatta research institute of observational science , naini tal , for the invitation , warm hospitality ( which more than balanced the low temperatures ) , and financial support .",

    "15010003 is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "i am indebted to boris dirsch for many discussions during the last years . that bimodalities can also emerge from non - peaked metallicity distributions , was originally his idea .",
