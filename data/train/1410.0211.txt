    "the theory related to the linearized einstein equations is important in cosmology because it describes the growth of all kinds of structures in the expanding universe , such as stars , galaxies and microwave background fluctuations .",
    "lifshitz  @xcite and lifshitz and khalatnikov  @xcite were the first researchers to derive a cosmological perturbation theory . due to the general covariance of the einstein equations and conservation laws",
    ", they encountered the problem that the linear equations have physical solutions as well as spurious solutions , the so - called gauge modes , which obscure the physics .    in his seminal article bardeen",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the use of _ gauge - invariant _ quantities , i.e. , quantities that are invariant under the general linear infinitesimal coordinate transformation ( [ func ] ) , in the construction of a perturbation theory ensures that it is free of spurious solutions .",
    "as bardeen has put it : _ only gauge - invariant quantities have an inherent physical meaning_. stewart  @xcite defines gauge - invariant quantities as ` quantities that are @xmath0 independent ' , which is equivalent to the definition of bardeen .",
    "stewart  @xcite , kodama and sasaki  @xcite elaborated and clarified the work of bardeen .",
    "the article of bardeen has inspired the pioneering works of ellis et  al .",
    "@xcite and mukhanov et  al .",
    "these researchers proposed alternative perturbation theories using gauge - invariant quantities which differ from the ones used by bardeen .",
    "the equivalence of the approach of bardeen and the formalism of ellis et  al .  has been shown by bruni et  al .",
    "the study of density perturbations has therefore been much refined since lifshitz initiated his research in 1946 .    motivated by the importance of cosmological perturbation theories in the study of structure formation in the early universe , a thorough analysis of the influential research presented by the above mentioned authors and important",
    "recent work  @xcite has been conducted .",
    "this study has revealed that , in addition to the use of gauge - invariant quantities , the theory of cosmological perturbations can be improved even further .",
    "the main result of this article is that it is demonstrated that  for equations of state for the pressure , @xmath1  there are in a cosmological perturbation theory exactly two , unique , gauge - invariant quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , ( [ e - n - gi ] ) , which describe the perturbations to the energy density and particle number density .",
    "the third gauge - invariant quantity @xmath4 , ( [ theta - gi ] ) , namely the local perturbation to the expansion scalar , vanishes identically .",
    "this implies that , in first - order , a _",
    "density perturbation does not affect the _ global _ expansion of the universe .",
    "the proof of this theorem consists of two steps .",
    "first , the uniqueness of the gauge - invariant quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 is shown .",
    "next , it is demonstrated that these quantities are indeed the perturbations to the energy density and particle number density .",
    "the proof of the uniqueness is based on the fact that the full set of the perturbed einstein equations and conservation laws ( [ subeq : basis ] ) can for scalar perturbations be rewritten as ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) which is precisely the perturbed counterpart of the background system ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) .",
    "in fact , the system ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) is a direct consequence of the theorems of york  @xcite , stewart and walker  @xcite and stewart  @xcite on the decomposition of perturbed _ spatial _ symmetric second - rank tensors , such as the metric tensor and ricci tensor , and the spatial part of the perturbed fluid four - velocity .",
    "this is discussed in detail in sections  [ sec : decomp - h - u ] and  [ sec : scalar - pert ] . from the systems of equations ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) and ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) , it follows that exactly three scalars ( [ eq : scalars - flrw ] ) and their first - order perturbations play a role in the evolution of cosmological density perturbations .",
    "consequently , one can construct exactly two ( non - zero ) gauge - invariant , i.e. , measurable , quantities ( [ e - n - gi ] ) by elimination of the gauge function @xmath5 occurring in the transformation ( [ eq : trans - scalar ] ) .",
    "this proves the uniqueness of these quantities .",
    "an important corollary of the decomposition theorems of york , stewart and walker is that in equations ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) _ all metric tensor perturbations _ are contained in only two quantities , namely @xmath6 , ( [ driekrom ] ) , and @xmath7 , ( [ fes5 ] ) . as a consequence , the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) ensuing from the system ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] )",
    "do not contain unnecessary gradient terms  @xcite .    now that the uniqueness of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , ( [ e - n - gi ] ) , has been demonstrated , it remains to be shown that these quantities are indeed the energy density perturbation and particle number density perturbation , respectively , in the general theory of relativity .",
    "this is done by taking the non - relativistic limit . using the quantity @xmath2 , equations ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) become in the non - relativistic limit equal to the poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) of the newtonian theory of gravity .",
    "the poisson equation is , again , a direct consequence of the york , stewart and walker decomposition theorems , namely ( [ decomp - hij - par ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is in the non - relativistic limit proportional to @xmath3 , ( [ eq : newt - ngi ] ) , where the factor of proportionality is the rest mass of a particle .",
    "thus , in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath2 and @xmath3 become equal to their newtonian counterparts . therefore , the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , given by ( [ e - n - gi ] ) , are the unique energy density perturbation and particle number perturbation , respectively , in the general theory of relativity and in the newtonian theory of gravity .    in the non - relativistic limit there",
    "is left some gauge freedom , since the newtonian theory of gravity is invariant under the infinitesimal coordinate transformation ( [ eq : gauge - trans - newt ] ) .",
    "finally , evolution equations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are derived . applying the algorithm given in the appendix ,",
    "the set of equations ( [ subeq : pertub - gi ] ) for the four gauge - dependent quantities @xmath9 is , using the expressions ( [ subeq : pertub - gi - e - n ] ) and ( [ eq : contrast ] ) , recast in the system ( [ subeq : final ] ) for the gauge - invariant energy density and particle number density contrast functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "what is done , essentially , is to rewrite the linearized einstein equations for the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 in terms of the measurable energy and particle number densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , just as in electromagnetism the coulomb and ampre laws for the scalar potential potential @xmath14 and vector potential @xmath15 can be rewritten in the form of the maxwell equations for the measurable electric field @xmath16 and magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "the equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) , which are a second important result of the present article , are evolution equations for perturbations in the energy density and entropy in open , @xmath18 , flat , @xmath19 or closed , @xmath20 , friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universes .    the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) and their solutions are , by construction , invariant under general infinitesimal coordinate transformations ( [ func ] ) .",
    "consequently , there is no need to choose a particular coordinate system to solve these equations and interpret their outcome .",
    "moreover , the evolution equations are valid for _ all _ scales , so that there is no need to distinguish between sub - horizon and super - horizon perturbations .",
    "this solves the gauge problem of cosmology .    in a companion article  @xcite the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] )",
    "will be solved .",
    "since the solutions are not contaminated with spurious gauge modes , the physical consequences of the new approach to cosmological perturbations stand out clearly .",
    "in this section the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) for density perturbations in flrw universes are derived . the background equations ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) and first - order perturbation equations ( [ subeq : basis ] ) , from which the evolution equations are derived , can be deduced from the set of einstein equations ( 97.11)(97.13 ) from the textbook  @xcite of landau and lifshitz and the conservation laws @xmath21 . for a detailed derivation of the basic equations ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) and ( [ subeq : basis ] ) , see  @xcite , sections  ii and  iii .",
    "barotropic equations of state @xmath22 do not take into account the particle number density , so that the influence of entropy perturbations on the evolution of density perturbations can not be studied , see section  [ subsec : adiabatic - pert ] .",
    "since heat exchange of a perturbation with its environment could be important for structure formation in the early universe , realistic equations of state are needed . from thermodynamics",
    "it is known that both the energy density @xmath23 and the pressure @xmath24 depend on the independent quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 where @xmath25 is the particle number density and @xmath26 is the absolute temperature . since @xmath26 can ,",
    "in principle , be eliminated from these equations of state , a computationally more convenient equation of state for the pressure is used , namely @xmath28 this , non - barotropic , equation of state and its partial derivatives has been included in the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) .      in order to derive the evolution equations a suitable system of reference must be chosen . due to the general covariance of the einstein equations and conservation laws ,",
    "the general theory of relativity is invariant under a general coordinate transformation @xmath29 , implying that there are no preferred coordinate systems ( weinberg  @xcite , appendix  b ) . in particular ,",
    "the linearized einstein equations and conservation laws are invariant under a general linear coordinate transformation ( i.e. , a gauge transformation ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 are four arbitrary , first - order ( infinitesimal ) functions of time , @xmath32 , and space , @xmath33 , coordinates , the so - called gauge functions .",
    "since there are no preferred systems of reference and since the solutions of the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) are invariant under the infinitesimal coordinate transformation ( [ func ] ) , i.e. , are gauge - invariant , one may use _ any _ coordinate system to derive the evolution equations .",
    "a suitable system of reference can be chosen by the following two considerations .",
    "firstly , in order to put an accurate interpretation on the gauge - invariant quantities ( [ subeq : gi - quant ] ) one needs the non - relativistic limit . in the newtonian theory of gravity space and time",
    "are strictly separated , implying that in this theory _ all _ coordinate systems are essentially _ synchronous_. in view of the non - relativistic limit , it would , therefore , be convenient to use synchronous coordinates  @xcite in the background as well as in the perturbed universe . in these",
    "coordinates the metric tensor of flrw universes has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath36 indicates that coordinate time is equal to proper time , @xmath37 is the ( global ) synchronicity condition ( see landau and lifshitz  @xcite ,   84 ) and",
    "@xmath38 is the metric tensor of the three - dimensional maximally symmetric sub - spaces of constant time . from the killing equations @xmath39 and ( [ eq : metric - flrw ] ) it follows that the functions @xmath40 in ( [ func ] ) become @xmath41 if only transformations between synchronous coordinates are allowed .",
    "the four functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 can not be fixed since the four coordinate conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 have already exhausted all four degrees of freedom , see weinberg  @xcite , section  7.4 on coordinate conditions .",
    "secondly , a property of a synchronous system of reference  ( [ eq : metric - flrw ] ) , which is important for the derivation of the evolution equations , is that the space - space components of the four - dimensional ricci curvature tensor @xmath44 is split up into two parts such that one part contains exclusively all time - derivatives of the space - space components of the metric tensor and the second part @xmath45 is precisely the ricci curvature tensor of the three - dimensional sub - spaces of constant time , see ( 97.10 ) in the textbook of landau and lifshitz  @xcite .",
    "this property makes it possible to apply the decomposition theorems of york , stewart , and walker to the perturbed metric tensor and perturbed ricci tensor .    in conclusion , in order to arrive at the non - relativistic limit and",
    "to apply the decomposition theorem of symmetric second - rank three - tensors , a synchronous system of reference is the most appropriate coordinate system to derive the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) .      in this section",
    "the background and first - order einstein equations and conservation laws are given .",
    "expressions pertaining to density perturbations , i.e. , the expansion scalar , the spatial part of the ricci curvature tensor and its trace and the three - divergence of the spatial part of the fluid four - velocity , are derived .",
    "the complete set of zeroth - order einstein equations and conservation laws for an open , flat or closed flrw universe filled with a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor @xmath46 is , in synchronous coordinates , given by    [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] @xmath47    the @xmath48 constraint equations and the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , dynamical equations are identically satisfied .",
    "the @xmath51 dynamical equations are equivalent to the time - derivative of the @xmath52 constraint equation ( [ frw3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath49 dynamical equations need not be taken into account . in equations  ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) @xmath53 is the cosmological constant , @xmath54 the gravitational constant of the newtonian theory of gravity and @xmath55 the speed of light .",
    "an over - dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath56 and the sub - index @xmath57 refers to the background , i.e. , unperturbed , quantities .",
    "furthermore , @xmath58 is the hubble function which is equal to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the background value of the expansion scalar @xmath61 with @xmath62 the fluid four - velocity , normalized to unity ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "a semicolon denotes covariant differentiation with respect to the background metric tensor @xmath64 .",

    "the coordinate system is essentially co - moving .    from the system  ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) one can deduce that the evolution of an unperturbed flrw universe is determined by exactly three independent scalars , namely @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the cosmological particle current four - vector , which satisfies the particle number conservation law @xmath74 , ( [ frw2a ] ) , see weinberg  @xcite , appendix  b. as will become clear in section  [ sec : unique ] , the quantities ( [ eq : scalars - flrw ] ) and their first - order counterparts play a key role in the evolution of cosmological density perturbations .",

    "the case @xmath98 is considered in section  [ sec : newt - limit ] on the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the decomposition theorems of york , stewart , and walker are used in section  [ sec : scalar - pert ] to rewrite the full set of einstein equations ( [ subeq : basis ] ) into a substantially simpler set of equations ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) which describe exclusively scalar perturbations .",
    "this set , together with the background equations ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) , form the basis of the evolution equations ( [ subeq : final ] ) .",
    "york  @xcite , stewart and walker  @xcite and stewart  @xcite showed that _ any _ symmetric second - rank three - tensor , and hence the perturbation tensor @xmath99 and the perturbed ricci tensor @xmath100 , can uniquely be decomposed into three parts .",

    "it follows from @xmath120 and ( [ driekrom ] ) and ( [ eq : prop - hij ] ) that @xmath121 must obey @xmath122 in addition to @xmath123 , whereas @xmath124 and @xmath125 are automatically fulfilled due to the properties ( [ eq : prop - hij ] ) of @xmath126 , see  @xcite , section  iv .",
