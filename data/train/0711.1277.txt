    "the cohomology @xmath15 plays an important role in number theory , through its connection with automorphic forms and ( mostly conjectural ) relationship to representations of the absolute galois group @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "this relationship is revealed in part through the action of the _ hecke operators _ on the cohomology spaces .",
    "hecke operators are endomorphisms induced from a family of correspondences associated to the pair @xmath17 ; the arithmetic nature of the cohomology is contained in the eigenvalues of these linear maps .    for @xmath18 ,",
    "_ modular symbols _ provide a concrete method to compute the hecke eigenvalues in @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the top nonvanishing degree @xcite . using modular symbols",
    "many people have studied the arithmetic significance of this cohomology group , especially for @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite ; these are the only two values of @xmath23 for which @xmath19 can contain cuspidal cohomology classes , in other words cohomology classes coming from cuspidal automorphic forms on @xmath24 .",
    "another setting where automorphic cohomology has been profitably studied using modular symbols is that of @xmath25 , where @xmath1 is the ring of integers in a complex quadratic field @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is a three - dimensional hyperbolic orbifold ; modular symbols allow investigation of @xmath26 , which again contains cuspidal cohomology classes .    [ [ section ] ]    now let @xmath0 be a real quadratic field with ring of integers @xmath1 , and let @xmath7 be the @xmath8-group @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a congruence subgroup .",
    "in this case we have @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the upper halfplane (  [ sec : voronoi ] ) .",
    "the locally symmetric space @xmath14 is topologically a circle bundle over a hilbert modular surface , possibly with orbifold singularities if @xmath3 has torsion .",
    "the cuspidal cohomology of @xmath14 is built from cuspidal hilbert modular forms .",
    "hence an algorithm to compute the hecke eigenvalues on the cuspidal cohomology gives a topological technique to compute the hecke eigenvalues of such forms .",
    "but in this case there is a big difference from the setting in  [ ss : intro ] : the top degree cohomology occurs in degree @xmath31 , but the cuspidal cohomology appears in degrees @xmath32 .. in this case the locally symmetric space is a hilbert modular surface , and the cuspidal hilbert modular forms contribute to @xmath33 .",
    "our symmetric space is slightly larger since the real rank of @xmath7 is larger than that of @xmath34 .",
    "however , regardless of whether one studies the hilbert modular surface or our @xmath35 symmetric space , the cusp forms contribute to the cohomology in degree one below the top nonvanishing degree . ]",
    "thus modular symbols can not `` see '' the cuspidal hilbert modular forms , and can not directly be used to compute the hecke eigenvalues .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in this article we discuss a technique , based on constructions in @xcite , that in practice allows one to compute the hecke action on the cohomology space @xmath36 . moreover it is easy to modify our technique to compute with other local systems ; all the geometric complexity occurs for trivial coefficients . here",
    "we must stress the phrase _ in practice _",
    ", since we can not prove that our technique will actually work . nevertheless , the ideas in @xcite have been successfully used in practice @xcite , and the modifications presented here have been extensively tested for @xmath37 .    the basic idea is the following .",
    "we first identify a finite topological model for @xmath38 , the _ voronoreduced _ cocycles .",
    "this uses a generalization of vorono s reduction theory for positive definite quadratic forms @xcite , which constructs a @xmath3-equivariant tessellation of @xmath12 (  [ sec : voronoi ] ) .",
    "the hecke operators do not act directly on this model , and to accommodate the hecke translates of reduced cocycles we work with a larger model for the cohomology , the ( infinite - dimensional ) space @xmath39 of _ @xmath2-sharblies _ modulo @xmath40 (  [ sec : sharbly ] ) .",
    "the space @xmath39 is part of a homological complex @xmath41 with hecke action that naturally computes the cohomology of @xmath14 .",
    "any voronoreduced cocycle in @xmath42 gives rise to a @xmath2-sharbly cycle , which allows us to identify a finite dimensional subspace @xmath43 .",
    "the main construction is then to take a general @xmath2-sharbly cycle @xmath44 and to modify it by subtracting an appropriate coboundary to obtain a homologous cycle @xmath45 that is closer to being voronoreduced (  [ sec : reduction ] ) . by iterating this process",
    ", we eventually obtain a cycle that lies in our finite - dimensional subspace @xmath46 .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to prove that at each step the output cycle @xmath45 is better than the input cycle @xmath47 , in other words that it is somehow `` more reduced . ''",
    "however , in practice this always works .    the passage from @xmath44 to @xmath45",
    "is based on ideas found in @xcite , which describes an algorithm to compute the hecke action on @xmath48 of congruence subgroups of @xmath49 .",
    "the common feature that this case has with that of subgroups of @xmath4 is that the cuspidal cohomology appears in the degree one less than the highest .",
    "this means that from our point of view the two cases are geometrically very similar .",
    "there are some complications , however , coming from the presence of non - torsion units in @xmath1 , complications leading to new phenomena requiring ideas not found in @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in  [ sec : comments ] .",
    "we conclude the article by exhibiting the reduction of a @xmath2-sharbly to a sum of voronoreduced @xmath2-sharblies where the base field is @xmath50 (  [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "we remark that there is another case sharing these same geometric features , namely that of subgroups of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a complex quartic field .",
    "we are currently applying the algorithm in joint work with f.  hajir and d.  ramakrishnan for @xmath53 to compute the cohomology of congruence subgroups of @xmath54 and to investigate the connections between automorphic cohomology and elliptic curves over @xmath52 .",
    "details of these cohomology computations , including some special features of the field @xmath52 , will appear in @xcite ; the present paper focuses on the hilbert modular case .",
    "finally , we remark that there is a rather different method to compute the hecke action on hilbert modular forms using the jacquet ",
    "langlands correspondence .",
    "for details we refer to work of l.  dembl @xcite .",
    "however , the jacquet  langlands technique works only with the complex cohomology of subgroups of @xmath55 , whereas our method in principle allows one to compute with torsion classes in the cohomology .",
