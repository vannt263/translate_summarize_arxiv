    ", we can refer to figures  [ fig - i-1to6-nonmag - fourier ] , [ fig - i-1to6-mag - fourier ] and table  [ table_1 ] .",
    "the component @xmath207 contributes dominantly to @xmath14 , and is almost identical to @xmath14 because the contribution from @xmath205 with @xmath236 are negligible ( for both the values of @xmath29 ) .",

    "also , the components @xmath239 and @xmath237 have the same sign for both the values of @xmath29 .",

    "the ad and the aa values of @xmath224 sometimes coincide well and sometimes differ significantly .",
    "this is because , the fourier components of the ad prd functions @xmath240 with @xmath102 essentially represent the azimuthal averages of the ad @xmath60 functions and are not same as the explicit angle - averages of the ad @xmath60 functions .",
    "the latter are obtained by averaging over both co - latitudes and azimuths ( i.e. , over all the scattering angles ) .",
    "the @xmath241-dependence of the ad @xmath60 functions are contained dominantly in the @xmath242 terms and the @xmath29-dependence is contained dominantly in the higher order terms in the fourier expansions of the ad @xmath60 functions .",
    "for this reason the aa prd can not always be a good representation of the ad prd , especially in the 2d polarized line transfer .",
    "this can be attributed to the strong dependence of the radiation field on the azimuth angle ( @xmath29 ) in the 2d geometry . as will be shown below",

    "the presence of a weak , oriented magnetic field modifies the values of @xmath224 and @xmath225 in the line core ( @xmath249 ) to a considerable extent , due to hanle effect .",
    "further , it is for @xmath161 that the differences between the aa and the ad prd become more significant . in both the figures  [ fig - varphi - q ] and [ fig - varphi - u ] , the dashed and dot - dashed curves represent @xmath161 case . as usual",

    "we recall here that the essential effects are due to the finite boundaries in multi - d media , which cause leaking of radiation and hence a decrease in the values of stokes @xmath193 , and a sharp rise in the values of @xmath224 and @xmath225 near the boundaries .",
    "multi - d geometry naturally breaks the axisymmetry of the medium that prevails in a 1d planar medium .",
    "this leads to significant differences in the values of @xmath224 and @xmath225 formed in 1d and multi - d media ( compare solid lines in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure   [ fig-2d - t20 ] ) .",
    "as pointed out in papers i , ii and iii , for non - magnetic case , @xmath225 is zero in 1d media while in 2d media a non - zero @xmath225 is generated due to symmetry breaking by the finite boundaries .",
    "for the @xmath194 values chosen in figure  [ fig-2d - t20](b ) @xmath243_{\\rm aa}$]is nearly zero even for non - magnetic 2d case , which is not generally true for other choices of @xmath194 ( see solid lines in various panels of figure  [ fig - varphi - u ] ) .",

    "the spatial distribution of source vector components @xmath251 and @xmath252 represent the anisotropy of the radiation field in the 2d medium .",

    "[ fig-2d - surface - aa - ad - x0 ] we consider @xmath253 ( line center ) . for the chosen values of @xmath194",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath250 is not very different for the aa and the ad prd . @xmath251 and @xmath252 for both the aa and the ad prd have similar magnitudes ( figures  [ fig-2d - surface - aa - ad - x0](b),(c ) and [ fig-2d - surface - aa - ad - x0](e),(f ) ) , but different spatial distributions .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath251 and @xmath252 is such that the positive and negative contributions with similar magnitudes of @xmath251 and @xmath252 cancel out in the computation of their formal integrals .",

    "again , @xmath250 does not show significant differences between the aa and the ad prd . for @xmath251 ,",
    "the aa prd has a distribution with positive and negative values equally distributed in the 2d slab but the ad prd has more negative contribution .",

    "the distribution of @xmath252 is positive almost everywhere , including the central parts of the 2d slab .",
    "such a spatial distribution reflects again in the average value of @xmath225 ( shown in figure  [ fig-2d - t20](b ) ) , where @xmath243_{\\rm aa}$ ] have smaller positive magnitudes ( due to cancellation effects ) than the corresponding @xmath243_{\\rm ad}$ ] .",
    "in this paper we have further generalized the fourier decomposition technique developed in paper iv to handle the ad prd in multi - d polarized rt ( see section  [ rteff ] ) . we have applied this technique and developed an efficient iterative method called pre - bicg - stab to solve this problem ( see section  [ numerics ] ) .",
    "we prove in this paper that the symmetry of the polarized radiation field with respect to the infinite axis , that exists for a non - magnetic 2d medium for the aa prd ( as shown in paper ii ) breaks down for the ad prd ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "we present results of the very first investigations of the effects of the ad prd on the polarized line formation in multi - d media .",
    "we restrict our attention to freestanding 2d slabs with finite optical thicknesses on the two axes ( @xmath119 and @xmath27 ) .",

    "we consider effects of the ad prd on the scattering polarization in both non - magnetic and magnetic cases .",
    "we find that the relative ad prd effects are prominent in the magnetic case ( hanle effect ) .",
    "they are also present in non - magnetic case for some choices of @xmath194 .",
    "we conclude that the ad prd effects are important for interpreting the observations of scattering polarization in multi - d structures on the sun .",
