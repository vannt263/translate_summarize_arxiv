    "the genetic information in eukaryotic cells ( including cells of animals and plants ) is accessed through dna unwinding on two different length scales . on the larger scale",
    "the dna double helix has to unwind from proteins , on the smaller scale the two strands of the double helix need to be separated . in the first case a semiflexible polymer ( dna double helix ) is wound almost two turns around a protein cylinder forming the so - called nucleosome @xcite , in the second case two flexible polymers ( chains of nucleotides ) are twisted around each other leading to the much stiffer double helix .",
    "the unwinding of the dna from the nucleosome or the separation of the dna double helix is achieved inside a cell in various ways , often involving molecular motors ( chromatin remodellers , polymerases ... ) that usually give access through a local opening of the structures . inside a test tube unwinding",
    "can be induced , typically on a global scale , through a change in temperature ( dna melting / helix - coil transition @xcite ) , salt concentration ( salt - induced dna release @xcite ) or through application of an external force ( nucleosome unwrapping @xcite , dna unzipping @xcite ) .",
    "local unwinding can also occur spontaneously leading to the breathing of nucleosomes and of dna ( usually called site exposure in nucleosomes @xcite and denaturation bubbles in dna @xcite ) . finally , during transcription , where the elongating rna polymerase produces a rna transcript , one faces again the situation of a flexible chain , the transcript , being initially wound around the much stiffer dna double helix @xcite .    to gain insights into the unwinding process it is convenient to start from simple setups .",
    "in this work we study the unwinding process of an idealized flexible polymer model that is initially wound around a stiff rod , in a configuration of minimal entropy , which resembles some of the features of the dna or rna unwinding .",
    "this model was introduced and studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we extend the results of that analysis focusing in particular on metric properties .",
    "we present a scaling argument which fully captures the early stages of the dynamics that is characterized by power - law scaling . despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", there is a complex dynamical behavior .",
    "it is the entropy gain that drives the polymer from the initial configuration toward the full random coil configuration .",
    "a sketch of this process is given in figure  [ fig:1 ] , which shows different snapshots of the polymer configurations in the course of a simulation .",
    "the polymer is initially fully wound in a helix around the rigid rod .",
    "one end of the polymer is tethered to the rod whereas the other end is free , hence the relaxation proceeds from the free end .",
    "this process shares some similarities with the simpler problem of the relaxation from one end of a completely stretched polymer @xcite .",
    "consider a polymer tethered at one end and fully stretched by a strong flow .",
    "when the flow is turned off the polymer relaxes back to its coiled equilibrium conformation . as one end is tethered the relaxation starts from a free end , from where the coil grows .",
    "the unwinding has a similar relaxation from the free end which occurs through a rotational motion instead of a translational recoiling .",
    "however , the phenomenology in the case of unwinding is much richer , as we will show .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section models and simulations , we review the models and the type of monte carlo simulations used . in the section results and discussion ,",
    "we focus first on the early unwinding dynamics which is characterized by power - laws scaling in time .",
    "it is shown that force balance equations and scaling arguments yield exponents in very good agreement with simulations .",
    "second , we discuss the late stage of the relaxation process . here the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts a power - law scaling for the longest relaxation time with logarithmic corrections .",
    "the analysis is extended to other lattice and off - lattice models and the results confirm the validity of the theory .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows different snapshots of the polymer configurations during the unwinding from an infinitely long rod . initially the polymer is fully wound and in the course of time it unwraps . the polymer has @xmath0 monomers labeled with indices @xmath1 .",
    "one end ( @xmath2 ) is fixed to the rod , while the other end ( @xmath3 ) is free .",
    "we have studied different cases to check the robustness and universality of the numerical results . for the ideal chain ( the case without excluded volume )",
    "we modeled the polymer in three different ways . in a first model we considered a random walk ( rw ) with unit steps on a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice . in the initial helical configuration ,",
    "the polymer performs one turn in six steps along the rod .",
    "an update of the configuration consists of @xmath0 attempts of so - called corner flips , where the randomly selected monomer is moved to a neighboring lattice site if the distances to the neighboring monomers are conserved ( this is a lattice realization of rouse dynamics  @xcite ) . the new configuration is accepted if the monomer does not overlap with the rod .",
    "we also considered a random walk on a square lattice ( i.e. , a bidimensional lattice ) . in this case",
    "the starting configuration consists of a chain with a rescaled segment length wound around the origin . in the initial configuration on the square lattice one turn around the origin",
    "is performed by @xmath4 monomers .",
    "the corner flip method is used here as well .    finally , we used a freely jointed chain ( fjc ) to model three - dimensional off - lattice polymers .",
    "neighboring monomers have a fixed distance @xmath5 from each other and the rod has a diameter @xmath6 ensuring that monomers can not accidentally pass from one side to the other in the course of unwinding .",
    "the initial helical configuration is such that one turn is performed with @xmath7 monomers .",
    "also in this case a time step of the dynamics consists in @xmath0 attempts of moves for randomly chosen monomers . when a monomer is selected , a new configuration is constructed via a rotation of that monomer around the axis defined by the two neighboring monomers by an angle randomly selected from @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the free end is updated with a new random position preserving the bond length with the second monomer .",
    "the new configuration is accepted if it does not overlap with the rod .",
    "for the case of a polymer with excluded volume we use only the model of a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on the fcc lattice .",
    "the procedure is the same as for the ideal chain on the fcc lattice , with the added constraint of excluded volume between the monomers : one rejects moves violating it .",
    "we consider first the  radial \" distance @xmath9 which is defined as the average distance of the free end monomer from the rod . this quantity is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] ( rw s ) and  [ fig:3 ] ( saw ) .",
    "starting from a minimal value for the fully wrapped configuration at @xmath10 the growth of @xmath9 follows a power law . in the ideal chain cases we find a first , short - time , regime : @xmath11 this scaling with time of a spatial length scale is remarkably slow ( @xmath12 ) compared to the usual relaxation time scales encountered in polymer physics .",
    "the exponent is robust and is found in the minimalistic 2d polymer on a square lattice ( figure  [ fig:2](a ) ) , the rw on a fcc lattice ( figure  [ fig:2](b ) ) and the freely jointed chain off - lattice ( figure  [ fig:2](c ) ) .",
    "we performed also simulations for a 3d excluded volume chain on an fcc lattice , for which we find a power law with a slightly larger exponent : @xmath13 as it can be seen in figure  [ fig:3 ] .     of the free end from the rod versus time for a excluded volume chain on an fcc lattice .",
    "the short time regime follows the power law @xmath14 .",
    "the inset shows the scaling of @xmath15 with the polymer length .",
    "averages are made at least over @xmath16 configurations ( for the largest size).,width=264 ]    to understand the origin of this exponent we model the unwinding starting from a two phase picture .",
    "we assume that during the early stage of the dynamics the polymer starting from the fixed end has @xmath17 monomers tightly wrapped around the rod , which are frozen as in their initial @xmath10 configuration , while @xmath18 monomers are loose ( we indicate these as phase 1 and phase 2 , respectively , see figure  [ fig : config](a ) ) .",
    "we assume that the loose monomers form a homogeneous helix with a constant pace , but which is loosely wrapped around the rod .",
    "obviously , if the loose helix would extend until the free end of the polymer , the radial distance @xmath9 would not grow in time .",
    "the two phase model is the starting point of our analysis and we will focus on the configuration of the polymer close to the free end later .",
    "we assume that the dynamics is governed by the following equation : @xmath19 which is a balance between frictional and `` entropic '' forces during the growth of the helical domain . here",
    "@xmath20 is the total free energy of the configuration , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 the free energies per monomer of the two phases ( with @xmath23 as the loose helix has a higher entropy than the tight helix ) .",
    "@xmath24 is the friction coefficient .",
    "the total winding angle of the last monomer is equal to @xmath25 times the number of times the polymer is wrapped around the rod .",
    "for the two helices model such a quantity is then given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the densities of winding for the two phases ( with @xmath29 , as phase 2 is more loosely wrapped compared to phase 1 ) .",
    "a decrease in @xmath17 leads to a decrease in the total winding angle and the whole loose helix rotates in a corkscrew motion .",

    "note that the assumption can be relaxed , allowing phase 2 to have fluctuations ; the only essential requirement is that the friction @xmath24 should scale linearly with the length of the domain .",
    "our approximation is similar in spirit to the monoblock approximation where an inhomogeneously stretched polymer is modeled by a homogeneously stretched one , an approximation that does not change the scaling of the large scale geometry of the deformed chain  @xcite .     at the polymer end .",

    "if the polymer is sufficiently short and @xmath34 small , its equilibrium conformation is not perturbed by the rotation and in particular it will have no winding ( figure  [ fig : config](c ) ) .",
    "if the polymer length exceeds a given threshold value , then part of the polymer close to the attachment point gets wound while the final part rotates maintaining its equilibrium shape ( length of the part ab in figure  [ fig : config](d ) ) .",
    "we estimate now the length of the end coil for a rotating polymer . to understand the calculation it is useful to consider the analogous problem of a polymer pulled by one end by a constant force  @xcite .",
