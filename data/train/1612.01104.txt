    "natural systems can undergo sudden , large and irreversible changes under the influence of small stochastic perturbations @xcite . such qualitative sudden changes are known as `` regime shifts '' have been found in a variety of ecological systems @xcite , climate systems @xcite , biological systems @xcite , financial markets @xcite , physical systems @xcite , etc .",
    "it has been identified that regime shifts generally occur at tipping points ( namely bifurcation points ) @xcite , where the system abruptly shifts from one stable state to another stable state .",
    "there are also examples of purely noise induced regime shifts ( known as stochastic switching ) @xcite .",
    "regime shifts have the potential to invoke serious and harmful consequences for environment as well as human well - being @xcite .",
    "understanding the mechanisms of regime shifts and predicting them using early warning signals ( ews ) have been recently emerged as a challenging area of research due to the potential application in management and prevention of sudden catastrophes in complex systems .",
    "numerous studies have been carried out to develop ews for successfully predicting regime shifts @xcite .",
    "extensive research on ews suggests that statistical signatures , such as concurrent increase in `` variance '' , `` autocorrelation '' , `` skewness '' can predict regime shifts in a wide variety of complex systems @xcite .",
    "these ews are mainly derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down , which is associated with a tipping point at which the stability of an equilibrium state changes as the dominant real eigenvalue becomes zero @xcite . as a result ,",
    "rate of recovery from small stochastic perturbations becomes slow as the system approaches a tipping point , resulting concurrent increase in variance , autocorrelation and skewness prior to a regime shift .",
    "however , sometimes these ews are not present before a regime shift due to statistical limitations and confer false alarms @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , apart from the aforementioned indicators , other indicators , e.g. ,  conditional heteroskedasticity \" @xcite can be very useful to detect regime shifts .",
    "conditional heteroskedasticity is used to investigate the possible links between time series data and their volatilities @xcite .",
    "this indicator generally avoids the chance of false alarms as it is associated with significant test and their probabilities .",
    "majority of the earlier studies on predicting regime shifts using ews have focused on the ecological and climate systems @xcite .",
    "however , few recent studies have reported the huge potential of ews as risk markers from molecular biology to chronic human diseases @xcite .",
    "regime shifts those arise in medical conditions can increase the risk of diseases and even result in sudden death @xcite .",
    "recently , ews for detecting regime shifts in ecology have got special attention in medical sciences @xcite .",
    "the ability to predict such regime shifts could prove fruitful in early detection of diseases @xcite .",
    "an important example of regime shift in molecular biology is genetic regulatory system , which includes sudden transition in protein production level in individual cells resulting disease onset @xcite . in genetically identical cells fluctuations in transcription and translation",
    "give rise to regime shifts between alternative states ( i.e. , phenotypic variability ) in intracellular protein concentrations @xcite .",
    "indeed , in positive - feedback regulation individual cells can exist in different steady states , some live in the `` on '' expression state and others live in the `` off '' expression state @xcite .",
    "these `` on '' and `` off '' states are mainly related with protein production .",
    "also , the cells perform a range of specialized functions for protein production that depend upon gene expression states . for instance , @xmath0 cells in the pancreas produce the protein hormone insulin that depends upon hla - encoding gene states , @xmath1 cells produce the hormone glucagon , lymphocytes of the immune system produce antibodies - proteins ( gamma globulin s ) , while developing red blood cells produce the oxygen - transport protein hemoglobin . finding the causes of regime shift and predicting that a cell is about to shift to a harmful gene expression state can improve critical care management for complex human diseases .    in previous studies ,",
    "the stochastic fluctuations associated with gene expression are considered as gaussian white noise ( noise with zero correlation time ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , few recent studies have shown that gene expression noise can also be colored in nature ( noise with non - zero correlation time ) @xcite .",
    "these studies have measured the variability of protein levels in human cellular system and showed that cell to cell variability of protein levels can be correlated over generations @xcite .",
    "it has also been measured experimentally that gene expression noise has a finite correlation time @xcite . moreover , colored noise can break bistability in different ways than that of white noise @xcite . in order to address these issues , it is important to study the effects of noise correlation on regime shifts in gene expression .    one of the key questions addressed in this paper is : how the dynamic correlation in gene expression noise affects the characteristics of sudden regime shifts between alternative steady states ( i.e. , low and high protein concentration states ) ? for this , we begin with a stochastic version of gene regulatory system : a genetic autoactivating switch .",
    "the colored noise is modeled using ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "we compute the stochastic potential and the stationary probability density function to quantify the effects of noise intensity and correlation time on the relative stability of alternative steady states using fokker - planck description .",
    "we then obtain the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) for escape over the potential barrier .",
    "we show that increase in the noise correlation time in degradation rate can induce a regime shift from low to high protein concentration state and enhance the bistable regime , while noise in basal rate retain the bimodal distribution of the system steady states .",
    "we also show that cross - correlated colored noises in basal and degradation rates can induce regime shifts from low to high protein concentration state , however reduce the bistable regime .",
    "further , we examine ews prior to a regime shift in gene expression dynamics , which can prove to be very useful to predict that a cell is about to shift to a harmful phenotype .    the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec:2 ] presents the description of a stochastic model of gene expression . in sec .",
