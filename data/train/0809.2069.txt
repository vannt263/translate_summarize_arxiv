    "in 1873 , j. bertrand@xcite published a short but important paper in which he proved that there are only two central fields for which all orbits radially bounded are closed , namely : the isotropic harmonic oscillator field , and the gravitational one .",
    "because of this additional degeneracy  in the language of modern group theory we associated the unitary group @xmath0 with the harmonic oscillator and the orthogonal group @xmath1 with the gravitational potential  it is no wonder that the properties of those two fields have been under close scrutiny since newton s times .",
    "newton addresses to the isotropic harmonic oscillator in proposition x book i of the _ principia _ , and to the inverse - square law in proposition xi @xcite .",
    "newton shows that both fields give rise to elliptical orbits with the difference that in the first case the force is directed toward the geometrical center of the ellipse and in the second case the force is directed to one of the foci .",
    "bertrand s proof is concise , elegant , and , contrary to what one may be led to think by a number of perturbative demonstrations that can be found in textbooks and papers on the subject , fully non - perturbative . as examples of perturbative demonstrations",
    "the reader can consult references @xcite .",
    "we can also find in the literature demonstrations that resemble the spirit of bertrand s original work as for example @xcite .",
    "all perturbative demonstrations and most of the non - perturbative ones , however , have a restrictive feature , to wit , they set a limit on the number of possibilities of the existence of central fields with the property mentioned above to a finite number and finally show explicitly that among the surviving possibilities only two , the newtonian and the isotropic harmonic oscillator , are really possible .",
    "let us now outline briefly bertrand s approach to the problem . in his paper ,",
    "bertrand initially proves by taking into consideration the equal radii limit that a central force @xmath2 acting on a point - like body able of generating radially bounded orbits must necessarily be of the form    @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radial distance to the center of force , @xmath5 is a constant and @xmath6 a rational number .",
    "next , making use of this particular form of the law of force and considering also an additional limiting condition , bertrand finally shows that only for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which correspond to newton s gravitational law of force    @xmath9 and to the isotropic harmonic oscillator law of force    @xmath10 respectively , we can have orbits with the properties stated in the theorem .",
    "moreover , bertrand can also prove that only for these laws of force all bounded orbits are closed . for more details the reader is referred to the original paper or to its english translation @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the issue from an alternative point of view .",
    "this alternative approach stems from a different kind of question that we can ask ourselves . for radially bounded orbits",
    "there are two extreme values for the possible radii , namely , a maximum and a minimum one .",
    "these extreme values were named by newton himself superior apse and inferior apse , respectively , or briefly , apses .",
    "the angular displacement between these two successive points or apses defines the apsidal angle @xmath11 . in a central field of force",
    ", the apsidal angle depends on the total mechanical energy @xmath12 and the magnitude of the angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the question we can formulate is the following : _ for what potentials the apsidal angle has the same value for all orbits  that is for arbitrary energy and angular momentum  and what is its value ? _",
    "the answer as we will show in the next sections is that the apsidal angle is constant for only two potentials : the newtonian and the isotropic harmonic oscillator one , and consequently as a corollary we have an alternative and non - perturbative proof of bertrand s theorem .",
    "in a central field , in which the magnitude of the force @xmath14 depends only on the distance @xmath15 to the center of force , we can introduce the potential function @xmath16 with the property @xmath17 such that the total mechanical energy @xmath12 of a particle with mass @xmath18 orbiting in this field is a constant of motion .",
    "thus we write @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity of the particle .",
    "moreover , the conservation of the angular momentum @xmath21 of the particle in a central field constrains its motion to a fixed plane and allows for the introduction of an effective potential defined by @xmath22 with the help of which it is possible to reduce the motion to an equivalent unidimensional problem .",
    "let us define for convenience the variable @xmath23 and the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 in such a way that the effective potential ( [ xref - equation-82110330 ] ) is now written @xmath26 let us also assume that the effective potential ( [ xref - equation-82110427 ] ) has a minimum at @xmath27 , such that the particle can move in a circular orbit with radius @xmath28 .",
    "this particular value of @xmath29 is determined by the condition @xmath30 from which we obtain    @xmath31    taking this result into the effective potential ( [ xref - equation-82110427 ] ) we can write    @xmath32    in this way we see that the first derivative of the effective potential at the point @xmath33 is zero for each and every potential function @xmath34 .",
    "this means that the vanishing of this derivative does not impose restrictions of any kind on the potential function @xmath34 .",
    "the second derivative at the point @xmath33 is    @xmath35    if @xmath36 is zero for an arbitrary point @xmath37 , we see that the potential must be of the form @xmath38 , and in this case the force must be of the form @xmath39 .",
    "newton in the proposition ix of book i of the principia shows that in this case the orbit is an equiangular spiral and therefore without apsidal points .",
    "hence , in what follows we will suppose that the second derivative of the effective potential is not null .",
    "if now we assume that @xmath40 and @xmath29 are complex variables and perform an analytical continuation of the function @xmath41 we can determine the inverse function @xmath42 by applying the generalization of the brmann - lagrange series for a multivalued inverse function @xcite . with this purpose in mind",
    "we choose the point @xmath43 as the point around which we will perform the expansion of this function .",
    "the result is @xmath44_{\\zeta = z_0}\\,\\left(u - u_0\\right)^{n/2 } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath45 } ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } , \\label{chi}\\ ] ] and @xmath46 is a first order algebraic branching point of the function @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that we can define two real inverse functions of the function @xmath48 ; the first one is @xmath49 which holds for @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) .",
    "the second one is @xmath52 which holds for @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) , and where we have written for convenience @xmath55 it is also convenient to write the function ( [ chi ] ) in the form @xmath56 which can be obtained by making use of ( [ uu ] ) .",
    "for radially bounded orbits the two extreme values for the radii , namely , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , maximum and minimum ( or @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , respectively are determined by the condition @xmath61 , or @xmath62 . the particle oscillates indefinitely between @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in terms of the effective potential radially closed orbits",
    "are characterized by extreme points that satisfy the condition @xmath63 , or @xmath64 .",
    "for convenience we take the direction defined by the arbitrary vector @xmath65 as the reference for the measure of angular displacements . hence , the angular displacement between two successive apses .",
    "that is , the apsidal angle @xmath66 , can be written in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the angular displacement from the point @xmath65 to the point @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the angular displacement to the apsidal point @xmath71 .    the angular displacement in a central field of force",
    "can be easily determined from the conservation laws of the mechanical energy and the angular momentum .",
    "hence we can write @xmath72 and @xmath73 making use of the inverse functions ( [ xref - equation-821154818 ] ) and ( [ xref - equation-821154910 ] ) we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 the integrals in equations ( [ xref - equation-82214290 ] ) and ( [ xref - equation-822142931 ] ) can be evaluated with the help of    @xmath76 where    @xmath77 which holds for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , see @xcite , formula 3.196.3 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath81 and @xmath82    notice that the first term in the first summation is the only one that does not depend on the energy .",
    "notice also that the constants @xmath83 do not depend on the energy as well . after adding equations ( [ xref - equation-822152230 ] ) and ( [ xref - equation-822152316 ] ) we obtain for the apsidal angle the expression @xmath84 notice that this series does not depend on the even coefficients .",
    "equations ( [ xref - equation-822152230 ] ) , ( [ xref - equation-822152316 ] ) , and ( [ apsidal angle ] ) are our main results and in the next section we will use them to answer the question we posed at the beginning of this work , to wit : for what potentials the apsidal angle has the same value for all orbits , i.e. : for arbitrary values of the energy and angular momentum , and what value does it assumes .",
    "let us begin by looking for potentials that keep the partial angles @xmath85 and @xmath86 separately constant . if this happens to be so , the apsidal angle @xmath87 will also be constant for any value of the energy and the angular momentum . in order to accomplish that it is necessary that for @xmath88 all coefficients @xmath83 in equations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) be equal to zero .",
    "after evaluating the coefficient @xmath89 and setting it equal to zero we obtain @xmath90 , and taking into account that @xmath37 is an arbitrary point it follows that @xmath91 the general solution of ( [ vdiff ] ) is @xmath92 the integration constant @xmath93 is an additive term to the potential and can be discarded without loss of generality .",
    "the second derivative of the effective potential at the stationary point is @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that @xmath37 is effectively a minimum only if the constant @xmath95 is negative and this corresponds to an attractive field . for a potential function of the form given by ( [ xref - equation-822154852 ] ) we can evaluate the function @xmath96 given by ( [ chi 2 ] ) to obtain @xmath97",
    "hence the only non - zero coefficient is @xmath98 , because the function @xmath96 , for this potential , does not depend on @xmath99 and therefore @xmath100 @xmath101 .",
    "evaluating the first coefficient for this potential we obtain @xmath102    for a fixed value of the angular momentum any potential of the form given by ( [ xref - equation-822154852 ] ) generates bounded orbits with equal and constant angles @xmath85 and @xmath86 and thus the apsidal angle @xmath87 as defined by ( [ theapsidalangle ] ) will also be constant .",
    "moreover , if only the constant @xmath103 vanishes , that is , if the potential is of the form @xmath104 , it is possible to obtain a potential for which the apsidal angle is also independent of the angular momentum .",
    "this potential corresponds to the newtonian one , the apsidal angle is @xmath105 and the orbits are closed .",
    "the vector @xmath106 is perpendicular to the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which in their turn are antiparallel vectors with respect to each other defining in this way only one symmetry axis of the trajectory of the particle .",
    "let us now look for potentials that keep the apsidal angle @xmath109 constant . in order to accomplish this",
    "it is necessary that all the odd coefficients @xmath110 starting from the third one be zero . as before we begin by explicitly calculating the lowest order coefficient , namely @xmath111 . evaluating this coefficient , setting it equal to zero , and considering the arbitrariness of @xmath37 we obtain the following differential equation @xmath112 v^{\\left ( iv \\right ) } ( z ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{masterdiffeq1}\\ ] ] writing the function @xmath34 as @xmath113    we can recast ( [ masterdiffeq1 ] ) into the form @xmath114 -\\frac{\\frac{d}{d z } [ \\frac{1}{z}\\frac{d}{d z } [ z \\varphi ( z ) ] ] } { \\frac{1}{z}\\frac{d}{d z } [ z \\varphi ( z ) ] } = 0 .",
    "\\label{masterdiffeq2}\\ ] ] equation ( [ masterdiffeq2 ] ) can be immediately integrated and its general solution is    @xmath115    where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are arbitrary constants .",
    "notice now that the newtonian potential analyzed before , which is a solution of ( [ vdiff ] ) , is also necessarily solution of ( [ masterdiffeq1 ] ) as can be immediately verified .",
    "such a solution can be obtained from ( [ mastersolution ] ) by setting @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , without any loss of generality we suppose @xmath119 and for convenience recast ( [ mastersolution ] ) into the form    @xmath120    where @xmath121 and @xmath95 are new constants .",
    "we write @xmath122 in order to assure that the function @xmath123 , and consequently the corresponding potential function , does not become ill - defined in the region around @xmath124 . making use of ( [ fi ] ) and ( [ integralsolution ] ) we can determine the potential function @xmath34 . for @xmath125",
    "we obtain    @xmath126    and for @xmath127    @xmath128    the constant @xmath129 is a simple shift of the zero of the potential and does not influence the law of force .",
    "considering first the potential given by ( [ sol1 ] ) and evaluating the second derivative of the effective potential at the stationary point we obtain    @xmath130    it follows that we will have a minimum only if @xmath131 . making use of ( [ chi 2 ] )",
    "we have    @xmath132    performing the analytical continuation of ( [ chi 3 ] ) and making use of the cauchy formula we obtain from ( [ cn ] )    @xmath133    the integral in ( [ cn1 ] ) can be easily evaluated by making the transformation @xmath134 in the neighborhood of @xmath37 .",
    "it follows then    @xmath135    the residue of ( [ cn2 ] ) is obviously null if @xmath136 is an odd integer greater than one .",
    "therefore , we can be sure that all potentials given by ( [ sol1 ] ) generate orbits for which the apsidal angles depend only on the angular momentum .",
    "the apsidal angle for this class of potentials follows from ( [ apsidal angle ] ) and is given by    @xmath137    in order to have an apsidal angle not dependent on the angular momentum it is necessary that the constant @xmath93 be set equal to zero .",
    "this will lead us to potentials of the form    @xmath138    which corresponds to the isotropic harmonic oscillator . in this case",
    "( [ apsidal angle 2 ] ) yields @xmath139 and , therefore , the orbit is closed .",
    "finally let us consider the potential given by ( [ sol2 ] ) for which the effective potential reads    @xmath140    the second derivative of @xmath141 at @xmath37 is easily evaluated and the result is    @xmath142    we can see that only for @xmath143 we will have a minimum and in what follows will show that this must indeed be the case here . making use of ( [ chi 2 ] )",
    "we obtain after some algebraic manipulations    @xmath144    next we consider the analytical continuation of this function . the complex function given by ( [ cf1 ] )",
    "has algebraic branching points at @xmath145 and @xmath146 and is defined on a four - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "hence we choose a sheet on this riemann surface such that the functions @xmath147 does not have branch points at @xmath148 and with a branch cut along the imaginary axis from @xmath149 to @xmath150 .",
    "notice that in this case the numerator of ( [ cf1 ] ) does not have zeroes . making use of cauchy formula",
    "we can write    @xmath151    where we have defined    @xmath152    and @xmath153 is a small closed path encircling the point @xmath37 .",
    "the integrand in equation ( [ cfd1 ] ) has another pole at the point @xmath154 .",
    "then , choosing the path indicated in figure ( [ contour ] ) the following results can be easily obtained    @xmath155    if @xmath156 ;    @xmath157    and @xmath158 finally , the integral over the finite parts of the real axis and the imaginary axis , see figure ( [ contour ] ) , cancel out",
    ". then we have    @xmath159    for @xmath156 .",
    "we can easily prove by making the substitution @xmath160 in the second integral above that @xmath161 \\int \\limits_{\\zeta = z_0 } \\vartheta^n ( \\zeta ) d\\zeta = 0 , \\ ] ] and therefore we conclude that    @xmath162    if @xmath136 is an odd integer greater than one .",
    "the last step is the evaluation of the apsidal angle for this case .",
    "making use of ( [ xref - equation-821105340 ] ) and ( [ uz ] ) we have    @xmath163 \\nonumber \\\\    &   = & m\\left [   \\frac { a\\left ( 2z_0 ^ 2   + b \\right ) } { b^2 z_0 \\sqrt { z_0 ^ 2   + b } }    - 2c \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    taking this result into ( [ apsidal angle ] ) we obtain    @xmath164 }   .\\ ] ]    the potentials given by ( [ sol2 ] ) generate orbits for which the apsidal angles depend only on the angular momentum . in this third case",
    "it is not possible to find constants @xmath95 and @xmath93 in such a way that those angles do not depend also on the angular momentum .",
    "in this work we have introduced a novel method for the determination of the apsidal angle in an arbitrary central field of force . for this reason equation ( [ apsidal angle ] ) should be considered as the main result of this paper . from this equation",
    "we have discussed the conditions under which the apsidal angles remain independent of the energy and angular momentum and consequently lead to bounded and closed orbits , and we have found that only the newtonian and the isotropic oscillator potentials present such behavior . moreover , from equation ( [ apsidal angle ] ) we have also calculated explicitly the value of their associated apsidal angles and have found the well - known results @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively .",
    "we can see also that these two special fields are strongly determined by the dependence of the centrifugal potential on @xmath167 . as a consequence , we have re - obtained bertrand s theorem in an alternative but non - perturbative way . after more than one hundred years since its publication bertrand s",
    "theorem still fascinates us @xcite .",
    "any serious student of classical mechanics sooner or later will become at least intrigued by it .",
    "no wonder that alternative proofs some of them very interesting ",
    "see for instance the phase space approach in @xcite or the hamiltonian one in @xcite  were offered in the past and nowadays .",
    "we have also obtained a third potential which we can lay aside because it does not meet the conditions that lead to bounded closed orbits .",
    "the analytical function techniques applied to the problem of finding the only central fields that allow an entire class of bounded , closed orbits with a minimum number of restrictions lead in a concise , straightforward way directly to the two allowed fields .",
    "it is also worth to mention that , as far as the present authors are aware of is one of the few examples of the usefulness of the brmann - lagrange theorem in its most general formulation .",
    "equation ( [ apsidal angle ] ) seems promising and its applications go beyond the rederivation of bertrand s results .",
    "in fact , it can be taken as the starting point in the discussion of problems related to precession phenomena .",
    "work by the present authors in this direction is in progress and results will be published elsewhere .",
