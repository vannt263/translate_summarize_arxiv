    "in its simplest form , the wavefunction of a quantum many - particle fermionic system can be written as a slater determinant that satisfies the anti - symmetry requirements and consequently the pauli principle . however , some corrections in the wavefunctions are usually necessary which are caused by their possible mixing . in nuclei , for example , corrections arise from the residual interaction between the particles of the system , with the consequence that the wavefunctions of all the states are strongly mixed . another source is the interaction between system and environment into which the system is embedded . in this case , the states of the system interact via the common environment due to which their wavefunctions may be modified .",
    "the natural environment of a localized quantum mechanical system is the extended continuum of scattering wavefunctions in which the system is embedded .",
    "this environment can be changed by means of external forces , however it can never be deleted .",
    "it causes some communication between distant levels , for details see the recent review @xcite in which theoretical results are confronted with experimental results .",
    "the theoretical results are obtained by using a non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath0 for the description of the system , which contains explicitly the interaction between system and environment @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath0 differ essentially from those of a hermitian hamilton operator : the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal and the eigenvalues may show , as function of a certain parameter , deviations from fermi s golden rule .",
    "the differences between the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath0 and those of a hermitian operator @xmath1 appear , above all , at and near to singular points at which two eigenvalues of @xmath0 coalesce and the corresponding eigenfunctions differ from one another only by a phase .",
    "these singular points do not have any equivalent in the mathematics based on hermitian hamiltonians since the different eigenfunctions of @xmath1 are orthogonal ( in contrast to those of @xmath0 , which are biorthogonal ) .",
    "these singular points are called usually exceptional points ( eps ) , according to @xcite .    the role of eps in physical systems",
    "is considered in many papers during last years , e.g. @xcite , see also the review @xcite and the book @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we are interested in the relation of these singular points to phase transitions occurring in open quantum systems .",
    "such a relation is first discussed theoretically some years ago in @xcite and @xcite , however without rigorous consideration of the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions of @xmath0 .",
    "the same holds true for the papers @xcite on the dynamical phase transition observed experimentally and theoretically in the spin swapping operation in atomic systems .",
    "only recently , the mixing of the wavefunctions at an ep and its relation to a dynamical phase transition is studied for an open quantum system with more than two states @xcite .",
    "the states at both sides of the phase transition are not analytically related to one another , meaning that this characteristic feature of any phase transition is fulfilled .",
    "the theoretical results are compared to experimental results in the recent review @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these differences between hermitian and non - hermitian quantum physics at and near to an ep , the hamilton operator of the schrdinger equation of an open quantum system is almost hermitian , to a good approximation , far from an ep . here",
    "the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian hamilton operator are almost orthogonal @xcite ; and the system can be described quite well by a standard hermitian hamilton operator .",
    "we underline however that the hamiltonian remains definitely non - hermitian since the non - hermiticity arises solely from the fact that the function space of the localized part of the system is a subsystem of the total function space : the localized part , we are interested in , is embedded into an extended environment of scattering wavefunctions , see fig . 1 in @xcite",
    ". the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator are always biorthogonal @xcite ( see also sect . 3.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this includes the case with well - separated resonance states as shown theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to consider the influence of eps onto the eigenfunctions ( including their phases ) of a non - hermitian hamiltonian in detail .",
    "we are interested , above all , in the behavior of the eigenfunctions and their phases in approaching an ep and , furthermore , in the role they play in a dynamical phase transition .",
    "first , we sketch in sect .",
    "[ eigen ] the characteristic features of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian 2x2 hamiltonian which are known in literature , and provide the definitions of typical values such as , among others , the phase rigidity .",
    "this is a quantitative expression for the biorthogonality of the wavefunction and thus , ultimately , of the degree of opening of the system .    in the following sect .",
    "[ eps ] we consider the conditions for the appearance of eps in different systems consisting of two states .",

    "[ num ] we provide numerical results for systems under typical conditions and compare them with analytical results , if such results exist .",
    "we discuss the obtained results in sect .",
    "some of the results are expected and agree with our general understanding of open quantum systems .",
    "other results are completely unexpected .",
    "these results are considered and discussed in detail .",
    "they allow us to receive a deeper understanding of dynamical phase transitions .",
    "we conclude the paper with some remarks on the stabilization of open quantum systems due to the existence of eps ; and discuss the possibility to describe them by means of a hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "in order to study the interaction of two states via the common environment it is most convenient to start from the symmetric @xmath3 non - hermitian matrix @xcite @xmath4 with @xmath5 for decaying states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 stand for the coupling matrix elements of the two states via the common environment which are , generally , complex @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath7 of ( [ form1 ] ) contain the energies @xmath8 and decay widths @xmath9 of the two states when @xmath10 , i.e. they are the two complex eigenvalues @xmath11 of the non - hermitian operator @xmath12 that describes the system without any coupling of its states via the environment . in the present paper , we take @xmath6 , and the self - energy of the states",
    "is assumed to be included into @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we underline here that the hamiltonian @xmath2 is completely non - hermitian ( see also @xcite ) in difference to the many non - hermitian operators used in the literature for the description of open quantum systems .",
    "these operators consist mostly of a hermitian part to which a non - hermitian part is added as a perturbation .",
    "the model ( [ form1 ] ) seems to be very simple .",
    "this is however not true from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the point is that singularities are involved in the model ( the so - called eps ) which are known in mathematics for many years , see [ 3 ] . they are considered in physics only recently .",
    "they cause counterintuitive results @xcite which seem to be , at first glance , wrong",
    ". we will discuss them in the following .    in the case",
    "@xmath15 , the real part @xmath16 of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 does not differ from the original energies @xmath17 .",
    "it follows , under this condition , @xmath18 .",
    "a corresponding relation holds for the @xmath19 relative to the original @xmath20 .",
    "most interesting properties of @xmath2 are the crossing points of two eigenvalue trajectories .",
    "since here the two states coalesce at one point , the influence of all the other states of the system on the interaction of these two states can be neglected .",
    "therefore , ( [ form1 ] ) describes the characteristics of open quantum systems that may be related to these points , in spite of its small rank .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath2 are , generally , complex and may be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for the energy and width , respectively , of the eigenstate @xmath24 .",
    "also here @xmath25 for decaying states @xcite .",
    "the two states may repel each other in accordance with re@xmath26 , or they may undergo width bifurcation in accordance with im@xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 the two states cross each other at a point that is called usually _ exceptional point _ ( ep ) @xcite .",
    "the ep is a singular point ( branch point ) in the complex plane where the @xmath28-matrix has a double pole @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions of any non - hermitian operator @xmath0 must fulfill the conditions @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an eigenvalue of @xmath0 and the vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote its right and left eigenfunctions , respectively @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 is a hermitian operator , the @xmath31 are real , and we arrive at the well - known relation @xmath34 . in this case , the eigenfunctions can be normalized by using the expression @xmath35 .",
    "for the symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath2 , however , we have @xmath36 .",
    "this means , that the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal and have to be normalized by means of @xmath37 .",
    "this is , generally , a _ complex _",
    "value , in contrast to the real value @xmath35 of the hermitian case . to smoothly describe the transition from a closed system with discrete states , to a weakly open one with narrow resonance states",
    ", we normalize the @xmath38 according to @xmath39 ( for details see sects .",
    "2.2 and 2.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "it follows @xmath40 and @xmath41    at the eps , not only the eigenvalues of two states coalesce but also the two corresponding eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath2 are the same , up to a phase , @xmath42 these relations follow from analytical as well as from numerical and experimental studies , see appendix of @xcite , sect .",
    "2.5 of @xcite and figs . 4 and 5 in @xcite .",
    "we underline here that the coalescence of the two eigenvalues of a non - hermitian operator at an ep should not be confused with the well - known fact that two eigenstates of a hermitian operator may be degenerate .",
    "the difference consists in the relation ( [ eif5 ] ) between the two corresponding eigenfunctions which does , of course , not hold for degenerate states .",
    "furthermore , the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian operator are biorthogonal while those of degenerate states are orthogonal .",
    "according to ( [ eif5 ] ) , the wavefunction @xmath43 of the state @xmath44 jumps , at the ep , to  @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this mathematical behavior of the eigenfunctions @xmath38 at the singular eps causes the main differences between the physics of hermitian and non - hermitian quantum systems . at an ep , @xmath46 , and",
    "the influence of the environment onto the system is extremely large @xcite .    in ( [ int3 ] ) ,",
    "the complex value @xmath47 is normalized to the real value @xmath48 with the consequence that the relative phase between the biorthogonal eigenfunctions of two neighbored states changes in such a manner that always im@xmath49 .",
    "a quantitative measure of this change is the so - called _ phase rigidity _",
    "@xmath50 of the state @xmath51 which is defined by the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality of the wavefunctions @xmath52 .",
    "for hermitian systems for which @xmath53 holds , the phase rigidity is equal to unity .",
    "this is an expression of the fact that the eigenfunctions of hermitian operators are orthogonal . for weakly decaying systems , where one has well - separated resonance states , the wavefunctions are almost orthogonal , i.e. the degree of biorthogonality is small . under such conditions ,",
    "hermitian quantum physics represents a reasonable approximation to the description of the open quantum system .",
    "however , the wavefunction @xmath43 jumps at the ep to @xmath54 and vice versa ; and the phase rigidity does not vary continuously at the ep also in this case .    the schrdinger equation with the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath55 is equivalent to a schrdinger equation with @xmath12 and source term @xcite @xmath56 this equation relates @xmath38 to @xmath57 in a non - trivial manner due to the source term .",
    "that means , two states @xmath24 and @xmath58 are coupled via the common environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded .",
    "it is @xmath59 , and the coupling between the states @xmath24 and @xmath60 vanishes when @xmath61 .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ form1a ] ) with source term can be rewritten in the following manner @xcite , @xmath62 ) and ( [ int5 ] ) of the eigenfunctions of @xmath55 , ( [ form2a ] ) is a nonlinear equation , since @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "most important part of the nonlinear contributions is contained in @xmath67 the nonlinear source term vanishes far from an ep where @xmath68 approaches @xmath44 and @xmath69 approaches zero .",
    "this follows from the normalization ( [ int3 ] ) which differs only a little from the standard normalization @xmath70 and @xmath71 for a hermitian hamilton operator .",
    "thus , the schrdinger equation with source term is ( almost ) linear far from an ep , as usually assumed .",
    "it is however nonlinear in the neighborhood of an ep .",
    "the nonlinear terms in ( [ form3a ] ) cause , among others , a mixing of the wavefunctions which can be expressed by @xmath72 where the eigenfunctions @xmath52 of @xmath55 are represented in the set of basic wavefunctions @xmath73 of the operator @xmath12 the non - diagonal matrix elements of which vanish .",
    "for some numerical results see @xcite .",
    "this mixing of the wavefunctions appears _ additionally _ to other possible sources of mixing caused for some other reasons .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath38 and the eigenvalues @xmath31 of @xmath2 contain global features that are caused by many - body forces induced by the coupling @xmath74 of the states @xmath24 and @xmath75 via the environment .",
    "the environment is the continuum of scattering wavefunctions and has an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider now the behavior that arises when the parametrical detuning of the two eigenstates of @xmath2 is varied , bringing them towards coalescence .",
    "according to ( [ int6 ] ) , the condition for coalescence reads @xmath76 it follows that two interacting discrete states ( with @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) avoid always crossing since @xmath79 and @xmath80 are real in this case and the condition @xmath27 can not be fulfilled , @xmath81 in this case , the ep can be found only by analytical continuation into the continuum .",
    "this situation is called usually avoided crossing of discrete states .",
    "it holds also for narrow resonance states if @xmath27 can not be fulfilled due to the small widths of the two states .",
    "the physical meaning of this result is very well known since many years : the avoided crossing of two discrete states at a certain critical parameter value @xcite means that the two states are exchanged at this point , including their populations ( _ population transfer _ ) .",
    "when @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is _ imaginary _ , it follows from ( [ int6i ] ) @xmath84 such that two eps appear .",
    "it furthermore holds that @xmath85 independent of the parameter dependence of @xmath86 .",
    "also in the case when the widths @xmath87 are parameter dependent , @xmath88 and @xmath89 is _ real _ , we have two eps .",
    "instead of ( [ int6b ] ) to ( [ int6d ] ) we have @xmath90 and @xmath91    eqs .",
    "( [ int6c ] ) and ( [ int6f ] ) , respectively , describe the behavior away from the eps , where the eigenvalues @xmath92 only differ from the original ones through a contribution to the energy and width , respectively .",
    "the widths ( or energies ) , in contrast , remain unchanged , and this situation therefore corresponds to that of level repulsion ( or width bifurcation ) .",
    "( [ int6d ] ) and ( [ int6 g ] ) , in contrast , are relevant over the range between the two eps and indicate that the resonance states undergo width bifurcation ( or level repulsion ) according to im@xmath93 ( and re@xmath93 , respectively ) .",
    "the bifurcation ( or level repulsion ) starts in the neighborhood of either one of the eps , and grows to reach a maximum value at the midpoint between them ( even though @xmath94 and @xmath89 , respectively , remain fixed ) .",
    "the condition for maximum width bifurcation ( or level repulsion ) is fulfilled at the crossing point @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 , respectively ) .",
    "physically , the bifurcation implies that _ different time scales _ may appear in the system , while the states are nearby to one another in energy ( for details see @xcite ) . in an analogous manner ,",
    "level repulsion of states with similar lifetimes causes a _ separation of the states in energy_. for an illustration of these analytical results see the numerical results presented in sect .",
    "[ num2 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] left panel .    under more realistic conditions , @xmath89 is complex , and simple analytical results like ( [ int6b ] ) to ( [ int6 g ] ) can not be obtained . for this case",
    ", we will provide some results of numerical studies in sect .",
    "[ num2 ] . in order to understand the meaning of these numerical results , the analytical relations ( [ int6b ] ) to ( [ int6 g ] ) and their representation in figs . [ fig1 ] and fig . [ fig3 ] left panel are very helpful .    in any case",
    ", the parametric dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath97 is non - analytical in the vicinity of an ep , with the widths @xmath19 , in particular , showing variations that are inconsistent with the predictions of fermi s golden rule ( according to which the widths should increase with increasing coupling strength of the system to the environment ; for details see @xcite ) . at these points ,",
    "the influence of the environment onto the system properties is extremely strong . in our case , the environment is the continuum of scattering wavefunctions which gives to the eigenstates of @xmath2 a finite lifetime .",
    "it follows from the normalization condition ( [ int3 ] ) that @xmath98 such that @xmath99 @xcite when an ep is approached . in other words ,",
    "the relative phase of the two eigenfunctions changes dramatically when the crossing point is approached .",
    "most significantly , as understood from analytical studies , as well as from numerics and experiment ( see @xcite ) is , that , in the vicinity of the ep , the eigenfunctions differ from one another by only a phase , see ( [ eif5 ] ) . in a recent theoretical study on a microwave cavity @xcite ,",
    "the relations ( [ eif5 ] ) could be confirmed by the observation that the real and imaginary components of two nearby eigenstates are `` swapped '' , under the influence of an ep , in complete agreement with ( [ eif5 ] ) .",
    "the non - rigidity of the phases follows , of course , directly from the fact that @xmath100 is a complex number ( in difference to the norm @xmath101 , which is a real number ) so that the normalization condition ( [ int3 ] ) can be fulfilled only by the additional requirement im@xmath102 ( corresponding to a rotation away from the complex plane ) . here ,",
    "the two different states of the system develop , according to ( [ eif5 ] ) , a coupling through the continuum , a quantitative measure of which is the phase rigidity .",
    "thus , the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions @xmath52 causes perceptible physical effects in the neighborhood of an ep .    generally speaking",
    ", the phase rigidity takes values between zero and one , with the value @xmath103 for hermitian systems .",
    "near to an ep in a non - hermitian system , however , the two eigenfunctions differ from one another only by a phase , according to ( [ eif5 ] ) , so that @xmath104",
    ". this non - rigidity of the eigenfunction phases is the most important difference between hermitian and non - hermitian eigenfunctions .",
    "its meaning can not be overestimated .",
    "on the one hand , the lack of phase rigidity near to an ep leads very naturally to the appearance of nonlinear effects in the schrdinger equation ( [ form3a ] ) with source term which describes an open quantum system . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of the environment on the ( localized ) system is extremely strong at the ep .",
    "since the environment is the continuum of scattering wavefunctions with an infinite number of degrees of freedom , this impact may induce phase transitions as discussed in @xcite .",
    "according to mathematical studies , more than two eigenvalues of a non - hermitian operator @xmath0 may cross in one point , the so - called higher - order ep .",
    "this crossing point is however a point in the continuum and therefore of measure zero @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it does not differ from the second - order ep which is the crossing point of two eigenvalues considered in the foregoing sect .",
    "[ eigen ] .",
    "that means , a higher - order ep can _ not directly _ be identified in a realistic physical system .",
    "nevertheless , it influences the dynamics of an open quantum system in a similar manner as a second - order ep does ; see the discussion in the foregoing sect .",
    "[ eigen ] for a two - level system .    in @xcite , the influence of",
    "a _ third _ state onto the two eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator that cross at an ep , is investigated . as a result ,",
    "more than two states of a realistic physical system are unable to coalesce at one point since , in a certain finite parameter range around the original second - order ep , the wavefunctions of the two states are mixed . when the third state approaches this parameter range , it crosses or avoids crossing therefore with states that differ from the original two states .",
    "accordingly , new eps appear and the areas of influence of different eps overlap .",
    "altogether , the different eps amplify , collectively , their impact onto physical values ; and the wavefunctions of all states are strongly mixed in the basic wavefunctions @xmath105 of @xmath106 .",
    "this effect is nothing but some _ clustering of eps _ , wherewith the characteristic fact is expressed that the ranges of the influence of different second - order eps overlap in a finite parameter range around a higher - order ep .    in the following",
    ", we will study the mixing of the wavefunctions and , above all , the phase rigidity defined in , respectively , ( [ int20 ] ) and ( [ eif11 ] ) , in the case of clustering of eps . to this aim",
    "we consider the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath107 with @xmath108 or 4 nearby states coupled to one common continuum ( the first channel ) . as in ( [ form1 ] ) , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the energies and widths , respectively , of the @xmath109 states without account of the interaction of the different states via the environment .",
    "the @xmath110 simulate the interaction of the two states @xmath24 and @xmath111 via the common environment . in the simulation ( [ f1 ] )",
    ", we used the doorway concept used in nuclear physics : the @xmath109 states with the decay widths @xmath112 can be simulated by one doorway state with large decay width @xmath113 and @xmath114 states with small ( almost vanishing ) decay widths @xmath115 .",
    "then ( according to the doorway concept ) , the doorway state is coupled to both the environment and the remaining @xmath114 states , while the remaining states are coupled to the environment only via the doorway state ( due to their small decay widths and the fact that they are distant from eps ) .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath89 between system and environment is not varied in our calculations , and the number of parameters for the widths and energies of all @xmath109 states is @xmath116 @xcite .    the eigenvalues of ( [ f1 ] ) can be obtained in analogy to ( [ int6 ] ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal .",
    "we normalize them according to ( [ int3 ] ) .",
    "further ( [ eif5 ] ) holds at an ep .",
    "the values @xmath117 and @xmath118 defined in ( [ int4 ] ) and ( [ int5 ] ) , respectively , express how near the system is to an ep at the considered parameter value . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "these values can be seen directly by studying the mixing coefficients @xmath119 defined in ( [ int20 ] ) .",
    "also the corresponding phase rigidities @xmath120 of the different states can be determined numerically by using ( [ eif11 ] ) .    near to the different eps ,",
    "the schrdinger equation contains nonlinear contributions according to ( [ form3a ] ) due to the source term that describes the coupling between system and environment .",
    "accordingly , the whole parameter range in which a clustering of eps occurs , is controlled by nonlinear contributions to the schrdinger equation , the values of which vary because of their dependence on the concrete parameter value .",

    "the transition from @xmath99 ( at the ep ) to @xmath123 ( where width bifurcation and level repulsion , respectively , is maximum ) occurs suddenly as function of the varied parameter in _ all _ our calculations .",
    "the wavefunctions of the two states behave smoothly , i.e. they remain mixed also when @xmath123 .",
    "the physical meaning of this result consists in the fact that a stabilization of the localized part of the system occurs when the interaction @xmath89 between system and environment is strong enough , i.e. when it is of the same order of magnitude as the widths @xmath159 .",
    "then , in the case of eqs .",

    "that means , each of the original states has `` lost '' its partner , also in this case ; and the reproduction of the two originally neighbored states is prevented . as a result ,",
    "the interaction of the states of the system via the environment is reduced ( since all states are distant in energy ) , with the consequence that the system can be described well as a closed ( almost stable ) system . in difference to the case with width bifurcation , however , the number of states of the system as a whole remains unchanged .    eqs .",
    "( [ int6b ] ) to ( [ int6 g ] ) with purely imaginary and real coupling strength @xmath89 , respectively , will seldom be realized .",

    "the wavefunctions are strongly mixed and @xmath122 varies suddenly from the value 0 at the ep , according to ( [ eif5 ] ) , to the value almost 1 , characteristic for almost orthogonal states at maximum width bifurcation and level repulsion , respectively .",

    "they hold true for systems with loss ( corresponding to decaying systems ) and also for those in which gain may occur ( by absorbing particles from the environment ) .",
    "they hold true also when gain and loss are balanced .",
    "it should be underlined here once more that a quantum system is really open and its properties are strongly influenced by the environment of scattering wavefunctions _ only _ in the vicinity of eps . here",
    ", neighboring states may strongly interact via the environment and may cause some decoupling of the whole system from the environment , as shown above . as a result of this decoupling ,",

    "nevertheless , such a calculation for an open quantum system remains an approximation , although it will provide good results .",
    "moreover , the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] left panel are unrealistic for a physical system .",

    "the eigenvalues obtained in a corresponding calculation are no longer real in a certain finite parameter range , see the example fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] right panel . also in this case ,",
    "pt symmetry breaking may appear and the behavior of the system at maximum width bifurcation is determined by the nonlinear source term involved in the schrdinger equation for an open quantum system ; and we have the jump - like transition @xmath161 at maximum width bifurcation also in this less symmetric case .",
    "the phenomenon of almost orthogonal wavefunctions at maximum width bifurcation ( or maximum level repulsion ) is robust as figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] to [ fig4 ] for different two - state systems show .",
    "it is _ not _ an artifact of the two - state model ( [ form1 ] ) since it appears also in calculations with more than two states ( see sect .",
    "[ num3 ] ) .",
    "all our calculations with @xmath138 states are performed in the parameter region in which a higher - order ep is expected .",
    "signatures of the existence of such a higher - order ep are not found in any of the results .",
    "this is , of course , not astonishing since every ep is a point in the continuum and therefore of measure zero .",
    "also the second - order eps ( crossing points of two eigenvalue trajectories ) can be identified _ only _ by their influence onto observables in their neighborhood .",
    "our results show clearly that this holds true _ also _ for higher - order eps .",
    "one of the characteristic features of an ep ( i.e. of the crossing point of two eigenvalue trajectories ) is that the two eigenfunctions in its surrounding are mixed due to the coupling of the system to a common environment @xcite .",
    "this environmentally - induced interaction of the states is large at and near to an ep ( where the phase rigidity of the wavefunctions is reduced , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ eigen ] ) .",
    "a nearby state does therefore not interact with the original states which cross at the ep .",
    "it interacts rather with some states , the wavefunctions of which are mixed in those of the original states ( according to ( [ int20 ] ) ) . at and near to these crossing points , new eps of",
    "second order appear , the ranges of influence of which overlap .",
    "in other words , a clustering of eps occurs , see the discussion in section [ adj ] .",
    "it is this phenomenon of clustering of eps which we see in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] to [ fig7 ] .",
    "it occurs in the parameter range of a higher - order ep .",
    "the results are generic and provide us valuable information on the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "most interesting is the phenomenon of the jump - like enhancement of the phase rigidity when the maximum width bifurcation is parametrically approached .",
    "this effect is of the same type as that observed numerically for two states and discussed in detail in sects .",
    "[ num2 ] and [ disc2 ] , respectively .",
    "in this paper we have described open quantum systems by means of a schrdinger equation the hamiltonian @xmath0 of which is completely non - hermitian .",
    "it contains explicitly ( in the non - diagonal matrix elements ) the interaction of the states via the environment .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are complex and the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal .",
    "most interesting property is that the eigenvalues of two states may coalesce in one point ( the so - called ep ) , at which also the corresponding eigenfunctions are the same , up to a phase @xcite .",
    "the eps are singular points and play an important role for the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "we used also the equivalent description of the system by means of a schrdinger equation with the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath162 ( with vanishing non - diagonal matrix elements ) and source term . here ,",
    "the interaction of the states via the environment is contained in the source term , and not in the hamiltonian .",
    "the source term is nonlinear near and at eps .",
    "it drives the behavior of the open quantum system and determines the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "our main concern of the present paper is the phase rigidity @xmath120 of the eigenfunction @xmath38 of @xmath0 .",
    "this value provides a quantitative measure for the biorthogonality of the wavefunction of the state @xmath24 , i.e. for the possibility to influence the properties of the system by the environment .",
    "it holds @xmath163 . at @xmath164 ,",
    "the wavefunctions are almost orthogonal , very much like the eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator . for vanishing @xmath120 however ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian operator are really biorthogonal , and the influence of the environment is extremely large .",
    "this influence may cause , among others , a mixing of the wavefunctions of the different states via the environment . in @xcite , the modification of the eigenfunction @xmath38 of the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath0 due to its coupling to other states of the system via the environment",
    "is studied in detail .",
    "the resulting mixing of the wavefunctions can be expressed by the relation ( [ int20 ] ) . at and near to an ep ,",
    "the mixing is extremely large .",
    "we studied first the phase rigidity in a two - level system around an ep . in all our calculations ,",
    "the coupling strength @xmath89 between system and environment is fixed .",
    "only the energies @xmath8 or widths @xmath9 of the states are parametrically varied .",
    "we have @xmath165 far from an ep and @xmath166 in approaching an ep .",
    "this result is expected from analytical studies .",
    "we observe however also another result in the critical region around an ep which is completely unexpected . in approaching the maximum width bifurcation and level repulsion , respectively",
    ", the value of the phase rigidity varies rapidly from its value @xmath154 to @xmath164 .",
    "that means , that the two wavefunctions are almost orthogonal when the width bifurcation or level repulsion is maximum .",
    "this jump - like variation of the phase rigidity is observed at fixed coupling strength between system and environment .",
    "it is caused therefore exclusively by the nonlinear source term of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the wavefunctions of the states remain mixed at this critical parameter value , although they are almost orthogonal according to @xmath161 .",
    "this phenomenon occurs not only in the simple two - state model ( see sect . [ num2 ] ) but also in the case with more than two states ( see sect . [ num3 ] ) . in the first case ,",
    "we have well separated eps while there is some clustering of eps in the second case .",
    "that means , the clustering of eps does not destroy the effect , see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] to [ fig7 ] .",
    "quite the contrary , the clustering of many eps causes a dynamical phase transition from an open quantum system ( with biorthogonal eigenfunctions of its states ) to an almost closed system ( with almost orthogonal eigenfunctions of its states ) .",
    "the underlying process is irreversible and causes a stabilization of the whole system , meaning that the open system can be described approximately as a closed system .",
    "the wavefunctions at both sides of the dynamical phase transition are non - analytically related to one another and differ fundamentally from one another .",
    "this feature is characteristic of any phase transition .",
    "the wavefunctions of the states on one side of the phase transition might be obtained by using the two - body residual forces derived from forces between free particles .",
    "this will be impossible , however , on the other side of the transition where the wavefunctions are modified due to the mixing of the different states of the system via the common environment .",
    "our results provide the following generic feature of open quantum systems .",
    "when two states are near to one another in energy or in lifetime , they may strongly interact with one another via the continuum of scattering wavefunctions due to the existence of a singular point ( ep ) in their vicinity . here",
    ", the schrdinger equation contains non - linear terms ; irreversible processes occur ; and the whole system will be stabilized . as a result , the system behaves very much like a closed system that is localized in space : the eigenstates are almost orthogonal and the eigenvalues are almost real ( and sometimes even completely real @xcite ) .",
    "such a situation can be described well by a hermitian operator where the lifetime of a state does not appear explicitly . by this , the meaning of lifetime for the characterization of the individual states of the system is lost .",
    "characteristic of the states are solely their energies and wavefunctions , while the lifetimes can be obtained by using perturbation methods .    nevertheless , the results presented in our paper show that energy and time are related to one another in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "it is shown in [ 15 ] that time is bounded from below in non - hermitian quantum physics .",
    "this follows from the fact that the decay widths ( inverse proportional to the lifetimes of the states ) can not increase limitless .",
    "thus , time is bounded from below in the same manner as energy , in contrast to the assumptions of hermitian quantum physics .",
    "pauli has used this argument of hermitian quantum physics , see e.g. [ 23 ] , in order to conclude that the uncertainty relation between time and energy can , on principle , not be derived , for details see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty relation between energy and time remained therefore a puzzling phenomenon in hermitian quantum physics .",
    "as our results show , this phenomenon is _ not at all _ puzzling in non - hermitian quantum physics .",
    "concluding , we recall the phenomenon of resonance trapping @xcite observed many years ago .",
    "resonance trapping occurring in an open quantum system coupled strongly to the environment , prevents the overlapping of individual resonance states .",
    "consequently , the system is practically always in the regime of weakly ( or not ) overlapping resonances , see e.g. @xcite . in analogy to this phenomenon , an open quantum system can be described quite well by a hermitian hamiltonian on both sides of the dynamical phase transition .",
    "this statement agrees completely with experience .",
    "interesting non - trivial features of open quantum systems appear only in the parameter range in which a clustering of eps and therewith a dynamical phase transition occurs .",
    "one of many examples is the relation between reduced phase rigidity and enhanced transmission through a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper are generic .",
