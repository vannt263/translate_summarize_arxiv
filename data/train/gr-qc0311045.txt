    "nonlinear generalization of classical field theory remains one of the possible ways to overcome the difficulties of the theory which considers elementary particles as mathematical points .",
    "the gravitational field equation is nonlinear by nature and the field itself is universal and unscreenable .",
    "these properties lead to definite physical interest for the proper gravitational field to be considered .",
    "nonlinear self - couplings of the spinor fields may arise as a consequence of the geometrical structure of the space - time and , more precisely , because of the existence of torsion . as early as 1938",
    ", ivanenko @xcite showed that a relativistic theory imposes in some cases a fourth - order self - coupling . in 1950 , weyl  @xcite proved that , if the affine and the metric properties of the space - time are taken as independent , the spinor field obeys either a linear equation in a space with torsion or a nonlinear one in a riemannian space .",
    "as the self - action is of spin - spin type , it allows the assignment of a dynamical role to the spin and offers a clue about the origin of the nonlinearities . a nonlinear spinor field ,",
    "suggested by the symmetric coupling between nucleons , muons , and leptons , has been investigated by finkelstein et .",
    "@xcite in the classical approximation .",
    "although the existence of spin-@xmath7 fermion is both theoretically and experimentally undisputed , these are described by _",
    "quantum _ spinor fields .",
    "possible justifications for the existence of classical spinors has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "the present cosmology is based largely on friedmann solutions of the einstein equations , which describe the completely uniform and isotropic universe ( `` closed '' and `` open '' models ) the main feature of these solutions is their non - stationarity .",
    "the idea of an expanding universe , following from this property , is confirmed by the astronomical observations and it is now safe to assume that the isotropic model provides , in its general features , an adequate description of the present state of the universe .",
    "although the universe seems homogeneous and isotropic at present , the large scale matter distribution in the observable universe , largely manifested in the form of discrete structures , does not exhibit homogeneity of a higher order .",
    "recent space investigations detect anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "in fact , the theoretical arguments  @xcite and recent experimental data that support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one leads to consider the models of universe with anisotropic back - ground .",
    "zeldovich was first to assume that the early isotropization of cosmological expanding process can take place as a result of quantum effect of particle creation near singularity  @xcite .",
    "this assumption was further justified by several authors  @xcite .    a bianchi type - i ( bi ) universe , being the straightforward generalization of the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , is of particular interest because it is one of the simplest models of an anisotropic universe that describes a homogeneous and spatially flat universe .",
    "unlike the frw universe which has the same scale factor for each of the three spatial directions , a bi universe has a different scale factor in each direction , thereby introducing an anisotropy to the system .",
    "it moreover has the agreeable property that near the singularity it behaves like a kasner universe , even in the presence of matter , and consequently falls within the general analysis of the singularity given by belinskii et al  @xcite .",
    "also in a universe filled with matter for @xmath8 , it has been shown that any initial anisotropy in a bi universe quickly dies away and a bi universe eventually evolves into a frw universe  @xcite .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , this feature of the bi universe makes it a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations .",
    "it should be noted an important property of the isotropic model is the presence of a singular point to time in its space - time metric which means that the time is restricted .",
    "is the presence of a singular point an inherent property of the relativistic cosmological models or it is only a consequence of specific simplifying assumptions underlying these models ?",
    "motivated to answer this question self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor and bi gravitational fields were studied in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that a spinor field in a bi universe was also studied by belinskii and khalatnikov @xcite .",
    "using hamiltonian techniques , henneaux studied class - a bianchi universes generated by a spinor source @xcite .",
    "in this report we consider a self - consistent system of spinor , scalar and bianchi type - i gravitation fields in presence of perfect fluid and cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted that the inclusion of the @xmath6 adds new dimension in the evolution of the universe .",
    "assuming that the @xmath6 term may be both possitive and negative , it opens a much wider field of possibiliteis in the search for a singularity - free solutions to the field equations .",
    "apart from the papers written on this subject by us earlier , in this one beside the power type interaction term we consider a trigonometric one as well .",
    "in addition to asymptotic analysis , numerical analysis of the corresponding nonlinear differential equations has been performed to some extent as well .",
    "in this section we derive the fundamental equations for the interacting spinor , scalar and gravitational fields from the action and write their solutions in term of the voulume scale @xmath9 defined bellow .",

    "@xmath227 at this point is reasonably small , whereas for a relatively large @xmath235 we have a situation when @xmath229 dominates @xmath227 . relative behavior of @xmath227 and @xmath229 has been shown in fig .  [ en_mom1 ] .",
    "thus we conclude that in case of interacting spinor and scalar fields it is possible to construct regular solutions without violating dominant energy condition of hawking - penrose theorem .    1 cm",

    "a perspective view of the potential @xmath211 is given in the figs .",
    "[ c01 ] and [ c01a ] . here",
    "we choose the problem parameters as follows : @xmath241 , spinor mass @xmath206 , coupling constant @xmath242 , cosmological constant @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 .    1",
    "cm    it is clear from fig .",
    "[ c01 ] that an oscillatory mode of evolution takes place , as was expected for a positive @xmath6 .",
    "let us now study the system for a negative @xmath6 .",
    "contrary to the case with @xmath196 , where all the solutions for a negative @xmath6 grow exponentially , in the case considered here an interesting situation occurs for some special choice of parameters .    1 cm    as one sees from fig .",
    "[ bulbous ] , depending on the integration constant and initial value of @xmath9 , the mode of evolution can be both finite and exponential . for the integration constant being at the level @xmath246 in fig .",

    "[ tau6 ] corresponding to @xmath249 , whereas , for @xmath250 we have @xmath9 that is expanding exponentially . in case of @xmath145 being at the same level with point @xmath251 we have the similar picture of evolution , but",
    "in this case once @xmath9 reaches point @xmath252 , the process of evolution would come to a halt .",
    "thus we conclude that for a trigonometric interaction term the system even with a negative @xmath6 admits non - exponential mode of evolution .    to investigate the dominant energy condition let us write the components of energy - momentum tensor . for simplicity we set @xmath197 and",
    "in term of @xmath4 for energy density we write @xmath253 since @xmath9 is a positive quantity , @xmath4 is positive as well . as one sees from for any positive value of @xmath4 and @xmath254 energy density",

    "since @xmath256 , it means that @xmath227 has its maximum as @xmath225 and tends to zero as @xmath257 .    on the for the pressure components we have @xmath258",
    "as one sees , for a @xmath254 @xmath229 may both positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath259 . moreover , its maximum value is proportional to @xmath260 .",

    "therefore we conclude that the regular solutions obtained in this case results in broken dominant energy condition .    1 cm",
    "within the framework of the simplest model of interacting spinor and scalar fields it is shown that the @xmath6 term plays very important role in bi cosmology . in particular",
    ", it invokes oscillations in the model which is not the case when @xmath6 term remains absent . for a non - positive @xmath6",
    "we find an universe expanding exponentially , hence the initial anisotropy of the model quickly dies away , whereas for a positive @xmath6 with the corresponding choice of integration constant @xmath265 one finds the oscillatory mode of expansion of the universe . in this case",
    "it is possible to construct solutions those are always regular . it should be emphasized that if the spinor field nonlinearity is generated by self - action the regularity of the solutions obtained results in the violation of the dominant energy condition of penrose - hawking theorem @xcite , whereas in the case considered here , when the spinor field nonlinearity is induced by the scalar one , regular solutions can be obtained even without breaking the aforementioned condition .",
