    "over the past two decades , astronomers have identified a few hundred young ( ages @xmath10 to @xmath7100 myr ) stars , including more than a half - dozen t tauri and post - t tauri associations , within @xmath7100 pc of earth .",
    "most such stars have been identified on the basis of their characteristically large x - ray fluxes , thermal infrared emission from warm circumstellar dust , optical spectral features ( principally , strong li absorption lines ) , and/or distinctive space velocities .",
    "based on the low frequency of mid- to far - infrared excesses among the nearby , young stellar groups , only a small percentage of such stars evidently retain massive , dusty , circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast to the large disk fractions of pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) star populations associated with molecular clouds .",
    "this contrast reflects the relatively advanced ages of the known young stars within @xmath11 pc and suggests that , while many may still be building terrestrial planets @xcite , most have already moved beyond the epoch of active giant planet formation .",
    "examples of _ actively accreting _ , low - mass pre - ms stars ( i.e. , classical t tauri stars ; ctts ) within @xmath7100 pc are rarer still @xcite . the archetype of these nearby ctts systems  which are characterized by their unusually large h@xmath12 emission equivalent widths  is the intensively studied tw hya . at a distance of 56 pc ,",
    "tw hya is among the closest known ctts pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and twa 30ab ( @xmath13 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are the closest known examples of actively accreting , low - mass stars . ] . with an estimated age of @xmath14 myr , tw hya also remains one of the oldest known examples of a ctts . in the latter regard , however , it is rivaled by two other , nearby systems : the close binary ctts v4046 sgr and the ctts mp mus .",
    "estimates of the age and distance of the latter star range , respectively , from 6 myr to 17 myr and from 86 pc to 103 pc @xcite .",
    "the younger age ( hence larger distance ) appears more accurate , given the li absorption line strength of mp mus @xcite and its likely association with the @xmath15 cha group @xcite .",
    "high - resolution ( gratings ) x - ray spectra of tw hya , v4046 sgr , and mp mus reveal evidence for a significant emission contribution from accretion shocks , as opposed to coronal activity .",
    "this is consistent with observations demonstrating that the h@xmath12 and uv emission from each of these three stars is stronger than that typically associated with pure chromospheric activity @xcite .",
    "radio molecular line emission studies of circumstellar planet - forming disks provide unique insight into the jovian planet , kuiper belt , and comet formation zones within the outer regions ( tens to hundreds of au in radius ) of pre - ms circumstellar disks .",
    "thus far , however , only four star - disk systems within @xmath11 pc of earth have been detected in molecular emission lines with a radio telescope : the aforementioned @xmath16 myr - old , k - type ctts systems tw hya @xcite and v4046 sgr , and the a - type stars 49 cet and hd 141569 ( ages @xmath17 and @xmath10 myr , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "detections of a suite of molecular transitions toward tw hya established that it possesses a rich molecular disk viewed nearly pole - on , while the double - peaked molecular line profiles characteristic of keplerian rotation observed toward v4046 sgr similarly demonstrated that this close ( period 2.4 d ) binary system is orbited by a circumbinary molecular disk .",
    "these single - dish radio molecular line spectroscopy results have subsequently been confirmed via radio interferometric ( submillimeter array ) imaging of co emission @xcite .    in an effort to similarly characterize the gas mass , dynamics , and chemistry within the disk of mp mus ( spectral type k1",
    "i ve ) , we searched for , and detected , co emission from mp mus with the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) 12 m telescope . in this paper , we report on these results and their interpretation .",
    "we also report the nondetection of co emission from a sample of ten other nearby ( @xmath8 pc ) , dusty , young ( ages @xmath16100 myr ) stars of spectral type a  g with the institut de radio astronomie millimetrique ( iram ) 30 m telescope .",
    "we observed the ten starsco(21 ) spectrum established that bright interstellar emission is present at the radial velocity of the star , precluding any attempt to constrain its circumstellar gas mass via single - dish co measurements . ] in table  [ tbl : nondetections ] in the 230.538 ghz @xmath18 transition of @xmath19co with the iram 30 m telescope in august 2009 .",
    "these stars ( table  [ tbl : nondetections ] ) were chosen from the list of @xcite on the basis of large infrared excesses ( indicative of disk dust masses @xmath20 ) and estimated ages @xmath21 100 myr .",
    "we observed all target stars using iram s emir receivers and vespa autocorrelator , with velocity resolution of 0.8 km s@xmath22 .",
    "spectra were acquired in wobbler switching mode , resulting in flat baselines for individual spectra .",
    "total on - source integration times were between 1 and 2 hours per star .",
    "the weather was generally good ( @xmath23 0.250.4 ) throughout the observations , with time - averaged system temperatures in the range 220510 k. pointing and focus were checked ( against standard pointing sources and planets ) every @xmath72 hours .",
    "typical pointing errors were @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath71/4 beamwidth ( fwhp @xmath25 at 230 ghz ) .",
    "we used the class radio spectral line data reduction package to sum over individual spectral scans obtained for each star , and then to subtract a linear - fit baseline from each of the resulting integrated spectra , calculating channel - to - channel noise levels in the process .",
    "no co emission lines were evident in any of the resulting spectra obtained for the ten sample stars .",
    "upper limits on main - beam brightness temperature @xmath26 ( assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28 for measurements at 230 ghz with the iram 30 m telescope ) and velocity - integrated co line intensity @xmath29 are reported in table  [ tbl : nondetections ] as the values @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath32 is the efficiency - corrected rms channel - to - channel noise in the co spectrum and @xmath33 , with velocity resolution @xmath34 km s@xmath22 and an assumed linewidth @xmath35 km s@xmath22 .",
    "service - mode apex 12 m telescope observations of mp mus ( j2000 coordinates @xmath3613:22:07.55 , @xmath37@xmath3869:38:12.2 ) in the 345.796 ghz @xmath39 transition of @xmath19co were performed on 15 and 16 april 2010 ut . the receiver was shfi / apex2 , using the facility ffts backend with velocity resolution 0.21 km s@xmath22 .",
    "spectra were acquired in position switching mode using the wobbler .",
    "total on - source integration time was 138 min .",
    "the weather was generally good throughout the observations ( @xmath40 0.2 ; pwv 1.8 mm ; time - averaged system temperature @xmath41 k ) .",
    "the best focus was established at the beginning of each day s observations , and regular pointing checks ( using nearby planets and quasars as references ) indicated pointing errors were @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 beamwidth ( fwhp @xmath44 at 345 ghz ) .",
    "apex spectra of mp mus were reduced using class , as described in  2.1 .    the resulting , integrated , baseline- and beam - efficiency - corrected spectrum ( assuming @xmath45 for measurements at 345 ghz with the apex 12 m telescope ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : co32profcomp ] .",
    "this spectrum clearly reveals the detection of @xmath19co(32 ) emission from mp mus . from a gaussian fit to the line profile , we find the central velocity to be @xmath46 km s@xmath22 with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "this translates to a heliocentric velocity of @xmath47 km s@xmath22 , which is consistent with the systemic velocity of mp mus as determined from optical spectroscopy .",
    "the integrated line intensity obtained from the best - fit gaussian is @xmath48 k km s@xmath22 .",
    "given the signal - to - noise ratio of the co(32 ) data obtained for mp mus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co32profcomp ] ) , we can not unambiguously determine the underlying emission line profile .",
    "however , the steep sides and possible central valley ( i.e. , double - peaked appearance ) of the mp mus co emission line are features expected in the case of an orbiting molecular disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we fit the profile with a parametric representation of the line profile predicted by the keplerian disk model of @xcite as described in .",
    "provided the observed line profile is well fit , this method yields an estimate of outer disk rotation velocity @xmath49  where @xmath49 is equivalent to the half - value of the velocity separation of the red and blue peaks in the double - peaked line profile predicted for keplerian rotation  as well as measures of the slopes of the inner and outer portions of the line profiles ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ) .",
    "the value of @xmath51 serves as an indication of the slope of the disk radial temperature profile ( @xmath52 ) , while @xmath50 indicates the degree of central filling of the line profile by emission from gas at low radial velocities ( e.g. , for a nearly edge - on disk , @xmath53 would correspond to a sharp outer edge and values @xmath54 would indicate lack of a sharp edge ) .",
    "the observed line profile is overlaid with the best - fit model profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : co32profcomp ] .",
    "the comparison confirms that the co line emission profile of mp mus is consistent with that of a molecular disk in keplerian rotation .",
    "the best - fit keplerian model parameter values ( and formal uncertainties on these values ) are @xmath55 km s@xmath22 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath51 is compatible with standard models of keplerian disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given an estimate for the mass of mp mus , @xmath58 , the best - fit value of @xmath49 can be used to place constraints on the molecular disk outer cutoff radius @xmath59 for an assumed disk inclination @xmath60 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . adopting @xmath61 @xmath4 ( based on comparison with pre - ms evolutionary tracks ;",
    "* ) and @xmath62 ( based on the morphology of the disk as detected in coronagraphic imaging of starlight reflected off of dust ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the result @xmath63 km s@xmath22 implies @xmath64 au .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the outer disk radius inferred ( also on the basis of coronagraphic imaging ) by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath65 au , assuming a distance to mp mus of 86 pc .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in our line profile analysis as well as in the mass , age , and distance of mp mus (  4 )  and the possibility that the ( 32 ) transition of co is not well excited within the outermost regions of the disk  it appears our estimate of the radius of the molecular disk is in reasonable agreement with the dust disk radius as measured coronagraphically .    the best - fit keplerian model @xmath19co(32 ) line profile area is slightly larger than that obtained from the gaussian fit (  2.1 ) , i.e. , @xmath66 k km s@xmath22 .",
    "this is a factor @xmath1 weaker than the integrated @xmath19co(32 ) line intensity of tw hya as measured with the jcmt @xcite , suggesting that the intrinsic total @xmath19co(32 ) line intensity of mp mus is a factor @xmath67 smaller than that of tw hya , after accounting for the difference in jcmt and apex beam sizes and assuming mp mus lies at @xmath68 pc (  4 ) .",
    "the measured total apex @xmath19co(32 ) line intensity of mp mus is equivalent to an integrated line flux of @xmath69 jy km s@xmath22 .",
    "this result can be used to estimate the molecular gas mass of the mp mus disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein )  albeit with large uncertainties , especially given that thus far we have no measurements of other co isotopes and ( hence ) no means to estimate the @xmath19co(32 ) line optical depth ( @xmath70 ) other than the foregoing rough comparison with tw hya . adopting the standard assumptions of a co : h@xmath71 number ratio of @xmath72 and molecular gas excitation temperature @xmath73 k , and assuming @xmath74 we obtain a molecular ( h@xmath71 ) gas mass of @xmath75 @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) .",
    "this inferred disk gas mass , which scales approximately linearly with @xmath70 if the @xmath19co(32 ) is optically thick , is somewhat less than the circumstellar dust mass of 17 @xmath76 determined for mp mus by @xcite on the basis of the star s 1.2 mm flux .",
    "we used the same method just described for mp mus to estimate molecular gas mass upper limits for the dusty disks of the ten stars observed with , but not detected by , the iram 30 m. the results , obtained under the assumptions co : h@xmath71 @xmath77 , @xmath73 k , and @xmath78 , are reported in table  [ tbl : nondetections ] .",
    "these upper limits are of course subject to the same uncertainties just described in the case of mp mus .",
    "nevertheless , the results in table  [ tbl : nondetections ] indicate that , for these ten stars , the disk gas masses are constrained to be of order of ( or smaller than ) a few times the dust masses inferred from far - ir ( iras ) data , provided the co emission is not optically thick or that gas - phase co in these disks is not severely depleted relative to h@xmath71 .",
    "with our co detection of a disk orbiting mp mus , this star joins @xmath78 myr - old tw hya and @xmath79 myr - old v4046 sgr as the only late - type ( therefore low - mass ) pre - ms stars within @xmath11 pc of earth that are known to retain orbiting molecular disks . in all three cases , the circumstellar gas masses inferred from far - ir and radio emission lines",
    " a few to a few hundred @xmath76  are similar to the dust masses determined from far - ir and ( sub)mm photometry .",
    "this implies dust - to - gas ratios near unity in the outer ( @xmath80 au ) regions of these disks and/or , in the case of gas mass estimates based on radio co lines , that gas - phase co is severely depleted relative to h@xmath71 .",
    "the overall similarity of mp mus to the tw hya and v4046 sgr star - disk systems favors the younger end of the range of ages estimated to date for mp mus .",
    "this is consistent with the recent results of @xcite , who estimated an age of @xmath81 myr based on the li absorption line strength of mp mus .",
    "an age of @xmath1 myr would , in turn , imply the distance to mp mus is @xmath11 pc @xcite .",
    "for such a distance , the mass of mp mus could be @xmath17% larger than previously determined ( i.e. , closer to 1.4 @xmath4 ) , depending on the adopted theoretical pre - ms evolutionary tracks ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "if so , the co and dust disk radii would be correspondingly larger than the estimates stated in  3.1 .    given the relatively advanced pre - ms evolutionary states of tw hya , v4046 sgr , and mp mus , their circumstellar environments likely are in transition from predominantly primordial material to `` debris '' disks that are populated by dust grains generated via collisions between rapidly growing planetesimals ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the stars for which we failed to detect molecular gas ( table  [ tbl : nondetections ] ) likely fall into this latter category ; all of the table  [ tbl : nondetections ] stars have disk dust masses much smaller than those of tw hya , v4046 sgr , and mp mus , and all have ages @xmath8210 myr .",
    "the comparison of the residual gas masses of the three nearby ctts with the gas mass upper limits in table  [ tbl : nondetections ] thereby further reinforces the notion that the gaseous disks required to spawn jovian planets dissipate rapidly , i.e. , within the first few myr of pre - ms evolution @xcite .",
    "`` transition disks '' usually display evidence for inner ( radii @xmath7 a few au ) disk clearings that may be the results of recent or ongoing planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this respect ,",
    "mp mus , tw hya , and v4046 sgr are typical of transition disk systems ; all three lack the significant near - ir excesses , indicative of hot dust in inner disks , that are characteristic of rapidly accreting ctts in molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the same time , like certain ctts in taurus that display transition disks ( dm aur and gm aur ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all three nearby , late - type stars with detectable circumstellar co emission also display spectral evidence for ongoing accretion  evidence that ( to our knowledge ) is lacking in the cases of the table  [ tbl : nondetections ] stars .",
    "the fact that tw hya , v4046 sgr and mp mus are evidently still accreting from their `` transition disks '' may indicate that they are orbited by young planets ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "regardless , the detections of co in the dusty disks of mp mus , tw hya and v4046 sgr suggest that the presence of residual disk molecular gas is closely linked to ( likely enables ) sustained accretion activity at advanced pre - ms ages .",
