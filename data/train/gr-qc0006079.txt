    "to detect gravitational waves in the frequency band between @xmath8 and @xmath9hz , the tama300 has been constructed @xcite and tama300 team has already carried out several data taking runs @xcite .",
    "other kilometer - size interferometric detectors such as ligo , virgo and geo600 are also now under construction and will be in operation within a couple of years @xcite .",
    "in addition , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is now planned to be constructed in the next decade @xcite to detect gravitational waves in the frequency band between @xmath10 and @xmath11hz . main purposes of these projects are ( i ) the detection of gravitational waves and ( ii ) the observation of relativistic astrophysical phenomena in a strong gravitational field . the purpose ( i )",
    "is related to a fundamental question on the correctness of general relativity because the detection of gravitational waves could give a strong constraint about number of modes and propagation speed of gravitational waves @xcite .    as an alternative candidate of general relativity ,",
    "the scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite has recently received a renewed interest .",
    "one of the reasons for its revival is that a theoretical approach to unification of interactions in terms of superstring theories suggests that the theory of gravity should be the dilatonic one ( a kind of the scalar - tensor theory ) rather than general relativity , _ i.e. _ , the pure tensor theory @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "shibata , nakao and nakamura investigated the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust ball to be a black hole in the framework of the brans - dicke theory ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they found that the amplitude of scalar gravitational waves can be @xmath12 or equivalently @xmath13 with the frequency @xmath14hz which is in an appropriate frequency range for kilometer - size detectors and lisa , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the mass of the collapsed object , solar mass , distance from the source to the detectors , and the so - called brans - dicke parameter , respectively .",
    "the noise level of the advanced kilometer - size detectors and lisa will be @xmath19 for the most sensitive frequency band .",
    "thus , although the present experimental limit is stringent @xmath20 @xcite , the amplitude of scalar gravitational waves may be high enough to be detected by the interferometric detectors if stellar mass black holes are formed in our galaxy or if supermassive black holes are formed in the cosmological scale .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite and reanalyzed by maggiore and nicolis @xcite , the antenna sensitivity pattern of interferometric detectors to the scalar mode is different form that of the tensor mode .",
    "this implies that if four interferometric detectors which are coincidently in operation detects gravitational waves , it is possible to ask whether the scalar mode exists or not using the difference of the arrival time and the difference of the antenna pattern among four detectors @xcite .",
    "also , the peak frequency of the scalar mode is likely different from that of the tensor mode @xcite , suggesting that the two modes could be distinguished in the frequency domain even in the case of one interferometer .",
    "thus , for exploration of the correctness of general relativity using interferometric detectors , it is important to clarify the antenna sensitivity pattern and frequency response function not only for the tensor mode but for the scalar mode of gravitational waves . from this motivation ,",
    "analyses have been carried out in @xcite@xcite so far , but they were too crude @xcite or approximate @xcite . in this article , we carry out a rigorous reanalysis of the frequency response function and antenna sensitivity pattern of the interferometric detector to the scalar mode without any approximation : we directly solve the maxwell equation for the propagation of a laser ray and the geodesic equation for motion of mirrors and a beam splitter in contrast to a previous work @xcite .",
    "our straightforward treatment enables us to investigate the dependence of the antenna sensitivity pattern on the wave length of the scalar mode of gravitational waves without any ambiguity .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the linearized equation for gravitational waves in the framework of the scalar - tensor theory of gravity . in sec .",
    "iii , we solve the maxwell field equation in the spacetime with the scalar mode of gravitational waves to derive a plane wave solution which describes the path of a laser ray in the interferometric detector . in sec .",
    "iv , we present explicit solutions for timelike geodesics in the presence of scalar gravitational waves , since the mirrors and beam splitter in the interferometric detector move along timelike geodesics .",
    "we present the dependence of the frequency response function and antenna sensitivity pattern of michelson interferometric detectors on the frequency of the scalar mode of gravitational waves in sec .",

    "note that measurement of a gravitational lensing angle of a light ray from a distant quasar by the gravity of the sun now constrains @xmath34 to be @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "since the interferometric detectors are located in the wave zone of gravitational waves , we need to consider the linearized , vacuum @xmath36 field equations .",
    "we write the metric tensor and gravitational scalar field in the forms @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the metric tensor of the background minkowski spacetime and @xmath39 is the value of @xmath29 in the infinity .",
    "we assume that magnitude of each component of the perturbations @xmath40 and @xmath41 is much smaller than unity .",

    "in the rest of this article , we assume that the amplitude of the tensor mode @xmath52 is much smaller than that of sgw for simplicity .",

    "( [ eq : cf - maxwell - eq ] ) is of the same form as the equation in the minkowski spacetime .    in the geometrical approximation ,",

( [ eq : cf - maxwell - eq ] ) implies that even in the presence of sgw , the components of the vector potential @xmath65 is completely the same as in eq .

    ", one might think that the laser interferometric detector could not detect sgw since sgw do not affect the maxwell field described in the conformally flat coordinate system .",
    "however this is the misunderstanding .",
    "we should take into account that the laser ray is repeatedly reflected by mirrors which are perturbed in the presence of sgw .",

    "however , from careful investigation of the geodesic deviation equation , we find that the tidal force associated with sgw acts along the directions orthogonal to the propagation direction of sgw @xcite . from this point of view , sgw should be regarded as the transverse wave .",
    "it is also worthy to note that even if free masses are at rest in the present coordinate , the relative distances between them are not necessarily constant if sgw exist .",

    "the amplitude @xmath130 of the laser ray entering into arm2 is written in the form @xmath230 where we assume that the ray reaches the beam splitter on the side of the output port at @xmath98 , and @xmath231    we assume that the following resonance condition holds in the absence of sgw , @xmath232 where @xmath233 is integer . since the output port should be dark in the absence of sgw , @xmath234 and @xmath235 should satisfy @xmath236 where @xmath139 is integer .",
    "hence the output in the presence of sgw is given by @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the frequency response function of the fp interferometric detector to sgw .",
    "for simplicity , we focus on the case @xmath239 then the response function @xmath238 is written as @xmath240,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath241    due to the same reason as in the case of dl interferometric detectors , we assume that @xmath242 is much smaller than @xmath154 . then for @xmath243 , the frequency response function @xmath238 is derived as @xmath244 thus , fp interferometric detectors also have the same angular dependence of the frequency response function as michelson detectors of the arm length @xmath154 . in the limit @xmath245 ,",
    "the response function @xmath238 becomes @xmath246 in the case of finite @xmath18 , the absolute value of the response function @xmath247 for @xmath149 and @xmath150 becomes @xmath248 we show @xmath249 for various @xmath204 in fig .",
    "[ fg : fp - response ] .",
    "note that @xmath249 depends on the value of the reflection coefficient @xmath204 of the front mirror sensitively .",
    "for example , in the case of tama300 , @xmath204 is equal to @xmath250 .",
    "the interferometric detector such large @xmath204 is sensitive for @xmath251 for which the wave length is much longer than that of the arm length of the interferometer .",
    "hence the antenna sensitivity pattern of such a fp interferometric detector is almost the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp - limit - value ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with maggiore and nicolis @xcite .",
    "we have rigorously analyzed the sensitivity of interferometric detectors to sgw .",
    "since we calculate the side - band waves of laser rays directly solving the maxwell field equation , we were able to obtain the dependence of the antenna sensitivity pattern on the frequency of sgw without any ambiguity .",
    "as a result , we found that the antenna sensitivity pattern of the simple michelson interferometric detector depends strongly on the frequency of sgw .",
    "these features are essentially the same as in the case of tensor mode of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "lisa is the interferometric detector and will be simply michelson .",
    "thus , the dependence of the antenna sensitivity pattern on the wave length of sgw has to be taken into account as in the case of the tensor modes .",
    "we have also found that the dependence of the antenna sensitivity patterns of both the delay - line and fabry - perot interferometers on the frequency of sgw is proportional to that of the simple michelson one .",
    "this implies that if the wave length of sgw is comparable to the arm length of the interferometric detector , the antenna sensitivity patterns of delay - line- and fabry - perot interferometric detectors are different from the result obtained by maggiore and nicolis who assumed that the amplitude of sgw is constant in their calculation .",
    "however , the effective optical path length of delay - line- and fabry - perot detectors will be optimized for sgw of the wave length much longer than the arm length . in this case , the wave length of sgw is much longer than the arm length of the interferometric detector and the amplitude of sgw can be considered to be effectively constant for evaluating the response , even if the wave length of sgw is comparable to the optical length . therefore , the antenna sensitivity pattern is almost same as the results obtained by maggiore and nicolis @xcite .",
