    "the eclipsing binaries as members of more complex multiple systems can provide us important information about their physical properties , as derived from different methods .",
    "this is the case of v2083  cyg , which is the system , where the close components form an eclipsing binary , and the third distant body orbiting the close pair is detected as a visual component .",
    "thanks to the combined analysis we are able to derive the radii , masses and evolutionary status of the close components and also some properties of the distant one .",
    "such systems are still very rare and mostly lie relatively close to the solar system . nowadays ,",
    "there are known only 33 such systems , where a close eclipsing binary is a member of a wide visual binary and we know both orbits , their mutual inclinations , ratio of periods , etc .",
    "such a unique systems are the most suitable ones for studies of dynamical effects , the short and long - term evolution of the orbits , etc .",
    "( see e.g. ) .",
    "the system v2083  cyg (= hd  184242 = hip  96011 , ra 19@xmath0 31@xmath1 16.36@xmath2 de  + 47@xmath3 28@xmath4 52.24@xmath5 , @xmath6  mag ) is an algol - type eclipsing binary with its orbital period about 1.87  day .",
    "it is also a primary component of a visual double star designated as wds j19313 + 4729 in the washington double star catalog ( wds , @xcite ) .",
    "the secondary component of this double star is about 220  mas distant and is a bit fainter . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude difference is not very certain , because different authors list different values .",
    "the wds catalogue itself gives 7.50 and 7.93  mag for both components .",
    "the system is rather neglected one and there are only a few papers published .",
    "it was discovered as an eclipsing binary from the hipparcos data @xcite , which also reveal that the light curve ( hereafter lc ) shows two similar minima and a classical feature of an algol - type star .",
    "spectral type of the system is not known very precisely nowadays .",
    "@xcite presented spectral classification of the whole ab system as am ( k / h / m = a3/a8/a9 ) , gives a composite spectral type as a3-a9 , while the spectral type a3 was presented by @xcite , @xcite , and many others .",
    "this could indicate that the combined spectrum is composed from components of slightly different spectral types .",
    "the photometry of v2083  cyg obtained from the hipparcos mission gives a color index @xmath7  mag ( indicating sp.type a9 , ) , while the infrared @xmath8 and @xmath9 indices , which are less influenced by interstellar reddening , as derived from the 2mass survey give spectral types about a4 and a7 , @xcite .",
    "the visual orbit of the two components was derived by @xcite .",
    "they presented the orbital period of the double about 372  yr , the angular semimajor axis about 498  mas , and the eccentricity 0.16 .",
    "however , as they already mentioned , the orbit is still only a preliminary one .",
    "we started collecting the photometric data of the system in april 2008 . in total",
    "there are 31 nights of observations , but for the light - curve analysis we used only 27 nights of observations obtained from april 2008 to september 2009 and carried out with the same telescope and detector at the private observatory by one of the authors ( ps ) . owing to high brightness of the target , there was used only a small 34-mm refractor at the private observatory in brno , czech republic , using the sbig st-7xme ccd camera and standard @xmath10 filters by the specification by @xcite .",
    "all the measurements were processed by the software c - munipack ] , which is based on aperture photometry and using the standard daophot routines @xcite .",
    "the other nights were used only for deriving the precise times of minima for the system .    besides our new observations , there were also used the photometric data obtained within the superwasp survey @xcite . however , these data are not of enough quality to be used for the lc analysis .",
    "hence , we made use of the swasp photometry only for deriving the minima times of v2083  cyg for a prospective period analysis .",
    "for all of the minima the kwee - van woerden method was used @xcite , and all of them are given in table [ minima ] .",
    "the linear ephemeris are as follows : @xmath11     ( blue ) , @xmath12 ( green ) , and @xmath13 ( red ) filters for v2083  cyg , the solid line represents the final fit ( see the text).,width=302 ]    the ccd spectra were obtained at ondejov observatory , czech republic , using the 2.0-m telescope equipped with a site-005 800 @xmath14 2000 ccd detector .",
    "these spectra cover a wavelength region 626  676 nm .",
    "all of them were secured between april 2010 and may 2011 and have a linear dispersion of about 17  @xmath15/mm .",
    "their s / n values range typically between 100 and 200",
    ".    for all of the spectra used the wavelength calibration was made via a thar comparison spectra obtained before and after the stellar spectra itself .",
    "the flatfields were taken in the beginning and end of the night and their means were used for the reduction .",
    "after then , the radial velocities ( hereafter rv ) were obtained with the program spefo , with using the zero point correction via measuring the telluric lines . in total 19 spectra",
    "were obtained this way . moreover , also two elodie spectra @xcite obtained in 1999 were added for the analysis .",
    "a list of derived radial velocities from all of the available spectral observations is written in table [ rvs ] . in the last column the reference elodie or ondejov",
    "for all of the spectra we also tried to identify the third component lines , however these radial velocities are rather uncertain and affected by relatively large errors ( see below sections [ visual ] and [ physical ] ) .",
    "the complete lc ( in @xmath10 filters ) and rv curves were analyzed simultaneously , using the program phoebe @xcite , which is based on the wilson - devinney algorithm @xcite .",
    "the derived quantities are as follows : the semi - major axis @xmath16 , the mass ratio @xmath17 , the systemic velocity @xmath18 , the secondary temperature @xmath19 , the inclination @xmath20 , the luminosities @xmath21 , the gravity darkening coefficients @xmath22 , the limb darkening coefficients @xmath23 , the albedo coefficients @xmath24 , and the synchronicity parameters @xmath25 .",
    "the limb darkening was approximated via linear cosine law , and the values of @xmath23 were interpolated from van  hamme s tables , see @xcite .",
    "for the whole analysis , we followed this procedure : at the beginning , we fixed the temperature of the primary component at @xmath26  k ( corresponding to spectral type a7 , @xcite ) .",
    "we were trying to find the best lc+rv fit according to the lowest value of rms .",
    "there was a solution reached , but this one was unacceptable due to the fact that resulting values of @xmath27 , and @xmath19 are in contradiction with each other .",
    "in particular , the resulting spectral types as derived from @xmath28 and @xmath29 differ significantly between each other . for this reason",
    ", we tried a different starting value of @xmath30 . with this method we were changing the temperature @xmath30 in the range from 8520  k to 7020  k ( spectral types a3 to f0 ) and trying to find a consistent solution . for all of these attempts , the value of @xmath30 remained fixed .",
    "our final parameters as derived from the lc+rv fit are given in table [ lcrvparam ] .",
    "the plot of the lc is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lc ] , while the rv curves with the fits are given in fig .",
    "[ fig - rv ] .",
    "the value of eccentricity was fixed at 0 . for the discussion about the physical parameters of the components ( eclipsing ones and also the third one ) ,",
    "see section [ physical ] .    for the whole computation process , the values of albedos @xmath24 and the values of gravity",
    "darkening coefficients were set at their appropriate values ( @xmath31 or 0.5 , and @xmath32 or 0.32 ) according to the component s temperatures ( @xmath33  k , or @xmath34  k ) .",
    "another problematic issue were the values of @xmath25 , which tended to decrease down to 0 for both components for each of the @xmath30 values .",
    "these dropped down very quickly after a few steps of iterations .",
    "due to this reason we tried a different approach .",
    "from the spectra of the system we estimated the values @xmath35 , which were used to derive the values of @xmath25 for both components .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath25 as given in table [ lcrvparam ] are not derived from the combined lc&rv analysis but from the spectra .",
    "the fitting process with phoebe was carried out assuming three luminosities . besides the luminosities of primary and secondary component of the eclipsing binary pair also the additional third light @xmath36 was considered .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to the visual component b and is presented in the combined light for all the time ( the two visual components are too close ) . from this value",
    "one can speculate about some physical parameters of the third body in the system , see below section [ physical ] ."
