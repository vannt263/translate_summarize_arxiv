    ", as also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "consistently with these previous studies , we find in the simulation an composed of a slowly rotating core and a rotationally supported massive envelope . as the mixing length increases , the structure of the is altered due to interplay between three competing effects .",
    "first , angular momentum redistribution spins up the core , reducing its compactness .",
    "second , the loss of angular momentum from the massive envelope results in a compression the .",
    "third , as more kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy by turbulent dissipation , the inner core becomes hotter and expands because of the increased pressure .",
    "the interplay between these effects is complicated by the fact that the angular momentum of the is not conserved , but is radiated in at a rate proportional to that of the gravitational binding energy @xcite .",
    "for this reason , as the contracts , it becomes more bound and at the same time it looses angular momentum support .",
    "the first and third effect are dominant at early times , so the effect of turbulent viscosity is to monotonically reduce the compactness in the first few milliseconds after merger .",

    "[ fig : bns.hmns ] ; upper - left panel ) , so the compactness is slightly decreased compared to the reference run without turbulence dissipation . for the binary ,",
    "the effect of turbulent transport is qualitatively similar to the binary at early times .",
    "later , its envelope contracts causing the growth of the central density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bns.rho ] ; left panel ) and early formation .",
    "finally , in the case of the run the thermal effect prevails ; the hot spots formed in the contact layer at the time of merger sink to the center and enhance the core temperature to @xmath51 .",
    "the increased thermal support in the layers with @xmath52 inflates the . the reduced compactness , in turn , results in a decrease of the angular momentum loss due to and prevents its collapse within the simulation time .",
    "the changes in the structure are reflected in its multimessenger emissions . the total energy radiated in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bns.gw ] ; left panel ) is closely related to the rate of increase of the compactness .",
    "for this reason , at early times , the amplitude of the signal slightly decreases with @xmath31 , while , over longer timescales , the behavior is non - monotonic .",
    "the characteristic frequency after merger ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bns.gw ] ; right panel ) is , instead , only weakly affected , with the exception of a slight growth before formation , which is a commonly observed feature ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the neutrino emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bns.nulum ] ) is also influenced by the turbulent dissipation and the consequently higher temperatures in the .",
    "the luminosity of neutrinos of all flavours increases with the mixing length parameter up to @xmath53 .",
    "the luminosity of the simulation is , however , smaller than that of the simulation .",
    "this is possibly because , in the , the maximum of the temperature occurs at the center , while for the other models it is off - centered ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have developed a new framework for the modeling of turbulence in full- simulations .",
    "our approach is based on a relativistic extension of the large - eddy simulation technique , which represents the state - of - the - art for turbulence modeling in classical hydrodynamics @xcite .",

    "we have performed , for the first time , general - relativistic large - eddy simulations of merging with microphysical nuclear and neutrino cooling .",
    "we have found that turbulence can modify the structure and collapse time of the merger remnant .",
    "these , in turn , are reflected in the and neutrino emissions from the .",
    "the accretion rate after formation is also affected .",
    "the total energy radiated in is the most affected quantity , since it closely tracks the contraction of the on its way to the final collapse to . in the presence of very efficient turbulent transport ,",
    "the effective viscosity might mask changes in the compactness of the that would otherwise be attributable to changes in the high - density component of the @xcite .",
    "this effect is , however , only modest for more conservative choices of the turbulent mixing - length parameter . in these cases",
    ", turbulence would not significantly affect the prospect of detecting phase transitions in the core of the using observations .",
    "however , a definitive statement will have to wait until sufficiently resolved simulations are available to estimate @xmath31 .",
    "we have also found that the post - merger frequency is only weakly affected by the effective turbulent viscosity .",
    "thus , our results provide an important validation of the several proposed methods relying on its measure to constrain the of dense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "our results also reaffirm the observation by @xcite that the post - merger peak - frequency is set at the time of merger .",
    "afterwards , the frequency stays close to constant and is largely insensitive to the evolution of the , with the exception of the signature of formation .",
    "finally , our results show that the neutrino signal is also influenced by the turbulent dissipation of kinetic energy into heat .",
    "the increased temperatures and luminosities , especially for the anti - electron neutrinos , will influence the proton fraction in the outflows and might have an effect on the resulting nucleosynthetic yields @xcite .",
    "our results strongly suggest that turbulent dissipation will have to be included in the next generation of neutrino - radiation - hydrodynamics models of the outflows from merging .    here",
