    "the conventional bcs theory has been developed for a single - band metal with an attractive interaction between electrons with opposite spins and momenta ( s - wave , singlet pairing ) @xcite and describes well most low-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "the universality of the description of the superconductors is a consequence of an assumption about a simple shape of the fermi surface .",
    "however , some superconducting materials have a rather complicated band structure . for example",
    ", there is a consensus that the recently discovered new superconductor @xmath5 ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) is a two - band superconductor @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional bcs superconductors , two - band superconductors may have two different order parameters @xmath2 ( we label the bands by subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and an additional degree of freedom - the phase difference between the order parameters : @xmath10 .",
    "this is a new variable that has to be accounted for in the proper theory of such a superconductivity .",
    "naturally , one can expect new phenomena in two - band superconductors related to this new degree of freedom .",
    "one of the examples of this kind are @xmath11phase solitons predicted in @xcite . on the basis of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functional",
    "it was shown that these solitons are described by the sine - gordon equation . a gedanken - experiment that allows the observation of these solitons",
    "was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a two - band superconductor in contact with a normal metal n. using a version of the time - dependent gl equation , they analyzed a current through the s / n interface and showed that under certain conditions the phase solitons may be created in the superconductor .",
    "equation describing dynamics of these solitons is similar to the one for a dissipative josephson junction . in ref .",
    "@xcite an analogy between the ginzburg - landau functional for two - band superconductors and for some models in the particle physics ( an extended version of faddeev s nonlinear @xmath12 model ) was used and , on this basis , topologically different vortices in two - gap superconductors have been predicted . in ref.@xcite",
    "the critical current in these superconductors was calculated .",
    "another effect that can arise in two - band superconductors is weakly damped oscillations of the phase difference @xmath13 of the order parameters or , in other words , collective modes ( cms ) related to oscillations of the phase @xmath14 in space and time .",
    "it is known that in single - band superconductors cms can exist only at temperatures close to the critical temperature @xmath1 ( see reviews @xcite ) . in these modes the condensate current @xmath15 and the quasiparticle current @xmath16 oscillate .",
    "because the variation of the total current density @xmath17 should be zero due to the quasineutrality condition ( @xmath18 ) , the oscillations of @xmath19 are accompanied by counter - phase oscillations of the quasiparticle current @xmath20 .",
    "the phase of the order parameter also oscillates but the amplitude of the order parameter @xmath21 remains constant .",
    "these phase modes have an acoustic spectrum @xmath22 and exist in a sub - gap region ( @xmath23 ; where @xmath24 is the elastic scattering time ) in impure superconductors .",
    "the cms have been observed by carlson and goldman @xcite and explained theoretically in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that cms can not exist in conventional superconductors at zero temperature because in this limit only one degree of freedom , namely , the condensate current @xmath15 exists .",
    "any oscillations of the current density @xmath25 with not very high frequencies would lead to violation of the charge neutrality .",
    "in contrast , in two - band superconductors , even at zero temperature @xmath0 there are two degrees of freedom : the condensate currents @xmath26 in each band that can oscillate in counterphase such that the total current density remains constant : @xmath27 .",
    "this is similar to what happens in layered superconductors @xcite where the condensate currents in different layers oscillate in counterphase .",
    "the cms in the two - band superconductors at zero ( or low ) temperature are related to oscillations of the phase difference @xmath28 these cms are similar to the leggett mode that can be excited in superfluid @xmath29 @xcite .    theoretically , the leggett - type cms in two - band superconductors at zero temperature were studied in @xcite , and the influence of the cms on the josephson effect in s@xmath30/i / s@xmath31 was analyzed in @xcite ( here s@xmath32 is a single- and two - band superconductor ) .",
    "this leggett - type cm has a spectrum    @xmath33    which is typical for the josephson tunnel junction , where @xmath34 is a threshold frequency , @xmath35 is a velocity of this cm ( see sec .",
    "the similarity between the josephson `` plasma waves ''  and the leggett - type cm in two - band superconductors is quite natural because the coupling between different bands in two - band superconductors looks like the josephson coupling between superconductors in a josephson tunnel junction .",
    "according to estimates carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy corresponding to the threshold frequency @xmath34 in @xmath5 is higher than the smaller superconducting gap .",
    "this corresponds to a strong damping of the cms in this two - band superconductor .",
    "therefore it would be of interest to investigate under what conditions the gapless carlson - goldman cms can propagate in two - band superconductors and this is the subject of the present paper .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we formulate a model of two - band superconductors that will be used in calculations and present microscopic equations for quasiclassical green s functions .",
    "these equations determine the spatial and temporal behavior of the retarded ( advanced ) green s functions @xmath36 as well as of the keldysh function @xmath37 the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are matrices in the particle - hole ( gorkov - nambu ) space . using these equations",
    "we find a linear response @xmath40 and @xmath41 to small perturbations of the electric field and condensate velocities in both the bands .",
    "this give us possibility to find the spectrum of the cms at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "note that the spectrum of cms can not be obtained from the generalized gl equations used in @xcite . in sec.iv",
    "we analyze a method that may enable one to observe the cms .",
    "we start our discussion considering a simple model of a two - band superconductor and deriving microscopic equations for quasiclassical green s functions . using these equations",
    "we can obtain equations for macroscopic quantities and calculate the spectrum of cms .",
    "we restrict ourselves with the dirty limit assuming that the elastic impurity scattering time @xmath24 is sufficiently small : @xmath42 . in the equilibrium case these equations can be reduced to an usadel - like equation used in @xcite .",

    "we derive the relation between the phase difference @xmath334 and the applied voltage @xmath335 as well as the magnetic field @xmath267 in the main approximation , i.e. , in the absence of the josephson coupling .",
