    "strong gravitational lensing  the multiple imaging of a distant object by the gravity of an intervening object  provides a direct and accurate measurement of mass in the central regions of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this measurement is independent of the dynamical state of the lensing material and nearly independent of its radial density profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . until recently , strong lenses were relatively rare and heterogeneously selected , a fact which has imposed serious limitations on their utility for statistically significant scientific studies .",
    "systematic surveys employing various observational techniques have been conducted in an attempt to surmount this limitation . in the radio domain ,",
    "significant contributions to the number of known galaxy - scale lenses have been made by the survey of @xcite based on the parkes - mit - nrao catalog @xcite and by the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class : @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite predicted that large numbers of strong galaxy - galaxy lenses should be visible at optical wavelengths .",
    "many such systems have now been discovered through spectroscopic selection of candidate objects from within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) database by the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs : @xcite , hereafter papers  i  iv and vi  vii respectively ; also see @xcite and @xcite , hereafter b07 ) and the optimal line - of - sight survey ( ols ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerous strong galaxy - galaxy lenses and lens candidates have also been identified through various combinations of visual and automated inspection of large - area imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "finally , significant numbers of lensed quasars have been detected through _ hubble space telescope _",
    "snapshot observations of known quasars @xcite , by high - resolution ground - based surveys of the hamburg - eso bright quasar catalog @xcite , and by the sdss quasar lens search within the sdss imaging database @xcite . to these systematic discoveries",
    "one must also add the many serendipitously discovered strong lenses that comprise a large fraction of the known lens population .    here",
    "we report the observational results of the slacs survey from its initiation through the deactivation of the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in 2007 january . from among 131 successfully observed candidates ,",
    "we confirm a total of 70 secure strong gravitational lenses and a further 19 possible gravitational lenses , making the slacs survey the most productive strong - lens survey to date . as a consequence of the spectroscopic selection method , all of the slacs lenses have known spectroscopic redshifts for both foreground and background galaxies , giving the slacs sample an immediate quantitative scientific advantage over strong - lens candidate samples selected from imaging data .",
    "this paper represents the definitive source for slacs survey data , pending the publication of multi - color _ hst _ photometry ( primarily from the wfpc2 instrument ) currently being completed during observing cycle 16 , and of a modest number of additional lenses confirmed with wfpc2 imaging during cycle 15 .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in  [ sample ]",
    "we describe the candidate selection and _ hst _ observing strategy .",
    "section  [ datared ] presents our data - reduction procedures .",
    "section  [ photomet ] describes the photometric modeling methods that we apply to the images of the foreground galaxies .",
    "we employ both elliptical radial b - spline models ( to obtain detailed light profiles and to generate residual images for strong lens modeling ) and elliptical @xcite models ( to measure global magnitudes and structural parameters ) .",
    "the details of our strong gravitational lens analysis are presented in  [ lensan ] .",
    "our lens classification procedure and an overview of the resulting lens sample is presented in  [ lenshyp ] .",
    "section  [ lensmod ] describes our strong - lens mass modeling procedure as applied to 63 of the secure strong lens systems , yielding the aperture - mass measurements that enable the scientific applications of the sample . in  [ mcomp ]",
    "we compare our measurements with quantities obtained through other methods , as a cross check and in order to make realistic estimates of our measurement errors .",
    "section  [ compsample ] examines the representativeness of the slacs lenses among early - type galaxies in general .",
    "we summarize and offer some concluding remarks in  [ sumcon ] .",
    "appendix  [ dataapp ] provides complete data tables and image figures , as well as comments on the 7 secure lenses that do not admit simple lens - modeling analysis .    throughout this work , we assume a general - relativistic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology with matter - density parameter @xmath7 , vacuum energy - density parameter @xmath8 , and hubble parameter @xmath9kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 .",
    "magnitudes are quoted in the ab system .",
    "the gravitational lenses presented in this work were all selected from the spectroscopic database of the sdss based on the presence of absorption - dominated galaxy continuum at one redshift and nebular emission lines ( balmer series , [ oii]3727 , or [ oiii]5007 ) at another , higher redshift .",
    "the spectroscopic lens survey technique was first envisioned by  @xcite and @xcite following the serendipitous discovery of the gravitational lens 0047@xmath102808 through the presence of high - redshift lyman-@xmath11 emission in the spectrum of the targeted lower redshift elliptical galaxy .",
    "further details of our particular approach are provided in @xcite and paper  i. the slacs survey includes candidates from the sdss main galaxy sample @xcite in addition to candidates from the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite .",
    "most candidates were selected on the basis of multiple emission lines , though several lens candidates were observed under _",
    "hst _ program # 10886 on the basis of secure [ oii]3727 line detections alone . by virtue of this spectroscopic selection method ,",
    "all slacs lenses and lens candidates have secure foreground ( `` lens '' ) and background ( `` source '' ) redshifts from the outset .",
    "accurate redshifts such as these are essential to all quantitative scientific applications of strong lensing .    from among the set of spectroscopically identified candidates , target lists for follow - up _",
    "hst _ imaging observations were created based on a number of competing considerations : ( 1 ) maximal nominal lensing cross sections , as determined from foreground and background redshifts and sdss velocity dispersions using a singular isothermal sphere model ; ( 2 ) a reasonably uniform distribution in lens redshifts and velocity dispersions , within the limits of feasibility ; and ( 3 ) the significance of the spectroscopic detection of background emission lines .",
    "the selected candidates were observed under three discovery programs : # 10174 ( cycle 13 , pi : l. koopmans ) , # 10587 ( cycle 14 , pi : a. bolton ) , and # 10886 ( cycle 15 , pi : a. bolton ) .",
    "program # 10174 was executed as a snapshot program , with two 420-s exposures per visit : one through the f435w filter and one through the f814w filter .",
    "10587 was originally implemented identically to # 10174 , but the f435w exposures were canceled early in the observing cycle , since the advent of 2-gyro _ hst _ guiding had significantly reduced snapshot program execution rates relative to previous cycles .",
    "this reduction in snapshot execution rates somewhat compromised the specific goal of program # 10587 to obtain a greater number of lower - mass gravitational lens galaxies , which have a lower confirmation rate by virtue of their smaller lensing cross section .",
    "nevertheless , as seen in b07 and paper  vii , the resulting combined slacs lens sample has sufficient leverage in mass to define mass - dynamical and mass - luminosity scaling relations for the luminous early - type galaxy population .",
    "program # 10886 was executed as a general observer ( go ) program , with one orbit per target through the f814w filter , split among four closely dithered pointings .",
    "new lenses confirmed by these discovery programs were subsequently scheduled for observation with full orbits and through complementary filters under programs # 10494 , # 10798 , and # 11202 ( cycles 14 , 15 , and 16 , respectively ; pi : l. koopmans ) .",
    "all programs used the wide - field channel ( wfc ) of the acs until the untimely demise of that camera in 2007 january prompted a transfer of the program to wfpc2 .",
    "the work presented here is based on the full slacs _",
    "hst_-acs dataset , and includes data from all slacs programs except # 11202 , which is carried out entirely with the wfpc2 .",
    "the analysis in the current paper makes exclusive use of the f814w ( @xmath12-band ) data , since all acs targets were observed at least once through this filter .",
    "multi - color coverage of the slacs lens sample is currently being obtained under program # 11202 ; multi - band results based on acs , wfpc2 , and nicmos data will be published following the completion of _ hst _ observing cycle 16 .",
    "all acs frames were downloaded from the online archive at the space telescope science institute on 2007 april 03 , having been processed by version 4.6.1 of the ` calacs ` calibration software .",
    "the following steps were applied to all frames , after the generation of a catalog file associating multiple exposure , filters , and visits to the same unique target with one another :    1 .   from the `` flt '' file ,",
    "extract the central 1500@xmath131500 pixel ( roughly @xmath14 ) section of the acs wf1 aperture , in which the targets were centered .",
    "2 .   subtract the sky level as determined by the ` multidrizzle ` software and recorded in the ` mdrizsky ` header parameter .",
    "3 .   identify and mask significantly negative `` cold pixels '' in the cutout , then process the cutout with the l.a . cosmic software ( @xcite , as implemented in idl ) in order to identify and mask cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "4 .   tabulate manually the approximate pixel location of the target galaxy in each exposure . for multi - exposure visits , obtain the approximate shift between exposures through image cross correlation .",
    "5 .   use the distortion information in the fits headers to generate tangent - plane ra and dec coordinate images relative to a fixed reference pixel . 6 .   find the centroid of the target galaxy in each frame by fitting an elliptical moffat profile as a function of ra and dec ( without point - spread function convolution ) to the image using the",
    "` mpfit2dpeak ` non - linear fitting routine in idl .",
    "rectify the individual frames onto a uniform @xmath15 grid ( centered on the ra and dec centroid from the previous step ) via bilinear interpolation within the images as dictated by the distortion solution .",
    "also rectify , with identical sampling , an appropriate model point - spread function ( psf ) as determined by the tiny tim software @xcite using an input spectral energy distribution equal to the median of all normalized sdss spectra of slacs targets .",
    "divide the counts and count - errors of each frame by the exposure time to convert to counts per second .",
    "9 .   for sets of multiple dithered exposures , combine all exposures into a single stacked exposure , with an additional cr - rejection step",
    "similarly , combine the psf samplings corresponding to the individual exposures .",
    "visually classify all targets for multiplicity and morphology .",
    "systems with two or more foreground galaxies of comparable luminosity are classified as `` multiple '' , while systems with only a single dominant foreground galaxy are classified as `` single '' .",
    "morphological classification is made by a consensus of the authors through the inspection of f814w acs data alone , and is limited to the categories of `` early - type '' ( elliptical and s0 ) , `` late - type '' ( sa and later spirals ) , and `` unclassified '' ( generally ambiguous between s0 and sa ) .",
    "we adopt this recipe in preference to the ` multidrizzle ` reduction package because the `` drizzle '' re - sampling algorithm @xcite is not well suited to single - exposure snapshot data . by using the above reduction procedure for both snapshot and dithered multi - exposure imaging data",
    ", we guarantee that our analysis is as uniform as possible .",
    "this section describes the details of our acs f814w surface photometry",
    ". this photometric modeling pertains exclusively to the bright , foreground galaxy in each candidate lens system : i.e. , the `` lens '' in the case of a bona fide strong lens system .",
    "these photometric models serve to characterize the brightnesses , sizes , and shapes of the foreground galaxies , as well as to generate model - subtracted residual images of the background galaxies suitable for the strong - lensing classification and modeling described in  [ lensmod ] . depending upon the particular application ,",
    "we use either radial b - spline models or @xcite models .",
    "direct f814w images of all acs targets are shown in figure  [ allimage ] ( in appendix  [ dataapp ] ) .",
    "slacs provides a sample of bright lensing galaxies with relatively faint lensed galaxies in the background .",
    "while this is a benefit to the study of the lens galaxies themselves , it presents a challenge for strong - lens mass models that must be fitted to those faint lensed features .",
    "we address this challenge with the radial b - spline galaxy image modeling technique , introduced in paper  i. radial b - splines provide a generalized basis for modeling the radial luminosity profile of early - type galaxies , including low - order angular effects through the inclusion of multipole terms . by virtue of their significant freedom ,",
    "the radial b - spline models are able to produce very cleanly subtracted residual images of the ( often lensed ) background galaxies ; by contrast , the best - fit de vaucouleurs or @xcite models in many cases leave systematic residuals at count levels comparable to those of the relatively faint strongly lensed features .    in this work ,",
    "we use radial b - spline models not only to generate residual images , but also as the basis for aperture photometry and light - traces - mass lens models ( see  [ lensmod ] below ) .",
    "motivated by this goal , we implement the modeling in a somewhat different manner than in paper  i , incorporating an overall isophotal ellipticity and solving for psf - deconvolved models .",
    "specifically , we define a generalized elliptical radial coordinate , @xmath16 where the @xmath17 coordinate system has the lens galaxy center at its origin and is aligned with the principal axes of the galaxy image .",
    "the lens - galaxy light profile is then modeled as a b - spline function of @xmath18 as described in paper  i , with the lens - galaxy isophotal axis ratio @xmath19 , the position of the lens center @xmath20 , and the major - axis position angle of the galaxy image ( measured e from n ) as non - linear model parameters in addition to the linear b - spline coefficient amplitudes . for a given trial choice of the non - linear parameters ,",
    "basis images corresponding to the b - spline coefficients are generated and convolved with the appropriate psf , and the linear combination of these basis images that best fits the data is computed .",
    "we perform the b - spline model fits to the sky - subtracted imaging data over a @xmath21 region centered on the target lens candidate galaxies .",
    "the box size is chosen primarily to extend well beyond the scale of all lensed features and half - light radii . before fitting",
    ", we manually generate masks for stars , neighboring galaxies , and possible lensed features so as to exclude those pixels from the fits .",
    "the initial b - spline modeling includes no higher - order multipole terms , and solves for the non - linear parameters by minimizing the @xmath22 statistic using the idl ` mpfit ` implementation of the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite .",
    "the residual images produced by subtracting these initial models are then examined , and the masks are manually grown to exclude features not flagged in the original images . a second round of b - spline models is then computed by fixing the non - linear parameters and allowing for the following combinations of multipole terms in the fit : none , quadrupole , quadrupole@xmath23octopole , dipole , dipole@xmath23quadrupole .",
    "the inclusion of these terms allows the model to fit the effects of diskiness / boxiness , isophotal twist , variable ellipticity with radius , and an imperfect psf model . we inspect the residual images generated by subtracting these model fits and",
    "select a particular multipole combination .",
    "models are preferred in the order given in the preceding list , with later models being adopted only if they provide visibly significant improvement over earlier models .",
    "the inclusion of dipole terms is necessary for some systems in order to model slight asymmetry in the galaxy image .",
    "a small number of systems ( mostly edge - on s0s ) require multipole orders beyond the simple list ; those systems are handled separately , with additional multipole orders added until the residual images are satisfactory for strong - lensing analysis .",
    "this special handling is only done for systems whose direct images show possible evidence of strong lensing ( see figures  [ allimage ] and  [ prettypics ] in appendix  [ dataapp ] ) .      to compute standardized model magnitudes , effective radii @xmath24 , and projected axis ratios of the slacs targets , we fit the images with two - dimensional ellipsoidal de vaucouleurs luminosity profiles .",
    "these fits are performed over a @xmath25 square region centered on the target galaxies ( approximately half the narrower dimension of the wf1 ccd aperture in which the targets were rougly centered ) .",
    "the manually created masks from the b - spline stage are applied in the central regions ; stars and neighboring galaxies outside the manually masked area are masked from the de vaucouleurs fit with a single - step `` clipping '' of pixels that deviate by more than 4 sigma higher than the model .",
    "the fits are performed using the ` mpfit2dfun ` procedure in idl , and include convolution with the appropriate rectified and stacked tiny tim psf .",
    "the initial optimization is done by sampling the model at one point per data pixel ; a final optimization is done with @xmath26 sub - sampling per pixel .",
    "model magnitudes are computed from the full ( not truncated ) analytic integral of the best - fit de  vaucouleurs model .",
    "effective radii are quoted at the intermediate axis : i.e. , the geometric mean of the major and minor axes of the elliptical isophotal contour enclosing one - half the model flux .    to test for bias in the de  vaucouleurs model - based magnitude measurements ,",
    "we compare to aperture fluxes evaluated using the more general b - spline luminosity - profile models of  [ bsphot ] .",
    "we consider an aperture defined by twice the de  vaucouleurs effective radius , which in the de  vaucouleurs case encloses 69% of the total model flux .",
    "we exclude ten galaxies whose effective radius exceeds the range modeled by the b - spline method above . the mean fractional difference ( b - spline minus de  vaucouleurs ) in aperture flux values across the sample is 1.0% , with an rms difference of 2.3% .",
    "thus we see that the de  vaucouleurs magnitudes are in good agreement with magnitudes determined through less parametric methods .    in order to obtain rest - frame photometric quantities",
    ", we apply several corrections to the observed @xmath12-band magnitudes .",
    "we apply corrections for galactic dust extinction using the values of @xcite .",
    "we also apply @xmath27-corrections to transform observed @xmath12-band magnitudes to rest - frame @xmath28-band magnitudes : these two passbands are very well matched for the higher redshift slacs lenses , and reasonably close in wavelength for the lower redshift lenses . since multi - band observations are not available for the full target sample , and",
    "since the sdss colors will in general be affected by contributions from the background galaxies , we apply a single redshift - dependent @xmath27-correction based upon a single - burst synthetic stellar population @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "these same @xmath27-corrections were used in the analysis of paper  iv , and should be well suited to the old stellar populations fund in the slacs lenses ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "we expect these @xmath27-corrections to be accurate to better than 0.05mag @xcite .",
    "forthcoming multi - band _ hst _ photometry for the full slacs lens sample will permit measurement of lens - galaxy colors separately from those of the background galaxies , thus enabling the most accurate @xmath27-corrections .",
    "the @xmath27 corrections applied in b07 included a computational error that has been corrected in the current analysis ( and that does not alter the conclusions of that work , as can be seen in paper  vii ) .",
    "we derive corrections to absolute luminosity using the adopted @xmath29 frw cosmology . finally , we correct for luminosity evolution in the sample assuming a rate of @xmath30 @xcite , derived from the evolution of the fundamental plane relationship ( fp * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ideally we would like to constrain this evolution rate directly within the slacs sample , but the sample probes systematically more massive and luminous galaxies at higher redshift , and thus evolutionary trends are significantly covariant with mass / luminosity trends ( see figure  [ distribs ] in  [ lenshyp ] below ) .",
    "the evolution correction that we apply here is the same as was adopted in paper  iv , though here we correct luminosities to @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 . in either case , the rms variation about the sample mean luminosity correction is on the order of a few hundredths dex , since the slacs sample does not span an especially wide range in redshift .",
    "the measured photometric parameters for the full slacs target sample are presented in table  [ obstable ] ( in appendix  [ dataapp ] ) , along with sdss names / coordinates , redshifts , and velocity dispersions .",
    "this section presents the details of our strong - lensing analysis .",
    "the first evidence in support of the strong - lensing hypothesis is the presence of two distinct galaxy redshifts within the same sdss spectrum , covering a 3@xmath33 diameter spatial region , which forms the basis of our _ hst_-acs target selection .",
    "further evidence is provided by the appearance of features characteristic of strong lensing in our high - resolution _ hst _ follow - up imaging , by successful quantitative strong - lensing models of those features , and in some cases by spatially resolve spectroscopy of the background - redshift emission - line flux .",
    "the classification of observed candidates into lenses and non - lenses is made by visual examination of the direct and b - spline model - subtracted residual images in all available _ hst_-acs bands , based on the appearance of arcs , rings , and multiple images centered on the position of the foreground galaxy .",
    "initially , this classification is made independently by three different subsets of the authors ( asb , rg , and lvek @xmath23 tt ) .",
    "out of the systems selected as definite lenses by any one individual initial judgment , the percentage of unanimously agreed - upon definite lenses ranges from 77% to 87% .",
    "subsequently , all systems are inspected simultaneously by a single group of authors ( asb @xmath23 lvek @xmath23 tt @xmath23 lam ) , and a consensus classification into definite lenses ( `` grade a '' ) , possible lenses ( `` grade b '' ) , and non - lenses or systems of unknown status ( `` grade x '' ) is decided , additionally taking into account integral - field spectroscopic evidence where available ( see below ) . in the case of grade - a systems , the acs direct and residual images show clear evidence of multiple imaging of a background galaxy consistent with general strong - lensing geometries . for grade b systems , the acs data show evidence of probable multiple imaging , but have either a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) too low for reliable lens modeling and definitive conclusion , or some degree of ambiguity in the identification of lensed features .",
    "we anticipate that the majority of the grade - b systems will be promoted to grade - a upon the completion of deeper imaging in multiple bands .",
    "grade x is a catch - all classification that includes systems where the background galaxy is only singly imaged ( i.e. , positioned at large impact parameter relative to the foreground galaxy ) and systems where the likely source of background - redshift line emission is either undetected or very weakly detected in the acs imaging . in principle ,",
    "grade - x systems with a background galaxy at large impact parameter are also a matter of insufficient snr , since at arbitrary imaging depth some part of any background galaxy may be seen to be strongly lensed",
    ". however , practical confirmation and measurement seems out of reach for these systems .",
    "the consensus classifications of all acs targets are given in table  [ obstable ] in appendix  [ dataapp ] .",
    "out of a total of 131 successfully observed targets , we confirm a total of 70 grade - a lenses , 19 grade - b lenses , and 42 non - lenses ( grade x ) .",
    "the numerical breakdown of lenses confirmed in each of the three discovery programs ( # 10174 , # 10587 , and # 10886 ) is presented in table  [ tot_table ] .",
    "figure  [ distribs ] shows the distribution of slacs targets and confirmed lenses in redshift , velocity dispersion , and luminosity .",
    "one can see the significant covariance between magnitude and redshift  fundamentally a consequence of the sdss spectroscopic target selection  that prevents us from using the slacs lens sample to track the evolution of a single population across redshift .",
    "we must rather assume a rate of luminosity evolution as we have done here , or alternatively assume that the sample evolves onto the locally observed fp relation at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "this latter approach will be feasible once multi - band photometry of the slacs lens sample is complete ."
