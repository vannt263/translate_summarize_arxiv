    "bars are among the most prominent features of disc galaxies .",
    "their share in the galaxy population depends on the criteria employed . in the local universe bars",
    "are hosted by at least @xmath2 of disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "if one includes also weak bars , the fraction may be as high as @xmath3 .",
    "looking into the past , the fraction of strong bars declines , down to @xmath4 at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there are some indications that the number of barred galaxies may depend on the environment , in particular it may be higher in denser regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that bright dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster exhibit a bar fraction of @xmath6 .",
    "the subject of bar physics is very broad and here we recount only the most important facts . for more details , the reader can refer to recent reviews of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the possible ways to create a barred galaxy is via global instability occurring in a cold disk .",
    "already in the first @xmath0-body simulations it was found that discs of galaxies are often unstable @xcite and prone to the formation of a bar - like feature in their centers . from the analysis of the orbital structure of such objects @xcite concluded that bars should be smaller than the corotation radius @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite , analysing response of galaxies to forcings of different extent , also reached a similar conclusion .",
    "later , the simulations of @xcite confirmed this upper limit to the bar length and also added a lower limit , suggesting that the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar length @xmath8 should be in a range @xmath9 .",
    "about two - thirds of galaxies with determined pattern speed are fast and almost all of them exhibit @xmath10 @xcite .    shortly after formation ,",
    "bars undergo a vertical instability called buckling @xcite .",
    "it leads to the thickening of the bar and is responsible for the development of the boxy / peanut bulges in disc galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the further evolution of the bar is governed by the transfer of the angular momentum , which is emitted by the resonances in the bar region and absorbed by the resonances in the outer parts of the disc and particularly in the dark matter halo . as a result",
    ", the bar slows down and is able to grow .",
    "the formation of bars was also studied in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "bars may also form in response to an interaction with a perturber , which was first studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such bars seem to be similar to the ones formed in isolation , however , there are two important differences .",
    "if the galaxy is initially sufficiently stable against spontaneous bar formation , the pattern speed of a tidally induced bar is not decreasing in a secular fashion , but remains constant @xcite .",
    "moreover , such bars are usually slow , having @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that such values of @xmath12 are caused by the transfer of the angular momentum to the perturber .",
    "encounters between galaxies have been known for a long time to change the appearance and structure of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "tidal force influences the evolution of galaxies in groups @xcite and clusters @xcite . in the tidal stirring scenario , disky dwarf galaxies",
    "are transformed into dwarf spheroidals , both in the case of dwarfs around normal - size galaxies @xcite and in clusters @xcite . during the first encounter with the host galaxy , a bar develops in the disc of the dwarf @xcite . at subsequent pericenter passages",
    "the disc thickens and later on it is transformed into a spheroid .",
    "if the tidal stirring scenario is valid , we may expect to find some dwarfs with hints of bar presence in the local group .",
    "there is evidence that the elongated shape of the sagittarius , ursa minor and carina dwarfs @xcite may be the result of the bar phase they underwent during their tidal evolution .",
    "in addition , also the ultra - faint dwarfs hercules and ursa major ii exhibit bar - like shapes @xcite . of course",
    ", the tidally induced bars may form not only in the local group , but also in other dwarf galaxies interacting with their hosts .",
    "one of the possible examples is a small galaxy in the arp 83 system ( also known as ngc 3799 ) , which seems to interact with a larger host ngc 3800 .",
    "recently , @xcite studied in detail the evolution of a tidally induced bar in a dwarf orbiting around a milky way - like galaxy . here",
    ", we extend their results to different orbital configurations .",
    "the main issue we focus on is the impact of two parameters on the bar formation .",
    "we study the outcome of varying the orbit size ( i.e. peri- and apocentric distances ) and the inclination of the dwarf s disc with respect to the orbit .",
    "we also draw some more general conclusions regarding tidally induced bars .",

    ".basic properties of the simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our simulation setup resembles the one adopted by @xcite .",
    "we constructed @xmath0-body models of the dwarf and the host galaxy .",
    "both consist of a spherical nfw @xcite dark matter halo , which is exponentially truncated at the virial radius , and an exponential stellar disc .",
    "the models were generated using procedures described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each component of each galaxy was made of @xmath13 particles .",
    "according to @xcite such a number of particles is sufficient to faithfully reproduce the evolution of a barred galaxy .    to model the dwarf",
    ", we used a dark matter halo of the @xmath14 m@xmath15 virial mass and a concentration of @xmath16 .",
    "the exponential stellar disc has a mass of @xmath17 m@xmath15 , a radial scale - length of @xmath18 kpc and a vertical scale - length of @xmath19 kpc .",
    "the host galaxy was designed to resemble the milky way .",
    "its dark matter halo virial mass was set to @xmath20 m@xmath15 and its concentration to @xmath21 .",
    "the exponential disc has a mass of @xmath22 m@xmath15 , the radial scale - length is @xmath23 kpc and the vertical scale - length is @xmath24 kpc .",
    "we constructed the dwarf galaxy model ensuring that it is stable against spontaneous bar formation .",
    "@xcite s @xcite stability criterion reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath27 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath28 is the surface density of the disk and @xmath29 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we plotted the initial profile of @xmath30 for the dwarf galaxy in figure  [ fig_q_param ] .",
    "the minimum value is equal to @xmath31 , hence no bar should grow in its disk for times comparable to the evolution times considered here .",
    "we verified this by running an additional @xmath32 gyr simulation of the dwarf galaxy in isolation .",
    "the model of the host galaxy has a similar property , having a minimum value of @xmath33 .",
    "however , the bar in the host would probably have no impact on the gravitational potential felt by the dwarf on its orbit .",
    "we intended to gauge the impact of two factors on the bar formation : the size of the orbit of the dwarf galaxy and the inclination of its stellar disc with respect to the orbit .",
    "we chose a fiducial simulation of a pericenter @xmath34 kpc , an apocenter @xmath35 kpc and fully in - plane prograde orientation of the disc .",
    "it means that in the beginning the disc lies in the same plane as the orbit of the dwarf and rotates in the same direction as it orbits the host galaxy .",
    "such an orientation maximizes the impact of the tidal interaction @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this simulation as run m0 ( where the letter ` m ' stands for medium - size orbit and the number ` 0 ' indicates the inclination angle in degrees ) .    in the next two runs we changed the size of the orbit , keeping the ratio of the apocenter to the pericenter distance equal to the typical values of @xmath36 , as well as the in - plane prograde orientation . in the run s0 ( ` s ' for small ) the orbit was tighter than m0 , with the pericenter of @xmath16  kpc and the apocenter of @xmath37 kpc .",
    "the l0 ( ` l '  for large ) orbit was wider , with the pericenter at @xmath38 kpc and the apocenter at @xmath39 kpc .",
    "in two other runs we varied the inclination angle of the dwarf s disc , while keeping the same , medium , orbit size .",
    "compared to run m0 , we rotated the disc around the line connecting the initial position of the dwarf and the host center in anticlockwise direction , as viewed from the host . in run",
    "m45 we rotated the disc by @xmath40 , while in run m90 the disc was rotated by @xmath41 , so it was perpendicular to the plane of the orbit . the simulation runs are summarized in table [ tab_simulations ] .",
    "we listed the designations of the runs , the apo- and pericenter distances , as  well as the initial disc inclinations . in the last column",
    "we give colors , which we will use for a given simulation throughout the paper .",
    "to give the simulations a gentle start , we always initially place the dwarfs at the apocenters of their orbits .",
    "the initial orbital velocity is set so as to reach the desired distance at the pericenter . throughout the simulation runs , the orbits of the dwarfs",
    "do not decay significantly .",
    "the pericenter distances remain almost constant , while the apocenters decrease by less than @xmath4 .    to run the simulations we used the publicly available code gadget2 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the system was followed for @xmath32 gyr and outputs were saved every @xmath42 gyr . for the dwarf we adopted the following softening lengths : @xmath43 kpc for the stellar particles and @xmath44 kpc for the dark matter particles . in the case of the host galaxy , we used @xmath42 kpc for the stellar component and @xmath45 kpc for the dark matter halo .",
    "+    +    +    +          in the following we will be using a reference frame aligned with the bar .",
    "the principal axes of the bar were determined through diagonalization of the inertia tensor @xcite , calculated for the particles inside an ellipsoid of semi - major axis length equal to @xmath46 kpc .",
    "we rotate the reference frame in such a way that the @xmath47-axis is aligned with the major axis of the bar , the @xmath48-axis with the intermediate and the with the minor one . in this task , as well as for computing other quantities",
    ", we used the scale of @xmath46 kpc , which is slightly smaller than our typical bar lengths . in principle",
    ", we could have used the bar length itself for this purpose , however we decided to refrain from this because it would make it difficult to disentangle the intrinsic changes of a given quantity and the variation due to the change of the bar length . moreover ,",
    "the length of the bar itself is not an easily defined quantity @xcite .    in figure [ fig_density_maps ]",
    "we show surface density maps of the dwarfs after their first pericenter passage ( strictly speaking , at  their second apocenters ) and at the end of the simulations ( after @xmath32 gyr ) . at the latter time , all of them are close to their next apocenter , so their shapes are not very disturbed . in all the dwarfs , bars are clearly visible after the first pericenter passage , but their lengths and shapes are different .",
    "there are no peanut shapes visible in the edge - on views , hence it seems that the dwarfs did not undergo recognizable buckling .",
    "the end products of the evolution are also diverse but in all the dwarfs the central stellar distributions remain elongated .",
    "first , let us examine the influence of the orbit size .",
    "in the course of the simulation , the fiducial dwarf m0 became almost spherical and only its center remained elongated . early in its life , the bar formed in dwarf  s0 ( on the tighter orbit ) is slightly less extended than the bar in m0 . at the end , the dwarf is smaller and rounder due to enhanced tidal stripping .",
    "the bar in run l0 ( wider orbit ) is also shorter than m0 .",
    "an elongated shape visible in the face - on view at the second apocenter , inclined to the bar in the center , originates from winding up of spiral arms and will be discussed later on .",
    "this run is the only one in which the dwarf remained clearly disky until the end , with an easily discernible bar .",
    "it is the result of the fact that the l0 dwarf experienced only two pericenter passages .    in the case of the inclined dwarfs ( m45 and m90 )",
    "there is plenty of material out of the disc plane after the first pericenter .",
    "it was torn off the disc by the tidal force because both discs are inclined with respect to the plane of the orbit .",
    "the bars get shorter with growing inclination , however the final shapes of the dwarfs m45 and m90 are qualitatively similar to the m0 case .",
    "the total amount of stripped material strongly correlates with the size of the orbit .",
    "thus , the dwarf on the s0 orbit lost the largest amount of matter , as expected , while the one on l0 the least .",
    "the dwarfs on the same orbit ( m0 , m45 , m90 ) lost a similar fraction of mass , but the trend between them is such that the fraction drops with the inclination ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig_shape ] depicts the evolution of the dwarf stellar component shape .",
    "we quantify it in terms of the axis ratios : intermediate to major ( @xmath49 ) , minor to major ( @xmath50 ) and minor to intermediate ( @xmath51 ) . in the calculations of the axis ratios we used stellar particles inside ellipsoids of semi - major axis equal to @xmath46 kpc , hence",
    "approximately @xmath52  kpc .",
    "this length is of the order of the bar sizes , so here we actually measure the _ bar _ shapes .",
    "all the dwarfs were initially axially symmetric discs ( @xmath53 ) , but their shapes changed abruptly at the first pericenter passage .",
    "this hints that the bar forms in a short time at the first pericenter , as we will show in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec_bars ] .",
    "later on , the parameters are usually constant between pericenters . at the pericenters ,",
    "the measured shape may fluctuate significantly , as can be seen especially in the case of run s0 , in which there are large spikes in @xmath49 .",
    "this is related to the fact that at pericenter the bars are not necessarily oriented along the line from the dwarf to the host , along which the tidal force acts .",

    "this turned out to be true , however it was barely noticeable .",
    "we note the bars initially have @xmath60 , indicating they are not axisymmetric , prolate ellipsoids .",
    "however , the dwarfs s0 and m0 reach such a state at the end of the runs .",
    "the impact of the inclination on the elongation is such that for a more inclined disk the bar is initially less elongated and remains so . on the other hand ,",
    "the change in thickness ( measured by @xmath50 ) is similar for all the dwarfs m0 , m45 , and m90 .",
    "we used the methods mentioned earlier @xcite to measure how the shape of the stellar component varies with the distance from the center of the dwarf .",
    "according to @xcite , the axis ratios obtained by this method correspond to ellipsoidal shells of constant density .",
    "in addition to the axis ratios , to quantify the shape we also use a triaxiality parameter @xmath54 , defined as @xmath61 an object with @xmath57 can be considered oblate ( disky ) and if @xmath55 it is prolate ( cigar - like ) . for the intermediate values of @xmath54 the shape is triaxial . in figures [ fig_shape_lin ] and [ fig_shape_lin_new ] we present the axis ratios and @xmath54 as a function of distance along the major axis . as in the case of the surface density maps ( figure  [ fig_density_maps ] )",
    ", we show the results when the dwarfs were at the second apocenter and at the end of the simulations .",
    "after the first pericenter passage the profiles of the axis ratios are qualitatively similar for all dwarfs .",
    "the discs remained thin ( @xmath62 ) , with an exception of the outer parts of the inclined runs ( m45 and especially m90 ) , which is caused by the material pulled out of the disc plane by the tides .",

    "further out , it drops abruptly , which corresponds to the end of the bar .",
    "however , it barely drops to @xmath66 , hence the shape is not fully disky , but rather triaxial .",
    "the prominent exception is run l0 , whose outer parts remained disky because of the large pericenter distance .",
    "the very central parts ( @xmath67 kpc ) appear to be rounder than the bars .",
    "we caution that it might be the effect of insufficient resolution .",

    "both smaller and larger pericenter distances lead to a shorter bar .",
    "higher inclination of the disc also leads to bar suppression .",
    "the shapes of the dwarf galaxies at the end of the runs are different and depend strongly on the initial conditions . in runs m0 and s0",
    "the stellar component in the center became axisymmetric ( @xmath71 ) , while remaining prolate .",
    "the elongated part is smaller and thicker than in the beginning , while its outskirts developed into a spherical envelope . at the end , s0 is less elongated and more axisymmetric than m0 and we can consider it to be more evolved due to a larger number of closer pericenter passages . as we have seen before ,",
    "run l0 is different , with bar becoming more prominent and longer .",
    "in addition , its outer parts retained the shape of a thin disc .    in the case of the inclined discs we can see a different progression at the end of the simulations .",
    "while the thickness profiles ( @xmath50 ) of runs m45 and m90 resemble the one of run m0 , the ratio @xmath49 is different .",

    "the evolution of @xmath92 is presented in figure [ fig_omega_p ] .",

    "soon after formation all bars have a similar pattern speed of @xmath97 gyr@xmath98 , however the detailed hierarchy corresponds to the reversed order of strength , as could have been expected from previous studies @xcite . later on",
    "we can observe short - term variation , especially at the pericenter passages , when the bars are highly distorted and @xmath86 is dominated by the elongation due to the proximity of the host .",
    "the tidal force also exerts a torque on the bar , as discussed by @xcite , which may affect the bar rotation in the vicinity of the pericenter .",
    "we verified that the changes of the pattern speed are not driven by the mass loss .",
    "the evolution of both stellar and dark matter mass in the bar region is very similar for the three dwarfs on the same orbit ( m0 , m45 and m90 ) , yet their @xmath92 varies differently .",
    "apart from short - timescale fluctuations , we notice also long - term trends . in case of the in - plane",
    "prograde dwarfs on small - pericenter orbits ( s0 and m0 ) , bars are significantly slowing down and finally halt after a few pericenters .",

    "the slowdown is more gradual in l0 and m90 runs . in m45",
    "the pattern speed appears to be on average constant . in all cases , the evolution of @xmath92 has trends similar to those of the mean rotation velocity change shown in figure  [ fig_rotation ] .",
    "the most obvious property of a bar is its length .",
    "@xcite discussed various methods to estimate it .",
    "we note there is no method to measure the bar size unambiguously and many of them require setting some _ ad hoc _ parameters .",
    "we decided to employ a method inspired by the aforementioned paper .",
    "we define the bar semi - major axis length as the distance from the center where triaxiality @xmath54 obtained from our algorithm drops below @xmath100 of its maximal value .",
    "we motivate this choice by the fact that @xmath54 profiles are quite flat in the center and further outside drop steeply .",
    "our selected threshold intends to reflect this drop .    , measured from the drop in triaxiality , as a function of time . to smooth the results , we applied a moving average over three consecutive outputs .",
    "dashed parts of the lines correspond to periods when the bar length determination was not possible .",
    "the vertical lines indicate pericenter passages . ]    in figure [ fig_bar_length ] we depicted the evolution of the bar lengths .",
    "we note that at some outputs we were unable to determine @xmath101 .",
    "the typical reason was that the dwarfs at pericenters , or shortly afterwards , were so disturbed that our method did not work , mainly because @xmath54 grew all the way from the center to the outskirts . as was the case for many other properties discussed so far ,",
    "@xmath101 is quite stable between pericenters , while it usually changes after each pericenter passage .",
    "hence , the bars do not undergo significant secular evolution .",
    "the longest bar was formed in dwarf m0 , whereas in runs with smaller ( s0 ) and larger ( l0 ) orbit size the bar was initially shorter .",
    "furthermore , there is a trend with disc inclination , such that for a larger one the bar is shorter .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath101 is not very easy to predict .",
    "for example , sometimes the m45 bar has the length equal to the one of m0 , but at other instances equal to the one of m90 .",
    "we note that at the end of simulations ( except for l0 ) the dwarfs should be regared as having elongated central parts , surrounded by spheroidal envelope , rather than as a disc with a bar component .",

    "the corotation radius @xmath7 is defined as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the circular velocity of the galaxy .",
    "a careful analysis of possible orbits in bars by @xcite showed that bars must follow the relation @xmath107 ( i.e. @xmath108 ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite , who used forcings of different extents but found that bars were always shorter than the corotation radius .",
    "this limit to the bar length can be illustrated by a following simplified reasoning .",
    "most of the stellar particles in the bar are on prograde orbits ( i.e. they orbit around the dwarf center faster than the bar rotates ) . however , the velocity of the particles at apocenters can not be larger than the circular velocity .",
    "the pattern speed of the bar is the same at every radius , hence the bar must end before circular angular speed drops below it , meaning that we expect @xmath107 .",

    "conversely , bars for which @xmath110 are called _",
    "slow_. in general , @xmath0-body simulations indicate that bars formed in isolation tend to be fast and indeed have @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , this may depend to some extent on the choice of initial parameters as slow bars have also been shown to form in isolation @xcite .",
    "bars formed in interactions are rather slow ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "we analyzed in detail the rotation in the dwarfs .",
    "however , we present it in terms of the rotation velocity instead of angular speed , because this way highlights more features . in figure [ fig_cr ]",
    "we plotted the circular velocity @xmath111 , the true rotation velocity of the stellar component @xmath102 and the linear bar rotation velocity @xmath112 .",
    "we computed the circular velocity as @xmath113^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the gravitational constant , @xmath73 is the distance from the center and @xmath114 is the total mass ( both baryonic and dark ) closer to the dwarf s center than @xmath115 .",
    "we calculated @xmath102 by averaging particle velocities at a given distance .",
    "the bar length is also indicated in each panel .",
    "the much lower values of @xmath111 at the end of simulations are the effect of mass stripping , mainly of the dark matter component .",
    "the growth of @xmath102 in the outskirts , visible in some panels , is related to the transition to the tidal arms . in some cases ( e.g.  at the end of run s0 ) @xmath102 is larger than @xmath111 .",
    "this is not surprising , as particles located in that region are already stripped from the dwarf galaxy and their movement is governed by the potential of the host .",
    "the sizes of the dwarfs can be estimated from figure [ fig_density_maps ] and at the end of the simulations are smaller than @xmath45 kpc ( except l0 , which is larger ) .",
    "the particles already stripped from the dwarf can move with a significant relative velocity @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the initial rotation velocity curve was around @xmath116 km s@xmath98 , attained approximately @xmath45 kpc from the center .",
    "as already discussed ( see figure  [ fig_rotation ] ) , in all cases the dwarfs lost a significant fraction of rotation , especially in the outer parts , but also in the centers .",
    "the loss of rotation is caused of course by the tidal force and stripping .",
    "the shapes of @xmath117 are qualitatively similar for all our simulations , usually with a distinct maximum .",
    "interestingly , the measured bar lengths fall in the vicinity of these maxima",
    ". however , recall that measuring @xmath101 involves a free parameter , hence it may be only a coincidence .    the values of @xmath12 can be obtained by finding the intersection of @xmath118 and @xmath111 ( blue and green ) curves and comparing them to the bar length .",
    "we conclude that all our bars are slow , having values of @xmath12 from @xmath45 to @xmath119 and more .",
    "however , considering the true rotation velocity @xmath102 ( violet lines ) , we see that the bars are actually rotating quite fast compared to the rotation velocity of the stars . by similar argument as above , bars are limited by the _ true corotation _ ,",
    "i.e. the radius where the pattern speed is the same as the actual angular velocity of the stars .    out of the in - plane prograde dwarfs , the slowest ( in terms of @xmath12 ) is the bar in run l0 , which is caused by its short length .",
    "however , one has to remember that if we consider the periods after the first pericenters , this bar is actually _ the fastest _ in terms of @xmath92 . for the inclined dwarfs , @xmath12 drops with inclination , but here",
    "again m90 is the fastest in terms of the pattern speed .",
    "hence one has to be careful , since bars may be fast according to one definition and at the same time slow according to another ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the end of the simulations , in the two in - plane prograde dwarfs with small pericenters ( m0 and s0 ) the bars are very slow , as they are barely rotating .",
    "the dwarfs with inclined discs retained their pattern speed ( see figure  [ fig_omega_p ] ) and at the same time they lost rotation and a lot of mass , hence they are actually faster than at the second apocenter",
    ".       of the central parts of the dark matter haloes in simulations m0 and m90 ( see text ) as a function of time . here",
    "the reference frame is such that the initial angular momentum of the disc is along the @xmath93 axis .",
    "in such a frame , the orbital angular momentum of dwarf m0 is also along the @xmath93 axis , but in run m90 it is along the @xmath48 axis ( i.e. the dwarf orbits in the @xmath120 plane ) . ]    an important concept in the studies of barred galaxies is the angular momentum transfer .",
    "it is quite well established that in the case of simulations of isolated galaxies the bars emit angular momentum , which is absorbed by their dark matter haloes .",
    "this process enables bars to grow in the secular evolution phase .",
    "we intended to study this process in the case of our simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the stellar component loses a large fraction of its amount of angular momentum via tidal interactions with the host galaxy directly to the tidal tails , and this leads to the decrease of rotation in the whole disc .",
    "thus , any bar - related evolution of angular momentum was obscured by this process .",
    "we were , however , able to track the behavior of the angular momentum of the dark matter halo . to study this effect",
    ", we use a reference frame different from the one used previously . now the @xmath93 axis is placed along the initial axis of rotation of the disc and the axes are kept constant . in figure  [ fig_angular_momentum ]",
    "we show the time evolution of the specific angular momentum @xmath121 of the central parts of dark matter haloes in two examples , m0 and m90 . in the calculation",
    "we take into account all particles closer than @xmath45 kpc from the centers of the dwarfs .",
    "recall that in run m0 the dwarf was on the in - plane prograde orbit , hence the @xmath93 axis is also perpendicular to the initial orbital plane . in run",
    "m90 the disc was perpendicular to the orbital plane , so the @xmath93 axis lies _ in _ this plane .",
    "the axis perpendicular to the plane is denoted as @xmath48 .",
    "the angular momentum evolution in runs s0 and l0 is qualitatively similar to run m0 . in run",
    "m45 the disc is precessing significantly , making the relevant plot incomprehensible .",
    "the most prominent feature in both panels of figure [ fig_angular_momentum ] is the variation of angular momentum component along the axis of the orbital motion ( @xmath93 in run m0 and @xmath48 in run m90 ) .",
    "after the first pericenter both halos acquire negative ( i.e. retrograde ) angular momentum .",
    "this is a direct result of the preferential stripping of particles on prograde orbits , in contrast to the retrograde ones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the spikes appearing just after the pericenter passages are due to the disturbance by the tidal force . in run",
    "m90 we can observe small , but steady increase of the @xmath122 component , resulting from the angular momentum transfer . in the case of run m0 , such an increase in @xmath122 is buried under larger changes induced by tides .",
    "most of the angular momentum lost by the stellar component is not transferred to the dark matter halo of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "buckling instability is a common phase of bar evolution . in the case of bars formed in isolation",
    ", it usually takes place soon after the bar formation .",
    "the instability leads to a change in the velocity distribution of the galaxy .",

    "it has been argued ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that a critical parameter for the instability is the ratio of @xmath124 .    to check whether the dwarfs underwent buckling instability we investigated edge - on surface density maps . in runs m45 , m90 and l0",
    "we did not detect any significant vertical asymmetry at any time .",
    "on the other hand , dwarf m0 underwent buckling and in run s0 we also detected some weak traces of possible instability .",
    "traces of undergoing buckling in run m0 can be noticed in the @xmath50 measurement in figure  [ fig_shape ] , where it grows steadily between @xmath125 and @xmath36 gyr",
    ". moreover , @xmath78 grows at the same time .",
    "the occurrence of buckling in the simulations may be related to the strength of the individual bars .",
    "dwarf m0 had the strongest bar , with the highest level of velocity dispersion @xmath77 .",
    "the bar in run s0 was slightly weaker and in run l0 was significantly weaker , at least after the first pericenter passage .",
    "this relation between the thickening amplitude and bar strength is supported by the correlation in @xcite and the simulations of @xcite , among which a discernible boxy / peanut bulge is present only in the case of the most disturbed galaxy with the strongest bar . in the case of the inclined dwarfs ,",
    "buckling might have been inhibited by the vertical disturbance of the disc during the pericenter passages .",
    "one more reason why our bars did not experience strong buckling , might have been repeated pericenter passages .",
    "the dwarf galaxies were tidally shocked at each of them and the resulting disturbance might have reduced the buckling amplitude . moreover ,",
    "we can not rule out that in cases where we did not notice the instability it actually occurred but was too weak or too fast to be recognized .",
    "none of our dwarfs formed a  boxy / peanut bulge , which is usually associated with the buckling instability .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that about @xmath126 galaxies in their sample do not show signs of boxy / peanut structures .",
    "moreover , the fraction of galaxies hosting a  boxy / peanut bulge is lower for the less massive systems @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out the development of spiral arms in our simulations , provided the tidal force is not too strong . in run",
    "l0 we observe two sets of two - fold tightly wound spiral arms , both of which can be seen as distinct maxima in the relevant panel of figure  [ fig_a2_map ] .",
    "the first one is located at @xmath127 kpc and exists for a period of @xmath119-@xmath128 gyr .",
    "the second is located at @xmath129 kpc and persists between @xmath36-@xmath130 gyr .",
    "tightly wound spiral arms are also present in our run m90 ( @xmath131 kpc , @xmath132-@xmath125 gyr ) and are probably responsible for the weakening of the bar right after the second pericenter .",
    "the inner set of arms can be linked to the peculiar features of l0 run around @xmath36 gyr , such as peaks in the pattern speed ( figure  [ fig_omega_p ] ) and the bar length ( figure  [ fig_bar_length ] ) .",
    "judging from the surface density maps , at this time the spiral arms seem to wind up and weaken the bar .",
    "they detach from the bar ends and finally turn into a ring around the bar , which can be seen in figure  [ fig_density_maps ] .",
    "a similar structure can be also seen in some large spirals .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite for a  detailed study of tidally induced spiral arms , albeit in the context of normal - size galaxies orbiting in a galaxy cluster .",
    "angular momentum and its transfer play an important role in the development and evolution of bars , as concluded from works concerning bars formed through instability .",
    "however , in the case of tidally induced bars the angular momentum budget is different .",
    "the galaxies encounter perturbers one or more times and lose large amounts of angular momentum . moreover , their outer parts are heavily disturbed and stripped .",
    "bars in isolated galaxies grow by emission of the angular momentum from inside the corotation radius , which is absorbed by the halo and the outer part of the disc @xcite . in our simulations @xmath7",
    "is usually located in the outer part of the disk . in particular , after the first pericenter @xmath133 kpc , whereas initially @xmath100 of the disc mass is inside @xmath134 kpc and the radius of @xmath125 kpc encompasses @xmath135 of the disc mass . therefore , there was insufficient amount of disc mass to absorb the angular momentum .",
    "in addition , our disc is initially hot and stable against bar formation .",
    "@xcite found that the hotter the disc the slower the deceleration of the bar .",
    "in isolated galaxies , resonances of the dark matter halo can absorb angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , haloes in our simulations are heavily stripped at all radii and heavily perturbed . on the fiducial orbit , the size of the halo drops from @xmath128 kpc after the first pericenter to @xmath125 kpc at the end , as can be estimated from the break in the dark matter density profile ( see figure 1 in @xcite )",
    "moreover , the halos lose mass also from the inner parts . almost @xmath3 of the initial mass inside @xmath125 kpc is lost at the first pericenter and more than @xmath100 before the end of the simulation .",
    "in addition , we can imagine that the velocity distribution is perturbed , which may hamper angular momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the bars formed through rapid instability are usually fast , having @xmath109 ( i.e. @xmath136 ) , which means that their length almost fills the corotation radius .",
    "tidally induced bars however , are much slower and/or shorter .",
    "figure  [ fig_cr ] makes it easy to understand , at least in the case of dwarf galaxies and strong tidal forces . during the interaction ,",
    "the rotation velocity @xmath117 drops significantly , e.g. by a factor of 2 .",
    "hence , the bar can not rotate as fast as in the isolated case . if we consider the _ true corotation _",
    "( i.e. radius at which @xmath137 ) , then the bars appear to rotate almost as fast as possible , given their environment .",
    "we note that some bars formed in isolation may be slow ( @xcite ; gas - poor examples of @xcite ) , possibly due to the lack of gas ( including during the bar formation period ) , to a dominant dark matter halo , or when the corotation is outside the disc .",
    "we would like to note that very slow pattern speeds , with an @xmath12 ratio of the order of 3 , have been actually observed in at least one case of a real galaxy @xcite , while @xmath12 ratios of the order of 2 are fairly common ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , the bar lengths in our simulations fall close to the maximum of the rotation curve and we can not offer any explanation for this , it may be only an accident .",
    "however , it would be interesting to check how this relation looks in bars formed via instability and in less perturbed tidally induced bars .",
    "it might be possibly related to the results of @xcite .",
    "now we would like to put our work in perspective of earlier findings .",
    "first we are going to compare our bars to bars formed in isolation and then to other works on tidally induced bars .",
    "we would like to stress that the evolution of bars in our simulation is different than in the case of bars formed through instability . in the latter ,",
    "bars usually start growing soon after the beginning of the simulation , then they experience buckling instability and finally they continue growing in a secular fashion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . here",
    ", the initial model of the dwarf galaxy is constructed in such a way that it is stable against spontaneous bar formation , at least over the timescales considered here ( i.e. @xmath32 gyr ) .",
    "the bars develop during the first encounter with the host galaxy .",
    "later , however , they seem not to grow in a secular way , but rather keep their parameters constant between pericenter passages . usually , the repeated encounters with the host galaxy weaken the bars .",
    "the only exception is the l0 dwarf on the widest orbit , for which the tidal force is relatively weak .",
    "the profiles of the bar amplitude @xmath84 are also different with respect to bars formed in isolation . in the latter case",
    "there is usually only a wide peak in the center , followed by a drop to near zero in the outskirts ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tidally induced bars may exhibit many peaks in @xmath84 profiles .",
    "some of them correspond to tidally induced spiral arms , other result form shells of matter .",
    "finally , @xmath84 grows in the outskirts , indicating the transition from the main body of the galaxy to its tidal tails .",
    "@xcite analyzed a suite of simulations following a milky way - like galaxy orbiting in a galaxy cluster .",
    "their model of the progenitor galaxy was unstable to spontaneous bar formation , however , it needed a long time to start developing the bar on its own . in their simulations",
    "the apparent influence of the tidal force was much weaker than in our simulations , as can be judged from the @xmath84 enhancement at pericenter passages or the tidal radius estimates .",
    "consequently , the initially formed bars are weaker than in our simulations . however , later on they grow continually , both during subsequent pericenter passages and in the periods between them .",
    "the @xcite bars do experience buckling instability , leading to the formation of boxy / peanut shapes in edge - on views , contrary to our models .",
    "@xcite found a bar fraction of @xmath6 among early - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "this may seem at odds with our simulations , in which all of the dwarfs developed bars . however , there are various reasons why we do not observe @xmath138 bar fraction .",
    "firstly , presence of gas in real galaxies hampers bar formation @xcite .",
    "secondly , @xcite showed that in the case of galaxy clusters , dwarf galaxies need to plunge deep into the cluster core to be influenced significantly by the tidal forces .",
    "thirdly , bars in our simulations are weakened or even destroyed during the evolution .",
    "as can be inferred from figure [ fig_density_maps ] , some of the dwarfs may not be classified as barred at final stages of their evolution , especially in case of unfavourable orientation .",
    "last but not least , we should note that all our simulations have the same mass model .",
    "thus the fact that they all form bars can not be compared to the observed fraction of bars in dwarfs galaxies , whose mass models span a considerable parameter space .",
    "the purpose of this work was to study the formation and evolution of tidally induced bars in dwarf galaxies orbiting a milky way - like host .",
    "we constructed an @xmath0-body model of a dwarf galaxy and verified that in isolation it is stable against bar formation over the time ranges of relevance here . in order to induce bar formation",
    ", we put the dwarf galaxy on an elongated orbit around an @xmath0-body model of a galaxy resembling the milky way .",
    "we focus on two parameters governing the evolution : the size of the dwarf s orbit and its disc inclination with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "we conducted five simulations .",
    "three of them had an in - plane prograde orientation of the disk but varying orbit sizes .",
    "for the medium - sized orbit we performed two additional simulations with the dwarf s disc inclined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 with respect to the orbital plane .    in all cases , bars form during the first pericenter passage , however their properties and the subsequent evolution vary .",
    "the overall strongest bar was formed for the intermediate orbit and in - plane prograde disc orientation . on the tighter orbit",
    "the tidal force is stronger and the disc is disturbed excessively , inhibiting the formation of a strong bar . on the wider orbit",
    "the tidal forces are too weak , hence initially only a weak bar develops . in comparison to a in - plane prograde orbit , for the higher inclinations the bars are progressively weaker . in the retrograde case",
    ", @xcite found that no bar forms at all .",
    "the dependence on the disc orientation stems from the progressively weaker tidal force in the equatorial plane of the dwarf and the unfavorable orientation of the coriolis force .",
    "the bars formed in our simulations were slow ( @xmath139 ) , in contrast to the bars developed in isolation , which are typically classified as fast ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we found that this is caused by the loss of a huge fraction of the dwarf galaxy angular momentum during the pericenter passage , as initially proposed by @xcite .",
    "consequently , the stellar component of the dwarf was rotating much slower than the maximum allowed by the circular velocity .",
    "hence , the bars were rotating significantly slower than the maxima deduced from the comparison of their lengths to their circular velocity curves .",
    "the life of bars developed in isolation usually includes phases of buckling and secular evolution . here , even if a bar underwent buckling , it was only very weak .",
    "one possible reason is that the bars were weaker than in the isolated cases @xcite",
    ". we also did not observe noticeable secular evolution , which usually involves the bar growth and slowdown .",
    "the possible explanation is the combination of repeated tidal shocks and stripping , which hindered the angular momentum transfer .",
    "the bars were stable between pericenter passages and evolved mainly during them .",
    "except for the case of the widest orbit , during subsequent encounters with the host the bars were weakened and shortened .",
    "in addition , the in - plane prograde dwarfs on the tightest and the intermediate orbit quickly lost almost all of their rotation .",
    "the final states of those dwarfs consisted of an elongated central part , with some rotation possible , enshrouded in a more spheroidal envelope .",
    "such an evolution was envisaged by the tidal stirring scenario for the transformation of a disc into a spheroid @xcite . obviously , it is not the buckling which leads to this thickening , but rather tidal shocking .    the main concern regarding the applicability of this work to the dwarf galaxies e.g.  in the local group is whether the initial conditions of the simulations correspond to real systems prior to accretion into the neighborhood of a larger galaxy .",
    "dwarf galaxies observed far away from other galaxies often posses significant amount of rotating interstellar gas .",
    "however , it remains an open question if their stellar components have structures of rather thin discs rotating in an ordered fashion , as we assumed here .",
    "moreover , in reality the satellites are accreted from the cosmic web , whereas here we just placed the dwarfs at apocenters of their orbit and gave them appropriate speed to reach the desired pericenter .",
    "furthermore , we neglected entirely the gas component and performed fully collisionless simulations .",
    "we know that the collisional component impacts immensely the formation and evolution of bars in isolation @xcite and that in fact isolated dwarf galaxies contain a large gas fraction @xcite .",
    "although the gas is probably efficiently ram - pressure stripped by the hot halo of the host , it may remain in the dwarf long enough to significantly affect the evolution .",

    "this work was partially supported by the polish national science centre under grant 2013/10/a / st9/00023 .",
    "ea is partially supported by the cnes ( centre national dtudes spatiales , france ) .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to solve the following problem . at an initial time ,",
    "normalised vectors @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 point along bar principal axes , respectively , major , intermediate and minor .",
    "similarly , vectors @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 correspond to a later state of this galaxy , which we will hereafter refer to as the final state of the galaxy .",
    "we would like to give a proper definition of the angle @xmath146 by which the bar rotated around the minor axis and to calculate its value in terms of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 .      without loss of generality , we can choose a reference frame whose axes lie along principal axes of the bar at the initial time , i.e.  @xmath147 and so forth .",
    "in such a  frame , the final principal axes can be expressed as @xmath148 where @xmath149 stands for transposition , so the first object on the right - hand side should be understood as a matrix , whose rows are given by components of @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "similar expressions can be written for @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the transformation of @xmath152 set into @xmath153 can be described in terms of a matrix @xmath154 such that        let us introduce the following notation : @xmath156 will be a matrix , which is an operator rotating vectors about unit vector @xmath157 by angle @xmath158 in counter clockwise direction .",
    "elements of such a matrix can be found using the rodrigues rotation formula : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the identity matrix and @xmath161 is a following matrix @xmath162 matrix @xmath163 can be viewed as an active transformation , as we described above , but as well as a passive one .",
    "namely , it corresponds to a change of reference frame , such that the frame is rotated about @xmath157 by an angle @xmath164 . from construction",
    ", @xmath165 is an orthogonal matrix and its inverse equals to @xmath166 .",
    "we need to make an assumption regarding the trajectory of the bar minor axis .",
    "this is required because otherwise we would not be able to determine a `` zero - point '' of the bar rotation angle .",
    "in particular , if the path of @xmath167 was unrestricted and the bar was not rotating , it could have any orientation at the final time .",
    "we assume the simplest possibility , namely that the bar minor axis follows the shortest path between @xmath168 and @xmath151",
    ". it can be regarded as a good approximation , if the outputs from the simulations are dense enough .",
    "hence , the transformation for @xmath167 is following : @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "one natural possibility for the full transformation matrix is @xmath172 , i.e.  first we rotate about @xmath168 by @xmath146 and then about @xmath173 by @xmath74 .",
    "however , there is another possibility , namely @xmath174 , i.e.  first we rotate about @xmath173 by @xmath74 and then about @xmath151 by @xmath146 .",
    "it turns out they are equivalent , as can be seen considering an operation @xmath175 . it can be regarded as composition of ( i ) rotation of the reference frame by @xmath74 about @xmath173 , which sets the @xmath93-axis along @xmath151 ( ii ) rotation around new @xmath93-axis and ( iii ) rotation of the reference frame back to the original position .",
    "hence , it is obvious that in fact @xmath176 , from which follows that @xmath177 .",
    "it can be also checked through tedious , but straightforward calculation of the elements of the matrices .    using the above equality",
    ", we can think about the whole transformation as composed of infinitesimal rotations about @xmath173 , followed by rotation around the instantaneous @xmath93-axis , repeated until the final state is reached .",
    "hence , @xmath154 can be thought of as @xmath178 where @xmath179 .",
    "the general structure of the matrix @xmath172 is complicated , however combination of its elements takes a simple form @xmath180 moreover , @xmath181 .",
    "hence , the rotation angle @xmath146 can be obtained from the numerical representation of @xmath154 using @xmath182    let us now turn to the determination of @xmath154 from the initial and final orientation of the bar principal axes .",
    "combining the definitions in we get @xmath183 hence , the columns of @xmath154 are given by components of @xmath184 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we can further substitute the expression for @xmath184 from and similarly for @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "finally , @xmath185 from the above form one can easily read the appropriate components of @xmath154 , obtaining @xmath186 the orientation of the intermediate axis can be expressed using @xmath187 .",
    "thus , the above result can be rewritten as @xmath188      which can be easily understood and serves as a simple check for our considerations .",
    "we see that @xmath191 $ ] is an oriented angle , which is positive if the bar rotates counter clockwise around its minor axis and negative otherwise .",
