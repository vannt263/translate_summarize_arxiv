    "the weak galerkin ( wg ) finite element method refers to a general finite element technique for partial differential equations where differential operators are approximated as discrete distributions or discrete weak derivatives .",
    "the method was first introduced in @xcite for second order elliptic equations , and was later extended to other partial differential equations including the stokes equations @xcite and the biharmonic equation @xcite .",
    "the current research indicates that the concept of discrete weak differential operators offers a new paradigm in numerical methods for partial differential equations .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the idea of weak galerkin to the problem ( [ moment1])-([bc1 ] ) .",
    "in essence , this procedure shall introduce a discrete curl operator , which shall be combined with the discrete weak gradient as introduced in @xcite to yield a finite element scheme for the maxwell equations . in this wg method ,",
    "two types of weak functions are used : @xmath22 ^ 3\\times [ p_t(e)]^3 $ ] and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 inside of each element and @xmath26 and @xmath27 on the boundary of the element .",
    "error estimates of optimal order are established for the wg approximations in appropriate norms for the case of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "for the case of @xmath28 and @xmath32 , only numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the corresponding wg finite element scheme ; a theoretical study of this wg method is left to interested readers for an investigation .",
    "the use of weak functions and weak derivatives makes the wg method highly flexible on the construction of finite element functions on partitions with arbitrary polygons or polyhedrons .",
    "compared with the dg method in @xcite , our wg methods make use of additional variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 defined on the boundary of the elements .",
    "however , the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 defined on each element can be eliminated through a local process / computation , yielding a system of linear equations involving only the variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , the wg method has much less number of globally coupled unknowns than dg methods .",
    "in addition , the weak galerkin finite element method is parameter independent in its stability and convergence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : preliminaries ] , we introduce some basic notations . in section [ section : wg - wd ] , we discuss some discrete weak differential operators , particularly a discrete weak curl . section [ section : wgfem ] is devoted to a presentation of the weak galerkin finite element scheme for the problem ( [ w1])-([w2 ] ) . in section [ section : errorequation ] , we derive an error equation for the wg finite element approximation . in section [ section : l2projections ] , we introduce two types of @xmath1 projection operators and derive some estimates for them .",
