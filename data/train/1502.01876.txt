    "bell s theorem shows that the correlations exhibited by quantum mechanical systems go beyond what is achievable by any local realistic theory ( i.  e.  any local hidden variable model ) @xcite .",
    "this result has deep implications and still spurs several subfields of research @xcite . on the one hand , from a foundational perspective",
    ", it has been questioned what physical principle in nature could then be responsible for giving rise to precisely the particular set of correlations allowed by quantum mechanics . since it has been shown that this set is strictly smaller than what could be achieved by just imposing the no - signaling principle ( i.  e.  the impossibility of instantaneous propagation of information ) @xcite , several works have considered more restrictive physically - motivated axioms @xcite .",
    "although these approaches rule out several subsets of no - signaling correlations , no definite answer has yet been found as there still exist supra - quantum correlations compatible with these principles @xcite . on the other hand , from a more practical point of view and in the context of quantum information theory , it has been realized that quantum nonlocality can be regarded as a resource for device - independent quantum information processing ( diqip ) .",
    "the tasks that can be carried out in this way include key distribution for cryptography @xcite , randomness generation @xcite and dimensionality certification ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) .    in order to understand which physical principles constrain the set of quantum correlations and to elucidate what are the ultimate limitations behind diqip protocols , a fundamental question arises :",
    "can an efficient mathematical description of this set be found ?",
    "it turns out that this is a highly nontrivial question .",
    "so far , the only systematic and general form to bound this set is given by the npa hierarchy @xcite .",
    "this provides a hierarchy of semi - definite programs that approximate the quantum set from the outside .",
    "although this constitutes an extremely powerful tool , it has been mainly exploited numerically .",
    "thus , many properties of the quantum set remain unknown , since verifying general statements can not be usually approached by numerical means .",
    "it would be therefore desirable to have simple analytical conditions constraining the set of quantum correlations .",
    "these could be moreover used to exclude some general subsets of no - signaling correlations from the quantum set based on their analytical properties or to bound the maximal efficiency diqip tasks with a given structure can attain . the aim of this article is to fill this gap : i provide simple general analytical conditions any quantum behaviour should satisfy which rely on standard matrix analysis .",
    "although these conditions emerge from the first step of the npa hierarchy and are , therefore , only necessary , i will consider examples showing their strength and non - triviality .",
    "furthermore , i will provide several different applications of this result : a proof of the separation between the quantum set and extremal nonlocal no - signaling correlations ( a question recently raised in @xcite ) , a systematic way to obtain quantum bounds on arbitrary bell inequalities ( generalizing the recent result @xcite ) and the possibility to do robust self - testing of bipartite maximally entangled states by building bell inequalities that are maximally violated by them .",
    "we will consider the standard bipartite @xmath0 bell scenario @xcite in which two parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 that could have interacted in the past remain now uncommunicated .",
    "party @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) can freely choose questions from a finite alphabet @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "given any of these inputs @xmath5 and @xmath6 , each party can obtain an outcome @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where the output alphabets are also finite .",
    "the central object here , referred to as behaviour , is the joint conditional probability distribution of obtaining the outputs @xmath9 given the choice of inputs @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( for which we will use the shorthand @xmath12 ) .",
    "this list of @xmath13 numbers must fulfill @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , since communication among the parties is not possible during the choice of input and recording of the output , the marginal of each party must be independent of the other s action , @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the set of all behaviours satisfying these no - signalling conditions will be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "particular elements of this set are the @xmath23 different local deterministic behaviours ( ldbs ) @xmath24 in which for every party a unique output occurs with probability 1 for every choice of input .",
    "the convex hull of these behaviours gives rise to the local set @xmath25 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum set @xmath26 is given by all behaviours that can be obtained by performing measurements on bipartite quantum states of unrestricted dimension @xmath27 , i.  e.  @xmath28 for some projectors @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 equal the identity in each party s hilbert space @xmath17 .",
    "the crucial observation mentioned in the introduction is that @xmath32 .",
    "although @xmath33 is a convex set , it is in general very hard to decide from the definition whether a given behaviour is in @xmath33 or not . on the contrary , @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "are both convex polytopes with vertices given by the ldbs in the first case , to which we have to add some non - local vertices in the second case . following the standard notation , we will refer to these extremal non - local behaviours as popescu - rohrlich ( pr ) boxes .    in order to present our results",
    ", we will use some further notation .",
    "we will arrange every @xmath36 to form the @xmath37 real matrix @xmath38 where in the standard notation of quantum mechanics @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes the computational basis of @xmath41 and similarly for the other alphabet elements .",
    "thus , @xmath42 can be partitioned as a block matrix @xmath43 with blocks @xmath44 normalization imposes that the entries in each block add up to one while no - signaling that the sum of the elements in the same row ( column ) for blocks in the same row ( column ) is equal .",
    "we will furthermore consider different matrix norms .",
    "following the schatten p - norm notation , @xmath45 will be the trace norm ( i.  e.  the sum of all singular values ) while @xmath46 the spectral norm ( i.  e.  the maximal singular value ) .",
    "we are now in the position to state our main result .    in every @xmath0 scenario , if @xmath47 then @xmath48 .",
    "we will actually prove the following stronger result : for every @xmath47 and @xmath49 it must hold that @xmath50 the relevance of this result will be discussed later on . for the moment , let us simply point out that theorem 1 follows from it by noticing that @xmath51 where the maximization is over all isometries @xcite .    in order to prove that inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is true , we will show that the inequality holds @xmath52 , i.  e.  the first step of the npa hierarchy ( notice that @xmath53 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that theorem 1 can be proved without invoking this @xcite .",
    "however , we have chosen to present this proof because it furthermore clarifies the relative strength of the condition .",
    "behaviours in @xmath54 must fulfill @xcite that a @xmath55 real positive semidefinite matrix @xmath56 exists with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is a vector of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) with entries given by @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) in lexicographical order .",
    "and @xmath67 have to be fixed to zero .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "] thus , defining @xmath68 , for any given @xmath69 the maximum value of @xmath70 attainable in @xmath33 can not be larger than @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) a @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) matrix",
    "whose only nonzero entry is the @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) with value 1 .",
    "this is the primal form of a semi - definite program ( sdp ) @xcite with cost function @xmath80 and we will denote its solution by @xmath81 .",
    "the dual form of this sdp corresponds to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a @xmath84 real vector yielding the value @xmath85 . by duality , for any feasible @xmath83 ( i.  e.  satisfying the constraint above )",
    ", it must hold that @xmath86 .",
    "thus , to finish the proof it suffices to construct a feasible @xmath83 yielding the value @xmath87 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath90-dimensional vector with all entries equal to one . to see that it is feasible amounts to checking that @xmath91 this is indeed true because , since the upper left corner in strictly positive definite , by schur s complement condition @xcite this is equivalent to @xmath92 which is obviously true given that the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath93 is precisely @xmath94 .",
    "one of the appealing properties of theorem 1 and inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is that they have a very compact form .",
    "however , the reasoning used in this proof can be applied to obtain other stronger but more complicated conditions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath95 the matrix constructed using the same prescription as @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ pmatrix ] ) but with entries given by @xmath96 we will now prove that for any choice of matrix @xmath49 , @xmath97 should hold @xmath98 and , hence    in every @xmath0 scenario , if @xmath47 then @xmath99    this proof goes along similar lines as the previous one , so we will only sketch the details .",
    "the set @xmath54 is actually equivalent to the positive semidefiniteness of @xmath100 @xcite , that is , @xmath101where now @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath104 in @xmath33 can not be larger than the primal sdp @xmath105 with dual @xmath106 where the vectors @xmath107 have entries @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the same choice of @xmath83 as in the previous proof does the job .",
    "let us finish this section analyzing the strength of theorems 1 and 2 by considering a few examples .",
    "as mentioned before , our conditions are deduced from the definition of the first step of the npa hierarchy , @xmath54 .",
    "obviously then , the best we can expect from them is to separate this set from its complement in @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath110 , it is clear that there exist supra - quantum behaviours satisfying the conditions of theorems 1 and 2 ( i.  e.  they are necessary for a behaviour to be in @xmath33 but not sufficient ) .",
    "we have performed numerical explorations in the ( 2222 ) scenario that show that the gap between @xmath54 and the behaviours satisfying our conditions is small .",
    "theorem 2 only provides a slightly better approximation of @xmath54 than theorem 1 . a more detailed example",
    "can be found in figure 1 . to my knowledge , the only previous instance of analytical means to constrain @xmath33 is given by the results of @xcite ( which emerge from @xmath54 as well ) . however , the application of these techniques is not completely straightforward as they rely on some choice of data processing .",
    "still , the inequality emerging from this approach reproduces @xmath54 in the ( 2222 ) scenario .",
    "notwithstanding , figure 1 shows that our conditions give a much tighter restriction already in the ( 3322 ) example considered in @xcite .",
    "this is also apparent in the ( 2233 ) case , where the results presented in @xcite fail to completely reproduce @xmath54 for the isotropic behaviours obtained by mixtures of a fully random box and the pr box @xmath111 ( see eq .",
    "( [ pr2d ] ) below ) . on the contrary ,",
    "theorems 1 and 2 are tight in this case .",
    "thus , it is interesting to point out that while inequalities ( [ ineq1 ] ) and ( [ ineq2 ] ) depend on a proper choice of @xmath69 for each case , these examples indicate that theorems 1 and 2 , which are straightforward to apply in general , still provide remarkably strong conditions . to show further the usefulness of these results , in the remaining sections we provide several applications of them .    , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are two pr boxes and @xmath114 is the fully mixed behaviour .",
    "horizontal lines achieve the same value for the @xmath115 bell inequality ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "crosses : the boundary of @xmath34 and @xmath33 ( equal in this slice , @xmath116 ) . dashed line : the boundary of @xmath54 ( @xmath117 ) . solid line : the conditions of theorems 1 and 2 ( they are equivalent in this case , @xmath118 ) .",
    "dashed - dotted line : the inequality of @xcite with the sign binning data processing ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "a more clever data processing for this case only manages to lower this condition to @xmath120 @xcite . ]",
    "the previous examples already give a good idea of the strength of the conditions derived here . to analyze in full generality their non - triviality ,",
    "notice that , due to the convexity of the trace norm , @xmath121 must attain its maximum value in @xmath35 at the vertices of the polytope .",
    "hence , the ideal situation would be that the ldbs achieve the maximal possible value ( @xmath122 ) and that all pr boxes violate this bound .",
    "actually , it has been only recently shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that all pr boxes ( including the multipartite case ) are not in @xmath33 .",
    "it was left as an open question there whether there exists a separation between them and @xmath33 .",
    "the interest of this question relies on the fact that pr boxes are the most advantageous resources in diqip applications such as cryptography @xcite .",
    "thus , the closer @xmath33 can be to these behaviours the more efficient these applications can be . in the following",
    "we show that all ldbs attain the @xmath122 bound and that all pr boxes in @xmath123 and @xmath124 scenarios violate the bound .",
    "thus , besides showing that the bound is not improvable and in general not trivial , we further provide a simple proof in these cases of the result of @xcite .",
    "moreover , we show that there actually exists a quantitative separation between these pr boxes and @xmath33 , answering in these scenarios the question raised therein .    in every @xmath0 scenario , if @xmath125 then @xmath48 , with equality for ldbs .",
    "every ldb is of the form @xmath126 where the lists @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) have @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) entries equal to 1 and 0 otherwise .",
    "hence , @xmath131 notice that the fact that @xmath48 holds @xmath132 follows then by the convexity of the trace norm without the need of invoking theorem 1 .    evidently , that the inequality is fulfilled in @xmath34 was already obvious from theorem 1 .",
    "the important observation here is that all ldbs attain the bound , hence showing that it can not be improved .",
    "we analyze now the values @xmath121 might take for pr boxes .",
    "let us consider first the @xmath123 scenario .",
    "taking @xmath133 to be the circulant @xmath134 matrix @xmath135 the pr boxes in this case are given by @xmath136 up to relabelings of the inputs and the outputs @xcite .",
    "since these transformations amount to certain permutations of the rows or columns of @xmath42 that leave the trace norm invariant , it suffices to compute it for the matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ pr2d ] ) . using the pinching inequality @xcite",
    ", we obtain that @xmath137the conditions under which equality is attained in the pinching inequality are given in theorem 8.7 of @xcite and it is easily checked that they are not met in this case .",
    "hence , we obtain that @xmath138 , which amounts to the non - quantumness of these pr boxes by theorem 1",
    ". moreover , by a more refined use of the pinching inequality , we obtain the following stronger result , which shows the existence of a finite gap between these pr boxes and @xmath33 .    in every @xmath123 scenario , it holds @xmath98 that @xmath139 @xmath140 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath141 @xmath139 . by permutation matrices , that leave the trace norm invariant , we can map @xmath142 to @xmath143 , which has now blocks given by @xmath144 we therefore have that @xmath145 where @xmath146 hence",
    ", using now the pinching inequality we obtain the desired result @xmath147 .",
    "it might be interesting to note that @xmath148 . to see this ,",
    "notice that for the frobenius norm @xmath149 and that @xmath150 for any @xmath151 matrix @xmath152 .",
    "numerics suggest that the above estimates can be improved to @xmath153 , that would change the bound in theorem 4 to @xmath154 .",
    "let us move now to the @xmath124 scenario .",
    "the corresponding pr boxes have all been determined in @xcite ( see table ii therein ) .",
    "we denote an arbitrary one of them by @xmath155 .",
    "one sees that ( up to relabelings ) these matrices always have the following structure : they have a @xmath156 block in the diagonal given by @xmath157 followed by @xmath158 @xmath159 blocks in the diagonal , which are either @xmath160 , @xmath161 or @xmath162 .",
    "since the latter blocks all have unit trace norm , it follows again by the pinching inequality that @xmath163 .",
    "this shows again by virtue of theorem 1 that there is a quantitative separation between the pr boxes in these scenarios and @xmath33 :    in every @xmath124 scenario , it holds @xmath98 that @xmath164 .",
    "it might be interesting to mention as well that in the @xmath124 scenario for the fully nondeterministic boxes it holds that @xmath165 .",
    "for these behaviours there are @xmath166 non - vanishing entries with value @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "hence , similarly as before , @xmath168 , obtaining the above estimate .",
    "one can see that the left - hand - side of inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) defines an arbitrary bell expression , i.  e.  any linear combination of the elements @xmath11 . since @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 are compact convex sets , there always exist such expressions separating them , i.  e.  @xmath169 depending on whether @xmath170 with @xmath171 .",
    "the most characteristic one is the chsh inequality ( see below ) in the @xmath172 scenario for which @xmath173 @xcite , @xmath174 @xcite and @xmath175 @xcite . while to determine the optimal value of @xmath176 and @xmath177 it suffices to check over the corresponding vertices , to determine the optimal value of @xmath178 , known as tsirelson bounds , is a less straightforward task . and @xmath177 can be computationally hard as the number of vertices increases exponentially with the number of inputs .",
    "] however , this is very relevant to identify optimal diqip performances in the context of quantum games @xcite .",
    "thus , a remarkable feature of inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is that it provides a systematic way to construct quantum upper bounds to arbitrary bell inequalities .",
    "actually , our result resembles that of @xcite , but the latter only holds for the particular class of bell inequalities based on correlators .",
    "later on , we will discuss this relation further . to give a hint of the usefulness of inequality ( [ ineq1 ] )",
    ", we will show now that it allows to obtain tsirelson s bound for the chsh inequality .",
    "this can be expressed by a matrix @xmath179 with blocks @xmath180 it turns out that @xmath181 and , hence , we obtain the trivial bound 4 .",
    "nevertheless , given that behaviours in @xmath35 must fulfill several different constraints , equivalent bell inequalities can be expressed up to rescaling and addition of an offset .",
    "thus , if we take ( @xmath182 is a matrix with all entries equal to 1 ) @xmath183 it holds that @xmath184 @xmath185 . since @xmath186",
    ", we have then that @xmath98 , @xmath187 and , hence , @xmath188 .",
    "since the chsh tsirelson bound is achievable by a quantum behaviour arising from certain measurements on a maximally entangled two - qubit state and @xmath189 is orthogonal , this also shows that for this behaviour @xmath190 , achieving the bound of theorem 1 .",
    "it is a natural question to ask which other behaviours in @xmath191 can attain it .",
    "we computed @xmath121 for the quantum behaviours yielding the largest known value for several two - outcome bell inequalities given in @xcite but , in general , the bound of theorem 1 is not attained . interestingly , when this occurs , the behaviour arises from a maximally entangled state of qubits .",
    "this seems to extend for scenarios with more outcomes . in particular , in ( 2233 ) the quantum behaviour maximally violating the cglmp inequality @xcite was given in @xcite .",
    "however , for it we find that @xmath192 , while the maximal value @xmath190 is attained for the behaviour that yields the maximal cglmp value when restricted to a maximally entangled two - qutrit state @xcite .",
    "this leads to consider whether for every bipartite maximally entangled state of dimension @xmath193 , latexmath:[\\[\\label{maxent }    exists measurements such that the corresponding behaviour attains the bound of theorem 1 . in the following we show that this is indeed the case @xmath139",
    ". we will use the construction of @xcite that provides measurements on a @xmath195 scenario ( i.  e.  @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) such that acting on @xmath198 lead to the behaviour @xmath199\\right)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "this construction is enough to show that for a maximally entangled state of any dimension , there exist a behaviour for which the bound of theorem 1 can be saturated .",
    "however , it should be stressed that other behaviours arising from maximally entangled states can have this property as well .    for any",
    "maximally entangled state @xmath198 , the corresponding @xmath195 behaviour given in eq .",

    "to that aim we will first show that @xmath208 is normal ( i.  e.  @xmath209 ) implying that the singular values correspond to the absolute values of the eigenvalues . by fixing the inputs @xmath210 , the matrix of the behaviour ( [ maxentbeh ] )",
    "can be partitioned as @xmath211 where @xmath212\\right)^{-1},\\nonumber\\\\ p(ab|12)&=\\left(2d^3\\sin^2\\left[\\pi(a - b-1/4)/d\\right]\\right)^{-1},\\nonumber\\\\ p(ab|12)&=\\left(2d^3\\sin^2\\left[\\pi(a - b+3/4)/d\\right]\\right)^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , to ease the notation we will rewrite eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) as @xmath213 notice that the @xmath134 matrices @xmath214 are circulant , as for every fixed @xmath210 it holds that @xmath215 where it should be understood here that @xmath216 .",
    "we will use the following properties of @xmath134 circulant matrices @xcite : they all have the same eigenvectors @xmath217 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath218 where @xmath219 are the @xmath193-th roots of unity .",
    "this particularly implies that all circulant matrices are normal and commute with each other .",
    "hence , it is easy to check that @xmath208 is normal if @xmath220 . to see that this is indeed the case , consider that eq .",
    "( [ eign ] ) tells us that the eigenvalues of our matrices are given by @xmath221 these summation formulas are computed in the appendix , obtaining @xmath222 notice then that @xmath223 corresponding to the same eigenvector , which in addition to the fact that these matrices are normal , implies indeed that @xmath220 . hence , @xmath208 is normal and , therefore , its singular values are the absolute value of its eigenvalues .",
    "we compute now then the latter .",
    "since all circulant matrices are diagonalized by the same unitary @xmath224 ( i.  e.  @xmath225 with @xmath226 diagonal for every circulant matrix @xmath152 ) , it holds then that the matrix @xmath227 has the same eigenvalues as @xmath208 .",
    "using now the schur complement condition that tells us that @xmath228 we have that @xmath229 and , hence , @xmath230 thus , using eqs .",
    "( [ eigs ] ) , we obtain that @xmath231 which means that @xmath232 hence , we finally obtain that @xmath233    this result is interesting because it shows that the bound of theorem 1 is attainable in @xmath191 and that behaviours arising from maximally entangled states are extremal in this sense .",
    "notwithstanding , it has some further application .",
    "if a real square matrix @xmath42 has singular value decomposition given by @xmath234 then @xmath235 with @xmath236 orthogonal ( as so are @xmath224 and @xmath237 ) .",
    "thus , by choosing @xmath238 , we can always construct a bell expression such that for any given @xmath12 it holds that @xmath239 .",
    "remarkably , if we happen to have a quantum behaviour such that @xmath240 ( i.  e.  it saturates the bound of theorem 1 ) , then the aforementioned prescription immediately yields a bell expression which is maximized in @xmath33 by @xmath42 .",
    "this is because @xmath241 and , hence , by inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) , there can not exist any other quantum behaviour @xmath242 such that @xmath243 .",
    "thus , this allows to construct bell inequalities which are maximally violated in @xmath33 by different behaviours of interest .",
    "theorem 6 shows that this is possible for maximally entangled states of any dimension @xcite .",
    "for example , following this prescription for the behaviour ( [ maxentbeh ] ) with @xmath244 leads to a bell expression @xmath245 which is then maximized in @xmath33 by @xmath246 and is given by the following coefficient matrix .",
    "hence , @xmath224 and @xmath237 are not orthogonal ( they are not square ) and nor is @xmath69 . still , it holds that @xmath247 as @xmath241 . ] @xmath248 notice that this bell inequality separates @xmath34 from @xmath33 as it is straightforward to find that the maximal value of @xmath245 under @xmath34 is @xmath249 .",
    "a different example of a bell inequality maximally violated by @xmath246 can be found in @xcite .",
    "thus , theorem 6 also shows that that for a maximally entangled state of any dimension there always exists a bell inequality that is maximally violated in @xmath33 by it and how to construct it @xcite . in this sense , one can then devise a diqip protocol for which maximally entangled states are optimal within @xmath33 .",
    "this might also be of relevance in the context of self - testing @xcite if it turned out that the behaviour ( [ maxentbeh ] ) is the only one maximizing these bell expressions in @xmath33 .",
    "self - testing arises when a certain behaviour is the unique to attain a particular bell value .",
    "this allows to check the performance of a quantum set - up without trusting any of the devices , particularly when it can be made robust @xcite . using the techniques of @xcite with the bell inequality @xmath245 and its generalizations for other dimensions , it could be possible to check whether robust self - testing of maximally entangled states is possible in this way .",
    "notice , moreover , that this observation above that allows to construct a bell expression such that @xmath239 can be used in other contexts .",
    "for instance , the results of theorems 4 and 5 imply that for every pr box considered there we can write down constructively a bell expression , and hence a potential diqip protocol , whose performance has a quantitative gap with any quantum behaviour .",
    "if we restrict ourselves ourselves to two - outcome scenarios ( @xmath250 ) and taking @xmath251 , all behaviours in @xmath35 can be alternatively characterized by the correlators @xmath252 and the marginal expectations @xmath253 as mentioned before , it has been shown in @xcite that for the particular class of correlator bell inequalities , @xmath254 must hold @xmath98 and every real @xmath255 matrix @xmath69",
    ". we will denote by @xmath256 the @xmath255 matrix with entries @xmath257 .",
    "it can be shown that the result above can also be proved using similar techniques as in theorems 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "for that , one just needs to consider that behaviours in @xmath54 must fulfill @xcite that a @xmath258 real positive semidefinite matrix @xmath259 exists with @xmath260 and @xmath261 and proceed as in the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 to upper bound @xmath262 .",
    "this does not only provide an alternative proof of inequality ( [ eqepping ] ) but it also shows that this bound can not give stronger constraints than @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , as in theorems 1 and 2 this leads to the following condition latexmath:[\\[\\label{ineqc1 }    that this condition is strictly weaker than theorem 1 ( i.  e.  every behaviour detected as non - quantum by the above inequality is also non - quantum by theorem 1 ) as we show in the following .",
    "for every two - outcome behaviour @xmath36 , if @xmath264 , then @xmath265 .",
    "using again the mapping from @xmath42 to @xmath266 as in the proof of theorem 4 , we obtain that @xmath267\\nonumber\\\\                                    & = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_am_b}+||c||_1}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inequality comes from corollary 3 in @xcite .",
    "the above result agrees with intuition since with @xmath256 we are not fully characterizing @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests to consider on the analogy of theorem 2 a condition including the marginals @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "indeed , using similar arguments based on the first step of the npa hierarchy one can show that , for every matrix @xmath270 , it must hold for every quantum behaviour that @xmath271 this particularly implies the following .",
    "for every two - outcome behaviour @xmath47 it holds that @xmath272 where @xmath273 has entries @xmath274 .",
    "we have to show that inequality ( [ ineqc2 ] ) is true for quantum behaviours .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath54 is equivalent @xcite to the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath275 where @xmath276 ( @xmath277 ) is an @xmath129(@xmath130)-dimensional vector with entries @xmath268 ( @xmath269 ) . by schur",
    "s complement condition this leads to @xmath278 with @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "proceeding as in the proof of theorems 1 and 2 we can upper bound @xmath281 to obtain the desired result .",
    "we have shown that the first step of the npa hierarchy allows to obtain simple analytical conditions constraining the set of quantum behaviours in general bipartite bell scenarios , whose strength and non - triviality have been illustrated .",
    "since not all problems in quantum nonlocality and diqip can be addressed numerically , we expect these conditions to be of utility , filling the hitherto lack of such general tools .",
    "in fact , we have applied these conditions here to obtain a variety of results . in sec .",
    "[ nontsec ] we have shown that our bounds are tight and , in general , non - trivial , and we have used them to prove that there exists a finite gap ( whose size we have estimated ) between the quantum set and pr boxes in several general scenarios answering a question raised in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ tsisec ] we have provided a systematic construction of quantum bounds for arbitrary bell inequalities and we have shown that for a maximally entangled state of any dimension one can obtain a behaviour that attains the bound of theorem 1 .",
    "interestingly , this can be translated into a bell inequality whose tsirelson bound is reached by such a state .",
    "this could be applied for robust self - testing of maximally entangled states using the techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ corrsec ] we studied the particular case of correlation scenarios and established some links with the results of @xcite .",
    "several other ideas will be further investigated in the future . given a bell inequality ,",
    "it would be interesting to find a procedure to find the best form of @xmath69 in ( [ ineq1 ] ) to obtain its quantum upper bound and when it can be optimal .",
    "it is also worth further research to characterize which behaviours in @xmath191 attain the bound in theorem 1 : do they only arise from maximally entangled states ?",
    "it would be also desirable to extend this approach to the multipartite setting .",
    "last , it is worth studying whether stronger analytical conditions as those derived here can be obtained by considering further steps of the npa hierarchy .",
    "i thank a. acin and his collaborators for sharing with me a draft of their work on bell inequalities maximally violated by maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "this research was funded by the spanish mineco through grants mtm 2010 - 21186-c02 - 02 , mtm2011 - 26912 and mtm2014 - 54692 and the cam regional research consortium quitemad+cm s2013/ice-2801 .",
    "here we prove the summation formulas used in the proof of theorem 6 : @xmath282 which follow from @xmath283 to verify eq .",
    "( [ eqapp ] ) , first notice that the geometric sum yields @xmath284 and , therefore , @xmath285 thus , we find that @xmath286 notice that the inner sum is equal to zero , unless @xmath287 for any integer @xmath288 for which the sum is equal to @xmath193 .",
