    "we also point out that nco accretion can account for the soft x - ray excess observed in seyfert agn and the inflation of the accretion flow at large radii even when radiation pressure from the central engine is very low .",

    "mass segregation may play a role in determining the nco population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we should expect @xmath6 ncos of average mass @xmath7 within 1pc of a sgra * black hole . in a given nucleus , the exact proportion of stellar and compact ncos will depend on the history of the nucleus host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if a large quantity of gas arrives in the innermost pc of a galactic nucleus , it will likely lose angular momentum and accrete onto the central supermassive black hole , but in doing so must also interact with the nco population . depending on the aspect ratio of the disk that forms ,",
    "a few percent of ncos orbits are likely to coincide with the accretion flow .",
    "a small percentage of ncos coincident with the disk could lead to few@xmath8 ncos in the accretion flow around a sgra * black hole . while multi - object migration in disks is an open problem beyond the scope of this letter , the existence of _ one",
    "_ migrator can have important consequences for the observational appearance of galactic nuclei .",
    "given the number of ncos available , it is probable that the effects described below are important in many agn disks .    by analogy with protoplanetary disk theory , and following e.g. @xcite",
    ", we assume that ncos in thin agn disks exchange angular momentum with disk gas and migrate .",
    "this assumption is not unreasonable since the mass ratios involved , disk densities and related physics ( gravitational instability and magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) ) are similar for agn and protoplanetary disks at large radii , although temperatures differ substantially at small radii .",
    "agn disks at small radii are relativistic ( both special and general ) . however , fully general relativistic global mhd disks appear globally similar to their newtonian counterparts until close to the radius of last stable orbit ( @xmath9 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . likewise , self - gravity in agn accretion disks will be important ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , disk self - gravity does not appear to have a major effect on the torques involved in satellite migration , except possibly accelerating migration outwards @xcite .",
    "obviously , simulations are required to understand the parallel with agn disks in detail and we will return to this in future work .",
    "the aspect of protoplanetary disk theory that most concerns us here is that dense satellites perturb disk symmetry , suffer a net torque and exchange angular momentum with disk gas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "even where the disk is self - gravitating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ionized enough to maintain mri ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the torque can operate very effectively in exchanging angular momentum between the satellite and the gas . as a result",
    ", the satellite can migrate within the gas disk , sometimes very rapidly indeed . in classical protoplanetary disk theory ,",
    "type i migration ( small migrator , @xmath10 ) occurs on a timescale of @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the central mass , @xmath13 is the ratio of the satellite mass to the central mass , @xmath14 is the disk surface density , @xmath15 is the disk aspect ratio and @xmath16 is the satellite angular frequency .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath17 depends on the ratio of radiative to dynamical timescales and is a function of the power - law indices of @xmath18 and entropy @xcite .",
    "larger ( type ii ) migrators ( @xmath19 ) can open gaps in the disk and migrate inwards on the viscous accretion timescale of the disk , @xmath20 , ( i.e. @xmath21 ) .",
    "an intermediate form of migration ( type iii ) can occur where the migrator ( @xmath22 ) perturbs the disk , but not enough to open a gap ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this form of migration can occur very quickly in either direction and may in fact runaway outwards depending on the flow of gas around the migrator @xcite .",
    "type iii migration occurs on approximately the dynamical ( orbital ) timescale of the disk ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "accretion onto the central black hole in agn occurs via the transfer of angular momentum between parcels of gas in a disk .",
    "a mass of gas moving inwards ( @xmath24 ) in the disk will drive a mass of gas outwards ( @xmath25 ) , conserving angular momentum so that @xmath26 for a keplerian disk . in the case of the classic stationary thin disk ,",
    "the mass flux through the disk around a schwarzschild black hole ( and inferred accretion rate ) is given by @xcite @xmath27}=\\frac{\\delta m}{\\delta t } \\label{eq : shakura}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath29 is the sound speed and @xmath30 is the viscous timescale of the disk , given by @xmath31 .",
    "friction in the viscous disk generates luminosity which is parameterized as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the efficiency of gravitational energy release ( @xmath34 for a schwarzschild metric @xcite up to @xmath35 for a maximally spinning kerr black hole ) for a standard thin disk .",
    "heat release per unit disk area for a thin disk in a keplerian potential is @xmath36 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "now , if we substitute the outflowing gas parcel ( @xmath25 ) above with an out - migrating nco of identical mass , @xmath24 will be identical , but the inflow timescale will now be the nco migration timescale ( @xmath37 ) rather than the viscous disk timescale ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the disk luminosity and heating generated by the inflow is still produced by the same underlying microphysics ( i.e. gas friction in the disk ) .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath30 in equation  [ eq : shakura ] is now the migration timescale . if @xmath38 then @xmath39 due to migration can dominate viscous accretion .",
    "figure  [ fig : dt ] shows the relevant timescales as a function of radius , using a thin accretion disk surrounding a @xmath40 supermassive black hole with @xmath39 constant ( at 0.5 eddington ) as a function of radius @xcite .",

    "this condition corresponds to @xmath49 where @xmath14 is the disk surface density , @xmath50 is the distance of the nco from the supermassive black hole , @xmath51 is the width of the co - rotating gas region ( roughly the hill sphere radius ) and @xmath52 is the mass of the nco .",

    "the dash - dot line represents a @xmath44 nco undergoing type i migration and doubling its radius on the type i migration timescale .",
    "we note several important points from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] .",
    "first , the runaway migration of a _ single _ @xmath67 nco near @xmath71 can generate the eddington mass accretion rate in an agn , corresponding to quasar - like luminosity .",
    "based on the environment of sgra * , up to a few@xmath72 ncos could lie within 1pc of the @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] , leading to a large nco population in the accretion disk .",
    "second , since runaway migration is greatest for large disk surface density @xcite , runaway nco migration is most likely to occur deeper in the agn potential where it can generate very high @xmath39 .",
    "third , if the speed or magnitude of runaway migration is greater for ncos in agn disks than in @xcite , @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] could be substantially higher .",
    "the local disk heating ( @xmath36 ) associated with runaway migration within a few thousand @xmath73 exceeds local viscous heating for seyfert agn ( @xmath74 ) by a factor of a few .",
    "if @xmath39 due to viscous accretion drops with radius , local heating due to migration at large radii ( @xmath36 ) could dominate viscous heating , particularly since the nco population should increase as the radius squared .",
    "note that , if the nco migrates _ inwards _ rather than outwards , the type iii and type i migration curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] will be lower by a factor of @xmath75 since @xmath76 for a keplerian disk .",
    "interestingly , an nco that is not tidally disrupted while accreted onto the black hole should correspond to a low luminosity ( @xmath32 ) mode of accretion .",
    "the very large initial number of ncos expected in the agn disk should lead to a rapid clearing out of ncos due to three - body interactions .",
    "naively we might expect roughly half the cleared out ncos to be ejected from the disk and half to be accreted onto the supermassive black hole .",
    "the clearout duration ( @xmath77 ) could constitute a very high accretion rate ( @xmath78 ) onto the supermassive black hole . if the clearout occurs e.g. on the average dynamical timescale at @xmath79 ( @xmath80myr ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] , for @xmath6 ncos in the disk surrounding a @xmath40 black hole , the nco accretion rate is @xmath81 for @xmath80myr .",
    "compact ncos are less effected by tidal shearing and so may represent the most radiatively inefficient mode of accretion while tidally disrupted stellar ncos will contribute to the agn luminosity ( @xmath32 ) during this phase . after clearing out , a small population of migrators should be left in the thin agn disk .",
    "however , gradual orbital decay of ncos intersecting the disk must occur over time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "phenomena such as resonant relaxation @xcite and the kozai mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will contribute to nco capture by the disk , although on timescales longer than the agn disk lifetime ( @xmath82myrs ) in most cases .",
    "the capture rate for ncos on small radius orbits is the dominant effect over the agn lifetime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so @xmath83 ncos could be added to the disk in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] within @xmath84 over a @xmath70myr disk lifetime .",
    "ncos can have very different appearances depending on their accretion rates from the disk .",
    "the most massive stellar ncos , accreting rapidly from the disk , can become luminous blue , wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "minor black holes accreting rapidly can look like high mass x - ray binaries or ulxs depending on @xmath85 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "neutron stars accreting at a high rate can spin up rapidly becoming pulsars , contributing to ( quasi ) periodic signals in the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "accreting white dwarfs will heat up and contribute to the overall ir flux and generate type ia supernovae . if the mass of the accreting nco approaches @xmath86 , the nco may begin to migrate very rapidly in the disk ( see above ) . for ncos not in the disk , sporadic accretion will occur onto compact ncos punching through the disk on orbits on small fractions of their orbital timescales , contributing to observed volume filling broad - line and narrow - line emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite point out that a stellar mass black hole accreting from a dense gas disk can accrete at near eddington rates(@xmath81 ) .",
    "by contrast , strong magnetic fields may inhibit accretion onto neutron stars and white dwarfs @xcite . for a population of @xmath87 ncos in the disk around a sgra * black hole , with fiducial compact nco population of @xcite : @xmath88(black holes , accreting at @xmath81 ) , and @xmath89(neutron stars ) and @xmath90(white dwarfs ) accreting at @xmath91 ,",
    "the total compact nco luminosity contribution corresponds to @xmath92 of the central supermassive black hole .",
    "therefore , accretion onto compact ncos could dominate viscous disk accretion in lower luminosity agn and liners ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a single 10@xmath58 black hole accreting at @xmath93 located @xmath94pc from a @xmath95 erg / s agn ionizing continuum will dominate the local ionization field within @xmath96pc .",
    "a population of @xmath68 such nco accretors distributed around @xmath94pc would dominate low luminosity agn heating of the outskirts of the disk .",
    "a soft x - ray bump ( the soft excess ) of @xmath97 erg @xmath98 and uncertain origin is observed in many seyfert agn , with constant temperature over four orders of magnitude in black hole mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitude and constant temperature of the soft excess could be explained either by @xmath1 stellar mass black holes accreting like galactic high - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by a handful of ulxs @xcite .",
    "if there is a correlation between the soft excess and powerlaw luminosities @xcite , there may be a link between nco accretion rate and accretion onto the supermassive black hole .",
    "intrinsic soft excess variability will depend on the number of nco accretors . in the limit of a single highly luminous ulx with mass ratio @xmath13",
    ", the soft excess will vary on timescales @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the timescale of variation of the powerlaw component . in the limit of a large number of accreting ncos",
    ", the _ magnitude _ of the intrinsic soft excess luminosity variability will be much smaller than powerlaw variability .",
    "the heat liberated by migration ( @xmath36 ) drops quickly with increasing radius . unless the migration is rapid ( large @xmath39 ) , heating due to nco accretion should dominate at large radii , since the number of ncos should grow as the square of the radius . a large enough number of accreting compact objects ( black holes and neutron stars ) can generate sufficient hard radiation / radiation pressure to inflate the accretion flow at large radii , _ regardless of the rate of accretion onto the supermassive black hole _ , so we should expect inflated accretion flows in even low luminosity galactic nuclei .",
    "the type i migration timescale should increase as @xmath101 , so migration should become inhibited at large radii , unless ncos accrete enough so that @xmath102 and rapid type iii migration can occur .",
    "a cluster of stars and compact objects is expected in the central pc of most galactic nuclei .",
    "the exchange of angular momentum between an accretion disk of gas and nuclear cluster objects ( ncos ) can lead to nco migration and nco accretion . here",
    "we emphasize that runaway outward migration of ncos in agn disks , similar to type iii migration in protoplanetary disks , generates accretion rates that can dominate traditional viscous disk accretion rates .",
    "disk heating due to nco migration / accretion can inflate the accretion flow and counter the gravitational instability at large radii .",
    "inflation of the accretion flow due to compact objects in the disk may account for obscuring structures in liners and low luminosity agn .",
    "a small population of accreting stellar mass black holes can account for the magnitude and constant temperature of the soft x - ray excess observed in seyfert agn .",
    "we also note some important implications for future work : 1 ) a large population of migrating ncos in a gas disk could help close the final parsec gap in stalled supermassive black hole binary mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by exchanging angular momentum with the smbh .",
    "2 ) nco clear - out from agn disks may yield a population of high velocity ns and wd in galactic bulges and haloes , together with high velocity stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "high velocity pulsars in our own galaxy have velocities similar to escape speeds from around sgr a * ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) differences between nco populations in different nuclei could account for observed differences in agn in spiral and elliptical hosts .",
    "4 ) imbhs build up mass most efficiently as ncos in an agn disk and ulx signatures should be observed in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "5 ) radiatively inefficient , thick ( @xmath103 ) disks may drive more out - migration than thin - disks .",
    "6 ) nco migration in a disk threaded with magnetic fields can drive mhd outflows .",
    "we conclude that realistic models of agn disks should include populations of migrating and accreting ncos .",
