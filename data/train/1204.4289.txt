    "the sky brightness is a critical parameter for judging a potential site for direct coronal observation . at an excellent coronagraph site",
    ", its normalized sky brightness at noon time is usually around ten millionths of the solar disk center intensity so that it is possible for coronal emission to be reliably detected @xcite .",
    "a couple of years ago scientists in chinese solar physics society had reached a common understanding that they would find an excellent solar observation site in western china before developing their next - generation large - aperture solar telescope , the chinese giant solar telescope ( cgst ; ) .",
    "based on the experience of the advanced technology solar telescope ( atst ; ) site survey , they decided to adopt a sky brightness monitor ( sbm ) as one of the necessary tools to precisely measure the sun s nearby sky brightness and to provide with information on the precipitable water vapor content in the atmosphere .",
    "it should be noted that before the sbm was designed by the atst site survey team , the traditional visual evans sky photometer had been used for a long time since 1940 s @xcite .",
    "the sbm is actually a coronagraph instrument that is able to supply quasi - instantaneous , multi - wavelength , two - dimensional data with an automatic tracking system and a ccd system , much more objective , flexible , and powerful than the evans sky photometer .    in january 2010",
    "the first cgst sbm was finished in yunnan and nanjing optical labs .",
    "it was designed independently but has the same function as atst sbms @xcite , and it was equipped with a 16-bit ccd camera ( sbig402me , 765@xmath3510 pixels ) . since then , this new sbm has been used for sky brightness measurements at many different high - altitude sites of at least 3000 m above sea level ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "important calibration parameters have also been obtained for it .",
    "the instrumental scattered light for different wavelengths are obtained to be 0.77 , 0.81 , 2.12 , and 3.26 millionths for the blue , green , red and water vapor bandpasses , respectively .",
    "a comparison between the cgst sbm and the one used in the atst site survey in can be found in table  [ t - table1 ] , which shows that their instrumental scattered light levels are comparable but that of the cgst sbm seems slightly better .",
    "if we adopt a simple model of plane - parallel atmosphere , our sbm measurement can be translated into the changes in solar illuminance as small as @xmath4 ( from figure  [ simulation ] ) during the eclipse , where _",
    "i _ is the sun s illuminance without any obscuration by the moon .",
    "for comparison , a large impulsive x - ray flare can contribute to the solar illuminance increase in the whole visible spectral region like @xmath5  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus we are satisfied with the sbm sensitivity .    in 2011 us national solar observatory had shipped their sbm system to us for calibrating the cgst sbm .",
    "the calibration data have been obtained and further calibration results will be shown in another paper",
    ".    there will be another annular eclipse to occur soon on 21 may 2012 in southeast of china .",
    "the difference is that this eclipse will happen near sunrise .",
    "we need to preset proper exposure times for the sbm to measure the brightness of the sky and the photosphere simultaneously in all four wavelengths , in order to reveal more information about the scattering process in the atmosphere .",
    "the authors thank the referee and the editor for many useful suggestions which improved the manuscript .",
    "this work has obtained encouragements and assistance from many colleagues .",
    "we thank especially hai - sheng ji , hui li , bai - rong zhang , ming - chan wu , ke lou , zhong liu , jun lin , lei yang , hou - kun ni and haiying zhang for discussion and support .",

    "<S> for the future development of chinese giant solar telescope ( cgst ) in western china , a new sky brightness monitor ( sbm ) has been produced for the site survey for cgst . to critically examine the performance and sensitivity of sbm </S>",
    "<S> , we used it in the observation of the annular solar eclipse in dali city , yunnan , on 15 january 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation met good weather condition with almost clear sky during the eclipse . </S>",
    "<S> the sbm measurement translates into the solar illuminance changes at a level of @xmath0  s@xmath1 during the eclipse . </S>",
    "<S> the time of the minimal sky brightness in the field of view ( fov ) is found consistent with the time of maximum eclipse . </S>",
    "<S> two local sky regions in the fov are chosen to make time series of calibrated skylight profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the sky brightness thus calibrated also shows good consistency with the eclipse , particularly between the second and the third contacts . the minimal sky brightness in each local sky region took place within half a minute from the corresponding predicted contact time . </S>",
    "<S> such small time delays were mainly caused by occasional cirri . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal sky brightness measured during the eclipse is a few millionths of @xmath2 with standard deviation of 0.11 millionths of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation supports that the single - scattering process ( optically thin conditions ) is the main contributor to the atmospheric scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that many important aerosol optical parameters can be deduced from our data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the new sbm is a sensitive sky photometer that can be used for our cgst and coronagraph site surveys . </S>"
