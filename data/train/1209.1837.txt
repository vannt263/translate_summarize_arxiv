    "two objects that are ubiquitous in the quantum optics literature are the qubit ( that is , a quantum two - level system ) and the quantum harmonic oscillator ( oscillator for brevity ) . from a mathematical point of view",
    "they are two of the simplest quantum systems , and yet they have been employed to model accurately a wide variety of physical phenomena . as a notable example , composite qubit - oscillator systems have been very successful tools for modelling and understanding the interaction between matter and quantized radiation @xcite .",
    "recently , however , substantial theoretical and experimental efforts have been directed in a somewhat opposite direction . rather than using these two objects merely as theoretical tools to model `` naturally available '' systems , current research focuses on _ engineering _ quantum systems such that their behaviour resembles that of qubits or oscillators as closely as possible .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to have accurate experimental control over these systems and their mutual interactions . this shift of perspective is partly due to the emergence of research subjects related to quantum technologies , such as quantum information @xcite , and partly due to interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics .    in this spirit , experimental platforms such as nanomechanical resonators @xcite , ion traps @xcite , cavity qed @xcite and circuit qed",
    "@xcite have been capable of demonstrating a variety of qubit - oscillator models in the lab . not only can these systems reproduce fundamental light - matter interactions on a larger scale and/or in completely different settings , they are also able to explore these interactions in parameter regimes that are unavailable at the microscopic level @xcite , and even simulate qubit - oscillator hamiltonians that have a qualitatively different form as compared to the `` natural '' interactions .",
    "this increased flexibility suggests the possibility of studying hamiltonians that are alternative to e.g. the standard jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics @xcite , with a focus on their applicability to quantum technologies and to foundational studies of quantum mechanics .",
    "here we are concerned with one such model .",
    "we consider a particular form of interaction hamiltonian between qubits and quantum harmonic oscillators , whose closed system dynamics generates _ qubit - controlled displacements_. that is , the time evolution resulting from our considered hamiltonian shifts the average values of the position and momentum of the oscillator , by an amount that depends on the internal state of the qubit .",
    "this simple mechanism can establish strong quantum correlations between the two parts of the system @xcite , which in turn can be exploited in many applications that are of general interest for both technological and fundamental reasons .",
    "these include the preparation of non - classical oscillator states @xcite , the preparation of entangled states that are robust against thermal noise @xcite , the reconstruction of the quantum state of single oscillators @xcite and oscillator networks @xcite , the realization of quantum communication tasks such as quantum teleportation or remote state preparation @xcite , the violation of bell inequalities @xcite , the thermometry of quantum oscillators @xcite , the measurement of geometric phases @xcite , the probing of oscillator coherences @xcite and many others .",
    "even a proposal for full quantum computation has been put forward which relies on the same mechanism @xcite . in view of these and other proposals , the need has arisen to identify suitable experimental set - ups where the model can be implemented , and to investigate quantitatively how decoherence affects the realization of the desired tasks .    in this paper we give a contribution towards answering such questions .",
    "we show how to realize the proposed qubit - oscillator model in several realistic experimental platforms , namely nanomechanical systems , ion traps , cavity qed and circuit qed , and we solve the master equation resulting from the inclusion of common decoherence mechanisms affecting both qubits and oscillators .",
    "this can be of general usefulness to anyone interested in the study of the proposed system .",
    "we then provide two relevant examples in which our techniques are applied to study the influence of the thermal environment on physical quantities of interest .",
    "first we study the time evolution of qubit - oscillator entanglement , arguably the key resource in many of the applications described above . as a second example",
    ", we investigate the capability of the system to produce oscillator states with negative wigner functions .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ themodel ]",
    "we introduce the model of interest , in particular presenting the general forms of the hamiltonian and master equation that will be considered throughout the paper . in section  [ experiments ]",
    "we provide a review of some experimental platforms where the model can be implemented , and for each considered system we include a detailed discussion of the necessary steps to obtain a master equation in the desired form . in section  [ solving ] we show how the master equation can be solved in its general form , and in particular we derive analytical expressions which are valid in many cases of interest . in section  [ examples ] our techniques are applied to study the dynamics of qubit - oscillator entanglement and the preparation of non - classical oscillator states , while in section  [ fine ] we draw our conclusions .",

    "we suppose that such interaction is bilinear with respect to the qubit operator @xmath3 [ where ( @xmath4 ) is a right - handed tern of pauli matrices ] and the oscillator position , and we allow the coupling strength @xmath5 to be a generic function of time .",
    "the hamiltonian thus reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a frequency that does not need to coincide with the natural frequency of the oscillator .      for the time being , let us assume that the system is closed , i.e. , that its interaction with the external environment is negligible on the timescales of interest . under this assumption , the density matrix obeys the liouville equation @xcite @xmath8.\\label{liouville}\\ ] ] this equation is formally solved by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the initial state of the system , while @xmath11 is the unitary time - evolution operator , which verifies the time - dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath12 solving eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) is in general difficult , since it involves the calculation of a time - ordered exponential . in our case",
    ", however , the time ordering operation just yields a global phase factor which can be ignored for our purposes @xcite .",

    "note that we have assumed that the environment acts independently on the two constituents of our system , and in particular , that the decoherence terms in the master equation are not affected by the variations in the qubit - oscillator coupling .",

    "@xcite for a similar issue arising in driven solid state qubits ] .",
