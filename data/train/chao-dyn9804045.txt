    "in the last years the emergence of non trivial collective behaviour in high - dimensional dynamical systems has gathered much attention @xcite .",
    "an interesting limit case of macroscopic coherence is the global synchronization of all the parts of the system : this behaviour has been found in many different situations in physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "relevant examples of synchronization are the flickering of swarms of fireflies , fish locomotion , josephson arrays and certain multi - mode laser systems @xcite",
    ".    beyond synchronization there exist much more interesting and intriguing phenomena involving non trivial coherence .",
    "let us mention the relevant works of kaneko @xcite showing the emergence of subtle coherence among different elements of globally coupled maps ( gcm ) , in the case of a logistic local map .",
    "a gcm system ( of the type considered in this paper ) is a collection of elements @xmath0 ( defined on the site @xmath1 ) evolving according to the equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total number of elements , @xmath4 is the discrete time and @xmath5 is a nonlinear function depending on a parameter @xmath6 .    when the mapping function is @xmath7 ( i.e. a logistic map ) , for certain values of @xmath8 and @xmath6 one can observe rather remarkable behaviours , as anomalous fluctuations , glassy behaviour and broken ergodicity @xcite .",
    "for instance , kaneko @xcite studied a parameters region where the number of positive lyapunov exponents is proportional to @xmath3 ; in this region the local elements @xmath0 take different values , almost randomly , so one might expect that the temporal fluctuations of the mean - field @xmath9 obey a gaussian statistics , with a mean square deviation @xmath10 proportional to @xmath11 . on",
    "the contrary one observes @xmath12 , as @xmath13 . only with the inclusion of noise one",
    "obtains @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , if the noise is not too strong .",
    "this is due to a coherence ( collective behaviour ) among the elements @xmath0 , that can be associated @xcite with the existence of the periodic windows in the chaotic region of the logistic map",
    ".    in some regions of the parameters space one observes clustering @xcite , i.e. , the elements @xmath0 split into clusters , such that the elements belonging to the same cluster @xmath16 take an identical value @xmath17 .",
    "the number @xmath18 of the possible clusters can be very large with @xmath3 ( @xmath19 ) and the dynamics can show glass - like behaviour and failure of ergodicity @xcite .",
    "symplectic gcm , where the coupling is not of the mean - field type of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) , can show a more intriguing behaviour for the clustered motion , since , in this case , the synchronization between the different parts is not perfect and the clustering has a finite lifetime @xcite .",
    "even coupled map lattices ( cml ) with local coupling , on @xmath20-dimensional lattices , can show a macroscopic behaviour that is very different from the microscopic one .",
    "for example , chat and manneville @xcite showed that in cml on hyper - cubic @xmath20-dimensional lattices some macroscopic variables , as the center of mass : @xmath21 can have periodic behaviour , or quasi - periodic for @xmath22 , even if the system is chaotic , i.e. the first lyapunov exponent is positive .    in our opinion ,",
    "one of the more interesting facts among the many different aspects of the high - dimensional dynamical systems is the _",
    "macroscopic chaos_. with this locution we indicate the irregular behaviour of some global variables ( e.g. the center of mass ) that evolve with typical times much longer than the characteristic time of the full dynamics , that we call the microscopic dynamics ; the order of magnitude of the latter time may be estimated by the inverse of the first lyapunov exponent @xmath23 of the microscopic dynamics    the macroscopic chaos for the high - dimensional maps , in some sense , is the analogous of the hydrodynamical chaos for the molecular motion .",
    "let us briefly clarify this point and stress the open problems .",
    "for the hamiltonian dynamical system describing the evolution of the molecules of a fluid the order of magnitude of the microscopic characteristic time is the mean collision time . on the other hand ,",
    "if one studies the hydrodynamic equations of the considered fluid  those describing the motion on space and time scales that are very large with respect to the molecular scales  the involved characteristic times are much larger .",
    "so one expects that for the full hamiltonian dynamics @xmath24 , while the first lyapunov exponent for the hydrodynamic equations , in a chaotic regime , is of order @xmath25 , the exact value depending on the geometry of the system , the external forcing , the reynolds number and so on .",
    "this big difference comes from the coarse graining process in the building of the hydrodynamic equations , that is from the very different scales one is observing in the two cases .",
    "if one is able to write down the equations at the hydrodynamical level ( i.e. for the slow variables ) then it is not difficult to characterize the macroscopic behaviour , by means of the standard techniques of dynamical system theory .",
    "however in this case , one subtle point , on the mathematical side , is the problem of the norm to be used in the definition of the lyapunov exponents . for finite dimensional systems all the norms",
    "are equivalent @xcite and there is no ambiguity .",
    "this is not true for infinite dimensional systems ( as the hydrodynamical partial differential equations are ) , so that the lyapunov exponents can depend on the used norm .    in generic cml ,",
    "as far as we know , there are no general systematic methods to build up the macroscopic equations ; therefore it is necessary to study the macroscopic behaviour of the system in terms of the @xmath0 variables , i.e. it is necessary to remain at the microscopic level of description .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we report some phenomenology of macroscopic chaos in gcm .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to a discussion on the recently proposed self - consistent perron - frobenius method for the one - body description of these systems at a macroscopic level . in section [ sec:4 ] , that is the nucleus of the paper ,",
    "we show that the recently introduced _ finite size lyapunov exponent _ gives a suitable quantitative characterization of the macroscopic chaos ; that is to say : we are able to identify a macroscopic characteristic time by means of a lyapunov exponent that is effective on the macroscopic scales and which , in general , is much smaller than the usually defined one .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we discuss some subtle points related to the problem of the choice of the norm in the definition of the lyapunov exponent for the one - body description .",
    "for sake of self - consistency , we report some numerical evidence ( partly already known from previous works @xcite ) of the existence of macroscopic chaos in gcm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) . for a detailed description of the many different macroscopic behaviours",
    "see the works of kaneko @xcite and also pikovsky and kurths @xcite .",
    "we studied mainly systems ( [ eq : uno ] ) of globally coupled tent maps , i.e. : @xmath26 , and all the figures of this paper refer to these systems .",
    "in addition , to test the validity of our method , we also considered a slightly different version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) , the so - called heterogeneous gcm @xcite , in which the interacting elements are not all identical : @xmath27 the control parameters @xmath28 are quenched variables that take values according to some rule to be specified .",
    "here we chose @xmath29 ( the logistic map ) , with @xmath28 assuming equally spaced values in an interval between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    at varying @xmath8 and @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) or @xmath30 and @xmath31 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dueuno ] ) , and by looking at the evolution of a macroscopic variable as , for instance , @xmath32 , we observed different macroscopic behaviours , which can be grouped in the three following classes .",
    "i ) : :    standard chaos : the microscopic lyapunov exponent is positive and the    law of large numbers holds . in this case , if one plots    @xmath32 versus @xmath33 , one observes a spot    with size of order @xmath34 .",
    "ii ) : :    macroscopic periodicity : the microscopic lyapunov exponent is positive    and the plot of @xmath32 versus @xmath33 gives    rise to @xmath16 spots with size of order    @xmath34 , for a macroscopic motion of period    @xmath16 .",
    "there are also less trivial periodic or    quasi - periodic behaviours ( e.g. in @xcite a case is shown in which    the mean - field dynamics evolves on a 2-dimensional torus ) .",
    "iii ) : :    macroscopic chaos : the microscopic lyapunov exponent is positive and    the plot of @xmath32 versus @xmath33 shows an    apparently well structurated function , see fig .",
    "1 , that suggests    chaotic motion for @xmath32 .",
    "the first hope is that , at a macroscopic level , the system can be described by few global variables , that are able to catch the large scale properties , i.e. one hopes that the macroscopic motion is driven by a low dimensional dynamics .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "1a ( that is obtained for particular parameters values of the tent gcm ) , seems to suggest such a possibility : the first - return plot for the center of mass evolution appears to generate a one dimensional map . in such a case",
    "one can conjecture that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a small ( @xmath37 ) incoherent fluctuation , vanishing in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "if the above equation holds  with the evolution function @xmath39 fitted from the data  one can define the lyapunov exponent for dynamical system ( [ eq : duedue ] ) .",
    "this latter quantity gives information on the sensibility of the evolution of the macroscopic variable @xmath40 on the initial conditions , so that one may call it _",
    "lyapunov exponent @xmath41 ; according to the standard definition , one has : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability distribution of @xmath40 , as obtained from numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) . in the case of macroscopic chaos one expects that @xmath44 . on the contrary , using the recipe of eq .",
    "( [ eq : duetre ] ) one obtains that @xmath41 is negative .",
    "this result is not a paradox : simply eq .",
    "( [ eq : duedue ] ) does not hold .",
    "if one looks carefully at the plot of @xmath32 versus @xmath33 , for large @xmath3 , one realizes that very fine grained structures exist , see fig .",
    "this suggests that the variable @xmath32 alone is not sufficient for a satisfying description of the macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "therefore we need to introduce some other variables .",
    "it seems likely that the system evolution at a macroscopic scale is driven by a full set of equations of phenomenological type , such as , e.g. : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are small fluctuations vanishing as @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , as far as we know , there is not a systematic approach ( even of numerical type ) for the building of eq.s ( [ eq : duequattro ] ) , i.e. for the determination of the functions @xmath49 .    another naive approach , based on the possible _ time scales separation _ between the microscopic and the macroscopic dynamics , is the analysis of the microscopic and macroscopic time correlation functions , defined as follows : @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 means time average along the trajectory .",
    "it is to be noted , at this point , that the system we are studying shows a non trivial macroscopic behaviour in a parameter region where it is also in a broken ergodicity phase . in fig .",
    "2 we show the probability distributions , @xmath53 , of two different @xmath54 for the system ( [ eq : uno ] ) in a situation of macroscopic chaos .",
    "it is well evident that the knowledge of the probability distribution of a generic @xmath54 does not permit a good description of the system ( this is what we mean , in such a setting , by saying that the system is not ergodic ) .",
    "it is important to note that the two elements have been chosen in the two different bands in which the @xmath55 are grouped , see @xcite .",
    "moreover elements belonging to the same band seems to have the same distributions .",
    "let us stress that this behaviour is not related to the particular band structure of the tent gcm : we found non trivial macroscopic motion in the presence of broken ergodicity also in heterogeneous gcm ( [ eq : dueuno ] ) , where the band structure is absent , but the microscopic building elements are not identical .",
    "3 shows the above defined correlation functions in the regime of macroscopic chaos .",
    "since one has a failure of the ergodicity , different sites have different autocorrelations , that is @xmath56 depends on the band to which the element @xmath57 belongs .",
    "rather unexpected is the fact that the characteristic decay times of @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , defined by the equations @xmath61 are not very different ; for instance , in the case of fig . 3 one has : @xmath62 .",
    "a non trivial point is that these typical decay times are much larger than the characteristic time given by the lyapunov exponent , i.e. @xmath63 ( for the system of fig .",
    "3 one has @xmath64 ) .",
    "this fact can be related to the strong intermittency of the system .",
    "we have to stress that this behaviour of the correlation times has been observed also in the heterogeneous logistic gcm ( [ eq : dueuno ] ) .    in the next sections we discuss some less naive approaches to the characterization of the macroscopic chaos .",
    "let us now discuss how one can try to characterize the coherent dynamics of gcm in terms of a suitable perron - frobenius ( pf ) operator @xcite . at any time",
    "@xmath4 one can wonder about the snapshot density @xmath65 , defined by the probability density that @xmath66 assumes the value @xmath67 : @xmath68 using the fact that , for a mean field coupling as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uno ] ) , each @xmath0 interacts with all the other @xmath69 in the same way , the time evolution of @xmath70 can be written in terms of @xmath71 , by means of a self - consistent approach : @xmath72 where the sum is on the preimages given by @xmath73 @xmath74 being the inverse function of @xmath75 , for instance , if @xmath76 then @xmath77 .    in the parameter region of the standard chaos ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] ) where @xmath78 , one has that , after long times , @xmath79 converges toward a stationary distribution @xmath80 , i.e. : @xmath81 on the other hand , for a macroscopic periodic behaviour , the long time properties of the density @xmath82 are described by means of a finite collection of functions of @xmath67 ; e.g. when @xmath32 asymptotically oscillates among two different values : @xmath83 after a transient time one observes @xmath84 finally , in the case of macroscopic chaos @xmath85 does not converge toward any finite set of function of @xmath67 , but evolves following a nontrivial time behaviour .    the above approach for @xmath85 has been introduced by perez and cerdeira @xcite and k. kaneko @xcite . from a conceptual point of view",
    "eq.s ( [ eq : tredue ]  [ eq : tretre ] ) are close to the boltzmann equation for the gases @xcite . indeed , as one can check by a direct inspection , the pf operator @xmath86 that rules the evolution of the probability density @xmath87 in the whole phase space : @xmath88 is a linear operator . on the other hand",
    "the pf operator @xmath89 for the evolution of @xmath85 , given by eq.s ( [ eq : tredue ]  [ eq : tretre ] ) , is a nonlinear one @xcite , since it depends explicitly on @xmath90 . in the kinetic theory of gases",
    "one has a similar situation : the liouville equation , for the evolution of the probability density in the whole phase space , is linear , while the boltzmann equation for the one - body statistics is nonlinear .    since the evolution equations ( [ eq : tredue ]  [ eq : tretre ] ) for @xmath85 are a dynamical system ( though of infinite dimension )",
    ", one can formally introduce the notion of first lyapunov exponent @xcite . by so doing ,",
    "as noted in the introduction , one is faced with the mathematical problem of the choice of the norm : for sake of simplicity we adopt the usual norm in the @xmath91 space .",
    "one could think that the problem of the norm is relevant just for strictly mathematical reasons , while from a physical point of view this problem practically does not exist . in the appendix",
    "we discuss how even for very simple shapes of @xmath92 one obtains different lyapunov exponents using different norms .",
    "however to practically obtain the first lyapunov exponent , firstly one applies an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath93 on @xmath85 ( in order to satisfy the normalization condition one has to impose the constraint @xmath94 ) then one observes the evolution @xmath95 of the perturbation . in this way , following the standard methods of benettin et al .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to estimate the whole set of the lyapunov exponents @xmath96 ; in particular one has @xmath97",
    "it is easy to understand that @xmath98 can give interesting `` global information '' which is completely different from the one given by the microscopic lyapunov exponent . in the case of standard chaos , or macroscopic periodic behaviour ,",
    "@xmath98 is negative , or zero , while for macroscopic chaos @xmath99 .",
    "let us stress that @xmath98 can be negative even if the first lyapunov exponent for the dynamical equations ( [ eq : uno ] ) is positive .",
    "some detailed numerical investigation of kaneko on gcm show that @xmath98 is positive in the cases of macroscopic chaos @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : tredue ]  [ eq : tretre ] ) hold only in the case of a mean field interaction for homogeneous gcm ( eq . [ eq : uno ] ) and other particular systems @xcite , but they are not valid even for the heterogeneous gcm ( eq . [ eq : dueuno ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the computation of @xmath98 according to the definition ( [ eq : trequattro ] ) , remains possible using a numerical approach  at least in principle , even if it may result in a very huge and heavy task  also for generic cml ( i.e. , in the case of maps with local coupling ) .",
    "this is accomplished by following the evolution of @xmath85 , as given by the time development of the histogram of the instantaneous microscopic configuration @xmath100 .",
    "besides the previous relevant properties of @xmath98 , we have to underline a delicate point that rises for its numerical computation , when it is not possible to write down the appropriate eq .",
    "( [ eq : tredue ] ) . in this case , as we already pointed , one is forced to study the evolution of @xmath101 making histograms from two instantaneous configurations @xmath102 and @xmath103 , obtained by the introduction of a small perturbation on @xmath102 at @xmath104 . to show where is the problem , let us consider the time evolution of @xmath105 in the case of standard chaos .",
    "one can write @xmath106 in two different ways : @xmath107 @xmath108 if we are in the parameters region where the lyapunov exponent @xmath109 is positive , but @xmath98 is negative , we have both @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "so that apparently we fall into a contradiction , since from ( [ eq : trecinquea ] ) we obtain @xmath112 ) holds at small scales : @xmath113 , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : treseib ] ) holds for @xmath114 . basically if one starts with a perturbation @xmath115 much smaller than @xmath116 one has an exponential growth , but only up to a magnitude @xmath116 , the maximum allowed by the laws of large numbers . in an analogous manner starting from a perturbation @xmath115 much larger than @xmath116 one has an exponential decrease up to @xmath116 ,",
    "4 .    from the previous example",
    "it is clear that if one studies numerically the time evolution of @xmath117 for large but finite @xmath3 , at small times ( or , more precisely , small @xmath118 ) one can observe just the `` microscopic '' lyapunov exponent .",
    "so one has to introduce some coarse - graining ",
    "i.e. to consider non infinitesimal @xmath119  to obtain a macroscopic level description",
    ". however , it must be noted that there is a large arbitrariness in choosing a non infinitesimal @xmath119 .    in this section",
    "we have discussed the computation of the macroscopic lyapunov exponent by means of the perron - frobenius method , both in its original formulation eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tredue] [ eq : tretre ] ) and in its numerical version , to be applied when the p - f equation can not be explicitly written .",
    "neither approach is easy to handle because of the arbitrariness in the choice of the norm and of the non infinitesimal @xmath119 .    in order to avoid these difficulties ( numerical and conceptual ) concerning the one - body description , in the next section we introduce a different approach",
    "the introduction of efficient methods ( benettin et al .",
    "@xcite ) for the computation of the lyapunov exponents has been an important milestone in the understanding of chaotic systems",
    ". however , in spite of their deep conceptual relevance , the lyapunov exponents are not able to give a complete characterization of realistic dynamical systems , such as systems with intermittent behaviour or with many different characteristic times .",
    "for example , in order to describe intermittency effects one needs to introduce generalized lyapunov exponents and the statistics of the fluctuations of the effective lyapunov exponent @xcite . on the other hand in systems with many different characteristic times (",
    "e.g. the fully developed turbulence ) the lyapunov exponent can not be used to study , even at very rough level , the predictability problem for small ( but not infinitesimal ) perturbations , that can not be described in terms of the tangent vector . in order to overcome these difficulties",
    "recently a new indicator has been introduced : the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the definition of fsle may be given in terms of the predictability time @xmath120 , that is the time a perturbation of initial size @xmath121 takes to grow by a factor @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) during the system evolution .",
    "the perturbation of size @xmath121 is supposed to be already aligned with the most unstable direction .",
    "the factor @xmath122 should be taken not too large , in order to avoid the growth trough different scales . in many applications , @xmath124 ,",
    "so that sometimes the @xmath120 is also called the error doubling time .",
    "the finite size lyapunov exponent is defined from a suitable average of the predictability time according to @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes average with the natural measure along the trajectory and @xmath127 is the average over many realizations , for more details see ref .",
    "the above definition holds for continuous time system . in the case of discrete time systems ( i.e. maps )",
    "@xmath120 is the minimum time such that the distance @xmath128 between the two realizations is greater or equal to @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , instead of eq .",
    "( [ fsle ] ) we have @xcite : @xmath130    let us note that by the definition ( [ fsle ] ) @xmath131 is not appropriate in discerning cases with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , due to the positiveness of the predictability time .    for chaotic systems the limit of infinitesimal perturbations @xmath134 in ( [ fsle ] ) gives the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath135 , i.e. @xmath131 displays a plateau at the value @xmath135 for sufficiently small @xmath121 .    in many realistic situations , the error growth for infinitesimal perturbations",
    "is dominated by the faster scales , that are typically the smaller ones ( as in the classic example of three dimensional turbulent flows ) . when the size @xmath121 of the perturbation can not be considered any longer infinitesimal ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath131 is governed by the nonlinear evolution of the perturbation , and , in general , @xmath136 . the decrease of @xmath131 does follow a system - dependent law . in some cases ,",
    "@xmath131 can be predicted by dimensional arguments , e.g. in the fully developed turbulence one has the universal law @xmath137 , in the inertial range @xcite .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of @xmath138 as a function of @xmath121 gives important information on the characteristic times ( and scales @xcite ) governing the system and is a powerful tool in studying dynamical systems which involve many characteristic scales in space and time .",
    "the fsle has been successfully used even in time series analysis @xcite .",
    "a relevant practical fact is that , at variance with the usual lyapunov exponent which needs high embedding dimensions and extremely huge statistic , the fsle at relatively large @xmath121 can be extracted even using moderately small embedding dimension . for example , in systems in which some slow variables can be separated from the fast variables , the fsle related to the slow dynamics can be obtained even with moderate statistics and unresolved small scales ( i.e. the fast ones ) .    to practically compute the fsle , firstly one has to define a series of thresholds @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , and to measure the times @xmath141 that a perturbation of size @xmath142 takes to grow up to @xmath143 .",
    "the times @xmath141 are obtained by following the evolution of a perturbation from its initial size @xmath144 up to the largest threshold @xmath145 .",
    "this can be done by integrating two trajectories of the system starting at an initial distance @xmath146 .",
    "the fsle , @xmath147 , is then computed by averaging the predictability times over several realizations , see equation ( [ fsle : map ] ) . in general , one must choose @xmath148 , in order to allow the direction of the initial perturbation to align with the most unstable direction in the phase - space .",
    "moreover , one must pay attention to keep @xmath149 , so that all the thresholds can be attained .",
    "our hope is that , as in the usual hydrodynamical description of thermodynamic systems , the variables of systems with macroscopic chaos can be separated in slow variables ( given by @xmath32 , @xmath150 and so on ) and fast variables .",
    "we have computed the fsle ( [ fsle ] ) looking only at @xmath32 both for the homogeneous gcm ( [ eq : uno ] ) , using as local map the tent map , and for the heterogeneous gcm ( [ eq : dueuno ] ) , for different values of the parameters .",
    "practically the numerical experiments has been performed as follows : we have averaged , over many realizations , the predictability times @xmath141 ( defined above ) related to @xmath151 which is initialized at the value @xmath152 .",
    "this has been done considering , for each realization , the perturbed system that is obtained by shifting all the elements of the unperturbed one by the quantity @xmath146 ( i.e. @xmath153 ) .    as can be seen from figure 5a , which shows @xmath131 versus @xmath121 in the case with macroscopic chaos , two plateaux",
    "exist : at small values of @xmath121 ( @xmath154 ) one has , as expected from general considerations , @xmath155 ; for @xmath156 one has another plateau which can fairly be called `` macroscopic '' lyapunov exponent , @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , @xmath158 and @xmath159 decrease at increasing @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , from figure 5b , where we report @xmath131 versus @xmath160 for different values of @xmath3 , one can see that both @xmath161 and @xmath162 scale as @xmath37 : by rescaling @xmath121 with @xmath163 , one observes that @xmath164 ( which indicates the end of the microscopic plateau ) and @xmath165 ( which marks the end of the saturation due to the microscopic dynamics and the beginning of the macroscopic plateau ) coincide for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "incidentally , one can also observe that the macroscopic plateau , being almost non - existent for @xmath166 , becomes more and more resolved and extended on large values of @xmath167 at increasing @xmath3 up to @xmath168 . from these features",
    "we can argue that the macroscopic motion is well defined in the limit @xmath169 and therefore we can conjecture that in this limit the microscopic signature in the evolution of @xmath105 completely disappears in favor of the macroscopic behaviour .",
    "it is important to note that in order to obtain the results shown in fig.5 and fig.7 some precautions must be taken in initializing the system .",
    "in fact , because of the complex structure of the phase space of this system , one has that different initial conditions can led to different attractors @xcite .",
    "therefore , choosing random initial conditions while increasing @xmath3 , one likely obtains different values for the macroscopic and/or microscopic lyapunov exponents . in order to maintain the system on the same attractor , we kept fixed the percentage of elements _ per _ band ( see kaneko @xcite ) , at varying the number of elements @xmath3 .    in the case of standard chaos ( @xmath170 )",
    "one has only the microscopic plateau and then a fast decreasing of @xmath131 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "also in the cases of non trivial macroscopic behaviour , either periodic or quasi - periodic ( i.e. @xmath171 ) , we see only the microscopic plateau followed by a decreasing up to the saturation .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath131 is not able to distinguish between @xmath172 and @xmath132 , by definition , see eq .",
    "( [ fsle ] ) .",
    "one can wonder if it is possible to compute the macroscopic lyapunov exponent directly looking at @xmath173 versus @xmath4 .",
    "the macroscopic regime is expected to appear as a change of slope when the size of the perturbation is @xmath116 ( as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] in the case of standard chaos ) . in fig .",
    "7 @xmath173 is shown as a function of @xmath4 for the same systems of fig .",
    "5 ( with identical initial conditions ) . one can see that for small values of @xmath105 one has a well defined exponential growth according to the microscopic lyapunov exponent .",
    "this regime stops at @xmath174 i.e. when the microscopic error growth saturates . at larger values of @xmath105",
    "one observes a second ( macroscopic ) slope .",
    "one has a clear evidence also from fig . 7 that the macroscopic motion sets in at a scale that is smaller when @xmath3 is larger , as already established by the analysis of fig .",
    "5 . in the case of fig .",
    "7 one has also a fair quantitative agreement with the results obtained with the fsle method ( fig .",
    "however in general , because of the intermittency , the macroscopic regime can start at different times and with different rates , therefore the naive method in which the averages are performed at fixed delay times can give spurious laws ; see ref @xcite for a discussion of these effects .    of course _",
    "a priori _ there is no deep reason to believe that the above analysis performed only on one variable , @xmath32 , is enough accurate , therefore we performed a similar study looking at two macroscopic variables , @xmath32 and @xmath150 .",
    "since there is not a natural way to introduce a perturbation on @xmath32 and @xmath150 , we are forced to follow the method of wolf et al .",
    "@xcite for the computation of the lyapunov exponent from data , but with some modifications .",
    "we considered the phase space generated by the variables @xmath32 , @xmath150 and we looked at the time separation between _ analogues _ whose initial distance @xmath175 is not very small ( i.e. in the region of the `` macroscopic '' plateau in fig . 5 ) . following the evolution of the full system",
    "we compute the quantity : @xmath176 where @xmath177 , @xmath178 are the `` return '' times such that @xmath179 $ ] and @xmath180 is the number of analogues . fig .",
    "8 shows @xmath181 versus @xmath182 .",
    "it is important to stress the relevance of the value of @xmath183 , which must be not too small . using a @xmath183 out of the `` macroscopic '' ( i.e. @xmath184 ) plateau one has spurious behaviour due to intermittency ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable the agreement between the values for the macroscopic lyapunov exponent obtained with the two methods .",
    "in this paper we proposed a quantitative characterization of the coherent evolution in globally coupled maps that show _ macroscopic chaos_. from a conceptual point of view , the irregular behaviours of global observables  which typically evolve on time scales much longer than those related to the evolution of a single element @xmath185  are for the gcm the analogous of the chaos for hydrodynamical equations in the description of the molecular motion .    in generic systems",
    "there are not a systematic method to obtain the equations that describe the evolution of the degrees of freedom accounting for the large scale behaviour .",
    "therefore a straightforward application of the usual dynamical systems methods is not able to give suitable characterizations . in particular , the usual lyapunov exponent , which gives a microscopic description ,",
    "is not able to capture the essential features of this macroscopic phenomenon .",
    "it is worth to note that in the cases where it is possible to derive hydrodynamical - like equations , such as the perron - frobenius equation , one obtains a description of the system at a macroscopic level , see for a detailed discussion @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , in the cases in which this approach is missing , the recently introduced finite size lyapunov exponent @xcite is able to characterize , in a consistent way , the macroscopic behaviour of the system and gives a measure of the chaotic motion at a coarse - grained level .",
    "we have the following scale - dependent scenario for the mechanism acting on the evolution of the perturbation of global observables ( i.e. the mean field ) :    * at small values of the perturbation ( @xmath186 ) we recover the microscopic lyapunov exponent , simply because at these scales the evolution of the perturbation is driven by the microscopic dynamics ; * at larger values ( @xmath187 ) we obtain a macroscopic lyapunov exponent , which can be much smaller than the first lyapunov exponent of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the above scenario is confirmed using ( with some important changes ) the method of wolf et al .",
    "@xcite for the computation of the lyapunov exponent from numerical data .",
    "basically , in presence of macroscopic chaos one observes that : the variables of the system are separated in slow variables ( e.g. @xmath188 ) and fast variables ( see fig.s 5 and 7 ) . for a discussion of the fsle in systems with slow and fast dynamics",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us stress that also with a naive numerical treatment of the one - body description one can observe a rather clear evidence for the two regimes ( the microscopic and the macroscopic ones ) characterized by two very different `` lyapunov exponent '' .",
    "but , as discussed in the appendix , the problem of the choice of the norm ( that is present also working with the histograms ) gives some unavoidable troubles which do not allow for a detailed comparison with the other methods .",
    "finally , it is interesting to mention the case of `` single - band '' chaos ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where one has irregular behaviour with some macroscopic coherence , but there is not a separation between the microscopic and the macroscopic scales .",
    "the microscopic lyapunov exponent has the same value of the macroscopic one ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "this means that in this case  as fig .",
    "9 shows  @xmath131 has a single plateau , extending over a range of scales larger than that of the standard chaos ( fig .",
    "6 ) , so as to include the macroscopic scales . let us remark that this case of `` single - band '' chaos is reminiscent of the two - dimensional turbulence @xcite , where the @xmath131 does not depend on @xmath121 in a very large range of values ; that is , a broad range of scales have equal characteristic times .",
    "after the submission of this paper , the authors are informed of the recent preprint by t. shibata and k. kaneko `` collective chaos '' ( chao - dyn/9805009 ) , where a related study is presented . in particular ,",
    "t. shibata and k. kaneko use the fsle to study the macroscopic properties of a heterogeneous gcm .",
    "their results are in agreement with ours .",
    "one could naively think that the behaviour of @xmath151 and @xmath190 give the same information . in this appendix",
    "we show that the above idea does not work because of the unavoidable troubles related to the choice of a norm for @xmath191 .    in order to show this we discuss two explicit cases which clarify this point . as first example",
    "we consider @xmath92 uniform in the interval @xmath192 $ ] and the perturbed distribution @xmath193 uniform in the interval @xmath194 $ ] , i.e. with a shifted average .",
    "let us now compute two different norms of @xmath195 : @xmath196 @xmath197 assuming that @xmath106 is related to a gcm system , it is clear that the computation of the lyapunov exponents according to the norms defined above gives , in this case ( uniform distribution ) , two lyapunov exponent different by a factor two .",
    "nevertheless with different shape of the distribution we have different results . to show this last issue we consider now a @xmath92 with a symmetric triangular shape in the interval @xmath192 $ ] and zero for @xmath198 or @xmath199 .",
    "the perturbed @xmath200 has the same functional form with the average shifted of @xmath106 .",
    "the same computations as before lead to : @xmath201 @xmath202    from the above examples it is clear that the relation between @xmath203 and @xmath118 depends dramatically on the explicit norm used and on the shape of the @xmath204 . in addition , in the real time evolution of @xmath191 one has not only shifting of the average but also variations of @xmath205 and other parameters of the distribution that complicate the interpretation of @xmath118 in terms of @xmath203 . therefore there is no reason to expect a quantitative agreement between numerical study ( using histograms ) of the one - body description and @xmath151 .",
