    "<S> joint signal - idler photoelectron distributions of twin beams containing several tens of photons per mode have been measured recently . exploiting a microscopic quantum theory for joint quasi - distributions in parametric down - conversion developed </S>",
    "<S> earlier we characterize properties of twin beams in terms of quasi - distributions using experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> negative values as well as oscillating behaviour in quantum region are characteristic for the subsequently determined joint signal - idler quasi - distributions of integrated intensities . also the conditional and difference photon - number distributions are shown to be sub - poissonian and sub - shot - noise , respectively . </S>"
