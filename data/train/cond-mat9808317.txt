    "the evolution of the genetic material is determined by the interactions among mutations , random drift and natural selection .    the mutation rate seems to vary both among and within genomes , being affected by many factors , such as the chromosomal position ( sharp _ et al .",
    "_ , 1989 ) , the g+c content ( wolfe , 1991 ) , the nearest neighbor bases ( blake _ et al . _ , 1992 ) , the different efficiency of the repair systems between the lagging and the leading dna strands during replication and transcription ( veaute & fuchs , 1993 ) . thus the molecular clock seems to tick at different rate for different dna positions .",
    "the natural selection acts as a driving force at virtually all levels of the genetic information processing and biological organization : from the dna stability , replication and transcription to messenger rna life span and translation efficiency , to the correct functioning of the gene products in the building up and propagation of a living organism .",
    "although in principle all these constraints could interact in a very complex way , it is indeed fruitful to try to untangle the role of each element .",
    "we have focused on the translation process as a major source of fitness for the bacterial cell .    because of the degeneracy of the genetic code and the historical process of codon capture ( osawa & jukes , 1989 ) , different codons ( synonymous codons)specify for the same amino acid .",
    "the bias in the codon usage is generally not random and it is very marked in some procaryotic and eucaryotic genes .",
    "the codon choice is specie - specific ( grantham _ et al .",
    "_ , 1980 ) , being roughly the same , although with different intensities , in all the genes within a genome .",
    "the codon bias is thought to be an effect of the improvement of the efficiency of the translation process under natural selection .",
    "several authors have stressed that synonymous codons in _ e. coli _ , preferentially used in highly expressed genes , are translated by the most abundant iso - acceptors trna species and that the levels of trnas in bacterial cells depend on the amino acid usage in proteins ( ikemura , 1981a ) .",
    "a good correlation between codon usage and trnas population has also been found in _",
    "mycoplasma capricolum _",
    "( yamao _ et al . _ , 1991 ) , in yeast ( ikemura , 1981b ) ( ikemura , 1985 ) and in chloroplast genomes ( morton , 1993 ) .",
    "the importance of codon usage as a substrate for natural selection is well proved by the coding strategy of the coli phage _ t4 _ : the early expressed genes of _ t4 _ have a codon pattern close to that of _ e. coli _ while the late expressed genes show a preference towards the codons read by the trnas expressed by the genome of the phage itself ( cowe & sharp , 1991 ) .    the codon usage influences the elongation rate in the translation process , being the pairing between codon and anticodon of the diffusing trna the rate - limiting step compared with the peptide bond formation and translocation steps ( gouy & grantham , 1980 ) , but it can not be directly related to the protein expression rate . in fact",
    "many experiments have demonstrated that other crucial steps affecting the protein production rate are the selection of mrna by a ribosome , the initiation phase and the phenomenon of polypeptidyl - trna drop off ( menninger , 1978 ) .",
    "moreover the dynamic of elongation phase seems to be more complex , depending also by the differences in the energy of codon anticodon pairing ( grosjean & fiers , 1982 ) ( thomas _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) ; thus differences in elongation rates have been found for codons read by the same trna species ( sorensen & pedersen , 1991 ) .",
    "different considerations should be drawn on the evolutionary role of either the minor or the major codons .",
    "some authors have suggested that selection of some of the rarer trna species may be the rate - limiting step in protein synthesis ( varenne _ et al .",
    "_ , 1984 ) : they hypothesize that the rate of polypeptide elongation could act as a regulatory mechanism in gene expression when clusters of rare codons undergo translation , i.e. when the required trna concentration is low and rate - limiting .",
    "this hypothesis has been confirmed experimentally by manipulating the concentrations of some trnas and creating rate - limiting conditions .",
    "varenne ( goldman , 1982 ) ( varenne _ et al . _ , 1984 ) demonstrated experimentally that the presence of rare codons in highly expressed coding regions is associated with pauses in the synthesis of proteins .",
    "many different contexts have been tested with similar results : hoekema ( hoekema _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) replaced some major codons present in the first region of the _ pgk1 _ gene of _ saccharomices cerevisiae _ with synonymous minor codons ; kinnaird ( kinnaird _ et al . _ , 1991 ) generated a cluster of three rare codons in the _ gdh _ gene in _",
    "neurospora crassa_. chen and inouye ( chen & inouye , 1990 ) have demonstrated that the introduction of a cluster of a rare codon , agg , in _ lacz _ sequence of _ e. coli _ , lowers the expression of the gene ; moreover this effect is inversely correlated with the distance between the initiation site and the position of rare codons .",
    "models that takes into account the influence of minor codons in the initiation region of mrna for protein production rate have been presented ( liljenstrom & von heijne , 1987 ) ( liljenstrom & bomberg , 1987 ) .    on the contrary sharp and li (",
    "sharp & li , 1986 ) have hypothesized that the pattern of synonymous codon usage in regulatory genes reflects primarily the relaxation of natural selection .",
    "in fact , the absence of rare codons from highly expressed genes may well result from negative selection , while in low expressed genes , selection against rare codons is very weak and so they can accumulate under the pressure of mutation .",
    "remarkably different considerations should be drawn for the major codons , i.e. codons read by the most abundant trnas .",
    "there is evidence that the major proteins are translated faster than other proteins and that the elongation rate at major codons is faster than that at other codons ( emilsson & kurland , 1990a ) .",
    "some authors ( emilsson & kurland , 1990a ) ( emilsson & kurland , 1990b ) have hypothesized that growth rate , in bacteria , depends on trna abundance .",
    "such relation results in the so called growth maximization strategy and it is consistent with a major codon preference strategy , in which an optimal subset of codons is thought to be used very frequently in highly expressed genes , and their cognate trna species are supposed to increase considerably at high growth rates conditions .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that the genes for the major trna species are located inside rrna operons for a coordinate expression .",
    "the growth rate dependence on trna abundances and other aspects of the evolution of genes and genomes in bacteria can be faced with statistical mechanics tools .",
    "let us consider an homogeneous population of bacterial genomes , subjected only to synonymous mutations and natural selection .",
    "if we study its evolution in the proximity of a steady dynamical state , as for instance a balanced growth state , we can interpret the interaction between mutations and natural selection as a competition between randomness and order . in this spirit",
    "we develop a statistical model from which bacterial evolution emerges as an optimization process under environmental constraints .",
    "in order to study quantitatively the competition between mutation and natural selection in naturally occurring sequences , we concentrate on the process of the elongation phase .",
    "we suppose that the rate limiting step in this phase is the relative abundance of charged trnas .",
    "thus we assume that the time required by a ribosome to process a codon is inversely proportional to the abundance of the charged cognate trnas in its vicinity .",
    "taking into account the data from gouy and grantham ( gouy & grantham , 1980 ) , the process of trna diffusion in cell extract results much faster than all others processes involved in our schematization , and thus we do not consider the effects of spatial gradients .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the efficiency of aminoacyl - trna synthetases is not rate limiting , i.e. that the concentration of the charged trnas does not vary with the translation process regardless of the codon composition of mrnas .",
    "this approximation is not completely fulfilled in real bacteria . from the same source above",
    "( gouy & grantham , 1980 ) we obtain that in average only 85% of the trna pool is acylated , indicating that the reaction rate of synthetase is not substrate limited .    in this approximation",
    "we do not take into account the finite size of a ribosome , nor the queuing of ribosomes , thus disregarding the positional effects of codon usage , as considered elsewhere ( liljenstrom & bomberg , 1987 ) .    with this assumption ,",
    "the translation time does not depend on the order of codons in mrna and can be calculated as the sum of the time required for each codon .",
    "finally , we do not consider the influence of fluctuations , i.e. we develop a sort of `` mean field '' model for the translation .",
    "we indicate the portion of mrna that code for a protein ( or , alternatively , the whole mrna ) with a vector @xmath0 ; @xmath1  ( @xmath2 ) being the number of codons of type @xmath3 and @xmath4 the length of the coding region .",
    "we denote with @xmath5  the relative abundance of acylated trna of type @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ) . for _ e. coli _",
    "@xmath9 , see also the following section .",
    "the `` translational efficiency '' of codons by trnas is represented by means of a matrix @xmath10 of size @xmath11 . again from ( gouy & grantham , 1980 ) , the transpeptidation and translocation phases do not weight heavily on the trna cycle , and disregarding them , the mean time required to translate the codon @xmath12 is inversely proportional to @xmath13.@xmath14the mean translation time per codon @xmath15 ( in arbitrary time units )  is thus given by    @xmath16    for simplicity , the elements @xmath10 can be taken to be either @xmath17 , for a trna @xmath6 that does not pair with a codon @xmath3 , or @xmath18 , disregarding the differences in energies in the codon - anticodon pairing discussed in the previous section .    in bacteria ,",
    "cell division and dna  replication are coupled with cell growth ( zyskind & smith , 1992 ) ( ageno , 1992 ) .",
    "in balanced growth conditions the average number of genomes , the average number of cells and the cell mass increase exponentially with the same rate .",
    "the cell growth largely depends on the production rate of the most abundant biopolymers , among which ribosomal proteins constitute the larger fraction .",
    "the time @xmath15 in formula ( [ tau ] ) , calculated for an `` average '' ribosomal protein , can be considered proportional to the mean duplication time .",
    "we assume that the natural selection tends to lower this time .",
    "a somewhat opposite effect is due to the mutation process , that tends to randomize the codon sequence .",
    "since silent mutations do not change the coded aminoacid and thus they do not affect the composition of proteins , they are neutral for the selection over the protein functionality . however , silent mutation are not neutral for the calculation of the duplication time @xmath15 , because of the presence of the abundance of cognate trnas in formula ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "let us start from a  simplified situation , in which two synonymous codons ( say codon @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are only read by two trnas ( with respectively abundances @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , while all other codons are grouped together ( say codon @xmath21 ) and in average are read by trnas with abundance @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the number of synonymous codons is @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "we consider only mutations between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and vice versa .",
    "since @xmath15 does not depend on the order of the codons in the string , the various strains can be grouped together according with the number @xmath26 of one s in the mrna ( @xmath27 ) . for each group",
    "@xmath26 there are @xmath28 strains .",
    "we rewrite the formula ( [ tau ] ) for the time @xmath29 required to duplicate a bacterium belonging to group @xmath26 as @xmath30    the quantity @xmath31 is the relative abundance of the synonymous codons 0 and 1 in the coding region . for @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; for @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "since selection only acts on 0 and 1 codons , @xmath36 give an indication of the influence of selection on the gene .",
    "in the unit time interval , the number of duplications @xmath37 of the mass @xmath38 of bacteria belonging to group @xmath26 is @xmath39 , and thus @xmath40 where for simplicity we set all constants to @xmath18 and we neglect the time dependence of @xmath41 .    in the limit of very low mutation rate",
    ", we can assume that for each generation there is at most only one synonymous mutation , that changes codon @xmath18 to @xmath17 or vice versa .",

    "only the fittest group @xmath113 survives . in this case",
    "all mutations are deleterious , and their effect is to lower the growth rate @xmath96 of the total mass of bacterial population .    at this stage of development ,",
    "our model is too simplified to allow quantitative comparison with experimental data .",
    "however , it can be used as an interpretative tool for the understanding of the mutation / selection dynamics .",
    "in order to estimate the degree of optimization between codons and trna species we have analyzed 1530 _ escherichia coli _ coding regions .    the choice of analyzing mainly the _ e. coli _",
    "coding sequences depends not only on the large amount of data in literature and the large number of genes that have been sequenced ( about 35% of the genome , at this date ) but on the fact that in _ e. coli _ genome the effect of a directional mutational pressure towards an increase in g+c or a+t content is very little ( about 51% g+c content ) , as compared with other organisms like _ micrococcus luteus _",
    "( 74% g+c content ) or _ mycoplasma capricolum _",
    "( 25 % g+c content ) ( sueoka , 1993 ) ( osawa & jukes , 1988b ) .",
    "this pressure , probably due to mutations in the dna polymerase system , acts particularly in shrinking the codon and anticodon sets : in _ e. coli _ there are 75 trna genes , and 45 types of anticodons , while in _ micrococcus luteus _ or _ mycoplasma capricolum _",
    "these numbers are much lower ( 29 and 33 trna genes , resp . ) . besides , the large effects of the directional mutational pressure on genomes composition probably results in weakening other existing functional constraints .    for each gene",
    "we have considered the simple relationship ( [ tau ] ) between codons at position @xmath3 , ( @xmath1 ) and trna molecule abundances ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "we have considered equal translational efficiency for all codons .",
    "the effective trna species abundances at different duplication rates are not exactly known ; little differences in the total trna abundances have been proved experimentally among different strains of _ e. coli _",
    "( jakubowski , 1984 ) , but the relative abundances do not seem to vary largely even among different species of enterobacteria : the data by ikemura show that there is a good correspondence between the relative abundances of the trna species between _ e. coli _ and _ salmonella typhimurium_. thus we have approached the problem performing the calculations in two ways :    \\a ) considering the data on the relative abundances of the trna species published by ikemura ( @xmath115 ) ( ikemura , 1981a ) ( ikemura , 1981b ) ( ikemura , 1985 ) and jakubowski ( jakubowski,1984 ) .",
    "\\b ) using the data on trna gene dosage published by komine ( @xmath116 ) ( komine _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) .",
    "both these two implementations are affected by different approximations .    in case ( a )",
    "the data determined by ikemura are not exhaustive .",
    "we have approximated the abundances of the minor trnas at the value 0.1 with respect to the abundance of leu - trna normalized at 1 . in case ( b ) we have considered the abundance of trna species to be just proportional to the number of trna genes ; this assumption could be not completely true because different trna gene clusters are regulated by different promoters and because of differences in aminoacyl - trna synthetases abundances and catalytic activities .    in fig .",
    "1 we report the average time spent per codon @xmath115 for 1530 coding sequences , both for the correct reading frame and for the + 1 and + 2 reading frames . the sequences are ordered according with the value of @xmath117 of the correct reading frame .    in fig .",
    "2 we report @xmath116 for the same sequences of fig . 1 .",
    "the comparison of the two figures shows that there is a good agreement between the values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , although the data obtained using the distribution of trna abundances from ikemura show a more marked separation between the correct reading frame and the + 1 and + 2 frames .",
    "this indicates that there is a good correspondence between trna abundances and number of copy of the related trna gene , i.e. the most abundant trnas are expressed by triplicated or quadruplicated genes while the less abundant trna species are expressed by genes present in a single copy .    in all the analyzed coding regions",
    ", the correct reading frame always presents the lower crossing times , although the differences are more marked for the highly expressed sets : the mean translation time of the correct reading frame for highly expressed coding regions ( as ribosomal genes , see fig .",
    "1 ) is lower than those calculated for non highly expressed coding regions , while the value for the + 1 and + 2 frames are equal or sometimes greater .",
    "we have also compared our results with the sharp and li s codon adaptation index ( @xmath118 )  of each sequence .",
    "this index does not depend directly on the abundances of trna but it is a measure of the bias in codon usage ( sharp & li , 1987 ) defined as follows    @xmath119    where the product of @xmath120 is taken over the code under examination .",
    "the quantities @xmath121 for a codon @xmath3 at position @xmath6 is given by the relative frequency of the codon @xmath3 with respect to the most used codon for the same aminoacyd in a set of highly expressed genes .",
    "note that in principle is possible to sinthetize artificial sequences made only of major codons with a @xmath118 value greater than that of the most abundant proteins .",
    "this occours because this index neglect the influence of mutations .",
    "the same misunderstanding occours with our quantity @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "3 we report the @xmath118 values for the same sequences of fig .",
    "the agreement with both the @xmath115 and @xmath116 is rather good .",
    "the genes that show a highly biased codon usage have high values of @xmath118 ( and low values of @xmath115 ) and belong to the translation and transcription machinery , as for instance genes coding for ribosomal proteins , initiation and elongation factors , heat shock or stringent response proteins , genes involved in the core of intermediate metabolism and genes coding for the most abundant membrane proteins .    generally the genes whose products are proved to be required for maximal growth rate show high value of @xmath118 .",
    "we can consider for instance the _  _",
    "@xmath122_if2@xmath123 _ and @xmath124_if2@xmath59_(sacerdot _ et al . _ , 1992 ) that operate in the initiation of the translation process and probably affect the production of ribosomal rna , and the product of the _  nusa _ gene that is involved in the transcriptional process .",
    "these three genes are clustered in the same operon , probably for a co - regulation of translation and transcription .",
    "the apices indicate the position of the sequences in the figures .",
    "the dna polymerases i and ii are present in different concentrations ; about 400 molecules of polymerase i per cell with respect to 17 - 100 molecules per cell of polymerase ii ( adams _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath118 values of the two genes ( @xmath125_pola _ and @xmath126_polb _ ) reflect the difference : 0.403 ( @xmath115 = 2.29 ) versus 0.352 ( @xmath127 = 2.89 ) .",
    "since biosynthetic operons are quite constitutively expressed , except during starvation conditions , the genes coding for the repressor proteins show @xmath118 values lower than repressor genes in catabolic operons .    in some cases genes coding for functional aggregates constituted by structural proteins interacting in a precise stoichiometry ratio show values of @xmath118 or @xmath115 close to this ratio .",
    "this relation is true only for highly expressed genes ; for example some ribosomal proteins , as _  _",
    "@xmath128_l7 _ and @xmath129_l20 _ , are present as a tetramer in each ribosome ( adams _ et al . _ , 1992 ) : the @xmath118 value of the correspondent genes are higher than those of other ribosomal genes ; the same correlation has been found for atp synthetases genes that code for a large complex constituted by many copies of different subunits : there is a good agreement between the @xmath118 values of the genes and the stoichiometry of the subunits in the complex .",
    "this correspondence almost vanishes for structural proteins coded by low expressed genes as those coding for fimbriae , pili and flagella .",
    "generally , the enzymes that channel a metabolic pathway do not present the same bias in codon usage , probably because natural selection acts primary on the homogenization of the catalytic activity of the metabolon , however there are also few interesting clues of the contrary .    the membrane lipids biosynthesis in _",
    "e. coli _ involves the action of at least 25 genes ; many of these are clustered in the _",
    "fab _ operon .",
    "although the regulation of this pathway is very complex and not yet completely elucidated , with regard to both the total fatty acid content and the phospholipids composition , there are some observations that indicate that the activities of few enzymes ( acetyl - coa : acp transacetylase , acetyl coa carboxylase ) are rate limiting in vivo ( magnuson _ et al . _ , 1993 ) .",
    "we have found that the bias in codon usage of these genes is higher than that of the genes coding for the other enzymes of the pathway .",
    "since growth rate depends also by membrane lipids production , the bias in the bottleneck of the pathway probably increases the rate of production , while its effect on the other genes is vanishingly small .",
    "other interesting examples regard the relatively high bias in codon usage in genes like @xmath130_spot _ , @xmath131_htpr _ ,",
    "@xmath132_uspa _ , @xmath133_fis _ ,",
    "@xmath134c_spa _ and @xmath135_acka_.    since _ spot _ encodes for a ppgpp pyrophosphohydrolase , it takes into account for the degradation of ppgpp , the major inductor of the stringent response , that accumulates during starvation periods .",
    "nutritional shift - up experiments , in which large amount of nutrients are added to bacteria growing in a minimal medium , have revealed that there are immediate changes in the rate of increase of cell mass while the cell division rate continues for some time at pre - shift rate ( cooper , 1991 ) .",
    "thus the competition among bacteria requires to exit quickly from the starvation periods and to restart growing when conditions have changed ; in this sight the _ spot _ gene ( @xmath118= 0.59 , @xmath115 = 1.4 ) could be a very important target for natural selection .",
    "probably for the same reason the _ htpr _ gene ( @xmath118 = 0.553 , @xmath115 = 1.95 ) has a relatively highly biased codon usage : the encoded protein coordinates the global response of the cell to heat shock events .",
    "in fact this gene codes for a sigma-32 subunit that substitutes the sigma-70 in the core of rna polymerase making the new holoenzyme capable of activating the heat shock promoters .",
    "henceforth other heat shock genes show a biased codon usage as for instance @xmath136_dnaj _ and @xmath137_groel_. the intracellular amount of the universal stress protein , coded by the gene _ uspa _",
    "( @xmath118 = 0.52 , @xmath115 = 2.19 ) , greatly increases in the cases of exhaustion of nutrients like carbon , nitrogen , phosphate , sulfate or aminoacid ( nystrom & neidhardt , 1992 ) .",
    "we hypothesize that codon usage reflects not only the effects of selection for high growth rate conditions but also selection for very fast , and perhaps short time lasting , response to equally rapid environment changes .",
    "a clue that agrees well with this hypothesis concerns the _ fis _ gene ( @xmath118 = 0.53 , @xmath115 = 2.21 ) whose product functions as a dna binding protein , involved in recombination reactions and in rrna transcription .",
    "it has been reported that when the availability of a rich medium allows the bacterial cells to exit from the stationary phase , the amount of the _ fis _ gene product increases from less than 100 copies to over 50000 copies before the first cell division .",
    "as the exponential growth goes on , the fis levels decrease considerably ( ball _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) .",
    "the gene _ cspa _ ( @xmath118 = 0.808 , @xmath115 = 1.81 ) codes for the major cold shock gene ( cs7.4 ) ( tanabe _ et al . _ ,",
    "1992 ) ; when the temperature shifts from 37 @xmath138 to 10 @xmath138 the level of the protein largely increases and becomes about 13% of the total proteins in the bacterial cell .",
    "it is noteworthy that since acetyl phosphate seems to be a global regulator of signal transduction in _",
    "e. coli _ , also the gene _",
    "( @xmath118 = 0.66 , @xmath115 = 1.9 ) that codes for a protein that synthesizes acetyl phosphate from atp and acetate presents a high value of @xmath118 .",
    "there are genes with little if any differences in values of @xmath127 between the correct reading frame and the others .",
    "this is mostly true for genes in plasmids ( see fig .",
    "since plasmids and conjugative transposons play a key role in the interchange of drug resistance and virulence traits among bacteria , and generally in the mobilization of the genetic material , it has been proposed that the entire pool of genetic information could be accessible to all members of the bacterial community , considered as a single , heterogeneous organism . in this regard",
    "the emergence of a bias in codon usage for a gene carried by a plasmid is treated unfairly by natural selection if the rate of the genetic information interchange among conjugative bacteria of different species is sufficiently high .",
    "in fact because of the genetic flux , the plasmid could visit a wide range of hosts , thus it could assay different molecular environments and therefore the recombinant processes between homologous genes maintain sequence homogeneity .",
    "furthermore , an increased expression of a gene could be attained also by increasing the number of copies of the plasmids .",
    "the debate between neutralists and selectionists in evolutionary and population genetics addresses the question of how the superposition and the interactions between the different constraints acting on the coding regions allow the tremendous amount of molecular genetic variation that natural bacteria populations exhibit .    the comparison of the standard deviation of the @xmath118 index for thirteen sequences of d - glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene ( @xmath139_gap _ gene ; average @xmath118 = 0.830 , standard deviation 0.0025 ) from different strains of _ e. coli _ sequenced by selander ( selander _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ) and ten sequences of the alkaline phosphatase gene ( @xmath140_phoa _ gene , @xmath118 = 0.344 , standard deviation 0.0059 ) sequenced by milkman ( dubose & hartl , 1991 ) , shows that genes with higher bias in codon usage present lower levels of silent polymorphism .",
    "this relation suggests that the more biased the codon usage of a gene among a bacteria population , the less neutral the synonymous mutation .",
    "another fundamental question regards if and in what measure the bias in codon usage participates in the control of gene expression .",
    "_ e. coli _ and bacteria in general are governed by robust and plastic regulative mechanisms and even if regulative circuitry are parsimonious in design , the present day gene networks have a large tool - kit of regulative mechanisms , both at the gene - protein and at the protein - protein interaction level .",
    "although the basic mechanisms act at the operon level , there are global mechanisms that allow the cell to respond to challenges , as hunger or stress situations , with the coordinate and concerted expression of a network of operons .",
    "these mechanisms rely mainly in a cascade - like activation of autogenously regulated stimulons or in the sigma subunit variability that makes the polymerases capable of recognizing different types of promoters .    within the operon there are mechanisms that differentiate the expression at the single gene level , as for instance internal promoters , transcription termination signals , ribosome binding sites with different efficiency , mrna degradation signals etc .",
    "although bias in codon usage has been proved to play a role in differentiating the expression levels of the genes within the operon , since these mechanisms act sequentially , the effect of codon bias on the translation process probably depends largely on the optimization of the other factors involved in the gene expression .",
    "the amounts of the genes that present high values of @xmath118 , for instance the ribosomal and major outer membrane genes whose products are strongly required with respect to other proteins for high duplication rates , are the effective fitness bottleneck of the bacterial duplication machinery ; thus the growth maximization strategy allows a cell to duplicate faster because it lowers the time needed for translation .",
    "the natural selection acts so much stronger in optimizing the translation of the very highly expressed genes , with respect the other genes , because further increases in the translation efficiency of these latter genes reflects smaller improvements in the fitness of the cell .",
    "considerations of this type have also been proposed and tested by dykhuizen and collaborators for _ lac _ operon in _",
    "e. coli _ ( dean _ et al .",
    "_ , 1986 ) ; they have demonstrated that the contribution to the fitness of the proteins encoded by the _",
    "operon is quite different , being the bottleneck of the lactose metabolic pathway the flux of lactose into the cell , governed by the concentration of the enzyme lac permease : thus the increase of catalytic activity of the other enzymes coded by the lac operon ( for example beta - galactosidase ) results in a very little increase of the global fitness of the pathway .",
    "this could be a general principle in gene network architecture , i.e. the potentiality of increasing the global fitness of the pathway could not be equally distributed among the genes belonging to a gene network .",
    "being generally accepted that the weaker the selective constraint , the wider the random genetic drift ( li & _  _ graur , 1991 ) , the more relaxed situation of genes whose product are not required in large amount , allows high genetic variability consisting mainly in synonymous substitutions .",
    "we have modeled some aspects of the molecular evolution of bacteria genomes by means of the coupling between codon distributions and trnas abundance and the competitive effects of mutation and selection .",
    "our model is consistent with a thermodynamical interpretation of this process , and gives a matematical support to the observed codon usage distribution .",
    "the evolution of a non synchronized population of bacteria is schematically drawn as alternated phases of exponential growth ( feast ) and selection ( famine ) , due either to starvation or to external reasons . in bacteria , because of the limiting amounts of nutrients and the rapid fluctuation in their availability in natural environment , the periods of growth are sporadic .",
    "indeed , during these sporadic periods , the number of bacterial cells tends to increase exponentially and the competition between genotypes could develop very hardly , because a light difference in the fitness could result in a large difference in number and in the affirmation of the fitter genotype .    probably the two extreme conditions of feast and famine model large part of the fitness function of the bacterial genomes .",
    "bias in codon usage seems to be an adaptive response not only to feast periods but also to conditions of changing surroundings .",
    "in fact to survive famine periods would require sophisticated regulative mechanisms leading to a shrewd management of the resources as for instance the stringent response , while the selection for rapid oscillating periods make the cells maximize the sharp up - shift or down - shift production of some specific proteins . according to this hypothesis , bias in codon usage",
    "has revealed an interesting tool to investigate the fitness bottleneck in metabolic pathways or in gene networks like stringent response .       *",
