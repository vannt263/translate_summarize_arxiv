    "the class of @xmath1spaces includes all lens spaces and is closed under connected sum as well as orientation reversal . according to a theorem of nmethi , a three  manifold obtained as a plumbing of spheres is an @xmath1space if and only if it is the link of a rational surface singularity @xcite .",

    "though there is not yet a classification of @xmath1spaces , there is a complete answer in the case of seifert fibered spaces , according to a theorem of lisca and stipsicz @xcite which states    [ theorem : ls ] let @xmath6 be an oriented seifert fibered rational homology @xmath0sphere with base @xmath7 .",
    "then the following statements are equivalent :    1 .   @xmath6 is an @xmath1space 2 .   either @xmath6 or @xmath8 carries no positive , transverse contact structures 3 .",
    "@xmath6 carries no transverse foliations 4 .",
    "@xmath6 carries no taut foliations .",
    "moreover , the existence of transverse foliations is completely understood and has a simple combinatorial answer given in terms of the seifert invariants , by work of eisenbud , hirsch , jankins , neumann , and naimi ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "what can one say about tight contact structures on the manifolds from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in theorem [ theorem : przy ] ?",
    "the author would like to thank his phd supervisor , peter ozsvth , for his continued guidance and support , and for suggesting the problem .",
    "he would also like to thank joshua greene , adam levine , and helge moller pederson for helpful conversations .",
    "we begin with a review an algorithm that takes a diagram for a knot or link and produces a surgery presentation for its branched double cover , described in @xcite . given a diagram of a link @xmath54 pick an edge at random to mark . then checkerboard color the plane .",
    "this allows us to produce the _ black graph _ of @xmath54 , denoted @xmath55 : it is a planar graph whose vertices are in one - to - one correspondence with the black regions in our checkerboard coloring of the plane , and whose edges correspond to crossings in the diagram .",
    "the edges are further decorated by an incidence number @xmath56 given by the rule of figure [ fig : incidence ] .",
    "the vertices are then weighted by the sum of the incidences of the incident edges @xmath57 .",
    "we then form the _ reduced black graph _ @xmath58 by deleting the vertex which corresponds to the region touching the marked edge and then deleting all edges which are incident to this vertex .",
    "we then draw a surgery diagram as follows : for each vertex of @xmath59 we draw a planar unknot ( such that all are unlinked ) . for each edge between two vertices",
    "we add a right / left  handed clasp between the corresponding unknots according to the incidence of the edge ( see figure [ fig : clasp ] ) or , equivalently , performing @xmath60 surgery on an unknot which links the two components as shown in the figure . if we chose to draw clasps , we frame each unknotted component by the weight on its corresponding vertex . if we chose to draw linking @xmath60 curves",
    ", then we @xmath61frame each of the original unknots coming from the vertices of the reduced black graph .",
    "this gives a surgery presentation for @xmath62 .",
    "see figure [ fig : example ] for an example .",
    "warning : in this paper , we will occasionally work with decorated graphs such as the graph labeled @xmath58 in figure [ fig : example ] .",
    "though asthetically similar , these diagrams are generally not the same as plumbing graphs ( in the sense of @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "there is one exception , however : when our graph is a tree and we delete the edge markings then we actually do have a plumbing description of our manifold .",
    "one may visualize the involution on this manifold , giving rise to our link : line up the @xmath61framed circles on a line and then put in the @xmath60 framed unknots each intersecting the axis of symmetry in @xmath37 points in such a way that the whole diagram has a symmetry about an axis , as shown in the example .",
    "the complement of the surgered solid tori has the obvious branch locus  the axis drawn minus its intersections with the solid tori .",
    "the involution of @xmath20 about this axis may be extended to a hyperelliptic involution of the surgery tori fixing longitudes and meridians setwise ( but reversing their orientation ) .",
    "it s easy to see that the quotient of the complement of the surgery solid tori under the involution is a ball minus a collection of disjoint sub - balls , one for each surgery torus ( for instance , take as fundamental domain the  upper half space \" cut out by half solid tori ) .",
    "this shows that the quotient orbifold is indeed topologically @xmath20 .",
    "we now determine its branch locus .",
    "the branch locus in each of the solid tori is pair of arcs , each of which is isotopic ( rel boundary ) to a  half \" of the corresponding framing curve in the surgery diagram .",
    "for instance , if we only had @xmath63 @xmath61framed curves ( no @xmath60surgeries ) , then the downstairs branch locus coming from the  outside \" ( the complement of the solid tori ) is a collection of @xmath24 arcs in the three  sphere . isotoping the downstairs branch loci ( rel boundary ) of the solid",
    "tori connects these arcs in such a way that we get a collection of @xmath24 unknots . in a similar way",
    ", we can analyze what happens with the introduction of @xmath60 surgeries , as above . by pushing the branch loci into the",
    " outside \" we see that @xmath64 surgeries correspond to the introduction of right  handed  crossings \" between the corresponding unknots from above and that @xmath65 surgeries correspond to the introduction of left  handed crossings .",
    "note that we re not quite working with knot diagrams and crossings  were working with an unlink of some number of some components .",
    "it still makes sense to talk about introducing  crossings \" between components once we chose a path between them : choose a  parallel \" copy of our path by displacing it slightly , keeping the endpoints on the link components . with this framing curve in place",
    ", we can make sense of introducing  crossings \" between components . in our case",
    ", the paths between components along which  crossings \" are added are the images of the cores of the surgery tori . however , in our setting , we actually can interpret this as introducing crossings in a knot diagram ( the plane can be taken to be the image of the half plane in the upper half space which intersects the axis of symmetry and the @xmath61framed unknots union the boundary plane of the upper half space in the quotient ... plus some stuff from the surgered solid tori ) .      in @xcite ozsvth and szab",
    "defined the class of _ quasi  alternating _ links  it is the smallest collection @xmath66 of links such that    * the unknot is in @xmath66 .",
    "* if the link @xmath1 has a diagram with a crossing @xmath67 such that 1 .   both resolutions of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as in figure [ fig : resolutions ] , are in @xmath66 , 2 .",
    "@xmath70 , + then @xmath1 is in @xmath66 .    as in @xcite , we shall call such a crossing @xmath67 as above a _ quasi ",
    "alternating crossing _ of @xmath1 and that @xmath1 is _ quasi  alternating at _ @xmath67 .",
    "the class of quasi - alternating links extends the class of alternating links in the sense that if a link admits a connected alternating diagram then it is quasi  alternating . in @xcite , ozsvth and szab",
    "show that if a link @xmath1 is quasi  alternating , then its branched double cover is an @xmath1space ( though not every @xmath1space arises in such a way , for instance @xmath71 is an example ) .",
    "quasi  alternating knots may be  generated \" by the following construction of kofman and champanerkar ( see @xcite ) .",

    "then @xmath77 is quasi  alternating at any crossing of @xmath74 .",
    "the reason that the branched double cover of a quasi  alternating link in @xmath20 is an @xmath1spaces follows from the following construction of @xmath1spaces ( see @xcite ) . fix a closed , oriented three - manifold @xmath3 and let @xmath78 be a framed knot in @xmath3 .",

    "the discussion in subsection [ section : surgery ] shows that the branched double cover of a link and the branched double covers of its two resolutions at a crossing fit into a triad .",

    "a further consequence of the exact triangle shows that if @xmath84 is a knot in the three - sphere such that @xmath85 is an @xmath1space for some rational number @xmath86 ( with respect to the seifert framing ) then @xmath87 is an @xmath1space for any rational @xmath88 .",
