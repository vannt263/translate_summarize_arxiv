    "dynamic positron emission tomography ( pet ) can be used to measure tracer kinetics in vivo , from which physiological parameters , such as tissue perfusion , ligand receptor binding potential , and metabolic rate can be determined using compartmental modelling techniques .",
    "estimation of the kinetic parametric images can be extremely challenging , since the data are often very noisy .",
    "most conventional methods either define a region of interest ( roi ) and estimate parameters based on the averages@xcite , or in a voxelwise fashion . the former requires the identification of roi which itself is difficult .",
    "the latter fails to utilize information from nearby voxels , resulting in more noisy estimates .",
    "estimations are typically carried out using a minimum least - squares approach @xcite or a basis function approach@xcite . given low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , particularly in voxelwise estimations ,",
    "some external constraints are often necessary to stabilize parameter estimation .",
    "smoothness regularization can be used@xcite , constraining the parameters from nearby spatial locations to be more similar .",
    "similarly , tikhonov regularization @xcite can be used to directly constrain parameter values to be within a certain range , so that estimates obtained are less sensitive to noise . to account for irregularities in the noise distribution",
    ", mixture models can be fitted to each voxel @xcite . in this case , it is necessary to restrict the total number of mixture components to be small and employ regularization to constrain parameter estimates .    assuming a gaussian error distribution , bayesian methods @xcite provide an alternative way of obtaining uncertainty estimates for the kinetic parameters , as well as model choice for the competing compartmental models . however , these methods yield higher voxel to voxel variability because each voxel was processed independently , and the assumption of gaussian distribution can also be inappropriate , leading to biased parameter estimates . this has led to the development of several approaches , in which a clustering method was performed first to cluster the pet images into several homogeneous regions , and kinetic parameter estimations were then performed afterward based on the averaged values of each cluster .",
    "see , for example , hierarchical clustering of the time activity curves ( tacs ) using a weighted dissimilarity measure@xcite , and a comparison of a number of different hierarchical clustering algorithms in this context@xcite .",
    "recently , simultaneous clustering and parameter estimation methods have been proposed using a spatially regularized @xmath1-means algorithm .",
    "the algorithm iteratively estimates the kinetic parameters in a least squared sense between each cluster update@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that incorporating the physiological model in the clustering procedure performed better than their counterparts in terms of clustering .",
    "however , the method offers no guidance on the choice of cluster numbers , or how to select the spatial regularization parameter , both can have great influence on the results .",
    "a similar algorithm was proposed @xcite , where the clustering and parameter estimation were performed simultaneously , although spatial correlation was ignored .",
    "they demonstrated improvements to parameter estimation in myocardial perfusion pet imaging .",
    "we develop a fully bayesian approach , based on defining a finite mixture of multivariate gaussian distributions to model each voxelwise tac .",
    "we consider that there are a number of distinct homogeneous groups of voxel kinetics which tend to be spatially contiguous .",
    "the optimal number of mixture components ( or groups ) is estimated via information theoretic criteria .",

    "additionally , we model the spatial dependence between the tacs via the markov random field ( mrf ) , which allows us to borrow information across nearby voxels .",

    "this paper proposes a novel method , smm , that clusters voxelwise tacs and estimates kinetic parameters simultaneously .",
    "our modelling approach shares similarities to the recently proposed work @xcite , where the mixture model was fitted to each voxel ( while still borrowing information across nearby voxels ) to overcome the issue of non - gaussian error distributions .",
    "we allow several similar voxels to share the same parameter values , since separate mixture models fitted to each voxel introduces too many parameters , and will lead to more estimation uncertainty .",
    "our approach naturally allows us to constrain parameter estimates without the need to specify regularization parameters as in the usual bayesian maximum a posterior ( map ) approaches .",
    "finally , we allow the data to determine the most appropriate number of mixtures to fit to the data .",
    "our model - based approach offers several advantages , compared to other existing statistical approaches described above .",
    "we require minimal user input in the algorithm , preferring to allow the data to dictate the optimal choices .",
    "one benefit of our modelling approach is in the determination of the optimal number of mixture components .",
    "we also automatically compute the value of the smoothing parameter used in the mrf model .",
    "this unknown parameter is difficult to estimate , and in many applications of spatial modelling , the estimation of this parameter has not been carefully considered .",
    "the choice of both these parameters can have a big impact on results , since suboptimal choices will either result in higher bias or higher variance for the resulting parameter estimates .",
    "finally , the bayesian statistical framework allows us to quantify uncertainty probabilistically , since uncertainty in the model and parameters is a natural consequence of our modelling framework .",
    "an efficient mcmc algorithm allows us to provide parameter estimates , as well as uncertainty quantification simultaneously .    in figure",
    "[ bicplot ] , the bic values start to reach a minimum at around @xmath11716 or 17 .",
    "we chose to work with 17 , but higher values of 18 or 19 will work equally well .",
    "these numbers are similar to the number of true segments simulated ; however , we expect that this number can be different depending on the nature of the noise",
    ". figures [ k1plot_g17 ] and [ k2plot_g17 ] indicate the component mean estimates for @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is difficult to make direct correspondences between the clusters we obtained with the true segments .",
    "the first four components correspond mostly to noise , the next four components correspond mostly to abnormal voxels and the rest belong to normal voxels .",
    "the discrepancy between the estimated values of @xmath0 and the truth is most obvious in the abnormal region , this is possibly a combination of partial volume effect , as well as misclassification of the normal voxels . given that smm outperforms the other two methods in the abnormal region , we believe similar issues with the data are affecting the other two methods also .",
    "despite the fact that it is difficult to make sense of individual clusters , aggregating the clusters can provide us with information about the larger rois .",
    "for instance , if we are interested in identifying the three regions of noise , abnormal and normal , we can aggregate the clusters according to @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "a similar procedure can be used to classify the regions using the results from scf and skms . in terms of misclassification rates ,",
    "based on a single simulation data set , smm classified 96.34% of noise voxels correctly , compared to 94.43% and 87.60% for scf and skms .",
    "the misclassified voxels for smm were all assigned to the abnormal voxels , this corresponds to the first four clusters in figure [ k1plot_g17 ] . for the other two methods",
    ", they were spread between abnormal and normal voxels . for the abnormal region ,",
    "smm had a 100% correct classification , while this was only 62.68% for scf and 52.82% for skms .",
    "all of the misclassifications in scf and skms were allocated to noise .",
    "finally , for the normal region , smm , scf and skms had 69.57% , 73.49% and 58.99% respectively for correct classifications , most of the misclassifications were found to be allocated to the abnormal region .    in terms of @xmath6 estimation",
    ", smm is clearly better than the other two methods .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figures [ kbias ] and [ petereu ] .",
    "skms performed the worst , particularly in the abnormal and noise regions , their parameter estimation can be prone to very large biases . in the noise region , in particular , the median mean squared bias was around 2.96 , while the other two methods were close to 0 . putting constraints on these parameters may prove useful .    for @xmath0 estimates ,",
    "skms was marginally worse than the other two methods in terms of mean squared bias . in the abnormal region , smm shows noticeably superior performance , where it can be seen in figure [ kbias ] , top row , the entire distribution of smm is closer toward 0 than the other two methods .",
    "the difference in the normal region is less obvious .",
    "the third row in figure [ kbias ] shows the biases in the noise region ; here , since smm set @xmath0 in this region to 0 , the graph can be interpreted by looking separately at the values of mean squared bias below @xmath121 and above . on average , voxels with bias greater than this value",
    "are essentially misclassified , i.e. , they should be singled out as noise , but instead have significant values for the kinetic parameters . for smm",
    ", there was an average misclassification rate of 3.66% , for scf it is 5.71% and 11.65% for skms .",
    "scf has the largest mean squared biases here , going up to 3.32 , while the other two methods remain around 0.2 .    in terms of the standard deviations of the bias",
    ", smm performed the best , while scf was the worst .",
    "the plot in the last row of figure [ kbias ] shows that for @xmath0 , the range for scf goes up to 1.7 , while for smm and skms , this was only 0.34 and 0.63 respectively .",
    "in fact , 15% of the voxels estimated by scf was greater than 0.34 ( the largest value obtained by smm ) , and 0.8% from skms .",
    "the proposed method is clearly superior in terms of robustness , indicated by the substantially smaller standard deviation estimates , as can be seen in both figure [ kbias ] and figure [ petereu ] .",
    "it also performed at least as good as , and sometimes better than the other two methods in terms of mean squared bias . in the single slice plot in figure [ petereu ] , where the mean of the raw biases was plotted , it is difficult to distinguish between the three methods .",
    "this is due to the fact that when raw biases are averaged , they will go toward zero as the effects of the large positive and negative biases cancel out .",
    "this will be true for all unbiased estimators regardless of how sensitive the estimations are to noise . in this sense ,",
    "it is more useful to look at the mean squared or absolute biases .    in terms of the estimation of the pig study data , it was not possible to compare the bias and standard deviations of the biases because the ground truth was not known . however , the parametric images shown in figure [ petereupig ] suggest that much smoother @xmath0 and @xmath6 images were produced by smm compared to scf .",
    "the white color in the @xmath0 images indicates a value close to 1 , which is the upper bound of the artificial constraint we used .",
    "it is clear from the figure that many values produced by the scf method were simply truncated at this value .",
    "smm estimation produced significantly less values close to the upper bound .",
    "the upper bound of 1 for @xmath0 is essentially arbitrary .",
    "for smm estimation , if we remove this bound , we obtain two groups of voxels with physiologically implausibly high @xmath0 values whilst the rest of the voxel estimates remains unchanged , well below 1 .",
    "however , in terms of the scf estimation , raising the bounds to higher than 1 produced many more voxels between 1 and 2 .",
    "however , since this was a resting pig , where the mean blood flow at rest is around 0.65 ml / min / cc , we do not expect flow to be above 1 at rest , so the scf results with higher bounds would be difficult to interpret , since the higher values could also be due to spill - over from blood - pools , or voxels actually containing blood or noise .    in terms of computation , it took about 4 hours to complete all 6000 iterations for each noise realization of simulated data , using matlab r2014b , running on a single node of the linux computational cluster katana at unsw , australia .",
    "this is equivalent to running on an average pc .",
    "the total number of voxels was 5746 .",
    "we found that all the parameters converged quite quickly .",
    "for scf and skms , the computational time was around 1 minute .",
    "for the pig study data involving 16821 voxels , and a longer time series involving 29 time points , the computational times were 23.5 hours and 6 hours for smm and scf respectively .",
    "we note that although smm is computationally more expensive , it provides additional uncertainty estimation , which the other two faster methods do not .",
    "parallel computation or other computational methods , such as variational bayes @xcite , can be adopted to further speed up this process .    in the future",
    ", there are three directions to be considered to further develop our approach .",
    "first , we can relax the within cluster homogeneity assumption .",
    "this is easily achievable by relaxing the mean of the normal mixture to allow them to vary for each voxel observation .",
    "however , this substantially increases the number of parameters that needs to be estimated and presents a computational challenge .",
    "second , we can consider the use of sinogram data rather than reconstructed data to estimate kinetic parameters , and this can reduce the additional noise introduced through the reconstruction step ; however , this approach can be computationally challenging for full bayesian analyses .",
    "third , given its flexibility , smm can be easily extended to more advanced kinetic models , such as the two - compartment tissue model without too much modification .",
    "although we assess performance using simulations of cardiac perfusion pet imaging and demonstrate in vivo data for this application , our approach is not limited to this specific context and may also benefit other dynamic pet procedures as well as dynamic spect , dynamic contrast enhanced ct ( dce - ct ) , and dynamic contrast enhanced mr ( dce - mr ) .",
    "this paper proposed a novel spatiotemporal approach , smm , to infer parametric pet images . by borrowing information from nearby voxels , smm can be used to simultaneously estimate kinetic parameters and classify voxels with similar kinetic parameters into spatially homogeneous groups .",
    "we adopted the mrf to incorporate the spatial dependence of voxels .",
    "we developed an efficient mcmc algorithm for the computation , which estimates all unknown parameters , including the notoriously difficult spatial smoothness parameter @xmath30 in the potts model .",
    "the method provides parameter uncertainty estimation , as well as a principled way to determine the optimal number of voxel groups .",
    "we used simulated cardiac perfusion pet data to evaluate the performance of smm and compared them with scf and skms .",
    "smm was substantially less sensitive to noise than the other methods , it also yielded an overall smaller bias than scf and skms . in the pig study data",
    ", smm was shown to produce smoother parametric images compared to the standard curve fitting .",
    "although simulation and experimental data were based on cardiac pet studies of a one - compartment model , the approach may benefit other dynamic pet procedures , as well as more complex compartmental models .",
