    "the measurement of high energy photo and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) exclusive production of @xmath0 serves as an important testing ground for checking the validity of pqcd in the limit of a relatively small hardness and small @xmath1 .",
    "the hardness of this process is fixed by @xmath2 , consequently@xcite@xcite@xcite it is a suitable means of investigating the applicability and possible need for a re - formulation of hard pqcd when approaching the kinematic interface with the less understood npqcd soft domain .",
    "indeed , over the past few years we have been witness to vigorous experimental , phenomenological and theoretical investigations of this process , which supplement the detailed analysis of @xmath3 , the proton structure function , and its logarithmic derivatives in the small @xmath4 and small @xmath1 limits . +    in the following we present a detailed study of @xmath0 photo and dis exclusive production .",
    "being relatively well measured , it may help to check the self consistency of , and discriminate between , relevant theoretical models .",
    "we recall that a key ingredient for determining the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) is the pqcd analysis of inclusive dis which utilizes the dglap evolution equations@xcite .",
    "these pdfs are then used as input for the pqcd calculation of exclusive dis channels ( such as @xmath0 production ) , which are usually executed in the color dipole approximation@xcite .",
    "we shall mainly be interested in the correlated problems of determining the gluon saturation scale , the role of screening corrections ( sc ) and the relative importance of the soft npqcd component at the kinematic edge where the hard pqcd is applicable .",
    "+    as we shall specify in the next section , a realistic calculation of @xmath0 photo and dis production depends on a few corrections to the original pqcd estimate : +    \\1 ) @xmath5 accounting for the real part of the production amplitude@xcite .",

    ", it accounts for the deviations from the simple static non relativistic estimate of the vector meson wave function .",
    "+    these corrections contribute significantly to the final ( amplitude squared ) estimate .",
    "thus , in our investigation we shall assess possible ambiguities in our calculations which may be associated with the estimated corrections to the bare pqcd calculation .",
    "our analysis follows the same lines as those of our recent paper@xcite on @xmath8 .",
    "the procedure for calculating the forward differential cross section for photo and dis production of a heavy vector meson in the color dipole approximation is straightforward .",
    "the calculation is performed@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in the lla , assuming the produced vector meson quarkonium system to be non relativistic .",
    "the contribution of pqcd to the imaginary part of the @xmath9 differential cross section of photo and dis production of heavy vector mesons is given by [ q ] @xmath10_t=0^pqcd= @xmath11 ^ 2 @xmath12 , where , @xmath13 is the gluon distribution function as obtained from the dglap analysis . in the non relativistic limit",
    "we have @xmath14 in the following we discuss the photo and dis production of @xmath0 as there is an abundance of data available in this channel @xcite@xcite@xcite spanning a relatively wide energy range . from a theoretical point of view , its hardness is comparable to those we have investigated in our @xmath8 analysis@xcite . in this study",
    "we have shown that the recent hera data on the @xmath4 logarithmic slope of @xmath15 is well reproduced by dglap with either the cteq5hq pdf input@xcite , or by the grv98nlo input@xcite which is corrected for sc@xcite . as we wish to maintain the compatibility of the @xmath15 and the @xmath0 production interpretations , we have confined our pqcd calculations only to the above two pdfs . in order to compare with the experimental data , which are given as integrated cross sections , to",

    "theoretically , each of the models we shall consider has a somewhat different estimate of @xmath16 which we shall specify . +    the main difficulty with a pqcd analysis of @xmath0 is the observation that the simple dipole calculation needs to be corrected for the following reasons : +    \\1 ) a correction for the contribution of the real part of the production amplitude .",

    "this correction is calculated@xcite to be k_g^2= @xmath20 ^ 2.[rg ] 3 ) a more controversial issue relates to the non relativistic approximation assumed for the @xmath0 charmonium .",
    "relativistic effects , produced by the fermi motion of the bound quarks , result in a considerable reduction of the calculated pqcd cross section@xcite .",
    "the correction , @xmath7 , is very sensitive to the value of @xmath21 .",
    "ref.@xcite assumes that @xmath22 and obtains @xmath23 with almost no energy dependence",
    ". however , we note that the calculation of @xmath7 , regardless of its detailed construction , is very sensitive to the c - quark mass since a small change in the input value of @xmath21 changes the estimate of @xmath7 significantly . clearly , if we assume that @xmath24 , i.e. a change of only about @xmath25 relative to the value assumed in ref.@xcite , the fermi correcting factor is identical to 1 .",
    "we will , therefore , consider @xmath7 as a free ( energy independent ) parameter .",
    "as we shall see , a calculation based on cteq5 gives @xmath26 , whereas a calculation based on grv98 with sc gives @xmath27 .",
    "this value corresponds to a c - quark mass of approximately @xmath28 .",
    "+    based on the above , the expression for the integrated cross section is written [ nsc ] ( ^ * p j / p)= k_r^2 k_g^2 k_f^2 @xmath29_t=0^pqcd , where @xmath30 is given by , b ( the forward differential slope ) is taken from the data and @xmath7 is a free parameter .",

    "we conclude that cteq5nsc does not produce a good fit to the complete data base .",

    "our expression for @xmath48 , the damping in the gluon sector , is the square of the gluon damping used in refs.@xcite@xcite .",

    "+    as is visible from fig.2 , the suppression induced by the sc is appreciable even though @xmath54 , i.e. below gluon saturation .",
    "this is consistent with the general observation@xcite that sc , which are the consequence of high gluon density , precede the gluon saturation state .",
    "note that @xmath55 , which is the essential parameter in the sc calculation presented both in ref.@xcite and here , is not a free parameter but is determined directly from the @xmath0 photo production forward slope . in a sc model , such as ours , we expect@xcite a weak dependence of @xmath16 on x. this is demonstrated in fig.4 together with the relevant hera data . for a non screened calculation @xmath16 is fixed at @xmath56 .",
    "+    \\3 ) donnachie and landshoff ( dl ) have followed their @xmath15 analysis@xcite with an updated publication on charm production@xcite in which they show that the @xmath0 photo and dis data on the integrated and differential cross sections are compatible with their model , which we denote dl2p .",
    "we discuss the differences between dl2p and the predictions of cteq5nsc and grv98sc in the next section .",
    "the results of the present investigation corroborate the conclusions obtained in our previous study@xcite of @xmath8 , where we have shown that the available data is consistent with either cteq5nsc , grv98sc or dl2p in the kinematic range of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "a comparison of the photo production ( @xmath59 ) predictions of these models over a wide @xmath1 range is presented in fig.5 . following are some concluding remarks +    \\1 ) the differences between cteq5nsc and grv98sc , within the available experimental kinematic window , are relatively small .",
    "we note , though , a systematic difference at low energies ( @xmath60 ) where cteq5nsc is considerably larger than grv98sc .",
    "this difference is responsible for the high @xmath36 values we found for cteq5nsc .",
    "similar differences also exist for the @xmath4 logarithmic slope predictions of these models@xcite in the low energy ( high @xmath1 ) limit , but relevant data is not available . from the study of @xmath0 photo production",
    "we conclude that the grv98sc parameterization of this process extrapolates well to the very low energy domain in which the soft ( npqcd ) sector plays an increasingly important role . on the other hand , cteq5nsc does not have this property and it overestimates the low energy data .",
    "+    \\2 ) we also note a difference between cteq5nsc and grv98sc in the high energy region ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this was not observed in our predictions for the logarithmic @xmath15 slope and is attributed to our approximate calculation of @xmath62 which results in a small excess of the sc for very small @xmath1 . as we noted earlier ,",
    "an exact calculation of @xmath62 will improve the results of grv98sc and bring it close to those of cteq5nsc .",
    "+    \\3 ) as we have shown , cteq5nsc provides an acceptable reproduction of the high energy photo production data .",
    "these results are obtained with @xmath35 which implies that the @xmath0 charmonium bound system is strictly non relativistic , or else , that the normalization of the calculation requires some adjustment .",
    "we have further investigated this model by applying sc to the calculation with @xmath63 , denoting it cteq5sc .",
    "our output is non satisfactory as it systematically underestimates the data .",
    "this result supports our suggestion@xcite that cteq5 may contain significant screening effects which are absent in the boundary conditions used in grv98 . in this context , it is suggestive to assume that cteq5sc results are too small due to a possible double counting of the sc .",
    "our calculated sc introduce a @xmath64 deficiency at @xmath65 .",
    "we consider this as the uncertainty in the cteq5 parameterization in the exceedingly small @xmath1 limit .",
    "this is compatible with the similar conclusion reached in ref.@xcite .",
    "the pqcd calculation used in this investigation is performed in the lla and is , thus , subject to corrections .",
    "we distinguish between the normalization of the models we have discussed , which may change , and their hardness as reflected in the energy , or @xmath1 , dependence , which is a more stable property .",
    "+    \\4 ) within the available kinematic photo production window , dl2p predictions which differ somewhat from the results of the two pqcd models , still provide an adequate reproduction of the data@xcite . at this stage , with the given experimental error bars , one can not conclusively exclude any of these models . at higher energies",
    "dl2p is significantly larger than either cteq5nsc or grv98sc .",
    "this feature of dl2p is a consequence of the hard pomeron component which has a very high regge trajectory intercept . as a result",
    "its energy dependence is much harder than the pqcd models whose @xmath18 values are considerably smaller .",
    "this is clearly seen at @xmath66 where the dl prediction is about 5 times larger than that of grv98sc .",
    "this @xmath1 range will become accessible at thera and , thus , enable an experimental discrimination between dl2p and the pqcd models .",
    "the same behaviour of dl2p has also been observed@xcite in the small @xmath1 limit of @xmath8 .",
    "+    \\5 ) we have investigated the possible role of a soft component , parameterized in the dl form , which was added to grv98sc .",
    "our analysis shows that such an addition does not improve the @xmath36 .",
    "we , thus , conclude that any soft component in our model is exceedingly small .",
    "+    \\6 ) the three models discussed have different predictions for @xmath16 , the @xmath0 forward differential slope .",
    "cteq5nsc is a model with only a hard , non modified , sector . as such",
    ", we expect its @xmath16 to be a constant for which we took the experimental value .",
    "grv98sc is also a model with only a hard sector but it is corrected by sc . as a result , the model predicts a modest shrinkage of @xmath16 which is presented together with the data in fig.4 .",
    "dl2p is a sum of a soft component , which dominates in the low energy limit and a hard component which dominates in the high energy limit .",
    "since the two pomerons have different trajectory slopes , dl2p predicts an anti shrinkage effect , where @xmath16 decreases monotonically with w. the recent zeus@xcite results contradict this feature .",
    "+    overall , our investigation shows that grv98sc results in a better reproduction of the data than the other two models considered .",
