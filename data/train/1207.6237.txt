    "this paper concerns the aperiodic hexagonal mono - tilings created by joan taylor .",
    "we learned about these tilings from the unpublished ( but available online ) paper of joan taylor @xcite , the extended paper of socolar and taylor @xcite , and a talk given by uwe grimm at the kias conference on aperiodic order in september , 2010 @xcite .",
    "these tilings are in essence regular hexagonal tilings of the plane , but there are two forms of marking on the hexagonal tile ( or if one prefers , the two sides of the tile are marked differently ) .",
    "we refer to this difference as * parity * ( and eventually distinguish the two sides as being sides @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) , and in terms of parity the tilings are aperiodic .",
    "in fact the parity patterns of tiles created in this way are fascinating in their apparent complexity , see fig .",
    "[ paritypattern ] and fig .",
    "[ st - whole - tiling ] .        the two taylor ",
    "socolar tiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ two - basic - tiles ] , the main features being the black lines , one of which is a stripe across the tile , and the three colored diameters , one of which is split in color .",
    "the difference in the two tiles is only in which side of the color - split diameter the stripe crosses . in the figure",
    "the tiles are colored white and gray to distinguish them , but it is the crossing - color of the black stripe that is the important distinguishing feature .",
    "socolar tilings can be defined by following simple matching rules ( * r1 , r2 * ) and can also be constructed by substitution ( the scaling factor being @xmath9 ) . in this paper",
    "it is the matching rules that are of importance .",
    "* the black lines must join continuously when tiles abut ; * the ends of the diameters of two hexagonal tiles that are separated by an edge of another tile must be of opposite colors , fig .",
    "[ rule2 ] .",
    "the paper @xcite emphasizes the tilings from the point of view of matching rules , whereas @xcite emphasizes substitution ( and the half - hex approach ) .",
    "there is a slight mis - match between the two approaches , see @xcite , which we will discuss later .",
    "if one looks at part of a tiling with the full markings of the tiles made visible , then one is immediately struck by how the black line markings of the tiles assemble to form nested equilateral triangles , see fig .",
    "[ st - whole - tiling ] .",
    "although these triangles are slightly shrunken ( which ultimately is important ) , we see that basically the vertices of the triangles are tied to the centers of the hexagons , and the triangle side - lengths are @xmath10 in suitable units .",
    "this triangle pattern is highly reminiscent of the square patterns that underlie the famous robinson tilings @xcite which also appear in sizes which scale up by factors of @xmath9 .",
    "these tilings are limit - periodic tilings and can be described by model sets whose internal spaces are @xmath9-adic spaces .",
    "the taylor - socolar tilings are also limit - periodic and it seems natural to associate some sort of @xmath9-adic spaces with them and to give a model - set interpretation of the picture .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to do this , and it has the natural consequence that the tilings are pure point diffractive .",
    "it is convenient to base the entire study on a fixed standard hexagonal tiling of the coordinate plane @xmath11 .",
    "the centers of the hexagonal tiles can then be interpreted as a lattice in the plane ( with one center at @xmath12 ) .",
    "the internal space of the cut and project scheme that we shall construct is based on a @xmath9-adic completion @xmath13 of the group @xmath0 consisting of all translation vectors between the centers of the hexagons .",
    "we shall show that there is a precise one - to - one correspondence between triangulations and elements of @xmath2 .",
    "but the triangulation is not the whole story .",
    "the set of all taylor ",
    "socolar tilings associated with a fixed standard hexagonal tiling of the plane form a tiling hull @xmath1 .",
    "this hull is a dynamical system ( with group @xmath0 ) and carries the standard topology of tiling hulls .",
    "each tiling has an associated triangulation , but the mapping @xmath14 so formed , while generically @xmath15 , is not globally @xmath15 .",
    "what lies behind this is the question of backing up from the triangulations to the actual tilings themselves .",
    "the question is how are the tile markings deduced from the triangulations so as to satisfy the rules * r1 , r2 * ?",
    "there are two aspects to this .",
    "the triangulations themselves are based on hexagon centers , whereas in an actual tiling the triangles are shrunken away from vertices .",
    "this shrinking moves the triangle edges and is responsible for the off - centeredness of the black stripe on each hexagon tile .",
    "how is this shrinking ( or edge shifting , as we call it ) carried out ?",
    "the second feature is the coloring of the diagonals of the hexagons .",
    "what freedom for coloring exists , given that the coloring rule * r2 * must hold ?    in this paper we explain this and give a complete description of the hull and the mapping @xmath16 , theorem  [ minimal ] .",
    "there are numerous places at which @xmath16 is singular ( not bijective ) ; in fact the set of singular points in @xmath2 is dense .",
    "two special classes of singular points are those corresponding to the central hexagon triangulations ( * cht*)(see fig .  [ cht - tiling ] ) and the infinite concurrent @xmath17-line tilings ( *",
    "icw - l * ) ( see fig .  [ icw - l - tiling ] ) . in both cases",
    "there is @xmath18-fold rotational symmetry of the _ triangulation _ and in both cases the mapping @xmath16 is many - to - one .",
    "these two types of tilings play a significant role in @xcite .",
    "the hull has a minimal invariant component of full measure and this is a single li class .",
    "there are two additional orbits , whose origins are the * icw - l * triangulations , and although they perfectly obey the matching rules they are not in the same li class as all the other tilings .",
    "on the other hand the * cht * tilings ( those lying over the * cht * triangulations ) are in the main li class and , because of the particular simplicity of the unique one whose center is @xmath12 , the question of describing the parity ( which tiles are facing up and which are facing down ) becomes particularly easy . here",
    "we reproduce the parity formula for this * cht * tiling as given in @xcite ( with some minor modifications in notation ) .",
    "we use this to give parity formulas for all the tilings of @xmath1 .",
    "a couple of comments about earlier work on aperiodic hexagonal tilings are appropriate here .",
    "d.  frettlh @xcite discusses the half - hex tilings ( created out of a simple substitution rule ) and proves that natural point sets associated with these can be expressed as model sets .",
    "half - hexes do nt play an explicit role in this paper , though the hull of the half - hex tilings is a natural factor of @xmath1 lying between @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "they were important to taylor s descriptions of her tilings and are implicitly embedded in them .    in @xcite ,",
    "roger penrose gives a fine introduction to aperiodic tilings and then goes on to create a class of aperiodic hexagonal tilings , which he calls @xmath19-tilings in which there are three types of tiles that assemble by matching rules .",
    "the main tiles are hexagonal , with keyed edges .",
    "the other two are a linear - like tile with an arbitrarily small width ( @xmath20 tiles ) which fit along the hexagon edges , and some very tiny tiles ( @xmath21 ) which fit at the corners of the tiles .",
    "clearly his objective was to create a single tile that only tiles aperiodically , although that was not achieved in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , however , penrose did find a solution to the problem that uses a single hexagonal tile with matching rules for the edges and corners , @xcite .",
    "this has only recently become more widely known after joan taylor s work started to circulate .",
    "one can quibble about whether or not taylor s tiling stretches the concept of matching rules since the second rule relates non - adjacent tiles and also in her tiling there are two tiles , though ( at least in the right markings ) they are mirror images of each other .",
    "however , the tilings of penrose and taylor tilings are a fascinating pair . extensive computational work of f.  ghler indicates that the two tilings are quite distinct from one another , though they both have @xmath2 as a factor and apparently both have the same dynamical zeta functions @xcite .",
    "there is an algorithmic computation for determining that certain classes of substitution tilings have pure - point spectrum .",
    "it has been used to confirm that the taylor ",
    "socolar substitution tilings have pure point spectrum or , equivalently , are regular model sets @xcite .",
    "in principle the tilings that we are interested in are not connected to the points of lattices and their cosets in @xmath11 , but are only point sets that arise in euclidean space @xmath22 as the vertices and centers of tilings . however , our objective here to realize tiling vertices in an algebraic context and for that we need to fix an origin and a coordinate system so as to reduce the language to that of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the triangular lattice in @xmath11 defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a lattice containing @xmath0 as sublattice of index @xmath18 , see fig .  [ hex ] .",
    "for future reference we note that @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( red and blue points ) in which @xmath0 lies with index @xmath18 .",
    "the points of @xmath0 may be viewed as the vertices of a triangularization of the plane by equilateral triangles of side length @xmath8 .",
    "the red points are the centres of these triangles .",
    "the color here has nothing to do with the coloring of the diagonals of the tiles  it only distinguishes the two cosets.,width=340 ]    joining the points of @xmath0 that lie at distance @xmath8 from one another creates a triangular tiling . inside each of the unit triangles so formed",
    "there lies a point of @xmath31 , and indeed @xmath31 consists of three @xmath0 cosets : @xmath0 itself , the centroids of the `` up '' triangles ( those with a vertex above a horizontal edge ) , and the  down \" triangles ( those with a vertex below a horizontal edge ) , see fig .",
    "what we aim to do is to create a hexagonal tiling of @xmath11 .",
    "when this tiling is complete , the points of @xmath0 will be the centers of the hexagonal tiles and the points of @xmath31 immediately surrounding the points of @xmath0 will make up the vertices of the tiles .",
    "are distance @xmath8 apart and the short diameters of the hexagons are of length @xmath8 while the edges of the hexagons are of length @xmath32 .",
    "the main diagonals of the hexagons are of length @xmath33 in the directions of @xmath34 .",
    "one notes that each of these vectors of @xmath31 is also of length @xmath35 . ]",
    "each of the hexagonal tiles will be marked by colored diagonals and a black stripe , see fig .",
    "[ two - basic - tiles ] .",
    "these markings divide the tiles into two basic types , and it is describing the pattern made from these two types in model - set theoretical terms that is a primary objective of this paper ( see fig .",
    "[ st - whole - tiling ] ) .",
    "the other objective is to describe the dynamical hull that encompasses all the tilings that belong to the taylor ",
    "socolar tiling family .     of @xmath0 and the generators @xmath36 of @xmath31 , showing how the cosets of @xmath0 in @xmath31 split into the points of @xmath0 and the centroids ( centers ) of the up and down triangles . around the point",
    "@xmath37 we see the hexagonal tile centered on @xmath4 with vertices in @xmath38.,width=226 ]    we let the coset of up ( respectively down ) points be denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively : @xmath41    there are three cosets of @xmath0 in @xmath31 . in our construction of the triangle patterns we have taken the point of view that @xmath0 itself will be used for triangle vertices and the other two cosets for triangle centroids .",
    "however , we could use any of the three cosets as the triangle vertices and arrive at a similar situation .",
    "this amounts to a translation of the plane by @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "we come back to this point in  [ parityhull ] .",
    "we now wish to re - triangularize the plane still using points of @xmath0 as vertices , but this time making triangles of side length equal to @xmath9 using as vertices a coset of @xmath44 in @xmath0 .",
    "there are four cosets of @xmath44 in @xmath0 and they lead to four different ways to make the triangularization . fig .",
    "[ cosets ] shows the four types of triangles of side length @xmath9 .",
    "the lattices generated by the points of any one of these triangles is a coset of @xmath44 and together they make up all four cosets of @xmath44 in @xmath0 .",

    "the centroids of the new triangles are a subset of the original set of centroids and , in fact , together with the vertices @xmath47 they form the coset @xmath48 .",
    "this is explained in the fig .",
    "[ newcentres ] , which also explains the important fact that the new centroids , namely those of the new edge - length-@xmath9 triangles of @xmath49 , make up two cosets of @xmath44 in @xmath50 depending on the orientation of the new triangles , and these orientations are _ opposite _ to those that these points originally had .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath51 ( which is in @xmath52 ! ) , @xmath53 ( which is in @xmath54 ) , and the coset decomposition @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "triangles ( indicated with solid red dots ) are obtained as vectors from @xmath58 .",
    "the two @xmath44-cosets of @xmath58 which are not @xmath49 itself indicate the centroids of the new up and down triangles .",
    "notice that the orientations of the new triangles , and hence the orientations associated with the new centroids , are opposite to the orientations associated with these points when they were viewed as centroids of the original triangulation .",
    "this explains why @xmath56 and @xmath57 .,width=226 ]    we now repeat this whole process .",
    "there are four cosets of @xmath59 in @xmath45 and we select one of them , say @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , and this gives us a new triangulation with triangles of side length @xmath62 .",
    "their centroids in @xmath63 form @xmath59-cosets @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and we have the decomposition @xmath66    continuing this way we obtain @xmath67 with @xmath68 , and sets @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 for all @xmath72 , and the partition @xmath73    we have @xmath74 explicit formulas for @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given in lemma  [ sfunctions ] .",
    "we now carry out the entire construction based on an arbitrary infinite sequence @xmath77 where @xmath68 for all @xmath78 .",
    "this results in a pattern of overlapping triangulations based on triangles of edge lengths @xmath10 ( these are referred to as being triangles of levels @xmath79 ) . in  [ tilings ] we shall make our tiling out of this pattern .",
    "but certain features of the entire pattern are clear :    * all points involved as vertices of triangles are in @xmath0 ; * all triangle centroids are in @xmath38 ; * there is no translational symmetry .",
    "the last of these is due to the fact that there are triangles of all scales , and no translation can respect all of these scales simultaneously .",
