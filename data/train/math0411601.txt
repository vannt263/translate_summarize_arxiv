    "topologically , in spite of being contractible , @xmath0 is not homeomorphic to @xmath9 , since its fundamental group at infinity is nontrivial .",
    "now consider the @xmath10-fold product @xmath11 .",
    "this is still of log general type , in particular not isomorphic to @xmath12 as an algebraic variety .",
    "however , for @xmath13 the fundamental group at infinity becomes trivial , and as a consequence @xmath2 is diffeomorphic to @xmath3 ; indeed , dimca [ unpublished ] observed that any contractible affine variety of complex dimension @xmath14 is diffeomorphic to @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the smooth manifolds @xmath3 , @xmath13 , admit nonstandard algebraic variety structures .",
    "the aim of the present note is to consider this phenomenon from the symplectic perspective .",
    "we will equip @xmath0 with an exhausting plurisubharmonic function @xmath16 , which makes it into a stein manifold of finite type , and consider the associated symplectic form @xmath17 ( for this and related terminology , see sections [ sec : def ] and [ sec : essential ] ) .",
    "on @xmath2 we take the product structure .",
    "[ th : main ] for all @xmath10 , @xmath2 can not be symplectically embedded into a subcritical stein manifold .",
    "in particular , for @xmath13 we obtain a symplectic structure on @xmath3 which is exotic ( in the usual sense , of not admitting an embedding into the standard @xmath3 ) .",
    "any sufficiently large relatively compact part of @xmath0 is exotic in the same sense , because of the finite type property ( cf .",
    "lemma [ th : weinstein - embed ] and lemma [ th : stupid ] below ) .",
    "there is a consequence which can be stated purely in terms of stein geometry , answering a question of eliashberg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 3 ) :    [ th : cor ] for all @xmath10 , any exhausting plurisubharmonic morse function on @xmath2 must have at least @xmath18 critical points .",
    "it seems appropriate to compare theorem [ th : main ] with some other known results .",
    "there are several constructions of exotic symplectic structures on @xmath19 for @xmath20 , starting with the abstract existence theorem of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 0.4.@xmath21 ) .",
    "however , in contrast to our example , the resulting symplectic forms are not known to be convex at infinity ; in fact , at least one construction @xcite is explicitly designed to violate that condition . in a somewhat different direction",
    ", we should mention that eliashberg @xcite has given candidates , by an explicit lagrangian handle decomposition , for stein _ subdomains _ of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which are diffeomorphic to balls , and for which he conjectures that the conclusion of corollary [ th : cor ] still holds .",
    "the main result of @xcite asserts that @xmath7 is the only algebraic surface which is contractible _ and _ simply - connected at infinity .",
    "the symplectic counterpart of this is the observation that ( assuming the @xmath18-dimensional poincar conjecture ) any @xmath24-dimensional weinstein manifold which is contractible , simply connected at infinity , complete , and of finite type , is symplectically isomorphic to standard @xmath9 .",
    "the proof relies on the uniqueness of tight contact structures on @xmath25 @xcite and the description of stein fillings of this structure via families of holomorphic discs @xcite .",
    "moreover , the picture changes if one drops the finite type condition : gompf @xcite has used a suitable infinite handlebody decomposition to produce stein structures on uncountably many manifolds homeomorphic , but not diffeomorphic , to @xmath9 .",
    "the essential ingredient in our proof of theorem [ th : main ] is a particular lagrangian torus @xmath26 , described below . by a careful study of pseudo - holomorphic discs , and invoking a theorem of chekanov @xcite , we show that @xmath26 can not be displaced from itself by a hamiltonian isotopy",
    ". more generally , if @xmath27 is a symplectic embedding into a complete stein manifold , then @xmath28 has the same non - displaceability property .",
    "this , together with the corresponding facts for products @xmath29 , leads easily to theorem [ th : main ] .    the heart of the argument involves considering two different compactifications @xmath30 and @xmath31 of @xmath0 .",
    "the complement @xmath32 is a curve @xmath33 with two irreducible components , one of which @xmath34 has a cusp singularity ; the lagrangian torus @xmath5 lies in a neighbourhood of the cusp . rather than working with a single lagrangian torus",
    ", we consider a family @xmath35 which as @xmath36 collapses into the cusp point on @xmath34 .",
    "intuitively , the limit of a family of holomorphic discs @xmath37}$ ] as @xmath36 is either a holomorphic sphere in @xmath38 disjoint from @xmath39 , or is the constant map to the cusp point . the first case is excluded since @xmath39 is ample ; the second is impossible for topological reasons concerning the fundamental group @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a small neighbourhood of the cusp .",
    "the upshot is that no such families of discs can exist , enabling us to appeal to chekanov s work .    for technical reasons , we in fact work with a blown - up compactification @xmath42 of @xmath0",
    "in which the complement @xmath43 is a divisor with normal crossings .",
    "the tori @xmath44 now appear as so - called linking tori for a normal crossing point @xmath45 of @xmath46 . to construct them as manifestly lagrangian tori , and to make the abovementioned limiting argument for holomorphic discs rigorous , we use a simple algebro - geometric trick . take @xmath47 and blow up the point @xmath48 , obtaining a threefold @xmath49 with a projection @xmath50 .",
    "the singular fibre @xmath51 has an irreducible component which is a @xmath52 .",
    "we take a clifford torus @xmath53 in that component , and move it by parallel transport to obtain family of lagrangian tori @xmath54 , @xmath55 $ ] , in the nearby fibres @xmath56 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "these fibres are naturally identified with @xmath30 , and we define @xmath44 to be the image of @xmath54 under this identification , for @xmath58 $ ] . since the total",
    "submanifold @xmath59}k_t \\subset y$ ] is lagrangian , gromov compactness can be applied directly to families of discs with boundary in @xmath60 .",
    "the drawback of this argument is that the @xmath61 carry varying khler forms . to take account of this",
    ", we give a careful discussion of stein deformations in section  [ sec : def ] , and introduce in section  [ sec : essential ] the technical notion of a `` stein - essential '' lagrangian submanifold .",
    "the idea is that for any given @xmath62 , we can deform our stein structure and our lagrangian submanifold , in such a way that at the endpoint of the deformation , there are no pseudo - holomorphic discs of area less than @xmath63 .",
    "section  [ sec : linking ] introduces lagrangian linking tori , and describes the implications of a linking torus being stein - essential . only in section  [ sec : conclusion ] are these ingredients assembled to derive theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "there are at least two possible alternative ways of analyzing the symplectic nature of @xmath2 .",
    "one could try to use floer homology or symplectic homology as introduced by viterbo @xcite and cieliebak - floer - hofer @xcite .",
    "in fact , as we intend to discuss elsewhere , existence of a stein - essential lagrangian submanifold already implies that @xmath64 . to compute @xmath65",
    "precisely would presumably require an analysis of the reeb flow at infinity , though since floer homology behaves well under products @xcite it would be enough to do the computation for @xmath0 itself .",
    "floer homology may also distinguish between different exotic symplectic structures on @xmath3 , which falls outside the scope of the arguments used here .",
    "the other possible approach would be via a symplectic field theory decomposition argument .",
    "the aim would be to prove that if @xmath2 is subcritical , there has to be a non - constant algebraic map @xmath66 , contradicting a property of contractible surfaces of log general type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.7.1 ) .",
    "eliashberg has announced a theorem which says that if a smooth projective variety contains a smooth ample divisor with subcritical complement , then the variety has many rational curves . in examples",
    ", it appears that these rational curves are closures of maps of @xmath67 to the complement , but this is not well - understood in general .",
