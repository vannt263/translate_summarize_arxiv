    "gravitational lensing by foreground large - scale structures of the universe distorts many varieties of background sources . among these , detection of weak lensing - induced signatures in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "will provide a sensitive probe of matter distribution on large - scales and at high redshifts up to @xmath4 ( e.g. zaldarriaga & seljak 1999 ) . on the other hand , the cmb photons",
    "can also be distorted by non - gravitational effect along the path from the last scattering surface to us .",
    "the most significant pattern is the excess of the cmb power spectrum relative to primordial cmb anisotropy at @xmath5 ( dawson et al .",
    "2001 ; bond et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is produced by the inverse compton scattering of the cbm photons by intervening energetic electrons confined within massive clusters , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "studies of both the sz - selected clusters and the sz power spectrum yield important information about the distribution and evolution of hot intracluster medium in the universe .    at scales below 10 arcminutes characterized by @xmath6@xmath7 ,",
    "the cmb power spectrum is dominated by the thermal sz effect of clusters distributed at intermediate / high redshifts up to @xmath8 ( cooray 2000 ; cooray & hu 2000 ) .",
    "an interesting question thus arises : can the sz sky be further distorted by the weak gravitational lensing effect of foreground matter inhomogeneities ?",
    "namely , we would like to address the question of to what extent the sz power spectrum at small angular scales should be corrected for because of weak lensing by large - scale structures .",
    "it has been noted that the deep gravitational potentials of clusters can lead to both steplike wiggles on the cmb sky ( seljak & zaldarriaga 2000 ) and a systematic magnification bias of unresolved background radios behind clusters ( loeb & refregier 1997 ) . the latter may contaminate the measurement of the thermal sz effect if the removal of background radio sources is made without inclusion of the inevitable lensing magnification bias .",
    "furthermore , the sz sky is also correlated with the weak lensing map because the two effects are generated by common massive dark halos ( goldberg & spergel 1999 ; cooray & hu 2000 ) .",
    "the problem we explore in this paper is more straightforward , in the sense that the background source is now the sz map which is associated with each cluster , while the foreground lenses are large - scale structures along the line of sight .",
    "technically , we can use the formalism similar to the calculation of weak lensing of the cmb power spectrum , which has been well developed in the literature ( seljak 1996 ; bernardeau 1997 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1999 ; hu 2000 ; zaldarriaga 2000 ) , except that the distribution function of background sources ( clusters ) should now be taken into account for our case . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmological model ( @xmath9cdm ) with the parameters determined recently by _ wmap _ : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "following the treatment of weak lensing of the cmb under the flat - sky approximation ( e.g. bernardeau 1997 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1999 ; hu 2000 ; zaldarriaga 2000 ) , we calculate the lensed sz temperature fluctuation @xmath16 in the direction @xmath17 by @xmath18^i              t^s(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\theta$}),\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the unlensed sz temperature pattern in direction @xmath17 produced by clusters at redshift @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes the lensing deflection angle by foreground large - scale structures along the line of sight , and the projected potential @xmath22 is related to the three - dimensional potential @xmath23 of density perturbation @xmath24 at @xmath25 through @xmath26 in which @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the angular diameter distances from the matter inhomogeneities at @xmath25 and the observer at @xmath29 to the sources at @xmath20 , respectively , @xmath30 is the comoving distance and @xmath31 .",
    "the power spectrum of the lensed sz temperature map up to the fourth order in deflection angle in terms of equation ( 1 ) is thus ( e.g. cooray 2003 ) @xmath32 ^ 2 }                     { |{\\bf l}^{\\prime}|^4 }   \\nonumber",

    "nevertheless , inclusion of the low - mass halos may significantly alter the distribution function @xmath39 .",

    "is strongly affected by non - linear structures .",
    "following seljak ( 2000 ) and cooray , hu & miralda - escud ( 2000 ) we use a halo approach to calculate the non - linear dark matter power spectrum @xmath38 , which consists of a single halo term @xmath71 and a clustering term @xmath72 : @xmath73 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the fourier transform of dark matter density profile @xmath75 of a halo @xmath54 at @xmath25 , and @xmath76 is the mean mass density of the background universe at @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt the functional form suggested by numerical simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; nfw ) for @xmath75 and fix the concentration parameter in terms of the empirical fitting formula of bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    finally , we need to specify the gas distribution of dark halos in order to evaluate the compton @xmath53-parameter .",
    "since the weak lensing effect of the sz map may occur at very small angular scales , we should employ a more realistic model for the gas distribution in the central regions of clusters instead of the commonly adopted self - similar model in literature .",
    "recall that the sz power spectra predicted by the self - similar model and other physically - motivated models such as preheating and radiative cooling become indistinguishable roughly at @xmath77 . for simplicity",
    ", here we work with an analytic preheating model , in which the gas distribution in massive halos can be obtained by combining the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium with a modified entropy profile @xmath78 .",
    "namely , a constant entropy floor of @xmath79 kev @xmath80 is now added to the entropy profile @xmath81 predicted by the self - similar model which again takes the universal density profile ( nfw ) .",
    "this model allows us to essentially reproduce the observed x - ray surface brightness distribution ( i.e. @xmath82 model ) and statistical properties of groups and clusters ( e.g. the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation and entropy distribution ) ( babul et al .",
    "2002 ; xue & wu 2003 ) .",
    "we first demonstrate in figure 1 the lensing power spectrum @xmath34 for the sz sky . for comparison",
    ", we have also shown the result for the cmb calculated by setting @xmath83 in eqn.(5 ) and running the publicly available code cmbfast . at small scales , the lensing power spectra for the sz and cmb maps appear to be similar in shape , but the lensing amplitude for the sz sources is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that for the cmb .",
    "this is simply because there are much more intervening matter inhomogeneities acting as lenses for the cmb photons than those for the sz signals generated by clusters located mostly at @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 peaks at lower @xmath3 for the sz map than for the cmb , consistent with the fact that the large - scale structures responsible for weak lensing of the sz sky are at low redshifts and therefore , subtend relatively large angles .",
    "recall that gravitational lensing conserves the surface brightness of background source .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 acts as a narrow window function on the background power spectrum @xmath33 via eqn.(4 ) , which alters the intrinsic patterns of @xmath33 .",
    "our intuition in terms of this simple argument is that the weak lensing effect on the sz power spectrum is probably much smaller than the lensing signature on the cmb , if the lensing induced correction is simply proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the lensing power spectra at small scales are dominated by non - linear structures , and linear approximation of matter power spectrum @xmath85 may gives rise to an underestimate of the lensing effect .",
    "nevertheless , the extent to which background sources are affected by weak lensing of foreground large - scale structures also depends critically on the shape of the source power spectrum .",
    "we begin by recalling how the cmb can effectively be lensed by large - scale structures ( see hu 2000 ) : at large scales @xmath86 , the cmb power spectrum can be considered to be a slowing varying function of @xmath3 ( see figure.2 ) , and we can approximately take @xmath33 out of the second integral in eqn(4 ) .",
    "the lensing induced two terms to the first order approximation in deflection angle cancel if @xmath87 is further replaced by @xmath88 .",
    "this yields @xmath89 . at small scales ,",
    "existence of the strong silk damping of intrinsic cmb power spectrum at @xmath90 makes the contribution of the first correction term in eqn.(4 ) considerably small , and the second term dominates the lensing correction . as a result , weak lensing always leads to an increase of the cmb power at small angular scales , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "now we turn to the sz power spectrum : unlike the intrinsic cmb , there is no significant damping effect on the thermal sz power spectrum over all angular scales .",
    "rather , the sz power spectrum has a long , slowly decreasing tail at high @xmath3 . in other word , the first negative term in eqn.(4 )",
    "can no longer be ignored . applying the approximation that @xmath33 is slowly varying and @xmath91 to eqn.(4 ) , we have @xmath89 to the first order in deflection angle .",
    "our numerical calculation reaches essentially the same conclusion . in table 1",
    "we have listed the relative corrections @xmath92 for a set of multipoles from @xmath93 to @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the lensing induced corrections are well below @xmath1 even up to @xmath94 .",
    "meanwhile , we have given in table 1 the power spectrum ratios of the fourth order correction [ the last three terms of eqn.(4 ) ] to the second order approximation in @xmath34 [ the second and third terms of eqn.(4 ) ] . while the contribution of higher order corrections to the power spectrum @xmath95 becomes increasingly important with the decrease of angular scale ,",
    "the effect of higher order terms on the evaluation of @xmath95 is still negligibly small on scales up to @xmath2 as compared with the contribution from the first order approximation in deflection angle .    0.2truein    0.2truein    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it has been shown that the angular power spectrum of the thermal sz sky is almost unaffected by the weak lensing of foreground large - scale structures .",
    "this is primarily due to both the relatively weaker gravitational potentials of low - redshift matter inhomogeneities that can act as lenses for sz sources and the shallower shape of sz power spectrum at smaller angular scales . note that we have adopted the gas density profile predicted by the so - called preheating model , which results in a more rapid decline of the sz power spectrum at large @xmath3 than the one predicted by the self - similar model or cooling model ( wu & xue 2003 ) .",
    "in other word , we have already provided an optimistic estimate of the weak lensing effect on the sz power spectrum since significant fluctuations intrinsic to background sources are more easily be distorted by lensing .",
    "this explains why weak lensing of large - scale structures of the universe can effectively alter the cmb sky at @xmath96 as the cmb power spectrum exhibits the sharp damping signatures at high @xmath3 ( hu 2000 ) .",
    "the angular power spectrum of 21 cm map of the reionization at @xmath97 also demonstrates a significant decline feature at @xmath98 ( e.g. zaldarriaga , furlanetto & hernquist 2003 ) , and it is thus expected that the 21 cm fluctuation of the reionization should be affected by weak lensing ( pen 2003 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the present study has eliminated the concern that the sz sky may be further contaminated by weak lensing of foreground large - scale structures of the universe .",
