    "the linear superposition principle is at the heart of quantum mechanics since , using it , one can control the properties of the single states making them more or less pronounced .",
    "the most significant example reflecting the power of such a principle are the schrdinger - cat states @xcite , which exhibit various nonclassical effects such as squeezing , sub - poissonian statistics and oscillations in photon - number distribution , even if the original states are close to the classical ones @xcite . such type of states ( of a @xmath0th mode for convenience ) can be represented as    @xmath1 is a coherent state of the @xmath0th mode with complex amplitudes @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a relative phase and @xmath4 is the normalization constant having the form    @xmath5}.\\label{2}\\ ] ]    specifically there are three values of @xmath3 , namely , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for which ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to even coherent ( ecs ) , odd coherent ( ocs ) and yurke - stoler ( yss ) states , respectively .",
    "these three states will be frequently used in this paper .",
    "there are several proposals for generating states ( [ 1 ] ) in various nonlinear processes , e.g. see .",
    "further , the evolution of cat states in several quantum systems has been intensively studied @xcite@xcite . for convenience of the present work we refer to the interaction of these states with environment , where the common goal of such studies is the comprehension and description of the decoherence processes ( decoherence is the rapid transformation of a pure linear superposition state into the corresponding statistical mixture state ) in the system under observation , and the energy loss due to the interaction with the reservoir .",
    "most of these papers adopt the heisenberg ",
    "langevin approach or the markov master equation approach .",
    "although the non - markovian dynamics is important in quantum physics ( theory ) , a unified and compact treatment of the non - markovian reservoirs dates as late from @xcite , where also the decay and revival of the schrdinger - cat states are characterized .    on the other hand , parametric amplifier ( nondegenerate ) takes a considerable interest in quantum optics since it can perfectly generate two - mode squeezing .",
    "recently , this device has been supported with the fast progress of new nonlinear crystals and improved laser sources , especially femtosecond lasers @xcite and it has been employed in experiments , e.g. in the interference experiments .",
    "an investigation of the statistical properties of the parametric amplifier with losses @xcite and without losses for compound - mode case have been performed using different techniques when the modes are initially prepared in the coherent states .",
    "the anticorrelation in this model is an interesting effect @xcite , where also under certain conditions the variance of the photon number is less than the average photon number and the photocounting distribution becomes narrower than the corresponding poisson distribution for a coherent state with the same mean photon number .",
    "moreover , the sum photon - number distribution can exhibit collapses and revivals @xcite ( and references therein ) similar to those typical in the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite ; the former is in the photon number domain rather than the time domain .",
    "so the question we would like to address in this paper is the following : what would be the influence of the interference in phase space on these phenomena ?",
    "in other words , we study the evolution of the cat states ( [ 1 ] ) through the parametric amplifier and take into account the interaction with environment . the system alone may be described by tracing a more complete description over the environment . actually , the interaction considered here is quite different from that considered in @xcite@xcite because there are two operations controlling its behaviour , which are the interference in phase space and the entanglement ( correlation ) between the signal and idler modes as well as between the signal - idler system and the environmental oscillators ( reservoirs ) to which the system may be connected .",
    "such entanglements lead to the increase of the marginal entropies of the subsystems ( as is known , if the density operator describes pure states , then the entropy ( @xmath8 ) is zero , otherwise @xmath9 ) @xcite ) . for the present system we treat the single- and compound - mode cases .",

    "furthermore , this function can be obtained experimentally using the optical homodyne tomography @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the @xmath89 functions of ecs , ocs and yss ( at @xmath33 ) are consisting of two gaussian bells , resulting from statistical mixture of individual composite states and interference fringes in between ( signature of the nonclassical effects ) originating from the superposition between different components of the states .",
    "nevertheless , the locations of the extreme values of the interference fringes of ecs , ocs and ycs are quite different .",
    "there are several papers , e.g. , that have been devoted to these fringes making them less or more pronounced by allowing the cat states to evolve in different quantum optical systems .",
    "for example , the decay rate of the interference fringes of the @xmath89 function of cat states of a mode which is coupled to a phase - sensitive reservoir ( squeezed reservoirs ) @xcite , @xcite p. 114 , can be smaller or larger than that for ordinary thermal heat bath reservoir @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in these systems the fringes can be washed out completely for a specific choice of the interaction parameters . in the language of the density matrix",
    "this means that the contribution of the off - diagonal elements is small compared with the contribution of the diagonal elements but it is not necessarily zero .",
    "of course , such diagonalization produces a statistical mixture of coherent states , which are close to classical wavepackets .",
    "now if we consider the @xmath89 function of the signal mode for the system under discussion , the situation becomes more complicated than before owing to the entanglement between the signal and idler modes .",
    "the structure of the density matrix ( [ 8 ] ) carries more information , e.g. , when the signal and idler modes are initially prepared in a distinguishable macroscopic cat state and after switching on the interaction , the initial two gaussian bells of the @xmath89 function of the signal mode can be transformed , in principle , into four - fold form as indicated in ( [ 9 ] ) , and the initial interference fringes of the cat will be dramatically changed during the interaction as a result of the competition between the different components of @xmath53 and @xmath51 . moreover , during evolution , the rate of movement of the centres of peaks of the @xmath89 function is rather different and this leads to irregularity in its behaviour . so that the evolution of the cat states in the present interaction yields different types of multicomponent cat states @xcite .",
    "all these facts can be seen in figs .",
    "c , where we have displayed the @xmath89 function for the signal mode ( excluding losses ) for the given values of the parameters . in these figures ( and throughout this paper ) we have taken @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the phase of the initial amplitude of the @xmath0th mode and also we have defined @xmath101 in ( [ 21 ] ) as @xmath102 where the quadrature variances @xmath103 and @xmath104 of the signal mode are associated with the real part @xmath105 and imaginary part @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the @xmath89 function curves contain most of their information within one plane , in particular , for constant values of @xmath106 .",
    "for this reason and for simplicity we have plotted a @xmath89 function in one plane considering @xmath107 , where the @xmath89 function illustrates more pronounced nonclassical effects ( e.g. , by means of negative values ) for the case @xmath108 and also it includes a representative information for the other cases .",
    "1a shows that the initial nonclassical negative values of the @xmath89 function have been smeared out and the system collapses to four - component statistical mixture state .",
    "further , such behaviour reveals that decoherence can be established via the entanglement between different modes in the parametric processes . in these cases the single - mode behaviour undergoes amplification resulting from the spontaneous pump photon decay @xcite .",
    "it should be borne in mind that in the present case the system is completely isolated and then such type of decoherence can be called nondissipative decoherence @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nonclassical negative values can be recovered by controlling the  distance \" between the initial cat states of the signal and idler modes . to be more specific , when @xmath108 these negative values",
    "can be realized , however , when @xmath109 they will disappear as indicated in figs .",
    "1b and c , respectively . in fig .",
    "1c a three - peak structure is dominant .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "1a , b and c is instructive .",
    "so , excluding the influence of the environment the system can decohere and recohere by adjusting the initial distance between the components of the cat of the input modes .",
    "however , for the dissipative case the decoherence process is related not only to the amplification of the pumping field but also to damping of radiation caused by the flux of coherent energy from radiation to the reservoirs and noise from reservoirs to the radiation . under these circumstances",
    "the decoherence can be achieved in a time shorter than that for the undamped case .",
    "we displayed the @xmath89 function for the overdamped and underdamped cases in figs .",
    "2a and b , respectively , for the same situation as in fig .",
    "these figures show overall distortion due to the dissipative nature of dynamics .",
    "it is clear that the origin of the main contribution is in the diagonal elements of the density matrix and then the negative values of the @xmath89 function of the undamped case ( fig .",
    "1b ) are washed out . from fig .",
    "2a one can observe that the @xmath89 function exhibits the well - known shape for the thermal light , i.e. the system exhibits bose - einstein statistics ( super - classical light ) .",
    "however , from fig . 2b ( underdamped case ) we can observe that the two - peak structure is dominant .",
    "this situation is similar to that of the single harmonic oscillator interacting with the thermal bath in which a double gaussian structure with missing oscillatory behaviour occurs .",
    "the explanation of the behaviour of @xmath89 function in fig .",
    "2 can be understood by analyzing the behaviour of the @xmath89 function for the single - mode general term ( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the overdamped case for which the values of the parameters @xmath110 are exponentially decaying ( this can be easily checked ) when the interaction is going on and accordingly the centres of the peaks move toward the origin and eventually the peaks merge with each other .",
    "the opposite situation occurs for the underdamped case .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in these cases ( overdamped and underdamped cases ) the contribution of the off - diagonal elements corresponding to @xmath53 is suppressed faster than that of @xmath51 .",
    "this point will be discussed in the sum photon - number distribution in the following section .    in general , if the interaction between different components in the system occurs ( regardless whether the interaction with environment is considered or not ) , the decoherence gradually increases and thus the system evolves into a mixture ( @xmath111 is the reduced density matrix of the signal mode ) , i.e. there occurs a destruction of the inherent nonclassical effects .",
    "the rate of destruction is sensitive to the nature of both the reservoir and parametric processes .",
    "furthermore , we should mention that the @xmath112 function possesses somewhat similar behaviour as the @xmath89 function in such a case , i.e. it can take on negative values in certain regions for certain values of the parameters and therefore it can not behave like a classical probability distribution function .",
    "such an effect is independent of the type of cat states , which are initially used in the interaction .",
    "finally , we should stress that it is difficult to analyze the behaviour of the off - diagonal elements to obtain concrete information , so we have basically concentrated on the computer simulation .",
    "the concept of photon is an integral part of the modern description of light and the discrete nature of light can be demonstrated by a photon detector based on the photoelectric effect .    on the other hand , one of most interesting nonclassical effects emerging from the superposition principle is the oscillatory behaviour of the photon - number distribution .",
    "in general , such behaviour is closely related to the behaviour of the @xmath89 function , however , this is necessary but not sufficient condition .",
    "( solid curve ) , @xmath113 ( dashed curve ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    for example , the photon - number distributions of ecs , ocs and yss are completely different ; whereas those of ecs and ocs exhibit pairwise oscillations in phase space ( even number of photons can be observed for ecs and odd numbers for ocs ) , the distribution of yss is a poissonian even though the behaviour of the @xmath89 function for these states is qualitatively similar . in the interaction under discussion for",
    "undamped case the oscillatory behaviour in the photon - number distribution can be established even if the initial cat states exhibit poissonian statistics .",
    "this is of course based on the values of the interaction parameters .",
    "the origin of such behaviour is in the interference in phase space where the photon - number distribution of input coherent light is always displaying a single - peak structure , which is broader than the corresponding poisson distribution with the same mean photon number .",
    "we start our discussion by investigating the behaviour of the undamped case .",
    "we consider here the photon - number distribution @xmath114 of the signal mode when the signal and idler modes are initially prepared in the yss .",
    "we have seen that this quantity can exhibit oscillatory behaviour after switching on of the interaction by a suitable time provided that @xmath115 , as indicated in fig .",
    "3 for shown values of the parameters . in this figure @xmath116 , where @xmath100 is the phase of the initial @xmath0th mode ( signal or idler ) and @xmath14 is the phase of the pump as before . in this case",
    "@xmath117 represents the phase mismatch .",
    "furthermore , one can see that when @xmath117 changes from @xmath7 to @xmath118 the parity of oscillations changes ( compare dashed and solid curves ) .",
    "the reason for taking @xmath119 can be found in @xcite .",

    "finally , it has been verified that the behaviour of @xmath114 for the damped case when @xmath108 and @xmath123 is quite similar .",

    "squeezing is one of the most important phenomena in quantum optics because of its applications in various areas , e.g. in optics communication , quantum information theory , etc .",
    "squeezed light can be measured by a homodyne detection in which the signal is superimposed on a strong coherent beam of the local oscillator .",
    "furthermore , quite recently it has been shown experimentally that there is an evidence of squeezed light in the biological systems @xcite .",

    "here we analyze the influence of different types of cat states on the behaviour of quadrature squeezing .",
    "to do so , considering @xmath2 to be real , we write down the quadrature variance of the @xmath124-component of(which is expected to yield squeezing ) for the signal mode and various initial input cat states as follows : @xmath125 \\right\\},\\;\\ ; \\label{24}\\ ] ] @xmath126 \\right\\ } , \\;\\ ; \\label{25}\\ ] ] @xmath127 \\right\\ } .\\label{26 } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these expressions the subscripts ee , oe and ey stand for the initial ( signal , idler ) modes which are in ( ecs , ecs ) , ( ocs , ecs ) and ( ecs , yss ) , respectively .",

    "also it can be mentioned that the correlation between signal and idler modes does not occur since cross terms such as @xmath129 are absent .",
    "actually , this is connected with the two - photon nature of ecs and ocs where @xmath130 , when @xmath131 is an odd integer .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the origin of losses caused by reservoirs in expressions ( [ 24])([26 ] ) is the mean photon number .",
    "further , it should be reminded that ecs and ycs can exhibit normal squeezing , which is more pronounced for ecs , however , ocs are unsqueezed states @xcite .",
    "further , for the undamped case with @xmath132 , expression ( [ 25 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath133 + \\alpha_{1}^{2}\\cosh^{2}(gt)(\\coth\\alpha_{1}^{2 } -1 ) \\right\\}.\\label{27}\\ ] ] the last term in this expression is non - negative and can become zero by appropriately choosing the value of @xmath134 . in order to get squeezing in the signal mode , expression ( [ 27 ] ) must be negative and this depends on the behaviour of the function @xmath135 .",
    "in other words , squeezing can be established if @xmath136 , however , @xmath137 , and consequently squeezing can not be obtained .",
    "more specifically , to obtain single - mode squeezing from this device , the mode under consideration should be prepared initially in a squeezed - cat state regardless of the type of the cat state in the free port ( if it is squeezed or not ) .",
    "furthermore , one can easily estimate how long the single - mode squeezing of the initial light can survive if this light is imposed at the input of the parametric amplifier . restricting ourselves to the input ecs and using the fact that squeezing is surviving",
    "if @xmath138 , the time range over which such a situation occurs is @xmath139 where @xmath140 has the same expression as before . for @xmath141",
    "( i.e. ( [ 25 ] ) ) the procedure shows that the required time is a complex number and this agrees with the previous remark .    from ( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) one can easily verify that the amount of squeezing available in @xmath142 is much larger than that in @xmath143 provided that @xmath144 is finite ; nevertheless , when the value of @xmath144 is zero or large enough , both quantities are typical .",
    "this implies that the larger the degree of squeezing in the free port is , the more squeezing will be available in the mode under consideration .     for the signal mode being initially in ecs and the idler mode being in ecs ( solid curve ) , yss ( short - dashed curve ) and in ocs ( long - dashed curve ) for @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "triangle- and star - centred curves are given for the squeezing factors of a zero - temperature heat bath ( @xmath147 ) and a nonzero - temperature heat bath ( @xmath148 ) , respectively , for the underdamped case with @xmath149 and for the same situation as represented by the solid curve .",

    ". 5 has been displayed to illustrate the behaviour of the @xmath150-squeezing factor for the undamped case when the signal mode is prepared initially in ecs and the idler mode in ecs ( solid curve ) , yss ( short - dashed curve ) and ocs ( long - dashed curve ) in dependence on @xmath151 for the given values of the parameters .",
    "furthermore , the triangle- and star - centred curves represent the underdamped case with a zero - temperature ( @xmath152 ) and a nonzero - temperature heat baths ( @xmath153 ) , respectively , when the two modes are in ecs .",
    "the choice of @xmath154 is related to the fact that the initial ecs gives maximum squeezing at this value .",
    "now the analytical facts discussed above are remarkable in fig .",
    "5 . further , from this figure we can also see that for the ocs - idler - mode squeezing is minimum when @xmath155 is close to zero ( indeed there is a singularity at @xmath156 related to the nature of the ocs ) , increasing monotonically as @xmath144 increases , then it stagnates at large values of @xmath144 yielding its maximum value . actually , the behaviour of this case is quite different from the behaviour of the ecs - idler- and yss - idler - mode cases ( compare long - dashed curve with solid and short - dashed curves in fig .",
    "5 ) , where the maximum value of the former is the minimum value for the latter .",
    "this means that for large values of @xmath155 the signal mode can produce the same value of squeezing regardless of the type of the input cat states in the free port .",
    "also this figure shows how one can control the single - mode squeezing relying on the type of initial cat states in the free port .",
    "we now turn our attention to the damped case . as we mentioned earlier @xmath93 in expressions ( [ 24])([26 ] )",

    "we have given two examples in fig .",
    "5 for the underdamped case ( triangle- and star - centred curves ) . comparing these curves with the solid one in the same figure ,",
    "the conclusion becomes clear .",
    "moreover , from the comparison between triangle - centred curve and star - centred curve we can conclude that in nonzero - temperature heat bath case the quantum coherence ( i.e. nonclassical effects ) is lost much faster than in zero - temperature heat bath case @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the occurrence of squeezing in the damped case has been verified also in the behaviour of the @xmath89 function where for the same values of the parameters we obtained that it always exhibits noise - ellipse forms of cuts together with single - peak or two - peak structure according to @xmath144 is small or large , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for the cat states interacting with heat bath the authors of @xcite claimed that squeezing is much more robust with respect to damping than the oscillations in the photon - number distribution or the interference in phase space described by @xmath89 function .",
    "they obtained this conclusion by analyzing these quantities graphically .",
    "nevertheless , in their analysis , squeezing has been obtained for a specific region of @xmath157 ( in particular when @xmath157 is small ) whereas the behaviour of the photon - number distribution and the @xmath89 function has been analyzed in a different region ( when @xmath158 , where squeezing does not occur , see fig .",
    "8a in @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the incorrect conclusion .",
    "we have examined the behaviour of both the photon - number distribution and the @xmath89 function for these cases using the same values of the parameters as in @xcite , however , we have taken @xmath159 ( where squeezing is noticeable ) and found that the behaviour of these quantities reflects equally the properties of squeezed light . for more details reader can consult @xcite .    finally ,",
    "for the single - mode reduced factorial moments , which can be measured by a set of photodetectors , we have found that the behaviour of these quantities is in a good agreement with the behaviour of the single - mode squeezing .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the two - mode properties for the system under discussion by determining the sum photon - number distribution , two - mode squeezing and reduced factorial moments .      the oscillations in the joint photon - number distribution might be observed in experiments that generate two - mode squeezed light in which the two modes may be distinguished by frequency or by propagation direction .",
    "having separated the two modes , as was done by using a polarizing beamsplitter @xcite , one can send them directly onto separate photocounters and then build up the joint photon - number distribution from the photocount statistics of a sequence of pulses @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the sum photon - number distribution @xmath160 of the nondegenerate parametric amplifier , when the modes are initially prepared in coherent state and under certain conditions , displays two regimes , which exhibit either single - peak structure or oscillatory behaviour .",
    "the single - peak structure can be narrower ( or broader ) than that of the corresponding poissonian distribution showing nonclassical ( or classical ) effects .",
    "the striking feature is that the @xmath160 can exhibit , for certain choice of the interaction parameters , collapses and revivals in the photon - number domain somewhat similar to those known in the jcm . for the present system",
    "the situation is rather complicated regarding to the evolution of the density matrix ( [ 8 ] ) where the interference in phase space is established . excluding dissipation and using @xmath119 as in @xcite , we have seen generally that @xmath160 exhibits always oscillatory behaviour irrespective of which type of cat states has been considered initially .",
    "moreover , @xmath160 can yield pairwise oscillations identifying that even or odd photons are being observed",
    ". figs . 6 and 7 have been plotted to show such a phenomenon for given values of the parameters . from fig .",
    "6 we observe that the long scale oscillations in the behaviour of @xmath160 with @xmath161 are somewhat similar to those of squeezed states @xcite . actually for squeezed states the pairwise oscillations are explained as a direct consequence of the quadratic , or two - photon nature of the squeeze operator @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath163 $ ] @xcite .",
    "however , here the origin of the pairwise oscillations in @xmath160 is in the competition between the processes described by three parts of the density matrix of the field .",
    "figures 7a  c give insight into this point , i.e. they show the manner in which the photon - number distributions of the three parts of the density matrix ( [ 8 ] ) compete .",
    "more precisely , figs .",
    "7a , b and c represent the sum photon - number distributions @xmath164 and @xmath165 associated with @xmath166 and @xmath53 , correspondingly .",
    "7a shows revival - collapse pattern , which is resulting from the statistical mixture part ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from this figure one can observe that when the number of photons increases , the amplitude of the revivals diminishes , but the revival periods extend .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such a quantum collapse - revival phenomenon has been seen for the photon - number distribution of single - mode @xcite and two - mode @xcite squeezed coherent states with complex squeeze and displacement parameters .",
    "associations with the quantum phases of the modes may be considered @xcite , @xcite p. 281 . from fig .",
    "7b it is clear that @xmath167 oscillates between negative and positive values .",

    "7a , fig . 7b and fig .",
    "7c shows that the values of @xmath165 are approximately negligible compared with those of @xmath168 and @xmath167 .",
    "now if we turn our attention back to fig .",
    "6 we can recognize that the competition between @xmath168 and @xmath167 leads to the destruction of collapse - revival phenomenon ( which appeared in fig .",
    "7a ) , however , the distribution  evolves \" in an interesting manner similarly as that for squeezed states .",
    "in fact , the situation here is in contrast with that of the evolution of cat states in the jcm where the interference in phase space makes the revival - collapse phenomenon in the atomic inversion more pronounced when the revival time equals the half of that for the standard jcm with initial coherent light @xcite .",
    "the reason is that for the latter case the distribution of the spectral components of the atomic inversion is one dimensional distribution since only one mode is involved , whereas here we have two - dimensional superimposed distributions .",
    "further , we have obtained that the oscillations in @xmath160 increase if either @xmath15 or @xmath169 or both are increased .",
    "this fact is clear if we look at the problem as evolution of cat states under the action of two - mode squeeze operator , where the squeezing parameter in this case is @xmath170 and the oscillations become more pronounced for the large values of @xmath171 . in conclusion , for the system under consideration",
    "the origin of the oscillations in the sum photon - number distribution is two - fold : ( i ) the interference in phase space .",
    "( ii ) the strong coupling between the signal and idler modes of the system in the course of the interaction time .",
    "on the other hand , we have found by an explicit algebraic calculation for all quantities studied in this paper excepting quadrature squeezing that the contributions associated with elements of @xmath51 and @xmath53 involve @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "this fact together with the information included in figs .",
    "7 show that @xmath160 can collapse and yield decoherence in relation to distribution for statistical mixture part using specific types of cat states initially .",
    "more illustratively , preparing one of the modes initially in ecs ( or ocs ) and the other in yss or vice versa , the @xmath160 evolves as described by fig .",
    "7a ( for the same values of the parameters ) .",
    "this shows how one can decohere the system apart from the amplification nature of the system and without coupling it to the environment .",
    "we call such a type of decoherence a phase decoherence .",
    "actually , for some quantities the contribution of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix is responsible for the nonclassical effects , e.g. as we will see below in the compound - mode reduced factorial moments .",
    "then we can make a good estimation of these phenomena using such a property .",
    "the final remark is that the nonclassical effects for the compound - mode case are much richer than those for the single - mode case .",
    "this results from the strong quantum correlation between the signal and idler modes , which manifests itself as the summation in expressions ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) . to make this point clear",
    ", we give fig .",
    "8a for the @xmath160 and for the same situation as that of the solid curve in fig .",
    "the comparison between these two figures is instructive .",
    "further , fig .",
    "8b includes information on the damped case where one can observe smooth oscillations for the underdamped case ( solid curve ) and two - peak structure for the overdamped case ( dashed curve ) .",
    "specifically , for the overdamped case the off - diagonal elements are completely suppressed .",
    "firstly , we will discuss two - mode squeezing , which can be measured by heterodyne detection where squeezing is carried jointly by two modes of different frequencies and the local oscillator has a frequency midway in between @xcite .",
    "we proceed taking into account that the nondegenerate parametric amplifier is well described by the two - mode squeeze operator .",
    "actually , two - mode squeezing phenomenon is essentially connected with the states upon which such operator acts . in other words , squeezing may not exist for some specific states even if they include two - mode squeeze operator in their structures . to show this we give the form of the two - mode squeezing factor @xmath150 when the signal and idler modes are initially prepared in cat states , excluding losses , considering @xmath174 , are real and @xmath175 . in this case",
    "the squeezing factor @xmath150 takes the form @xmath176 , \\label{29}\\ ] ] where @xmath177 , represent the corresponding single - mode squeezing factors of the signal and idler modes , respectively . from expression (",
    "[ 29 ] ) it is clear that the correlation between the signal and idler modes does not exist since @xmath178 , where @xmath179 , are the expectation values of the @xmath124-quadrature of the signal and idler modes .",
    "the existence of correlation between these two modes is important to obtain squeezing in the compound modes even if the individual modes are not themselves squeezed @xcite .",
    "expression ( [ 29 ] ) shows that interference in phase space can destroy squeezing and also that the rates of degradation of the two - mode and single - mode squeezing are on the same level for symmetrical losses .",
    "also it is obvious that the two - mode squeezing can be realized if at least one of the two modes ( signal or idler ) can exhibit single - mode squeezing .",
    "this is necessary but not sufficient condition .",
    "further , the maximum squeezing may be produced when both the signal and idler modes exhibit maximum single - mode squeezing .",
    "this reflects the importance of the choice of the type of the initial cat states . from the discussion in section 3 it is obvious",
    "that when the two modes are initially in ocs , the interaction can not generate two - mode squeezing .",
    "we now discuss the case that one of the modes is initially squeezed ( ecs ) and the other is unsqueezed ( ocs ) for the same situation as that in ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "the required time to obtain squeezing in the compound - mode case ( @xmath180 ) is    @xmath181    this inequality gives relation between the squeeze time and the  distances \" between the states , which are forming the cats .",
    "so that the length of the device can be adjusted to obtain squeezed light .",
    "an analysis to the right - hand side of ( [ 29a ] ) gives that the maximum scaled time ( effective time ) for squeezing is @xmath182 at @xmath183 .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that the @xmath124-component quadrature squeezing of ecs takes on its maximum , whereas that of ocs vanishes .     against @xmath184 for @xmath185 , and for the undamped case",
    "when the signal and idler modes are prepared initially in ( ocs , ocs ) ( solid curve ) and ( ocs , ecs ) ( long - dashed curve ) . the damped case is considered for the same situation as the solid curve , but for the underdamped case ( short - dashed curve ) @xmath186 for the overdamped case ( star - centred curve ) @xmath187 .",
    "the straightline shows the antibunching bound .",
    ", width=377 ]    on the other hand , when the phase information is included ( i.e. @xmath188 ) the situation is improved in such a way that squeezing can be detected in both quadratures provided that one of the modes is initially prepared in a squeezed - cat state , i.e. in ecs or yss .",
    "the role of the phase is analyzed in figs .",
    "9a and b where we have plotted the squeezing factors corresponding to @xmath189-component and @xmath124-component , respectively , when the signal and idler modes are initially prepared in ecs . from these figures",
    "we can see that maximum squeezing occurs in @xmath189-component and locates at @xmath190 .",
    "the opposite situation can be observed for the @xmath124-component where squeezing also exists but it is less pronounced and locates at @xmath191 , i.e. the extreme values are exchanged .",
    "such a behaviour in the two quadratures indicates that the uncertainty relation holds .",
    "further , for @xmath192 we obtained similar behaviour , however , the maximum squeezing values would be available in the @xmath124-component .",
    "further similar behaviour can be seen if the other types of cat states are used .",
    "it is remarkable that the behaviour of squeezing in the present interaction is quite different from that for both ecs @xcite and two - mode squeezed coherent states @xcite where for both squeezing exists only in one of the two quadrature components ; perfect squeezing ( i.e. @xmath193 squeezing ) occurs only for the two - mode squeezed coherent states . in conclusion",
    "the squeezing phenomenon discussed here is a manifestation of co - operative effects among the phases of the different components of the system .",
    "furthermore , by controlling the phases in this device , squeezing can be amplified and switched between the two quadratures .",
    "we would like to conclude this subsection by shedding the light on the behaviour of the reduced factorial moments for the compound - mode case . in this case",
    "the antibunched light can be measured if both the signal and idler modes are simultaneously detected by means of two photodetectors and then their outputs are correlated .",
    "generally , reduced factorial moments can evolve to produce nonclassical negative values based on the types of initial cat states .",
    "further , we have checked that the contribution of @xmath49 can not produce antibunched light independently .",
    "these two facts reflect the role of the phase decoherence property discussed above . on the other hand , similar argument as that for the single - mode case can be given here except the case when the two modes are in yss where a slight antibunching can be observed , but only for certain values of the interaction parameters .",
    "10 shows the reduced factorial moments of the compound - mode case for the given values of the parameters . in this figure",
    "we have used the normalized factor @xmath194 , where the nonclassical effect occurs when @xmath195 . from this figure",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the properties of the dissipative parametric amplifier when the signal and idler modes are initially prepared in schrdinger - cat states .",
    "needless to say the present interaction as described by the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) and the density matrix ( [ 8 ] ) is much more complicated than that in the simple case of a harmonic oscillator coupled with the heat bath @xcite@xcite .",
    "after obtaining the solution of the heisenberg ",
    "langevin equations quantum statistics of interacting modes have been investigated based on the normally ordered characteristic functions .",
    "the system of damping oscillators has been assumed to have a flat spectrum and a chaotic distribution .",
    "in general , there are two operations controlling the behaviour of the interaction which are the interference in phase space and the entanglement .",
    "intuitively , the initial macroscopic cat states can not be preserved in the system .",
    "furthermore , for long - time interaction the initial nonclassical effects of the cats are degraded by the amplification dynamics inherent in the system and the cumulative effects of dissipation . excluding dissipation we have shown that if the input to the device are squeezed ( sub - poissonian ) cat states , then the output may be squeezed ( antibunched ) too provided that the interaction time and gain are finite .",
    "furthermore , the device could be used to amplify squeezing in the compound - mode case . on the contrary ,",
    "the well - known role of the parametric amplifier as a source of perfect squeezing in the compound - mode case rather than in single - mode case fades out for input cat states",
    ". the photon - number distribution can exhibit oscillatory behaviour , which is more pronounced in the compound - mode case than in the single - mode case , regardless of the types of the initial cat states .",
    "also we have shown that the decoherence can arise in the system from the decay of the pump and the phase control .    for dissipation case we have considered in detail only two cases which are related to underdamped and overdamped regimes . in these cases",
    "the interaction tends to eliminate the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix and to affect the diagonal elements .",
    "it has been found that the dynamical subsystems ( signal or idler modes ) collapse to the statistical mixture state or thermal state according to whether the underdamped regime or overdamping regime is considered .",
    "further , we have also shown that the single - mode squeezing at nonzero temperature of the environment decreases much faster than that at zero temperature , however , this situation is generally valid for all quantities studied in this paper . in conclusion ,",
    "the losses uniformly distributed over the device deteriorate its operational characteristics .",
    "of course , such deterioration is more pronounced for the overdamped case .",
