    "recently , slow light propagation has attracted a great deal of attention due to the fundamental aspects of nontrivial light pulse manipulation  @xcite and possible applications for optical delay lines  @xcite , for quantum computing and quantum communication @xcite , and for developing sensitive measurement techniques  @xcite .",
    "the experiments for slow light are carried out on various types of materials such as cold sodium atoms  @xcite , atom vapors  @xcite , and solids state system@xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism of slow light is to create a narrow transparency window ( burn a hole ) within the absorption line by an intense coupling laser field .",
    "also a sharp normal dispersion of the refractive index is accompanied within this narrow window .",
    "thus both a low group velocity of light and an enhanced transmission of light can be achieved . a basic way to produce slow light",
    "is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite .",
    "the eit effect usually happens in the so - called @xmath0-type atomic system , which contains two lower states with separate couplings to an excited state through two electromagnetic fields ( probe and control light ) .",
    "when the absorption of light by both transitions is suppressed due to destructive interference between excitation pathways to the upper level , the medium becomes transparent with respect to the probe field .",
    "the group velocity of the light depends on the parameters of the control field  @xcite .",
    "another method to producing slow light is the coherent population oscillation ( cpo )  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the transition is excited by a probe field and a control light from the ground state to the excited state of a two - level system .",
    "the beating due to the slight detuning between pump and probe lights leads to a periodic modulation of the atomic population , which create a narrow spectral dip in the probe absorptive spectrum . due to",
    "its insensitive to the dephasing of the atomic coherence , the slow light has been found at room temperature  @xcite , and its speed can be reduced as low as a few tens of meters per second  @xcite .    actually , the conventional studies of slow - light phenomenon focus on various effects in the time - domain , but most recently , much attention has been paid to light propagation in the spatial domain . the effect of an external field with spatially inhomogeneous distribution has been studied  @xcite . it is found that the light ray bends when a magnetic field with small gradient vertical to the propagation direction is applied to a eit medium  @xcite .",
    "also in a eit medium , the light deflection is explicitly observed when the atomic ensemble is driven by a optical field with an inhomogeneous profile along transverse direction  @xcite .    for the slow light phenomena due to cpo ,",
    "almost all theoretical treatments are confined to the homogeneous transverse spatial distribution of the control field . in this paper",
    ", we address how the spatial profile of the control field along transverse direction affects the propagation of the probe beam for the cpo based slow light . here",
    "we treat the external fields classically .",
    "after investigating the atomic response to the control field and the probe field by the perturbation approach , the spatial motions of the control field is governed by an effective nonlinear schrdinger equation in the low intensity limit .",
    "it is found that the control field can propagate for long distances with an invariant transverse profile . and with an effective potential induced by the steady atomic response ,",
    "the spatial motions of the probe field is described by an effective schrdinger equation in the limits of linear response . and",
    "therefore the deflection of the light ray comes out straightforwardly .",

    "[ sec : two ] , we present the theoretical model for a two - level atomic ensemble interacting with a control field and a much weaker probe field . in sec .  [",
    "sec : three ] , the perturbation theory is applied to obtain the atomic motion equation which is related to the response to the external field . in sec .  [",
    "sec : four ] , we derive a system of equations which govern the spatial motion of the control field and the probe field in the optically controlled atomic medium .",
    "then the deflection of the probe beam is investigated by the transverse spatial profile of the control light . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] , we make our conclusion .",
    "the system for producing slow light by cpo involves three subsystems : the atomic medium , a control field and a weaker signal field .",

    "large detuning is considered . the probe field is slightly detuned from the control field , and it is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the detuning between the control and probe light leads to periodic modulation of the two - level system population oscillation , which substantially reduces the group velocity  @xcite .    as shown in fig .",

    "we consider the ensemble of closed two - level atoms . due to the spontaneous emission",

    "we assume that the upper level @xmath33 decays to the lower level @xmath34 at a rate @xmath35 , which means the lifetime of the upper level is given by @xmath36 .",
    "as the two - level is closed , any population that leaves the upper level enters the ground level .",

    "we also assume that the atomic dipole moment dephases at a rate @xmath38 . by adding decay terms phenomenologically ,",

    "( [ 3 - 03 ] ) can not readily be solved exactly . as the probe field is much weaker than the control field",
    ", we seek a solution to the equations of the atomic motion that is correct to all orders in the amplitude of the control field and is correct to lowest order in the amplitude of the probe field . though the polarization induced by the external fields in the ensemble of two - level atoms is described by the equation    @xmath43    which generally includes components not only at the field frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath30 but also at @xmath45 with @xmath11 integral , only the frequencies @xmath8 , @xmath30 and @xmath46 will occur in the atomic response to lowest order of the amplitude @xmath28 .",

    "most atoms are in the ground state @xmath34 , which means the population difference in thermal equilibrium @xmath66 .",
    "as the detuning usually is much larger than the dephasing rate @xmath67 , we can neglect the imaginary part of the atomic response to the optical fields , then the propagating equations read    [ 4 - 04 ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 has been set and    [ 4 - 05 ] @xmath70the consideration for taking @xmath69 reflects the principle of this problem by the following reasons : 1 ) a resonance occurs at @xmath69 which can be obtained by the inspection of eq .",
