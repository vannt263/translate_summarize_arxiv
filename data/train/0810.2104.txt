    "recent type ia supernova data @xcite confirm , at high significance , that the cosmological expansion is currently accelerating .",
    "if we assume that general relativity is valid on cosmological length scales , this cosmological acceleration requires that the universe s current energy density budget is dominated by far by an approximately spatially uniform component  dark energy  with negative pressure @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dark energy density .",
    "the most economic and the oldest form of dark energy is einstein s cosmological constant @xmath2 @xcite which is time independent and has an equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "the time - independent cosmological constant model ( @xmath2cdm ) provides a reasonably good fit to most current cosmological data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but despite this success a lot of alternative models of dark energy have been proposed over the years .",
    "one reason for this is that cosmological data can not yet tightly constrain the various options currently under debate , although it is thought that in next decade a large amount of more precise new data will tightly constrain or measure departures from the now standard @xmath2cdm model ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .cdm model is based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) structure formation model which might have trouble accounting for some observations ( for a summary of some of the problems see @xcite ) . ]",
    "the second reason is that a cosmological constant is not straightforward to understand on a more fundamental level ; in particular , it is difficult to accept as fundamental the needed new energy scale of a few @xmath4 .    in some scalar field",
    "dark energy models a nonlinear attractor solution ensures that this scale of a few @xmath4 is not fundamental , rather it follows from a much higher energy scale as the scalar field energy density decreases during the cosmological expansion ( @xcite ) . in this paper we also consider this @xmath5cdm model in which the dark energy is modeled as a slowly rolling scalar field @xmath5 with self - interaction potential energy density @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "a number of other models with time - varying dark energy have been proposed .",
    "we also consider the xcdm parametrization which is often used to describe time - varying dark energy models.cdm dark energy at late times ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] in xcdm dark energy is assumed to be a perfect fluid with effective equation of state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a number less than @xmath10 .    given a model it is possible to compute quantities such as the hubble parameter @xmath11 and the angular diameter distance @xmath12 as a function of redshift @xmath13 .",
    "since these quantities are observable ( or observational results depend on them ) , given perfect data it is possible in principle to compare observational results with theoretical predictions and determine which dark energy model provides a better fit to the data .",
    "there are a few difficulties however .",
    "theoretical predictions not only depend on dark energy model parameters , they also can depend on a number of other cosmological parameters , such as the energy density of non - relativistic matter or baryonic matter or radiation , the energy density perturbation spectral index , the total mass of neutrinos , the hubble constant , etc . while some of these parameters are directly measurable , some of them have to be simultaneously determined from the data .",
    "this leads to degeneracies in cosmological parameter space .    the other issue is possible systematic errors in cosmological observations , which are very difficult to trace .",
    "it is therefore reassuring that the supernova data indication of dark energy is confirmed by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data .",
    "more precisely , assuming the cdm model of structure formation and assuming that dark energy does not evolve in time , cmb anisotropy data are consistent with negligible space curvature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so in conjunction with low measured non - relativistic matter density ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cmb anisotropy data also demand dark energy .    to convincingly remove degeneracies and understand and cancel the effect of unwanted systematic errors it s necessary to have many independent cosmological tests .",
    "other recently discussed cosmological probes include the angular size of radio sources and quasars as a function of redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , strong gravitational lensing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , weak gravitational lensing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , measurements of the hubble parameter as a function of redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , galaxy cluster gas mass fraction versus redshift data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the growth of large - scale structure ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a measurement of the large - scale structure baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak length scale provides another possible cosmological test .",
    "this was first measured a few years ago in the two - point correlation function of luminous red galaxies in the sdss catalog at @xmath14 ( @xcite , also see @xcite ) and from 2dfgrs data @xcite , and then later in the joint sdss and 2df catalogs at @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "one attractive feature of the bao measurements is that they do not explicitly depend on the value of hubble constant .",
    "these bao measurements were used in the original papers to constrain parameters of the @xmath2cdm and xcdm models . see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and references therein , for recent discussions of bao data constraints on these and other models .",
    "the @xcite measurement was made at only two redshifts and by itself does not provide a robust and reliable test of dark energy models , but in combination with other data it does provide useful constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "however , a number of surveys are planned in next few years that will measure the bao scale accurately and at a variety of redshifts up to @xmath17 .",
    "this upcoming bao data , especially when combined with other data , will prove very useful in tightly constraining dark energy parameters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite argued that these measurements of the bao scale were essentially measurements orthogonal to the line of sight and so statistically independent from a line of sight measurement of the bao scale , even if the same galaxy catalog is used for both measurements .",
    "@xcite used the sdss data to compute the line of sight or radial bao scale in redshift space for two ranges of redshift and @xcite showed the resulting constraints on the spatially - flat xcdm model .",
    "these constrains from the radial bao scale data are quite similar to the constraints derived from earlier `` non - radial '' bao scale measurements . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to the @xmath2cdm and @xmath5cdm models of dark energy.cdm parameters but do not show constraint contours for @xmath2cdm .",
    "] the data are consistent with spatially - flat @xmath2cdm . however , these current radial bao measurements ( like current non - radial bao measurements ) can not tightly constrain time - varying dark energy , although the situation is anticipated to improve in the next few years .",
    "we also derive constraints on these models from a combined analysis of the radial bao data and the @xcite union type ia supernova data .",
    "since the radial bao and type ia supernova data constraints are almost orthogonal , the constraints from the combined data are significantly tighter than those from either individual data sets .",
    "the combined constraints favor a close to spatially - flat @xmath2cdm model ( more so than the type ia supernova data ) , but do not yet completely rule out time - varying dark energy .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    "we describe the radial bao measurements we use . in sec .",
    "3 we explain how we derive constraints on different dark energy models from radial bao and type ia supernova data .",
    "we present and discuss our results in sec .",
    "in a spherically symmetric universe the two - point correlation function is a function of two variables , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the separation along the line of sight and @xmath20 is the separation on the sky .",
    "it can also be expressed as a function of absolute separation @xmath21 and the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the direction of separation , @xmath22 .",
    "the correlation function can then be decomposed into multipole moments    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 order legendre polynomial .",
    "multipole moments of different orders can be related to each other if one has a complete theory of linear and nonlinear evolution .",
    "although high multipoles that describe the `` shape '' of baryon acoustic oscillation imprints on the matter distribution are very difficult to measure in practice , theoretically they are independent of the monopole and could provide additional structure formation tests .",
    "initial work considered only the averaged over direction monopole part of the correlation function ,    @xmath26    and found a bao peak signal at a comoving distance of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the hubble constant @xmath29 in units of 100 @xmath30 ) .",
    "this measurement was however mostly transverse to the line of sight direction @xmath20 ; the weight of separation along the line of sight contributes less then @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is fair to assume that the radial baryon acoustic peak scale measurement in the line of sight direction from @xmath32 is statistically independent from that measured from @xmath33 , even if the same galaxy sample is used for both measurements .",
    "@xcite recently used sdss data to measure the radial baryon acoustic scale in two redshift ranges @xmath34 with radial bao peak scale @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( both one standard deviation errors ) .",
    "theoretically the radial bao peak scale is given by    @xmath38    where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath13 , @xmath39 is the sound horizon size at the drag redshift @xmath40 , at which baryons were released from photons , and @xmath41 is the speed of light .",
    "@xmath11 can be easily computed in a given cosmological model and depends on model parameters such as the non - relativistic matter density and the time dependence of dark energy .    to compute @xmath42 @xcite use two different methods .",
    "one is to use the ratio @xmath43 between the distance to the last - scattering surface and @xmath42 measured by cmb anisotropy experiments and compute the sound horizon at photon decoupling from    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the redshift at the photon decoupling and @xmath46 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "alternatively , one can use priors on the fractional energy density parameters of baryonic matter , @xmath47 , nonrelativistic matter , @xmath48 , and relativistic matter , @xmath49 , from , e.g. , cmb anisotropy measurements , and compute the sound horizon at the drag redshift from    @xmath50    both options have similar drawbacks .",
    "one has to assume priors on `` nuisance '' parameters like @xmath43 or various energy densities .",
    "cmb anisotropy measurements themselves have measurement errors that must be accounted for , otherwise the errors on the estimates of dark energy model parameters of interest will be underestimated .",
    "also , the best fit values for nuisance parameters given by cmb anisotropy data are in general different for every cosmological model and also depend on model parameter values .",
    "to be fully consistent when using priors one would have to reanalyze cmb experiments for each cosmological model ( and model parameter value ) instead of using a single set of values for @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .    at present , however , the bao scale is measured only in two redshift ranges and does not provide very tight parameter constraints compared to other observational tests . hence , as long as we are interested in preliminary constraints on dark energy from bao scale measurements we may use the simplified approach of @xcite , keeping in mind that when more and better quality bao scale measurements become available a more complete , careful , and time - consuming analysis will be warranted .",
    "we compare the two measured radial bao peak scales @xcite with the predictions of three dark energy models .",
    "the models we consider are standard @xmath2cdm , the xcdm parametrization of the dark energy s equation of state , and the @xmath5cdm model with an inverse power law potential energy density @xmath6 . in these dark energy models , at late times , we can compute the redshift - dependent hubble parameter from    @xmath51    in the @xmath52 model the energy density of the scalar field has to be computed as a function of the redshift and @xmath53 parameter by numerically solving the equations of motion .    in all three models",
    "the background evolution is described by two parameters .",
