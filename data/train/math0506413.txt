    "rotation distance quantifies the difference in shape between two rooted binary trees of the same size by counting the minimum number of elementary changes needed to transform one tree to the other .",
    "search algorithms are most efficient when searching balanced trees , which have few levels relative to the number of nodes in the tree .",
    "thus one is often interested in calculating , or at least bounding , the number of these changes necessary to alter a given tree into another with a more desirable shape , such as a balanced tree .",
    "if we allow these elementary changes , called rotations , to take place at any node , we obtain ordinary rotation distance .",
    "this was analyzed by sleator , tarjan and thurston @xcite , who proved an upper bound of @xmath1 rotations needed to transform one rooted binary tree with @xmath2 nodes into any other , for @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the @xmath1 bound is achieved for all sufficiently large @xmath2 and thus is the best possible upper bound .",
    "no efficient algorithm is known to compute rotation distance exactly , though there are polynomial - time algorithms of pallo @xcite and rogers @xcite which estimate rotation distance efficiently .    here",
    "we expand on the study of restricted rotation distance begun in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "restricted rotation distance allows rotations only at the root node and the right child of the root node .",
    "restricted rotation distance is related to the word length of elements of thompson s group @xmath0 with respect to its standard finite generating set .",
    "this is illustrated in @xcite and involves the interpretation of elements of @xmath0 as pairs of finite binary rooted trees and fordham s method @xcite for computing the word length of an element of @xmath0 with respect to that standard finite generating set directly from such trees .",
    "these methods not only give an effective algorithm to compute restricted rotation distance , but they also give an effective algorithm to find the appropriate rotations which realize this distance .",
    "right and left rotations at a node @xmath4 of a rooted binary tree @xmath5 are defined to be the permutations of the subtrees of @xmath5 described in figure [ fig : rightfig1 ] .",
    "right rotation at a node @xmath4 transforms the original tree @xmath6 , given on the left side of figure [ fig : rightfig1 ] , to the tree @xmath7 on the right side of figure [ fig : rightfig1 ] .",
    "left rotation at a node is the inverse operation . in all that follows , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote trees with the same number of nodes .",
    "transforms @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; similarly , left rotation at node @xmath4 transforms @xmath7 to @xmath6 .",
    "the labels @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent ( possibly empty ) subtrees of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig : rightfig1],width=240 ]    in this paper , we discuss generalizations and variations of restricted rotation distance , in which rotations are again only allowed at specified nodes of the tree .",
    "we relate these distances to distinct word metrics on thompson s group @xmath0 .",
    "we use this interpretation to exhibit linear bounds on the number of allowable elementary rotations needed to transform one tree with @xmath2 nodes into another , and show that these bounds are asymptotically sharp in the sense that the coefficients of the linear terms of the bounds are the best possible .",
    "these alternate definitions all allow rotations at the root node and at nodes connected to the root node by a path consisting entirely of right edges ; that is , nodes that lie on the _ right side _ or _",
    "right arm _ of the tree .",
    "the root node is considered to lie on the right side of the tree .",
    "one complication that arises is that while the original restricted rotation distance is always defined between any two trees with the same number of nodes , this is no longer necessarily the case when we allow rotations at other collections of nodes along the right side of the tree .",
    "some transformations between trees can not be accomplished with a specified set of rotations without the nonstandard technique of adding additional nodes to the trees .",
    "such a transformation is not permitted when computing rotation distances of any type .",
    "below , we describe how to determine when such transformations are possible with a prescribed set of permitted locations at which to rotate .",
    "when this restricted right - arm rotation distance is defined , we provide an upper bound on its magnitude .",
    "the sharp upper bound on the restricted rotation distance between two trees , each with @xmath2 nodes , obtained in @xcite is @xmath11 , for @xmath12 .",
    "below , we consider allowing additional rotations along the right side of the tree and note that allowing rotations at any finite collection of nodes on the right side of the tree does not change the multiplicative constant of 4 in the upper bound .",
    "it is only when we allow an infinite set of rotations along the right arm of the tree that we obtain the multiplicative constant of 2 in the upper bound , analogous to ordinary rotation distance .",
    "these rotation distances and bounds , which hold for sufficiently large @xmath2 , are summarized in table [ tab : summ ] , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes in each tree .",
    "if @xmath15 , then this rotation may change the arm of the tree on which the spinal ancestor of @xmath16 lies . if this is the case , then the first label along the path @xmath17 will change from @xmath18 to @xmath19 or vice versa and @xmath14 will remain @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 then the @xmath22 coordinate remains unchanged , and the @xmath23 coordinate is changed by @xmath24 , depending on the direction of the rotation .",
    "other rotations which do not add carets to the path @xmath17 will not change the labels along @xmath17 . rotations which decrease the length of @xmath17 can only remove the initial label along the path .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ thm : rra - sharpboth ] .",
    "_ first , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath25 is larger than @xmath26 , since if not , we can interchange the left and right sets of generators by taking reflections of the trees considered .",
    "given the set @xmath27 , we define the level furthest from the root on the right side at which a rotation can take place as @xmath28 for convenience and consider the elements with @xmath29 of the form @xmath30    the reduced tree pair diagram @xmath31 for @xmath32 is pictured in figure [ fig : spinalword ] .",
    "each @xmath33 contains @xmath34 carets , with a deeply buried exposed caret in each tree connected to the right - hand side of the tree via a zigzag path . in @xmath6 , we label the caret with the sibling pair @xmath35 $ ] as @xmath16 and in @xmath7 , we label caret with the sibling pair @xmath36 $ ] as @xmath37 .",
    "we see that the lengths of @xmath17 and @xmath38 are both @xmath39 , and have labels @xmath40 .",
    "we begin with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and to split each sibling pair , we need to reduce both @xmath14 and @xmath43 to @xmath44 for some appropriate @xmath45 . as in the right - arm case described above , when counting the needed rotations , we count from the beginning of the transformation to determine the number of rotations needed to separate the sibling pair in caret @xmath16 and from the end of the transformation to determine the number of rotations to separate the pair in caret @xmath37 .    as in the proof of theorem [ thm : rra - sharpfull ] , there are two ways that a single rotation can decrease the @xmath22 coordinate of @xmath14 , which we extract from tables [ tab : right - g(c ) ] and [ tab : left - g(c ) ] .",
    "1 .   rotations which decrease the first coordinate and increase the second .",
    "rotations which decrease the first coordinate and leave the second unchanged",
    ". these can only happen when the spinal ancestor of @xmath16 is on the right arm of the tree and initial two labels of @xmath46 are @xmath47 or when the spinal ancestor of @xmath16 is on the left arm of the tree and initial two labels of @xmath46 are @xmath48 .",
    "we will call these _ bonus _ rotations .",
    "we note that a single rotation which does not increase the @xmath22 coordinate either leaves the labels along @xmath17 unchanged , or removes the initial label .",
    "there is no way for a single rotation to change a label in the middle of the path .",
    "rotation at the root may change the initial label from @xmath19 to @xmath18 or vice versa , or leave all labels unchanged .",
    "we first enlarge our generating set to @xmath49 , so that rotations are permitted at all nodes at levels zero through @xmath25 along the right side of the tree , and at all levels one through @xmath26 along the left side of the tree .",
    "as with theorems [ thm : rra - sharp ] and [ thm : rra - sharpfull ] , if we can produce trees @xmath6 and @xmath7 which require the desired lower bound on the spinal rotation distance @xmath50 , then the same bound holds with respect to @xmath27 , since the removal of elements from the generating set can only increase the spinal rotation distance or cause it to be undefined .",
    "since the elements in our example do not have any generators in their normal forms of index less than @xmath25 , lemma [ lemma : notreducednotdefined ] guarantees that the relevant restricted right - arm rotation distance using just the rotations on the right side of the tree is defined .",
    "thus the restricted spinal rotation distance using the larger set of rotations corresponding to the entire generating set @xmath27 will also be defined .",
    "we now give a lower bound on the minimal number of rotations necessary to separate the sibling pair @xmath35 $ ] in @xmath6 , which we can equivalently view as multiplication by a minimal sequence of generators .",
    "we recall that we must reduce @xmath14 from @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , to @xmath44 for some level @xmath45 at which rotation is allowed on the correct arm of the tree . every rotation , whether at a node on the right or left arm of the tree , which decreases the @xmath22 coordinate of @xmath14 , with the exception of bonus rotations , also increases the @xmath23 coordinate .",
    "the @xmath23 coordinate of @xmath14 begins larger than @xmath25 ( and thus @xmath26 as well ) , and so each non - bonus rotation which reduces the @xmath22 coordinate will require an additional rotation to counteract the corresponding increase in the @xmath23 coordinate .",
    "we now consider the role of bonus rotations that can be used in a minimal length sequence of rotations .",
    "we note that the labels for @xmath17 begin with @xmath53 .",
    "there is no natural occurrence in the sequence of labels of @xmath48 or @xmath47 . in order to create an @xmath48 or @xmath47",
    ", we can use an application of at least one @xmath54 which will change the initial label but will not change @xmath14 .",
    "thus each such bonus rotation would need to be accompanied by an @xmath54 which does not change @xmath14 .      1 .",
    "@xmath57 non - bonus rotations which change the coordinates of @xmath14 , 2 .",
    "@xmath58 bonus rotations which change the coordinates of @xmath14 , and 3 .",
    "@xmath59 rotations which do not change @xmath14 .",
    "the argument above showing that there is at least one @xmath54 accompanying each bonus rotation shows that @xmath60 .",
    "totalling the effects of these @xmath61 rotations , we find that to reduce @xmath56 to @xmath62 with @xmath63 will require at least @xmath64 total rotations , since @xmath34 .",
    "thus , as in lemma [ buriedsibs ] , any sequence of at most @xmath65 rotations applied to tree @xmath6 will have leaves @xmath66 and @xmath67 as sibling pairs .",
    "similarly , working backward and considering tree @xmath7 , we need to change the @xmath42 to @xmath44 with @xmath63 , to be able to affect the sibling pair @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "a similar calculation shows that any sequence of at most @xmath68 rotations applied to the tree @xmath7 will have leaves @xmath67 and @xmath69 as sibling pairs .",
    "so we see that in the sequence of trees @xmath70 exhibiting the transformation of @xmath6 into @xmath7 via rotation , the sibling pair @xmath35 $ ] must be present in the first @xmath65 trees and the sibling pair @xmath36 $ ] must be present in the last @xmath68 trees .",
    "including the rotation to change the sibling pairing of leaf @xmath67 , we see that the spinal rotation distance must be at least @xmath71 .    note that the number of nodes in these trees @xmath2 is constructed to be @xmath72 , so depending upon whether or not @xmath73 is even or odd , the number of nodes in the trees constructed using these examples for increasing @xmath67 will either always be even or always be odd . to obtain examples for all parity @xmath2 larger than @xmath73",
    ", we can repeat the argument above on examples with one additional caret , with normal forms @xmath74 and find that the sibling pair @xmath36 $ ] must be present in the first @xmath75 steps and that the sibling pair @xmath76 $ ] must be present in the last @xmath68 steps , so in those cases the distance between the two trees must be at least @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we have that the bound holds for all @xmath2 larger than @xmath73 and thus the therorem",
