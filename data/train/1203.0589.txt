    "the possibility that gravity may have a significant role at very short distances has attracted significant interest for many years@xcite as well as the feasibility of developing a unified gauge theory of gravitational and strong forces@xcite have been discussed . in the framework of brane theories with non - compact extra dimensions",
    "it is postulated that particles and fields of the standard model are confined to the brane universe , while the graviton is assumed to propagate in the bulk . within the classical framework of this scenario , the confining of a test particle to the brane eliminates the effects of extra dimensions rendering them undetectable . in general ,",
    "non - gravitational forces acting in the bulk ( and orthogonal to the brane ) , are needed in order to keep the test particles moving on the brane , the source of these confining forces being interpreted in different manners . if the notion of confinement must appear in any reasonable theory with non - compact extra dimensions non - gravitational forces can not be excluded a priori . confinement due to oscillatory behavior has been proved in five - dimensional relativity with two times@xcite . indeed , null paths of massless particles in 5d geodesic motion can appear in 4d as time - like paths of massive particles which undergo oscillations in the 5d dimension around the 4d hypersurface .",
    "although the gravitational confinement has been studied many years ago in the framework of kaluza - klein theory@xcite , this issue remains unexplored in the framework of the induced matter theory of gravity@xcite , which is mathematically based on the campbell - magaard theorem@xcite .    in a previous work@xcite",
