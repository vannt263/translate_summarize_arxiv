    "most of the literature analysing cp - violating effects in @xmath0 decays ( with @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 in particular ) deals with quark - diagram short - distance ( sd ) amplitudes and assumes that final state interactions ( fsi ) are negligible . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that this neglect is not justified and that any reliable analysis must take fsi into account @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent analyses seem to show that even in @xmath15 decays fsi must play an important role ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . accordingly",
    ", various authors have tried to estimate fsi in @xmath16 decays by analysing the contribution from elastic or quasi - elastic rescattering @xcite .",
    "the main problem , however , is posed by the sequence @xmath17 involving _ inelastic _ rescattering processes @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denote all kinds of multiparticle states .",
    "arguments have been given that these inelastic processes constitute the main source of soft fsi phases @xcite .",
    "since estimates of the size of these effects are model - dependent , one may envisage various scenarios , with the contributions from different intermediate states cancelling in an approximate way or renormalizing sd prescriptions without changing their form , having random phases @xcite , or adding coherently @xcite , just to mention a few possibilities . with our insufficient knowledge of @xmath20 interactions at @xmath21 , there is virtually no hope that a reliable calculation of inelastic fsi can be performed .",
    "consequently , various authors have argued that perhaps one should try to determine fsi effects directly from the data .",
    "for example , decays @xmath22 are thought to provide a measure on the size of fsi effects @xcite . with many different decay channels and three varieties of @xmath0 mesons ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 )",
    "one may hope that the fsi effects can be untangled , especially if simple su(3)-symmetric fsi is accepted .",
    "as fsi are oblivious of the original decay mechanism , various decays ( for example , independently of whether the decay is strangeness - conserving or changing ) are affected by the same su(3)-symmetric fsi . if these fsi can be described with the help of a few parameters only , one may hope that the number of measurable decay types might be sufficient to permit determination of these parameters .",
    "learning the size of fsi directly from the data would be certainly important as there are various papers which fit the present data on @xmath26 decays both without and with fsi ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the sd approaches attempt to include all strong interaction effects by assigning different phase parameters to different quark - line diagrams ( eg . tree @xmath27 , penguin @xmath28 , etc . ) .",
    "however , it was argued that this prescription violates such tenets of strong interactions as isospin symmetry @xcite .",
    "the origin of the problem pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite is the lack of any ( isospin ) correlation between the spectator quark and the products of @xmath29 quark decay . by its very nature",
    "such correlation can not be provided by sd dynamics .",
    "a long - distance ( ld ) mechanism which ensures that quarks `` know '' about each other must be involved here .",
    "the inelastic rescattering effects considered in the present paper will provide both such a correlation and a generalization of the formulas of ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall show how the standard formulas of the sd approach to @xmath0 decay amplitudes are modified when fsi are not negligible .",
    "in particular , assuming the dominance of sd dynamics by a few ( 2 or 3 ) quark - line amplitudes ( as it is usually done ) we will discuss ways in which deviations from these formulas can be used to indicate the size of inelastic fsi ( ifsi ) .",
    "it will be also shown that rescattering may affect considerations based on analyses of u - spin related decays , including the method of extracting the value of the cp - violating weak angle @xmath9 from @xmath30 decays .",
    "if one accepts that final state interactions can not modify the probability of the original sd weak decay , it follows that vector @xmath31 representing the set of all fsi - corrected amplitudes is related to vector @xmath32 of the original amplitudes driven by the sd dynamics through @xcite : @xmath33 after the sd - driven @xmath16 decay whose description is included in @xmath32 , the @xmath20 pair produced may undergo further scattering into many non-@xmath20 states .",
    "this out - of-@xmath34-channel process provides absorption in the @xmath20 channel , i.e. it reduces the original decay amplitudes .",
    "this is described by ( mainly imaginary ) pomeron exchange contribution in @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "pomeron contributions in direct channels belonging to different su(3 ) multiplets are related using @xmath37 symmetry of the quark diagram approach .",
    "this approach relates absolute magnitudes and phases of fsi amplitudes in various direct channels corresponding to different su(3 ) multiplets .",
    "( su(3 ) itself , on the other hand , relates amplitudes only within - but not between - these channels . ) for pomeron , the fsi effects in all possible su(3 ) channels ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) are identical .",
    "thus , pomeron exchange between departing pseudoscalar mesons amounts to rescaling down the overall size of all quark - line decay amplitudes without modifying any other sd predictions .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 sd decay processes lead directly also to non-@xmath20 states composed of two higher - mass states ( resonances ) @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the latter may rescatter into @xmath20 yielding an `` indirect '' contribution to @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the set of fsi - corrected decay amplitudes @xmath45 $ ] is composed of the direct and indirect parts as follows ( amplitudes @xmath46 are already absorption - rescaled ) : @xmath47 where the indirect contributions are described by the sum on the r.h.s . in eq.([dirplusresc ] ) the subscripts denote decay channels rather schematically : @xmath48 are su(3)-related indices , while @xmath49 labels inelastic channels . in this paper",
    "we are interested in finding the pattern of inelastic fsi contributions following the original sd decay @xmath41 .",
    "rescattering from the @xmath42-generated intermediate states leads to charming penguins @xcite , whose amplitudes may be added to those of sd penguins in the final formulas .    formally ,",
    "the choice of decay channels @xmath50 ( i.e. a basis in the flavour space ) is irrelevant , and one may use either a cartesian basis ( where all mesons in @xmath20 states have definite @xmath51 content ) , or su(3 ) basis ( in which @xmath50 correspond to - belonging to different su(3 ) multiplets - linear combinations of @xmath52 ) . however , as resonances appear only in the octet channel , fsi in the octet and the 27-plet channels are different .",
    "consequently , it is natural to use the su(3 ) basis , only at the end transforming everything to the basis of interest .",
    "consider now the simple case when su(3 ) is replaced by su(2 ) and @xmath53 label su(2 ) multiplets . furthermore , in order to simplify the argument , let us assume that for all @xmath54 one has @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "clearly , we must have @xmath57 with @xmath58 complex in general .",
    "one obtains then @xmath59 if @xmath60 for all @xmath50 , one has @xmath61 , i.e. all fsi - induced modifications are contained in one , experimentally not discernible , overall complex factor @xmath62 , identical for all isopin channels .",
    "if strong interactions in different isospin channels are different ( i.e. @xmath63 for @xmath64 ) , the differences between @xmath58 s will lead to a modification of the sd pattern : the magnitudes and phases of fsi effects will depend on isospin .",
    "one expects the su(3 ) case to be similar : for an appropriate choice of @xmath65 s in eq.([dirplusresc ] ) , no fsi should be discernible in the final @xmath66 amplitudes .",
    "modifications of the predictions of the sd quark - line approach may appear only when fsi in different su(3 ) channels differ from this particular choice .",
    "the relevant conditions on the su(3 ) analogues of @xmath67 are derived in section 4 .",
    "in this paper we accept su(3 ) in both direct and indirect terms as we do not attempt to fit any data as yet . when doing the latter , su(3 ) breaking should probably be first introduced in the direct term , as one may argue that no corrections to corrections ( i.e. no su(3)-breaking in fsi effects ) should be considered in the first attempt .",
    "our conventions and definitions for the ( final , symmetrized ) @xmath20 states are given in the appendix , where @xmath20 states with mesons of definite charges , @xmath20 states of definite isospin , and @xmath20 states belonging to definite su(3 ) multiplets ( i.e. direct - channel su(3 ) eigenstates ) are listed .    in quasi - elastic fsi",
    "the intermediate state is also a @xmath20 state , and thus the intermediate mesons have to be symmetrized . in the inelastic case the original sd weak decay produces two @xmath51 pairs , which transform into a pair of resonances @xmath68 .",
    "these @xmath43 and @xmath69 mesons are different in general ( we neglect the case when the two mesons are identical as the bulk of inelastic rescattering must come from @xmath70 ) .",
    "we may define @xmath43 to be the state of lower mass . in the appendix we call the first ( second ) meson @xmath43 ( @xmath69 ) a @xmath28 ( @xmath71 ) meson . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath71 are only labels denoting different su(3 ) multiplets of mesons , such as pseudoscalar , vector , axial , tensor etc .",
    "( including heavier and heavier ) mesons . with @xmath72 ,",
    "there is no need to symmetrize . in particular",
    ", the @xmath73 states do not have to be symmetric in su(3 ) indices .",
    "thus , while in the case of quasi - elastic fsi the mesons @xmath71 and @xmath28 are both pseudoscalars and only states @xmath74 ( with @xmath28 representing a pseudoscalar and @xmath75 , @xmath29 being su(3 ) indices ) are admissible , in general we must distinguish cases when @xmath76 and @xmath77 . using the @xmath73 labels to denote all such situations , the appendix lists all the relevant @xmath73 states in the su(3 ) basis . in the preparation of this list",
    "one has to consider both su(3)-symmetric and su(3)-antisymmetric combinations of octet mesons @xmath28 and @xmath71 in particular . in order to prevent any misunderstanding",
    ", we note that the replacement @xmath78 has nothing to do with this su(3 ) ( anti)symmetrization : indices @xmath28 , @xmath71 do not belong to the su(3 ) group as is explicit in the appendix .",
    "note that while the @xmath40-plet can be obtained only in the @xmath79 @xmath73 channel , the octet may be obtained not only as a symmetric or antisymmetric combination of two octets , but also from a singlet @xmath28 and octet @xmath71 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "similar possibilities exist for the singlet @xmath73 channel .",
    "since in each of these @xmath73 channels ( @xmath80 ; ( @xmath81 , etc . )",
    "rescattering of generally unknown form may take place , one is forced to use a free parameter to describe fsi in each such given channel .",
    "this proliferation of free parameters constitutes the main obstacle on the way of their determination from data .",
    "possible types of sd diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath27 ( tree ) , @xmath82 ( colour - suppressed ) , @xmath28 ( penguin ) , @xmath83 ( singlet penguin ) amplitudes only these diagrams are shown in which short - distance @xmath29 decay consists in the emission of meson @xmath84 off the decaying quark line ( i.e. when the spectator quark is not taken into account ) .",
    "these amplitudes are denoted by @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , ... for strangeness - conserving processes ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , ... for strangeness - changing processes ) .",
    "when short - distance @xmath29 decay produces meson @xmath91 , the corresponding amplitudes ( not shown in fig.1 ) are denoted by @xmath92 , @xmath93 etc .",
    "( @xmath85 does not have to be equal to @xmath92 ) .",
    "although we keep the distinction between @xmath94 and @xmath95 as well as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , in these cases quarks produced in @xmath98 should enter @xmath28 and @xmath71 mesons with equal probabilities .",
    "for the penguin annihilation amplitudes ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) there does not seem to be any reason why @xmath101 or @xmath102 , hence @xmath99 and @xmath100 do not carry a subscript .    with the above preparations , the amplitudes for strangeness - conserving @xmath103 ( strangeness - violating @xmath104 ) decays into quasi - two - body `` @xmath68 '' su(3 ) channels may be calculated in terms of unprimed ( primed ) sd quark - line amplitudes @xmath105 , @xmath106 , ...",
    "( @xmath107 , @xmath108 , ... ) .",
    "we label channels by their su(3 ) and isospin characteristics , e.g. @xmath109 denotes an isospin-1 octet channel formed as an antisymmetric combination of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    with the channels being specified on the l.h.s . and",
    "denoting @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and similarly for the primed amplitudes , one obtains the following expressions    \\a ) for @xmath23 decays @xmath117 b ) for @xmath118 decays @xmath119 c ) for @xmath120 decays @xmath121",
    "usually , the sd quark - diagram analyses of @xmath16 decays start with an assumption that only two or three diagrams types are dominant , while the remaining ones are negligible .",
    "thus , in strangeness - conserving ( @xmath122 ) decays one expects the hierarchy @xmath123 @xcite , while in the strangeness - violating decays one expects @xmath124 . denoting the amplitudes for decays into a given @xmath68 state with superscript @xmath125",
    ", we substitute in eqs.([eq4]-[eq6 ] ) @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc .",
    "since at the level of short - distance decay it is not yet decided whether the particular quark - level state will hadronize as the @xmath20 state or one of the @xmath68 states , one expects that quark - level amplitudes for the @xmath128 and @xmath16 transitions exhibit the same hierarchy pattern .",
    "thus , transition amplitudes @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 should satisfy @xmath132 with @xmath27 , @xmath82 , @xmath28 now describing transitions into pseudoscalar pairs , and analogously for primed amplitudes ( @xmath133 takes care of an overlap between quark - level and hadron - level states )",
    ".    we will consider ifsi corrections resulting from the inelastic rescattering of the @xmath68 states generated by these dominant amplitudes ( @xmath134 ) and ( @xmath135 ) into @xmath20 .",
    "we will not keep any other terms , even though there are known problems with the description of @xmath136 decays , which indicate that in these decays the contributions from singlet penguin amplitudes may be significant .",
    "one expects , however , that contributions in which intermediate states are generated by zweig - rule - violating sd amplitudes should be negligible for general ( non-@xmath20 ) inelastic states .",
    "we describe inelastic final state interactions by introducing several free parameters as follows : @xmath137    upper indices label inelastic intermediate states in the direct channel ( some @xmath138 may be zero ) .",
    "let us now consider as an example the @xmath23 decay into the @xmath40-plet @xmath20 state .",
    "one calculates that ( with the direct term already including absorption - induced rescaling ) @xmath139 using @xmath140 etc .",
    ", the above equation may be reduced to @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "we observe that the original amplitude has been multiplied by an inessential complex factor @xmath143 , which may be absorbed into the definition of @xmath27 and @xmath82 .    following the above example",
    ", one introduces parameters @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "as these parameters are free , in order to keep the formulas simple we define some of the parameters with additional purely numerical factors included .",
    "one may expect that @xmath150 and @xmath151 are roughly similar .",
    "thus , fsi - induced contributions proportional to the difference @xmath152 should be smaller than those proportional to @xmath153 .",
    "consequently , for simplicity we shall assume that @xmath154 .",
    "proceeding as in the example leading to eq.([sum ] ) , we may derive ( after transforming to the basis in which final mesons are in states of definite charge ) : @xmath155 where @xmath156 the above equations reduce to standard sd prescriptions ( with an overall factor of @xmath143 ) when @xmath157 , i.e. when @xmath158 .",
    "this is the explicit form of the condition for no observable fsi effect , mentioned in section 2 .",
    "having presented the general idea , we now list all the relevant formulas .",
    "the decays in which at least one pseudoscalar produced is @xmath159 or @xmath160 involve additional uncertainties at the direct level .",
    "consequently , using these decays to help untangle the fsi is risky .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to @xmath0 decays into @xmath4 , @xmath161 , and @xmath2 .    in the @xmath6 sector , keeping only the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath82 terms , we have @xmath162 where the influence of fsi in the singlet channel is parametrized through @xmath163    similarly , in the @xmath104 sector ( keeping only the dominant @xmath164 , @xmath165 in the fsi contribution ) we have : @xmath166 equations ( [ strangecons],[strangeviol ] ) quantify explicitly what is already well known , i.e. that the presence of significant fsi can be seen most directly in @xmath167 and @xmath168 .    for any fsi",
    "the above formulas satisfy the following three triangle relations @xcite :",
    "@xmath169 alternatively , one of the three relations above may be replaced by the isospin relation @xmath170 ( not independent of the previous three ) .    in the @xmath104 sector",
    "we have the following relations @xmath171 as discussed in @xcite , with the first two relations leading to @xmath172 all these relations are fsi - independent .",
    "consequently , although the same five unknown complex parameters @xmath173 ( i=1, ... 5 ) enter into both @xmath6 and @xmath104 sectors , the number of all independent and in principle measurable data ( i.e. decay widths ) is not sufficient to determine all these parameters , unless some additional input ( like knowledge of sizes and relative phases of @xmath174 and @xmath175 and/or @xmath176 s , assumption of higher - symmetry relations between @xmath176 s , or justified neglect of some terms ) is accepted .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was argued that quark - diagram parametrization in which @xmath165 and @xmath164 are given strong phases @xmath177 and @xmath178 is not compatible with isospin invariance , unless @xmath179 ( see also ref.@xcite ) .    from the previous section",
    "we have @xmath180    this should be compared with the approach of @xcite which , after adjustment to our notation , inclusion of weak phase @xmath9 into the definition of @xmath165 , @xmath181 , and the neglect of @xmath181 terms , yields ( the first two equations below are eqs.(6a,6b ) of @xcite , @xmath182 ) : @xmath183 we see that the two sets of equations ( [ our ] ) and ( [ weyers ] ) are identical if we make the following replacements @xmath184 and appropriately choose @xmath185 and @xmath186 , separately in each of the rightmost ( and proportional to @xmath165 ) terms in eqs.([our ] ) . the need for separate choices results from the oversimplified prescription for fsi used in @xcite : a naive multiplication of quark - diagram amplitudes for @xmath187 and @xmath188 by two different phases only .",
    "the latter prescription does not allow for differences in various @xmath187 phases ( e.g. from @xmath40 and from @xmath39 , see also ref.@xcite ) , or possible different changes in the absolute size of the amplitudes .",
    "still , the general conclusion of @xcite is correct : quark - diagram parametrization in which @xmath164 and @xmath165 are given different strong phases is compatible with isospin symmetry in the @xmath30 decay channel only if terms proportional to @xmath189 ( corresponding to @xmath190 ) are neglected . as one expects that @xmath191 , neglecting @xmath189 terms might seem a reasonable approximation for strangeness - violating @xmath30 decays .",
    "however , when @xmath104 decays @xmath192 are also considered , a glance at eqs([strangeviol ] ) shows that different modifications of @xmath164 are needed there .    for @xmath6 decays ,",
    "the dominant fsi - induced correction terms should be proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "eqs([strangecons ] ) show then that fsi - induced terms proportional to @xmath27 enter different amplitudes with different coefficients and no universal renormalization of quark - level amplitudes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath82 can work . in general",
    ", therefore , parametrization of fsi effects by endowing quark - diagram amplitudes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath82 with additional universal phases can not take the whole complexity of fsi into account .",
    "if final - state interactions may be treated as a correction to the direct sd amplitudes , it seems natural to keep leading terms only in such a correction . assuming then that @xmath173 are all of similar sizes",
    ", we may neglect in eqs.([strangecons],[strangeviol ] ) all fsi - induced terms but the leading ones , i.e. those proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus , the @xmath6 decay amplitudes depend on four @xmath173 ( @xmath193 drops out ) , while the @xmath104 amplitudes on two @xmath173 : @xmath186 and @xmath193 .    in the @xmath194 sector , with amplitudes still depending on four @xmath173 , no relations between amplitudes in addition to those of eq.([trianglecons ] ) are generated .",
    "the number of undetermined parameters is too large to permit their clear - cut determination from data .",
    "thus , additional input is necessary .    in the @xmath104 sector",
    "it is instructive to rewrite the amplitudes in terms of redefined quark - diagram amplitudes : @xmath195 and @xmath196 one then obtains @xmath197 note that the first four equations above have the structure used in the sd quark - diagram approach : the fsi effects can be identified only with additional help from @xmath120 decays . with eight decays and four parameters ( @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 )",
    "there are four relations between the amplitudes .",
    "in addition to the three relations of eqs.([triangleviol],[quadrangle ] ) , we have one new relation involving @xmath202 : @xmath203 this relation yields information on the phase of the fsi - related parameter @xmath204 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath205 measures the ( relative ) size of observable fsi effects .",
    "in the sd quark - diagram approach the @xmath6 and @xmath104 decay amplitudes are related .",
    "consequently , simultaneous analyses of these amplitudes have been considered as a means to provide important tests of the approximations made in the sd approach , and as a way to extract weak angle @xmath9 .",
    "an important question is how such analyses are affected by fsi effects .",
    "it appears that rescattering may upset expectations related to @xmath207 flavor @xmath208-spin reflection arguments @xcite . consider for example the amplitudes for the four decays @xmath209 introducing @xmath210 in addition to @xmath211 ( eq.([primed ] ) ) , the amplitudes for the first two ( @xmath6 ) decays in eq.([ptanddelta ] ) may be reexpressed as @xmath212 when the fsi - induced terms proportional to @xmath82 are neglected .",
    "note that we have kept terms of order @xmath213 even though they represent nonleading fsi effects .",

    "( actually , using the substitutions @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and the analogous ones for the @xmath104 transitions , we could have started our calculations from sd amplitudes corrected for electroweak penguins . ) since one expects that @xmath226 , and @xmath227 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , any such contributions have to be neglected in our approximation . only the @xmath228 terms",
    "( of order @xmath165 ) should be included in the non - fsi - induced terms in eqs.([ptanddelta ] ) .",
    "however , in fsi - induced terms the corrections from the @xmath228 should be neglected if those from @xmath165 are .",
    "thus , when terms of order @xmath229 ( in @xmath230 and @xmath231 ) are kept , but those of order @xmath232 ( in @xmath10 and @xmath233 ) are neglected , our final form of eqs.([tildeunprimed],[tildeprimed ] ) is @xmath234 with @xmath235 , @xmath236 defined in eq.([eq28 ] ) , @xmath237 defined in eq.([primed ] ) and @xmath238 defined in eq.([ttildeprimed ] ) . in eqs.([finalfalkgr ] ) a part of rescattering effects is included into the definition of effective `` penguin '' and `` tree '' amplitudes @xmath235 , @xmath237 and @xmath236 , @xmath238 through a common multiplicative factor of @xmath239 .",
    "it is only the term @xmath240 in the expression for @xmath241 ( and a similar one in @xmath242 ) which represents `` visible '' fsi effects ( i.e. those not removable through a redefinition of @xmath28 , @xmath27 amplitudes ) .",
    "this term may influence the equality @xmath243 obtained ( for su(3 ) symmetric @xmath28 and @xmath164 ) either when charming penguins are dominant , or in sd approaches when @xmath244 ( see later ) .",

    "combined analysis of decays @xmath10 , @xmath233 , and @xmath12 ( together with their cp counterparts ) was proposed in ref.@xcite as a means to provide information on the value of the @xmath262-violating angle @xmath9 . from the form of the expressions for relevant amplitudes in the presence of fsi ( the last three equations in eqs.([finalfalkgr ] ) ) , we see that rescattering might affect the determination of @xmath9 ( see also @xcite ) : the fsi - induced term in the @xmath263 amplitude is of the order of @xmath264 of the penguin amplitude @xmath28 , i.e. twice the size of a similar term in @xmath265 .",
    "thus , if rescattering effects in @xmath265 are substantial , one should seriously worry about the fsi corrections to the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite , using unitarity of the ckm matrix , i.e. @xmath266  , only the @xmath267 part of the penguins is included into the redefined penguins @xmath268 and @xmath269 : @xmath270 with @xmath271 while the @xmath272 parts are absorbed into the redefined tree amplitudes @xmath273 , @xmath274 @xmath275 with @xmath276 the approximation of ref.@xcite consists in neglecting the @xmath277 terms in the expression relating @xmath164 and @xmath269 , i.e. it corresponds to @xmath278 @xcite .    with fsi taken into account , by replacing the @xmath279 terms with @xmath280 , where @xmath281 is related to @xmath238 through an analogon of eqs([tt ] ) , and with @xmath282 , we have @xmath283 if the charming penguins of ref.@xcite are substantial , they may be included into the definition of @xmath284-independent parts of redefined penguins above , effectively suppressing the @xmath284-dependent parts ( and leading to eq([annihilation ] ) ) .",
    "in the following formulas we accept that @xmath284 is small , so that terms proportional to @xmath285 may be neglected ; in reality , a nonzero value of @xmath284 would have to be used in any attempt to extract the angle @xmath9 from data on the basis of eqs([final ] ) @xcite .",
    "the equality @xmath286 , expected to hold ( for any @xmath284 ) in su(3 ) @xcite between the cp - violating rate pseudo - asymmetries @xmath287 and @xmath288 may be affected by fsi even when the latter is su(3 ) symmetric . indeed , using eqs.([final ] )",

    "similar effects of apparent su(3 ) breaking are observed for other pairs of u - spin - related decays . according to eqs.([strangecons],[strangeviol ] ) , when @xmath307 and @xmath99 ( @xmath308 and @xmath309 ) sd amplitudes are neglected , the processes @xmath167 and @xmath310 , related to one another by this reflection , are described by rescattering - induced amplitudes : @xmath311 if @xmath312 were equal to @xmath313 , we would indeed expect for @xmath314 that @xmath315 as obtained in sd approaches .",
    "however , as one expects that @xmath316 with dominant @xmath27- and @xmath164- terms , relation ( [ uspinkkpipi ] ) may be violated .",
    "thus , eq.([uspinkkpipi ] ) may help distinguish between rescattering effects and genuine short - distance @xmath307 and @xmath99 contributions .",
    "a look at eqs.([strangecons],[strangeviol ] ) shows that the method of ref.@xcite , based on the u - spin - related decays @xmath317 and @xmath318 , is also affected by rescattering .",
    "indeed , keeping only the dominant fsi - induced terms ( i.e. those proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath164 ) introduces two unrelated linear combinations of @xmath176 s into the game .",
    "thus , fsi - induced modifications of this method are less easily controlled than those of ref.@xcite .",
    "when specific models for rescattering relations ( and thus , definite relations between @xmath176 s ) are considered , further relations between fsi - induced corrections to various decays should appear .",
    "the analysis of such models and their predictions is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper we analysed the influence of su(3)-symmetric inelastic rescattering onto the predictions of short - distance quark - diagram approach to @xmath319 decays into two pseudoscalars @xmath20 when the tree and penguin amplitudes are assumed dominant .",
    "final - state interactions were described with the help of a few parameters corresponding to all possible su(3)-symmetric forms of inelastic rescattering into @xmath20 .",
    "we found that the combined set of experimental data on all @xmath320 decays is not sufficient to determine all relevant fsi - related parameters .",
    "still , some important information on inelastic fsi effects may be extracted from the data . apart from providing explicit expressions for the amplitudes of",
    "the fsi - driven decays @xmath167 , @xmath310 , and @xmath321 , it was shown that the @xmath104 decays may provide quantitative information on the magnitude and phase of the single fsi - indicating effective parameter appearing in this sector .",
    "fsi - induced modification of the connection between @xmath230 and @xmath10 amplitudes was also given explicitly .",

    "in particular , by modifying the sd prescription for the amplitudes of @xmath10 , @xmath233 , and @xmath12 decays , fsi may affect the method of determining the cp - violating angle @xmath9 , which uses the corresponding decay rates as input .",
