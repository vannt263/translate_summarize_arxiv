    "the majority of metals crystallize from the melt in the open body - centered cubic structure , and the largest part of those transforms martensitically to a close - packed structure at lower temperatures .",
    "while the latter fact has been understood since a long time as the optimal solution to the electrostatic attraction between valence electrons and ionic cores subject to closed - shell repulsion @xcite , proposals to motivate the preference for the open structure at high temperatures have been controversial .",
    "the classical explanations due to zener @xcite and friedel @xcite identify the gain in vibrational entropy due to specific low - energy phonons to be responsible , a view which is shared by the majority of later numerical calculations @xcite ( but see ref .   for a conflicting result ) .",
    "direct experimental studies , where available , confirm the dominant contribution of vibrational entropy for the thermodynamic stability of bcc structures at high temperatures , e.g. , for the transition metals of group 3 and 4 @xcite , and the general necessity of considering the role of vibrations in the thermodynamics of materials , specifically at high temperatures , is recognized @xcite .",
    "the polymorphism of iron , a system with strong magnetic interactions , is of particular interest in this context .",
    "pure iron solidifies at @xmath5 in the bcc @xmath2-phase and undergoes a first transition to fcc @xmath1-fe at @xmath6 . very unusual , with decreasing temperature it transforms back to the bcc @xmath0-phase at @xmath7 .",
    "within the @xmath0-phase a magnetic transition occurs at @xmath8 , below of which @xmath0-fe is ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the bcc @xmath0-phase is understood in the framework of band magnetism @xcite as being due to ferromagnetic contributions to the total energy , which can be reproduced by density - functional calculations in the generalized - gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the proposal of the 2@xmath1-state model @xcite , the dominant view nowadays is that with the loss of magnetic correlations at higher temperatures a single paramagnetic fcc @xmath1-phase results , as it corresponds to the non - magnetic structure of lowest total energy @xcite .",
    "the small region of paramagnetic @xmath0-fe is thought to be due to the persistence of local moments even above @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "more controversial are explanations for the @xmath10 transition , i.e. , the question why fe adopts again bcc in its high temperature phase . published records of theoretical calculations focussing either purely on the electronic @xcite or vibrational @xcite contribution to the entropy generally find that the effect considered in the respective studies suffices for explaining the observed behaviour , while semi - empirical fits to experimental data ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) favor electronic reasons ( but see ref .   for an overview of the widely differing assumptions in such approaches ) .",
    "part of the interest in the @xmath2-phase is due to the fact that a paramagnetic bcc structure with reduced lattice constant is also proposed for the earth inner core , stabilized by vibrational entropy @xcite .    by measuring the phonon dispersion of @xmath2-fe for the first time together with temperature - dependent dispersions for @xmath0- as well as @xmath1-fe we are able to determine the vibrational entropy of the distinct ambient - pressure iron phases purely from experiment and to evaluate the role of vibrational entropy in stabilizing the high - temperature phases .",
    "several large single crystals of the @xmath2-phase with a typical size of 40 to @xmath11 in length and @xmath12 in diameter were grown from high purity ( 4n ) fe rods by the zone melting technique using our combined single crystal growth and measuring furnace @xcite . after the _ in - situ _ growth on the three - axis spectrometer they were kept continuously above the transition temperature @xmath13 . to suppress evaporation of the sample over the course of the measurement (",
    "the evaporation rate under vacuum at @xmath14 was estimated to @xmath15 ) a high purity argon atmosphere of @xmath16 was used .",
    "the temperature could be stabilized within @xmath17 with a gradient along the single crystalline part of the sample of about @xmath18 .",
    "the absolute temperature was calibrated by the known transition temperatures @xmath19 and @xmath13 .",
    "high purity single crystals of the @xmath0-phase with @xmath20 in diameter and variable length were grown by recrystallization at the max - planck - institut fr metallforschung , stuttgart .",
    "a standard resistance furnace has been used to heat the crystals under vacuum with an accuracy of @xmath21 .",
    "heating these @xmath0-fe single crystals into the @xmath1-phase transformed them to a nearly perfect _ powder _ ( polycrystalline ) sample .",
    "however , cycling approximately ten times through the @xmath0-@xmath1 transition finally led to the growth of a @xmath22 @xmath1-single crystal by recrystallization .",
    "the measurements in the @xmath2-phase were performed at the three - axis spectrometer 1 t at the llb , saclay , in the @xmath0-phase at spectrometer e7 at the hmi , berlin and those in the @xmath1-phase at spectrometer in3 at the ill , grenoble .",
    "for all measurements a pyrolytic graphite monochromator and analyzer were used in constant final wave - vector mode .",
    "the phonon dispersions of bcc iron were measured at @xmath23 , @xmath8 , @xmath24 ( preliminarily published in ref .  ) and @xmath14 . in the @xmath1-phase experiments",
    "were done at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "all measurements cover the main symmetry directions and , for the bcc phases , additionally the @xmath27 $ ] direction .",
    "the obtained phonon frequencies are presented in figure [ disp ] ( see the supplemental material @xcite for the data ) . within the bcc - phases a softening of the entire phonon dispersion",
    "is observed when passing from room temperature ( cp .",
    "refs .  ) to @xmath19 .",
    "most pronounced , however , is the decrease of the transverse branches t@xmath4 $ ] and t@xmath28 $ ] , reducing to a value of 53% at the zone boundary in the @xmath2-phase compared to room temperature .",
    "this softening has a nonlinear temperature dependence , particularly around the ferromagnetic transition as observed earlier @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent finite - temperature ab - initio calculations show that a variety of independent phenomena can give rise to this effect : dynamical mean - field theory @xcite ( treating electronic excitations ) , density - functional theory under disordered local moment paramagnetism @xcite as well as self - consistent lattice dynamics @xcite ( treating anharmonic effects ) agree that the softening with temperature is strongest for this branch",
    ". our data also display an increase of the linewidth of these phonons with increasing temperature in the order of @xmath29 , however the damping of transverse phonons in the @xmath0-phase is considerably smaller than in the @xmath2-phase .",
    ".force constants in n / m estimated by bayesian inference from the phonon dispersion of fe at various temperatures in the bcc phases with a born - von krmn model taking into account interactions up to the fifth neighbour shell .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]         the recommended values for the experimental total latent heat are @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite . extrapolating our data to the transition temperatures gives the respective contributions of the vibrational entropies as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the differences in internal vibrational energy are only @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these figures show that at the @xmath36 transition about @xmath37 per atom are taken up by the electronic system , as the bcc - phase is energetically still stabilized by magnetic fluctuations .",
    "this increase in internal energy is compensated by an increase in entropy , to which the phononic subsystem contributes slightly less than half of the value , the rest being made up by electronic contributions ( due to the loss of correlations ) . at the @xmath10 transition the situation is different : due to the increased temperature , the stabilizing effect of the magnetic fluctuations is lost , and the high - temperature phase again costs in internal electronic energy ( @xmath38 per atom ) . comparing our deduced value of @xmath39 with the total entropy difference of @xmath40",
    "shows that this transition is now driven nearly exclusively by the increased vibrational entropy of the open bcc structure .",
    "the smallness of the electronic contribution to the entropy is probably due to the electronic structures of both phases being only weakly correlated .",
    "note that our determination of @xmath41 probably even underestimates the actual value , as in the high - temperature bcc phases typically a hardening of selected phonons with increasing temperature is found , resulting in _ increasing _ debye temperatures @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we find , by measuring for the first time the phonon response in the high temperature bcc phase of fe , that the stabilization of the @xmath2-phase is due to the vibrational entropy of transverse phonons of particular low energy , favoring the picture of a first order transition driven by vibrational entropy @xcite .",
    "this result is in full accordance with what we have found for the bcc phases in the nonmagnetic group 3 and 4 metals , but is more surprising for @xmath2-fe , where magnetic fluctuations have been suspected to stabilize the body - centered cubic phase @xcite .",
    "note that also the high - temperature bcc phase of ce , another example of a system with a complex phase diagram due to magnetic interactions , has experimentally been found to be stabilized by vibrational entropy @xcite , giving weight to the hypothesis that _ in general _ , the existence of high - temperatur bcc phases is due to vibrational entropy .    for the low temperature bcc structure of fe",
    "we find that magnetic contributions establish the ferromagnetic ground state and are responsible for the structural change in the paramagnetic regime , but also for this transition there is a significant vibrational contribution to stabilize fcc - fe .",
