    "clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized objects in the universe , and contain valuable information of the universe and of the large - scale structure .",
    "there have been intensive studies on clusters from different approaches , such as strong and weak gravitational lensing , x - ray , and optical observations . with the technical advents of interferometers , the cluster s sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1980 ; birkinshaw 1999 , carlstrom et al .",
    "1999 ) , a spectral distorsion of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) due to scattering of cmb photons by hot electrons within clusters , has been becoming a new probe for the cluster study .",
    "as cmb photons pass through intracluster hot electrons , on average they gain energies through the inverse - compton scattering , and as a result of this , the number of low energy photons decreases while the number of high energy ones increases .",
    "thus for observations with the frequency @xmath19 , hot clusters behave like emitting sources ( absorbers ) of photons .",
    "the equivalent temperature increment ( or decrement ) @xmath20 of cmb photons toward clusters is proportional to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number density of electrons , @xmath23 is the hot gas temperature , and @xmath24 is the line element along the line of sight .",
    "the integrated sz effect of a cluster is then directly proportional to the cluster s gas mass if the gas is close to be isothermal .",
    "therefore the integrated sz effect is not sensitive to the lumpy structures of the gas and the gas fraction can be estimated relatively clean from the sz effect in conjunction with lensing observations ( e.g. , grego et al . 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , because of the different dependence on @xmath22 of the cluster s x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the x - ray cooling function ) and of the sz effect , the angular diameter distance to a cluster can be derived directly from a joint analysis of the x - ray emission and the sz effect through modeling the gas density profile properly ( e.g. , reese et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "apart from the sze studies for individual clusters , statistical investigations on large number of sze clusters can also yield very promising results .",
    "in fact several interferometric arrays have been proposed for surveying sze clusters , including the amiba ( array for microwave background ) project which has been founded in taiwan . due to the frequency ( energy ) redshift dependence of the cmb photons ,",
    "the sz effect is independent of the redshift , which permits a sze cluster survey to detect very high redshift clusters with relative ease .",
    "therefore the cluster redshift evolution can be studied with high statistical significance .",
    "another advantage of the sze cluster studies over those of x - ray is that the integrated sz effect of an individual cluster is directly proportional to the gas mass within the cluster ( assuming the gas is isothermal ) , which is in turn related to the total mass of the cluster , and the number of sze clusters can be predicted analytically from the press - schechter formula ( or other similar models ) in a straightforward manner with certain qualifications . by contrast , because of the @xmath27 dependence of the x - ray surface brightness , the gas density profile has to be modeled in the x - ray studies to estimate flux - limited x - ray cluster number counts analytically , a procedure that can introduce large uncertainties ( the prediction on the number of temperature - limited x - ray clusters suffers less problem ) .",
    "one may investigate both aspects of clusters with numerical simulations , but finite numerical resolutions and box sizes ultimately limit their applications , and the analytical analysis can be complementary .    among other promising aspects , the redshift distribution of sze clusters can be used to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the redshift distribution of sze clusters with @xmath28 is distinctly different from those with @xmath29 , and the existence of several sze clusters at redshift @xmath30 would strongly exclude the @xmath28 model .",
    "the difference between the redshift distribution of a low - density flat universe model and of a low - density open universe model is less dramatic , and one needs a relatively large number of clusters at high redshift to falsify them .",
    "the sze cluster surveys are suitable for this purpose .",
    "by fully using the redshift distribution and the total number of sze clusters , haiman , mohr , & holder ( 2000 ) studied constraints on the quintessence theory from future sze ( and x - ray ) cluster surveys .",
    "the redshift of a cluster with @xmath31 can be obtained at least by using the photometric method around a characteristic spectral break . for clusters with @xmath32",
    ", it however appears difficult to measure the redshifts precisely except for very large clusters . in this paper , we propose a method which can distinguish , within the parameter regime @xmath9 and @xmath33 , a flat universe with a non - zero cosmological constant from an open universe even without knowing the full redshift distribution of sze clusters .",
    "we divide clusters into two groups : a low redshift one with @xmath0 , and a high redshift one with @xmath1 .",
    "we study the ratio @xmath34 for different cosmologies with different parameters , where @xmath3 is the total flux - limited number of clusters with @xmath0 , and @xmath5 is the total flux - limited number of clusters with @xmath1 .",
    "it is found that @xmath7 can be used to disentangle a low - density flat universe from a low - density open universe .",
    "notice that to compute @xmath7 , we only need to know the redshift range of a cluster ( whether it is @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) rather than its precise redshift .",
    "we also investigate , within the framework of the flat universes with a non - zero cosmological constant , the sze cluster - normalized @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath35 relation inferred from the sze cluster counts is distinctly different from that from the x - ray cluster counts with the latter more steeper .",
    "this difference can be used to limit the parameter regime of @xmath11 and @xmath13 simultaneously .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 will present the formulation for the study .",
    "the results will be shown in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a summary .",
    "as cmb photons pass through a sea of hot electrons , their blackbody spectrum is distorted by the inverse compton scattering . the sz effect",
    "can be characterized by the compton @xmath36 parameter , @xmath37 where @xmath22 is the number density of hot electrons , @xmath38 is the thomson cross section , @xmath39 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath23 is the temperature of the hot intracluster gas , @xmath40 is the electron mass , and @xmath41 is the speed of light .",
    "the integration is along the line - of - sight , and @xmath36 parameter is proportional to the integrated thermal pressure along the line - of - sight .",
    "when the electron temperature @xmath23 is much higher than the temperature @xmath42 of the cmb photons , the cmb flux change due to the presence of a cluster can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the frequency of the cmb photons , @xmath46 is the planck s constant , the unperturbed cmb flux @xmath47 , @xmath48 , \\eqno ( 3)\\ ] ] and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angular diameter distance of the cluster , and the integration is over the projected area of the cluster .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath51 , @xmath52 . at the lower and higher frequency parts , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . for amiba , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that the intracluster gas is isothermal and the gas mass fraction @xmath58 is a constant",
    ". then we have ( e.g. , eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the proton mass , @xmath61 is the hydrogen mass fraction , and @xmath62 is the total mass ( including the dark matter ) of the cluster .",
    "here we have used that the intracluster gas mass is dominated by hydrogen and helium .",
    "further the gas is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential of the total mass of the cluster , then @xmath63_{r_{vir } } } \\mu m_p { gm\\over r_{vir } } , \\eqno ( 6)\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the radial density profile of the gas , @xmath65 stands for the virial radius of the cluster , and @xmath66 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "we have used , in equation ( 6 ) , the virial mass to represent the total mass of the cluster .",
    "let @xmath67 be the average mass density with respect to the critical density at redshift @xmath68 of the cluster formation , then    @xmath69_{r_{vir } } } \\bigg ( { 6.8 \\over 5 x+3 } \\bigg ) \\bigg ( { m\\over 10^{15 } h^{-1 } m_{\\odot}}\\bigg ) ^{2/3 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\times ( 1+z ) \\bigg [ { \\omega_0\\over \\omega ( z)}\\bigg ] ^{1/3 } \\bigg ( { \\delta_c \\over 178}\\bigg ) ^{1/3 } \\hbox { kev } ,   \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad ( 7 ) \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 is the density parameter at redshift @xmath68 , and @xmath15 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath71 .",

    "we will use the value @xmath74_{r_{vir}}=2 $ ] , which is consistent with both the observational and the numerical simulation results .",
    "in fact , the results for different values of @xmath75_{r_{vir}}$ ] can be obtained from our analyses by rescaling the overall flux @xmath76 up or down , as can be seen from equation ( 8) .",
    "the cosmology enters the relation ( 8) between @xmath76 and @xmath62 through the angular diameter distance @xmath50 , the density parameters @xmath11 and @xmath70 , and the over density parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we will calculate the flux - limited sze cluster counts .",
    "note by using equation ( 8) to calculate @xmath77 from a given flux limit @xmath4 , we have implicitly assumed that the counts are for unresolved clusters .",
    "an array of interferometers must , however , have a minimum baseline which is essentially limited by the dish diameter @xmath78 . signals from angular scales larger than about @xmath79 are lost where @xmath80 is the observing wavelength . for amiba",
    "there are two sets of dishes with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for @xmath81 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 . for the smaller set of dishes",
    ", there should not be of any loss of signals from clusters .",
    "we have estimated the mass limit for @xmath88 by simply cutting off any signals from @xmath89 .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium gas density profile has been used by assuming that the underlying dark matter distribution has a universal density profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "the mass limit estimated here is not very different from that for the unresolved clusters at @xmath90 of the amiba design .",
    "thus our studies presented in the next section will only consider the unresolved cluster counts .",
    "holder et al . ( 1999 ) determined @xmath77 by performing mock observations appropriate for a proposed interferometric array which consists of ten @xmath91 telescopes operating on @xmath92 ( mohr et al .",
    "1999 ) on simulated clusters ; the shape of the @xmath93 is similar to that for unresolved clusters . in the work of haiman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the mass limit for their fiducial model is from holder et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and @xmath77 for other cosmological models is obtained by using the same scaling relation as that of equation ( 8) .",
    "they found that the mass limit from the scaling relation agrees with the mock survey results better than @xmath94 for the two testing cosmological models .",
    "we use the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) to calculate the number of sze clusters .",
    "the comoving number density of clusters of mass @xmath62 with width @xmath95 is , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the present mass density of the universe , @xmath98 the linear overdensity threshold for collapse at redshift @xmath68 , and @xmath99 the r.m.s .",
    "linear density fluctuation on the scale corresponding to @xmath62 .",
    "notice that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are computed from the extrapolated - to - present linear density perturbations .",

    "the normalization factor @xmath13 is determined from the x - ray cluster counts ( eke et al .",
    "it is clearly seen that the redshift distribution of @xmath28 models is drastically different from that of low-@xmath124 models . because of the continuing growth of the linear density perturbation for the @xmath28 models , their cluster numbers at high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) are very tiny when the perturbations are normalized to the local cluster abundance .",
    "the presence of a few clusters at @xmath1 would strongly falsify the @xmath28 models .",
    "in fact , the existence of high redshift optical or x - ray clusters has been used to constrain the range of @xmath11 ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the differences of the redshift distribution between the two low - density cosmological models are not as impressive as the differences between them and the @xmath28 models , but are still rather substantial at high redshifts .",
    "the number of sze clusters drops rapidly for the @xmath121cmd model , while for the low - density open model its redshift distribution has a long tail at high redshifts .",
    "the different behaviors of the two models are mainly caused by the different angular diameter distances @xmath50 [ see equation ( 8) ] .    in the following",
    "we will study the ratio of the low and high redshift sze clusters for the two types of low - density cosmologies .",
    "specifically , the ratio of @xmath34 is considered .",
    "the relative number of high and low - redshift clusters with their masses above a given threshold has been used in determining separately @xmath11 and @xmath13 by fan , bahcall and cen ( 1997 ) .",
    "their study is different from ours in several aspects , but both analyses take the advantage of the dependence of the cluster evolution on cosmologies .    the model with @xmath117 , @xmath122 , @xmath114 and @xmath123 is chosen to be the fiducial one .",
    "the particular @xmath13 value is from the observed x - ray cluster counts . for other models ,",
    "the cosmological density parameter is taken to be @xmath9 .",
    "we vary @xmath12 in the range of @xmath10 , consistent with large - scale structure studies ( peacock & dodds 1994 , dodelson & gaztanaga 2000 ) .",
    "we determine @xmath13 of a specific model in such a way that it gives rise to about the same total number of flux - limited sze clusters as that of the fiducial one at @xmath125 . we will refer to this as sze - cluster - normalized @xmath13 . for the moment we pretend not to know the x - ray or the optical cluster normalization ( except for the @xmath13 of the fiducial model ) , and only the sze cluster counts",
    "are used in determining both @xmath13 and @xmath7 .",
    "in fact the derived @xmath13 from sze cluster counts is consistent with that from x - ray or optical cluster counts for the parameter range we are considering .",
    "but later we will see that if we require the same total number of sze clusters for two models with significantly different values of @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath126 versus @xmath127 ) , at least one of the two @xmath13 will have to be out of the current x - ray cluster constraint .",
    "this inconsistency can be used in turn to falsify different models .",
    "in fig.2 we show @xmath7 versus @xmath4 for the fiducial cosmology ( solid line ) , and for low - density open cosmologies . to avoid crowding , for open cosmologies only the highest and the lowest @xmath7 ( dotted lines ) for @xmath128 and @xmath33 and",
    "the results for @xmath117 with @xmath129 ( dashed lines ) are plotted .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath7 range for the open universes is quite separated from that of the fiducial model . at @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 for the low - density flat fiducial model . for a sze cluster survey which covers @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "consider the poisson noise , then @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the standard deviation of @xmath7 .",
    "thus the largest @xmath7 for the set of open universes is about @xmath138 away from the fiducial @xmath7 .",
    "the open model with @xmath117 and @xmath114 is about @xmath139 away .",
    "this demonstrates that if the @xmath7 value and the total number of sze clusters from observations are indeed around the values of the fiducial model , low - density open models can be excluded at the @xmath140 level depending on how well the @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameters have been determined . with larger surveys",
    ", the exclusion can be made with higher statistical significance .",
    "we emphasize that different models are sze cluster normalized , and thus the above conclusion is independent of the ` real ' normalization ( where ` real ' normalization means the conventional normalization from x - ray / optical cluster observations ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the total number of sze clusters is sensitive to the normalization factor , the combined analysis on x - ray cluster counts and on sze cluster counts could falsify cosmological models if the normalizations determined separately from the x - ray clusters and from the sze clusters disagree .",
    "this point will be elaborated in the next subsection .",
    "attentive readers may have suspected that if one decreases @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a flat model , its @xmath7 range can get closer to those of open models . in fig.3",
    ", we show the result for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 ( model 1 , solid line ) along with some of the results for open models : @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( model 2 , dotted line ) ; @xmath141 and @xmath146 ( model 3 , upper dashed line ) ; @xmath147 and @xmath114 ( model 4 , middle dashed line ) ; @xmath141 and @xmath143 ( model 5 , lower dashed line ) .",
    "all other open models with @xmath128 and @xmath33 have the @xmath7 value in between the results of model 2 and 5 .",
    "the open models have been normalized so that they contain about the same total number of sze clusters as that of model 1 at @xmath130 . at this @xmath4 , model 1",
    "has @xmath148 and model 2 has @xmath149 . for model 1 @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath7 for a @xmath152 survey is then @xmath153 .",
    "thus model 2 differs from model 1 at about @xmath154 level .",
    "this difference itself may not be large enough to distinguish the two models .",
    "we however notice that the two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the two models lie toward the opposite limit of our considered range : @xmath141 and @xmath143 for model 1 , and @xmath145 and @xmath146 for model 2 .",
    "hence if @xmath11 or @xmath12 can be constrained to better degrees by other observations , the low - density flat model and open models can be distinguished at a higher level of significance ( for example , the sloan digital sky survey would give a better constraint on the @xmath12 parameter ) .",
    "this can be seen from the @xmath7 differences at @xmath130 which are at @xmath155 and @xmath156 levels between model 1 and model 3 , and between model 1 and model 4 , respectively .",
    "most drastically model 1 and model 5 have the same @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the difference in @xmath7 increases to the @xmath139 level .",
    "we show in fig.4 the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath7 for @xmath117 and @xmath122 .",
    "the three curves are for @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "all the models are normalized to contain about the same sze clusters as our fiducial model at @xmath130 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath7 is not very sensitive to @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath12 can not be strongly constrained by the sze cluster counts alone .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the three models are all normalized to @xmath123 , the trend in @xmath7 is reversed from that shown in fig.4 , i.e. , @xmath7 with @xmath143 is the largest , and @xmath7 for @xmath146 is the smallest .",
    "but the curves occupy the same region as that in fig.4 .    to see the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath7 , we plot @xmath7 in fig.5 for low - density flat models with @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 parameter is taken to be @xmath161 for all the three models , and as before , they are normalized according to the total number of sze clusters of the fiducial model at @xmath162 . with such normalizations , @xmath7 is not sensitive to @xmath11 either .",
    "we conclude that @xmath7 is a very useful quantity to differentiate the low - density flat cosmological models from the low - density open cosmological models . within the likely parameter regime of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is not sensitive to either of them if different models are normalized consistently to the sze cluster counts .",
    "this method is independent of the means by using the cmb measurement , and thus provides an important test on our understanding of the universe and of the formation of the large - scale structure .",
    "our conclusion above is not sensitive to the specific total number density of sze clusters used to normalize different models .",
    "for instance , if we increase the total sze cluster number density from @xmath163 to @xmath164 ( the corresponding change of @xmath13 of the fiducial model is from @xmath165 to @xmath166 ) , the @xmath121cdm model with @xmath117 and @xmath114 and the open model with the same @xmath11 and @xmath12 can also be distinguished at about @xmath139 level for a @xmath152 survey . the operational steps to apply our method to observations are ( 1 ) to normalize different models to the observed total sze cluster counts ; ( 2 ) to calculate the @xmath7 value for different models ; ( 3 ) to find the @xmath7 value from observations ; ( 4 ) to compare ( 3 ) with ( 2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the relatively large separation of the @xmath7 value between the @xmath121cdm and the open cdm models shown above is restricted to our considered parameter intervals of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "if the @xmath11 range is increased to @xmath167 , there will have some overlaps in @xmath7 for the two types of models .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 value of the @xmath121cdm model with @xmath126 falls into about the same range as that of the open cdm model with @xmath127 .",
    "thus solely with the sze total counts and the @xmath7 value , the two models can not be differentiated clearly .",
    "however , one would find that in order to have the same total number of sze clusters , at least one of the two @xmath13 must be out of the range allowed by the observed x - ray cluster counts .",
    "therefore an exclusion is possible based on both the sze cluster observations and the x - ray observations .",
    "stated somewhat differently , in order to make a relatively clean distinction between the @xmath121cdm and the open cdm models by using @xmath7 alone , the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 must be pre - determined by other observations to a relatively fine degree .",
    "in conjunction with x - ray or optical cluster observations , the sze cluster counts can be used to distinguish the two types of models for wider parameter regimes .",
    "results from the recent boomerang cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation observation show the first doppler peak at @xmath168 beautifully ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) , and make the flat universe be widely accepted ( hu 2000 , tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ) . if we indeed live in a flat universe with a non - zero cosmological constant , then , as we will describe below , the combined analyses of x - ray cluster counts and sze cluster counts can give rise to constraints on @xmath11 and on @xmath13 even without the cluster redshift information .",
    "the key here is that the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath11 inferred from x - ray cluster counts is different from that from sze cluster counts .",
    "the x - ray cluster counts yielded the relation @xmath169 for @xmath170 ( eke et al .",
    "1996 ) . here",
    "we study the expected @xmath35 correlation from sze cluster counts .    the formulation presented in sec .",
    "2 are used to study the sze @xmath35 relation . or",
    "more clearly , the following assumptions are employed : ( 1 ) .",
    "the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential well of the total cluster mass ; ( 2 ) .",
    "the gas is isothermal and the gas mass fraction is a constant among different clusters ; ( 3 ) .",
    "the collapse is approximately spherical ; ( 4 ) .",
    "the press - schechter formula is approximately correct in predicting the number of clusters .",
    "we would like to point out that same approximations have been used in deriving the @xmath35 correlation from x - ray cluster observations ( eke et al .",
    "1996 )    the model with @xmath117 , @xmath122 , @xmath114 , and @xmath171 is taken to be the fiducial one .",
    "we first compute the total surface number density of sze clusters at @xmath172 for the fiducial model , and then find @xmath13 values for other @xmath121cdm models with different @xmath11 so that they have the same total surface number density of sze clusters at @xmath172 as the fiducial model .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the relation can be nearly perfectly described by @xmath173 ( the solid line in fig .",

    "the dependence of the sze cluster - normalized @xmath13 on @xmath11 is much weaker than that of the x - ray cluster - normalized @xmath13 , which can be understood from eqns ( 7 ) and ( 8) . the x - ray cluster - normalized @xmath13 is calculated from temperature - limited cluster counts ( eke et al .",
    "the cluster mass limit @xmath77 dervied from a given cluster gas temperature threshold is proportional to @xmath176^{-1/2}\\delta_c^{-1/2}$ ] [ eqn .",

    "since the cluster number counts from the press - schechter formalism is sensitive to the mass limit , the inferred @xmath13 by comparing results from x - ray observations with the predictions of the press - schechter calculations depends on @xmath11 differently from that from sze cluster ` observations ' .",

    "the fiducial @xmath11 can be determined to @xmath184 or @xmath185 . from fig .",
    "7 , it can be seen that the x - ray cluster - normalization constrains more tightly the value of @xmath11 as it is much more sensitive to @xmath11 . with future x - ray cluster surveys such as xmm",
    ", the normalization can be determined to a much better degree . at a @xmath186 precision on @xmath13 from x - ray surveys",
    ", @xmath11 can be constrained to @xmath187 ( @xmath188 precision ) with the allowance of a @xmath139 deviation of sze cluster counts . in comparison with the results of haiman",
    "et al . ( 2000 , fig.7 in their paper ) for the @xmath189 case , their constraint on @xmath11 is more stringent .",
    "but in their analyses , they normalize all models to give rise to the local cluster number density with @xmath190 , i.e. , for each model , the normalization is fixed .",
    "they then compare both the total number of sze clusters and the redshift distribution of a model with those of their fiducial one to constrain the parameter regimes .",
    "note that for the @xmath189 case , the total number of sze clusters plays the dominant role in constraining @xmath11 .",
    "if we focus on the single middle dashed line in our fig .",
    "7 , the @xmath139 determination of @xmath11 from the sze total number counts is similar to that of haiman et al .",
    "be aware however the different cosmological parameters , the normalizations and the survey parameters used in their analyses and in our studies .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath13 can also be constrained at the same time . in contrary to the determination of @xmath11 , the @xmath13 value is constrained more tightly by the sze cluster counts . at @xmath117 ,",

    ", is equivalent to change the overall flux limit @xmath4 . from the figures we showed ,",
    "it is easy to see that all our conclusions remain qualitatively unchanged for different choices of these parameters .",

    "the flat model with @xmath117 and @xmath114 and the open model with the same @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be differentiated at the @xmath139 level for a @xmath133 survey .",
    "since we normalize different models in a way such that they give rise to the same total number of sze clusters , our analyses naturally take into account the total number of sze clusters . for wider parameter ranges ,",
    "the information from other observations , such as x - ray or optical cluster surveys has to be used to differentiate the two types of models .",
    "there are other ways to determine the geometry of the universe .",
    "measurements on fluctuations of the cmb radiation provide a clean test on this aspect ( e.g. , hu 2000 ) .",
    "the horizon size of the universe at decoupling separates large - scale and small - scale cmb fluctuations .",
    "large - scale fluctuations were outside the horizon when photons escaped while small - scale perturbations were within the horizon at decoupling and therefore sustained acoustic oscillations .",
    "the position of the primary doppler peak of the cmb fluctuation power spectrum is determined by the angular size of the horizon at decoupling . for a flat universe ( low - density with a non - zero cosmological constant or high density ) ,",
    "the peak located at @xmath168 , and the peak is shifted to smaller angular scale or higher @xmath197 for a low - density open universe , where @xmath197 represents the two - dimensional angular wavenumber .",
    "observations have seen the rising and the declining of cmb fluctuations around @xmath198 ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "1999 , de bernardis et al . 2000 ) , which constrains convincingly that @xmath199 is close to @xmath200 , where @xmath199 is the total density parameter . combining with other information , e.g. , supernova measurements ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 , schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) , leads to the conclusion that we are living in a low - density flat universe .",
    "if the results from sze cluster surveys are in agreement with the cmb results , we will be in a more solid position to say that the universe is flat and the simple structure formation theory we adopted here is reasonably correct . on the other hand , any inconsistency between the sze cluster results and the results from cmb measurements would pose challenges to our understanding of the universe .",
    "for example , alternate structure formation theories , such as non - gaussian initial fluctuation models , may need to be considered .",
    "should the universe be flat , sze cluster surveys can also provide constraints on cosmological parameters .",
