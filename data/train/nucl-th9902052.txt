    "the effective field theory ( eft ) of nuclear forces based on a chiral expansion of an effective lagrangian , as proposed by weinberg @xcite , gives a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in leading order which is the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) plus a dirac - delta .",
    "he suggested to infer the values of the strength of the delta force in the @xmath1 and @xmath4 channels from the singlet and triplet scattering lengths respectively .",
    "also such potential should be valid for momenta well below a typical momentum scale of quantum chromodynamics such as the rho meson mass ( @xmath5 4 @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the intermediate virtual propagation of the nn system should be cut at the momentum scale of this order .    in spite of the significative results obtained by several authors , when implementing the eft program for the two nucleon system  @xcite , and also by a recent related approach  @xcite , as far as we know the predictibility power of the leading order term ( opep plus delta ) with a single renormalization momentum scale was not fully explored in the literature .",
    "the result of such calculation would give a sound basis for the renormalization program of eft in nn system .",
    "the leading order term was already considered in nn calculations , when comparing with more realistic calculations  @xcite , or as part of interactions used in the eft program  @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that , without a systematic analysis of the physical contribution coming from each order term in the renormalization procedure , it is easy to miss their real significance when parametrizing the full interaction to obtain the desired observables .   to start , it is relevant to know how much physical information can one extract from the leading order term , using a renormalization procedure .",
    "what are the observables one can better describe with just the leading order term ( the higher order terms should not affect too much these observables ) and what are the observables for which higher order terms are essential ?",
    "our aim in this paper is to answer such questions .",
    "we hope the following analysis can be useful in the renormalization program of the effective field theory applied to the nucleon - nucleon system .    in this work",
    "we have verified strictly the validity of weinberg suggestion , to first consider ( in leading order ) an effective potential which  consists of just a conventional one - pion exchange term , plus a direct neutron - proton ( @xmath7 ) interaction produced by the four - fermion terms \"  @xcite .",
    "such  four - fermion terms \" consist of two delta - function interactions : one in the @xmath1 channel and the other in the @xmath4 channel .  to be consistent with the original suggestion , to cut the virtual propagation of the nn system at the scale @xmath8",
    ", we first use a renormalization scale of such order .",
    "however , we understand this as a qualitative suggestion , such that we explore its limitation in the calculation of several low - energy nn observables .",
    "so , we finally consider a free renormalization scale in our numerical calculation , and try to obtain a consistent description , in order that such scale vanishes as a physical parameter as required by a renormalization group invariant theory .    in our approach",
    ", we use a renormalization scheme for the t - matrix , which is appropriate when considering the opep plus a delta potential .",
    "it incorporates the momentum scale @xmath9 where the two - nucleon propagation is removed and the scattering lenghts fix the renormalized strengths .",
    "a subtracted t - matrix integral equation is derived , where the subtraction is done at energy of @xmath10 , in the center of mass system ( in units of @xmath11 and nucleon mass @xmath12 ) .",
    "the input is the t - matrix at energy @xmath10 , which is chosen as the opep supplemented by delta interactions .",
    "the scale @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath8 , and we will show that the results for the renormalized t - matrix , in the limit of @xmath13 , once the scattering lengths are kept fixed , are quite consistent with @xmath14 , at least for the diagonal components of the matrix ( the extension of this statement will be clarified ) .",
    "as we verified , the numerical results in the @xmath2 channels , obtained by following this procedure are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data for the @xmath7 phase - shifts , mixing parameter , the deuteron binding energy and d / s ratio , at laboratory energies below @xmath15 50 mev .",
    "the higher order terms in the eft expansion of the effective interaction will become more important for laboratory energies above 50 mev in the @xmath2 channels , where the leading order results clearly deviate from the data .",
    "however , in the @xmath1 state the importance of the higher order terms appears already in the value of the effective range , which is underestimated in lowest order .",
    "such results confirm that the effective interaction in the singlet state needs higher order correction ( as already expected ) , but such corrections should not affect in an essential way the triplet states ( particularly at low energies ) , which are already in a fair agreement with data .     in our scheme , it is considered an unregulated effective power expansion of the nn potential only in the mid- and short- range parts of the interaction , such that the well stablished long - range part ( opep ) is kept intact  .",
    "so , the matrix elements of the full effective nn interaction , in the relative momentum space , will be given by @xmath16 , \\label{veft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unregulated strengths of the contact interaction , and the higher order derivatives , have subindices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for the isospin singlet ( spin triplet ) and isospin triplet ( spin singlet ) channels respectively .",
    "the matrix element of the one - pion - exchange potential is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the usual spin and isosping pauli matrices for nucleon @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the axial coupling constant , @xmath24 mev ) is the pion weak - decay constant , and @xmath25 mev ) is the pion mass .",

    "in section ii we present the formalism for the subtracted t - matrix , which is applied to the leading order term of the nn interaction . in section",
    "iii we present our main results and conclusions .",
    "in the next we introduce our formalism which is based on a subtracted equation for the t - matrix .",
    "we begin with the formal t - matrix equation ( for a regular potential ) , which is written as : @xmath29^{-1}v \\label{tren1 } \\\\ & = v+t(e)g^{(+)}_0(e)v & = v[1-g^{(+)}_0(e)v]^{-1 } \\ , \\label{tren2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the free green s function for the two - body system , with the appropriate boundary condition , in terms of the free hamiltonian @xmath30 , is @xmath31    considering that our input is given by the t - matrix at a given scale , the potential will formally be replaced by the t - matrix at scale @xmath0 through eq.([tren1 ] ) or eq.([tren2 ] ) : @xmath32^{-1 } = \\left[{1+t(-\\mu^2 ) g_0(-\\mu^2)}\\right]^{-1}t(-\\mu^2 ) \\ .",
    "\\label{vren}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the potential given by eq.([vren ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ tren1 ] ) and ( [ tren2 ] ) , the corresponding subtracted equation for the t - matrix is found : @xmath33 one should note that we have chosen a real value for @xmath0 ( negative energy ) , but this is not a restriction to the generality of the subtracted t - matrix equation ( [ tren3 ] )",
    ". however , such choice has the advantage that the kernel of the integral equation has just one fixed point singularity for positive energies @xmath34 , and the same formal structure as the original t - matrix equation .",
    "as one can see , from the original t - matrix , one simply needs to replace @xmath35 by @xmath36 and multiply the free propagator by a function which depends on the scale @xmath0 , such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 the renormalized t - matrix equation , given above , has a kernel which is subtracted at the energy point @xmath10 .",
    "although the interaction @xmath35 , as given by eq . ( [ vren ] ) , is not defined for a singular interaction , the subtracted t - matrix equation is well defined for a regular interaction plus a delta potential .",
    "this justifies _ a posteriori _ the formal manipulations in obtaing eq.([tren3 ] ) .",
    "one could instead , work with a finite cut - off in the momentum integrations and derive the subtracted equation for the t - matrix ; then take the infinite limit of the cut - off .",
    "of course the subtracted equation for the t - matrix is insensible to the cut - off as long the potential is singular like a delta interaction .    in the second term of the right - hand side of eq.([tren3 ] ) , the propagation over the intermediate states is subtracted at an energy scale of @xmath10 .",
    "the physical information apparently lost in this subtraction is contained in @xmath36 , which in the case of pure contact interaction is the renormalized coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "if one sets @xmath36 equal to a given operator ( @xmath0 independent ) , the scheme becomes dependent on the subtraction point , which only has @xmath0 vanishing as a physical parameter ( i.e. , the theory is renormalization group invariant ) in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "this is a trivial observation when such operator is a regular potential .",
    "thus , setting the potential as equal to the t - matrix at @xmath40 , the present scheme implies , that the physical t - matrix is found in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "we will show that the procedure can be applied for a singular potential like opep plus contact term , and the limit @xmath39 gives finite physical observables with vanishing dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical results obtained by constraining @xmath36 to be equal to opep plus contact term for several values of @xmath0 show quantitatively the limiting process , while the scattering lengths are kept fixed . in this way",
    ", one can also verify how good is a scale as low as the @xmath41-meson mass , in order to approach the limiting values for the observables .",
    "anticipating our numerical findings , the low - energy phase - shifts for the @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath42 channels give a reasonable support to such low value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , this is not true for the @xmath43 mixing - parameter , even for energies as low as 20 mev .",
    "let us apply the subtracted t - matrix equation for the pure contact interaction , and re - obtain some well - known results just for the sake of completeness . in this case",
    ", the matrix elements of the t - matrix are independent of the momentum and , at @xmath40 , it is given by the renormalized coupling constant : @xmath44 the renormalized t - matrix in the subtraction point is given by @xmath45 , which is the physical information supplied by the two - body system in order to obtain other observables .",
    "for example , @xmath46 is identified with the scattering length ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 . solving eq.([tren3 ] ) , in the usual three - dimensional space with condition ( [ lambda1 ] ) , @xmath49^{-1 } \\ . \\label{tregd5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the on - shell - momentum is @xmath50 and @xmath51^{-1 } \\ . \\label{tregd6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general the matrix elements of a two - body interaction will depend on the momentum , spin and isospin , such that it will be usefull to define our notation for the partial wave decomposition .",

    "@xmath59 are the usual orthonormalized functions for the coupled angular ( @xmath56 ) and spin ( @xmath57 ) momentum to the total momentum ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "the results in the @xmath1 channel could be improved by adding higher - order terms in the effective interaction , as already one can deduce from previous approaches used by other authors in eft  @xcite .",

    ". 1 are pratically insensible to nucleon - nucleon propagation for momenta higher than 4 @xmath6 , in agreement with results shown for the singlet effective range ( table i ) , such that no improvement can be expected for the singlet observables with just one subtraction / parameter .  in fig .",

    "( [ mixing ] ) .",
    "the results are insentive to @xmath115 only for @xmath117 10 mev , and show a fair reproduction of the nijmegen values .",
    "this follows due to the dominance of opep in the slope of @xmath43 at zero energy@xcite .  above 10 mev",
    ", the mixing parameter shows a dependence on the values of @xmath0 , which is reduced by increasing @xmath0 above 30@xmath118 , while the agreement with data is improved as @xmath3 .",

    "our results in the limit of @xmath39 are consistent with the ones obtained by ballot and robillota @xcite , where they have used a cut - off parameter .    the results presented in table i and figs",
    ". 1 - 4 , when compared with fitted data  @xcite and with other calculations with more fitting parameters @xcite , are a clear evidence of the dominance of the leading order term ( opep ) in low - energy nn observables .",
    "this implies that one should first renormalize the t - matrix for the leading order term and then add higher order terms to the nn interaction in the chiral expansion , or in the eft expansion .",
    "our results for the phase - shifts and mixing parameter show that the mixing parameter is the most sensitive observable to the subtraction point used in the renormalization procedure .",
    "the phase - shifts for @xmath1 state and for the @xmath42 are pratically insensitive to @xmath0 larger than 4 @xmath6 , with an evidence that @xmath42 is dominated by the opep , in agreement with previous calculations@xcite .",
    "the present results confirm that the addition of higher order singular terms in the potential are needed in order to fit the singlet effective range and corresponding phase - shifts .",
    "this observation was already verified in several eft approaches  @xcite , without however addressing to the full predictibility of the leading order term .",
    "this lead some authors to affect negatively the nice fitting obtained for the triplet channel when trying to improve the observables for the singlet channel  @xcite . in order to avoid this problem",
    ", it is important to parametrize the higher order corrections , such that it affects mostly the singlet channel ( where the leading order fails to give a good description also to the effective range , independently of the renormalization point ) . in the @xmath2 channels",
    ", the higher order terms will become more important for laboratory energies above 50 mev , where the leading order results deviate from the data ( as shown in figs . 2 and 4 ) .",
    "considering the results obtained and shown in figs . 1 - 4 , we would like to make some comments about the renormalization scale @xmath0 , which appears in our approach as the point where we introduce a subtraction in the nucleon - nucleon propagator .",
    "( this parameter is directly related to the  cut - off \" parameter of other approaches . )",
    "weinberg  @xcite has originally suggested to cut the virtual propagation of the nn system at the scale @xmath8 , which implies @xmath120 4 @xmath6 , and this suggestion is consistent with our results , as it is almost exactly verified for the @xmath1 and @xmath42 phase shifts ( see figs . 1 and 3 ) , and also approximately for the @xmath4 phase shifts ( fig .",
    "we further observe that our results for @xmath3 ( numerically , we have used @xmath121 60 @xmath6 ) are about the same we got for the @xmath1 and @xmath42 , and improves the results we obtain for the @xmath4 case , for the mixing parameter , and also related observables , as shown in table i. such results , particularly the results for the mixing parameter , lead us to conclude that weinberg s suggestion can only be understood as a qualitative statement , and as such , it is verified .",
    "however , we observe that the mixing parameter , which is very sensible to this renormalization scale , is violating this statement even for @xmath122 20 mev .",
    "this result implies that some essential physical information for such observable is being lost when using @xmath14 , and as we observe for other observables , there is no danger in increasing the value of @xmath0 .",
    "another important observation , related to a statement of caution made in ref.@xcite , is that we are not _ unnecessarily complicating the theory _ , or _ introducing irrelevant degrees of freedom _ when considering @xmath3 , as it is possible to occur in other eft approaches .",
    "our conclusion for a practical calculation with the leading order term is that one should use a momentum renormalization parameter of the order of @xmath123 @xmath6 ( as suggested in @xcite ) to obtain qualitative results for the low energy nn observables .",
    "but , to improve the results for some observables , like the triplet mixing parameter shown in fig . 4 and also the @xmath4 phase shifts , there is no danger in extending @xmath3 , as the previous results are not affected by increasing such value for the scale .    in conclusion , we have examined the complete renormalization of the leading order term of the neutron - proton interaction .",
    "we suggest the use of a t - matrix with a subtracted propagator , at an energy @xmath10 , and we have concluded about an overall insensitivity of the low - energy singlet and triplet phase - shifts for momentum scale @xmath0 larger than 4 @xmath6 .",
    "such result supports the qualitative suggestion presented in ref .",
    "however , the results for the mixing parameter ( see fig . 4 ) show that this observable is more sensible to the renormalization scale , and therefore more appropriate than the diagonal phase - shift results to be described by an eft .",
    "our results for this observable show that @xmath3 is necessary to have a better agreement with data . and",
    "notice that a larger value of @xmath0 is also consistent with the previous results obtained for the phase - shifts .",
    "we can conclude that , in our renormalization scheme , @xmath0 vanishes as a physical parameter , and the theory is renormalization group invariant in the limit @xmath39  . ] .",
    "it has been achieved with this work that the renormalized t - matrix for the leading order interaction has a well defined limit for the physical observables for @xmath124 with the constraint that @xmath36 being equal to opep plus contact interaction , which also is supported by the data in the triplet channel .",
    "the following step to be investigated is the inclusion of the next order term in the eft expansion of the nn interaction , i.e. , the laplacian of the delta potential . in this case ,",
