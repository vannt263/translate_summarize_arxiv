    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , one of the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe , are galaxies with a strong and variable non - thermal emission , believed to be the result of accretion of mass onto a supermassive black hole ( with a mass ranging from @xmath310@xmath4 to @xmath310@xmath5 m@xmath6 ) lying at the center of the galaxy . in some cases ( @xmath710% )",
    "agns show powerful and highly collimated relativistic jets shooting out in opposite directions , perpendicular to the accretion disc .",
    "the jets emanate from the vicinity of the black hole ( @xmath30.1 pc ) and extend up to @xmath3 1 mpc .",
    "they are usually associated to several bright superluminal knots , which appear related to the episodic ejection of plasmoid blobs ( see for example the case of the active galaxy m87 @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the agn jets is one of the open problems in astrophysics .",
    "agns viewed at a small angle to the axis of the jet are called blazars .",
    "they usually show flat radio spectra , strong variability , optical polarization and @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "blazars include bl lac objects , which have a lower luminosity and lack of strong emission lines in the optical band , and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , which show a higher luminosity with strong and broad emission lines .",
    "the strongly doppler - boosted radiation makes blazars the most extreme class of agns , where the boosted emission overwhelms all other emissions from the source .",
    "therefore , the observation of blazars allows a deep insight into the physical conditions and emission processes of relativistic jets .",
    "blazars are the dominant extragalactic source class in @xmath0-rays , as revealed by the @xmath1 large area telescope ( lat ) survey at gev energies @xcite . moving to very high energies ( vhe , @xmath80.1 tev ) ,",
    "the bl lac objects dominate the extragalactic sky . up to now",
    ", 60 agns have been established as vhe @xmath0-ray emitters , including 52 bl lac objects .",
    "although the @xmath0-ray emission from blazars has been studied for about two decades , it is still unclear where and how the emission originates . observations of the misaligned radio galaxy m87 indicate that vhe @xmath0-rays , at least during flaring periods , seem to originate within the jet collimation region , in the immediate vicinity of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the high energy particles responsible for the nonthermal emission are generally believed to be accelerated in the relativistic shock front , described by the theory of diffusive acceleration ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation of a blazar is a broadband continuum ranging from radio through x - rays to @xmath0-rays .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by two distinct bumps , which are believed to be dominated by non - thermal emission",
    ". the lower energy component , which peaks in the optical through x - ray , is caused by the synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) within the jet .",
    "the origin of the high energy @xmath0-ray component is still debated .",
    "the general view attributes it to inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) or external photons ( external compton , ec ) by the same population of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "however , the hadronic scenario , which attributes the @xmath0-ray emission to proton - initiated cascades and/or to proton - synchrotron emission in a magnetic field - dominated jet @xcite , can not be excluded .    in this panorama ,",
    "multi - wavelength observations are of fundamental importance . according to the present measurements , x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays",
    "are correlated during the flaring periods ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a long - term continuous monitoring of mrk 421 performed by the astrophysical radiation with ground - based observatory at yangbajing ( argo - ybj ) experiment and different satellite - borne x - ray detectors @xcite showed a good correlation in terms of flux and spectral index .",
    "all the observational features indicate that @xmath0-rays and x - rays have a common origin , supporting the leptonic models .",
    "the tight correlation is a challenge for models based on hadronic processes . according to a recent collective evidence @xcite",
    ", the ssc mechanism seems to dominate the emission of bl lac objects , while the ec component becomes important for fsrq . the lack of strong emission lines in the radiation of bl lac objects is also taken as an evidence for a minor role of ambient photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) , favouring the ssc model . in this sense",
    "we can assume that bl lac objects are less affected by the circumambient background radiation and can be considered as ideal targets for the study of the physical processes within the jets .",
    "however , even in the framework of the ssc model , the fundamental question of the origin of the flux and spectral variability , observed on timescales from minutes to years , is still open .",
    "mrk 421 ( z=0.031 ) , classified as a bl lac object , is one of the brightest vhe @xmath0-ray blazars known .",
    "it is a very active blazar with major outbursts , composed of many short flares , about once every two years , in both x - rays and @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "actually it is considered an excellent candidate to study the physical processes within the agn jets . during the last decade ,",
    "several coordinated multi - wavelength campaigns focusing on mrk 421 were conducted , both in response to strong outbursts or as part of dedicated observation campaigns .",
    "complex relations between x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays spectra were observed in many flares ( see our previous review in @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the sparse multi - frequency data during long periods of time , no systematic studies on flux variation and sed evolution were achieved , especially in the @xmath0-ray band . in the beginning of 2009 , a multi - frequency observational campaign of mrk 421 was carried out for 4.5 months with an excellent temporal ( except at vhe ) and energy coverage from radio to vhe @xmath0-rays . during the whole campaign , however , mrk 421 showed a low activity at all wavebands @xcite .    to understand the emission variability and the underlying acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets , continuous multi - wavelength observations , particularly in x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays , are crucial .",
    "a simultaneous sed could provide a snapshot of the emitting population of particles and also constrain the model parameters at a given time @xcite .",
    "the shape of particle energy distribution could bring information on the underlying acceleration processes ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the vhe band",
    ", cherenkov telescopes can not regularly monitor agns , because of their limited duty cycle and narrow field of view ( fov ) .",
    "wide - fov extensive air showers ( eas ) arrays , with high duty cycles , are more suitable for this purpose .",
    "a review on eas arrays and their observations of agns can be found in @xcite .",
    "argo - ybj is an eas array with an energy threshold for primary @xmath0-rays of @xmath3300 gev . during 5 years argo - ybj continuously monitored the blazar mrk 421 , extending at higher energies the multi - wavelength survey carried out by the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) , the satellite - borne x - ray detectors @xmath9 , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ) and the gev @xmath0-ray detector @xmath1-lat . in particular",

    "the one - zone homogeneous ssc model proposed by @xcite is adopted to fit the multi - wavelength seds measured during different states . in this model a spherical blob of plasma with a co - moving radius @xmath90 is assumed .",
    "the relativistic doppler factor of the emitting plasma is defined as @xmath91^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath92 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma , @xmath93 is its bulk velocity in units of the speed of light , and @xmath94 is the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight , as measured in the observer frame . the emission volume is filled with an isotropic population of electrons and a randomly oriented uniform magnetic field @xmath95 .",
    "the sed of the injected electrons in the jet frame is assumed to follow a broken power law with indexes @xmath96 and @xmath97 below and above the break energy @xmath98 .",
    "the electron distribution is normalized by a factor @xmath99 ( in units of erg @xmath100 ) . to reduce the free parameters in the model , the low limit for the electron energy @xmath101 is fixed to be 500@xmath102 and the high limit @xmath103",
    "is assumed to be 10@xmath104 .",
    "the radius of the emission zone is constrained by the variability of the time scale as @xmath105 . in the multi - wavelength data considered in this analysis ,",
    "the fastest variability has a time scale of @xmath31 day , observed during f2 , in x - rays and gev @xmath0-rays , as shown in figure 4 . in this work ,",
    "the radius @xmath90 for all phases are arbitrarily set to be 10@xmath106 m , being @xmath107 hours the allowed time variability range .",
    "we have so far still six free parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , e@xmath108 , @xmath99 , b and @xmath109 to be determined experimentally by fitting the data presented in figure 7 .    in this work",
    ", we use the least - square method to determine the best values of the parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 , e@xmath110 , b , @xmath109 , and @xmath99 . for the @xmath9-xrt flux data",
    ", we added a 3% systematic error besides the statistical error listed in table 5 .",
    "the ultraviolet and radio data points were not used for the fit , as will be discussed later .",
    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) absorption of the vhe @xmath0-ray is included in the calculation , according to the @xcite model .",
    "since the parameter @xmath96 is related to the spectral shape at energies below the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks , it is mainly determined by @xmath9-xrt data in x - rays and by @xmath1-lat data in gev @xmath0-rays . for five out of ten states",
    "the @xmath9-xrt data around the synchrotron peak are not available , therefore in this cases @xmath96 is mainly determined by the @xmath1-lat data .",
    "the synchrotron peak energies of states s1 and s2 are close to the low energy limit of the @xmath9-xrt data , hence the measurement below the synchrotron peak can not strongly constrain the @xmath96 value , that also in this case will be mainly determined by the @xmath1-lat data . for the remaining three states ,",
    "the statistical accuracy of the @xmath9-xrt data is much better than that of other detectors , however the low energy @xmath9-xrt measurements ( at energies below @xmath31 kev ) are biased by the uncertainty in the absorption of hydrogen - equivalent column density and by detector systematics(such as the ccd charge trapping , generated by radiation and high - energy proton damage , affecting mostly the low energy events ) .",
    "for this reason we prefer to use for all the 10 states only @xmath0-ray data when fitting the parameter @xmath96 .",
    "the result and chi squares ( @xmath111/ndf ) obtained by the fitting procedure are listed in table 6 .",

    "the whole sed data above 0.3 kev are used . the @xmath9-xrt observation during f1",
    "is not taken into account .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 is determined by the spectral shape above the synchrotron and inverse compton peak energies .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath97 is mainly determined by the @xmath9-xrt , @xmath44-asm , @xmath43-gsc and @xmath9-bat data in x - rays , and by the argo - ybj data in tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath9-xrt measurements is much higher than that of other detectors , therefore @xmath97 can be well determined for states in which @xmath9-xrt data are available .",
    "the parameter @xmath109 is mainly determined by both the synchrotron and inverse compton peak energies .",
    "there are no data data around the synchrotron peak for f5 , f6 and f7 , therefore in these cases @xmath109 can not be well constrained .",
    "in particular , we can not find a best value for f7 within a reasonable range . for flare f7 , we arbitrarily set the value of @xmath98 equal to the one derived for the s2 state .    according to the fit results , the ssc model reasonably describes all the seds , as shown in figure 7 and 8 .",
    "the fact that @xmath9-xrt data below 0.5 kev are not perfectly described during ob , f2 and f3 , may be explained by the systematic errors previously discussed .",

    "using the long - term multi - wavelength data from radio to vhe @xmath0-rays , we have shown that mrk 421 is active at all wavebands during the 4.5 years considered in this work .",
    "the variability of mrk 421 increases with energy for both the low and high energy sed components .",
    "the source is highly variable in the x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray bands , with the normalized variability amplitudes greater than 70% ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "an overall cross - correlation analysis ( see table 2 ) between @xmath9-bat and argo - ybj data shows that the variabilities in x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays are generally correlated .",
    "the correlation is also clearly visible in the light curves during the large x - ray flares ( see figure 2 , 4 and 5 ) .",
    "our previous observations during the outburst of 2008 also show that x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays were tightly correlated with the peak times in good agreement with each other @xcite . a clear correlation between x - rays and vhe @xmath0-rays has also been reported in many observations in the past decades @xcite .",
    "all these results firmly support the idea that the x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray emissions of mrk 421 originate from the same zone .",
    "the variability amplitude in gev @xmath0-rays is 39% ( see figure 3 ) , which is less than that in vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of the gev @xmath0-ray variability is very low during most of the time , being only about 20% if the large gev @xmath0-ray flares f6 and f7 are excluded . the overall cross - correlation analysis ( see table 2 ) shows that gev @xmath0-rays are moderately correlated with vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "the gev and vhe @xmath0-ray light curves reported in figure 4 and 5 show an evident correlation only during f2 , f6 and f7 . according to the measurements shown in table 3 , during flares f3 , f4 , f5 and ob phase , the flux above 0.1 gev increases by 20%-46% with respect to the s1 steady state , while the vhe flux increases by 63%-275% . with these results",
    ", we could not therefore exclude the possibility that gev and tev @xmath0-rays are produced in different emission zones .",
    "a possible scenario would be that the observed emission is the superposition of one stationary zone with a steady gev emission and one active zone responsible for the vhe flux variation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , during flares f1 , f2 , f6 , and f7 , gev and tev @xmath0-rays show clear correlated variations , according to the seds reported in figure 7 .",
    "this could indicate that gev and tev emissions are generated in the same zone , at least during these phases .",
    "in particular during flare f1 the flux above 0.1 gev decreases of about ( 27@xmath6424)% . if this decrease is not due to a statistical fluctuation , the stationary zone would be excluded , and the above hypothesis of two emission zones could be excluded too . moreover , during f6 and f7 , the gev @xmath0-ray flux increases by a large amount ( 240%@xmath2295% ) , while the spectral indices were about consistent .",
    "also this result does not support the hypothesis of two zones , since the predicted spectrum at gev energies for the active zone is much harder than that for the steady zone , according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "compared to other wavebands , the flux variation at radio frequencies is much weaker . a radio flare is observed in 2012 , which is the largest radio flare ever observed in mrk 421 @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation analysis shows that this radio flare follows the gev @xmath0-ray flare with a time - lag of about 42 days ( see table 2 ) , which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "if the radio and gev @xmath0-ray flares are physically connected @xcite , then the gev @xmath0-ray emission could originate upstream of the radio emission .",
    "the distance between radio and gev @xmath0-ray emission sites and their distances to the central black hole have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the variability amplitude in the uv band is 33% , similar to that in gev @xmath0-rays , however according to the cross - correlation analysis ( see table 2 ) and to the light curves ( see figure 2 and 4 ) the uv flux appears not to be correlated with gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the uv flux does not even shown an evident correlation with x - rays . moreover , according to the sed of flare f1 shown in figure 7 , the uv and x - ray data can not be fitted together with a unique component .",
    "these results seem to indicate that the uv and x - ray emissions do not share the same origin .",
    "instead , the moderate correlation observed between uv and radio suggests that their emission regions could be the same , possibly located downstream of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission zone .",
    "therefore , the radio and uv data points were removed from the ssc model fitting .",
    "this choice is different from other authors , e.g. @xcite who included them when fitting the sed .",
    "finally , the ssc model generally under - predicts the uv and radio emissions .",
    "this supports our hypothesis that , at least partially , the radio and uv emission comes from regions in the jet not emitting x - rays and @xmath0-rays .    for the type t1 and t3 states ,",
    "the derived spectral indices @xmath96 are generally consistent with @xmath96=2.2 , i.e. the canonical particle spectral index predicted for relativistic diffuse shock acceleration ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that this process is active in mrk 421 .",
    "the change of the electron index @xmath179 = @xmath97 - @xmath96 is larger than the expected typical cooling break @xmath179 = 1 @xcite , indicating that the break is not induced by radiative cooling",
    ". the cooling mechanism may be less important , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculated that the steep break is a characteristic of the acceleration process which is not yet understood .",
    "the break energy @xmath98 should represent the maximum energy that can be achieved in the acceleration process , depending on the acceleration time of the particle in the shock area .",
    "accordingly , the flares of t1 type should be mainly caused by the variation of the maximum energy of the electrons reached within the shock area .",
    "concerning the type t3 flares ( i.e. , f6 and f7 ) , these flares might be due to the increase of the magnetic field ( b ) or comoving particle density ( @xmath180 ) compared to s1 .",
    "up to now , it is not yet clear how shocks work in a jet . if the different states detected in this work are caused by different shocks , we could expect different features of emission zones , such as b , @xmath109 , r , electron density and spectrum .",
    "if the different states are caused by similar shocks moving down the jet , we would expect emission zones with the same r , for all the states , as we assumed when fitting the sed using the ssc model .",
    "in such a hypothesis , we could guess that the underlying mechanism responsible for the flares of t1 and t3 types may be due to the variation of the ambient medium . in the theory of diffusive acceleration , the acceleration time scale of particles is related to the strength of the magnetic field both in upstream and downstream regions @xcite .",
    "the upstream magnetic field could be related to the ambient medium .",
    "the variation of the acceleration time scale may change the maximum energy of the particles achieved within the shock . when the density and the magnetic field of the ambient medium are different , the number of particles and the corresponding maximum energy can be different . in such a hypothesis , the variability time scale for each state would characterize the size of each medium block that is crossed by the shock .",
    "the t2 flares require a harder injected electron spectrum than the other types .",
    "this change would be caused by the acceleration processes .",
    "the slopes of f1 and f2 go beyond the predictions of a spectral index of 2.0 given by the canonical non - relativistic diffuse shock acceleration . according to @xcite , particle spectra with spectral indexes less than 2",
    "can be realized within the relativistic shock using extreme parameters , i.e. , large scattering angles . f1 and f2 flares only last a few days , which means that the produced electrons with spectral index less than 2.2 is a transient state and can not last for a long time .",
    "so , we can not exclude the possibility that such short flares are due to extreme parameters .",
    "another alternative mechanism for such a hard spectrum would be that the particles accelerated by the shock are subsequently accelerated by the stochastic process in the downstream region , which is able to produce spectra that are significantly harder than the limits of the first - order mechanism within a short time @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite also predicts a hard spectral index resulting from relativistic magnetic reconnection .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a 4.5-year continuous multi - wavelength monitoring of mrk 421 , from 2008 august 5 to 2013 february 7 , a period that includes both steady states and episodes of strong flaring activity .",
    "the observations concern a wide energy range , from radio to tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "in particular , thanks to the argo - ybj and @xmath1 data , the whole energy range from 100 mev to 10 tev is covered without any gap .",
    "these extensive datasets are essential for studying the origin of the flux variability and to investigate the underlying emission mechanism .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "mrk 421 showed both low and high activity phases at all wavebands during the 4.5 year period analyzed in this work .",
    "the variability increases with energy for both the sed components .",
    "concerning the synchrotron component , the variability amplitude increases from 21% in radio and 33% in uv to 71%-73% in soft x - rays and 103%-137% in hard x - rays . for the inverse compton component ,",
    "the amplitude is 39% at gev energies and increases to 84% at tev energies .",
    "the time correlation among the flux variation in different wavebands was analyzed .",
    "the variation of the x - ray flux is clearly correlated with the tev @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "this result is consistent with many previous observations in the past decades , supporting the idea that the x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray emissions originate from the same zone .",
    "the gev @xmath0-ray flux appears to be moderately correlated with the tev @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "this result is new compared to previous results .",
    "the correlation is mainly due to the large gev @xmath0-ray flares occurred in 2012 and a large x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flare in 2010 .",
    "taking into account the spectral shape during this flares , we can conclude that the gev and tev @xmath0-rays also originate from the same zone , at least during these flares . on the contrary , x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes",
    "are weakly or not correlated with radio and uv fluxes .",
    "\\3 . according to the observed light curves ,",
    "ten states ( two steady periods , s1 and s2 , one outburst period , ob , and seven large flares ) have been selected and analyzed .",
    "five flares have been identified in x - rays , and two in gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the duration of the flares ranges between 3 and 58 days .",
    "x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray fluxes increase during all the active states . in x - rays ,",
    "the flux increases by a factor 4@xmath270 and the peak energy increases from 0.4 kev to 1.4@xmath25.1 kev . at tev energies ,",
    "the flux has been observed to vary from 0.33 i@xmath68 to 7 i@xmath68 .",
    "\\4 . according to the behavior of gev @xmath0-rays",
    ", the activity states can be classified into three groups .",
    "( i ) flares with no or little gev flux and photon index variations , e.g. s1 , s2 , ob , f3 , f4 and f5 ; ( ii ) flares with @xmath0-ray spectral hardening , irrespective of the flux variations , e.g. f1 and f2 ; ( iii ) flares with flux enhancements , irrespective of spectral behavior , e.g. f6 and f7 .",
    "a simple one - zone ssc model is adopted to fit the multi - wavelength sed state by state .",
    "the ssc model can satisfactorily reproduce all the sed measurement except the @xmath9-xrt data below 0.5 kev , probably due to a detector systematics affecting the low energy events .",
    "for type i and iii states , the derived injected electron spectral indices are around 2.2 , as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration , indicating that this process can be active in mrk 421 .",
    "according to the derived parameters , the variation of these states may be caused by the variation of environment properties .",
    "instead , type ii flares require harder injected electron spectra , with spectral indices around 1.7@xmath21.9 .",
    "the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this type of flares may be related to the acceleration process itself .",

    "<S> we report on the extensive multi - wavelength observations of the blazar markarian 421 ( mrk 421 ) covering radio to @xmath0-rays , during the 4.5 year period of argo - ybj and fermi common operation time , from august 2008 to february 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> these long - term observations extending over an energy range of 18 orders of magnitude provide a unique chance to study the variable emission of mrk 421 . in particular , thanks to the argo - ybj and @xmath1 data , the whole energy range from 100 mev to 10 tev is covered without any gap . in the observation period , </S>",
    "<S> mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all wavebands . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray flux is clearly correlated with the tev @xmath0-ray flux , while gev @xmath0-rays only show a partial correlation with tev @xmath0-rays . </S>",
    "<S> radio and uv fluxes seem to be weakly or not correlated with the x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> seven large flares , including five x - ray flares and two gev @xmath0-ray flares with variable durations ( 3@xmath258 days ) , and one x - ray outburst phase were identified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy distribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase . during the outburst phase and the seven flaring episodes , </S>",
    "<S> the peak energy in x - rays is observed to increase from sub - kev to few kev . </S>",
    "<S> the tev @xmath0-ray flux increases up to 0.9@xmath27.2 times the flux of the crab nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of gev @xmath0-rays is found to vary depending on the flare , a feature that leads us to classify flares into three groups according to the gev flux variation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the one - zone synchrotron self - compton model was adopted to describe the emission spectra . </S>",
    "<S> two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected electrons with a power - law spectral index around 2.2 , as expected from relativistic diffuse shock acceleration , whereas the remaining group requires a harder injected spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for different groups may be related to the acceleration process or to the environment properties . </S>"
