    "on the pathway towards a prospective low carbon energy system , the share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources ( res ) in the european power supply system has increased significantly over the past years @xcite .",
    "ongoing concerns about climate change and the aim of many countries to become more independent from energy imports will likely lead to a further increase in the share of res in the european electricity supply system @xcite .",
    "in such a system , the major share of energy would be provided by wind and solar energy as they are considered to have the highest potential in europe @xcite . due to their natural origin",
    "the electricity produced from these sources is fluctuating strongly on both short - term ( seconds to hours ) and long - term scales ( months , years ) @xcite .",
    "as production and consumption in a power supply system always need to be balanced , there is a requirement for reserve power capacities to ensure the security of supply , in the form of either quickly adjustable back - up power plants ( operated e.g.  on gas ) or storage units @xcite .",
    "storages can store surplus electricity generated when the production from res exceeds the demand and , hence , reduce the need for curtailment of electricity produced from res @xcite .    already with today",
    "s european power supply system with slightly more than 20% of the electricity demand covered from res @xcite , it is debated which share of electricity produced from fluctuating res the current power supply system can handle .",
    "according to a contribution by hart et al .",
    "@xcite the integration of res in the power system can generally be characterised by two phases : up to a certain penetration of res , all the electricity produced from res can be fed into the system , thus the integration of res scales linearly with res capacities @xcite .",
    "after a certain transition point , the electricity production from res occasionally exceeds the energy demand implying the need for curtailment of res to ensure grid stability @xcite . in this second phase",
    "the integration of res scales less than linear with the installed capacities @xcite .",
    "another contribution investigated the effect of transmission grid extension on this integration process @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that a powerful overlay transmission grid significantly reduced overproduction and back - up capacity requirements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , grid expansion was found to be also favourable from an economic perspective over only installing more variable renewable energy capacities @xcite .",
    "in addition to back - up power plants many studies dealing with prospective power supply systems with a high share of res investigate the utilisation of storage devices to balance the fluctuations in the electricity production from res ( see e.g.  @xcite for europe , @xcite for australia and @xcite for the united states ) .",
    "some of these studies implement very detailed assumptions on the cost for installation and operation of relevant units @xcite . in order to promote a deeper understanding of the dependencies and implications relevant for the transformation of the power supply system ,",
    "however , systematic investigations of fundamental aspects of the integration of res are required .",
    "this paper addresses the impact of storages on the integration of res in general and the importance of their size and efficiency in particular .",
    "both the general approach and the results obtained for germany are intended to set the stage for more detailed studies on the economic aspects on their integration and operation .",
    "a prospective power supply system based almost entirely on res will depend strongly on wind and solar resources and , hence , needs to deal with their intrinsic variability .",
    "this work focusses on the large - scale integration of res from a meteorological perspective . for this purpose",

    "is used . for reasonable conclusions regarding the required storage size , the time increment @xmath5 needs to be sufficiently small , since relevant effects might disappear at larger time scales . ]",
    "it is assumed that the data is corrected for systematic changes during the period of analysis .",
    "the resource data can either stem from measurements on existing systems or , as in the case investigated in more detail in section [ sec : application - germany ] , from meteorological simulations . in order to ease a scaling of the generation data for the investigation of different installed capacities the generation data is normalised and expressed in units of the average electricity demand in the respective observation intervals . with @xmath6",

    "the methods developed in the previous section are now applied to specific data in order to study the role of energy storage devices for the integration of res in future power systems . due to the availability of resource and demand data as well as a res penetration of over 20% in its electricity system @xcite",

    "is estimated using long - term solar ( @xmath43 ) and wind energy ( @xmath44 ) power output data series with hourly resolution ( @xmath45 ) spanning eight years from 2000 to 2007 and based on reanalysis data ( for details we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "we only handle aggregated time series and do not consider limitations and effects of the national grid .",

    "we checked if the initial charging level of the storage @xmath37 has an influence on the results and we found that the results only change by a maximum of 0.1% in all cases considered in this work .",
    "hence , the initial charging level of the storage was set to @xmath49 without further discussion .      the renewable integration function @xmath26 for the case of no storage and selected wind shares @xmath21",

    "there is no overproduction , hence all curves rise linearly in this section . with increasing power generation factor @xmath14 overproduction",
    "occurs more and more frequently and the curves bend down due to curtailment . the transition point between the linear regime and the curtailment regime depends on the wind share @xmath21 . in a solar - only scenario ( @xmath51 )",
    "the effects of curtailment become relevant already at @xmath52 .",
    "previous investigations have shown that the overproduction is mainly due to the solar production peak around noon .",
    "the curves with @xmath53 are the topmost , in accordance with @xcite the overproduction is least with a mix of solar and wind energy in this regime .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we will use a wind share of @xmath54 for the following results .",
    "for this wind share , the transition occurs at about @xmath55 . however , sooner or later the renewable integration functions flatten out significantly independently of the wind share @xmath21 , implying that a massive installation of additional production capacities would be needed to increase the integration of res up to 100% .",
    "thus , after a certain penetration of res , the installation of storage capacities is likely to be worthwhile .     for the case without any storage and selected wind shares @xmath21 ]    if storages are available , parts of the otherwise curtailed energy can be fed into the system again , whereas the amount of reusable energy depends on storage size and round - trip efficiency ( cf.eq .",
    "( [ eq : re_infty ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the renewable integration function @xmath28 after the transition point increases compared to the case without any storage .    for an unlimited storage without any losses ( @xmath57 ) , all electricity produced during periods of overproduction can be fed into the system again in times of underproduction .",
    "hence , the transition point between the linear regime and the curtailment regime moves to @xmath58 .",
    "we estimated the storage size required to have the same properties as an infinitely large storage device by calculating the spread of the cumulative sum of the mismatch function @xmath59 . in a scenario for germany with a wind share of @xmath54 and an average renewable energy power generation factor of @xmath60 , a loss - free storage device ( @xmath57 )",
    "would need to have a size in the order of 80 twh .",
    "this is orders of magnitudes higher than today s storage capacities in germany ( 39  gwh for pumped - hydro storage according to @xcite ) and even higher than europe s total hydrogen storage potential in salt caverns ( 32  twh according to @xcite ) .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : re_infty ] ) with unlimited storage capacities , a 100% res scenario would always be possible . in order to balance the losses of the storage , however",
    ", additional generation capacities would need to be installed .",
    "the extent of these overcapacities depends on the round - trip and increases e.g.  to @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : samplere0 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : reofhmax ] the transition between the previously discussed cases of no storage and unlimited storage capacities can be observed .",
    "furthermore , one can see that already a storage with a capacity of only @xmath65 significantly increases the integration of res .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that already the availability of small storage devices increases the integration of solar energy significantly and extents its usability to the evenings .",
    "the effect of storages decreases with their size .     for different storage sizes @xmath16 and storage round - trip efficiency @xmath64 .",
    "dashed lines represent additional intermediate storage sizes ( cf .",
    "[ ssec : datagermany ] ) ]    finally , let us come back to the question raised in the introduction , how soon will we need storage devices when increasing the share of res .",
    "figure [ fig : de_comp_twostorages ] shows the evolution of the renewable integration function @xmath66 for two different storage classes , first , small and highly efficient storages ( @xmath67 , @xmath15=0.8 ) such as e.g.  pumped - hydro storage facilities and second , large storages with reduced efficiency ( @xmath68 , @xmath15=0.3 ) , as it e.g.  can be assumed for seasonal storages based on synthetic hydrogen . for comparison , the evolution of the renewable integration function without storage @xmath69 and unlimited storage without any losses @xmath70",
    "are also plotted .",
    "one can see that up to a share of about 50% of the energy demand met by res the curves do not exhibit significant differences .",
    "that is , no storage would be needed until this point , provided that the remaining load can be met by fully flexible power plants as assumed in this approach . for a share of about 50 - 80% of the energy demand met by wind and solar energy , a small but efficient storage can achieve a better integration of res than a large but less efficient storage device . only for higher shares of res",
    "their integration is higher with large seasonal storage . with this storage",
    "a 100% res scenario would be possible with a power generation factor @xmath14 in the order of about @xmath14=1.5 .",
    "for a better discussion of the results and a comparison with more recent data , corresponding calculations were done using a different data source spanning the years from 2006 to 2012 .",
    "apart from minor quantitative differences , both data sets lead to the comparable results that up to 50% of the electricity demand could be met without storage ; and small but highly efficient storage devices should be favoured over large but less efficient storage devices to reach a share of about 80% of the electricity demand being met by res .",
    "systematic differences between the observation periods 2000 - 2008 and 2006 - 2012 were not found .",
    "for details we refer to [ sec : appendix - secdata ] .     for two different storage classes : comparison between small , highly efficient storages and large , less efficient ones .",
    "black lines represent the case of no storage as well as infinitely large loss - free storages . ]",
    "these results mean that at the beginning of the res integration process rather small and highly efficient storage devices are sufficient if combined with flexible fossil power plants . only when it comes to integrating very high shares of res , hence having a system of almost 100% res , seasonal storage devices are needed .",
    "alternatively , overcapacities could be installed to reach a 100% res system while requiring less storage capacity .",
    "hence , a compromise between the installation of overcapacities and the installation of storage capacities has to be found .",
    "in the previous section , we focussed on the conceptual question on how to include different storage parameters when studying the integration of res in prospective power supply systems .",
    "we now take a look at three further aspects closely related to the previous results , namely the dependence of the storage requirements on the mix between wind and solar resources , the economic impact of our previous findings and the implications of the size of the investigated region .",
    "we have shown above that the penetration of res at which overproduction and hence possible curtailment starts to take place depends on the mix between solar and wind energy ( cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : samplere0 ] ) . in the subsequent results ,",
    "the wind share was fixed to @xmath71 , which was found to be in the range of the optimal mix for minimum storage capacities . to investigate the influence of the mix in more detail , figure [ fig : distr_h4 ] shows for each generation factor @xmath14 the ratio of the integration for each wind share @xmath21 to the integration of the wind share @xmath21 with the best integration for this generation factor @xmath14 . here , a particular storage size of @xmath67 with a round - trip efficiency @xmath64 is considered .",
    "the blue area represents parameters for which the integration is at least 95@xmath72 of the maximum value . in accordance with figure [ fig : samplere0 ] for @xmath73 the integration does not depend on the wind share @xmath21 . for higher values of @xmath14 ( corresponding to higher res capacities ) ,",
    "the optimal wind share @xmath21 lies in the range of @xmath74 .",
    "any wind share @xmath21 is this range leads to a curve which differs less than 5% from the integration at the best wind share @xmath21 . with increasing generation factor @xmath14",
    ", the blue area widens towards higher and lower values of @xmath21 , hence for larger installed capacities the integration becomes less sensitive to the wind share @xmath21 .",
    "overall , these results imply that the mix between wind and solar capacities is especially important during the transition process ( @xmath75 ) to best integrate res . for lower and higher penetrations of res , however , a broad range of wind shares @xmath21 leads to an optimal integration of res .     on maximum curve for storage with @xmath67 and round - trip efficiency @xmath64",
    "for each power generation factor @xmath14 , the figure shows how close the value @xmath76 for each wind share @xmath21 is compared to the maximum value for this power generation factor @xmath14 .",
    "the blue area ( inner part of the figure ) represents parameters where the integration is at least 95% of the maximum value . ]",
    "the results shown in this work are based mainly on meteorological aspects and the resulting fluctuations in the power production from solar and wind resources as well as the load patterns in the current power supply system .",
    "we eventually take a look at the economic impact of our previous findings . as shown in figures [ fig : samplere0]-[fig : de_comp_twostorages ] , there is a linear regime at the beginning of the integration of renewable energy sources , implying all electricity produced by res can be integrated completely into the electricity grid .",
    "provided that the remaining back - up power plants are fully flexible , the installation of storage devices is economically not directly profitable in this regime .",
    "once curtailment sets in implying that the curves for the respective renewable integration functions bend downwards , there are different pathways to increase the share of energy demand met by res : one option is to install storage capacities ( cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : reofhmax ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the same share can be achieved by constructing additional power generation capacities , hence increase the generation factor @xmath14 . if the latter option is chosen , however , the system operator ( referring to e.g.  the grid operator , the government , the overall society or anyone responsible for the stable supply of electricity ) has to find a way to make the new investments profitable for an investor .",
    "let us look again at the case of germany shown before in figure [ fig : de_comp_twostorages ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : compareslope ] shows the slope , denoted @xmath77 , of the renewable integration function @xmath78 as a function of the generation factor @xmath14 for the different cases discussed previously . for scenarios with a share of energy demand being met by res above 80% , hence @xmath79 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : de_comp_twostorages ] ) , the slope @xmath77 is at a value of @xmath80 .",
    "this would mean that in this simplified scenario less than half of the additionally producible electricity could be fed into the system .",
    "either this would seriously affect the return on investment of additional conversion facilities or alternatively all previously installed res capacities would have to slightly curtail their electricity production .",
    "both effects would have a high impact on decisions regarding the investment into additional generation capacities .     of the renewable integration function @xmath78 as a function of the renewable energy power generation factor @xmath14 for two different storage classes as well as the case of no storage and infinitely large storages .",
    "]    in addition to the capacity of the storages , from an economic point of view also the required converter power for charging and discharging are relevant . the model presented in this work for reasons of simplicity does not incorporate any restrictions in the converter power and ,",
    "hence , does not enforce an economic utilisation of the converters . in the scenario with a wind share @xmath54 and a power generation factor @xmath47 the realised power of a storage device with @xmath81 and round - trip efficiency @xmath64 e.g.  was about @xmath82 ( 95% quantile : @xmath83 ) for discharging and @xmath84 ( 95% quantile : @xmath85 ) for charging , respectively .",
    "these values are much higher than the converter power requirements found in a similar studies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which do take into account economic aspects in the operation of storages and backup power .",
    "since the utilization of converters in the present contribution is not optimized , derived parameters such as capacity factors for the storage devices are not meaningful and can not be included in an evaluation of economic aspects as e.g. done by @xcite .    limiting the admissible converter power of the storage devices in the simulations presented here in particular for smaller storage sizes",
    "does not necessarily imply significant changes in the results for the renewable integration function , since the limits initially only change the interaction between storage devices and back - up power plants ( restricting e.g.  the power of the storage with size @xmath81 to their 95% quantile did not have any significant effect ) . a detailed and systematic discussion of the impact of converter power , which would be required for full evaluation of economical aspects of the integration of storages , however",

    "the model developed in this work focusses on the role of storage devices for the integration of res while treating the simulated domain as a copper plate .",
    "grid limitations are not considered .",
    "instead we assume that the production from res and the demand can be balanced without constraints throughout the entire simulation domain .",
    "consequently the integration of renewables is generally promoted with increasing size of the simulation domain @xcite , since fluctuations in production and consumption decorrelate with increasing scales . by expanding our model to a european scale the renewable integration function for a storage device with size @xmath86 for instance increases from @xmath87 for germany to @xmath88 . in this respect",
    ", the effect of imports and exports to foreign grids could be regarded as a virtual storage .",
    "however , the positive effects of enlarging the investigated region are restricted by the capacity of the grid ( in particular but not limited to interconnectors ) @xcite . in practise",
    "these restrictions would need to be solved either by expansion and enforcement of distribution and transmission grids or by the installation of additional storages to overcome local bottlenecks .",
    "for this reason the results derived from our approach for large - scale systems with rather mature transmission grids ( such as e.g.  germany and europe ) exhibit lower bounds for the actual storage demand .",
    "the transformation of the european power supply system to one based on renewable energy sources ( res ) is a challenging task  yet it is achievable . in order to balance the fluctuations in the power production from wind and solar energy , the installation of storage capacities will likely be required .",
    "the storage modelling approach developed in this work allows to systematically study the integration process of res in a power system depending on the round - trip efficiency and the size of the storage .    applying our approach to data for germany",
    ", we found that up to 50% of the electricity demand could be met by res without storage  provided that an optimal mix between wind and solar power generation is chosen and the remaining power plants are fully flexible .",
    "this result is in line with recently published case studies for germany @xcite and denmark @xcite .",
    "the required flexibility is , however , currently only the case for parts of the german generation portfolio . in a scenario with these flexible back - up power plants ,",
    "though , small but highly efficient storage devices should be favoured over large but less efficient ( seasonal ) storage devices to reach a share of about 80% of the electricity demand being met by res .",
    "eventually a balance between the installation of additional generation capacities and of storage capacities has to be found . in this context also",
    "the required power of the storage converters needs to be taken into account , which is economically relevant but beyond the scope of the current modelling approach .",
    "the overall transformation process involves many different aspects . even if only technological parameters are considered , current energy system models tend to get very complex . by focussing our work on two key parameters of modelling energy storage devices ,",
    "we are able to systematically study the role of storage devices for the integration process of res . our approach and its findings can now be used in upcoming modelling approaches of future power systems . by considering more and more elements that very likely have an impact on a future power supply system ,",
