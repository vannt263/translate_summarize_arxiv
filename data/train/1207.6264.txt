    "isotope shift ( is ) measurements have a long tradition and are known as a valuable source for information about ( changes in ) the nuclear charge radii and distributions .",
    "adding one or several neutrons makes the nuclei not only heavier , but may also modify its charge distribution quite remarkably  @xcite . during the last decades",
    ", optical laser spectroscopy considerably contributed to the field as an important alternative to a number of earlier x - ray measurements in muonic atoms or electron scattering experiments  @xcite . using optical laser spectroscopy , measurements became possible for quite long sequences of stable and radioactive isotopes  @xcite .",
    "a particular merit of this method is that it provides nuclear - model - independent data if the electronic part of the isotope shifts is known sufficiently well .",
    "however , the determination of the electronic parameters through ab initio calculations is still a challenge for atomic theory owing to the high sensitivity of the is parameters with regard to electron correlation and the representation of the wave functions , especially for ( nearly- ) neutral atoms and ions  @xcite .",
    "the electronic contributions to the isotope shifts can be theoretically attained with relatively high precision and reliability for few - electron ions , but as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it would be still desirable to have more accurate results for the electronic parameters with up - to - date theoretical methods .    following the theoretical investigation on the effects of the nuclear charge distribution upon the total cross - section of dielectronic recombination for li - like heavy ions by chiopu  @xcite ,",
    "isotope shifts of the @xmath1 transitions have been measured recently at the experimental storage ring at gsi darmstadt ( germany ) for the two stable even - even isotopes @xmath2nd and @xmath3nd of li - like neodymium  @xcite . from these measurements",
    ", it was shown that dielectronic recombination supplies a new technique to derive information on the nuclear charge distributions of heavy stable and unstable elements , provided the electronic parameters are available from theory .",
    "as far as li - like ions are concerned , many investigations were performed .",
    "however , most of them are focused on neutral li  @xcite ( and references therein ) and be@xmath4 ion  @xcite where nuclear halo structures were predicted some years ago .",
    "godefroid have studied the isotope shifts of low - lying levels for li i through o vi using the multiconfiguration hartree - fock method  @xcite .",
    "kozhedub  @xcite calculated recently the relativistic mass shift for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions along the li - like isoelectronic sequence",
    ". nevertheless , the isotope shift parameters are scarce for li - like ions , especially for the field shift electronic factors .    in this work",
    ", we present the electronic parameters relevant to the isotope shift for the two @xmath0 transitions in li - like ions in the range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "the electron correlation and breit interaction are treated within the framework of the multiconfiguration dirac - hartree - fock ( mcdf ) method .",
    "comparison is made with other theoretical predictions , when available . using our calculated parameters the balance between the mass shifts and the field shifts of these two transitions",
    "is discussed along the isoelectronic sequence with the assistance of the simple empirical formulae for the nuclear mass number and the nuclear mean - square radius .",
    "in addition we investigate in great detail the case of @xmath9nd@xmath10 for which experimental is measurements were recently reported  @xcite .",
    "in the approximation of the first - order perturbation theory , the isotope shift , for a transition involving the atomic states @xmath11 and @xmath12 between two isotopes with mass numbers @xmath13 , can be parameterized as  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 refers to the relativistic mass shift parameter and @xmath16 is the field shift factor ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the nuclear masses and @xmath19 represents the nuclear mean - square radius difference between two isotopes @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the mass - shift parameter @xmath22 is related to the expectation value of the relativistic recoil hamiltonian @xmath23 the recoil hamiltonian , correct to the order of @xmath24 in the mass ratio of the electron and nucleus , is given by  @xcite @xmath25 \\cdot { \\bm p}_j \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is split into the one - body and the two - body relativistic mass shift operators @xmath26 \\cdot { \\bm p}_i \\right\\ } , \\\\",

    "p}_j \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] referred respectively as the relativistic normal mass shift ( rnms ) and specific mass shift ( rsms ) terms .",
    "adopting this partition , the transition isotope shift ( [ mf - eq ] ) becomes @xmath27    note that the normal mass shift values reported in the present work are estimated using the perturbation approach from the expectation values of the rnms operator rather than adopting the scaling law ( @xmath28 ) that becomes inappropriate for heavy relativistic systems  @xcite .",
    "the field shift factor appearing in eq .",
    "( [ mf - eq ] ) has the form  @xcite @xmath29 which is proportional to the change of the electronic total probability density @xmath30 at the origin between the two atomic states involved in the transition , i.e.  @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33      the multiconfiguration dirac - hartree - fock ( mcdf ) method  @xcite is employed to yield atomic state wave functions ( asfs ) . on the basis of the mcdf method ,",
    "the asf is represented by a linear combination of configuration state functions ( csfs ) with same parity @xmath34 , total angular momentum @xmath35 and its component along @xmath36-direction @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the mixing coefficients and @xmath40 the sets of other quantum numbers needed for specifying the @xmath41 csfs .",
    "the latter are built from single - electron orbital wave functions . applying the variational principle , the mixing coefficients @xmath42 and single - electron orbital wave functions",
    "are optimized simultaneously via the self - consistent field ( scf ) method .",
    "a more limited version is the relativistic configuration interaction ( rci ) approach allowing only the mixing coefficients to be varied . in the rci computation",
    ", the breit interaction can be taken into account perturbatively as well .",
    "it should be emphasized that instead of a point - like nucleus , a finite nuclear charge distribution model , for instance , a uniform spherical model or a two - parameters fermi model , must be used to generate the nuclear potential in the calculation in order to ensure the first - order perturbation to be valid for the field shift  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the two - parameters fermi nuclear model @xmath43 is adopted .",
    "here @xmath44 is a normalization coefficient , @xmath45 is the half - density radius and @xmath46 is related to the surface thickness @xmath47 of the charge distribution . in practice , the @xmath48 value is used and @xmath45 is computed according to the formulae given in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the asfs are insensitive with respect to details of the nuclear model @xcite , the nuclear parameters from any stable isotope can be chosen to perform the scf and rci calculations .",
    "the active space approach is utilized for building the asf in order to capture the main correlation effects systematically . in this framework ,",
    "the configuration space is expanded by means of single ( s ) and double ( d ) excitations from occupied orbitals to some active set .",
    "the latter is augmented layer by layer , which makes it possible to monitor the convergence of the physical quantity concerned . each correlation layer , labelled by @xmath49 ,",
    "contains the @xmath50 orbitals ( @xmath51 ) . starting with dirac - hartree - fock ( df ) calculations ,",
    "mcdf calculations are carried out sequentially to optimize the correlation orbitals in the added layer , together with the mixing coefficients .",
    "the breit interaction is taken into account in the subsequent rci computations .",
    "the calculations are performed by using the grasp2k package  @xcite in which relativistic mass shifts corrections are implemented  @xcite . for cross - checking our investigations on some cases , we also use the mcdf - gme package  @xcite .",
    "being interested in the entire isoelectronic lithium sequence and realizing the importance of correlation effects in the neutral end , we test our computational strategy on be@xmath4 . for this ion ,",
    "we present in table [ tab:1 ] the relativistic normal mass shift ( @xmath52 ) , the relativistic specific mass shift ( @xmath53 ) and the field shift ( @xmath16 ) factors for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 transitions , omitting the breit interaction in the calculations . as can be seen from this table , sd excitations up to @xmath56 are essential to bring these values to the demanded precision .",
    "however , one observes that the relativistic normal mass shift in these transitions is more sensitive to correlation due to large cancellation when making the difference between the level shifts considered .",
    "complete convergence of these physical quantities is considerably hard to achieve , but we control the uncertainties within @xmath57  % for the total mass shift and the field shift .",
    "furthermore , we perform additional rci calculations by appending the triple ( t ) excitations from the occupied orbitals to the active set of @xmath58 , to the largest sd configuration space ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the corresponding values marked as sdt are displayed in the same table .",
    "it is found that the contribution of triple excitations is definitely fractional .",
    "we should keep in mind that some orbitals are kept frozen in the layer - by - layer calculations to avoid convergence problems .",
    "the corresponding loss of orbital relaxation can be estimated with the mcdf - gme package  @xcite that allows to optimize all orbitals variationally . in this calculation , the sdt excitations up to @xmath56 are used to generate the configuration space .",
    "the mcdf - gme results are listed in the last row in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the satisfactory consistency between the results obtained by these two independent codes is on line with the 1% estimated uncertainty for the calculated shifts and demonstrates the adequacy of the computation strategy described in section  [ ssec : cm ] that is used for heavier ions .",

    "the calculations are carried out using different computational models , namely , df , mcdf , and mcdf+breit . the differences between the mcdf and df results reflect the correlations between the electrons .",
    "since the correlation effects become usually less important for high-@xmath83 ions , we have reduced gradually the size of active orbital set with increasing the nuclear charge .",
    "based on the mcdf model , the breit interaction is included into the values denoted by the `` mcdf+breit '' label .",
    "it is observed that both the electron correlation and the breit interaction contribute little to the total mass shift and field shift factors in these two transitions , although the effect is larger for the @xmath52 contribution .",
    "furthermore , we find out that the two - body part of the mass shift operator is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the one - body part in the middle- and high-@xmath83 region .",

    "it is worth noting that the trend of @xmath79 for the @xmath54 transition is not monotonous due to the fact that the relativistic corrections to the mass shift become important in the heavy elements . for this line ,",
    "the contribution of the second term of eq .",
    "( [ rnro ] ) to the total line mass shift , counteracting the first term , increases drastically with the nuclear charge ( 10% in fe@xmath87 , 47% in nd@xmath10 and 90% in th@xmath88 ) .",
    "note that the qed contribution to the recoil operator , calculated by kozhedub  @xcite and omitted in the present work , becomes larger than the relativistic contribution for the high-@xmath83 region .",
    "the field shift factors for these two transitions however increase considerably rapidly along the isoelectronic sequence .",
    "the uncertainties of the mass- and field - shift parameters presented in table [ tab:3 ] and [ tab:4 ] mainly result from the electron correlation effects for the low-@xmath83 ions . as discussed in section",
    "[ ce ] , the effects lead to about 1% errors along the isoelectronic sequence .",
    "moreover , we neglect the frequency - dependent breit interaction ( fdbi ) and the quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) corrections in the present calculations and these increase for the high-@xmath83 ions .",
