    "an increasing number of works has been recently dedicated to the study of the reionization of the universe ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; valageas & silk 1999 ; ciardi 2000 , cfgj ; miralda - escud , haehnelt & rees 2000 ; chiu & ostriker 2000 ; bruscoli 2000 ; gnedin 2000 ; benson 2000 ) which use both analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "an important refinement has been introduced by the proper treatment of a number of feedback effects ranging from the mechanical energy injection to the h@xmath6 photodissociating radiation produced by massive stars ( cfgj ) .",
    "however , probably the major ingredient still lacking for a physically complete description of the reionization process is the correct treatment of the transfer of ionizing photons from their production site into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "attempts based on different approximated techniques have been proposed ( razoumov & scott 1999 ; abel , norman & madau 1999 ; norman , paschos & abel 1998 ; gnedin 2000 ; umemura , nakamoto & susa 1999 ) , which sometimes are not readily implemented in cosmological simulations .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to develop exact and fast methods that can eventually yield a better treatment of the propagation of ionization fronts in the early universe .",
    "the first three papers are based on the ray - tracing method , whereas gnedin ( 2000 ) uses the so called local optical depth approximation .",
    "finally umemura , nakamoto & susa ( 1999 ) implemented a time - independent ray - tracing method .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) methods have been widely used in several physical / astrophysical areas to tackle radiative transfer problems ( for a reference book see cashwell & everett 1959 ) and they have been shown to result in fast and accurate schemes . here",
    "we build up on previous experience of our group ( bianchi , ferrara & giovanardi 1996 ; ferrara 1996 ; ferrara 1999 ; bianchi 2000 ) in dealing with mc problems to present a case study of cosmological h@xmath7 regions produced by the first stellar sources .",
    "the study is intended as a test of the applicability of the adopted techniques in conjunction with cosmological simulations in terms of convergency , accuracy , and speed of the scheme .    as an example of interesting cosmological application",
    ", we study the reionization produced by a stellar source of total mass @xmath1 turning on at @xmath2 , located at a node of the cosmic web .",
    "the study includes a spectral energy distribution of a zero - metallicity stellar population , and two initial mass functions ( salpeter / larson ) ; the igm spatial density distribution is deduced from high resolution cosmological simulations described below .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will then improve the results of cfgj by exploiting the strength of the mc method to release the approximations relative to the radiative transfer made in that paper .",
    "we have studied the evolution of small scale cosmic structure in a standard @xmath0+cdm model with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the baryon contribution to @xmath10",
    "is @xmath11 , the adopted value of the hubble constant is @xmath12  km  sec@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .",
    "the initial conditions are produced with the cosmics code adopting a normalization @xmath14 for the power spectrum . the initial particle distribution ( at redshift @xmath15 )",
    "is made out of a @xmath16 grid in a box of @xmath17  mpc ( comoving ) , thus giving a mass per particle of about @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt vacuum boundary conditions ; this requires the initial box to be reshaped . assuming that tidal forces from large scale fluctuations are negligible for this problem",
    ", we cut a sphere of radius @xmath19  mpc from the initial cube and follow the evolution of the system in isolation . in practice , we study the evolution of a central sphere of radius about @xmath20  mpc in full mass resolution with a coarse resampling of the most external particles . in the hi - resolution ( central )",
    "region the number of particles is 2313847 , whereas the rebinning left us with 10008 particles of variable mass ( increasing with distance from the center ) in the external @xmath21  mpc shell .",
    "we evolve this initial matter distribution with gadget ( springel , yoshida & white 2000 ) , a parallel n - body tree - code with an sph scheme to describe hydrodynamical processes .",
    "sph particles are placed on top of hi - resolution dark matter particles with the same velocity and a low initial temperature ( about @xmath22  k , the temperature of intergalactic medium as determined by adiabatic expansion of the universe after decoupling ) ; the mass of each fluid particle is rescaled according to the baryon and matter fraction quoted above .",
    "the ( spline ) softening length is @xmath23  kpc for the gas particles , and @xmath24  kpc for hi - resolution dark matter particles , respectively . for the problem at study here ,",
    "the simulation is stopped at @xmath25 , thus avoiding the very strong nonlinear phase in which our assumption of zero tidal effects from large scale structure would break down .",
    "the gas - dynamics evolution is purely adiabatic in order to reasonably limit the integration time .",
    "thus , we are not able to follow the details of cooling processes that ultimately lead to the formation of very dense and cold star forming regions",
    ". however , the density field of the mildy overdense igm should be reasonably well described by this assumption .",
    "our mass resolution does not also allow a full resolution of the jeans mass , and therefore the presence of sub - grid structure that we can not track is expected .",
    "this is a problem common to all presently available simulations , implying that the treatment of igm clumping is only approximate , as recently pointed out by haiman , abel & madau ( 2000 ) .",
    "simulations were performed on the cray - t3e at rechenzentrum - garching , the joint computing center of the max - planck - gesellschaft and max - planck - institut fuer plasmaphysik .",
    "finally , from the sph particle temperature and density distribution we reconstruct a central cubic region of @xmath26 cells , the grid values of any field being evaluated from particle values with an sph - like interpolation . for the reionization study presented below ,",
    "we have concentrated , as an example , on a source located at redshift @xmath27 immersed in the density field calculated from the simulations described above . the location and mass of the dark matter halos in the simulation",
    "have been determined by means of a friend - of - friend algorithm .",
    "we have then selected a halo suitably located in the node of a cosmic filamentary structure and associated a luminous source to it .",
    "the total halo mass is @xmath28 ; the corresponding stellar mass has been determined following the same prescriptions of cfgj , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fraction of virialized baryons able to cool and become available to form stars , and @xmath31 is the star formation efficiency .",
    "although with our cell size of 15 kpc we are marginally able to resolve the source ( comoving ) virial radius ( about 20 kpc ) , we do not attempt to treat the the escape of ionizing photons ( dove , shull & ferrara 2000 ; wood & loeb 2000 ) from the galaxy interstellar medium .",
    "instead we take a fixed value for this quantity equal to @xmath32 , the upper limit obtained by the above studies , by which we multiply the source ionizing photon flux .",
    "-2truecm    the seds of metal free star systems used in this paper were calculated implementing the synthetic evolutionary code developed for a simple stellar population ( brocato 1999 , brocato 2000 ) . for a detailed description of the computational procedure",
    "we refer to those papers ; here we just outline that the results of this code have been largely tested on young lmc clusters and old galactic globular clusters showing a very good agreement .",
    "the present synthesis models rely on the set of homogeneous evolutionary computations for stars with a cosmological amount of heavy elements and helium ( z=10@xmath33 and y=0.23 ) presented by cassisi & castellani ( 1993 ) and cassisi , castellani & tornamb ( 1996 ) and properly extended to higher masses in order to cover a wide range of ages .",
    "all the major evolutionary phases are taken into account , both the h and the he burning phase for stars with original masses in the range 0.7@xmath3440 m@xmath35 , for which the he burning phase is followed up to the carbon ignition or , alternatively , to the onset of the thermal pulses .",
    "models atmospheres are by kurucz ( 1993 ) for metallicity z=2@xmath36 .",
    "the available temperatures range from 3700  k to 50000  k , so the spectra at higher temperatures and gravity are simply extrapolated in order to keep the homogeneity of the grid .",
    "the wavelength range is from 91     to 160  @xmath37 m and the spectral resolution is typically 10 - 20     in the uv to optical bands .",
    "we consider an instantaneous burst of star formation assuming that masses range from 1  @xmath38 , as recently suggested for pop  iii stars by nakamura & umemura ( 1999a , 1999b ) , to 40  @xmath38 and two cases for the imf : @xmath39 a standard salpeter law , and @xmath40 a salpeter function at the upper mass end which falls off exponentially below a characteristic stellar mass @xmath41 ( larson 1998 ) . the last case is taken into account since both theory of thermo - dynamical condition of primordial gas and the absence of observations of solar mass , metal free stars seem to suggest at birth a paucity of low mass stars .",
    "moreover , the mass interval used in this paper properly describes population models of age down to 5  myr , the lifetime of a 40 m@xmath42 star ; therefore , the burst models of this age are actually populated by 1 - 40  m@xmath42 stars .",
    "the resulting grid of seds were calculated at intervals of 1 , 10 and 50  myr between 1 and 20  myr , 20 and 100  myr , and 100 and 150  myr , respectively .",
    "other calculations of zero - metallicity star seds are present in the literature ( see e.g. cojazzi 2000 ; tumlinson & shull 2000 ) , but they do not show the detailed sed time evolution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the adopted seds for the salpeter imf and the larson imf with @xmath43 .",
    "the two sets of curves do not differ sensibly in their spectral shape evolution but the larson imf has about 4 times larger specific photon flux at the lyman continuum . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the time evolution of the total number of ionizing photons ( in units of @xmath44 ) emitted by a solar mass of metal free stars with the two imfs .",
    "after about @xmath45  yr both curves flatten as a consequence of the decreasing number of surviving massive stars .    -2truecm    it is important to note that , during the first 5 myr , a zero - metallicity stellar cluster with a salpeter imf has an ionizing photon rate about 25 times higher than the analogous one for a 1% solar metallicity used by cfgj . as we will see later ,",
    "this has important effects on the reionization process .",
    "the application of mc schemes to radiative transfer problems requires that the radiation field is discretized in a representative number of photon packets , @xmath46 . the processes involved ( packet emission and absorption ) are then treated statistically by randomly sampling the appropriate distribution function .",
    "let us consider a source of bolometric luminosity @xmath47 and lifetime @xmath48 ( @xmath47 can be a function of time as our method easily allows to treat short - lived and variable sources ) .",
    "packets have the same energy , @xmath49 , but contain a different number of monochromatic photons , @xmath50 , of frequency @xmath51 so that for the @xmath52-th packet it is @xmath53 ; their rate is @xmath54 and the simulation time when the @xmath52-th photon packet is emitted is then @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 .",
    "the number of photons in each packet emitted by the source during @xmath48 is : [ fotnumb ] n_(j ) = e_s_p h ( j ) = l t_s_p h ( j ) .",
    "the packet frequency , @xmath51 , is obtained by sampling the source sed , @xmath58 : if @xmath59 is a random number , @xmath51 is given implicitly by : r_=__h^d s( ) ^-1 , [ nu ] where @xmath60 is the threshold for hydrogen ionization .",
    "we adopt spherical coordinates ( @xmath61 ) with origin at the source location ( @xmath62 ) in the box , such that the cartesian coordinates are : @xmath63    assuming that the emission is isotropic and spherically symmetric , photon packets will propagate along the direction : [ dir ] , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are random numbers .",
    "note that the above choice automatically ensures a constant surface density of photon packets , thus preventing flux anisotropies at the poles due to angle sampling ; this can be seen as follows . as we are sampling @xmath64 from a uniform distribution ,",
    "the fraction of photon packets emitted in the angular range @xmath66 is equal to [ sphotden ] dn_p(_1,_2 ) = ( r__2-r__1 ) , where @xmath67 from eq .",
    "as the area fraction of the sphere belt delimited by @xmath68 and @xmath69 is [ sphotden ] da(_1,_2 ) = 12 ( - ) one sees that the surface density @xmath70 of photon packets is constant and independent of angles .",
    "once emitted , a packet of frequency @xmath51 will travel for a finite path length of optical depth : [ eqtau ] _",
    "i()= ( ) _ k=1^i ( n_hi)_k = ( ) _ k=1^i ( n_hi)_k f x , before being absorbed in the @xmath71-th grid cell . here",
    "@xmath72 is the photoionization cross section , @xmath73 is the igm neutral hydrogen column density through the @xmath74-th cell of size @xmath75 ; the cell with @xmath76 contains the source location and it is not included in the opacity count , as its contribution is already included in @xmath77 . for simplicity , the results presented here only include h opacity ; inclusion of he , molecules ( as h@xmath6 and hd ) and heavy elements , if present , is straightforward , although computationally expensive for molecules as one has to properly compute both the line widths and their doppler shifts .",
    "the factor @xmath78 accounts for the fact that the path through a cell is in the range @xmath79 depending on its inclination .",
    "-2.truecm    to limit the computational cost , we do not attempt to calculate the actual path and we treat this effect statistically as follows . given a cubic box of unit size @xmath80 , via an independent monte carlo procedure , we randomly pick up on a face the coordinates of an entering ray and the direction of its propagation .",
    "we then derive the differential probability distribution function , @xmath81 , of the path lengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and define @xmath82 as the median value of such distribution .    the value of @xmath71 in eq .",
    "[ eqtau ] is defined as the minimum one for which the following condition is satisfied : _ i ( ) = -ln(1-r _ ) , with @xmath83 a random number .",
    "the previous relation is obtained by sampling the photon absorption probability distribution .    in each cell",
    "@xmath84 along the path from the source to the absorption site of the @xmath52-th packet , we update the value of the hydrogen ionization fraction ; @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the ionized and total hydrogen number density , respectively .",
    "this is done by advancing the time - dependent ionization equation in discretized form . at time @xmath88 it is : [ ioneq ] x_k^n+1=x_k^n+t [ _ c(x_k^n ) - _ r(x_k^n ) ] + n_(j)(n_h)_k ( x)^3 _ ki ; @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the collisional ionization and recombination rates , respectively ( cen 1992 ) ; they are evaluated at the temperature of the gas in the cell .",
    "the initial temperature is increased to @xmath91  k after absorption of a photon packet and set equal to @xmath92 , the cmb temperature , after the cell recombines ( see below ) .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , although @xmath93 could be smaller at higher redshift ( ciardi , ferrara & abel 2000 ) .",
    "the last term , describing photoionization due to photon packet absorption , is present only for the cell in which absorption takes place ( @xmath94 ) ; in the other cells along the path ( @xmath95 ) we simply follow the gas recombination . in case the derived value of @xmath96 , we set @xmath97 , and we use the extra photons to ionize the cell @xmath98 . in practice , we write @xmath99 , where the number of photons required to obtain @xmath97 is : n^(1)_(j)=\\ { ( 1 -x_k^n)-t [ _ c(x_k^n ) - _ r(x_k^n ) ] } ( n_h)_k ( x)^3 .",
    "the most delicate point of the ionization fraction evaluation is to find an appropriate expression for @xmath100 . in principle",
    ", one could update the ionization state on the entire grid after each photon packet emission .",
    "however , this is computationally too expensive .",
    "for this reason we choose to update the ionization state of cells along the packet path and we deduce @xmath100 as follows .    the cell in which the source is located is enclosed by a cubic surface ( shell ) .",
    "if we define the _ order _ of this shell to be @xmath101 , the number of its member cells is given by : n_s(g ) = ( 2g+1)^3 - ( 2g-1)^3 = 2 ( 12 g^2 + 1 )   g1 , or @xmath102 . the second order shell ( @xmath103 )",
    "is instead made of 98 cells and so on .",
    "as the photon packet directions are isotropically distributed , statistically a cell in a shell of order @xmath104 will be along a path every @xmath105^{-1}$ ] packets .",
    "therefore the typical time scale between two subsequent ionization fraction updates is @xmath106 ; this is the value we use in eq .",
    "[ ioneq ] above .",
    "the order @xmath104 is calculated as : g = _ max _ [ k_x , k_y , k_z ] , where the @xmath107 s indicate the discrete cartesian coordinates of the cell in the reference frame eq .",
    "[ frame ] .",
    "the above approximation sets a lower limit on @xmath108 , as in order to be valid it is necessary that the update time @xmath100 is shorter than the average recombination time , @xmath109 , in the box .",
    "hence to advance the simulation up to a time @xmath48 the number of packets required is : _",
    "p 24 n^2 t_s t_r , where @xmath110 is the total numer of cells in the box .",
    "this detailed treatment of recombination is important to accurately evaluate the optical depth through eq .",
    "[ eqtau ] .",
    "we then introduce an ionization vector ( size @xmath110 ) whose elements are initially set to zero .",
    "the vector element corresponding to a cell for which the ionization fraction is increased above @xmath111 as a result of an absorption event is updated to contain the value : j_r = _ int _ , where @xmath112 is the local recombination time and @xmath113 is the current simulation time .",
    "if further absorption does not take place before the time @xmath114 , we allow for recombination emission from the given cell ; if instead another absorption event takes place , we re - update the vector element to a new value of @xmath115 . as already mentioned , after recombination , the cell temperature is set at the cmb temperature at that redshift .",
    "following a cell recombination a packet is emitted along a random direction from the same location .",
    "the probability that the emitted packet has @xmath116  ev is given by the ratio between the number of recombinations to the ground level and the total one , 50% for @xmath91  k. the frequency of the re - emitted packet is determined through eq .",
    "[ nu ] , where the source sed is substituted by the volume emissivity of the diffuse radiation , given by the milne relation : @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the hydrogen ground level statistical weights ; @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the electron temperature and number density .",
    "the propagation and absorption of re - emitted packets is then followed in the same manner as for primary ones .",
    "the only difference is that the opacity contribution of the re - emitting cell is now included .",
    "the method is easily generalized to include an arbitrary number of point sources once the packet emission rates , and hence their emission sequence for the various sources are given .    -2truecm",
    "-2truecm -3truecm    the method described in the previous section has been tested against the analytical solution for the temporal evolution of the radius of an h@xmath7 region produced by a source with constant ionizing rate and expanding in an homogeneous medium ( donhaue & shull 1987 ; shapiro & giroux 1987 ) .",
    "the h@xmath7 region equivalent radius , @xmath122 , is numerically derived by first assuming that a cell @xmath74 is in the ionized state when @xmath123 . if @xmath124 is the number of ionized cells in the box , the volume occupied by the ionized region is @xmath125 and the equivalent radius is then @xmath126 .",
    "in all the tests presented here the gas density is set equal to average igm one in an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath127 at @xmath128 , @xmath129  @xmath130 ; the adopted spectrum is monochromatic , with a photon energy equal to 13.6  ev .",
    "first , we check for convergency of our scheme .",
    "we run three simulations with different values of @xmath131 .",
    "the source ionizing photon rate is @xmath132  s@xmath13 . for each run",
    "we calculate the residuals with respect to the highest resolution run @xmath133 ; they are defined as : [ eqres ] d^y = r_n^y - r_n^500 r_n^500 , where the superscript @xmath134 refers to the low- and medium - resolution runs , respectively .",

    ", this run takes only @xmath137  s ( cpu time ) on a sun ultra10/333mhz workstation .",
    "next , we assess the accuracy of the solution . in fig .",

    "the residual is about 20% ; this relatively large discrepancy occurs because the size of the ionized region is only a few cells . at later times and/or for more luminous sources the agreement is remarkably good , within a few percent .",
    "finally , we check the effects of varying the spatial resolution . to this aim we have considered runs with different box sizes , keeping a fixed linear number of cells @xmath141 . in fig .",

    "illustrative slices extracted from our simulation box through the source location are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] at different times ( 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 100 myr ) after the source has been turned on and a for larson imf , together with the initial density field .",
    "the above time interval corresponds to less than two redshift units at @xmath2 , and it is therefore not unreasonable for the purposes of this paper to neglect the igm density evolution as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the ionization front ( i - front ) breaks out from the galaxy very rapidly , leaving behind a very clumpy ionization structure in the immediate surroundings where the igm is overdense and , consequently , recombination times are shorter . as an aside , it is interesting to note that , as the circular velocity of the parent galaxy is a few km s@xmath13 , the ionized gas ( whose sound speed is of order of 10 km s@xmath13 ) will very likely be able to leave the galaxy , thus quenching further star formation .",
    "if this is a widespread phenomenon , it might have strong implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies as already outlined by some authors ( barkana & loeb 1999 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) .",
    "once the i - front expands in the igm , it is channeled  for similar reasons  by the large filaments into the underdense volumes ( voids ) and",
    "its structure becomes very complex and jagged , assuming , in a 2d representation , a characteristic butterfly shape .",
    "the typical overdensity of the clumps encountered by the expanding i - front is @xmath144 .",
    "qualitatively , the typical final extent of the ionized region is of about 1 comoving mpc ; this size is reached already after 60 myr .",
    "after that time , the rapid decrease of the source ionization power ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) slows down the expansion .",
    "the final stage of the evolution is constituted by a relic h@xmath7 region which slowly starts to recombine on a time scale which in the voids can be as long as 0.8 gyr .",
    "the mc technique shows here all his power in following the details of the i - front evolution .",
    "for example , it tracks remarkably well the channeling induced by the large scale structure : the ionization front can not propagate inside the densest filaments due to their large optical depth and short recombination time .",
    "in addition , also the effects of shadowing produced by isolated clumps are clearly recognized from the fingers protruding from the h@xmath7 region to the left of the source in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the ionization cone visible below the source , caused by a large overdensity located close to the source in that direction , is also a result of shadowing .",
    "thus it seems that our scheme is highly suitable at least for this type of cosmological radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we now turn to the differences induced by our two assumptions concerning the imf .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows a comparison between the final stages ( 100 myr after the source turn on ) of the i - front evolution for a larson ( upper panel ) and a salpeter ( bottom ) imf .",
    "the source stellar mass and other properties of the simulations are the same as those discussed above . for a salpeter imf , the volume of the ionized region is smaller by a factor 8 , although the shape is very similar to the one for a larson imf case at an earlier stage , roughly corresponding to 10 myr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this was expected from the two adopted seds .",
    "in fact , the total number of ionizing photons ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) per stellar mass formed integrated over the entire source lifetime and spectral extent is @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) for the larson ( salpeter ) imf .",
    "thus , the imf might play an important role for the reionization of the universe ; in addition , zero - metallicity stars have larger ionizing power as already stressed previously and recently addressed by other authors ( cojazzi 2000 ; tumlinson & shull 2000 ) .    to assess the differences between the evolution of an i - front propagating in an inhomogeneous medium , as in the simulations discussed here , and in an homogeneous gas at the mean igm density , we have calculated the ratio @xmath147 between the ionized volumes in our simulation and in the homogeneous case .",
    "this is found to be roughly independent of time and equal to @xmath148 for the larson imf .",
    "in the salpeter imf case @xmath149 varies slightly with time from 0.125 to 0.2 .",
    "hence , this result confirms that the ionized volume tends to be smaller in the inhomogeneous case , but suggests that the effect is not dramatic .",
