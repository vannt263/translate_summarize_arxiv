    "modelling dynamical systems with mixed phase space has been one of the main challenges of the nonlinear statistical mechanics research field and has received especial attention in the last decades @xcite .",
    "particularly , with the advance of fast computers the dynamics can be evolved over long time series letting several phenomena , some of them completely new to be observed .",
    "a class of dynamics of particular interest includes the hamiltonian systems with time - dependent perturbation , for which energy varies with time .",
    "moreover , a better understanding of the mixed dynamics in the phase space can be given , and phenomena related to them carefully characterized .",
    "the study of chaotic properties of systems can be found in many fields of physics such as fluids @xcite , plasmas @xcite , nanotubes @xcite , complex networks @xcite .",
    "interesting applications and phenomena can be found in optics @xcite and acoustic @xcite if billiard dynamics is considered .",
    "particularly , if the billiard boundaries are time dependent , applications in microwaves , @xcite and quantum dots @xcite can also be found . also ,",
    "when a particle - particle iteration in billiard dynamics is considered , one could find synchronization @xcite and soft wall effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , a phenomenon which intrigues physicists in general is the unlimited energy growth of a bouncing particle with a driven boundary , a phenomenon called fermi acceleration ( fa ) .",
    "it was introduced in earlier 1949 by enrico fermi @xcite as an attempt to describe the mechanism in which particles that have their origin from cosmic rays , acquire very high energy .",
    "nowadays his idea is extended to other models where average properties of the velocity or kinetic energy , for long time series , are studied . in light of this approach ,",
    "a billiard type dynamics is one of the most useful systems @xcite which possibly exhibits unlimited energy growth when the boundary is moving in time .",
    "the loskutov - ryabov - akinshin ( lra ) conjecture then gives the minimal conditions to observe such a phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it then claims that if a billiard has a chaotic component for the dynamics in the static boundary case , this is a sufficient condition to observe unlimited energy growth when a time - dependence on the boundary is introduced .",
    "the elliptical billiard is not described by the lra conjecture .",
    "it is indeed integrable for the static boundary case presenting a separatrix curve separating two types of dynamical regimes : libration from rotation .",
    "the introduction of time perturbation in the boundary makes the separatrix curve to turn into a stochastic layer letting the particle suffer successive crossings from rotation to libration regions @xcite leading to an unlimited diffusion in energy .",
    "recent study @xcite , indicates that non - linear phenomena like stickiness can act as a slowing mechanism of fa .",
    "in fact , the finite time trappings around the stability islands influence some transport properties , making the system locally less - chaotic @xcite . such influence of stickiness can be found in several models and applications on the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of a stadium - like billiard with oscillating circle arcs boundaries , focusing on the analysis of the mechanism that produces the decay of energy , where many low energy orbits are observed to undergo reduction of energy to an apparently stable state .",
    "we argue for existence of a critical resonance velocity where high initial velocities produce fa and low initial velocities do not experience the unlimited energy grow .",
    "such decay is caused by influence of sticky orbits with resonance around the stability islands .",
    "it leads the chaotic orbits to suffer a temporary trapping around stability islands and then be captured by the fixed points .",
    "a statistical investigation is made in order to quantify this phenomenon .",
    "similar approach was done previously @xcite , but in this paper we emphasize the decay of energy and its origin in stickiness for the first time .",
    "we also discuss the statistics of transport in the velocity axis near a resonant velocity marking a separation of low energy to high energy regimes producing the decay of energy and the phenomenon of unlimited energy growth .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] we describe the dynamics of the stadium billiard and a study of its chaotic properties .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to discuss the statistical and transport analysis of the properties for both ensembles of initial conditions considering low and high energy regime .",
    "here we also present the influence of the stickiness orbits that hold the orbits in a quasi periodic motion near the fixed points , what causes the decay of energy .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] our final remarks and conclusions are presented .",
    "this section is devoted to discuss the model and the equations describing the dynamics .",
    "the model consists of a classical particle ( or an ensemble of non - interacting particles ) moving inside a closed domain of a stadium - like shape .",
    "the stadium billiard is composed by two parallel lines connected with regions of negative curvature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the boundary of the stadium described by three geometric control parameters , @xmath0 which is the width of the circle arc , @xmath1 indicates the depth of the curvature and @xmath2 is the strength of the parallel lines . additionally , we introduce in the boundary a time dependence .",
    "the dynamics of a particle for the static version of the billiard are characterized by a constancy in the energy .",
    "however the defocusing mechanism , as proposed originally by bunimovich @xcite , is responsible to generate chaotic dynamics under the condition @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the original radius of the bunimovich stadium . according to the lra conjecture ,",
    "a chaotic dynamics is a sufficient condition to produce unlimited energy growth in the velocity of the particle when a time perturbation to the boundary is introduced .",
    "the unlimited diffusion in velocity generated due to collisions of a particle with a massive and time moving boundary is known in the literature as fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "robustness is not a characteristic of the phenomenon since inelastic collision @xcite as well as dissipation introduced by the drag - type force @xcite suppresses the unlimited diffusion .",
    "as usually made in the literature , the dynamics of the particle are made by using a nonlinear mapping .",
    "we therefore take into account two distinct possibilities of the dynamics which include : ( i ) successive collisions and ; ( ii ) indirect collisions . for case ( i ) , the particle suffers successive collisions with the same focusing component while in ( ii ) , after suffering a collision with a focusing boundary , the next collision of the particle is with the opposite focusing boundary .",
    "a schematic illustration of the both collision cases can be found in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] . in between such a collision",
    "the particle can , in principle , collide many times with the two parallel borders .",
    "we have considered that the time dependence in the boundary is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the static boundary and @xmath7 .",
    "the definition of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be found in fig .",
    "the velocity of the boundary is obtained by @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the amplitude of oscillation of the moving boundary while @xmath11 is the frequency of oscillation . in our investigation",
    "however we consider only the so called static boundary approximation ( also called as a simplified version ) .",
    "it assumes that the boundary is fixed , which makes the time spent between collisions easy to be calculated .",
    "however the velocity after collision is calculated as if the boundary were moving .",
    "for this kind of approximation , we may find some examples of dynamical systems , whose behaviour is basically the same , considering a comparison between simplified and complete version dynamics .",
    "the bouncer model and the standard map are two of the examples @xcite , and the stadium billiard itself @xcite , shows a very similar dynamics for both versions .",
    "the mapping is constructed for the variables @xmath12 corresponding to the angle between the trajectory of the particle and the normal axis at the collision point , @xmath13 is the angle measured between the normal axis at the collision points and the symmetry line of the vertical axis of the stadium , @xmath14 denotes the time and @xmath15 the outgoing speed of the particle for the nth collision .",
    "the condition to observe case ( i ) , i.e. the successive collisions , is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angle between the vertical symmetry line and the maximum angle of the negative curvature region .",
    "a typical successive collision case is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . using basic geometry properties",
    "we obtain @xmath18 where the superscript @xmath19 represents the dynamical variable immediately before the collision .",
    "case ( ii ) is considered when @xmath20 and the particle collides with the opposite focusing component . in principle , the particle can suffer several collisions with the straight walls , so for such a type of collision , we make use of the unfolding method @xcite to describe the dynamics .",
    "two auxiliary variables are then introduced , @xmath21 , which is the angle between the vertical line at the collision point and the particle s trajectory , and @xmath22 , representing the projection over the horizontal axis .",
    "a sketch of the indirect collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,        therefore leading to the following mapping @xmath23~\\\\",

    "because the collision is happening in a moving referential frame ( non inertial ) we have to make change of referential frames from inertial to non - inertial .",
    "the reflection law is then given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] are the respective restitution coefficients for the normal and the tangent components , and the superscript @xmath30 resembles the non - inertial referential frame . in this paper",
    "we consider only the conservative case , therefore @xmath31 , although the construction of the mapping is more general .    moving back to the inertial referential frame ,",
    "the components of the velocity of the particle after collision are given by @xmath32 finally the velocity of the particle after collision is given by @xmath33    the two components of the velocity can be used to obtain the angle @xmath34 , leading to @xmath35~. \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] the dynamics of the particle is then evolved by considering simultaneously equations ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "in this section we present and discuss on how the stickiness orbits influence the dynamics .",
    "moreover we proceed the study by doing an extensive statistical investigation in the dynamics particularly considering distributions of the angular variables along the dynamics .",
    "the novelty here is that after considering the histograms of frequency analysis for either the velocities and the polar angles for the decay of the velocity for a very long time series , we can see that the orbits after experience the stickiness influence , are captured by the fixed points , as if the dynamics was under the regime of dissipation .",
    "this makes the behaviour of the average velocity curves decays for lower energy ensembles . also , a transport investigation along the velocity axis considering both the low and high energy regimes in order to quantify the competition between the fa and the decay of energy near the critical resonance velocity .",
    "let us start discussing the resonance velocity .",
    "the phase space may be represented , according to the convenience , either using angular coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath36 , or the auxiliary variables @xmath21 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the projection along the horizontal axis , and is usually normalized at @xmath39 .",
    "the fixed points @xmath40 are deeply connected with @xmath12 because of the axial symmetry of the billiard .",
    "there is a sequence of fixed points corresponding to orbits always within the stadium at @xmath41 ( period-1 ) , that intersects different multiples of the parameter @xmath0 in the horizontal direction , according to the unfolding method @xcite .",
    "they are represented in the phase space by the elliptical stability islands in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . also , such stable orbits , can be understood as librator - like trajectories inside the billiard ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    considering the linearisation of the unperturbed mapping @xcite around the fixed points and according to the action - angle variables ,",
    "one finds the rotation number @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the fixed point and @xmath44 is the number of mirrored _ stadiums _ that the particle can go through in a trajectory ( for detailed explanation see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    now ,",
    "considering an orbit of a particle moving around a fixed point in the unperturbed ( static ) version of the billiard , the time spent between two successive collisions , i.e. , the time between collisions with the two focusing components is @xmath45 ( considering the period-1 fixed point ) .",
    "thus the rotation period of such an orbit around the fixed point @xmath46 .",
    "when a time perturbation is introduced in the focusing boundaries , there is an external perturbation period given by @xmath47 . when @xmath48",
    "there is then a resonance between the moving boundaries oscillations and the rotating orbits around the fixed points ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for explanation figures about this resonance ) . after grouping the terms",
    "properly one finds @xmath49    of course , that the value of @xmath50 depends on what fixed point we are evaluating the linearisation .",
    "however , for all period-1 fixed points , one may found a very close value for the resonant velocity for all of them .",
    "for the combination of the parameters as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 which is an average of all possible values for the different period-1 fixed points that one may found with the combination of the geometric control parameters given below .",
    "so , around @xmath50 , all the fixed points become resonant , and increase the mixing in the phase space . for a better understanding of the influence of these parameters on the number of islands and fixed points in the phase space and their relation with the defocusing mechanism",
    "please see ref . @xcite .",
    "also , it must be stressed that such resonance is only observed when the defocusing mechanism is no longer active @xcite , once with fully chaotic phase space , no stability island exists , therefore no resonance is observed .",
    "indeed resonance is a phenomenon often observed in dynamical systems with mixed phase space properties .",
    "when an orbit has its velocity equal or less than the resonant one , the particle can penetrate in the neighbourhood of the fixed points .",
    "it may then enter the stability island for a while and leave such a region @xcite or may be trapped in a pseudo stable orbit for a long time .",
    "such behaviour is like it was attracted by the fixed point ( we show this in the next sections ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this kind of phenomenon is related to a transformation of an invariant curve observed in the static version into a porous curve as the time perturbation is considered .",

    "[ fig5](b ) shows some curves of @xmath73 for initial velocities higher than the resonant one ( @xmath59 ) .",

    "it is important to emphasize the curves of @xmath73 do not depend on the control parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 given such parameters produce a behaviour which is scaling invariant @xcite .",

    "alternatively they were attracted to their respective attracting fixed points leading to a clear evidence that the stickiness orbits are responsible for the decay of energy for initial velocities lower than the resonant one . to make a comparison , in figs .",

    "in fact the region in @xmath34 concerning the chaotic sea shows a growth in the histogram of frequency indicating a high chaotic behaviour therefore corroborating for the fa phenomenon .    after a careful look at histogram of frequency",
    "we see some islands are more preferred than others .",

    "[ fig5](a ) the decay of energy of the curves of @xmath73 produce several different plateaus of convergence for long time which of course depend on the initial velocity .",

    "one can notice that the several peaks are not observed anymore .",
    "now we have a very well defined distribution along the velocities meaning that for the very high energy ensemble , as for example the initial velocities at least ten times larger than @xmath50 , fa is inherent in the system .",
    "only very few orbits lead to a decay in energy , as shown in the green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) for @xmath93 .",

    "you could find different resonance velocities , for different islands of different periods , but even so the period-1 islands should be the more influential ones .",
    "still , one thing that might change the preference between the islands , would be change the value of the geometric control parameters .",
    "this change , would influence on the number of islands , and also change the resonance velocity .",

    "the same procedure applies for initial conditions in the high energy regime .",
    "so if it decays to a velocity smaller than @xmath50 we consider it has escaped from high energy to lower energy region .",
    "we emphasize the multiple crossings from same orbit can in principle happen so we are considering just the first crossing with @xmath50 line , up to the maximum collision of @xmath82 .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows a grid of initial conditions selected near the critical region leading to  escape \" in a color scheme .",
    "figures [ fig8](a , b , c , d ) then represent in the color scale the respective collision ( in a log scale ) where an initial condition has crossed the critical resonance velocity line for the first time .",

    "the fraction of initial conditions of @xmath80 in figs.[fig8](a , b ) is : @xmath95 escaped and decreased their velocity up to the end of simulations ; @xmath96 escaped and experienced fa and the @xmath97 never crossed the critical line of resonance velocity .",
    "these results indicates that the great majority of initial conditions for @xmath80 stays in the high energy regime .",
    "considering now the fraction of initial conditions of @xmath94 given by figs.[fig8](c , d ) we found that : @xmath98 of the initial conditions who had escaped stays in the low energy regime up to the end of simulations , @xmath99 escaped and had experienced fa in the end of the simulations , and @xmath100 never escaped .",
    "these results mean that for the initial conditions of @xmath94 , about @xmath101 of the orbits stay confined in the lower energy regime . in particular , for all items of fig.[fig8 ] , one can see a strong stickiness regime in the last two islands , which are the islands of main influence for the convergence of orbits , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "this strong stickiness indicates that these orbits were trapped for really long times around that regions , and crossed the critical resonance line in a very later time , or not even crossed it , which can be an evidence that they were captured by the fixed points , what will lead their velocity down .",
    "we revisited the problem of the time - dependent stadium - like billiard aiming to understand and quantify the mechanism that is responsible for the decay of energy .",
    "a non - linear mapping was constructed considering distinct kinds of collisions with the boundary to describe the dynamics . a resonance between the period of oscillation of the boundary and the rotation period around the fixed point was confirmed . through this resonance",
    "two ensemble regimes can be defined at low and high energy , where for high velocities fa is inherent .",
    "a statistical and transport investigation along the phase space was made concerning both regimes of initial energy as an attempt to describe the competition between the decay of energy and fa .",
    "we characterize the fundamental role of stickiness and initial conditions for the existence of fermi acceleration .",
    "focusing on the lower energy regime , we have seen that stickiness orbits lead the velocity to decay , and for long time the dynamics is stable where most of the orbits are located very close to the fixed points , where it seems that they were captured by fixed points , as if the dynamics was under the influence of dissipation and then suppressing the velocity .",
    "the results give support to new studies on stickiness influence in the fa and diffusion process concerning systems with mixed properties in the phase space .",
    "also , it would be interesting to investigate , if stickiness should play similar role in other billiards and chaotic systems .",
