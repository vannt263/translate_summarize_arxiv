    "in semiconductor nanostructures , the regime of strong correlation is reached when the electronic density becomes low enough so that the coulomb repulsion becomes dominant with respect to the kinetic energy of the electrons . from the purely fundamental point of view , the study of the strongly - interacting limit in such systems is interesting since charge localization , reminiscent of the wigner crystallization @xcite of the bulk electron gas , is expected to occur at low densities .",
    "a lot of previous theoretical work on wigner localization in nanostructures has focused on finite - sized quantum dots ( see , for example , refs . ) , and the crossover from liquid to localized states in the transport properties of the nanostructure has been addressed .",
    "@xcite in quasi one - dimensional nanosystems , signatures of wigner localization were observed experimentally in one - dimensional cleaved - edge overgrowth structures , @xcite or in the transport properties of insb nanowire quantum - dot systems .",
    "@xcite more recent experimental work clearly identified the formation of wigner molecules in a one - dimensional quantum dot that was capacitively coupled to an atomic force microscope probe .",
    "@xcite wigner localization has also been investigated in other 1d systems such as carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite ( for a review , see ref . ) .",
    "finally , regarding practical applications , wigner - localized systems have been shown to be potentially useful,_e.g .",
    "_ , for quantum - computing purposes.@xcite    when trying to model electronic strongly - correlated systems , however , the commonly employed methodologies encounter serious difficulties of different nature . on the one hand , the configuration interaction ( ci ) approach , despite being in principle capable of describing any correlation regime , is in practice limited to the study of small systems with only very few particles due to its high computational cost , which scales exponentially with the number of particles , @xmath0 .",
    "such numerical difficulties get even worse in the very strongly - correlated limit due to the degeneracy of the different quantum states and the consequent need of considering larger hilbert spaces in the calculations .",
    "other wave - function methods like quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite which rely to some extent on various approximations , can treat systems larger than the ci approach , but are still computationally expensive and limited to @xmath1 .    the much cheaper kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft),@xcite which allows to treat thousands of electrons , is the method of choice to treat larger quantum systems",
    ". however , all the currently available approximations for the exchange - correlation functional fail to describe the strongly - correlated regime@xcite even at the qualitative level . allowing spin- and spatial - symmetry breaking may yield reasonable total energies , without , however , capturing the physics of charge localization in non - magnetic systems .",
    "moreover , broken symmetry solutions often yield a wrong characterization of various properties and the rigorous ks dft framework is partially lost ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  ) .",
    "ks dft is , in principle , an exact theory that should be able to yield the exact energy and density even in the case of strong electronic correlation , without artificially breaking any symmetry .",
    "however , when dealing with practical ks dft , one could expect that the non - interacting reference system introduced by kohn and sham might not be the best choice when trying to address systems in which the electron - electron interactions play a dominant role .",
    "for many years , huge efforts have been made in order to try to get a better characterization and understanding of the properties of the exact kohn - sham reference system ( see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "all these works reflected the large difficulties encountered when trying to obtain adequate approximations to describe strong correlation in the exact ks theory.@xcite    an alternative density - functional framework , based on the study of the strongly - interacting limit of the hohenberg - kohn density functional , was presented in ref .  .",
    "in this approach , a reference system with infinite correlation between the electrons was considered instead of the non - interacting one of kohn and sham .",
    "the two formalisms can therefore be seen as complementary to each other and , indeed , the first results obtained with this so - called _ strictly - correlated - electrons _ ( sce ) dft , presently limited to either 1d or spherically - symmetric systems , showed its ability to describe systems in the extreme strongly - correlated regime with a much better accuracy than standard ks dft.@xcite on the downside , however , sce dft requires that one knows _ a priori _ that the system is in the strong - interaction regime , and it fails as soon as the fermionic nature of the electrons plays a significant role .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the formalism lacks some of the appealing properties of the kohn - sham approach , such as its capability to predict ( at least in principle ) exact ionization energies .",
    "also , crucial concepts widely employed in solid state physics and in chemistry , such as the kohn - sham orbitals and orbital energies , are totally absent in sce dft .",
    "very recently , a new approach that combines the advantages of the ks and the sce dft formalisms , consisting in approximating the kohn - sham exchange - correlation energy functional with the strong - interaction limit of the hohenberg - kohn energy density functional , has been proposed.@xcite pilot tests of this new `` ks sce '' framework showed that it is able to capture the features of both the weakly and the strongly - correlated regimes in semiconductor quantum wires , as well as the so - called @xmath2 crossover occurring in between them , while keeping ( at least for 1d systems ) a computational cost comparable to the one of standard ks dft with the local - density approximation ( lda ) . in other words , the sce functional yields a highly non - local approximation for the exchange - correlation energy functional , which is able to capture key features of strong correlation within the ks scheme , without any artificial symmetry breaking .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to further investigate this new ks sce method , by discussing its exact formal properties and , for the prototypical case of ( quasi)-1d quantum wires , by also performing full ci calculations to compare electronic densities , total energies and one - electron removal energies in different regimes of correlation .",
    "we find that the ks sce results are qualitatively right at all correlation regimes , representing an important advance for ks dft .",
    "however , while one - electron removal energies are quite accurate , total energies and ground - state densities are still quantitatively not always satisfactory , and therefore we also discuss the construction of corrections to ks sce . in particular , we investigate here a simple local correction , which , however , turns out to give rather disappointing results , suggesting that to further improve ks sce we need semi - local or fully non - local density functionals .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next sec .",

    "one can see that each of the @xmath0 peaks in the density corresponds to a minimum in the ks potential , which is separated from the neighboring ones by barriers or `` bumps '' , at whose maxima the ks potential has a discontinuous ( but finite@xcite ) first derivative .",
