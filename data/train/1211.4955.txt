    "<S> the fragmentation of a projectile nucleus in high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions is described remarkably well by a simple model that assumes the projectile fragment produced in the pf reaction to be a mere `` spectator '' of the projectile nucleus ; as a spectator , this fragment survives frequent nucleon - nucleon interactions , and the other nucleons ( `` participants '' ) are abraded off through the reaction  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , the projectile fragment acquires an angular momentum ( in other words , a nuclear spin ) , whose orientation is determined simply as a function of the momentum of the outgoing fragment . although the spin orientation may practically be reduced due to cascade @xmath4 decays following the fragmentation , we assume that a significant amount of spin orientation survives in the fragment . here </S>",
    "<S> the degrees of spin orientation of rank one and two , in particular , are referred to as _ spin polarization _ and _ spin alignment _ , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> one advantage of this method of orienting the fragment spin is that the resulting spin orientation does not depend on the chemical or atomic properties of the ri . </S>",
    "<S> however , the method also shows a drawback in the sense that the spin orientation thus produced in the pf reaction tends to be partially or completely attenuated since the fragmentation generally involves the removal of a large number of nucleons from the projectile . </S>",

    "<S> accordingly , there has been high demand for a new technique for preventing the attenuation in spin orientation caused by large differences in mass between the projectile and the fragment . in this paper , we present a method for producing highly spin - aligned ri beams by employing a two - step pf process in combination with the momentum - dispersion matching technique .     </S>",

    "<S> the most basic scheme employs the configuration in ( a ) , in which a nucleus of interest is directly produced from a primary beam through a single occurrence of the pf ( a single - step pf reaction ) . as stated earlier </S>",
    "<S> , this scheme suffers from the drawback that the degree of spin alignment tends to be attenuated when the pf involves the removal of a large number of nucleons from the projectile . with the aim to overcome this problem , configuration ( b ) adopts a two - step pf reaction , where a beam of nuclei produced in the first pf reaction ( secondary beam ) is used to obtain a beam of the nuclide of interest through a second pf reaction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , using a slit installed at a momentum - dispersive focal plane , the particles forming the secondary beam are chosen to be of a nuclide containing one proton or neutron more than the nuclide of interest . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the target ri beam is produced via a pf reaction in which only one proton or neutron is removed . for the ri beam obtained with this scheme </S>",
    "<S> , the spin alignment is expected to be high due to the simplicity of the reaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a significant increase in the total production yield is suggested by experiments  @xcite in in - beam @xmath4-ray spectroscopy . in the scheme presented above , </S>",
    "<S> however , the production yield is typically reduced by a factor of @xmath171/1000 because the production of target nuclei requires the successive occurrence of two highly particular reactions .    a hint on how to eliminate the disadvantage of the scheme in ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> emerged from the recognition that the quantity that determines the spin alignment is solely the momentum change @xmath15 in the process of fragmentation that produces the nuclei of interest , and that the spin alignment is not sensitive to the momentum of the incident nucleus . in scheme ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 is selected with the aid of two momentum slits , the first of which is used to select the momentum of the secondary beam and the second slit determines the outgoing momentum of the secondary pf . the tremendous and unnecessary drop in yield </S>",
    "<S> is avoided by discarding the two - fold selection and introducing a single direct selection of the target @xmath15 itself . </S>",
    "<S> this is realized by placing a secondary target in the momentum - dispersive focal plane and a slit in the double - achromatic focal plane , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_2step ]  ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of realizing maximum spectral resolution in momentum loss by compensating for the beam momentum spread of the incident beam , as executed here , is known as _ dispersion matching _ in ion optics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the important point of this technique is that the reaction products that acquire equal amounts of momentum change upon the second fragmentation are focused onto a single physical location . </S>",
    "<S> the application of this technique to pf - induced spin alignment can prevent the cancellation of opposite signs of spin alignment caused by momentum spread , which secondary beams unavoidably undergo .    </S>",
    "<S> the validity of scheme ( c ) was first tested with the in - flight superconducting ri separator bigrips  @xcite at the riken ribf facility  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath14al was produced by a pf reaction of a 345-mev / nucleon @xmath12ca beam on a @xmath18be target with a thickness of 1.85 g/@xmath19 , chosen to provide a maximum production yield for the secondary @xmath14al beam . </S>",
    "<S> a wedge - shaped aluminium degrader with a mean thickness of 4.05  g/@xmath19 was placed at the first momentum - dispersive focal plane f1 , where the momentum acceptance at f1 was @xmath203% . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary @xmath14al beam was introduced to a second wedge - shaped aluminium target with a mean thickness of 2.70  g/@xmath19 , placed at the second momentum - dispersive focal plane f5 . the @xmath0al nuclei ( including those in isomeric state @xmath21al ) </S>",
    "<S> were produced through a pf reaction involving the removal of one neutron from @xmath14al . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the secondary target was chosen such that the energy loss from the target was comparable with the theoretical estimate for the width of the momentum distribution  @xcite for single - nucleon removal . in the present case , @xmath22  mev/@xmath23 , and the momentum width for @xmath0al was measured to be @xmath24  mev/@xmath23 or 0.4% . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0al beam was subsequently transported to focal plane f7 whereby the momentum dispersion between f5 to f7 was tuned to be with the same magnitude and opposite sign as that from f0 to f5 ( momentum matching ) , effectively canceling out the momentum dispersion from the site of the first pf reaction to f7 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that an admixture of @xmath0al particles in the @xmath14al secondary beam was found to be negligibly small , due to the difference in the magnetic rigidity . </S>",
