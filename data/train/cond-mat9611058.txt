    "strongly correlated electron systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years in view of mechanisms for high-@xmath1 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model arises in various contexts and represents one of the most fundamental systems .",
    "the model describes the nearest - neighbor hopping of electrons with spin - exchange interaction .",
    "the effect of a strong repulsive on - site coulomb interaction is modeled by the restriction of the hilbert space to states without doubly occupied lattice sites .",
    "the one - dimensional hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where the projector ensures that double occupancies of sites are forbidden . at the supersymmetric point",
    "@xmath3 the system was shown to be integrable @xcite by the well - known bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the ground state and excitation spectrum were investigated @xcite and critical exponents calculated by finite - size scaling and conformal field theory studies @xcite . here",
    "we will discuss the model at finite temperatures .    according to the seminal work @xcite thermodynamical properties of general integrable systems",
    "are described by an infinite set of coupled integral equations reflecting the existence of infinitely many different rapidity patterns . for the @xmath0 model",
    "such integral equations were formulated in @xcite .",
    "the method consists of a direct evaluation of the partition function by taking into account all excited states of the hamiltonian .",
    "the excitations are derived on the basis of the so - called string conjecture which describes the solutions to the bethe ansatz equations ( for details see @xcite ) . in the evaluation of finite - size quantities at zero temperature",
    "the validity of the string conjecture is controversial @xcite .",
    "sometimes , a simplistic application is known to lead to erroneous results @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the string approach to thermodynamics apparently yields exact equations .",
    "( see for instance @xcite where the traditional thermodynamics of the quantum @xmath4 chains were recovered by an independent approach utilizing the fusion hierarchy analysis . ) for a nice illustration of the successes of the traditional approach to thermodynamic properties the reader is referred to the review @xcite on the kondo problem .    the general problem to be faced within the traditional string approach to thermodynamics is often the necessity to deal with infinitely many integral equations . in view of practical computations",
    "this requires a truncation scheme which is difficult to control .",
    "also , and more fundamentally , the calculation of quantities other than the free energy , for instance correlation lengths at finite temperature , is not possible in the traditional approach .",
    "our approach takes a different route to overcome these problems .",
    "quite generally , @xmath5-dimensional quantum systems at finite temperatures can be mapped onto classical systems on @xmath6-dimensional inhomogeneous lattices by a trotter - suzuki mapping @xcite .",
    "we therefore employ a convenient mapping to a two - dimensional classical model .",
    "the classical system corresponding to the integrable @xmath0 chain @xcite is the perk - schultz model @xcite which is a well - known multi - component generalization of the six - vertex model .",
    "the interesting thermodynamical quantities are expressed by eigenvalues of an appropriately defined operator , the so - called quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) .",
    "the largest eigenvalue , as usual , directly yields the free energy .",
    "the further knowledge of the next - largest eigenvalues provides the correlation lengths .",
    "this represents the important advantage @xcite compared to the traditional thermodynamical bethe ansatz requiring all eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition to our general strategy we will incorporate another important ingredient .",
    "the most common structure of solvable models is the existence of a family of commuting matrices comprising the physical operator ( hamiltonian or transfer matrix ) .",
    "we therefore utilize a mapping to a classical system where the qtm is apparently embedded in such a family .",
    "while the general trotter arguments respect the first conserved quantity only , our choice implies the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities .",
    "this assures the integrability of the qtm from the very beginning .",
    "the new approach has been applied to several quantum systems @xcite which essentially reduce to scalar field theories . in particular",
    "a finite set of integral equations has been derived for the spin @xmath7 heisenberg chain and related models in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of these equations is the compact formulation originating from the very closely related calculation of finite - size eigenvalues of transfer matrices @xcite .",
    "the investigations of highly correlated electron systems , such as the hubbard model , have just started in @xcite along the novel strategy .",
    "here we adopt the most sophisticated method @xcite .",
    "the qtm is of the  staggered \" type and is labeled by two spectral parameters .",
    "the dependence on the first parameter leads to the commuting family and thereby playing an essential role in the diagonalization procedure .",
    "the second parameter , on the other side , intertwines the finite temperature system with the finite - size geometry of the underlying lattice .",
    "this spectral parameter represents a spatial anisotropy of boltzmann weights in the two - dimensional model .",
    "thus our procedure can be regarded as a finite temperature extension of the usual hamiltonian limit .",
    "however , we must be careful in taking the limit to obtain finite temperature properties : a fine tuning between the parameter and the system size is necessary .",
    "this is the price to pay for dealing with non - vanishing temperatures .",
    "we will overcome the last problem by adopting the method developed in the finite - size correction problem @xcite .",
    "all information of the bethe ansatz equations will be transformed into _",
    "finitely many _ coupled nonlinear integral equations , valid for any system sizes .",
    "the trotter limit then can be taken analytically .",
    "the resultant equations yield the exact thermodynamical properties of the model .",
    "the study of the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 model using the qtm method has been introduced in a short letter @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a more comprehensive analytical investigation of this system .",
    "this work constitutes the first approach allowing for analytical and high precision numerical treatments of a multicomponent luttinger liquid .",
    "in fact , we confirm the general luttinger liquid picture of interacting fermions analytically in the low - temperature limit . furthermore , in this limit our equations reduce to _ linear _ integral equations thus making direct contact with the dressed energy formalism for the groundstate investigation of the hamiltonian @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "immediately seen from their equation ( 2.26 ) , the dressed energy functions for spinon ( @xmath154 ) and holon ( @xmath155 ) satisfy the same integral equations ( [ ( j4 ) ] ) except that the right - hand side should be replaced by .",
    "therefore , we have the connecting relations @xmath156 within the @xmath130 approximation .",
    "now that we want to evaluate @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 including all @xmath160 corrections we can replace and in the denominators of ( [ ( j.7 ) ] ) by and , respectively .",
    "moreover , we find that our @xmath44 functions are proportional to bulk density functions of spinons and holons : . to this end compare equation ( [ ( j5 ) ] ) with ( 2.20 ) in @xcite .",
    "hence the integrands of the first two terms in equation ( [ ( j.7 ) ] ) are products of bare energy functions times bulk density functions .",
    "therefore , they give `` bulk '' ( or zero temperature ) contributions , as expected .",
    "the remaining terms , which represent finite temperature contributions , can be neatly written down by adopting the expressions for the sound velocities of the elementary excitations in the dressed energy approach .",
    "namely , let the sound velocities be @xmath161 ( with @xmath162 ) then the @xmath163 terms in the free energy read @xmath164 we thus observe various consistency relations .",
    "the free energy obeys the prediction by conformal invariance and luttinger liquid theory for arbitrary filling .",
    "the sound velocities coincide with those obtained from the dressed energy calculations .",
    "we remark that there should be some subtleties in treating the model for vanishing external fields in the same approximation scheme , while the original non - linear integral equations are valid for all cases .",
    "even for the linear integral equations obtained in this section analytic solutions can not be found for general filling .",
    "therefore , one has to resort to numerical treatments",
    ". here however , we restrict ourselves to the already presented numerical results for the original nonlinear integral equations which are not limited to the low - temperature regime .",
    "we have derived eigenvalue equations for the quantum transfer matrix of the @xmath0 model .",
    "this approach permits the _",
    "exact _ analytical as well as numerical calculation of thermodynamical quantities .",
    "instead of solving an infinite set of integral equations  as is necessary in the traditional thermodynamical bethe ansatz  we have to solve integral equations for only _ two _ functions ( in the case of vanishing magnetic field ) .",
    "we have considered analytically certain low- and high - temperature limits verifying the values predicted by conformal field theory . moreover ,",
    "the case of intermediate temperatures was treated numerically . as shown ,",
    "the specific heat and compressibility display an interesting behavior in dependence on particle density and temperature .",
    "also , the reduction to the heisenberg model in the limit of ` half - filling ' has been proved in a straightforward way .",
    "a direct relation has been established to the dressed energy formulation concerning the groundstate properties .",
    "this has been easily achieved by a linearization scheme in the vicinity of the `` fermi surface '' .",
    "let us emphasize again the advantage of the novel method .",
    "in the traditional approach one has to deal with infinitely many coupled integral equations . except for special cases ,",
    "the set of equations defies further analysis because of its complexity .",
    "indeed , it was almost 20 years after the derivation of equations @xcite that the numerical calculation has been done for several thermodynamic quantities of the hubbard model @xcite . still , the explicit calculation allowed for only 2 ( ! ) bound charge rapidities and 15 - 30 spin rapidities , while the original equations contain @xmath165 rapidities . although it was claimed that such truncation works for very low temperatures , it might be rather inaccurate at finite temperatures unless the coulomb interaction takes very large values .    our treatment , on the other hand , deals with only two integral equations which clearly is advantageous in practical calculations",
    ". in view of this",
    ", the presented work might be considered as the first approach yielding explicit and concrete results for a lattice system with interacting spin-1/2 fermions _",
    "at all temperatures_.",
    "we actually performed numerical computations over a wide range of densities and temperatures .",
    "the results are of high accuracy ( @xmath166 ) in the entire range of parameters .",
    "the application of the present approach is not limited to the study of 1d quantum chain problems but also to those of deformed conformal field theories . at the moment",
    "the main tool in this field is the so - called tba method which originates from the traditional string approach .",
    "as remarked by several authors @xcite , the novel approach is an efficient alternative for scalar models ( the sine - gordon model , spin @xmath7 heisenberg chain ) .",
    "the necessity of a generalization of this method to the multicomponent case ( luttinger liquid ) has been stated as an important problem in @xcite . this program has been carried out in the present paper .",
    "it was shown explicitly for the @xmath0 model .",
    "the success of our approach is certainly not accidental , i.e. the applicability is not model dependent , but rather universal as shown by the general embedding of the qtm into a commuting family of matrices .",
    "we expect to report in the near future further research on other models , e.g. on a generalized hubbard model @xcite , as well as on additional thermodynamical quantities such as correlation lengths .",
