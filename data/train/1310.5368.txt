    "diffractive processes contribute a significant fraction to the total inelastic proton - proton cross sections at high energies .",
    "these reactions can be described in terms of the exchange of a @xmath3 , a hypothetical object with the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "the experimental signatures of diffractive events are the presence of non - exponentially suppressed large rapidity gaps and/or presence of the intact leading protons .",
    "diffractive events with a hard parton - parton scattering , so called _ hard diffractive events _ , subject of these proceedings , are of particular interest since they can be studied in terms of perturbative qcd .    the measurements presented here are based on the data collected by the cms experiment during 2010 at a @xmath47 tev .",
    "the detailed description of the cms experiment can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the simulation of non - diffractive events is obtained with pythia6  @xcite and pythia8  @xcite .",
    "hard diffractive events are simulated with the pompyt  @xcite and pomwig  @xcite generators , as well as pythia8 , these generators are used with diffractive pdfs ( dpdfs ) from the same fit to diffractive deep inelastic scattering data , h1 fit b.",
    "dijet events were selected by requiring 2 jets with @xmath520 gev and -4.4@xmath64.4 . the anti-@xmath7 clustering algorithm with the radius parameter @xmath8=0.5",
    "was used to reconstruct jets . to enhance the diffractive contribution ,",
    "the requirements @xmath93 ( @xmath10 - 3 ) were enforced , where @xmath11 is the pseudorapidity of the most forward ( backward ) particle - flow ( pf )  @xcite object , combining measurement from the tracker and the calorimeters .",
    "this selection translates to imposing a rapidity gap of at least 1.9 units in the hadron calorimeter ( hf ) ( with the coverage 3.0@xmath125.0 ) .",
    "figure [ diff - dijet](a ) shows the effect of this selection , the @xmath13 requirement rejects events at high @xmath2 values , whereas region of low @xmath2 dominated by the diffractive contribution is not affected .",
    "the results are compared to mc predictions where the relative diffractive contribution was scaled by a factor of 0.23 obtained by minimizing the difference between @xmath2 distributions of the data and sum of non - diffractive and diffractive models .",
    "the diffractive cross section as a function of @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ diff - dijet](b ) .",
    "the low @xmath2 bin shows significant contribution from diffractive dijet production , observed for the first time at the lhc  @xcite . the associated _ rapidity gap survival _",
    "probability is estimated to be in the range from     distributions with ( open symbols ) and without ( closed symbols ) the @xmath9 3 requirement , compared to mc predictions ; ( b ) the differential cross section for inclusive dijet production as a function of @xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]   distributions with ( open symbols ) and without ( closed symbols ) the @xmath9 3 requirement , compared to mc predictions ; ( b ) the differential cross section for inclusive dijet production as a function of @xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.08@xmath140.04 ( nlo ) to 0.12@xmath140.05(lo ) by comparing measured cross section and predictions from the leading order ( pompyt and pomwig ) and next - to - leading order ( powheg )  @xcite diffractive generators based on dpdfs from the hera experiments .",
    "the identification of w and z events is based on the presence of isolated electrons and muons with high transverse momentum .",
    "electron ( muon ) candidates are required to have @xmath151.4 and @xmath525 gev , while events with a second isolated electron or muon with @xmath510 gev are rejected , missing transverse momentum is required to be greater than 30 gev and the transverse mass of the charged lepton and the neutrino to be greater than 60 gev ; similarly for z candidates leptons were required to have @xmath525 gev and @xmath161.4 with the reconstructed invariant mass of the dilepton system restricted between 60 and 120 gev .",
    "this selection results in essentially background - free w and z event samples .",
    "[ diff - w](a ) shows charged particle multiplicity for w events ( electron and muon channels combined ) with a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) signature , enforced by requiring that none of the calorimeter towers had a measured energy of more than 4 gev in at least one of the hf calorimeters , which corresponds to a pseudorapidity interval of 1.9 units .",
    "the data are compared with the predictions of pythia6 and pythia8 .",
    "events with zero energy deposition manifest the presence of a pseudorapidity gap extending over hf .",
    "however large discrepancies between the data and different models are observed .",
    "the percentage of w and z events with lrg signature is ( 1.46@xmath140.09(stat.)@xmath140.38(syst.))% and ( 1.57@xmath140.25(stat.)@xmath140.42(syst.))% .",
    "a large asymmetry is observed between the number of events with the charged lepton from w decay in the opposite and with the same hemisphere as the rapidity gap , in accordance with the predictions of pompyt diffractive mc , see fig .",
    "[ diff - w](b ) . in comparison ,",
    "the various non - diffractive mc predictions predict a symmetric distribution , see pythia curves on fig .",
    "[ diff - w](b ) .",
    "the diffractive component is estimated to be ( 50@xmath149.3(stat.)@xmath145.2(syst.))% by fitting the observed asymmetry with the admixture of pompyt and non - diffractive ( pythia ) events .",
    "this presents first evidence for diffractive w production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of 15th international conference on elastic & diffractive scattering for warm hospitality and for an exciting conference .",
