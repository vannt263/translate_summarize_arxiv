    "a new system for precise measurements of magnetic field integrals and multipole components of different types of insertion devices ( ids ) is created as an upgrade of the magnetic measurement facility at the aps @xcite .",
    "the main reasons for upgrading the existing system were :    * to increase accuracy and reproducibility of acquired data .",
    "long cables between motor drives and stepper motors in the existing system produce an excessive noise interfering with the measured signal .",
    "integrators in the existing system take 4 data values per coil turn .",
    "the new system uses @xmath0 data points of coil signal for analysis , leading to better accuracy .",
    "different error sources presented in the coil signal can be analyzed , particularly coil vibrations . * to simplify the system and increase reliability for ease of maintenance , future developments , and possible duplication of the system in other projects . in the existing system vme , euro , as well as non - standard crates , have been used .",
    "it has been very hard to maintain and almost impossible to reproduce the system . * to allow integration of the results of the magnetic measurements with other aps databases and utilities .",
    "the linux os instead of windows has to be used in order to reuse software modules developed by operations analysis group @xcite for the aps storage ring . * to provide more convenient data analysis in both stand - alone and network operation . * to add more features , such as a translation mode , for measuring multipole magnetic field components .",
    "the stretched coil is used to measure magnetic field integrals .",
    "the coil signal is proportional to the time derivative of the magnetic flux through the coil crosssection .",
    "the measurements are performed at constant coil rotation ( translation ) speed .",
    "there are four different options for measurements .    * integrals * and * rotation * modes .",
    "signals are measured for full turns of the coil .",
    "two turns [ clockwise ( cw ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) ] are performed to exclude systematic errors .",
    "the measured data are applied to calculate absolute values of the first or the second ( if the coil is twisted by 180@xmath1 @xcite ) magnetic field integrals .",
    "a set of approximately ten points across the gap of the i d is measured to calculate multipole magnetic moments .",
    "* translation * mode .",
    "the linear motion of the coil to measure the magnetic flux changing in the horizontal or vertical direction is examinated , allowing significant reduction in the measurement time of the multipole moments .    *",
    "variable field * mode .",
    "the coil does not move .",
    "this mode is designed for measurements of ids with switching electromagnets  @xcite .",
    "a block diagram of the new system is shown in fig .  [ layout ] .        eight smart motors from animatics corp .",
    "@xcite are used .",
    "each servomotor has an encoder , a motor drive , and a motor controller  all integrated in one unit , thus reducing the level of the electrical noise , compared to the existing system .",
    "these smart motors have two standard serial ports  rs-232 and rs-485 .",
    "all motors connected in parallel to the rs-485 communication line are controlled by the pentium iii computer under linux os through a rs-232/rs-485 converter .",
    "the stretched coil conventional configuration with parallel wires is being used for measurements of the first field integrals and multipole components .",
    "the measured signal is amplified by a scxi-1120 national instruments amplifier .",
    "the gain is set to 2000 , and the bandwidth is set to 10  khz .",
    "a 500 khz data acquisition board pd2-mfs-500/16 from united electronics industries @xcite is used to measure the amplified signal . the linux driver for this pci daq board",
    "was provided by the manufacturer .",
    "a new multipoles & integrals  software system ( miss ) has been written .",
    "it consists of two parts : a tcl / tk script and a shared c - library .",
    "the tcl / tk script describes a user interface and data processing and uses a shared c - library for hardware access .",
    "the script language includes all embedded instruments to create the user - friendly interface and to use a shared c - libraries . besides , miss uses utilities developed by the aps computer support group for this language .",
    "miss operates under linux and provides the user interface through the set of windows and worksheets ( see fig .",
    "[ chartflow ] ) .",
    "figures  [ motion ]  and  [ integrals ] demonstrate examples of the user interface .          the hardware is accessed from the script through a shared c - library .",
    "this library consists of two command sets ",
    "one for smart motors and another for the daq board .",
    "the serial port driver `` ttys '' with appropriate setting of the structure `` termios '' is used to control the motors .",
    "the linux driver `` pwrdaq '' is used to control the daq board .",
    "some of the daq board commands are based on the corresponding c - functions of this driver .",
    "the complex procedures providing synchronization between coil motion and data acquisition are included in the c - library .",
    "these procedures combine calls to the motors and the daq board in the required sequence .",
    "so , the execution of such commands can not be interrupted by a tcl / tk script command .",
    "this process includes two steps .",
    "* integrals * and * rotation * modes . at the first step , the choice of coil `` trajectory '' ( velocity and acceleration of the rotation ) determines the calculated delay between initiating the coil motion and starting the data acquisition .",
    "the second step includes matching the additional delay to achieve agreement between the signals measured for cw and ccw coil turns .",
    "this matching is based on the assumption that plots of measured signals ( voltage versus the coil s turn angle @xmath2 ) for both of these rotations must be mirror symmetric , if delays are chosen correctly .",
    "figure  [ synchronization ] shows the measured signals for both cases after integration and subtraction of offsets .",
    "it was found that the additional delay is equal to 25  ms for a calculated delay of 550  ms .",
    "[ htbp ]      * translation * mode .",
    "the first step is identical to the first step in the rotation mode .",
    "the additional delay was determined by using the rotation mode with the same velocity and acceleration of the smart motors .",
    "this delay is equal to 35  ms for a calculated delay of 1500  ms .",
    "different algorithms are used to obtain the magnetic properties of the ids .      1 .",
    "fitting of the functions @xmath3 on noisy coil signals for cw ( @xmath4 ) and ccw coil ( @xmath5 ) turns .",
    "2 .   calculating of magnetic field integrals @xmath6 for each coil turn from fitting parameters @xmath7 .",
    "3 .   repetition of previous steps to improve accuracy and define rms errors of measurements .              1 .   fitting of the polynomials @xmath12 of the power @xmath13 on noisy signals for a few coil passes across the gap of",
    "averaging of obtained coefficients @xmath17 over the set of coil passes to reduce the statistical errors .",
    "note , that the translation mode saves significant time in measuring the integrated multipole moments in comparison with the rotation mode .",
