    "the enumeration of self - avoiding walks ( saw ) and polygons ( sap ) on a lattice by their number of steps @xcite is a long standing problem in combinatorics .",
    "extrapolation of series data from exact enumeration has led to high precision estimates of the exponential growth rate and subexponential corrections but an exact solution of either problem ( i.e. finding the generating function , see below ) seems out of reach .",
    "rechnitzer @xcite has shown that the anisotropic generating function of saps on the square lattice is not d - finite .",
    "a ( possibly multivariate ) function @xmath0 is _ d - finite _ , if the vector space over @xmath1 spanned by its derivatives is finite dimensional . in the univariate case",
    "this means that @xmath2 is a solution of a homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation with polynomial coefficients . at present",
    "one tries to find solvable subclasses with large exponential growth rates .",
    "this approach is particularly successful in two dimensions .",
    "we will restrict to the square lattice in our paper .    one promising class",
    "are so - called _ prudent walks _ ( pw ) @xcite , which are saws never stepping towards an already occupied vertex . note",
    "that a general prudent walk is not _ reversible _ , i.e. the walk traversed backwards from its terminal vertex to its initial vertex may not be prudent .",
    "since saws are counted modulo translation , we may choose the initial vertex of a pw to be the origin @xmath3 the full problem of pw is unsolved , but recently bousquet - mlou @xcite succeeded in enumerating a substantial subclass .",
    "we adopt the terminology of her paper and use the same methods to obtain the generating functions for the corresponding polygon models defined below . every nearest neighbour walk on the square lattice",
    "has a minimal bounding rectangle containing it , referred to as the _ box _ of the walk .",
    "it is easy to see that each unit step of a prudent walk ends on the boundary of its current box .",
    "( this is _ not _ a characterisation of pws , e.g. the walk @xmath4 is not prudent . )",
    "this property allows the definition of the following subclasses .",
    "call a pw _ one - sided _",
    ", if every step ends on the _ top _ side and _ two - sided _",
    ", if every step ends on _ top _ or on the _ right _ side of the current box .",
    "similarly , a pw is referred to as _ three - sided _ if every step ends on the _ left _ , _ top _ or the _ right _ side of the current box and additionally each _ left step _ and each _ right step _ that ends on the _ bottom side _ of the current box _",
    "inflates _ the box . +",
    "* remark . * _ i ) _ as soon as the width of the box of a pw is greater than one , the latter additional condition is redundant .",
    "it rules out certain configurations which can occur only if the box width is equal to one , namely ",
    "downward zig - zags \" of width one , e.g. @xmath5 which needlessly complicate the computations below .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ duchi @xcite introduced two - sided and three - sided pws as _",
    "type-1 _ and _ type-2 _ pws , respectively . in @xcite",
    "the authors also employ her notation .",
    "explicit expressions for the generating functions of one- , two- and three - sided pws have been found so far confirming the data obtained in @xcite by computer enumeration .",
    "the first class consists of partially directed walks and has a rational generating function .",
    "the second class was shown to have an algebraic generating function by duchi @xcite and recently in @xcite the third class was solved and the generating function was found not to be d - finite .",
    "guttmann @xcite proposed to study the polygon version of the problem , meaning walks , whose last vertex is adjacent to the starting vertex .",
    "we exclude single edges from this definition . as above , the property of being prudent demands a starting vertex and a terminal vertex .",
    "so prudent polygons are _ rooted _ polygons with a directed root edge .",
    "note further that a prudent polygon ( pp ) which ends , say , to the right of the origin ( i.e. in the vertex @xmath6 ) may never step right of the line @xmath7 and furthermore if the walk hits that line it has to head directly to the vertex @xmath8 so prudent polygons are _ directed _ in the sense that they contain a corner of their box .",
    "moreover , a @xmath9-sided pp can be interpreted as a @xmath10-sided pw confined in a half - plane , see also section [ conclusion ] . in this paper",
    "we deal with the polygon versions of the two - sided and three - sided walks , referred to as two - sided and three - sided pps .",
    "enumeration of one - sided pps is trivial , since these are simply rows of unit cells .",
    "we give explicit expressions for the half - perimeter generating functions of two - sided pps and three - sided pps and show that the latter is not d - finite , as expected on numerical grounds @xcite . to our knowledge three - sided pps are the first _ exactly solved _ polygon model with a non - d - finite _ half - perimeter _ generating function .",
    "enumeration of the full class of pps remains an open problem , as for the walk case .",
    "* outline : * in section [ functionalequations ] we give functional equations for the generating functions which are based on decompositions of the classes in question , in section [ solution ] we solve those by the kernel method @xcite and in section [ analyticproperties ] we study the analytic behaviour of the generating functions of two - sided and three - sided prudent polygons .",
    "section [ random ] is dedicated to the random generation of pps .",
    "in combinatorial enumeration of objects from a class @xmath11 ( say pps ) with respect to counting parameters @xmath12 ( say perimeter , area etc . ) the ( multivariate ) power series @xmath13 is called the _ generating function _ of @xmath14 in the following we will count prudent polygons by half - perimeter and other , so - called _ catalytic counting parameters_. the variables in the generating function marking the latter are called _ catalytic variables_. their introduction allows us to translate certain combinatorial decompositions into non - trivial functional equations for the associated generating functions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we identify a pp ( a  closed \" pw ) with the collection of unit cells it encloses and build larger pps from smaller ones by attaching unit cells in a prudent fashion , i.e. the new boundary walk with the same initial vertex remains prudent .",
    "a two - sided prudent polygon either ends at the vertex above the origin or at the vertex to the right of it .",
    "this partitions two - sided pps into two subsets , which can be transferred into each other by the reflection in the diagonal @xmath15 so it suffices to enumerate prudent polygons ending on the top of their box . here",
    "two cases occur , namely the  degenerate \" case when the first steps of the walk are left .",
    "the resulting pp is simply a row of unit cells pointing to the left .",
    "these have a half - perimeter generating function @xmath16 in the  generic case \" such a pp is a bar graph turned upside down , i.e. a column convex polyomino containing the top side of its bounding box , cf .",

    "here @xmath20 is the catalytic variable .",
    "the width parameter is not a catalytic parameter .",
    "however , it will be important in the study of three - sided pps .",
    "we follow the lines of @xcite .",
    "the generating function @xmath17 of bar graphs satisfies the functional equation @xmath21    a bar graph is either a single column , or it is obtained by attaching a new column to the right side of a bar graph .",
    "the decomposition is sketched in figure [ feq2sd ] .",
    "single columns of height @xmath22 contribute @xmath23 to the generating function .",
    "the polygons obtained by adding a column which is shorter than or equal to the old rightmost column contribute the second summand .",
    "this is seen as follows .",
    "a polygon of half - perimeter @xmath24 width @xmath9 and rightmost column height @xmath25 contributing @xmath26 to @xmath17 gives rise to @xmath25 polygons whose rightmost column is shorter or equal .",
    "their contribution sums up to @xmath27 summing this over all polygons gives the second summand .",
    "the third summand corresponds to adding a larger column . to this end",
    "duplicate the rightmost column and attach a non - empty column below the so obtained new rightmost column .",
    "a so obtained bar graph can be viewed as an ordered pair of a bar graph and a column .",
    "the generating function of those pairs is the third summand of the rhs .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "the walk constituting the boundary of a three - sided pp has @xmath28 as its initial vertex and @xmath6 or @xmath29 or @xmath30 as its terminal vertex .",
    "those walks with terminal vertex @xmath30 may not step above the line @xmath31 and they have to move directly to the vertex @xmath30 as soon as they step upon that line .",
    "this leads to two sorts of bar graphs either rooted on their left or on their right side , see figure [ 3sdtop ] .",
    "are bar graphs , width=226,height=10 ]    so only those three - sided pps are of further interest , which end in @xmath6 or @xmath32 both classes are transformed into each other by a reflection in the line @xmath33 we study those ending to the right of the origin in the vertex @xmath8 again a degenerate and a generic case are distinguished , according to whether such a pp reaches its terminal vertex from below via the vertex @xmath34 (  counterclockwise around the origin \" ) or from above , via the vertex @xmath35 (  clockwise \" ) . in the degenerate case",
    "we simply obtain a single column .",
    "in the generic case , a ( possibly empty ) sequence of initial down steps is followed by a left step .",
    "so denote by @xmath36 the generating function of the generic three - sided pps ending in the vertex @xmath6 counted by half - perimeter , the length of the top row and the distance of the top left corner of the top row and the top left corner of the box , marked by @xmath18 @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , cf .",

    "the decomposition we use is sketched in figure [ 3sdfeq ] .",
    "the polygons in question contain the top right corner of their box .",
    "this corner is some point @xmath41 if @xmath42 then the pp is either the unit square containing @xmath28 and @xmath35 or a bar graph as above with that unit square glued to the right .",
    "this yields the first summand .",
    "a pp with @xmath43 is obtained in one of the following three ways from a pp with top right corner @xmath44 the first is to add a new row on top , which is shorter than or equal to the original top row .",
    "a similar computation as in ( with some additional book keeping on @xmath20 ) yields the second summand . the second way to obtain a larger pp from a smaller",
    "one is by adding a new row on top , which is longer than the original top row , but does not inflate the box to the left . again a treatment similar to the computation in yields the third summand .",
    "the third way to extend a pp is to add a row on top of length equal to the width of the box plus one and possibly an arbitrary bar graph .",
    "this finally yields the fourth summand and the functional equation is complete .    *",
    "remark . * as in the case of general saps @xcite we can define a concatenation of two three - sided pps .",
    "roughly speaking , the one pp can be enlargened by inserting the other one at the top corner of the leftmost column , see figure [ concatenation ] .",

    "the converse inequality holds for prudent walks , since breaking an @xmath50 step pw after @xmath51 steps leaves one with a pair of prudent walks of respective lengths @xmath51 and @xmath52 we now turn to unrestricted pps .",
