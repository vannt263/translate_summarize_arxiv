    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) has received considerable interest from both academia and industry in recent years , which is regarded as a key technique in the fifth generation ( 5 g ) of cellular wireless communication systems @xcite .",
    "owing to the deployment of a large number of antennas at the base station ( bs ) side , massive mimo systems are expected to increase the energy and spectral efficiency significantly even with simple linear signal processing @xcite .",
    "these advantages are mainly harvested by serving tens of active user terminals ( uts ) on the same time - frequency resource simultaneously with spatially directional narrow beams formed by the bs s massive antenna array , which leads to a high power gain for each ut and a high multiplexing gain for the entire system . moreover ,",
    "the energy - focusing effect provided by narrow beams can also improve the physical layer security @xcite .",
    "most of the previous researches on the massive mimo downlink have been focused on the case where the bs transmits individual information to different uts , which is also known as broadcast channel or multi - user downlink transmission .",
    "besides , it is also of great interest and plays an important role in cellular systems , where the bs broadcasts the same common information to multiple uts simultaneously .",
    "this is also known as multicasting in some literature .",
    "a typical scenario is that the bs broadcasts the common control signaling to activate a `` sleeping '' ut or delivers popular audio / video data to a group of subscription uts .",
    "wireless common information broadcasting has also been included in the third generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) long - term evolution ( lte ) standards known as evolved multimedia broadcast multicast service ( embms ) @xcite .    note that common information broadcasting has been investigated in many previous studies . according to whether the bs utilizes the channel state information ( csi ) or",
    "not , the approaches for common information broadcasting can be divided into two categories : closed - loop and open - loop . for closed - loop approaches , it is typically assumed that the instantaneous or statistic csi between the bs and the uts is known at the bs side . then by exploiting the csi",
    ", the bs determines the corresponding transmission strategy , e.g. , choosing the optimal precoding matrix to maximize the worst - case receiving signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite . for open - loop approaches",
    ", the bs does not utilize any csi and needs to broadcast the common information blindly regardless of the uts .",
    "a typical open - loop approach is to use space - time block codes ( stbcs ) , e.g. , the alamouti code ( ac ) which is suitable for two transmit antennas @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the open - loop approach .",
    "we restrict our concern to stbc transmissions in massive mimo systems for common information broadcasting .",
    "one of the major concerns about stbc transmissions is instantaneous csi acquisition at the receiver side , with which the transmitted codeword can be decoded coherently .",
    "a typical method is to send pilots at the transmitter side for channel estimation at the receiver side . to obtain a meaningful estimation value ,",
    "the length of the pilots should not be less than the number of transmit antennas . in a massive mimo downlink where the bs ( transmitter ) has a large number of antennas",
    ", too many time - frequency resources would have to be spent on the pilots , hence lowering the net spectral efficiency to a great extent . to address this problem ,",
    "the idea of confining the transmitted signal to lie in a low - dimensional subspace to reduce the pilot overhead was independently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered the independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "channel and proposed to repeat a low - dimensional signal across bs antennas to reduce the pilot overhead .",
    "the transmitted signal in this scheme will be spatially selective . for practical spatially correlated channels , the transmitted signal should be spatially omnidirectional , i.e. , having equal radiation power in each spatial direction .",
    "such that the ut in any spatial direction can obtain a fair receiving snr .",
    "besides omnidirectional transmission , it is also important for the transmitted signal to have equal power on each antenna to sufficiently utilize all the power amplifier ( pa ) capacities of the bs . in @xcite",
    ", we proposed to map a low - dimensional signal to the high - dimensional antenna array of the bs through a channel - independent precoding matrix to reduce the pilot overhead .",
    "the precoding matrix is specially designed to satisfy the above two power constraints statistically in a long time period . in this paper , the same with @xcite , we consider more strict power constraints where the transmission power is constant across spatial directions and transmit antennas at _ any instant time _",
    "( not just in the statistics sense ) , and then design the precoding matrix and the signal constellation in the low - dimensional stbc jointly to satisfy the constraints .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is presented in section ii , including the channel model and the framework of precoding based stbc transmission . in section iii , two basic requirements that the stbc should satisfy are demonstrated . in section iv , a systematic approach to design such an stbc and the corresponding diversity performance analysis are presented . in section v , several detailed examples of the stbc are designed .",
    "numerical results are presented in section vi .",

    "can hence be well approximated by the asymptotic result , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "this approximation has been shown to be accurate enough with a practical value of the number of antennas which usually ranges from @xmath41 to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath43 as the basic channel model to simplify our analysis and designs . in simulations , we will still use the non - asymptotic model ( [ channel model 1 ] ) to generate the channel covariance matrix to evaluate the performance for our designs .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality , these @xmath26 uts are assumed to experience the same large - scale fading , i.e. , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "consider stbc transmission for common information broadcasting .",
    "assume that the common information , which can be regarded as a group of binary bits , is mapped to an stbc matrix @xmath46 .",
    "this codeword matrix is then transmitted from the @xmath5 antennas of the bs within @xmath47 time slots .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath28th ut follows @xmath48 = { \\bf{h}}_k^h{\\bf{s } } + [ { z_{k,1}},{z_{k,2 } } , \\ldots , { z_{k , t}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the channel @xmath49 is assumed to keep constant within these @xmath47 time slots , and @xmath50 for @xmath51 denotes the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .    with signal model ( [ system model 1 ] ) , to coherently decode the transmitted codeword @xmath52 , the instantaneous csi @xmath53 with dimension @xmath5 must be known at the ut side . when utilizing training based downlink channel estimation , the length of the downlink pilots should not be less than @xmath5 . in a massive mimo system where the number of bs antennas @xmath5 is large , many time - frequency resources would have to be spent on the pilots .",
    "this will lower the net spectral efficiency to a large extent .    in order to reduce the pilot overhead ,",
    "we propose that the high - dimensional stbc is composed by a precoding matrix and a low - dimensional stbc .",
    "correspondingly , we can write ( [ system model 1 ] ) as @xmath54 } = { { \\bf{h}}_k^h}{\\bf{w}}{{\\bf{x } } } + { [ z_{k,1 } , z_{k,2},\\ldots , z_{k , t } ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a tall precoding matrix since @xmath56 is selected to be less than @xmath5 , and @xmath57 is a low - dimensional stbc . with ( [ system model 2 ] ) , the ut does not need to estimate the actual channel @xmath53 , but only requires to estimate the effective channel @xmath58 , and then decodes the codeword @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the length of the downlink pilots can be reduced to @xmath56 , which is the dimension of @xmath58 .",
    "as long as @xmath56 is selected to be sufficiently small , the pilot overhead can also be reduced to small enough .",
    "note that the main purpose of using the precoding matrix in ( [ system model 2 ] ) is different from those in @xcite , where the precoding matrices depend on either the instantaneous csi or the statistical csi , and are used to improve the performance with spatially directional signaling .",
    "however , the precoding matrix here is channel - independent and mainly used to ease channel estimation .",
    "signal model ( [ system model 2 ] ) is the basic framework in this paper . in what follows",
    ", we will mainly discuss how to design the precoding matrix @xmath60 and the low - dimensional stbc @xmath59 , for common information broadcasting , and in the meantime , satisfying the requirements on power efficiency and diversity performance .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath61 and @xmath62 to normalize the total average transmission power at the bs side . before proceeding",
    ", we will discuss the basic requirements that the stbc should satisfy in the next section .",
    "in signal model ( [ system model 2 ] ) , letting @xmath63 represent the @xmath64th column of @xmath59 , we can denote @xmath65 as the transmitted signal vector from the @xmath5 antennas of the bs at time slot @xmath64 .",
    "then , @xmath66 is the received signal at the @xmath28th ut without awgn .",
    "hence , the power of the received signal can be expressed as @xmath67 . for common information broadcasting",
    ", it is expected that the bs can provide equal receiving power for all the uts , hence all the uts can have fair quality - of - services ( qos ) . in mathematical expressions , it is expected that @xmath67 is constant regardless of @xmath68 .",
    "unfortunately , this will be impossible by only designing @xmath69 and @xmath70 when @xmath71 is unknown at the bs side .",
    "one reasonable method is to average over the fast fading of @xmath71 . with ( [ channel model 2 ] ) ,",
    "the received power after this averaging can hence be expressed as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the covariance matrix of the effective channel @xmath74 . however , without knowing @xmath39 in ( [ average receiving power ] ) , it is still impossible to let @xmath75 be constant regardless of @xmath76 by only designing @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we restrict our concern to the case that all the @xmath26 uts have the same large - scale fading with respect to the bs , i.e. , letting the diagonal matrix @xmath77 for @xmath78 where @xmath79",
    ". then we have the following lemma .",
    "_ lemma 2 : _ for any diagonal matrix @xmath80 , the average receiving power @xmath81 is constant if and only if all the @xmath5 elements in @xmath82 have the same amplitude .    for notational simplicity ,",

    "this verifies the sufficiency .",
    "then we prove the necessity .",
    "if all the @xmath5 elements in @xmath15 do not have the same amplitude , at least two of them do not have the same amplitude .",
    "without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath90 .",
    "for both of the following two diagonal matrices @xmath91 and @xmath92 belonging to @xmath93 , it can be shown that @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "hence @xmath96 since @xmath90 .",
    "this verifies the necessity .",
    "the @xmath5 elements of @xmath82 can be seen as the transmitted signals in @xmath5 discrete spatial directions , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the squared absolute values of these @xmath5 elements represent the transmission power in @xmath5 discrete spatial directions , respectively .",
    "hence , all the @xmath5 elements in @xmath82 having the same squared absolute value , i.e. , the same amplitude , means that the transmitted signal has equal power in all discrete spatial directions , i.e. , radiating omnidirectionally .",
    "then we have the following requirement .",
    "_ requirement 1 : _ to have omnidirectional transmission , all the @xmath5 elements in @xmath82 should have the same amplitude , where @xmath97 is the transmitted signal vector from the @xmath5 transmit antennas at time slot @xmath64 .",
    "besides omnidirectional transmission , the pa utilization efficiency at transmit antennas also needs to be considered . in practice",
    ", each transmit antenna has its own pa in its analog front - end , and is limited individually by the linearity of the pa .",
    "therefore , the transmission power on each antenna can not exceed a maximum value for that antenna .",
    "we assume that the maximum power value on each antenna is equal to each other .",
    "this is reasonable when all the antennas employ the same pa hardware .",
    "let @xmath98}_m$ ] denote the transmitted signal on the @xmath14th antenna at time slot @xmath64 . per - antenna",
    "power constraint means that @xmath99 for @xmath85 and any @xmath64 , where @xmath100 denotes the maximum allowable power on each antenna . at the same time , to utilize the maximum pa capacity of bs antennas , all these @xmath5 antennas need to transmit with the maximum power @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath102 , we can always multiply each @xmath103 with a constant scalar @xmath104 without causing any distortion to the signal",
    ". then all the @xmath5 antennas have transmission power @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , we have the following requirement .",
    "_ requirement 2 : _ to have equal power on each transmit antenna to sufficiently utilize all the pa capacities of bs antennas , all the @xmath5 elements in @xmath97 should have the same amplitude .",
    "note that in this paper , equal instantaneous power across spatial directions and transmit antennas is considered , i.e. , at each time slot @xmath64 , the instantaneous transmission power keeps constant for all the spatial directions and all the transmit antennas . in our previous paper @xcite , equal average power across spatial directions and transmit antennas",
    "is considered , i.e. , in a long time period , the average transmission power keeps constant for all the spatial directions and all the transmit antennas , where the average is taken over the information symbols in the low - dimensional stbc @xmath59 in ( [ system model 2 ] ) .",
    "the average power just depends on the precoding matrix @xmath106 since the information symbols have been averaged out , while the instantaneous power depends on both the precoding matrix @xmath60 and the information symbols in the low - dimensional stbc @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that a much more strict power constraint is considered in this paper .",
    "therefore , the signal constellation in the low - dimensional stbc needs to be jointly designed with the precoding matrix to satisfy the above two requirements , while any existing low - dimensional stbc can be directly employed in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we propose a systematic approach to design stbcs satisfying requirements 12 in section iii , and then analyze the diversity performance for the stbcs designed with the proposed approach .",
    "first , some useful mathematical results are presented to help the stbc design .",
    "we refer to a sequence of length @xmath5 as a constant - amplitude zero auto - correlation ( cazac ) sequence if all the @xmath5 elements of this sequence have the same amplitude , and at the same time , all the @xmath5 elements of the @xmath5-point dft of this sequence have the same amplitude .",

    "furthermore , it is shown in @xcite that the zc sequence has perfect periodic auto - correlation whether @xmath5 is even or odd , i.e. , @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the kronecker delta function and @xmath113 for @xmath114 denotes the cyclic shifting matrix .",
    "since the periodic auto - correlation function of @xmath115 is a kronecker delta function , with the fact that periodic auto - correlation function and power spectrum function are dft pairs , the power spectrum function of @xmath110 , denoted by an @xmath6 column vector @xmath116 , will have @xmath5 identical elements due to the dft of a kronecker delta function .",
    "therefore , all the @xmath5 elements of @xmath117 have the same amplitude whether @xmath5 is even or odd .    based on the zc sequence , we introduce the following lemma which will be used latter .    _ lemma 3 : _ consider that @xmath56 is an integer and @xmath5 is an integer multiple of @xmath118 .",

    "then the transmitted signals on the @xmath5 transmit antennas over @xmath47 time slots are given by @xmath133 where the last equation is with @xmath134 .",
    "letting @xmath135 denote the @xmath64th column of @xmath126 , the transmitted signal vector on the @xmath5 transmit antennas at time slot @xmath64 is given by @xmath136 for @xmath51 .",
    "lemma 3 reveals that if and only if all the @xmath56 elements in @xmath137 have the same amplitude , requirements 12 can be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "therefore , with the precoding matrix in ( [ general precoding matrix ] ) , the remaining work is to design the unitary matrix @xmath131 therein and the low - dimensional stbc @xmath59 to let each column @xmath137 of @xmath138 have constant amplitude . in section",
    "v , we let @xmath59 be some existing classic stbcs , e.g. , the ac , and then design the unitary matrix @xmath131 and the constellations for the information symbols in @xmath59 .      one may treat @xmath139 together as an stbc , where @xmath60 is a precoding matrix independent of information symbols once it was designed , while @xmath59 includes information symbols . when @xmath139 is designed with the proposed approach , with requirement 1 , we know that it can guarantee equal receiving power at different uts .",
    "however , the diversity performance of this stbc at these uts is still not clear . in this subsection ,",
    "we use pairwise error probability ( pep ) @xcite to evaluate the diversity performance for our stbc in common information broadcasting .",
    "consider that there are @xmath26 uts in the cell , and the signal model is as ( [ system model 2 ] ) .",

    "in this section , we design some detailed examples for the stbc by utilizing the approach proposed in the previous section .      we first consider a simple case with @xmath183 in ( [ system model 2 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the precoding matrix @xmath55 and the stbc @xmath184 in ( [ system model 2 ] ) degenerate to a column vector @xmath185 and a scalar symbol @xmath186 , respectively .",

    "it is not hard to see that the psk constellations of @xmath202 and @xmath203 used in this paper has the same minimum euclidean distance with that of the joint design proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath202 and @xmath203 are modulated independently in this paper while they are modulated jointly in @xcite , they can be decoded separately in this paper while they must be decoded jointly in @xcite . therefore",
    ", the proposed design in this paper has the same coding gain with the joint design in @xcite while the decoding complexity can be reduced .",
    "since the maximum achievable diversity order of ac is only @xmath198 , if a higher diversity order is desired , we need to consider the stbc @xmath217 in ( [ system model 2 ] ) with a larger size @xcite .",
    "one option is to use orthogonal stbcs ( ostbcs ) @xcite .",
    "these codes , including the @xmath216 ac as a special case , achieve full diversity and have symbol - wise ml decoding at the receiver side . here , we consider the following well - known ostbc with symbol rate of @xmath218 , @xcite , @xmath219 we have to design the precoding matrix @xmath220 and the constellations of the three information symbols @xmath221 in @xmath222 to let @xmath223 satisfy requirements 12 simultaneously ,",
    "i.e. , all the @xmath5 elements in each column of @xmath224 as well as all the @xmath5 elements in each column of @xmath225 have the same amplitude .    from ( [ ostbc ] )",
    ", one can see that there are zero entries in the codeword matrix @xmath226 , while others are information symbols @xmath227 .",
    "this means that the signal power on the four virtual transmit ports using @xmath226 in ( [ ostbc ] ) will be different no matter how one designs a constellation for @xmath227 .",
    "therefore the identity precoding matrix @xmath228 may not be used directly as what is done with @xmath229 in ( [ precoded alamouti code precoding matrix ] ) for the ac . as an alternative method",
    ", the precoding matrix here is proposed to be @xmath230 where @xmath115 is defined in ( [ zc sequence ] ) and @xmath231 is the @xmath216 unitary hadamard matrix .",
    "one can see that , multiplying the ostbc matrix @xmath226 in ( [ ostbc ] ) with the precoding matrix @xmath232 in ( [ precoded ostbc precoding matrix ] ) is just to repeat @xmath233 periodically across transmit antennas , and then adjust the phases via zc sequence @xmath110 on each antenna .",
    "the difference between the codeword matrix ( [ ostbc after precoding ] ) after precoding and the codeword matrix ( [ ostbc ] ) before precoding is that , there is no zero entry in ( [ ostbc after precoding ] ) any more and this leads to the possibility to have constant power across transmit antennas by designing the constellations for information symbols @xmath227 properly .",
    "let the number of bs antennas @xmath5 be an integer multiple of @xmath234 . with lemma 3 , we know that requirements 12 can be satisfied simultaneously if and only if all the four elements in each column of @xmath235 in ( [ ostbc after precoding ] ) have the same amplitude .",
    "readily , we conclude that the three information symbols @xmath221 in ( [ ostbc after precoding ] ) should satisfy latexmath:[\\ ] ] hence , if and only if @xmath449 have the same amplitude , which is equivalent to @xmath450 having the same amplitude , @xmath451 will have the same amplitude since @xmath452 have the same amplitude . therefore , all the @xmath5 elements in the @xmath5-point dft of @xmath121 have the same amplitude if and only if @xmath450 have the same amplitude .",
