    "chandra is the first x - ray imaging satellite to have an image quality that is comparable to that of optical images .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the high resolution mirror assembly ( hrma ) has half - power diameter ( hpd ) of about one - half arcsecond ( chandra observatory guide ) , which corresponds to @xmath1 m on the focal plane .",
    "the detector system should oversample the psf in order to achieve the highest imaging capability .",
    "chandra has two types of non - dispersive detector systems : the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , a ccd array , and the high resolution camera ( hrc ) , a micro - channel plate .",
    "the ccd chip employed in the acis is a frame - transfer device with @xmath1 m square pixels ( burke et al .",
    "1997 ) and moderate energy resolution .",
    "the overall psf of the chandra / acis image is a convolution of the psf of the hrma and the pixel shape of the ccd . because the pixel size of the ccd is comparable to the hpd of the hrma ,",
    "the image quality is somewhat degraded .",
    "the hrc has higher spatial resolution ( @xmath4 m fwhm , with @xmath5 m pixels ) , but with poor energy resolution .",
    "the observer therefore needs to choose the detector system depending on the required combination of angular resolution and energy resolution .",
    "because the ccd pixel boundaries are sharply delineated by physical structures on the detector , we can utilize the morphology of x - ray events that split charge between pixels to provide detector position information on a size scale much smaller than the actual pixel size . in  [ sec : charge ] , we explain the process of charge generation and division within the ccd pixel . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , we describe our method for subpixel resolution . in  [ sec : results ] , we apply this method to chandra / acis data for six point sources , and show that the method does indeed recover the inherent angular resolution of the hrma , although at the price of reduced observing efficiency .",
    "the process of detection of x - rays in a ccd has been discussed in detail by lumb & nousek ( 1993 ) and by townsley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . here",
    "we provide an abbreviated discussion of these processes sufficient to explain our method for subpixel resolution .",
    "a ccd is ordinarily used in photon - counting mode to detect x - rays . to make this possible",
    ", the count rate must be low enough ( and the exposure short enough ) so that at most one photon is detected per frame in any given 3 x 3 `` neighborhood '' of pixels .",
    "when an x - ray photon enters the ccd , it is captured by photoelectric absorption , and generates a primary charge cloud in which the number of electrons is proportional to the incident x - ray energy .",
    "an x - ray photon of 1kev , for example , generates about 275 electrons , while an optical photon generates only one or two electrons .",
    "figure [ schematic ] schematically shows the evolution of a primary charge cloud generated by x - ray photons inside the ccd .",
    "the primary charge cloud expands through diffusion as it travels through the depletion region of the ccd to the buried channel , where the charge is collected into pixel structures defined by electric fields near the surface of the ccd . before being captured into the photon entrance pixel",
    ", the primary charge cloud generated by an x - ray photon absorbed near the back of the depletion region can spread into neighboring pixels , creating a split - pixel event .",
    "by contrast , an x - ray photon absorbed in or near the buried channel will typically deposit its charge in a single pixel , and the resulting charge packet is referred to as a ` single pixel event ' .",
    "the incident x - ray energy is estimated by summing up the signal contained inside the event . because the output from each pixel contains noise , single - pixel events usually have a better energy resolution than do split pixel events .",
    "the size of the primary charge cloud depends on the travel distance in the depletion layer and the electric field inside the ccd .",
    "if the ccd is front - illuminated ( fi ) , the travel distance in the depletion region depends on where the photoabsorption occurs , and therefore depends strongly on the photon energy .",
    "the shorter the attenuation length for an x - ray photon , the smaller the primary charge cloud will be .",
    "the x - ray photons used in our analysis are mainly around 1kev ( near the peak effective area of the instrument ) , and have a relatively short attenuation length in silicon compared with the depletion depth or the pixel size of the ccd .",
    "therefore , they are photoabsorbed in a relatively shallow region of the depletion layer . on the contrary , if the ccd is back - illuminated ( bi ) , a 1 kev photon is absorbed near the back surface ; the travel distance will be the depth of the depletion layer , and is almost independent of the x - ray energy . applying a simple diffusion model",
    ", the primary charge cloud size will be a few @xmath6 m for the bi ccd and smaller for the fi ccd .",
    "this explains qualitatively why objects observed with the fi ccd show a higher fraction of single - pixel events in the branching ratio than those observed with the bi ccd .",
    "the spreading of the charge cloud is less than typical ccd pixel sizes , and x - ray events may contain charge in more than one adjacent pixel in excess of the local bias level and/or dark current , with most true x - ray events ( as opposed to particle - induced background events ) containing no more than four adjacent pixels .",
    "x - ray events are classified by their morphology , with two common systems being the 8 grades used by the asca satellite ( grades 0@xmath77 ) and the 256 grades used by the acis instrument ( fltgrades 0@xmath7255 ) .",
    "further details regarding asca grades are given in yamashita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) while  6.4 of the chandra proposers observatory guide ( 2000 ) describes acis fltgrade .",
    "because the primary charge cloud generated inside the ccd expands through diffusion , the position on the ccd where the x - ray entered can be precisely determined if the center of gravity of this charge cloud can be measured . if the primary charge cloud remains within a single pixel ( a single pixel event ) , its centroid can not be determined , and one generally assumes that the x - ray photon landed in the center of that pixel , with an uncertainty of about 1/2 pixel . however ,",
    "if an x - ray photon is absorbed near a pixel boundary , the primary charge cloud splits into the adjacent pixel(s ) , forming a split - pixel event , and the centroid of the charge distribution can be used to precisely locate , in at least one dimension , the position at which the photon was absorbed .",
    "the charge cloud size determines the size of the boundary region within which the x - ray photon becomes a split event .",
    "the pixel is therefore divided into three classes of regions that characterize single - pixel events ( from the center of the pixel ) , two - pixel split events ( from the pixel edges ) and three- or four - pixel split events ( from the pixel corners ) .",
    "the ratios among the areas for these three regions can be roughly estimated from the branching ratio of these x - ray event grades .",
    "this technique has been verified by our mesh experiments ( tsunemi , yoshita , & kitamoto 1997 ; tsunemi et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these experiments",
    ", we placed a metal mesh with many small periodically - spaced holes just above the ccd .",
    "such a setup enables us to directly measure the primary charge cloud shape ( hiraga et al .",
    "we thus found that the charge cloud shape is well expressed by a gaussian function with a standard deviation ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath9kev photons of about @xmath10 m ( tsunemi et al .",
    "although the charge cloud shape depends on the ccd chip , the charge cloud size for an x - ray photon with energy of a few kev is at most a few @xmath6 m .",
    "knowledge of the grade of an event , combined with the relatively narrow size of the charge cloud , allows the position at which the x - ray enters the ccd to be determined with subpixel resolution ( hiraga , tsunemi , & miyata 2001 ) .",
    "based on these results , we can safely estimate the primary charge cloud size generated by an x - ray photons with energy of a few kev inside the acis ccd chip to be a few @xmath6 m .",
    "the mesh experiment applied to the acis ccd shows that split events are generated very near to the pixel boundary ( pivovaroff et al .",
    "the grade information of the x - ray event will thus specify the entering position within the pixel to high accuracy for x - rays absorbed near the pixel boundaries .",
    "for single - pixel events , the photon can only be localized to a region slightly smaller than the pixel size .",
    "the two - pixel split events can be identified only with a pixel edge , which provides high resolution in one dimension .",
    "the greatest improvement for the x - ray position resolution is achieved for three- or four - pixel split events ( corner events ) , which are generated when the x - ray enters the ccd very close to a pixel corner .",
    "the x - ray entering position must be within one charge cloud size from the pixel corner .",
    "this allows us to improve on the spatial resolution of the pixel size by roughly a factor of ten , based solely on the event grade .",
    "this is of practical use for data obtained by chandra because , unlike the hst , which points very accurately at a fixed position during observations , chandra is intentionally moved slowly across the sky during each observation .",
    "this ` dithering ' motion of the observatory moves the target image across the ccd surface , forming a lissajous figure with an amplitude of about 20 pixels and a period of about 1000 sec .",
    "therefore , x - rays from a point source do not always enter the same subpixel position of the same pixel , but have randomly distributed subpixel positions .",
    "some photons enter the central part of the pixel , forming single - pixel events , while others enter the pixel boundary , forming split pixel events .",
    "the latter can be used to achieve higher spatial resolution than that determined by the pixel size .",
    "strictly speaking , the image shape can vary according to the dithering motion . with taking into account the amplitude of the dithering motion ,",
    "the degradation of the image quality concerned is negligibly small compared to the actual psf of the hrma .",
    "the method we employ is quite simple .",
    "first , we discard all x - ray events except for corner events ( acis fltgrades 10 , 11 , 18 , 22 , 72 , 80 , 104 , and 208 ) . we know that these remaining events entered the detector near a pixel corner , but were projected onto the sky as if they had entered at the pixel center .",
    "we therefore need to shift the sky coordinates for these events by 1/2 pixel along each axis in _ detector _ coordinates . to do this , we need to know the orientation of the ccd chip projected onto the sky coordinates .",
    "this is given by the roll angle of the spacecraft , which is specified in the header keyword of the event file .",
    "we then can shift the position for corner events by half the pixel size ( which is @xmath11 ) along both pixel sides .",
    "the actual shift direction depends on the ccd chip employed and the roll angle as well as the fltgrade of the event .",
    "the resulting sky positions accurately reflect the actual incident positions on the ccd detector to within about @xmath12 for perfect attitude knowledge .",
    "to test this method , we searched our gto data and publicly available calibration data for point - like sources with appropriate characteristics .",
    "we selected sources with good statistics ( at least 1500 total counts ) and that are close to the optical axis ( within 75@xmath13 ) in order to avoid possible distortion .",
    "we selected six point - like sources ; two stars and four agns .",
    "the two stars , which we refer to as source 1  ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and source 2  ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , are in the orion nebula .",
    "two agns , pks0312@xmath7770  and pg1634 + 706 , come from the public data .",
    "the other source contains the two gravitationally lensed images of the quasar q0957 + 561 , named image a  and image b  ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) .",
    "three sources are observed with the front - illuminated ( fi ) ccd while the others are observed with the back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "we removed the subpixel randomization usually applied in the standard data processing at the chandra x - ray center so that we can assess the precise x - ray entering position on the detector .",
    "townsley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) developed a cti correction method that could correct the ` grade migration ' ( the corruption of event grades caused by poor charge transfer efficiency in the fi ccds ) for the data obtained after 1999 september 16 .",
    "we applied their method to five data sets out of six , since it could not cover the data for pks0312@xmath7770 .",
    "the observational configurations are summarized in table  [ table : summary ] .",
    "we then sorted all the x - ray events ( all events ) according to the event geometry on the ccd .",
    "specifically , they were sorted as single - pixel events , two - pixel split events and corner events .",
    "furthermore , they were sorted according to the event geometry within the @xmath18 pixels using the fltgrade  ( see the chandra proposers observatory guide ) . in this way , we sorted the event list into nine groups : one single - pixel event group , four two - pixel split event groups and four corner event groups .",
    "the statistics for each grade are summarized in table  [ table : summary ] .",
    "we then extracted the images in absolute sky coordinates , which places each event on the sky at the projection of the central pixel of the @xmath18 pixel event neighborhood .",
    "figure  [ event_dist ] shows an example of the distributions of four groups of corner events for q0957 + 561  image a in absolute sky coordinates that is obtained by employing uncorrected events .",
    "one can clearly see the systematic shift of their centers of gravity , depending on the fltgrade of the event .",
    "figure  [ cg_event ] shows the centers of gravity for all nine event types discussed here in absolute sky coordinates for six sources , where the square shows the pixel shape projected on the sky with the proper orientation .",
    "these figures are also obtained by using uncorrected events .",
    "we confirm that the distribution of the single - pixel events coincides with the nominal position , which is the center of the central pixel of the event .",
    "as expected , the centers of gravity of the two - pixel events lie near the centers of the pixel edges , while the centers of gravity of the three- and four - pixel events fall near the pixel corners .",
    "because the software places these uncorrected events at the centers of the pixels instead of at their true corner locations , they end up at incorrect celestial locations with the centroids of the four corner event groups making an inverted image of the pixel . applying the correction discussed in this paper",
    "would make the four pixel clouds lie on top of one another .",
    "figure  [ image ] shows images obtained using corrected corner events , as well as those obtained from all events for comparison .",
    "since we find that all images are almost point symmetric , we fit them with a point - symmetric gaussian function with constant background .",
    "the background is less than 1% of the count rate of the source .",
    "we then calculated the hpd from the best fit gaussian function for each image .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : image_size ] where all errors are 90% confidence levels .",
    "hpd@xmath19 and hpd@xmath20 represent the hpds for the images for all events and for the corner events , respectively .",
    "the actual hpd can be easily measured by counting the number of events . in this measurement",
    ", we assume the center of the gaussian function determines the image center .",
    "we then count the number of events contained in a circle as a function of diameter .",
    "we define the actual hpd as the diameter of the circle that contains half of the events appeared in a circle of @xmath21 in diameter .",
    "we confirmed that the actual hpd measured are consistent with those obtained by fitting the gaussian function within statistical uncertainties .",
    "the psf of the hrma has a size of about @xmath22 hpd on the optical axis , which corresponds to about @xmath1 m on the detector .",
    "the hpd of the final image is the root mean square of that for the hrma and that for the ccd pixel .",
    "the @xmath8 for a square distribution is @xmath23 where a  is the square size . if we use @xmath24 as the conversion factor from @xmath8 to hpd just as the case of the gaussian function , the hpd for the acis ccd pixel is about @xmath25 m which is the hpd for all events if the subpixel position of the photon is unknown .",
    "therefore , the hpd of the final image obtained for all events will be @xmath26 m on the detector or @xmath27 when projected onto the sky .",
    "however , the position accuracy of the corner events is about a few @xmath6 m since their distribution is within the charge cloud shape .",
    "this value is negligibly small compared with the psf of the hrma , and does not degrade it .",
    "we can estimate the improvement of the position resolution between all events and the corner events by @xmath28 , as listed in table  [ table : image_size ] .",
    "figure  [ delta_sigma ] shows a plot of @xmath29 along the angular distance from the optical axis as well as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we found @xmath32 by using all the data .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath33 m on the detector .",
    "this shows that by using only corner events we can significantly reduce the psf degradation caused by the under - sampling of the psf by the acis pixels . practically , we can say that the image degradation by all events is noticeable while that by the corner events is negligibly small .    in principle",
    ", the effective resolution could be improved further by using both the knowledge of the charge cloud shape and that of the grade of the multi - pixel events to determine the exact position of the x - ray within the boundary region .",
    "actually the primary charge cloud shape _ is _ known an the position on the ccd where the x - ray entered _ can _ be determined for split pixel events with sub-@xmath6 m resolution ( hiraga et al .",
    "the simplifying assumption that we have made here is that , even if the charge cloud shape is not known , we can assume that the x - ray entering position for corner events is precisely at the pixel corner . for chandra ,",
    "the angular uncertainty associated with this assumption is much smaller than the psf of the hrma .",
    "these data demonstrate that the boundary region itself is sufficiently small that this additional information would not significantly improve the psf .",
    "the fraction of the corner events , which depends on the incident x - ray spectrum as well as on the ccd type , is about @xmath34 of the total events .",
    "thus , this technique , while able to improve the effective angular resolution of chandra , does so at the cost of low efficiency .",
    "however , we have shown that this technique is effective , even for as few as 300 corner events .",
    "we have demonstrated that x - ray split events on the ccd can yield position information more precise than the pixel size .",
    "the chandra observatory has a dither motion that moves the target on the detector so that the x - rays are absorbed uniformly over the pixels .",
    "therefore , some fraction of the x - ray photons always generate corner events that can be used to achieve the finer image without degradation by the ccd pixel size .",
    "we have studied six point - like sources that were observed near the optical axis .",
    "since the split events are generated near the ccd pixel boundary , we can determine the x - ray entering position with much better resolution than the pixel size .",
    "the average image size using the corner events is @xmath2 ( hpd ) while that using all events is @xmath0 ( hpd ) . the image degradation between the image obtained by the corner events and the image obtained by all events corresponds to that expected from the ccd pixel shape .",
    "therefore , we can say that the image obtained using the corner events is almost free from the degradation of the image due to the ccd pixel shape .",
    "the corner events are generated only when x - rays enter near the pixel corner , which reduces the effective count rate .",
    "we therefore need relatively longer exposure times to obtain good statistics .",
    "finally we should add that our method is useful only for the chandra hrma that is undersampled by the detector .",
    "thus , for example , this technique can not be applied to xmm - newton observations .",
