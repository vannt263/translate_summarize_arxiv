    "one reason no one notices them , however , is that only a small fraction occur in physical regions of scattering or decay .",
    "see fig . 2 later on .",
    "the conditions for physical `` null zones '' are sufficiently restrictive that the first examples of radiation zeros ( the mikaelian - samuel - sahdev zeros@xcite ) , were discovered only when radiative weak - boson production was analyzed .",

    "so far , all are converging to the standard model predictions.@xcite the progress has been accelerated by theoretical support by baur , errede , and landsberg@xcite , showing that laboratory rapidity correlations involving the photon and the charged decay lepton display a pronounced dip if the radiation zero exists . in a very nice talk ,",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    permit me to digress for a moment .",
    "our original work@xcite on the production of electroweak pairs in proton collisions @xmath4 took place in the late @xmath5s .",
    "this was presented as an alternative to electron colliders , betting that the necessary energy threshold would first be reached by proton machines .",
    "and the theoretical discovery of the first radiation zero came in the midst of looking at the corresponding born calculations .",
    "so it is gratifying , after all these years , to be at the present conference where many experimental results , including those pertaining to the @xmath6 zero , have now been achieved .    in view of the role of the @xmath6 channel , i",
    "have been given the opportunity to review the theory of the radiation zero , and to connect it to another signature of interest , `` approximate '' zeros .",
    "owing to the fact that out of all the people from all the old collaborations from cwru , oklahoma state , wisconsin , and slac , i happen to be the only one present means i have some responsibility to mention the early work .",
    "this is also a welcome chance to talk about a theoretical development that , because of the lack of examples , is not well known , but perhaps should be . continuing experimental progress provides a good incentive .    in particular",
    ", i would like to emphasize a picture that emerges in the proof of general radiation zero theorems .",
    "the emission , or absorption , of a gauge boson can be viewed as a local lorentz transformation ( or better , a poincare transformation ) of the particle doing the emitting or absorbing .",
    "this may be of importance in future model building , especially since our only successful theories to date , gauge theories , lead to universal forms for this transformation .",
    "it seems to me that the experimental , computational and theoretical consequences of radiation zeros and their generalizations are easiest to describe if we first look at an archetypal theorem for their existence and location .",
    "the classical limit of such zeros will also be evident .",
    "the primary example of the general set of radiation zero theorems found by brodsky , kowalski , and meeski@xcite is for the emission of single photons .",
    "the theorem is the following .",
    "consider the quantum amplitude @xmath7 for the emission of a single photon with momentum q. besides the photon , assume there are @xmath8 other particle legs ( @xmath9 particles in and @xmath10 particles plus @xmath11 out , say ) .",
    "the theorem is that the tree amplitude approximation vanishes , independent of anybody s spin , for common charge - to - light - cone - energy ratios , viz . @xmath12 where the @xmath13 particle has electric charge @xmath14 and four - momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the stipulations are that all couplings must be `` gauge - theoretic '' .",
    "that is , the photon couplings to the particles must be as prescribed by local gauge theory , and any derivative couplings among the particles themselves must be gauge covariant .",
    "also , scalar , spinor , and vector particles can be accommodated ( spins @xmath16 ) .",
    "we return at the end to the question of higher spins .",
    "the factors @xmath17 come from the coupling and particle propagator denominator .",
    "it is easy to go into the complex plane to make them equal , and hence zeros are all over the ( complex ) place . but for them to be equal in physical phase space , the first and obvious requirement is that all charges must have the same sign ( since @xmath18 ) .",
    "this knocks out many reactions . by the way",
    ", there are only @xmath19 independent equations .",
    "interestingly and importantly , the last ratio is automatically the same if the rest are equal , by virtue of charge and momentum conservation .    in the garden variety reactions",
    ", we could look , for example , at electron - electron bremsstrahlung , @xmath20 .",
    "the born amplitude vanishes if the photon is at right angles to the c.m .",
    "beam direction , and the final electrons have the same energy .",
    "the null zone is two - dimensional , and the reason this radiation zero was not noticed in radiative corrections calculations is that the final - state phase space is sufficiently high dimensional .",
    "[ [ experimental ] ] experimental + + + + + + + + + + + +    the null zone conditions explain why it took so long to discover radiation zeros .",
    "_ we had to wait for fractionally charged quarks and weak bosons in order to get three things : same - sign fermion - antifermion pairs , a process well - approximated by a born amplitude , and only three particles plus the photon so the null zone was simple . _ the amplitude for @xmath21 vanishes at a photon scattering angle determined by the quark charges .",
    "( the @xmath22 amplitude vanishes at the edge of phase space and is easily misinterpreted as a helicity constraint . )",
    "the corresponding null zone in radiative @xmath23 decay@xcite is a line in the dalitz plot .",
    "the first is still the best example .",
    "again , i can refer to tao han s talk , but",
    "the relevance is that only for the very restrictive couplings coming out of gauge theory does the zero occur . in view of the results of many calculations with anomalous couplings , and the proof ( see below ) of the pertinent theorem , i do not think it would be hard to put together another theorem . accepting the present particle content of our world , _ only in the standard electroweak theory will there be a zero in the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "_ in any other theory including composite models the rapidity dip will get filled in .",
    "we say such experiments test gauge theories and test the electromagnetic properties of weak bosons .",
    "@xmath24 :)    what about other photonic zeros ? the aforementioned zero in electron - electron bremsstrahlung is less interesting as a test , and involves more particles .",
    "there has been work on electron - quark and quark - antiquark bremsstrahlung , as tests of quark properties , but these lead to jet identification experiments , along with the more complicated phase space.@xcite we will come back to the subject of more tests of weak - boson properties in a bit .",

    "the radiation symmetry may be used , as gauge invariance is used , to check the increasingly laborious calculations used in higher - order perturbation theory studies .",

    "[ [ theoretical ] ] theoretical + + + + + + + + + + +    the mechanism in the radiation zero phenomena that has rather uniquely shown itself is the relation between a photon coupling and local poincare invariance .",
    "we repeat that only gauge theory couplings lead to universal space - time transformations , and it is of value to sketch the proof in order to see how this connection is exposed and what universality means .",
    "we can describe the proof fairly succinctly in terms of photon attachments in a minute . but first let us lay some groundwork .",
    "define a `` source '' graph @xmath26 with which we will generate the complete tree radiation amplitude by the attachment of a photon in all possible ways .",
    "after simplification of the product of vertex and propagator for the attachment of a photon to a given leg , the complete tree for a source graph @xmath27 made up of a single vertex ( no internal lines ) is @xmath28 where we see the @xmath29 factors emerge from the coupling and propagator denominator .",
    "the coefficient `` vertex current '' @xmath30 is the result of inserting the current @xmath31 into the @xmath13 leg , with @xmath32 the convection current is @xmath33 , the spin current is a first - order momentum - space lorentz transformation of the wave function ( e.g. , @xmath34 for a spinor ) , the contact current is the corresponding transformation of single derivative couplings and the yang - mills current has the form of @xmath35 ( the q terms in the yang - mills vertex ) . the first - order lorentz parameter tensor is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the photon polarization vector .",
    "the key identity is that the sum over the vertex currents is zero @xmath38 because the sum over the convection currents vanishes by momentum conservation , the sum over the combination of spin currents and contact currents vanishes by lorentz invariance , and the sum over the yang - mills current vanishes by the bianchi identity .",
    "equal @xmath29 factors can be pulled out of the sum eq.(3 ) and the complete radiative process for a vertex source graph vanishes by eq.(6 ) .",
    "the vertex graph could have involved any number of particles , but the universal forms of the various currents @xmath31 are preserved only if there are important restrictions on any derivative couplings present .",
    "there can be no derivatives of dirac fields ; single derivatives of scalar fields are allowed ; single derivatives of vector fields and double derivatives of scalar fields are allowed but only in yang - mills trilinear form ( reminding us of the relationship between the longitudinal vector boson and the goldstone bosons in spontaneous symmetry breaking ) . and the photon couplings also must follow the gauge algorithm : all derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives .",
    "a succinct way of looking at the previous result is that the attachment of a photon generates transformations .",
    "the convection current corresponds to a ( first - order ) displacement of that leg s wave function , the spin current to its lorentz transformation , and the contact current to a lorentz transformation of the derivative coupling . for common @xmath29",
    ", all these transformations correspond to the same universal element and they cancel by invariance .",
    "the photon attachment is a first - order poincare transformation on the vertex amplitude , but by the invariance of that amplitude , it becomes `` unattached '' in the null zone .",
    "to finish the proof , consider general tree source graphs @xmath26 with ( fixed ) internal lines . in tacking a photon in all possible ways onto the source graph ,",
    "the new ingredient is internal line attachment .",
    "but there are ward - like identities that simplify the problem and are of the generic form ( d denotes propagators ) @xmath39 note that we get exactly the same kind of @xmath40 factor for each internal leg of each vertex that we had for the external legs .",
    "furthermore , in the null zone the internal ratio @xmath41 will equal the common external ratio by the same rotten fruit calculation described earlier .",
    "these identities have reduced the problem to a sum of vertex - source problems , and by the earlier arguments , the null zone applies to all trees .",
    "the result of applying the decomposition identities and the contracted forms of the external leg attachments is a new reduced and rearranged amplitude , a sum over vertices @xmath42 with the vertex attachments separated out from the rest of the graph factors @xmath43 .",
    "each term in the sum is separately gauge invariant .",
    "the radiation zero is evident from the fact that each factor @xmath44 vanishes in the null zone .",
    "[ [ alternate - theorem . ] ] alternate theorem .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    notice that charge conservation @xmath45 is dual to eq.(6 ) and implies @xmath46 this alternate interference theorem refers to zeros that , by contrast , are spin - dependent but independent of charge .",
    "both theorems can be stated as symmetries.@xcite they correspond to invariance under either replacement , @xmath47 by the appropriate choice of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , all zeros can be made explicit in a `` radiation representation '' for the vertex amplitudes : @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "this reduces @xmath52 to a single factored form for the simplest case , @xmath53 , in agreement with the original work by goebel , halzen and leveille.@xcite their beguiling statement for the original @xmath54 is that the three feynman amplitudes reduce to the sum of two abelian ( qed - like ) diagrams multiplied by a factor in which the zero is explicit .",
    "what about neutrals amongst the @xmath8 particles , including other photons ?",
    "the quick answer from an examination of the @xmath29 factor is the right one .",
    "all neutral particles must be massless and travel in the same direction as the photon .",
    "strictly , in the proof we must have the corresponding current @xmath30 vanish in the null zone , and this is what is found .",
    "in fact , the multiphoton zeros and the connection to local poincare transformations follow from a decoupling theorem  @xcite for the scattering of a system of particles immersed in an external electromagnetic plane wave . on the way to the theorem",
    "it is first shown that for a particle coupled to an external electromagnetic plane wave the wave functions for spins @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 all can be written in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the free solution .",
    "the @xmath60,@xmath61,@xmath62 are local gauge , lorentz , and displacement transformations , respectively , whose first - order terms are exactly the ones we have been talking about .",
    "the identity used to show that these are indeed solutions ends up being a cornerstone to the whole radiation zero business .",
    "it is @xmath63 in which @xmath64 is the covariant derivative ( hiding the plane wave inside it ) and @xmath65 is the finite lorentz transformation ( little group element , actually ) corresponding to ye olde @xmath66 .",
    "_ it is observed that the plane wave has been swallowed up into a local space - time symmetry of the equation of motion . _",
    "the @xmath65 terms go away by invariance , and is nt this familiar by now ?",
    "to finish the story of the theorem , consider the tree amplitude for the scattering of a system of particles with no external field .",
    "if we turn on an external electromagnetic field , the internal and external legs of the tree amplitude are altered according to the fourier transforms of the @xmath67 factors . in the null zone ,",
    "all factors collapse to unity from charge conservation , lorentz invariance , and momentum conservation .",
    "i have not done justice to the whole story , but the bottom line is that , like perseus , the system of particles can be invisible to an external plane wave in special regions of phase space .",
    "like some other recently well - publicized evidence , measurements of radiation zeros are destined to be contaminated , compromised and ultimately corrupted .",
    "see fig . 2 . to start with",
    ", higher - order corrections will not vanish in the null zone .",
    "the internal factors @xmath29 in closed loops correspond to momenta @xmath68 that is integrated over ; these factors are certainly not fixed by the outside legs . _ it is interesting , however , that radiation symmetry eqs.(10 ) still hold for the complete quantum amplitude to all orders in perturbation theory . _",
    "anomalous photon couplings spoil the zeros in lowest order .",
    "many speakers at this conference have focused on limits that can be set on the @xmath69 and @xmath70 parameters for both @xmath3 and @xmath71 trilinear couplings . as indicated by the earlier remarks ,",
    "the @xmath6 zero provides litmus tests for these parameters .",
    "any deviations from the gauge theory values lead to momentum dependence in the photon attachment currents such that the first - order transformations can no longer be universal .",
    "higher derivatives than the ones announced as `` gauge - theoretic '' produce terms in the @xmath72 currents that are higher order in @xmath73 .",
    "these terms have _ a priori _ no mechanism , no additional symmetry to effect their cancellation in a sum over all the legs of a given vertex .",
    "the yang - mills @xmath74@xmath75 is the one exception that proves the rule .",
    "there are zeros associated with any gauge group when the corresponding massless gauge bosons are emitted .",
    "the `` charges '' now are the clebsch - gordan coefficients coming from the attachment of a boson belonging to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the bad things here are two - fold . in qcd ,",
    "color charges are averaged or summed over in hadronic reactions .",
    "the zeros are for the most part washed out , even when perturbation theory is applicable ( in deep inelastic reactions , and so forth ) . in thinking of the weak bosons themselves ,",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "_ radiation zeros require the internal symmetry to remain good : the charges `` @xmath14 '' must be conserved .",
    "_ of course , the weak - boson masses are far from vanishing ; a nonvanishing @xmath76 itself ruins radiation interference .",
    "it is not surprising that in a supersymmetric or extended supersymmetric world , the photonic zeros would have partner photino zeros and `` sphotino '' zeros .",
    "there are `` szeros '' and `` xeros '' in the supersymmetrically extended gauge sector.@xcite the well - known problem is that susy is experimentally evasive and hardly unbroken .",
    "an `` approximate zero '' in @xmath77 production by fermion - antifermion annihilation has been proposed recently by baur , han and ohnemus@xcite as another test of the self - couplings . at high energies ,",
    "the sensitivity to the @xmath71 vertex is not so terribly different than that of the @xmath6 channel on the @xmath3 vertex .",
    "it was briefly noted in the early , detailed paper on radiation zeros@xcite that the dip structure found@xcite in the @xmath77 angular distributions corresponds to an approximate radiation interference zero .",
    "_ show that even in the high - energy limit there is a nonvanishing longitudinal helicity amplitude . even if the c.m .",
    "energy is large compared with the masses , the couplings still refer to a broken symmetry theory and the zero will remain approximate at high energy .",
    "the approximate zero corresponds to broken radiation symmetry , nevertheless , and the origin and mechanism for the partial cancelations are the same as for the exact zeros .    some day , experiments on multiboson zeros , exact or approximate , will make sense .",
    "recent discussions of multiphoton / gluon reactions@xcite could be extended to the broken symmetry weak - boson production channels . in @xmath78 production , for example , quadrilinear couplings come into play , along with a multi-@xmath79 approximate zero .",
    "but whether these couplings can be probed , even in the next generation of colliders , is very much open to question .",
    "it may seem reasonable to say that the radiation zero phenomena are well understood . among other things , they are another property of gauge theories .",

    "the null zone is exactly the same as that for the completely destructive interference of radiation by charge lines ( a classical convection current calculation@xcite ) and is preserved by the fully relativistic quantum born approximation for gauge theories .",

    "this is understandable since the gauge bosons belong to adjoint representations of both the lie gauge groups and the poincare space - time group . only for the gauge couplings ,",
