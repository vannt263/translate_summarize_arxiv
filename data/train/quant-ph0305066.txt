    "the investigation of squeezed states of light  @xcite is of fundamental interest , and has applications to practical precision measurements  @xcite . recently , spin squeezed states for an ensemble of atoms  @xcite have become important , with potential applications to atomic interferometers and precise atomic clocks . for quantum information applications  @xcite , the close relation between atomic spin squeezing and quantum entanglement  @xcite enhance the importance of atomic spin squeezing .",
    "entanglement and bosonic squeezing are also related  @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the relationship between these two mathematically distinct yet intuitively connected squeezing figures of merit .",
    "let us first review bosonic quadrature squeezing by introducing two quadrature operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 given by @xmath2 where operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation and creation operators of a boson , respectively .",
    "the two quadrature operators satisfy the commutation relation @xmath5=2i$ ] , which yields the uncertainty relation @xmath6 .",
    "a state is squeezed if either @xmath7 or @xmath8 is less than 1 .",
    "second , we review the atomic spin squeezing by considering an ensemble of @xmath9 two - level atoms characterized by an angular momentum vector operator @xmath10 satisfying the su(2 ) algebra @xmath11=\\pm s_{\\pm } , \\,[s_{+},s_{-}]=2s_z,\\,s_{\\pm } = s_x\\pm is_y . \\label{su2}\\ ] ] several definitions of spin squeezed states permeate in the literature  @xcite",
    ". there are two well - accepted definitions , one is given by kitagawa and ueda  @xcite , and another by wineland et al .",
    "the spin squeezing parameter associated with the former definition is given by  @xcite @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath13 refers to an axis perpendicular to the mean spin @xmath14 , for which the minimal value of the variance @xmath15 is obtained , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the inequality @xmath18 indicates that the system is spin squeezed",
    ". we will also consider the definition of spin squeezing given by wineland et al .",
    "@xcite , and show that the spin squeezing by the two definitions reduces to the bosonic squeezing in the limit of large number of atoms .",
    "another reason for adopting the definitions is that they are both closely related to quantum entanglement of @xmath9 two - level atoms  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the heisenberg - weyl algebra describing the bosonic mode can be obtained by contraction from the su(2 ) algebra describing the ensemble of atoms  @xcite . to see this , we define @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the commutation relation ( [ su2 ] ) , we have @xmath21=b^{\\dagger } , \\;[{\\cal n},b]=-b,\\;[b , b^{\\dagger } ] = 1-\\frac{{\\cal n}}j,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the  number operator \" , and its eigenvalues vary from 0 to @xmath9 counting the number of excited atoms . in the limit of @xmath23 the operators @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the commutation relations of the heisenberg - weyl algebra .",
    "note that , when we take the limit , the average number of excited atoms @xmath27 should be much less than the total number of atoms @xmath9 .",
    "we can also use the usual holstein - primakoff transformation  @xcite : @xmath28 in the limit of @xmath23 we have @xmath29 by expanding the square root and neglecting terms of @xmath30 .",
    "we see that the bosonic system and the atomic spin system are connected by the large @xmath31 limit from an algebraic point of view .",
    "this connection motivates us to ask if these two kinds of squeezing are also related by this limit .",
    "moreover , the link between bosonic squeezing and atomic squeezing is exemplified by the fact that the squeezed light can be obtained from spin squeezed atoms by raman scattering of a strong laser pulse  @xcite , implying a close relation between these two kinds of squeezing .",
    "we also study squeezing transfer between the light field and the atomic system .",
    "these analyses points to a relation between bosonic squeezing and atomic squeezing that helps to resolve the ambiguity of defining spin squeezing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show that atomic spin squeezing reduces to bosonic quadrature squeezing in the large @xmath9 limit . as an example , in sec .",
    "iii , even and odd spin coherent states are considered , and spin squeezing of them exactly reduces to the squeezing of even and odd bosonic coherent states in the above limit . in sec .",
    "iv , we study squeezing transfer between light field and an atomic system .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "in the standard analyses of bosonic quadrature squeezing , both the variances @xmath7 and @xmath8 are calculated , and @xmath32 or @xmath33 indicates bosonic squeezing . here , for our purposes , we consider the so - called principle quadrature squeezing  @xcite , and define an appropriate quadrature operator @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being special cases .",
    "bosonic squeezing is characterized by one parameter  @xcite @xmath37 which is the minimum value of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 indicates principle squeezing .",
    "the definition of @xmath41 provides an atomic squeezing counterpart to bosonic squeezing .    to display this connection",
    ", we consider even ( odd ) states .",
    "these states refer to those being a superposition of even ( odd ) fock states for the bosonic system , and those being a superposition of dicke states @xmath42 with the even ( odd ) excitations for the atomic system .",
    "the dicke states @xmath43 satisfies  @xcite @xmath44 specifically , even and odd bosonic coherent states have been realized experimentally for a quantized cavity field  @xcite , vibrational motion of trapped ions  @xcite , and an electron in a rydberg atomic system  @xcite . in the context of cavity qed , gerry and grobe  @xcite showed that the even and odd atomic spin coherent states can be generated by the use of a dispersive interaction between atoms and field via a state reduction technique .",
    "the basis idea of the technique is that we first entangle atoms and field , and then make an appropriate quantum measurement .",
    "after the measurement , we can obtain desire states such as even and odd states .",
    "even and odd states are considered here because , in addition to exhibiting squeezing , such states are amenable to exact analytical calculations .",
    "thus , these states serve as examples for demonstrating connections between bosonic and atomic squeezing .    for even ( odd ) states , @xmath45 , so , from eq .",

    "this result displays a direct connection between bosonic squeezing and atomic squeezing . from an experimental point of view , the number of atoms is typically large enough , so the observed atomic squeezing is expected to approximate the bosonic quadrature squeezing . as a remark , eqs .",
    "( [ squu1 ] ) and ( [ squ2 ] ) obtained for even and odd states are also applicable to arbitrary states , which is discussed in appendix a.",
    "we now exemplify the reduction displayed above by first considering the even bosonic coherent state ( ebcs ) @xmath53 and the odd bosonic coherent state ( obcs ) @xmath54",

    "( [ squ2 ] ) leads to the result that the spin squeezing parameter is only determined by the expectation values @xmath71 and @xmath72 another result is that @xmath73 to obtain this result , we first notice that if the escs and oscs are written as @xmath74 then @xmath75 , and @xmath76 since @xmath77 from the above equation , we obtain @xmath73 thus , from eq .",

    "atomic squeezed states can be generated by interacting with squeezed light  @xcite .",
    "conversely , squeezed light states can be generated from squeezed atoms  @xcite . here",
    ", we study the squeezing transfer from light to atomic system via the single - mode dicke hamiltonian under the rotating wave approximation ( @xmath101 )  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the atomic splitting , @xmath104 is the field frequency , and @xmath105 is the atom - field coupling . for the resonant case ( @xmath106 ) , the dicke hamiltonian in the interaction picture is written as @xmath107 in the following , we work in the interaction picture .",
    "there is a conserved parity @xmath108 associated with the dicke hamiltonian , which is given by @xmath109=[\\pi , h_{\\rm i}]=0.\\ ] ] we choose the initial state of the whole system as @xmath110 i.e. , the light is in the ebcs  ( [ eocs ] ) and each atom is prepared in the ground state . here , in order to see better squeezing transfer , we choose @xmath111 which corresponds to maximal squeezing ( @xmath112 ) of the ebcs with respect to @xmath113 .",
    "the state vector at time @xmath114 under hamiltonian evolution is formally written as @xmath115 it is easy to see that the state at arbitrary time @xmath114 has a definite parity 1 , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "this result leads to the expectation values of @xmath117 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 being zero since the parity will change after the action of these operators on the state .",
    "thus , for state @xmath118 , we may apply eqs .",
    "( [ squu1 ] ) and ( [ squ2 ] ) to examine squeezing .",
    "before numerical calculations of squeezing , we consider two special cases : @xmath119 and the limit @xmath120 . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the single two - level atom can not be spin squeezed since @xmath121 for arbitrary atomic state . in the limit of @xmath120 , from eq .",
    "( [ limit2 ] ) , the hamiltonian @xmath122 reduces to the effective hamiltonian @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 describes the effective bosonic mode .",
    "the above hamiltonian describes the interaction of two bosonic modes , and can be used to construct a swap gate for two modes as follows  @xcite @xmath126 thus , the unitary operator @xmath127 at scaled time @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) is the swap gate up to the local operator @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "we see that in the limit of @xmath120 , at time @xmath131 , the state in one system swaps with that of anther system .",
    "therefore , squeezing is of course perfectly transferred .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath49 ( cross points ) versus @xmath132 for different number of atoms.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    now we numerically examine the intermediate case , i.e. , @xmath133 .",
    "figure 1 plots the two squeezing parameters @xmath41 and @xmath49 for state @xmath118 .",
    "we observe that beside the case of @xmath119 ( this case is plotted for comparison ) , the atomic state is spin squeezed over most of the time , and is maximally squeezed near the point @xmath131 .",
    "we see a dip of bosonic squeezing around @xmath131 , and it disappears with the increase of number of atoms .",
    "the dip is due to a complicated entanglement between light and atomic systems .",
    "as time goes on , for the case of @xmath134 , the decrease ( increase ) of light squeezing goes with the increase ( decrease ) of atomic squeezing for most of the time , i.e , the transfer of squeezing from light to atoms is nearly perfect .",

    "the two functions are given by @xmath139 from fig .  2 , we see clearly that the initial light squeezing due to quantum interference between two components  @xmath140  in the ebcs . as times goes on , within the considered time range , light squeezing decreases .",
    "contrary to the behaviour of the @xmath137 function for field , from the dynamics of the husimi function in fig .",
    "3 , the atoms become more squeezed as time goes on .",
    "the @xmath137 function at time @xmath141 and the husimi function at @xmath142 are very similar , indicating near perfect transference of squeezing .",
    "function for atoms with @xmath135 and @xmath136.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the bosonic quadrature squeezing and atomic spin squeezing defined by kitagawa and ueda  @xcite , and found that atomic squeezing reduces to bosonic squeezing for even and odd states .",
    "we have proved that the escs always exhibits spin squeezing , whereas the oscs does not , which is similar to the case of bosonic squeezing that ebcs always exhibit quadrature squeezing , while the obcs does not . for arbitrary atomic states ,",
    "( [ squ2 ] ) is applicable since we can always rotate the mean spin along @xmath143 direction .",
    "then , formally the reduction of atomic squeezing to bosonic squeezing in the large @xmath9 limit can be obtained for arbitrary states .",
    "however , the rotation changes mean excitation number @xmath27 .",
    "thus , only when @xmath27 is low enough after the rotation can we take the limit and obtain the reduction .    obviously , the reduction depends on the choice of criteria for squeezing .",
    "now , we examine another spin squeezing criterion given in refs .",
    "@xcite , and see if it can reduces to the bosonic quadrature squeezing .",
    "the corresponding squeezing parameter for even and odd states can be written as  @xcite @xmath144 we see that these two squeezing parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath145 , differ only by a multiplicative factor . in the limit of @xmath52 , from eq .",
    "( [ limit2 ] ) , the squeezing parameter @xmath49 reduces to @xmath41 ( [ squu1 ] ) for bosonic squeezing and the multiplicative factor reduces to 1 .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ xixixixi ] ) , the squeezing parameter @xmath145 also reduces to the bosonic squeezing parameter .",
    "thus , according to the two typical spin squeezing definitions , the spin squeezing reduces to the bosonic squeezing in the limit of @xmath52 .",
    "we have further studied squeezing transfer from light field to atomic system via the resonant dicke hamiltonian , and observe a nearly perfect transfer of squeezing at a certain interaction time for large number of atoms . in the context of experiments on spin squeezing of atomic ensembles , in general ,",
    "there is large number of atoms .",
    "therefore , we expect experimental observations of perfect squeezing transfer and light quadrature squeezing behaviours of atomic spin squeezing when the number of atoms are large and the number of excited atoms are much less than the number of total atoms .",
    "this project has been supported by an australian research council large grant .",
    "although the squeezing parameters @xmath146 of ( [ squu1 ] ) and @xmath68 of ( [ squ2 ] ) are derived for even and odd states , they are applicable to arbitrary states .",
    "consider a state of light @xmath147 and the displaced state @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the displacement operator .",
    "the squeezing of these two states is identical as we have @xmath150 the operator @xmath151 and @xmath152 only differ by an additive constant ; thus their variances on a state are equal and states @xmath153 and @xmath147 exhibit same squeezing .",
    "therefore , we can always displace a state @xmath147 by a quantity @xmath154 to adjust the expectation value of @xmath152 to zero and keep the squeezing invariant , where @xmath155 applying eq .",
    "( [ squu1 ] ) to state @xmath156 leads to @xmath157 which is just the result in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the atomic system , we consider the state of the atomic ensemble @xmath158 and rotated state @xmath159 the spin squeezing is invariant under the rotation @xmath160  @xcite , which we show briefly here .",
    "note the fact that the mean spin @xmath161 for the two states @xmath158 and @xmath162 differ by an orthogonal matrix @xmath163 @xmath164 thus , the mean spin direction @xmath165 and @xmath166 for state @xmath158 will become @xmath167 and @xmath168 for the rotated state @xmath169 the absolute value of the mean spin is unchanged . from eq .",
    "( [ xixixi ] ) , we may rewrite the squeezing parameter as @xmath170 then , it becomes obvious that the squeezing parameters are the same for the two states @xmath158 and @xmath171 as the spin squeezing is invariant under the rotation @xmath172 we can always rotate the mean spin along the @xmath143 direction by applying @xmath173 to state @xmath174 , and eq .",
