    "motivated by string / m theory , the ads / cft correspondence , and the hierarchy problem of particle physics , braneworld models were studied actively in recent years @xcite-@xcite . in these models , our universe is realized as a boundary of a higher dimensional spacetime . in particular , a well studied example is when the bulk is an ads space . in the cosmological context ,",
    "embedding of a four dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker universe was also considered when the bulk is described by ads or ads black hole nihe99,adsbhworld . in the latter case ,",
    "the mass of the black hole was found to effectively act as an energy density on the brane with the same equation of state of radiation . representing radiation as conformal matter and exploiting ads / cft correspondence , the cardy - verlinde formula @xcite for the entropy",
    "was found for the universe ( see @xcite , for the entropy formula in the case of ds black hole ) .",
    "+ in either of the above cases , however , the cosmological evolution on the brane is modified at small scales . in particular , if the bulk space is taken to be an ads black hole _ with charge _ , the universe can ` bounce ' @xcite .",
    "that is , the brane makes a smooth transition from a contracting phase to an expanding phase . from a four - dimensional point of view",
    ", singularity theorems @xcite suggest that such a bounce can not occur as long as certain energy conditions apply .",
    "hence , a key ingredient in producing the bounce is the fact that the bulk geometry may contribute a negative energy density to the effective stress - energy on the brane @xcite . at first sight",
    "these bouncing braneworlds are quite remarkable , since they provide a context in which the evolution evades any cosmological singularities while the dynamics is still controlled by a simple ( orthodox ) effective action .",
    "in particular , it seems that one can perform reliable calculations without deliberation on the effects of quantum gravity or the details of the ultimate underlying theory .",
    "hence , several authors @xcite have pursued further developments for these bouncing braneworlds .",
    "however the authors of @xcite have found that generically these cosmologies are in fact singular . in particular , they have shown that a bouncing brane must cross the cauchy horizon in the bulk space . however , the latter surface is unstable when arbitrarily small excitations are introduced in the bulk spacetime .",
    "+ in this paper we describe solutions of the bouncing braneworld theory and also determine their stability . to do this",
    ", we use a set of convenient phase - space variables similar to those introduced in @xcite .",
    "the critical points of the system of differential equations in the space of these variables describe interesting non - static solutions .",
    "a method for evaluating the eigenvalues of the critical points of the friedmann and bianchi models was introduced by goliath and ellis @xcite and further used in the analysis by campos and sopuerta @xcite of the randall sundrum braneworld theory .",
    "these latter authors gave a complete description of stationary points in an appropriately chosen phase space of the cosmological setup and investigated their stability with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations .",
    "the authors worked in the frames of the randall sundrum braneworld theory without the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane .",
    "cosmological solutions and their stability with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations in the braneworld model with the scalar - curvature term in the action for the brane have further been studied by iakubovskyi and shtanov @xcite .",
    "we start by considering a @xmath1dimensional brane in a space - time described by a @xmath2dimensional charged ads black hole .",
    "the background metric is then given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 are adm mass and charge , respectively , @xmath7 is the curvature radius of space , @xmath8 is a discrete parameter which indicates the horizon topology , namely @xmath9 + 1 , 0 and -1 for a spherical , flat and hyperbolic geometry respectively , and @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the five - dimensional newton constant , and @xmath12 is the dimensionless volume element associated with @xmath13 ( a three - dimensional spacelike hypersurface of constant curvature ) .",
    "+ tuning the brane cosmological constant to zero , we get the following induced equation on the brane : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter and dot denotes derivation with respect to the brane time @xmath16 .",
    "if we consider the more physically relevant case in which a perfect fluid with equation of state of radiation is present on the brane , then the first friedmann equation takes the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy density defined by @xmath19 and the four - dimensional energy @xmath20 is given by e_4=m = e , [ ener2 ] where @xmath21 is the thermodynamical energy of the black hole .",
    "also in eq.([shab1 ] ) @xmath22 is the tension of the brane , while @xmath23 is the energy density of the radiation .",
    "the hubble equation can be rewritten as h^2=+++(+_br)- 3 _ 4 ^ 2 q^2 , [ shab2 ] where _",
    "4=-=_br- , [ cosmo ] is the effective cosmological constant of the brane . by tuning the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension @xmath24 ,",
    "the effective four dimensional cosmological constant @xmath25 can be set to zero .",
    "this critical brane is what we would like to consider in the following .",
    "the radiation energy density @xmath23 on the brane is _",
    "br= , [ tens ] where @xmath26 is a constant , hence we can rewrite the cosmological equation ( [ shab2 ] ) as h^2=+(_4m+)-+ .",
    "[ modhub2]by defining a=(_4m+ ) [ eqa ] , b= [ eqb],and c=,[eqc ] eq.([modhub2 ] ) takes on the following form in terms of the above parameters h^2=+-+ [ par ]",
    "in this section , we describe solutions of the braneworld theory under investigation and also determine their stability . to do this",
    ", we use a set of convenient phase - space variables similar to those introduced in @xcite .",
    "now , we introduce the notation similar to those of @xcite @xmath27 and work in the @xmath28-dimensional @xmath29-space @xmath30 . in this space ,",
    "the @xmath29 parameters are not independent since the friedmann equation ( [ freedman ] ) reads @xmath31 in this case the state space defined by the variables @xmath30 is no longer compact ( because now @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , we can introduce another set of variables describing a compact state space .",
    "firstly , instead of using the hubble function @xmath33 we will use the following quantity @xmath34 and from it , let us define the following dimensionless variables @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38    from these definitions we see that now the case @xmath39 is included . moreover , the friedmann equation takes the following form @xmath40 which , together with the fact that @xmath41 [ see equation ( [ ppp ] ) ] , implies that the state space defined by the new variables is indeed compact .    introducing the primed time derivative @xmath42",
    "one obtains the system of first - order differential equations @xmath43\\ , , \\smallskip \\\\",
    "z'=-z^2[q-(q-2\\omega_b)z^2]\\ , , \\smallskip \\\\",
    "\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}'=2\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(q-2\\omega_b)z^3\\ , , \\smallskip \\\\",
    "\\tilde{\\omega}_{a}'=2\\tilde{\\omega}_{a}[-1+(q-2\\omega_b)z^2]z\\ , , \\smallskip \\\\ \\tilde{\\omega}_{c } ' = 2 \\tilde{\\omega}_{c } [ -3+(q-2\\omega_b)z^2]z\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 the evolution equation for @xmath45 is not coupled to the rest , so we will not consider it for the dynamical study .",
    "therefore , we just study the dynamical system for the variables @xmath46 , determined by the equations ( [ omemgaeq ] ) .",
    "the behavior of this system of equations in the neighborhood of its stationary point is determined by the corresponding matrix of its linearization .",
    "the real parts of its eigenvalues tell us whether the corresponding cosmological solution is stable or unstable with respect to the homogeneous perturbations @xcite . to begin with",
    ", we have to find the critical points of this dynamical system , which can be written in vector form as follows @xmath47 where @xmath48 can be extracted from([omemgaeq ] ) .",
    "the critical points , @xmath49 , namely the points at which the system will stay provided it is initially at there , are given by the condition @xmath50 their dynamical character is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath51 if the real part of the eigenvalues of a critical point is not zero , the point is said to be _ hyperbolic _ @xcite . in this case , the dynamical character of the critical point is determined by the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues : if all of them are positive , the point is said to be a _",
    "repeller _ , because arbitrarily small deviations from this point will move the system away from this state .",
    "if all of them are negative the point is called an _ attractor _ because if we move the system slightly from this point in an arbitrary way , it will return to it .",
    "otherwise , we say the critical point is a _ saddle _ point .",
    "+ we construct our models as follows : +   + * ( 1 ) *  the model @xmath52 , or @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "we have @xmath55 and the eigenvalues are @xmath56    * ( 2 ) *  the model @xmath57 , or @xmath58 .",
    "we have @xmath59 and the eigenvalues are @xmath60    * ( 3 ) *  the model @xmath61 , or @xmath62 .",
    "we have @xmath63 and the eigenvalues are @xmath64 * ( 4 ) * the model @xmath65 , or @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constants satisfying ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of these points can be obtained in a straightforward manner and show a saddle point , which has not been included here .",
    "hence , @xmath65 represents a set of infinite saddle points whose line element is that of an open universe ( @xmath69 ) with @xmath70 .",
    "the dynamical system ( [ omemgaeq ] ) has three hyperbolic critical points as follows : +   + i ) the model @xmath71 , @xmath72 with the critical point of an _ attractor _ type .",

    "+ iv ) the model @xmath65 , @xmath77 with the critical point of a _ saddle point _ type .",
    "the four models have been depicted within the compact state space , in fig.(1 ) .",
    "there are just trajectories on the planes , which are invariant submanifolds of the state space .",
    "in this work , we have studied bouncing cosmological solutions and their stability with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations in a braneworld theory in which the bulk is given by a five - dimensional charged ads black hole spacetime with matter field confined in a d3 brane .",
    "the effects of the charge of five - dimensional black hole in the bulk has been considered . by including this quantity in the analysis",
    "we have obtained four models with the critical points of an _ attractor _ , a couple _ saddle point _ and a _ repeller _ , respectively , and constructed the complete state space for these cosmological models .",
