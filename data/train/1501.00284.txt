    "0.1 cm the inner boundary condition imposed by the event horizon requires that accretion onto astrophysical black holes may manifest the transonic behavior in general @xcite . for low angular momentum inviscid axisymmetric flow under the influence of the post - newtonian pseudo - schwarzschild black hole potentials multi - transonicity may be realized in the phase - portrait of the stationary accretion solutions- leading to the possibility of the formation of steady standing shock in between the saddle type outer sonic point and the center type middle critical point @xcite .",
    "+ the inviscid flow assumption , however , requires that the accretion flow is characterized by reasonably low angular momentum .",
    "such angular momentum distribution should necessarily be sub - keplerian .",
    "also , such flow is expected to possess ab - initio non - zero value of the advective velocity along the equatorial plane of the flow .",
    "such a configuration may perhaps be better described by a quasi - spherical flow rather than a standard thin disc structure with radius dependent flow thickness .",
    "a conical wedge shaped geometrical configuration may be the appropriate description for the axisymmetric flow profile under consideration and such geometry may be a better alternative of the flow in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction ( hereafter flow in vertical equilibrium in brief ) .",
    "results obtained so far in the literature for inviscid axisymmetric black hole accretion in vertical equilibrium are , thus , to be compared with the results obtained using a more general theoretical set up capable of studying various features of the low angular momentum inviscid axisymmetric accretion in all three different flow geometries usually considered in the relevant literature , viz . , accretion flow with constant thickness , conical wedge shaped flow , and accretion in vertical equilibrium ( ref @xcite and references therein ) . in most of the works dealing with the multi - transonic accretion flow deal with the stationary integral flow solutions .",
    "transient phenomena are , however , not quite rare in large scale astrophysical set up .",
    "hence , it is important to establish that the information obtained from the stationary solutions are reliable by ensuring that the steady states are stable for black hole accretion - at least for astrophysically relevant time scales .",
    "such a task may be accomplished by perturbing the set of equations describing the steady state accretion flow and by demonstrating that such perturbations do not diverge with time . for the pseudo - schwarzschild black hole accretion",
    ", it has recently been argued @xcite that the stationary inviscid flow described by a barotropic equation of state , are stable under linear perturbation of the mass accretion rate .",
    "such observations remain valid for all three geometrical flow configurations described in previous paragraphs .",
    "existence of certain mapping of the stationary transonic astrophysical flows ( in strong gravity ) with certain aspects of the analogue gravity ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a comprehensive discussion about the analogue gravity phenomena in general ) has recently been established @xcite for pseudo - schwarzschild axisymmetric accretion onto a non - rotating black hole for different geometric profiles of the accreting matter .",
    "the corresponding acoustic geometry was realized by studying the transonic properties of the stationary accretion solutions , and the numerical value of the associated acoustic surface gravity @xmath0 was estimated .",
    "off late , the conjecture that most ( if not all ) of the astrophysical black holes possess non - zero values of the spin angular momentum ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the kerr parameter ) has gained widespread acceptance @xcite .",
    "it is thus essential to understand how the black hole spin influences the salient features of the multi - transonic stationary integral flow solutions as well as to check whether the linear perturbation scheme gets altered with the variation of @xmath2 . which , in turn , would highlight how the space - time structure of the associated acoustic geometry depends on the rotation of the black hole .",
    "complete general relativistic treatment to address such issues is indeed non - trivial .",
    "although the stationary multi - transonic solutions are possible to obtain for flows in the kerr metric @xcite , full space - time dependent stability analysis of the transonic solutions does not seem to be amenable within the framework of the general relativity , especially when attempts are made to provide a complete analytical solution .",
    "+ motivated by the aforementioned arguments , in the present work we study low angular momentum inviscid axisymmetric hydrodynamic accretion onto a rotating black hole using post - newtonian pseudo - kerr potentials .",
    "several such potentials are available in the literature @xcite . among all potentials proposed , we however , pick up the one introduced by artemova et .",
    "al @xcite since it has the algebraically simplest form .",
    "the primary aim behind the introduction of a pseudo - schwarzschild / kerr black hole potential is to compromise between the convenience of handing of a newtonian description of gravity and the space time structure described by complicated general relativistic calculations .",
    "introduction of such potentials should allow one to investigate the basic physical process which occur during the accretion phenomena within the framework of a newtonian construct , hereby avoiding the formal general relativistic description of the dynamics of the inflowing matter .",
    "the intrinsic simplicity of the algebraic presentation of a pseudo - potential is of paramount importance to let that potential qualify as the useful one .",
    "no particular pseudo - potential stands alone as a significantly superior one ( compared to the rest of such potentials ) to mimic all the properties of the full general relativistic kerr metric - especially while describing the dynamics of the multi - transonic flow - the potential with the simplest algebraic form will be of significant interest for the aforementioned purpose .",
    "+ the viscous transport of angular momentum is not taken into account in this paper .",
    "forty one years after the introduction of the standard disc model @xcite , exact modelling of viscous transonic accretion flow incorporating proper heating and cooling effects is still an arduous task .",
    "also , as will be demonstrated later in this work , construction of acoustic geometry becomes practically impossible for dissipative flow since the viscous effect may destroy the lorenz in variance .",
    "large radial ( advective ) velocity close to the horizon ensures that the viscous time is larger than the dynamical infall time scale .",
    "large radial velocity even at the larger distance is due to the fact that the rotational energy of the axisymmetric flow remains relatively low @xcite .",
    "aforementioned arguments indicate that the assumption of inviscid flow is not unjustified for low angular momentum flow with initial non - vanishing advective velocity profile .",
    "+ for large scale relativistic astrophysical flows , however , the effect of the viscosity and magnetic field may not always be neglected . as a consequence , dissipative mechanism ( through comptonization , bremsstrahlung or synchrotron processes ) may become significant to influence the overall flow dynamics and hence the flow may be subjected to the turbulent instabilities .",
    "non - linear perturbation may also be of considerable importance to determine the stability criteria of the flow .",
    "velikov - chandrasekhar @xcite and / or balbus - hawley @xcite type magneto - rotational instabilities may be observed close to the black hole event horizon .",
    "these additional complexities clearly bring the system to the risk of complete destruction of the lorenz symmetries and hence the analytical modelling of the flow profile as well as of the sonic geometry embedded into it becomes impossible - one has to take recourse to the large scale numerical simulation to handle such flow profile , which , clearly , is beyond the scope of this work . also to mention in this aspect that the axisymmetric configuration of the flow is assumed a - priori and",
    "no misaligned flow structure may be handled using the formalism presented in this paper .",
    "+ in what follows , we write down the euler and the continuity equation for matter inflow considered in this work .",
    "both polytropic and isothermal flow will be analyzed for three different geometric configurations of the flow .",
    "these two equations are then integrated to obtain the corresponding first integrals of motion for the respective flow configurations .",
    "the critical point conditions are derived and the parameter space ( spanned by various initial boundary conditions governing the flow ) for the multi - transonic accretion are identified .",
    "the regions of the parameter space for which a steady standing stock may form are determined . a linear eigenvalue scheme to identify the nature ( whether they are of saddle or of center type ) of the critical points is developed .",
    "such a scheme helps to understand the nature of the two dimensional mach number vs. radial distance phase portrait from an algebraic point of view - without explicitly evaluating the integral solutions of the governing flow equations .",
    "formation of stationary shock is discussed and the parameter sub - space corresponding to the shocked flow is identified .",
    "such a parameter sub - space for various flow configurations are compared to understand how the geometric configuration of accreting matter influences the shock formation mechanism .",
    "the spin dependence of the salient features of the multi - transonic shocked flow is investigated .",
    "+ once the properties of the stationary solutions are fully understood , a time dependent linear perturbation analysis of the stationary integral flow solutions is performed for a generic form of the pseudo - kerr black hole potential to check whether such perturbations remain non - divergent , to estimate the stability of the steady state accretion solutions .",
    "it is further demonstrated that a space time dependent acoustic metric can be constructed to describe the propagation of the aforementioned linear perturbation and the corresponding pseudo - riemannian sonic manifold is studied .",
    "finally , the black hole spin dependence of the corresponding acoustic surface gravity is studied in somewhat detail .",

    "+ one needs to solve the time independent part of the above two equations to obtain the stationary integral flow solution ( which is necessary to construct the corresponding phase portrait for the transonic accretion ) . the time independent euler and the continuity equations are examples of the homogeneous differential equation of first order in flow velocity .",
    "integral solutions of such differential equations usually provide the corresponding first integrals of motion , - i.e. , the quantities which remain conserved .",
    "+ for axisymmetric inviscid",
    "hydrodynamic accretion we thus have two first integrals of motion obtained by integrating the euler and the continuity equations .",
    "+ since the continuity equation implies the conservation of mass , the corresponding first integral of motion - irrespective of the equation of state is used to describe the flow .",
    "the integral solution of the euler equation will provide the total specific energy as another first integral of motion for a polytropic flow .",
    "+ for isothermal accretion , the corresponding first integral of motion is not to be identified with the specific energy since energy exchange is allowed for such flow to maintain the space invariance of the bulk temperature of the flow . + the mass accretion rate , as we will observe , will be a function of the flow thickness , and will resume different values for three different geometric configurations of accretion . on the other hand , the first integral of motion obtained from the euler equation",
    "does not depend on the flow geometry - it rather depends on the equation of state ( though the integration of the term @xmath33 contained in the euler equation ) .",
