    "this paper is motivated by so - called `` topological bounds '' on the chromatic number of a graph : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is a `` hom - complex '' which can be viewed both as a @xmath2-poset and as the geometric realisation of its order complex .",

    "the cone construction allows us to define classes of `` generalised mycielski graphs '' inductively : let @xmath100 , and for @xmath101 , put @xmath102    [ coind = mycielski ] for any graph @xmath6 , @xmath4 is the largest @xmath103 such that there exist a @xmath104 admitting a homomorphism to @xmath6 .",
    "the complex used in  @xcite was the box complex @xmath105 rather than the hom - complex @xmath1 .",
    "however the two complexes are @xmath2-homotopy equivalent by a result of csorba  @xcite .",
    "for reference it is worthwhile to give a sketch of the proof here . in view of lemma  [ coind = mycielski ] , our hypothesis implies the existence of a homomorphism @xmath107 .",
    "we will write @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "( note that @xmath110 except when @xmath111 ; @xmath112 is the image of the apex of @xmath113 for any @xmath114 . )",
    "we will show that the homomorphism @xmath23 defined by @xmath115 satisfies @xmath37 .",
    "consider the expressions @xmath116 in @xmath40 given by @xmath117 we then have @xmath118 in particular , @xmath119 simplifies to @xmath47 , since @xmath120 is the constant image of the apex of @xmath113 .",
    "also , by definition of @xmath13 , for @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "therefore @xmath124 this is the image @xmath125 of @xmath126 under the ( well - defined ) automorphism @xmath127 of @xmath40 which interchanges @xmath128 with @xmath129 for all @xmath130 . therefore if @xmath131 , then @xmath132 and @xmath133 , since @xmath134 and @xmath126 are conjugates",
    "therefore , @xmath135 for all @xmath136 .",
    "again by definition of @xmath13 , we then have @xmath137    it would be nice to be able to reverse the arguments of this proof to prove the second direction . that is , start with @xmath23 such that @xmath37 , and use the definition of @xmath13 to extend it to a homomorphism @xmath107 .",
    "however an example in  @xcite shows that this is not always possible ; @xmath106 may be to small as a base .",
    "thus we need to start from the basic information provided by the equation @xmath37 . since @xmath138 this means that in @xmath139 , @xmath32 is equal to a product @xmath140 of conjugates of the relations @xmath141 defining @xmath13 .",
    "the first difficulty here is that there is a useful feature common to @xmath32 and the generators @xmath141 of @xmath13 , which is lost in the expression @xmath142 : the fact that words alternate in forward arcs and inverses of backward arcs along a walk in @xmath6 .",
    "this feature provides a natural connection between algebraic expressions and path homomorphisms . for this reason",
    ", we will fix a root vertex @xmath143 in @xmath6 , and associate to each arc @xmath128 a closed walk from @xmath143 through @xmath128 , called a `` loop '' . the use of loops will transform @xmath142 into a word which is much longer , but which has the desired alternating property .",
    "we will identify this word with an expression of the type @xmath144 defining homomorphic images of two consecutive levels of some @xmath145 .",
    "we will then extend this homomorphism to the apex of @xmath145 using the definition of @xmath13 , and towards its base using the simplification of @xmath142 to @xmath32 .",
    "our basic tool to convert algebraic simplifications to homomorphism extensions is the extension along `` bricks '' , that is , essentially rectangular pieces that dissect @xmath145 .",
    "most of our work will be done in the free monoid @xmath146 generated by @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is a set of symbols disjoint from @xmath7 .",
    "of course , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the congruence which identifies @xmath151 and @xmath152 to @xmath47 for all @xmath153 .",
    "however , for a suitable correspondence between words and walks , it is sometimes useful to avoid this identification .",
    "a walk @xmath154 in @xmath6 is the image of a homomorphism @xmath25 of some path with vertices @xmath155 linked consecutively .",
    "to such a walk we can associate a word @xmath156 ending in @xmath157 or @xmath158 depending on whether @xmath22 is odd or even .",
    "this word alternates symbols from @xmath7 and symbols from @xmath159 , with the symbol following @xmath160 being @xmath161 for some @xmath162 , and the symbol following @xmath163 being @xmath160 for some @xmath164 .",
    "conversely , a word with these properties naturally corresponds to a walk in @xmath6 .",
    "now for our purposes we can assume that @xmath6 is connected and nonbipartite , if necessary by restricting our attention to the component of @xmath6 that contains an odd cycle with trivial signature .",
    "we fix a root vertex @xmath143 and for every vertex @xmath165 of @xmath6 , we fix an even path @xmath166 and an odd path @xmath167 , both from @xmath143 to @xmath165 . for an arc @xmath9 of @xmath6 , we define the loop @xmath168 corresponding to @xmath9 by @xmath169 of course , @xmath170 means @xmath171 , though this needs to be stated formally since inversion does not exist in @xmath146 . with this notation , we define @xmath172 as @xmath173 .",
    "the loop function naturally extends to @xmath146 by putting @xmath174 .",
    "the map @xmath175 is an endomorphism whose image consists of words corresponding to even closed walks rooted at @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath176      now let @xmath177 be an odd cycle and @xmath178 a homomorphism such that @xmath37 .",
    "for our purposes , it is useful to assume that for @xmath179 , we have @xmath180 .",
    "this can be done without loss of generality , since if @xmath181 , then we can remove @xmath182 and identify @xmath183 and @xmath184 to create a copy of @xmath185 on which @xmath25 induces a homomorphism @xmath186 .",
    "we then have @xmath187 , since @xmath188 is obtained from @xmath32 by cancelling out @xmath189 with @xmath190 and @xmath191 with @xmath192 ( unless @xmath193 , in which case we get a conjugation of the identity element instead of the second cancellation ) .",
    "we begin by lifting the condition @xmath37 from @xmath194 to @xmath195 : by definition , this means that there exists a sequence @xmath196 of generators of @xmath13 and a sequence @xmath197 of conjugating elements such that @xmath198 note that the left side is reduced in @xmath195 , since @xmath199 for all @xmath200 .",
    "this means that the right side simplifies to the left , by repeatedly cancelling out adjacent terms that are inverse of each other .",
    "we view the terms in this equation as elements of @xmath146 ( that is , as their simplest preimage under @xmath150 ) . in this way the terms @xmath201 and @xmath202 are well defined .",
    "now consider the word @xmath203 its length is a multiple of @xmath5 , since for each @xmath182 , the length of @xmath204 is a multiple of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore for any neighbour @xmath205 of @xmath143 , the word @xmath206 has length equal to @xmath207 for some odd @xmath22 .",
    "we then have @xmath208 for some closed walk @xmath209 .",
    "we identify the domain of @xmath209 with the @xmath207-cycle @xmath210 , whose vertices correspond to two consecutive levels of some @xmath113 .",
    "we will show such that it is possible to choose @xmath93 and the correspondence such that @xmath209 extends to a homorphism of @xmath113 to @xmath6 .",
    "for integers @xmath182 and @xmath211 , the bricks @xmath212 and @xmath213 are the graphs defined by @xmath214 : |x - x'| = 1 , |y - y'| = 1 \\};\\\\ v(b_{\\mbox{d}}(i , j ) ) & = & \\ { ( x , y ) : 0 \\leq x \\leq i , 0 \\leq y \\leq j , \\mbox { $ x$ and $ y$ have different parities } \\ } , \\\\ e(b_{\\mbox{d}}(i ,",

    "the sets of vertices of @xmath212 and @xmath215 with second coordinate @xmath46 are called the _ lower side _ of @xmath212 and @xmath215 , and similarly , their _ upper _ , _ left _ , and _ right _",
    "sides are defined by obvious conditions .",
    "* for any @xmath221 , the map @xmath222 defined by @xmath223 is a homomorphism of @xmath224 to @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , for any @xmath221 , the map @xmath225 defined by @xmath226 is a homomorphism of @xmath227 to @xmath6 . * if @xmath228 for @xmath229",
    ", then there exists a homomorphism @xmath230 extending @xmath231 such that @xmath222 is identically equal to @xmath232 on the left , upper and right sides of @xmath233 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath234 for @xmath229 , then there exists a homomorphism @xmath235 extending @xmath231 such that @xmath222 is identically equal to @xmath236 on the left , upper and right sides of @xmath237 .    item ( i ) is straightforward . to prove the first part of item ( ii ) , we note that the distance between two vertices @xmath128 , @xmath238 of @xmath224 is the `` bus distance '' @xmath239 .",
    "therefore the map @xmath230 defined by @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is at the same distance as @xmath128 from @xmath242 , is a homomorphism with the prescribed properties .",
    "the second part is proved similarly .",
    "we apply lemma  [ extension ] to extend the homomorphism @xmath243 towards the apex of some @xmath113 .",
    "consider the restrictions @xmath244 of @xmath209 such that @xmath245 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath182 , we further decompose @xmath246 into five restrictions @xmath247 such that @xmath248      by lemma  [ extension ] ( ii ) , @xmath249 extends to a homomorphism @xmath250 of some @xmath251 to @xmath6 ( @xmath252 being the length of @xmath253 ) , which is identically equal to @xmath254 on its left , upper and right sides . similarly @xmath255 and @xmath256 extend to @xmath257 and @xmath258 , which are identically equal to @xmath259 and @xmath260 respectively on their left , upper and right sides .",
    "moreover , the extensions @xmath261 of @xmath262 to @xmath263 can be carried simultaneously side by side , since @xmath254 is adjacent to @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "we then add one level to @xmath264 and extend @xmath250 by mapping the new level to @xmath259 , and add two levels to each of @xmath265 and @xmath266 and extend @xmath257 and @xmath258 by mapping the new levels to @xmath254 and @xmath259 respectively .",
    "we then use lemma  [ extension ] ( i ) on the top two levels of @xmath267 and @xmath268 to add levels and equalize their heights if necessary .",
    "we can then use lemma  [ extension ] ( i ) to extend @xmath269 and @xmath270 upwards to match the height of @xmath271 and @xmath266 .",
    "we have thus extended @xmath246 to @xmath272 such that the restriction @xmath273 of @xmath274 to the top two levels of @xmath275 satisfies @xmath276 for some @xmath277 ( see figure  [ extensionfig ] ) . using lemma  [ extension ] ( ii ) , we extend @xmath273 to @xmath278 which is identically @xmath143 on the left , top and right sides of @xmath279 .",
    "these extensions of @xmath246 to @xmath274 and @xmath280 can be carried simultaneously for @xmath281 , since they all have the value @xmath143 at their common boundaries .",
    "we can then use lemma  [ extension ] ( i ) to equalize heights , and bring up the part of @xmath209 corresponding to @xmath282 to the same height .",
    "since the value of the extensions is identically @xmath143 at the top level , we can identify all the vertices of this top level .",
    "we have extended @xmath209 to the apex of some @xmath113 .",
    "the extension of @xmath209 towards the base of @xmath113 is a second extension independent from the extension to the apex .",
    "it again uses lemma  [ extension ] , thus we keep the terminology of extending in the `` upper '' direction .",
    "the two extensions will afterwards be merged together by identifying their bottom level .    in @xmath195 , the word @xmath283 of @xmath146",
    "simplifies to @xmath284 specifically , this means that there exists a sequence of basic simplifications of @xmath283 eliminating everything but the terms of @xmath32 . in each of these basic simplification , some term @xmath285 will cancel out either with the next term @xmath286 , or with a further term @xmath287 , where all the intermediate terms @xmath288 have been previously simplified .    in @xmath289 ,",
    "a term @xmath290 is replaced by @xmath291 .",

    ", it extends to a homomorphism of some @xmath293 to @xmath6 with value identically @xmath143 on its left , upper and right sides .",
    "we can then add a level with value identically @xmath205 , and use lemma  [ extension ] ( i ) to bring up the remainder of the extension of @xmath209 to the same level .",
    "in this way , we match each step in the simplification of @xmath283 to a corresponding step in the extension .",
    "we end up with an extension where the two upper levels correspond to a word with the terms @xmath294 and @xmath295 separated by terms of the form @xmath296 .    now in this word , between @xmath297 and @xmath298 is a word of the form @xmath299 . by lemma  [ extension ] ( ii ) , it extends to a homomorphism of some brick to @xmath6 with value identically @xmath300 on its left , upper and right sides . we can then add a level with value identically @xmath301 .",

    "more precisely , @xmath310 , where @xmath311 is a homomorphism .",

    "this corresponds to adding two levels to match the operation .",
    "that is , the extension on the two new levels is identical to the extension on the previous two levels , except that value at the vertex corresponding to @xmath328 switches from one term in @xmath329 to the other .    proceeding this way",
    ", we can move the labels around in any way we please .",
    "in particular we can rearrange the labels until there are @xmath330 `` @xmath318 '' labels followed by @xmath331 `` @xmath53 '' labels , then by @xmath330 `` @xmath318 '' labels and @xmath331 `` @xmath53 '' labels . in this way ,",
