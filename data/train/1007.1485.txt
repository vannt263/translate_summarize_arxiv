    "in spite of extensive theoretical efforts undertaken to reproduce the characteristics of the sagittarius ( sgr ) stream ( e.g. ibata et al . 2001 ; martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2004 ; helmi 2004 ; law et al .",
    "2005 , 2010 ; fellhauer et al . 2006 ) , there is presently no theoretical model that fully explains the wealth of available observational data .",
    "two aspects of the stream have proved particularly challenging to model .",
    "first , the leading tail of the sgr stream is bifurcated , with both arms exhibiting similar distances , velocities and metallicity distributions ( yanny et al . 2009 ; niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "2010 ) , which would appear to refute an earlier model explaining the bifurcation as two wraps of different ages ( fellhauer et al .",
    "2006 ) , or as independent streams from different progenitors .",
    "second , the position on the sky of the stream suggests that the milky way ( mw ) dark matter halo interior to the stream has an oblate or perhaps a nearly spherical shape ( johnston et al . 2005 ; fellhauer et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the heliocentric velocities of stream members support a prolate shape ( helmi 2004 ) .",
    "in a recent work , law & majewski ( 2010 ) ( hereafter lm10 ) have shown that what appears as mutually exclusive results may in fact signal the possibility of the halo being triaxial in shape , as cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological models predict ( e.g. kazantzidis et al.2010 and references therein ) .",
    "however , lm10 find that in order to reproduce the location and velocities of the stream the intermediate axis of the dark matter halo should be aligned with the spin vector of the mw disc .",
    "this is hard to understand as circular orbits about the intermediate axis are unstable ( e.g. adams et al .",
    "2007 ) , raising questions as to the formation of the galactic disc . furthermore",
    ", this model does not attempt to explain the origin of the stream bifurcation .    interestingly , the chemical composition of sgr clearly stands out from the rest of mw dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) .",
    "first , strong metallicity gradients ( @xmath2 } { \\mbox{$\\,\\mathrel{\\mathpalette{\\protect{\\mbox{\\lower0.5ex\\vbox {    \\baselineskip=0pt\\lineskip=0.2ex     \\ialign{$\\mathsurround=0pt < \\hfil##\\hfil$\\crcr}\\crcr\\sim\\crcr}}}}}\\,$}}0.0 $ ] ) , unsual in other dwarfs , have been reported in the remnant core ( giuffrida et al.2010 ) , which also extends to the tidal tails ( chou et al .",
    "2007 ; monaco et al . 2007",
    "; keller et al . 2010 )",
    ". also , recent analysis of the chemical abundances in the core and tails of sgr suggest that this galaxy underwent an enrichment history more akin to lmc than to other dsphs ( sbordone et al . 2007 ; chou et al . 2010 ) .    motivated by the above results , here we explore the possibility that the sgr dwarf was originally a late - type , rotating disc galaxy , rather than a pressure - supported dsph .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine how rotation affects the properties of the associated tidal stream , and to provide model predictions that yield unambiguous tests for this scenario , rather than reproducing all of the well - documented properties of the sgr stream in detail .",
    "the mw disc is assumed to follow a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) model with a mass @xmath3 , and radial and vertical scale lengths @xmath4 kpc and @xmath5 kpc .",
    "the mw bulge follows a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile with a mass @xmath6 and a scale radius @xmath7 kpc .",
    "the mw dark matter halo is modelled as a nfw profile with a virial mass @xmath8 , virial radius @xmath9 kpc and concentration @xmath10 ( klypin et al .",
    "following lm10 , we assume that the halo is triaxial in shape by introducing elliptical coordinates with the substitution @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are dimensionless quantities .",
    "following the results of lm10 , we choose the density axis - ratios to be @xmath14 .",
    "the best - fitting models of lm10 also suggest that the sun does not sit on one of the principal axis of the halo , but rather slightly off the x ( i.e. minor)-axis , @xmath15,\\sin[\\lambda])$ ] , where @xmath16 .",
    "we hold the halo parameters fixed through the evolution of our sgr models for simplicity given that tidal streams are barely sensitive to the past evolution of the host potential ( pearrubia et al .",
    "our analysis also neglects the effects of dynamical friction on the orbit of sgr . however , dynamical friction is unlikely to introduce a strong orbital decay during the time - scale of interest ( i.e. the last 23 gyr , see fig . 5 of pearrubia et al .",
    "2006 )    the current position of sgr and its line - of - sight velocity in the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) frame are @xmath17 and @xmath18 km s@xmath1 , respectively ( ibata et al . 1997 ) . to derive the orbit of sgr in the above potential , we adopt the proper motion estimates of dinescu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who find @xmath19 mas / yr . using the standard solar motion about the mw centre from binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) , this translates into a space motion of @xmath20 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we use test particles to integrate its orbit back in time for a few orbital periods in order to provide initial conditions for our n - body realizations of the sgr dwarf .",
    "we find that its orbital peri- and apocentres in the above potential are 15 and 67 kpc , respectively , which implies an orbital period of 1.04 gyr .",
    "currently , sgr has just ( @xmath21 myr ago ) gone through its last pericentric passage , and will cross the milky way disc in approximately 28 myr .",
    "we use the algorithm buildgal to construct n - body realizations of late - type spirals composed of a baryonic disc and a dark matter halo ( see hernquist 1993 for a detailed description ) .",
    "the disc profile is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the disc mass , @xmath24 is the vertical thickness , and @xmath25 the radial scale - length . in our models we assume that @xmath26 .",
    "we adopt a non - singular isothermal profile for the dark matter halo @xmath27}{r^2 + r_c^2 } ; \\label{eq : halo}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the halo mass , @xmath29 is the core radius and @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the properties of the sgr stream model are not particularly sensitive to the value of the core radius . here",
    "we choose @xmath31 .",
    "we use the results of nierderste - ostholt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to crudely derive a fiducial mass for each of the components of our sgr n - body models .",
    "these authors estimate that prior to stellar stripping sgr had a total luminosity of @xmath32 , of which only @xmath33@xmath34 remains currently bound in the remnant core . in order to convert n - body masses into luminosities we adopt a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath35 ( note , however that the strong metallicity gradients measured throughout the sgr core may indicate a large range of @xmath36 ) . under this choice",
    "the initial sgr disc mass thus is @xmath37 . adopting a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath38 , typical for dwarf galaxies with @xmath39 ( mateo 1998 )",
    ", we have @xmath40 .",
    "the total initial mass of our sgr model therefore is @xmath41 .",
    "also , since we only simulate the most recent history of the sgr dwarf , our initial conditions must account for the fact that the outer halo envelope may have already been lost to tides at the time when the stellar stream begins to form ( see pearrubia et al .",
    "2008 ) . to do this",
    "we impose a truncation in the dark matter density profile at @xmath42 , which roughly corresponds to the tidal radius of a satellite galaxy with mass @xmath43 at a pericentre @xmath44 kpc .",
    "the only remaining free parameter is the initial scale - length of our sgr n - body models , @xmath25 .",
    "we fix its value by demanding the bound remnants of the sgr model to contain @xmath45% of its initial stellar mass at the final snap - shot of the simulation .",
    "indeed , under this definition the value of @xmath25 depends on the number of orbital periods for which we follow the evolution of the sgr dwarf .",
    "adopting an integration time of 2.5 orbital periods ( see  [ sec : results ] ) , this condition yields @xmath46 kpc . under this choice of model parameters ,",
    "the peak rotation velocity of sgr is 43 km s@xmath1 at @xmath47 kpc , which are indeed typical values for late - type spirals with luminosities @xmath32 ( e.g. swaters et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we follow the evolution of the sgr n - body model in the galaxy potential using superbox , a highly efficient particle - mesh gravity code ( see fellhauer et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "superbox uses three nested grid zones centered on the highest - density particle cell of the dwarf .",
    "each grid has @xmath48 cubic cells : ( i ) the inner grid has a spacing of @xmath49 and is meant to resolve the innermost region of the satellite galaxy .",
    "( ii ) the middle grid extends to cover the whole dwarf , with spacing @xmath50 .",
    "( iii ) the outermost grid extends out to @xmath51 and is meant to follow particles that are stripped from the dwarf .",
    "we choose a constant time - step @xmath52 myr , which leads to a total energy conservation better than 1% after the dwarf models are evolved for a hubble time in isolation .",
    "this shows that the evolution of the n - body model is free from artefacts induced by finite spatial and time resolutions .",
    "the angle subtended by the internal angular momentum vector of sgr and that of its orbit about the mw , i.e. @xmath53 $ ] is a free parameter in our study .",
    "the orientation of the sgr disc is set at the start of the simulation by rotating @xmath54 an angle @xmath55 about the instantaneous line of the orbit . under this definition",
    ", @xmath56 denotes a model where the spin vector of the sgr disc and the normal vector of the orbital plane are perfectly aligned , whilst @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively indicate models where sgr rotates in a prograde and retrograde motion with respect to its galactic orbit .",
    "[ fig : fof_6 ] shows the projection on the `` field of streams '' area of the sky ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) of sgr stellar debris for different disc orientations after integrating our n - body models for 2.5 orbital periods . for simplicity",
    ", we show only particles that belong to the leading tail of the sgr stream , given that the trailing tail has not been detected yet in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "this figure illustrates a few interesting points .",
    "the first is during the stripping process a fraction of the internal angular momentum of sgr transfers to the stream . as a result , the stream tail(s )",
    "do not trace the progenitor s orbit ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fof_6 ] ) . in practical terms , our results suggest that internal rotation in the progenitor of the sgr stream may have to be taken into account when inferring the shape of the mw halo from fitting the position and velocity of stream pieces .",
    "a second interesting point is that bifurcations in the leading tail of the sgr stream naturally appear in this area of the sky if the spin vector and the normal vector of the orbital plane are misaligned .",
    "the separation between the bifurcated arms clearly becomes more prominent as the value of @xmath59 increases .",
    "interestingly , by colour - coding the stellar particles according to their heliocentric distances , we can appreciate that in all models both arms show a very similar gradient throughout the sky , in concordance with observational data ( belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ; niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "hence , internal rotation in the sgr dwarf mainly affects the apparent precesion of the stream plane on the sky .",
    "the model with @xmath60 has a striking resemblance with the field of streams .",
    "it also provides a reasonable match to most of the existing observational constraints .",
    "[ fig : model ] shows the projected location ( _ upper panel _ ) , heliocentric distance ( _ middle panel _ ) and line - of - sight velocity ( _ lower panel _ ) of the leading ( open symbols ) and trailing ( closed symbols ) tail particles of a sgr stream model with initial orientation @xmath60 . by colour - coding the particles according to the time at which they are stripped",
    ", we can appreciate that the bifurcation arises from material lost at consecutive pericentric passages .",
    "in particular , the southern , more prominent tail of the leading arm ( stream a ) corresponds to stars that were lost at the third most recent pericentric interaction , i.e. @xmath61 gyr ago ( coloured in red ) , whilst the fainter northern tail ( stream b ) is more recent and is composed of stars that became unbound at the penultimate pericentre , i.e. @xmath62 gyr ago ( in blue ) .",
    "this result clearly implies that the minimum age of the sgr stream is two orbital periods , which justifies the choice of integration time for our n - body models .",
    "this model correctly reproduces the distances and velocities measured along streams a and b , as well as the recent detections of the trailing tail in the southern hemisphere .",
    "puzzlingly , although also predicted by our model , the presence of the trailing tail in the field of streams has thus far eluded detection .",
    "this may be explained by the drop of stars expected beyond the apocentre of the trailing tail , i.e. r.a.@xmath63 , as well as the sharp increase in distance at r.a.@xmath64 , which may both conspire to put the surface brightness and the turn - off apparent magnitude of the stream beyond the detection threshold of current photometric surveys .    .",
    "particles are colour - coded according to the dwarf surface brightness at their location ( _ upper panel _ ) and mean line - of - sight velocity ( _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "symbols denote the location of the fields spectroscopically surveyed by ibata et al .",
    "note that our models predict that the remnant core still rotates with a velocity amplitude @xmath0 km s@xmath1.,width=317 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : core ] suggests that further clues on the nature of the sgr dwarf may be gained by studying its remnant core . in the upper panel",
    ", we show the projection onto the sky of the sgr dwarf model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "particles are colour - coded according to the dwarf surface brightness at their location .",
    "the core morphology agrees well with that derived from the 2mass survey ( see e.g. fig . 4 of majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) , although its central surface brightness is somewhat brighter than estimated by these authors ( @xmath65mag/@xmath66 ) .",
    "mismatches in surface brightness , however , may be a consequence of adopting a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio for our n - body particles .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : core ] shows that , although tidal mass stripping removes a large fraction of the original angular momentum in the progenitor sgr disc , the remnant core is predicted to rotate with a velocity amplitude @xmath0 km s@xmath1 , which translates into a net velocity difference of @xmath67 km s@xmath1 between stars at declinations above and below @xmath68 . although not shown here , the central line of sight velocity dispersion is @xmath69 km s@xmath1 , in reasonable agreement with the estimates of bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who find a uniformly flat profile at @xmath70 km s@xmath1 over the central @xmath71 range .",
    "the only available kinematic survey throughout the sgr dwarf dates back to ibata et al .",
    "these authors measured a line - of - sight velocity between 160170 km s@xmath1 in most of their pencil - beam fields , hence with little or no evidence of net rotation .",
    "although in these locations our model accurately reproduces their velocity measurements , fig .",
    "[ fig : core ] suggests that ibata et al .",
    "fields were too sparsely sampled to pick up the rotation signal predicted by our models .",
    "here , we explored the possibility that the sgr was originally a late - type , rotating disc galaxy .",
    "we show that bifurcations in the leading tail of the sgr stream , similar to those detected by the sdss survey , naturally arise in models where the disc is misaligned with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "this occurs because material is primarily stripped at pericentric passages , and successive passages occur at different orientations of the sgr disc .",
    "together with observed metallicity patterns that are atypical for dwarf spheroidal galaxies , this suggests that the sgr dwarf may have originally been a galaxy akin to late - type spirals with a peak rotation of @xmath72 kms@xmath1 .",
    "we also find that internal rotation alters the position of the stream with respect the sgr orbit , which might indirectly affect any constraint on the shape of the mw halo derived from pressure - supported dwarf models .",
    "fortunately , before we embark upon more complex modelling of the sgr stream , there is a clear - cut way to test whether the sgr dwarf was indeed a rotating galaxy .",
    "although tidal stripping efficiently removes angular momentum from the progenitor dwarf , we find that the remnant core should still rotate with a velocity amplitude close to @xmath0 kms@xmath1 given the current estimates of the fraction of light residing in the tidal stream . validating this prediction is feasible with existing instruments and will shed light on the true origin of the sgr dwarf , as well as on the shape of the mw dark matter halo .    0.5",
