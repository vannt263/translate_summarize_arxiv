    "gravitational effects on the light propagation provide powerful tools for investigating extrasolar planets , dark matter and dark energy in modern astronomy and cosmology .",
    "the effects are important also in theoretical physics particularly for studying a null structure of a spacetime .",
    "a rigorous form of the bending angle has been studied in understanding a strong gravitational field @xcite .",
    "for example , strong gravitational lensing in a schwarzschild black hole was considered by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite , by virbhadra and ellis @xcite and more comprehensively by virbhadra @xcite ; virbhadra , narasimha and chitre @xcite studied distinctive lensing features of naked singularities .",
    "virbhadra and ellis @xcite and virbhadra and keeton @xcite later described the strong gravitational lensing by naked singularities ; eiroa , romero and torres @xcite treated reissner - nordstrm black hole lensing ; perlick @xcite discussed the lensing by a barriola - vilenkin monopole and also that by an ellis wormhole @xcite , the latter of which had been discussed long before ( for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been investigated as an observational probe of violations of some energy conditions @xcite . there",
    "exist several forms of the deflection angle by the ellis wormhole @xcite .",
    "a reason for such differences has been clarified by several authors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , tsukamoto and his collaborators @xcite have investigated the lensing in tangherlini spacetime as an extension of schwarzschild one to arbitrary dimensions ; horvath , gergely , and hobill @xcite studied lensing effects with negative convergence by so - called tidal charges in the dadhich et al .",
    "solution @xcite , where , for a brane world black hole , the tidal charge arises from tidal forces acting at the brane - bulk boundary .",
    "note that negative convergence in this case does not require any exotic matter .",
    "it comes from the weyl curvature in higher dimensions .",
    "in addition , gibbons and kodama @xcite have shown that curvature - regular asymptotically flat solitons with negative mass are contained in the myers - perry family , although the soliton solutions in the odd spacetime dimensions might not correspond to astrophysical objects .",
    "kunz and her collaborators have constructed traversable wormholes in the dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory @xcite , in which they do not require any form of exotic matter for their existence .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study gravitational lenses for probing an exotic energy or new physics .",
    "furthermore , the arrival time delay of light in schwarzschild spacetime , which is called shapiro time delay , is another gravitational effect on light in a curved spacetime .",
    "the time delay effect has successfully tested the einstein s theory @xcite .",
    "a significant improvement was done by using doppler tracking of the cassini spacecraft on its way to the saturn @xcite .",
    "gravitational time delay in some modified gravity models has been discussed by assuming a small perturbation around the schwarzschild spacetime in the weak field approximation @xcite ; virbhadra and keeton @xcite and deandrea and alexander @xcite have discussed time delay by naked singularities to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "time delay by strongly naked singularities are negative , where strongly naked singularities are those that are not covered by any photon sphere .    therefore , it will be interesting to study the time delay of light for understanding of other exotic lens models .",
    "furthermore , the frequency shift is caused by a change of the time delay with time , if the emitter of light moves .",
    "note that this frequency shift is different from the gravitational redshift due to a difference between clocks at two places .",
    "see figure [ figure-1 ] , in which the frequency shift is caused by the time delay of each signal . actually , it is the frequency shift by the gravitational time delay that was measured by the cassini spacecraft experiment @xcite .",
    "hence , the present paper will study both the arrival time delay and the induced frequency shift .",
    "in particular , we reexamine the spacetime model that has been discussed by kitamura et al .",
    "@xcite to study exotic gravitational lensing effects .",
    "this spacetime metric depends on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0 in the weak field approximation .",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime and the ellis wormhole correspond to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , so that these spacetimes can be expressed as a one - parameter family .",
    "this one - parameter model expresses a spherical mass distribution that may be related with violations of some energy conditions for a certain parameter region .",
    "note that birkhoff s theorem could say that cases @xmath3 might be non - vacuum , if the models were interpreted in the framework of the standard einstein equation .",
    "this lens model has suggested possible demagnification of lensed images @xcite , radial shear @xcite , and an anomaly in centroid motions of images @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly summarizes the basics of the inverse - power lens models @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss time delay and frequency shift in the modified spacetime .",
    "possible parameter ranges relevant to pulsar timings also are studied .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusion .",
    "the present paper follows kitamura et al .",
    "@xcite , which assumes that an asymptotically flat , static and spherically symmetric modified spacetime could depend on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0 in the weak field approximation .",
    "we consider the light propagation through a four - dimensional spacetime , though the whole spacetime may be higher dimensional .",
    "the four - dimensional spacetime metric is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the circumference radius and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are small book - keeping parameters in iterative calculations .",
    "this model under study might describe a regular distribution of matter for @xmath3 ( see @xcite on this point ) .",
    "the weak - field approximation means @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "namely , we study a far field from the lens object as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) is not valid in the strong field near @xmath12 ( please see a note in @xcite for more detail ) . here",
    ", @xmath6 and @xmath7 may be either positive or negative , respectively .",
    "negative @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath1 correspond to a negative mass ( in the linearized schwarzschild metric ) .    without loss of generality",
    ", we focus on the equatorial plane @xmath13 , since the spacetime is spherically symmetric .",
    "the deflection angle of light becomes at the linear order @xcite @xmath14 where the integral is positive definite , @xmath15 denotes the impact parameter of the light ray , we denote @xmath16 , and we define @xmath17 by @xmath18 for the closest approach @xmath19 . by absorbing the positive integral into the parameter @xmath20 , we rewrite the linear - order deflection angle simply as @xmath21 , where the sign of @xmath22 is the same as that of @xmath20 .",
    "this deflection angle recovers the schwarzschild ( @xmath1 ) and ellis wormhole ( @xmath2 ) cases .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to positive deflection of light and negative one , respectively .",
    "hence , let us call them a gravitational convex lens and a gravitational concave one , respectively .",
    "it is unlikely that there exists any photon sphere in the concave model .",
    "for instance , see eq .",
    "( 7 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , which suggests @xmath25 for the existence of a photon sphere .",
    "we mention an effective mass .",
    "a simple application of the standard lens theory @xcite suggests that the deflection angle of light in the form of @xmath21 corresponds to a convergence ( scaled surface mass density ) as @xmath26 which implies an extended spherical distribution of matter ( or energy ) for @xmath3 and a singular source only for @xmath27 .    for the weak - field schwarzschild case ( @xmath27 )",
    ", it follows that the convergence vanishes . if @xmath23 and @xmath28 , or if @xmath24 and @xmath29 , the effective surface mass density of the lens object is interpreted as negative in the framework of the standard lens theory @xcite . for these two cases ,",
    "the matter ( and energy ) need to be exotic . if @xmath24 and @xmath28 , or if @xmath23 and @xmath29 , on the other hand , the convergence is positive almost everywhere except for the central singularity and hence exotic matter ( and energy ) are not required in the framework of the standard lens theory , in spite of the gravitational repulsion on light rays .",
    "note that convex lenses ( @xmath23 ) and concave ones ( @xmath24 ) in the above two - parameter models do not have a one - to - one correspondence to positive convergence @xmath30 and negative one @xmath31 .",
    "by using @xmath32 for a light signal , we obtain the orbit equation as @xmath33   + o(\\varepsilon_1 ^ 2 , \\varepsilon_2 ^ 2 , \\varepsilon_1 \\varepsilon_2 ) , \\label{orbit}\\ ] ] where the impact parameter @xmath15 is related with the closest approach @xmath19 as @xmath34 the time - of - flight of a photon from the source ( denoted by @xmath35 ) to the receiver ( denoted by @xmath36 ) becomes @xmath37 where we define @xmath38 .",
    "see figure [ figure-2 ] for the photon path .    subtracting the time in the flat spacetime from it provides the time delay at the linear order as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to the direction from the lens to the receiver and that to the source of light , respectively .    for general @xmath0 , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ delay ] ) is not always expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "hence , numerical computations are required for eq .",
    "( [ delay ] ) .",

    "( [ delay ] ) becomes @xmath42 + \\tilde{\\varepsilon}\\left [ 2\\ln\\dfrac{(r_r+x_r)(r_s+x_s)}{r_0 ^ 2}\\right ] ,   \\label{delay - n1}\\ ] ] which agrees with the shapiro delay formula if @xmath43 equals to schwarzschild radius .",
    "here , we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath46    next , we consider the case of an even integer ( @xmath47 ) , where @xmath48 is a positive integer . then , we obtain @xmath49 where the subscript @xmath50 indicates the case of @xmath47 and @xmath51 means @xmath52 .",
    "next , let us consider the case of @xmath53 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath54    up to this point , integrations have been done without any approximation . for astronomical situations ,",
    "the closest distance of light is much shorter than the distance from the lens to the source and that from the lens to the observer , so that we can take the limit as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so that the above expressions can be simplified .",

    "( [ delay - neven - limit ] ) and ( [ delay - nodd - limit ] ) suggest that the time delay @xmath61 is proportional to @xmath62 and also to @xmath63 , if @xmath64 and @xmath65 are large .",

    "figure [ figure-4 ] shows curves for positive time delays for @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ figure-5 ] corresponds to negative delays for @xmath75 .",
    "next , we consider the frequency shift caused by the time delay . in most astronomical situations",
    ", observers can not know the exact time of the emission of light .",
    "hence , the arrival time delay can not be measured directly for a single image , although the arrival time difference between multiple images ( e.g. distant quasars ) are astronomical observables @xcite .",
    "note that the round - trip time of a light signal is a direct observable for a spacecraft such as voyager and cassini . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency shift induced by the time delay becomes a direct observable , if the emitter of a light signal moves with respect to the lens object @xcite .",
    "the frequency shift @xmath76 due to the time delay is defined as @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the intrinsic frequency of light and @xmath79 means the observed one at time @xmath80 . as figure [ figure-1 ] suggests , @xmath81 if the emitter of light approaches the lens and @xmath82 if it recedes . in general , the expression for @xmath76 may become lengthy , though it is simplified for an integer @xmath0 .",

    ", the appropriate value of the parameter @xmath19 is chosen such that the peak location can remain the same with each other in order to enable us to see the behavior of @xmath76 .",
    "the timing shift curve falls off more rapidly as the parameter @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is because the gravitational potential decays faster as @xmath0 becomes larger ( see the spacetime metric in eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) ) .",
    "( [ y2p ] ) and ( [ y2p+1 ] ) suggest that @xmath87 for large @xmath88",
    ". see figure [ figure-7 ] for the @xmath24 case .",
    "there are two observables in time delay measurements .",
    "one is the amplitude of the time delay corresponding to the curve height in figures [ figure-4 ] and [ figure-6 ] , and the other is the duration corresponding to the curve width in figure [ figure-5 ] and [ figure-7 ] .",
    "( [ delay - neven - limit ] ) and ( [ delay - nodd - limit ] ) suggest that the size of the time delay is @xmath89 the duration of the time delay is roughly @xmath90 let us assume that @xmath68 is of the order of the typical rotational velocity in our galaxy , because there are no established theories on the motion of the exotic lens .",
    "the current pulsar timing measurements are done a few times per year for each pulsar .",
    "th root - mean - squared residuals of the timing arrival dispersions are nearly 100 - 1 nanoseconds ( ns ) that are depending on pulsars @xcite .",
    "the relevant value of the closest approach becomes @xmath91 and the exotic lens potential is roughly @xmath92 this is corresponding to the frequency shift @xmath93 .",
    "this accuracy has been already achieved for a milli - second pulsar @xcite .",
    "furthermore , let us consider a possible constraint on the number density of the exotic lens models .",
    "one event would be detectable , if a lens object entered a volume of a cylinder as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 denotes the distance of the source ( pulsar ) from the observer .",
    "the effective survey volume is proportional to both the number of the observed pulsars ( denoted as @xmath96 ) and the total duration of a pulsar timing project ( denoted as @xmath97 ) .",
    "hence , the number density of the lens objects @xmath98 would be constrained by no event detection as @xmath99 although it seems very weak , this constraint might be interesting , because @xmath28 models are massless at the spatial infinity and thus it is unlikely that these exotic objects are constrained by other observations regarding stellar motions , galactic rotation and so on .",
    "we examined the arrival time delay of light and the frequency shift in the lens model with an inverse power law .",
    "the time delay by a gravitational convex lens ( i.e. positive deflection angle of light ) would be positive , even if the lens model had negative convergence like ellis wormholes .",
    "on the other hand , time delay by a gravitational concave lens might become negative , even if the convergence were positive .    by using the janis - newman - winicour metric , virbhadra and keeton @xcite and deandrea and alexander @xcite have shown that negative time delay is caused in strongly naked singularities , where strongly naked singularities are those which are not covered within any photon spheres .",
    "the present model of a gravitational concave lens suggests that there is no photon spheres , though the present analysis is limited within the weak - field approximation .",
    "the previous works and the present one suggest that negative time delay might be related with whether there exists a photon sphere in a spacetime .",
    "this is left as a future work .    finally , we mention a comparison with the previous works @xcite .",
    "they find distinctive features in lensing effects that are closely related with negative convergence . on the other hand",
    ", the present paper shows that negative time delay might be caused by a gravitational concave lens , even though the convergence is positive .",
    "therefore , the present result might suggest that time delay in such a spacetime will bring us additional information independent of lensing effects .",
    "further study along this course is left as a future work .",
