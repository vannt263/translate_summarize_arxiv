    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics contains , in its minimal version , two sources of time - reversal ( @xmath4 ) , or , equivalently , @xmath5 violation . in the electroweak sector , the phase in the quark mixing matrix @xcite is associated with the jarlskog parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the strong sector contains the qcd vacuum angle @xmath7 @xcite , but the experimental upper limit on the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) shows that @xmath7 is unnaturally small , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 violation within the sm is believed to be insufficient for a successful baryogenesis scenario @xcite , and therefore new sources of @xmath5 violation are expected in order to explain the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "this is not a surprise since the sm is likely but the dimension - four part of an effective field theory ( eft ) that contains higher - dimensional operators , some of which will violate @xmath5 .",
    "powerful probes of such @xmath5 violation beyond the sm are edms of nucleons , nuclei , atoms , and molecules @xcite , which violate both parity and time reversal ( @xmath9 ) . since the sm predictions from the quark mixing matrix @xcite are orders of magnitude away from current experimental limits , a finite edm in upcoming experiments would be an unambiguous sign of new physics .",
    "in addition to impressive improvements @xcite on the time - honored edm experiments with neutrons and neutral atoms , in particular @xmath10hg , which have resulted in very precise limits  @xcite , novel ideas exist for the measurement of edms of charged particles , such as the proton , deuteron and helion , in storage rings @xcite . an important question that comes up",
    "is whether , when future experiments measure nonzero edms , we will be able to pinpoint the microscopic source of @xmath11 and @xmath4 violation .",
    "edms of strongly interacting particles arise from the higher - dimensional @xmath9 operators at the quark - gluon level .",
    "these non - renormalizable operators might have their origin in a renormalizable theory at a higher - energy scale , such as , for example , supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm . at the sm scale",
    ", the most important higher - dimensional @xmath9 operators should be those of dimension six , as we are not concerned here with @xmath5 violation in the dimension - five leptonic operator @xcite that gives rise to neutrino masses and mixings . from symmetry considerations",
    "it is found @xcite that the following flavor - diagonal @xmath9 operators appear at an effective dimension six : the quark electric dipole moment ( qedm )  @xcite , which couples quarks and photons ; the quark chromo - electric dipole moment ( qcedm )  @xcite , which couples quarks and gluons ; the weinberg operator @xcite , which couples three gluons and gives rise to a gluon chromo - electric dipole moment ( gcedm ) @xcite , and four four - quark operators @xcite",
    ".    since it is not feasible to calculate hadronic and nuclear properties directly from a lagrangian at the quark - gluon level , we use chiral eft @xcite a generalization to more than one nucleon of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath12pt ) @xcite to translate microscopic operators into operators that include nucleons , pions , and photons .",
    "( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) after the translation , we are able to calculate hadronic properties directly from the effective lagrangian . for the dimension - four @xmath7 term ,",
    "this method was first employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later extended in the context of @xmath13 @xcite and of @xmath14 @xcite @xmath12pt .    in this paper",
    "we extend the method further to include dimension - six operators in the framework of @xmath13 @xmath12pt .",
    "( generalization to @xmath14 is straightforward . )",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian includes not only interactions that stem from spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking and are therefore chiral invariant , but also interactions that break chiral symmetry in the same way as chiral - symmetry - breaking operators at the qcd level .",
    "since the dimension - six operators break chiral symmetry differently from each other and from the @xmath7 term , they will generate different low - energy hadronic interactions .",
    "given enough observables it should be thus possible to separate the various @xmath9 sources .",
    "in addition to constructing the lagrangian , we need to organize in leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , _ etc . _",
    "the various effective @xmath9 operators that appear .",
    "this is done according to the estimated size of their contributions to observables . in order to get a consistent , manifest power counting we work in the heavy - baryon framework @xcite wherein",
    "the nucleon mass has been eliminated from the nucleon propagator .",
    "this framework has a transparent power counting and greatly simplifies loop calculations , but there are some complications when one goes to subleading orders in the lagrangian .",
    "these problems can be solved by demanding that the lagrangian obeys reparametrization invariance ( rpi ) @xcite .",
    "this puts constraints on certain coefficients of operators , which we construct up to nnlo .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we have used some of the effective interactions to calculate the edms of the nucleons and the lightest nuclei .",
    "it was found that in lo they depend on six low - energy constants ( lecs ) , which for each fundamental @xmath9 source have different relative sizes .",
    "the idea is that , from edm measurements , the lecs can be inferred and the dominant fundamental source identified .",
    "for example , if the deuteron edm is significantly larger than the sum of the nucleon edms , this points towards new physics in form of a qcedm @xcite or , as we will demonstrate here , a particular isospin - breaking @xmath9 four - quark operator .",
    "if the deuteron edm is well approximated by the nucleon edms , but the helion ( triton ) edm is far away from the neutron ( proton ) edm , it is a hint for the sm @xmath7 term .",
    "the deuteron magnetic quadrupole moment ( mqm ) , if experimentally accessible , could play an important role as well @xcite .    in this article , we construct the full lagrangian necessary to perform these and other low - energy @xmath9 calculations .",
    "we follow the approach outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath12pt lagrangian originating from the @xmath7 term was derived , and the higher - dimensional interactions were examined .",
    "we identify , for each source , the size of the six @xmath9 interactions relevant for light nuclear edms . apart from that ,",
    "we construct also all other operators that appear at the same order .",
    "these operators could play a role in the calculation of other observables that violate @xmath11 and @xmath4 such as the edms of heavier nuclei or of ions and atoms .",
    "@xmath9 form factors and scattering observables could depend on these operators as well .",
    "an important ingredient in calculating hadronic and nuclear @xmath9 observables is the @xmath9 pion - nucleon form factor .",
    "we investigate this form factor here .",

    "left- and right - handed quarks are in the fundamental representation of @xmath32 , while leptons and scalars are singlets .",
    "we sometimes group the right - handed up- and down - type quarks in a doublet @xmath33 , and define quark doublets @xmath34 .",

    "gauge invariance is most easily imposed by employing covariant combinations of the gauge and matter fields .",

    "the goldstone bosons are not physical degrees of freedom , so that with a particular choice of gauge , the unitarity gauge , @xmath70 can be set to one . in this gauge , the goldstone bosons are `` eaten '' by the longitudinal polarizations of the massive vector bosons .",
    "we will often use this gauge to discuss the structure of dimension - six operators .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the scalar field kinetic energy provides a mass term for the weak gauge bosons .",

    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , they generate the quark and lepton masses . by means of unitary transformations on the quark and lepton fields ,",
    "it is always possible to make the fermion mass matrices diagonal and real , up to a common phase . for leptons",
    ", these transformations do not leave any trace , while for quarks the price to pay for the diagonalization of the mass matrix is that the interaction of the charged @xmath77 bosons with the quarks is no longer flavor diagonal , an effect that can be obtained by replacing @xmath80 in eq .",

    "however , the contribution of the ckm phase to nuclear edms is orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity , and we will neglect it in the rest of the paper .",
    "the second @xmath9 parameter in the sm lagrangian is the global phase of the quark mass matrices .",

    "these can be accounted for by introducing the only gauge - invariant dimension - five operator that can be written in terms of sm fields @xcite .",
    "the lightness of neutrinos compared to other fermions is explained if the new - physics scale that suppresses this operator is of the order of @xmath93 gev .",
    "any new physics between the electroweak and the gut or planck scales will manifest itself in higher - dimensional operators . a promising strategy to probe such operators",

    ", we see that positive powers of @xmath172 do appear , but they are of course overcompensated by two negative powers of the much larger @xmath96 .",
    "the main result of tadpole extermination is that the vacuum misalignment signaled by the pion tadpoles causes the isoscalar operators , like @xmath386 or @xmath648 , to receive additional contributions from isospin - breaking sources , like the isovector qcedm and the fqlr operator , of the same importance as the contributions of isoscalar sources .",
    "these contributions can be schematically obtained by replacing @xmath649 before tadpole removal with @xmath650 in the power counting estimates of isoscalar operators .",
    "shifts in isovector quantities do not change the dependence of the lecs on @xmath177 , @xmath116 , and @xmath124 , even if possible accidental cancellations could affect the numerical values of the isovector lecs .",
    "it is in the case of fqlr that tadpole rotation is qualitatively most important because , first , fqlr does not have an isoscalar piece and , second , a relatively important three - pion vertex survives .",
    "we notice that the different chiral properties and field content of the @xmath7 term , qcedm , and fqlr on the one side , and qedm and @xmath12iss on the other , imply very different relations between long - distance and short - distance @xmath9 effects .",
    "the @xmath7 term , qcedm , and fqlr all violate chiral symmetry and thus generate @xmath9 pion - nucleon interactions in which the pion couples to the nucleon non - derivatively . as a consequence ,",
    "the first @xmath9 pion - nucleon couplings appear in the lagrangian two orders before short - range contributions to the nucleon edm . for the nucleon edm and edff",
    ", this fact implies that even though pion - nucleon @xmath9 couplings can only contribute to the nucleon edm via loops , which bring in a @xmath651 suppression , they are still as important as the short - distance operators @xcite . for light nuclei , such as the deuteron @xcite and helion @xcite , the most important contribution to @xmath9 electromagnetic moments comes from the @xmath9 ope potential which causes the nucleus wavefunction to mix with states of different parity unless the admixed component has quantum numbers that cause the dipole matrix element to vanish .",
    "the application of chiral eft to study effects of @xmath7 term and qcedm in systems with @xmath652 nucleons is thus particularly promising , since @xmath9 observables are likely to depend on few lecs from the @xmath653 @xmath9 lagrangian .",
    "once these constants are fixed in experiments , one is in the position to make testable , model - independent predictions . for the fqlr",
    ", there appear additional complications for edms of nuclei due to a @xmath9 three - pion interaction , which induces an nlo correction to the two - nucleon potential and , more importantly , a lo three - nucleon potential .",
    "the contributions of this three - nucleon force to light - nuclear edms have , so far , not been calculated .    for the chiral - invariant @xmath9 sources , instead ,",
    "the pion - nucleon @xmath9 couplings appear in the lagrangian at the same order as short - distance nucleon edm operators .",
    "this happens because it is not possible to write a @xmath9 chiral - invariant pion - nucleon coupling with only one derivative .",
    "the first chiral - invariant @xmath9 pion - nucleon coupling must have two derivatives , while nonderivative couplings can be generated by considering the combined effects of chiral - invariant @xmath9 sources and the chiral - breaking quark mass ; in any case , pion - nucleon couplings receive a further suppression of @xmath654 .",
    "it should be noted that this difficulty does not affect the nucleon - photon and nucleon - nucleon sectors , where operators with a minimal number of derivatives can be constructed .",
    "the consequence for the nucleon edm is that it is dominated in this case by short - distance contributions . for light nuclei , @xmath9 corrections to the wavefunction",
    "now are not only due to @xmath9 pion exchange , but also to short - distance nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "in general , the increased role of short - distance interactions in the case of @xmath12iss reduces the predictive power of our analysis , because of the appearance of more lecs .",
    "finally , pion physics is suppressed also in the case of @xmath9 from the qedm . in this case",
    "the suppression comes from the need to integrate out the photon to produce purely hadronic operators , which leads to a factor of @xmath346 . in this case ,",
    "edms of light nuclei are dominated by the nucleon edm .",
    "note that the formalism developed here and in ref .",
    "@xcite can be extended to the construction of interactions involving the delta ( 1232 ) isobar explicitly .",
    "because the delta - nucleon mass splitting is only 290 mev , some lecs can take unnaturally large values when the delta is not included . to avoid the concomitant limitation in convergence @xcite",
    ", the delta should be taken into account as an explicit degree of freedom in the effective lagrangian , in which case it appears in @xmath9 observables at high orders .",
    "traditionally , when discussing parity and time - reversal violation between nucleons and pions , three non - derivative pion - nucleon interactions are considered on the same footing : @xmath655 when one takes into account the chiral properties of the fundamental sources of @xmath9 , the @xmath7 term and the dimension - six sources in eq . , this picture changes .",
    "first , these interactions are accompanied by others with further pion fields .",
    "second , and more important , the three interactions are not of the same size , as noted in ref .",

    "the couplings @xmath385 and @xmath418 are respectively suppressed by two and three powers of @xmath647 @xcite , although , once values from the connection to isospin violation in the quark masses @xcite are taken into account , @xmath386 is numerically smaller than expected @xcite .",
    "if one wants to study observables sensitive to @xmath385 one needs to take into account the full nnlo lagrangian constructed above , which includes , apart from @xmath385 , also derivative pion - nucleon and multi - pion - nucleon interactions .",
    "an example of this is the @xmath9 two - nucleon potential which , at the order where @xmath385 appears , has a rich and non - trivial momentum dependence in the isoscalar channel @xcite .    for qcedm ,",
    "arguably the most natural case is the one where the isoscalar and isovector components are of similar size , @xmath656 . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath386 and @xmath385 interactions appear at the same order .",
    "the third pion - nucleon coupling @xmath418 comes in two orders down in the chiral expansion .",
    "the case of a dominant isoscalar qcedm , @xmath657 , generates an identical low - energy @xmath9 lagrangian as the @xmath7 term , making it impossible to separate these two scenarios from low - energy @xmath9 observables alone . to this goal , more input from techniques like lattice qcd is needed .",
    "the appearance of a dominant isovector qcedm , @xmath658 , implies that @xmath386 and @xmath385 are approximately of the same order , although the former is expected to be somewhat smaller due to the extra factor @xmath368 .",
    "the pattern of non - derivative pion - nucleon interactions in the case of the chiral- and isospin - symmetry - breaking four - quark operator fqlr is very similar to that of a dominant isovector qcedm .",
    "the first difference is the appearance of interactions involving multiple pions , which are hard to isolate .",
    "a second difference is the appearance of @xmath9 mesonic operators which , through loops , add to the @xmath9 pnff momentum dependence , however at subleading order .",
    "the same mesonic operator induces a lo three - nucleon potential , which could be relevant for nuclei with @xmath659 .",
    "regardless , separating the fqlr from an isovector qcedm with hadronic observables requires very precise measurements and is , at this point , not very likely .",
    "the search for @xmath4 violation in @xmath640 decay could provide additional clues @xcite .",
