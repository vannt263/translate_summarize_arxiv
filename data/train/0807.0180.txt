    "the primordial non - gaussianity has been one of the hottest topics in cosmology in recent years .",
    "the conventional , single - field slow - roll inflation predicts that the curvature perturbation is gaussian to an extremely high accuracy  @xcite . in other words , if any primordial non - gaussianity is detected , it strongly indicates that the dynamics of inflation is not as simple as we thought it to be .",
    "the primordial non - gaussianity is conveniently represented by a parameter denoted by @xmath0  @xcite . roughly , it is the ratio of the 3-point correlation function ( or the bispectrum ) to the square of the 2-point correlation function ( or the square of the spectrum ) .",
    "it is expected that near - future experiments such as those of planck will be able to detect @xmath0 at a level as small as 5  @xcite .",
    "finding even a small deviation from gaussianity will have profound implications on the theory of the early universe .",
    "consequently , numerous types of inflationary models that produce detectable non - gaussianity have been proposed and studied  @xcite . in terms of the nature of non - gaussianities ,",
    "most of these models can be classified into two categories ; those with non - gaussianities arising intrinsically from the quantum fluctuations , and those with non - gaussianities due to nontrivial classical dynamics on superhorizon scales .",
    "a typical example of the former is the dbi inflation , in which the slow - roll condition can be fully violated  @xcite . in this case , the equilateral @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath1 ) representing the amplitude of the bispectrum of the equilateral configurations , is found to play an important role  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in the latter case where non - gaussianities are produced on superhorizon scales , by causality the local @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath2 ) characterizes the level of the non - gaussianity .",
    "it is defined in terms of the coefficient in front of the second order curvature perturbation  @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the curvature perturbation on the newtonian slice and @xmath5 is its linear , gaussian part .    in this paper , we focus on the latter case , that is , we consider models that may produce a large value of @xmath2 , for example 10100 .",
    "more specifically , we consider hybrid inflation with multiple inflaton fields , dubbed multi - brid inflation  @xcite .",
    "the inflaton fields are assumed to follow the slow - roll equations of motion , and their fluctuations are assumed to be gaussian . in this case , the @xmath6 formalism is most useful for the evaluation of the curvature perturbation and non - gaussianity  @xcite .    as in the conventional hybrid inflation , the inflaton fields",
    "are coupled to a water - fall field , and inflation ends when the inflaton fields satisfy a certain condition that triggers the instability of the water - fall field .",
    "however , unlike the case of a single inflaton field in which there is essentially no degree of freedom in the condition for the end of inflation , there is a substantial increase in the degree of freedom at the end of inflation in multi - brid inflation and it widens the viable range of the parameter space considerably and leads to the possibility of generating large non - gaussianity .    as a model of multi - brid inflation , an analytically solvable two - brid inflation model was recently investigated in detail  @xcite , where the potential was assumed to be exponential with the exponent given by a linear combination of the inflaton fields . in this paper , we consider a two - brid model with again an exponential potential but with the exponent given by a quadratic function of the inflaton fields .",
    "the potential has point symmetry about the origin of the field space , in contrast to the case of the linear exponent which has no symmetry .",
    "thus by investigating the quadratic case , we will be able to see if the generation of large non - gaussianity is a generic feature of multi - brid inflation or if it is due to the lack of symmetry that leads to large non - gaussianity in the linear exponent case .",
    "in passing , we mention that the possibility of large non - gaussianity from loop correction terms in the perturbative expansion has recently been discussed by cogollo et al .  @xcite .",
    "although such a case certainly needs further investigation , in this paper we concentrate on the case in which leading order ( tree ) terms dominate over loop correction terms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe our model and derive basic formulas to be used in the proceeding sections . in ",
    "3 , using the formulas derived in  2 , we analytically compute the spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath7 , its spectral index @xmath8 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 , and the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath2 . in ",
    "4 , as a couple of special cases of our model , we analyze in detail the equal - mass case as well as the case of large mass ratio .",
    "we find that a large @xmath2 is possible in both cases .",
    "in particular , in the equal - mass case , by tuning the parameters to some extent , we find that it is possible to have both @xmath9 and @xmath2 large enough to be detected .",
    "we conclude the paper in  5 .",

    "<S> a model of multi - component hybrid inflation , dubbed multi - brid inflation , in which various observable quantities including the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 can be analytically calculated was proposed recently . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for a two - brid inflation model with an exponential potential and the condition that the end of inflation is an ellipse in the field space , it was found that , while keeping the other observational quantities within the range consistent with observations , large non - gaussianity is possible for certain inflationary trajectories , provided that the ratio of the two masses is large </S>",
    "<S> . one might question whether the resulting large non - gaussianity is specific to this particular form of the potential and the condition for the end of inflation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a model of multi - brid inflation with a potential given by an exponential function of terms quadratic in the scalar field components . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a more general class of ellipses for the end of inflation than those studied previously . </S>",
    "<S> then , focusing on the case of two - brid inflation , we find that large non - gaussianity is possible in the present model even for the equal - mass case . then by tuning the model parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there exist models for which both the non - gaussianity and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are large enough to be detected in the very near future . </S>"
