    "coma berenices ( melotte  111 , ra@xmath023@xmath1 , dec@xmath200@xmath3 , j2000.0 ) is the second closest open cluster to the sun .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ distance of melotte 111 is @xmath4  pc ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van leeuwen 1999 ) ) , in agreement with older ground - based estimates ( e.g. @xmath5  pc , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nicolet 1981 ) ) .",
    "the metallicity of the cluster has been derived by several authors .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cayrel de strobel ( 1990 ) ) determined [ fe / h ] @xmath6  dex , whereas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* friel & boesgaard ( 1992 ) ) found [ fe / h ] @xmath7  dex .",
    "the age of the cluster is estimated between 400 and 500 myr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bounatiro & arimoto 1993 ) ) . as its physical parameters",
    "are well constrained , the variability studies in melotte  111 are very important .",
    "we have carried out a search for new pulsating stars in the direction of melotte 111 . as a result of this search ,",
    "the star melotte  111  av  1224 was found to be a new variable star .",
    "this star was originally designated av  1224 in the astrometric catalogue for the area of coma berenices ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* abad & vicente 1999 ) ) .",
    "it is listed as a cluster member in the simbad database .",
    "this work presents preliminary results aimed at characterizing the variability of this target .",
    "the ccd observations of the melotte  111 open cluster have been made with the 0.84-m f/15 ritchey - chrtien telescope at oan - spm observatory , during ten consecutive nights , between april 11 and 20 , 2009 .",
    "the telescope hosted the filter - wheel ` mexman ' with the marconi ( e2v ) ccd camera , which has a 2048 @xmath8 2048 pixels array , with a pixel size of 15 @xmath8 15 @xmath9m@xmath10 .",
    "the typical field - of - view in this configuration amounts to 7@xmath3 @xmath8 7@xmath3 .",
    "the observations were obtained through a johnson @xmath11 filter .",
    "the usual calibration procedures for ccd photometry have been carried out during our observing run .",
    "sky flat fields , bias and dark exposures were taken every night .",
    "the resulting light curve is not sinusoidal , but is strictly periodic ; the frequency spectrum reveals two peaks , @xmath12  d@xmath13 , @xmath14 23.2  mmag and @xmath15  d@xmath13 , @xmath14 10.6  mmag .",
    "the light curve of av  1224 phased with its main period , is shown in fig .",
    "we have also derived the following indices in the strmgren system for av  1224 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the star were conducted with the 2.12-m telescope of the oan - spm observatory in june 2011 .",
    "we used the same equipment as explained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baran et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) .",
    "in particular , we used boller & chivens spectrograph installed in the cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "the 400 lines / mm grating with a blaze angle of 4.18@xmath20 was used .",
    "the grating angle was set to 7@xmath20 to cover wavelength range from 4000 to 7500 .",
    "a 2048@xmath82048 e2v ccd camera was used in the observations .",
    "the typical resolution of the recorded spectra is 8 and the dispersion amounts to 1.8 per pixel .",
    "the reduction procedure was performed with the standard routines of the iraf package .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the reduced spectrum of av  1224 and , for comparison , the spectrum of a standard star of spectral type k0v taken on the same night .",
    "considering the strmgren indices and the stellar spectrum , the variability of av  1224 due to pulsations can be ruled out .",
    "its light curve resembles rather those observed in w ursae majoris - type variables ( wuma ) , also called ew stars .",
    "as it is known , the components of w uma systems are in contact and are main - sequence stars of nearly the same spectral type , from around middle a to early k. their orbital periods range from 0.2 to 1.4 days .",
    "an in - deep analysis of these observations will be given elsewhere ."
