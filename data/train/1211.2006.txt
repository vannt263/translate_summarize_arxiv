    "as is well known , the upper critical dimension ( ucd ) for ising ferromagnets is four .",
    "here we show results of simulations for an ising ferromagnet with near neighbor interactions , on a simple [ hyper]cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions in dimension five , the next dimension up .",
    "the hamiltonian is as usual @xmath0 with spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 near neighbors",
    ". we will take @xmath3 and will quote inverse temperatures @xmath4 .",
    "all the principal properties of this system are well known .",
    "recent consistent and precise estimates of the inverse ordering temperature @xmath5 are @xmath6 @xcite , 0.113925(12 ) @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite from simulations , and 0.113920(1)@xcite from high temperature series expansion ( htse ) .",
    "we will use @xmath8 as a compromise estimate .",
    "the susceptibility critical exponent and the effective correlation length exponent take the exact mean field values @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with a leading correction to scaling exponent @xmath11 @xcite . in the periodic boundary condition geometry , above the ucd the `` effective length '' is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a non - universal constant @xcite .",
    "we analyse simulation data for the `` two replica '' observables link overlap and spin overlap , familiar in the ising spin glass ( isg ) context .",
    "it might seem curious to apply techniques developed for complex systems to the much simpler ferromagnet , particularly above the ucd , even though the observables can be defined in exactly the same way in a ferromagnet as in an isg .",
    "properties of the spin overlap at and beyond @xmath5 have already been studied in the @xmath14d ising ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "however , just because all the major parameters are well known it is convenient to use the @xmath15d ferromagnet as a testbed for studying the critical behavior of various moments or moment ratios ( the variance , the kurtosis and the skewness ) of both overlap distributions .",
    "the results should be generalizable _ mutatis mutandis _ to all ising ferromagnets .",
    "the final aim is to establish the ground rules for the properties related to the link overlap near criticality in order to apply a similar methodology to complex systems , in particular to isgs .",
    "the link overlap @xcite , like the more familiar spin overlap , is an important parameter in isg numerical simulations . in both cases two replicas ( copies ) @xmath13 and @xmath16 of the same physical system , i.e. with identical sets of interactions between spins , are first generated and equilibrated ; updating is then continued and the `` overlaps '' between the two replicas are recorded over long time intervals .",
    "the spin overlap at any instant @xmath17 corresponds to the fraction @xmath18 of spins @xmath19 in @xmath13 and @xmath16 having the same orientation ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 both up or both down ) , and the normalized overall distribution over time is written @xmath22 .",
    "the link overlap corresponds to the fraction @xmath23 of links ( or bonds or edges ) @xmath24 between spins which are either both satisfied or both dissatisfied in the two replicas ; the normalized overall distribution over time is written @xmath25 .",
    "the explicit definitions are @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of spins in the system and @xmath29 the number of links ; spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 are linked , as denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "we will indicate means taken over time by @xmath30 .",
    "equilibration and measurement runs were performed by standard heat bath updating on sites selected at random .",
    "the spin systems started with a random configuration , i.e. at infinite temperature , and were gradually cooled and equilibrated until they reached their designated temperatures , where they received a longer equilibration .",
    "for example , for @xmath31 the systems at @xmath32 saw roughly @xmath33 sweeps before any measurements took place and the smaller systems at least @xmath34 sweeps .",
    "several sweeps were made between measurements and with a flip rate of about @xmath35 near @xmath5 which means at least four sweeps between measurements .",
    "for @xmath31 about @xmath34 measurements were recorded at each temperature near @xmath5 and considerably more for the smaller systems .",
    "for any standard near neighbor ising ferromagnet with all interactions identical and with periodic boundary conditions , there is a simple rule for the mean link overlap in equilibrium @xmath36 . if @xmath37 is the probability averaged over time that any given bond is satisfied , then by definition the mean energy per bond is @xmath38 because all bonds are equivalent @xmath39 this rule is exact at all temperatures ( we have checked this numerically ) , so it would appear at first glance that link overlap measurements present no interest in a simple ferromagnet as they contain no more information than the energy .",
    "however , the moments of the link overlap distribution reflect the structure of the temporary spin clusters which build up in the paramagnetic state before @xmath5 , and the domain structure in the ferromagnetic state beyond @xmath5",
    ". thus if at some instant @xmath17 a cluster of parallel spins exists in replica @xmath13 and a similar cluster in the same part of space exists in replica @xmath16 , then the instantaneous @xmath23 will be significantly higher than the time average @xmath40 .",
    "the width of the overall distribution @xmath25 increases rapidly on the approach to @xmath5 and we find phenomenologically that , as a consequence of the repeated occurrence of the cluster situation , around the critical temperature the distributions do not remain simple gaussians but develop excess kurtosis and skewness , even though to the naked eye these deviations from pure gaussian distributions are not obvious ; for instance no secondary peaks appear in the distributions .",
    "we exhibit in figures 1 to 4 data at sizes @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the q - variance @xmath43 the q - kurtosis @xmath44 and the q - skewness @xmath45    the three q moments and moment ratios follow the standard definitions for the moments of a distribution . for the q - variance we plot",
    "@xmath46 so as to display the entire range of data . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the behavior of the q - variance from high temperature through @xmath5 to @xmath47 , well into the ordered state .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the same data in the region near @xmath5 .",
    ", as a function of size and inverse temperature for the @xmath15d near neighbor ferromagnet . in this and all the following figures the convention for indicating",
    "size is : @xmath48 , blue triangles ; @xmath49 , red circles ; @xmath50 , black squares ; @xmath31 , pink inverted triangles . in this and",

    ", width=336 ]    [ fig:2 ]    it can be seen that the q - variance has clear critical behavior .",
    "just as for standard `` phenomenological couplings '' such as the binder cumulant or the correlation length ratio @xmath52 ( in the @xmath15d case @xcite ) , it is size independent at @xmath5 to within a finite size correction .",
    "as the q - variance is a phenomenological coupling in this particular system , it can be expected to have a similar form as a function of temperature in any ferromagnet , with the appropriate finite size correction exponent .",
    "this makes the q - variance a supplementary phenomenological coupling for ferromagnets in general .",
    "as @xmath53 is a near - neighbor measurement like the energy , the distribution @xmath25 tends to equilibrate faster on annealing than a parameter such as the correlation length @xmath54 .",

    ", width=336 ]    [ fig:4 ]    the q - kurtosis has a more unusual form , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . at temperatures well above or well below the critical temperature it takes up the gaussian value @xmath55 , but near criticality",
    "there is an excess q - kurtosis peak corresponding to a `` fat tailed '' form of the link overlap distribution . with increasing @xmath56 the width and strength of the peak decrease and the peak position @xmath57 approaches @xmath5 . in the present @xmath15d ferromagnet case the form of the temperature dependence evolves with @xmath56 ; with increasing @xmath56 from a simple peak it tends to peak plus",
    "the q - skewness , fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , resembles the q - kurtosis plot .",
    "the q - skewness starts at @xmath58 ( a symmetric distribution ) at @xmath59 and then develops a strong positive peak as a function of @xmath60 in the region of @xmath5 ( so a distribution @xmath25 tilted towards high @xmath53 ) .",
    "again the width and the strength of the peak decrease with increasing @xmath56 .",
    "there is a weak indication of the beginning of a dip beyond the peak .",
    "the q - kurtosis and q - skewness can be expected to show qualitatively the same critical peak form in any ferromagnet .    for the moment",
    "these observations are essentially phenomenological ; it would be of interest to go beyond the argument given above in terms of correlated clusters of spins so as to obtain a full quantitative explanation for the details of the critical behavior of the @xmath25 distribution and its moments in finite @xmath56 samples .",
    "link overlap moment peaks in isgs resemble these ferromagnet results @xcite implying that the peak structure is a very general qualitative form of the behavior of link overlap distributions at an ising magnet critical point .",
    "the link overlap can be defined for vector spins @xcite by @xmath61    \\label{qlvec}\\ ] ] which is invariant under global symmetry operations ; the same link overlap critical properties as seen in ising systems may well exist in @xmath62 and heisenberg magnets also .",
    "as for the link overlap , one can also define various moments and moment ratios of the spin overlap distribution such as the p - variance @xmath63 and the p - kurtosis @xmath64 which is simply related to the binder - like p - cumulant @xmath65 .     for the @xmath15d near neighbor ferromagnet as a function of size and inverse temperature .",

    ", width=336 ]    [ fig:5 ]     for the @xmath15d near neighbor ferromagnet as a function of size and inverse temperature .",
    "sizes coded as in fig .  [ fig:1 ] . , width=336 ]    [ fig:6 ]    the p - variance in the ferromagnet has the phenomenological coupling form , fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ; at @xmath5 the p - variance tends to an @xmath56 independent value with a finite size correction .",
    "as the temperature goes to zero the p - variance will tend to @xmath66 .",
    "the p - kurtosis has a different phenomenological coupling form , a peak before a sharp drop to @xmath67 , corresponding to the @xmath22 distribution becoming `` fat tailed '' before and at @xmath5 before taking on a two - peak structure in the ordered state  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the magnetization m - kurtosis ( usually expressed as the binder cumulant ) in ferromagnets or the standard p - kurtosis in isgs which both drop regularly from the gaussian value @xmath14 towards the two peak value @xmath67 with increasing order .",
    "however , it can be noted that the temperature variation of the kurtosis for the chiral order parameter in heisenberg spin glasses has the same general form as the present ferromagnetic p - kurtosis , the distribution becoming fat tailed above the ordering temperature @xcite .    as the distributions @xmath22 in equilibrium",
    "are by definition symmetrical about @xmath68 , the p - skewness is always zero . however , for the one - sided distribution of the absolute value of @xmath69 , other parameters can be defined , in particular the absolute p - kurtosis @xmath70 and the absolute p - skewness @xmath71    the absolute p - kurtosis and the absolute p - skewness in the ferromagnet have rather complex phenomenological coupling temperature dependence patterns , with very weak finite size corrections at @xmath5 , figs .  [ fig:7 ] , and [ fig:8 ] .",
    "if the weak finite size correction is a general property for these parameters , it could be usefully exploited so as to obtain high precision estimates of ordering temperatures in systems where these temperatures are not well known .",
    "the spin overlap properties do not transport from the ferromagnet into isg systems in the same manner as the link overlap properties do because the p - variance takes on a different status : in an isg @xmath72 becomes the order parameter .",

    "the standard near neighbor interaction ising ferromagnet on a simple [ hyper]cubic lattice in dimension five has been used as a test case in order to demonstrate the critical form of the temperature variations of observables related to the link overlap and the spin overlap , parameters developed in the isg context and not generally recorded in ferromagnet simulations .",
    "the moments of the link and spin overlap distributions @xmath73 and @xmath22 show a rich variety of temperature variations , with specific critical behaviors .",
    "the temperature dependence of the link overlap kurtosis and the link overlap skewness show peaks at criticality which are `` evanescent '' in the sense that they will disappear in the the large size thermodynamic limit .",
    "the present results validate the assumption that these observables show true critical temperature dependencies .",
    "a temporary cluster phenomenon is proposed as determining the evolution of the link overlap distributions .",
    "if correct , this mechanism is quite general , so we expect the critical peaks in the q - kurtosis and the q - skewness to be present in the entire class of ising ferromagnets , not only those in dimensions above the ucd , and plausibly in vector spin ferromagnets also . beyond the class of ferromagnets , it can be noted that link overlap q - kurtosis and q - skewness critical peaks have also been observed @xcite in ising spin glasses .",
