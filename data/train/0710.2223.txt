    "a great interest on chaotic systems with internal losses , or absorption , is due to the fact that they are good candidates to verify random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "the effect of losses has given rise to many theoretical and experimental investigations on transport properties ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular microwave @xcite and acoustic resonators @xcite , microwave networks @xcite and elastic systems @xcite are excellent tools for that purpuse .",
    "one of the most important things in absorbing systems is to quantify the degree of the losses suffered in an experimental situation .",
    "although in some experiments the absorption strength @xmath0 can be partially controlled by attaching aditional antennas @xcite or introducing absorber materials inside the system @xcite , the intrinsic absorption is not directly under experimental control .",
    "however , it can be tunned to fit the experimental data @xcite . in a single - mode port microwave resonator setup of refs . @xcite , the one channel case , @xmath0 was determined as the one that reproduces the experimental value of the average of the reflection coefficient @xmath1 , which is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar procedure was used in ref . @xcite but with the transmission coefficient @xmath2 in a two single - mode ports . in that case , @xmath0 was chosen as the value in which the theoretical distribution of @xmath2 fits the experimental one .",
    "also , the value of @xmath0 was estimated from the fidelity @xcite .",
    "the imperfect coupling of the antennas to the cavity has a similar effect as the absorption and unfortunately the last procedure can not discern what part of @xmath0 is due to losses and what to the rejected part of the wave that never enter the cavity . in this sense an imperfect coupling mimics absorption and a procedure that gives the correct value of @xmath0 is needed . here",
    "we present a semi - analytical formula to calculate @xmath0 which takes into account the coupling for the one channel case .",
    "this is helpful in experiments with microwave networks and one port cavities .",
    "although the procedure is the same for higher number of channels , it is not possible to give a result due to the absence of knowlegde of the probability distribution of the scattering matrix @xcite .    in the next section we summarize the existing theory used to describe the scattering process through chaotic cavities with losses , taking the imperfect coupling to a single - mode port into account .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in a single - mode port cavity in the presence of losses , the scattering matrix @xmath4 is a subunitary @xmath5 matrix that we parametrize as @xmath6 here @xmath3 is the reflection coefficient and @xmath7 is minus twice the phase shift due to the scattering process into the cavity . those quantities are measured in actual experiments with microwaves .     describes the scattering of the cavity with perfect coupling of the antenna represented as a flat waveguide .",
