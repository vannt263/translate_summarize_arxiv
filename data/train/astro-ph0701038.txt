    "massive star formation in the milky way and in external galaxies takes place in a wide range of circumstances . in the current universe ,",
    "perhaps the most extreme star formation takes place in `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) , which may be the forerunners of globular clusters ( e.g. , whitmore 2002 ) .",
    "individual sscs may have ionizing fluxes equal to that of @xmath5 to @xmath6 o7-equivalent stars within diameters of just a few parsecs @xcite .",
    "the initial mass functions in sscs have been reported to be top - heavy ; however , studies of initial mass functions are affected by crowding in the fields and mass segregation in clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total masses of sscs may be uncertain by an order of magnitude , but it appears that at least some sscs have total masses of @xmath7 to @xmath8 . if they are in wolf - rayet galaxies , such as the galaxies that are the subjects of this paper , the sscs may form most of their mass into stars on a time scale of 15@xmath9  yr @xcite .",
    "thus their star formation rates per unit area may be above @xmath10  yr@xmath1  pc@xmath11 , or @xmath12",
    "yr@xmath1  kpc@xmath11 , a factor of at least 1000 higher than the average value in larger - area starbursts @xcite .",
    "there are a variety of means of estimating the stellar content , star formation rate , or supernova rate in starbursts .",
    "for example , one may count ionizing photons by measuring the h@xmath13 luminosity in a starburst galaxy or an ssc .",
    "however , such a method may greatly underestimate the number of ionizing photons , if the ssc is heavily obscured by dust .",
    "a more reliable method of counting ionizing photons may be from the study of thermal radio emission , although this also may be subject to free - free absorption , leakage through a porous interstellar medium , or absorption of ionizing photons by dust .",
    "mid - infrared imaging also may measure the total energy output in an ssc , although the resolution of such imaging often is not adequate to isolate individual sscs .",
    "globally , either far - infrared or radio powers of galaxies may suffice to estimate their total star - formation rate @xcite , but these data generally are of resolution too low to isolate individual sscs .",
    "yet another method is to search for young supernovae , thus inferring a supernova rate that may give clues about the star - formation rate within an ssc .",
    "however , the supernovae in the densest star - forming regions may be heavily obscured by dust and impossible to detect optically . in this circumstance ,",
    "young radio supernovae may be detected more easily at centimeter wavelengths ; milliarcsecond resolution may be used to separate them from the more diffuse thermal and synchrotron radiation present in the sscs @xcite .",
    "we have made vlbi high sensitivity array ( hsa ) observations of three nearby dwarf galaxies , ii  zw  40 , he  2 - 10 , and ngc  5253 , containing either one or several sscs that are separated by a few parsecs to tens of parsecs .",
    "existing mid - infrared and radio interferometric images of these galaxies are sufficient to isolate the individual sscs and estimate their total ionizing fluxes .",
    "all three target galaxies display significant wolf - rayet spectral features , indicating the presence of ( at least ) hundreds of massive stars that have evolved off the main sequence .",
    "our hsa imaging was carried out in an effort to detect young radio supernovae within the sscs in the dwarf galaxies , and hence to assess the local supernova rates .",
    "this paper reports the results of our hsa supernova search , which reaches to detection thresholds near the power of cas  a in all three target galaxies , and its implications for their stellar contents and supernova rates .",
    "we observed our three target galaxies on 2005 feb 26/27 using the hsa ( program i d bu030 ) .",
    "the hsa observations made use of the 10 antennas of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , 25 phased antennas of the very large array ( vla ) , and the 100 m green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the 305 m arecibo telescope also was used for ii zw 40 , but he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 are too far south to be accessible to arecibo . each target",
    "was observed in dual - circular polarization at 4.991  ghz frequency , with total bandwidths of 32  mhz at each polarization and 2-bit sampling .",
    "the total observing time for each target was between 2 and 4 hours , while the on - source integrations ranged from 1 to 2 hours .",
    "integration times were 10% to 30% less for gbt , vla , and arecibo , since these telescopes slew more slowly than the vlba antennas .",
    "all three targets were known to be quite weak , so they were observed by means of phase - referencing to an angularly nearby calibrator source , separated from the target by @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "typical cycle times in minutes were 1 - 2 - 1 ( including slew times ) for the calibrator - target - calibrator sequences ; an additional 10 - 20 seconds was allowed on each calibrator or target for ii zw 40 , due to the slower slew speed of arecibo .",
    "details of the observations for the individual galaxies are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "all data calibration was carried out in nrao s astronomical image processing system , aips @xcite .",
    "data flagging was done using vlba monitor data , estimates of on - source time for the other antennas , and careful inspection of the data .",
    "amplitude calibration for the vlba , gbt , and arecibo was done by using the values for the antenna gains maintained by telescope personnel as well as measurements of system temperature made frequently during the observations ; this calibration is believed to have an accuracy of 5% .",
    "the vla antennas were made mutually coherent by adjusting their individual phases during the observations of the phase - reference sources , and the vla amplitude response was calibrated with respect to j0137 + 3429 ( 3c  48 ) and j1331 + 3030 ( 3c  286 ) , using the scale of @xcite .",
    "for each calibrator and galaxy , a - priori ionospheric corrections were applied by means of interpolation among models tabulated for every two hours at regular spacings around the sky , and the most accurate available earth orientation parameters were applied , correcting the less accurate values used at the time of correlation .",
    "clock and related offsets for the entire observing session were calibrated by using observations of the calibrators j0552 + 0313 , j0854 + 2006 , and j0927 + 3902 .",
    "corrections to time - dependent delay and phase errors ( largely due to the atmosphere above each station ) were computed using the local phase - reference sources , and applied to the target galaxies . for ii zw 40 and",
    "ngc 5253 , the phase - reference sources were dominated by point sources , so point - source models sufficed for convergence of this process . for he 2 - 10 , the reference source j0846@xmath162610 was found to be a well - resolved double source with a separation of about 40 milliarcseconds , so a self - calibrated image of this source was used as a model for the time - dependent corrections .",
    "because j0846@xmath162610 was completely resolved away on all baselines to the mauna kea vlba antenna , all mauna kea data were flagged bad for the galaxy he 2 - 10 .",
    "finally , bad weather above the hancock vlba antenna led to a 50% correction to its amplitude calibration on ii zw 40 , and the antenna was flagged bad on he 2 - 10 . because of the presence of the large gbt and vla telescopes , the absence of mauna kea and hancock for ii zw 40 led to little degradation in the achieved sensitivity",
    "as part of the imaging process , we made vla images of all three target galaxies , which enabled us to confirm the locations where we might search for compact milliarcsecond - scale radio emission in the hsa data .",
    "since the vla was in its * b * configuration at the time of our observations , with a maximum baseline length of 9  km , the resolution of these vla observations was roughly 1.5  arcseconds .",
    "figure  [ fig : vla ] shows the resulting vla images at 4.99 ghz ; a few details of the images are listed in table  [ tab : vla ] .",
    "the vlba images were made with `` natural '' weighting of the visibility data in order to achieve the best possible sensitivity .",
    "the imaging was carried out over a number of 4096 by 4096 pixel fields , with pixel sizes of 0.40.5 milliarcseconds .",
    "the resolution of the images was sub - parsec ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , typically with better resolution in the east - west direction since the sources were at low declination and the vlbi array had a significant east - west elongation .",
    "spectral and time averaging in the correlation and imaging were set so that the peak flux densities in the relatively wide fields imaged were not degraded by averaging of the data ( see bridle & schwab 1999 for discussion of this effect ) .",
    "the total area imaged at milliarcsecond resolution is shown for each galaxy in figure  [ fig : vla ] .",
    "although these relatively low resolution vla images display some radio emission outside the areas imaged with hsa , higher resolution images of all galaxies ( published , or made from archival vla data ) confirm that all regions with sub - arcsecond 5 ghz emission were included in the hsa imaging .    for each galaxy , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 pixels were included in the wide - field hsa images .",
    "thus , in the absence of a - priori information about the location of milliarcsecond radio sources , setting a @xmath19 source detection threshold clearly is inadequate .",
    "most individual images contained pixels between 5 and 6 times the rms noise , and a few fields had pixels above 6 times the noise , in seemingly random locations .",
    "therefore , we set conservative upper limits for each galaxy of 7 times the rms noises given in table  [ tab : obs ] . to get true upper limits , it also is necessary to account for possible losses of interferometer coherence in the phase - referencing process . to estimate this coherence loss",
    ", we observed the `` check '' source j0826@xmath162230 occasionally in place of he  2 - 10 and j1316@xmath163338 in place of ngc  5253 .",
    "( no check source was observed for ii zw 40 because of the long slew times that would have been required for the arecibo telescope ) . comparing the peak flux densities of j0826@xmath162230 and j1316@xmath163338 in phase - referenced images to those derived after self - calibration indicates respective coherence loss factors of 2 and 3 at calibrator - galaxy separations of 59 and 38 .",
    "coherence losses typically increase approximately linearly with the calibrator - galaxy separation @xcite , so we infer reductions in the peak amplitudes by a factor of 1.4 for he  2 - 10 and a factor of 2.0 for ngc  5253 .",
    "ii  zw  40 was observed at a much smaller switching angle of 07 . and at a higher elevation than the other two galaxies ; averaging the interpolated values for the other two galaxies , we estimate a reduction factor of 1.2 for the peak amplitudes of any real sources in ii  zw  40 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the final upper limits for each galaxy which are given in table  [ tab : limits ] .",
    "ii  zw  40 is a dwarf starburst galaxy at a distance of 10.5 mpc @xcite .",
    "it is known to be a wolf - rayet galaxy @xcite , suggesting significant star formation 3 - 6 myr in the past and indicating the presence of a population of evolved massive stars that are temporally associated with the onset of supernovae . from near - infrared and optical imaging ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the bulk of the recent starburst activity is less than 4  myr old , which implies that the galaxy still may be ramping up to its peak number of evolved massive stars and supernovae . based on their models ,",
    "@xcite predict a supernova rate of @xmath20  sn yr@xmath1 .",
    "neutral hydrogen observations indicate moderate depressions associated with the active star forming region , plausibly suggesting the impact of mechanical feedback from stellar winds and/or supernovae @xcite .",
    "previous radio observations of ii  zw  40 indicate a relative lack of non - thermal emission .",
    "@xcite find that the 5 ghz flux is dominated by thermal emission , and estimate a total non - thermal flux at 1.49 ghz of 2.43.9  mjy , which is consistent with ii  zw  40 only having a low level of recent supernovae activity .",
    "@xcite fit a radio spectrum to ii  zw  40 indicating that most of the radio emission is optically thin thermal emission , presumably energized by young stars ; from the radio source in the central @xmath21 , they infer the presence of @xmath22 o7-equivalent stars .",
    "larger scale emission inferred by @xcite is imaged more clearly in our figure  [ fig : vla ] , but this emission clearly is not compact on milliarcsecond scales .",
    "thus , the region that we imaged using the hsa contains all the subarcsecond - scale flux in ii  zw  40 .",
    "the most compact 15 ghz sources in this region have flux densities of 0.40.6  mjy  beam@xmath1 , implying similar 5  ghz flux densities for thermal sources , so it would be feasible for these sources to contain radio supernovae at the level of 0.10.3  mjy at 5  ghz .",
    "our conservative hsa upper limit of 0.09  mjy  beam@xmath1 is somewhat lower , and corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath23  w  hz@xmath1 at 5  ghz .",
    "we can compare this limit to the power of the galactic supernova remnant cas  a , which presently has a 5  ghz flux density of 650  jy @xcite . for a distance of 3.4  kpc @xcite ,",
    "the cas  a power at 5 ghz is @xmath24  w  hz@xmath1 , so we conclude that there are no radio supernovae in ii  zw  40 with powers greater than 1.3 times cas  a.      he 2 - 10 is another dwarf galaxy , at a distance of 9  mpc .",
    "its current star formation is dominated by a star - forming region that contains several hundred wolf - rayet stars @xcite and @xmath25 emission energized by @xmath26 o7-equivalent stars @xcite in a starburst of age 1020  myr @xcite .",
    "a series of high - resolution optical , mid - infrared , and radio imaging observations @xcite culminated in a high - resolution vla image of five compact radio sources spread over about @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "these five radio sources have 5  ghz flux densities ranging from 0.6 to 2.3  mjy ; based on vla observations ranging from 5 ghz to 43 ghz , @xcite modeled four of them as partially opaque thermal bremsstrahlung sources .",
    "our 5  ghz hsa imaging of the entire region covered by the five vla sources shows no detections of milliarcsecond radio emission , with the conservative upper limit of 0.21  mjy  beam@xmath1 corresponding to 2.2 times the power of cas  a.    vla source 3 found by @xcite is of particular interest here because its spectrum appears to be dominated by nonthermal emission , as one might expect from a young supernova or collection of supernova remnants , or even an active galactic nucleus .",
    "therefore , we have examined the vicinity of this radio source carefully in our hsa image , searching for an excess of @xmath28 or @xmath29 radio sources .",
    "within 025 of source 3 , the peak flux density is only @xmath30 , implying that we detect no young supernovae within that nonthermal source . given rough upper limits of @xmath31  mjy for the 5  ghz thermal radio emission from this source ( estimated by using the highest frequency radio emission )",
    ", its total mass in stars can be scaled from the thermal models of the other vla sources @xcite and is found to be @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the local supernova rate within this source is expected to be less than @xmath4  yr@xmath1 . our hsa upper limit ( taking account of the estimated vlbi coherence loss ) is 0.13  mjy  beam@xmath1 , or 1.4 times the power of cas  a , while the total vla nonthermal emission of @xmath33  mjy is about 4 times the cas  a power .",
    "the hsa beam size of @xmath34  mas corresponds to a linear size of roughly @xmath35  pc .",
    "thus we suggest the possibility that at least half of the vla - scale radio emission in this source is generated by one or more supernova remnants with ages of a few hundred to a few thousand years , total power several times that of cas  a and diameter(s ) of 0.5  pc or larger .",
    "such a source or sources would account for the nonthermal emission detected by the vla , but would be too heavily resolved to be detected in our hsa observations .",
    "ngc  5253 also is a wolf - rayet galaxy @xcite , located at a distance of only 4.1  mpc @xcite .",
    "the strength of the br@xmath13 line indicates the presence of @xmath5 o7-equivalent stars within the central @xmath36 , and @xmath37 such stars in the central @xmath38 , or 400  pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite used hst imaging to identify several young clusters in the inner few arcseconds , including two with ages of 2.5 and 34  myr .",
    "they find that the younger cluster may be as massive as @xmath8 , and the total star formation intensity averaged over the central @xmath39 is 10100 @xmath40  yr@xmath1  kpc@xmath11 .",
    "two type i supernovae brighter than 9th magnitude have been confirmed in ngc  5253 in the last 111 years : sn1895b ( z cen ) occurred @xmath41 northeast of the galaxy nucleus @xcite , while sn1972e was @xmath42 to the southwest @xcite . a third reported supernova ,",
    "sn1986f , apparently was not a real event @xcite .",
    "the full region imaged by the vla in b configuration during our vlbi observations ( not shown in figure  [ fig : vla ] ) does not detect either sn1895b or sn1972e , with @xmath19 upper limits of 0.17  mjy  beam@xmath1 , considerably fainter than the 1.4 ghz upper limits for the supernovae that were found by @xcite in the early 1970s .",
    "both of these supernovae were reported to be type i , which typically are undetected ( type ia ) or have rapid turn - on and turn - off ( type ib / c ) at radio wavelengths , so the lack of any vla detection is not surprising .",
    "diffuse radio emission is seen to span the entire @xmath38 central region @xcite ; both of the confirmed supernovae mentioned above lie well outside this region .",
    "@xcite found a `` radio supernebula '' in the central arcsecond that is optically thick near 15  ghz , and used the radio flux density to infer the presence of @xmath43 o7-equivalent stars in the central few parsecs , considerably higher than suggested from the br@xmath13 line , at the very center of the starburst , a compact double radio source was imaged by @xcite using the vla at 43 ghz .",
    "this appears to coincide with a near - infrared double star cluster with a separation of 6 - 8  pc @xcite .",
    "the eastern member of that cluster pair corresponds to the youngest cluster identified by @xcite , and also seen in the ultraviolet by @xcite .",
    "our hsa images cover the @xmath44 region of ngc  5253 with the most compact radio emission , as shown in figure  [ fig : vla ] . within this region",
    ", there is emission on scales ranging from subarcsecond to many arcseconds .",
    "there are no published 5  ghz images of ngc  5253 made with the vla * a * configuration , so we extracted and processed an * a * configuration data set obtained to search for radio emission from the putative supernova 1986f , resulting in the radio image shown in figure  [ fig : a5253 ]",
    ". comparison of this image with the * b * configuration image shows that there is considerable 5 ghz emission on scales between @xmath45 and @xmath46 that is poorly sampled by our hsa observations ; in fact , the effects of this emission forced us to remove the sensitive baseline between the phased vla and the pie town vlba antenna ( 60  km away ) in order to make a noise - limited hsa image .",
    "the inferred 5  ghz upper limit of 0.29  mjy  beam@xmath1 on milliarcsecond scales corresponds to only 0.6 times the radio power of cas  a.",
    "the limits that we place on the radio supernova populations in our target galaxies can be converted to radio supernova rates , if a few simplifying assumptions are made .",
    "conversion of a radio supernova rate to an overall supernova rate is most believable if we can make some estimate of the fraction of supernovae in our galaxies that should produce detectable radio supernovae .",
    "the radio emission from young type  ii supernovae in `` normal '' galactic environments typically is dominated by the interaction of the supernova blast wave with the mass - loss shell from the parent star @xcite . however , in the highest - density regions , such as sscs in dense molecular clouds , the supernova blast may be dominated by the high - density interstellar environment @xcite . in such a case ,",
    "the supernova ejecta will be slowed dramatically , particle acceleration at the shock front will be quite efficient , and radio emission will be both powerful and long - lived .",
    "thus , it appears to be a reasonable inference that _ every _ type  ii supernova in an ssc may produce significant radio emission ,    predictions of the supernova rates in our target galaxies may be derived from their populations of massive stars and the estimated lifetime of a radio supernova .",
    "the compact starburst regions in our target galaxies must contain roughly @xmath6 o7-equivalent stars in order to generate the ionizing flux that energizes the h@xmath13 and thermal radio emission .",
    "in the nearby galaxies ngc  253 @xcite and m82 @xcite , the radio flux densities of most young supernova remnants are relatively constant over periods of 815 years , implying that they stay near their radio peaks for periods of at least 20100 years .",
    "this supports the modeling of @xcite , but is in contrast to type ii radio supernovae in less dense environments , whose flux densities fall off with time @xmath47 as roughly @xmath48 to @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we may use the stellar contents and inferrred radio lifetimes discussed above to estimate the supernova rates expected in our program galaxies . roughly , the main - sequence lifetimes of massive young stars that go supernova range from @xmath50340  myr ( cf .",
    "starburst99 models of leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the supernova rate should peak about 46  myr after an instantaneous starburst .",
    "thus , if we assume that the massive stars all formed in a time of 13  myr , and that there are @xmath51 such stars , we should expect a radio supernova rate no higher than @xmath5015@xmath52  yr@xmath1 at a time about 57@xmath9  yr after the starburst . alternatively , one may take a quasi - instantaneous burst with a total mass of @xmath53 ; the starburst99 models @xcite then show a peak supernova rate of slightly less than @xmath4  yr@xmath1 about 6  myr after the burst .",
    "thus , as long as the typical radio supernova stays above @xmath54  w  hz@xmath1 for no more than a few hundred years , this is consistent with our lack of detection of any milliarcsecond radio sources in our three target galaxies .",
    "the upper limits to milliarcsecond - scale radio emission may be compared directly to galaxies with much higher global star formation rates in order to estimate the supernova rates in our galaxies .",
    "the two most extreme examples are arp  220 @xcite and arp  299 @xcite . in arp  299 , the primary nucleus ( `` a '' )",
    "has an approximate supernova rate of 0.6  yr@xmath1 @xcite , and contains @xmath55 milliarcsecond radio supernovae with 5  ghz powers in the range between @xmath56  w  hz@xmath1 and @xmath57  w  hz@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if the number of radio supernovae of flux density @xmath58 is a power - law @xmath59 , then one immediately finds that the number of radio supernovae in arp  299-a with 5  ghz powers above @xmath54  w  hz@xmath1 should range from @xmath60 for @xmath61 to @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "our three target galaxies have no radio supernovae detected above limits ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65  w  hz@xmath1 . as a rough estimate",
    "we take an upper limit of 1 supernova above @xmath54  w  hz@xmath1 for each galaxy ; scaling by the supernova rate in arp  299 , we thus find upper limits of @xmath66  yr@xmath1 for the supernova rate in each target galaxy , consistent with the expectation from the apparent stellar populations . , and the strong dependence of supernova radio powers on the local environments . ]    our results overall are consistent with the hypothesis that the starburst galaxies containing young radio supernovae or supernova remnants are those which have star formation over very large extents , rather than being dominated by one or a few sscs . despite the intense nature of their star formation in small volumes , dwarf galaxies such as those observed in this study do not have enough mass to generate a supernova rate that will lead to detection of young radio supernovae at present vlbi detection thresholds .",
    "we have used the vlbi high sensitivity array at milliarcsecond resolution to search for young radio supernovae in three nearby dwarf wolf - rayet starburst galaxies .",
    "no such supernovae were detected at radio power levels approximately equal to the power of cas  a. the non - detections are consistent with upper limits of less than @xmath3  yr@xmath1 for the supernova rates in the dwarf starburst galaxies , compared to an expected supernova rate of @xmath67  yr@xmath1 for starbursts of @xmath68 .",
    "we suggest the possibility that vla source  3 in he 2 - 10 includes one or more supernovae that are a few hundred to a few thousand years old , somewhat more powerful than cas  a , and with diameter(s ) greater than 0.5  pc , thus being undetectable in the present hsa observations .",
    "we expect that vlbi detection thresholds about 10 times fainter in our program galaxies , near 0.1 times the cas  a power , would begin to show partially resolved radio emission from supernova remnants with ages of a few thousand years .",
