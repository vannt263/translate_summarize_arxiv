    "solar metric radio bursts provide a unique diagnostic of the development of flare / coronal mass ejection ( cme ) events in the low corona . their onset and evolution ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . their signatures at metric to kilometric wavelengths trace disturbances propagating from the low corona to the interplanetary space .",
    "three types of nonthermal radio bursts are associated with the cme / flare events @xcite :    * bursts of the type iii family .",
    "they are produced by energetic electrons accelerated in the sun and traversing the solar atmosphere , along coronal magnetic lines rooted in its surface . in open field lines , they may escape into the interplanetary space ( see , for example , figure .",
    "1 of @xcite , also @xcite ) . in the dynamic spectra",
    ", these standard type iii bursts appear as fast drifting bands ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "when trapped in closed magnetic structures , they eventually turn toward the sun , resulting in inverted u- or j - shaped bursts in the dynamic spectra ( hence type - u or j bursts of the type iii family )",
    ". often , in flare / cme events , the transition from the type - u and j bursts to the typical type iii mark the restructuring , or opening , of the magnetic field lines as originally confined , energetic electrons gain access to open magnetic lines .",
    "an example of dynamic radio spectra showing this transition from u and j - type bursts to a standard type iii burst at the beginning of the 17 january 2005 event can be found in @xcite . in the hectometric and kilometric regime , long duration storms of individual type iii bursts",
    "@xcite covering several days ( 5.4 on average after   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were recorded .",
    "these are distinct from the hectometric  kilometric extensions of type iii bursts and are known as ip storms and , more often than not , may appear as storm continua on the dynamic spectra .",
    "the individual type iii components of the ip storms , ( micro - type iii bursts , after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are significantly weaker than the typical type iii bursts in the same frequency range .",
    "the ip storms are well associated with active regions @xcite yet the micro - type iii bursts are not accompanied by significant sxr flare activity .",
    "this implies the need of a persistent coronal store of suprathermal electrons @xcite supplying this type of activity . *",
    "type ii bursts .",
    "they are the radio signatures of the passage of a magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) shock wave through the tenuous plasma of the solar corona ; their radio emission is due to energetic electrons accelerated at the shock front .",
    "it is , in general , accepted that type ii bursts at decametric and longer wavelengths are driven by cmes , bow or flank @xcite . at the metric range , on the other hand , they might be also due , apart from cmes , to flare blasts or reconnection outflow termination - shocks @xcite .",
    "* type iv bursts .",
    "they are radio continua due to the radiation of energetic electrons trapped within magnetic structures and plasmoids .",
    "they have been recorded in almost all frequency ranges starting from the microwaves as type bursts and the decimetric range as @xcite . in the metric wavelengths the type ivm bursts are divided into moving ( ivma or ivm ) and stationary ( ivmb ) .",
    "the type ivmb bursts emanate from stationary magnetic structures usually located above active regions or post - eruption arcades behind cmes @xcite .",
    "the type ivm burst are , sometimes , referenced as flare continua ( fcm when preceding a type ivma or fcii when following a type ii burst , see   * ? ? ?",
    "they are also identified as continuum noise storms ( type ivsa and ivsb , corresponding to type ivma and ivmb , see discussion in   * ? ? ?",
    "*  and their figure 14 ) .",
    "the type ivma bursts @xcite appear moving outwards at velocities of the order of 1001000 km @xmath3 comparable to cme speeds @xcite ; they sometimes last more than ten minutes .",

    "the ar 9957 , ar 9958 , ar 9960 , ar 9962 , ar 9963 complex , located in the ne quadrant of the disk , gave 10 c - class and one m1.5 sxr flares .",

    "the positional angles indicate that they emerged from all quadrants of the solar disk .",
    "this activity was associated with many type iii burst - groups , 23 type ii shocks in the metric range ( see the table included as supplementary online material ) and a persistent continuum appearing on the ne quadrant over the ar 9957 , ar 9958 , ar 9960 , ar 9962 , ar 9963 group during the 1923 may period .",

    "there are only two wide cmes , a halo on 27 may at 11:06 ut and a rather wide cme on 28 may at 10:26 ut , which almost mark the start and the end of the event .",
    "similar to the 1822 may 2002 event , in section ( [ over01 ] ) , there is also a persistent coronal type iv , which appears over ar 8552 ( n18e31 ) on the nrh records .",

    "there is also a long series of type iii bursts and groups , which covers the type @xmath0  interval .",
    "most of these type iii bursts , however , overshoot the type @xmath0  continuum so we expect that the main source of energetic electrons is its coronal counterpart persisting over ar8552 .",
    "the end of the 2728 may 1999 event coincides with the wide cme mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph .",
    "on 17 january 2005 two fast cmes were recorded in close succession during two distinct episodes of a 3b / x3.8 flare from the ar 10720 .",
    "the type @xmath0   burst started at 10:55 ut on 17 january and ended by 18 january at 02:00 ut ( event catalog number 14 ) , for an overview of the dynamic spectrum see figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the coronal extension of the type @xmath0  burst was found to originate from ar10720 and persisted throughout the duration of its interplanetary counterpart .",
    "the type ii activity , on the other hand , was restricted to the frequency range below 14 mhz .",
    "the type iii groups accompanying the event were found to overshoot the low frequency limit of the type @xmath0  burst at least after 08:18 ut .",
    "earlier , groups of type u bursts and type iv fine structures indicated acceleration and partial trapping of electrons behind the cme front .    a detailed study of the radio signatures of this event ( table 1 in   * ? ? ?",
    "* that presents a comprehensive outline of its time evolution ) points towards possible multiple acceleration mechanisms .",
    "these include cme associated shocks in the high corona and the interplanetary space , and also , shock  independent accelerators at low altitudes associated with the type iv continuum behind the cme .",
    "this event had distinct features of the compact class , associated with an intense flare and two fast cmes , yet its long duration characterizes it as extended .",
    "similar to the previous two long duration events , the energetic electrons provided by low corona sources are well associated with the coronal type iv burst .",
    "of the 48  type @xmath0  bursts of our sample 45 , classified as compact , were found to conform to the big flare syndrome which suggests that , statistically , energetic phenomena are more intense in larger flares , regardless of the detailed physics .",
    "in fact 19  were associated with x - class flares and 21  with m - class with only five  events related to c - class flares.this represents a significant deviation with respect to the general goes sxr flare distribution studied by . in the general case it is expected that @xmath966% of the sxr flares are of class c with @xmath99.5% of class m and just @xmath90.7% of class x .. the general case is , also , consistent with the power - law distribution of the peak sxr flux [ i ] , where the probability density , @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "as regards the cme compact - event association , 32   of these events were trailing cmes with speeds @xmath91400 km s@xmath1 on average with only 11  events having cmes slower than ( 600900 km s@xmath1 range ) .",
    "this deviates significantly from the lasco cme distribution from 1998 to 2011 .",
    "the comparison of the distributions is presented in figure [ cmespeed ] .",
    "the same cmes were found , systematically , in the @xmath9360@xmath5  tail of the width distribution ( see figure [ cmewidth ] ) .",
    "these fast and wide cmes were expected to transport the type iv emitting energetic electrons confined within their cavities .",
    "@xcite calculated that the electrons accelerated during the cme initiation or early propagation phase , trapped in the magnetic structure of the cme , do not need to be replenished for times of the order of four hours .",
    "this is consistent with the duration of the compact type iv bursts which is , on average , about 106 minutes .",
    "furthermore , 43  compact events were characterized by a cme preceding by some hours the associated fast cme along the same path ( similar measured position angle in the lasco cme catalog ) could have reduced the propagation drag of the trailing cme .",
    "contrary to the discussion in the previous paragraph , during the interval from 28 october 2003 at 11:30 ut to 29 october at 10:17 ut , no cme was reported in the soho / lasco catalog , yet two type @xmath0  bursts , in close succession , were recorded by the _ wind_/waves .",
    "these correspond to entries 28 and 29 in the attached online table and represent two compact events associated with m - class flares . in the column with remarks of the cme catalog , at the line corresponding to the 28 october 2003 11:30 halo cme and the associated x17.2 flare ,",
    "it is noted that `` _ _ all images after 13:00 ut , particularly c3 , are severely degraded due to the ongoing proton storm _ _ '' .",
    "the non - detection of cmes associated with the events on 28 and 29 may can , therefore , be due to this fact .      as regards the threeextended or long duration type @xmath0  events ,",
    "they seem to need a resupply of the continuum as they last from 960 min to 115 hours ( examples in figures [ dynspec19990527 ] and [ dynspec20020518 ] ) ; this requirement holds regardless of the intensity and speed of the first associated flare / cme .",
    "now the energetic electron sources in the corona manifest themselves as metric  decametric type iii and type iv radio bursts .",
    "these electron sources need be associated with the lift off and propagation of cmes as they deform the solar magnetic field providing a propagation path for the energetic electrons and , at the same time , a moving magnetic trap .    in the examples of extended interplanetary type iv bursts discussed in sections [ over01 ] , [ over01b ] and [ over01c ] we see the replenishment process , mentioned above , at work . in all cases we have , in addition to the dynamic spectra , a partial coverage with nrh images .",
    "the energetic electron sources in the corona manifesting themselves as metric and decametric type iv radio bursts persist , in the same position , for the duration of each of the interplanetary type iv bursts .",
    "there are , however , other possible sources of energetic electrons .",
    "firstly , the type iii bursts ; these appear to extend in the dynamic spectra far beyond the low frequency limits of the type @xmath0  bursts ; therefore , a mechanism of electron deposition into the type @xmath0  is not easily envisaged .",
    "the type iii  like activity , however , embedded within the type iv continua as part of the type iv fine structure is linked to the type iv energetic population and the corresponding acceleration process .",
    "another kind of type iii  like activity , are the micro - type iii bursts which are parts of the ip storms .",
    "as they are significantly weaker than the standard type iii ( six orders of magnitude , see * ? ?",
    "* ) they are difficult to detect , especially in the presence of type iiis but they can not be ruled out .    secondly , the type @xmath0  replenishment from the shock accelerated electrons is considered .",
    "the type ii bursts appear , mostly , piston driven by cmes and preceding the type iv continuum , interplanetary and coronal , which evolves in their wake , possibly within the cme core .",
    "this implies a sort of magnetic isolation from energetic populations in the vicinity of the cme bow shock .",
    "this been said , we note that the possibility of acceleration in the low corona by shocks distinct from those preceding the type iv can not be precluded ; the observational confirmation is difficult however as these are often burried in other types of radio activity .",
    "the present study is based on a multi  frequency and multi  instrument study of a sample of 48  interplanetary type iv ( type @xmath0 ) bursts identified from the _",
    "wind_/waves  on line catalog .",
    "the dynamic spectra obtained from the _ wind_/waves  r1 and r2 receivers , in the hectometric frequency range , were combined with metric and decametric dynamic spectra and supplemented with goes sxr light curves and lasco cme data .    in most cases , 45  out of 48 , the extension of a metric ",
    "decametric moving type iv bursts in the hectometric frequency range was found to be associated to a fast and wide cme ( see section [ charcompact ] ) capable of driving the embedded type iv source into the high corona .",
    "this type of bursts have duration of about 106 minute , on average ; they were dubbed compact type @xmath0  bursts . the reduced aerodynamic drag in the wake of a previous cme , along the same propagation path , appears to increase the probability of the appearance of a type @xmath0  burst .",
    "this preconditioning of interplanetary space by a previous cme was first proposed , before the discovery of cmes , by @xcite who stated that a disturbance following a preceding disturbance encounters much more regular conditions than the first .",
    "this result corresponds to the effect of cmes on the structure of the ambient magnetic field and solar wind flow which in turn controls the propagation behavior of trailing cmes as discussed in a number of publications .",
    "the basic argument , in all cases , is that a cme may be subject to a minimal slow down in the wake of a preceding cme , as it encounters a preconditioned region of depleted ambient plasma density and almost radial magnetic field lines ; within this region a reduced aerodynamic drag is expected .",
    "the efficiency of this effect increases , possibly , if the main cme is quite dense .",
    "it is also expected that a wide preceding cme would result in a greater drop of the aerodynamic drag compared to a narrow cme along the path of the main cme .",
    "further complications may arise due to more than one cme , preceding the main cme , to the projection effects as regards cme paths and speeds and the ambiguities in cme mass calculations . despite these ,",
    "this report provides qualitative support to the reduced aerodynamic drag due to preconditioning hypothesis .",
    "apart from the preconditioning of space by a preceding cme , discussed in the previous paragraph , the characteristics of these events were consistent with the big flare syndrome since they were mostly associated with medium to large flares and fast cmes ( see section [ charcompact ] ) .",
    "as regards the small number ( five  of 45 ) of events associated with smaller flares we found that either the type iv burst was originating at the solar limb ( numbers 37 and 44 in the attached table ) or ( numbers 35 , 42 , and 43 ) the origin of the flare was not known ; in both cases the flare association was quite uncertain .",
    "there were also intense flares within the period of interest , 19982012 , which did not give type @xmath0  bursts .",
    "this may be interpreted , at least in part , by the fact that in the _ wind_/waves  catalog some are not listed as type iv bursts . on 20 january 2005 , for example the interplanetary radio signature of the x7.1/2b flare accompanied by a fast ( @xmath12900 km s@xmath1 ) halo cme was described as very diffuse .",
    "the same holds for the major solar eruption of 7 march 2012 ( x5.4 and x1.3 flares associated with two fast ( @xmath13 km s@xmath1 ) cmes , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this is mentioned as strong intermittent multiple tones .    in the three  long duration , or extended , type @xmath0   bursts , the energetic electron population , which is the type @xmath0  source , seems to be replenished from the lower solar corona .",
    "this implies the possibility of a connection of the type @xmath0  enclosing magnetic structure to low coronal electron accelerators or coronal reservoirs .",
    "the nrh images , when available , indicate that these are possibly associated to the high frequency type iv which persists throughout the duration of the extended type @xmath0   burst .",
    "a steady coronal reservoir of energetic electrons appears to be the metric type iv continuum as most of the type iiis tend to overshoot the interplanetary type iv .",
    "the micro - type iii bursts , on the other hand , may trace the electrons path from the coronal reservoir to the type @xmath0 .",
    "we state , at this point , that the term coronal reservoir is used in order to distinguish from the heliospheric reservoirs beyond 1au .",
    "the fact that the extended type @xmath0  bursts appear to result , cumulatively , from relatively small energetic events , suggests the presence of some type of trapping structure for the exciter energetic electrons . the type @xmath0  heliocentric distances , however , are @xmath9 2595@xmath7  which are quite smaller than the 1au , and beyond , distance of the heliospheric reservoirs .",
    "the question of the confinement of the energetic electrons , producing this type of bursts , at heliocentric distances of the order of some tens of @xmath7   remains open .",
    "this research has been partly cofinanced by the european union ( european social fund esf ) and greek national funds through the operational program education and lifelong learning of the national strategic reference framework ( nsrf ) - research funding program : thales . investing in knowledge society through the european social fund .",

    "<S> we study the characteristics of moving type iv radio bursts which extend to the hectometric wavelengths ( interplanetary type iv or type @xmath0  bursts ) and their relationship with energetic phenomena on the sun . </S>",
    "<S> our dataset comprises 48  interplanetary type iv bursts observed with the radio and plasma wave investigation ( waves ) instrument onboard wind in the 13.825 mhz20 khz frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic spectra of the _ radio solar telescope network _ ( rstn ) , the _ nanay decametric array _ ( dam ) , the _ appareil de routine pour le traitement et l enregistrement magnetique de l information spectral _ ( artemis - iv ) , the culgoora , hiraiso and izmiran _ radio spectrographs _ were used to track the evolution of the events in the low corona . </S>",
    "<S> these were supplemented with soft x - ray ( sxr ) flux - measurements from the _ geostationary operational environmental satellite _ ( goes ) and coronal mass ejections ( cme ) data from the _ large angle and spectroscopic coronagraph _ ( lasco ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) . </S>",
    "<S> positional information of the coronal bursts was obtained by the _ nanay radioheliograph _ ( nrh ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the relationship of the type iv events with coronal radio bursts , cmes and sxr flares . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the events ( 45 ) were characterized as compact ; their duration was on average 106 minutes . </S>",
    "<S> this type of events was , mostly , associated with m- and x - class flares ( 40  out of 45 ) and fast cmes ; 32  of these events had cmes faster than 1000 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in 43  compact  events the cme was , possibly , subjected to reduced aerodynamic drag as it was propagating in the wake of a previous cme . </S>",
    "<S> a minority ( three ) of long lived type @xmath0  bursts was detected , with duration from 960 minutes to 115 hours . </S>",
    "<S> these events are referred to as extended or long duration and appear to replenish their energetic electron content , possibly from electrons escaping from the corresponding coronal type iv bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the latter were found to persist on the disk , for tens of hours to days . </S>",
    "<S> prominent among them was the unusual interplanetary type iv burst of 18 - 23 may 2002 , which is the longest event in the _ wind_/waves   catalog . </S>",
    "<S> the three   extended events were , usually , accompanied by a number of flares , of goes class c in their majority , and of cmes , many of which were slow and narrow . </S>"
