    "strongly interacting matter at high temperature or large net baryon number density is expected to undergo a transition from a phase where chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously to one where chiral symmetry is restored . at vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) ,",

    "a large experimental as well as theoretical effort is invested into the exploration of the qcd phase diagram and the development of appropriate tools and observables that can provide clear - cut signals for the existence of phase transitions and their universal properties . in this context , fluctuations  @xcite , in particular fluctuations of net charges  @xcite ,",
    "may prove useful .",
    "critical behavior is connected with long range correlations and enhanced fluctuations , due to the appearance of soft modes in the neighborhood of a phase transition .",
    "fluctuations of baryon number and electric charge have been shown to reflect the critical behavior of the chiral transition @xcite . in the exploration of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero temperature and baryon chemical potential ,",
    "higher order cumulants of the net baryon number play a particularly important role , since they diverge on the chiral phase transition line in the chiral limit ( vanishing light quark masses , @xmath3 ) and at the conjectured chiral critical end point .    here",
    "i will discuss robust features of cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations that can be extracted from considerations based on @xmath0 universality , on existing lattice calculations and on model calculations  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been emphasized that also the deconfinement transition can be accurately characterized by exploring fluctuations  @xcite . in this case",
    "the relevant fluctuations are those of the polyakov loop , the order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath4 center symmetry in pure gauge theory .",
    "i briefly discuss how this may be used to analyze the deconfinement transition  @xcite .",
    "in studies of critical fluctuations in nucleus - nucleus collisions , the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , serves as a baseline , since it describes bulk observables  @xcite and does not exhibit critical behavior . for sufficiently small quark masses ,",
    "the fluctuations close to the pseudo critical transition line @xmath5 are expected to reflect the universal properties @xcite of the 3-dimensional , @xmath0 symmetric , spin model @xcite . for fluctuations of the net baryon number ,",
    "the @xmath0 scaling properties of high order cumulants differ qualitatively from the predictions of the hrg model .",
    "lattice calculations of cumulants of the net baryon number and electric charge , performed in the transition region at vanishing baryon chemical potential and non - zero quark mass , are indeed consistent with the @xmath0 universality class  @xcite .",
    "moreover , lattice studies of ( 2 + 1 ) flavor qcd  @xcite show that for physical light quark masses , the magnetic equation of state is in the @xmath6 scaling regime .",
    "thus , we can expect that the critical fluctuations at the chiral transition are reflected in suitably chosen observables , which may then be used to pin down the crossover transition in strongly interacting matter .",
    "as i will argue , this is indeed the case for higher cumulants of net charges  @xcite .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the particle multiplicities are well described in a thermal model using the partition function of a hadron resonance gas @xcite .",
    "the analysis of data obtained within the hrg model at high beam energies , corresponding to small values of the baryon chemical potential , suggest that the freeze - out curve @xmath7 is close to the expected qcd phase boundary .",
    "indeed , at @xmath1 the chemical freeze - out seems to occur at or very close to the qcd crossover transition  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the critical fluctuations of the chiral transition are reflected in fluctuations of , e.g. , net charges .    at @xmath8 ,",
    "the higher cumulants of net charges can be computed within lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "eventually such calculations will provide a systematic theoretical framework for unravelling the relation of the freeze - out conditions at rhic and lhc energies and the pseudo - critical line in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "however , at present lattice calculations provide only limited information on sixth and higher order cumulants .",
    "viable alternatives for discussing qualitative features of the net baryon number fluctuations is offered by o(4 ) scaling theory and by chiral effective models . in particular ,",
    "effective models have the advantage that they can be extended to @xmath2 with a tractable effort . on the other hand , a clear disadvantage of such models",
    "is that they do not account for the potentially important contribution from resonances in the hadronic phase .",

    "@xmath11 higher order derivatives of the free energy density with respect to temperature or chemical potential are dominated by the non - analytic ( singular ) part , @xmath12 .",
    "the explicit dependence of the free energy on the chemical potentials of electric charge and strangeness as well as on the strange quark mass is suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the singular part of the free energy may be written in the scaling form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are critical exponents of the 3-dimensional @xmath0 spin model  @xcite , @xmath16 is a constant , and the reduced temperature and the symmetry breaking external field are given by  @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the critical temperature in the chiral limit while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are non - universal scale parameters @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the reduced temperature @xmath21 on the quark chemical potential @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , is fixed by charge conjugation symmetry and by requiring that the curvature of the chiral phase boundary at small @xmath24 is reproduced  @xcite .",

    "@xmath34 where i have introduced the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath35 , using the scaling relation @xmath36 .    because @xmath35 is negative for @xmath0 spin systems in 3 dimensions ( @xmath37 @xcite )",
    ", all cumulants of the net baryon number of order @xmath38 , remain finite at the second order transition in the chiral limit ( @xmath39 ) for @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the first divergent cumulant is obtained for @xmath41 . at non - zero @xmath22 ,",
    "the odd derivatives survive and the @xmath42 cumulant is the first one to diverge in the chiral limit .",

    "( [ fluct_mass ] ) , one finds the leading singularity in the chiral limit , @xmath44 where @xmath45 hence , the singular part of @xmath46 , which is proportional to @xmath47 , has the same structure as that of the specific heat ; it is proportional to the second derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature .",
    "universality arguments imply  @xcite that in the chiral limit , the cumulants @xmath48 of order @xmath49 are all positive for @xmath50 and alternate in sign for @xmath51 .",

    "nonetheless , the non - analytic term in @xmath46 varies rapidly with temperature , leading to a pronounced maximum in the transition region , observed in lattice as well as in model calculations .",
    "the temperature at which @xmath53 changes sign is non - universal since it depends on the magnitude of the regular terms .",
    "however , in the scaling regime the location of the extrema and the corresponding amplitudes follow universal scaling laws , as discussed in @xcite .",

    "@xcite , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , one finds @xmath64 and @xmath65 at @xmath59 .",
    "thus , as expected , the strength of the singularity grows with the order of the cumulant .",
    "we now focus on the properties of the sixth order cumulant , @xmath66 , or correspondingly on the ratio of cumulants @xmath67 . based on the characteristics of the scaling function , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic ] , it is clear that for a sufficiently small , but non - zero , quark mass , @xmath66 has a maximum in the hadronic phase , close to the transition region and then drops rapidly .",
    "furthermore , just above the critical temperature in the chiral limit , @xmath66 is negative and exhibits a sharp minimum .",

    "in particular , for the discussion below , it is important that @xmath69 in the vicinity of the pseudo - critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the rapid temperature dependence makes the sixth order cumulant a potential probe of the chiral crossover transition in heavy ion collisions . indeed ,",
    "if the freeze - out occurs in a temperature range close to the chiral crossover temperature , as indicated by the hrg analysis of particle multiplicities  @xcite , one would expect the data to show a negative sixth order cumulant , in striking contrast to the hrg result , @xmath70 . in fig .",

    "higher order cumulants , e.g. @xmath74 , also show a characteristic behavior near the chiral transition , owing to the singular part of the free energy  @xcite . as noted above",
    ", the strength of the singularity , and thus the signature of critical fluctuations , grows with the order of the cumulant .",
    "therefore , one may naively imagine that the prospects for unraveling the qcd chiral transition could be improved by considering higher cumulants . however , this advantage is counterbalanced by the problems , which arise because with increasing order the cumulants are more and more sensitive to the tail of the probability distribution  @xcite .",

    "in order to explore whether the rapid temperature dependence of @xmath76 can indeed be utilized to track the phase boundary , one must extend the discussion to non - vanishing baryon chemical potential .",
    "this is done in a chiral model , the polyakov loop extended quark meson model ( pqm ) , within the framework of the functional renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the chiral transition of the pqm model belongs to the universality class of the 3-dimensional @xmath0 spin system , while deconfinement is modeled by a @xmath77 symmetric effective potential for the polyakov loop .",
    "thus , in the light quark mass limit , this model yields the universal scaling functions , discussed in the previous section .",

    "the basic features discussed here for net baryon number fluctuations also carry over to electric charge fluctuations , as indicated by lattice and model calculations  @xcite .",

    ", the star collaboration finds that also the ratio @xmath89 is suppressed relative to the hadron resonance gas  @xcite .",

    "however , a quantitative interpretation of the energy and centrality dependence of the cumulants is not yet available .",
    "the deconfinement transition of qcd is connected with spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath77 center symmetry of color @xmath92 .",

    ", the order parameter varies smoothly , and does not provide an accurate signature for the transition temperature .",
    "moreover , in yang - mills theory on a lattice the polyakov loop exhibits finite size effects , which smoothens the first order transition , and thus complicates the determination of the transition temperature .",
    "it has been shown that the polyakov loop susceptibilities , in particular their ratios , offer a useful probe of deconfinement , also in full qcd with dynamical light quarks  @xcite .",
    "for the color gauge groups @xmath95 , the polyakov loop is complex - valued .",
