    "as input to the many - body calculation we take the two - body low momentum potential @xmath6  @xcite , which is derived from realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction models by integrating out the high momentum modes in the sense of the rg . here , we briefly summarize the properties of @xmath6 and refer to the original papers and ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the rg decimation to low momenta is constructed such that @xmath6 is energy - independent and reproduces the half - on - shell @xmath7 matrix for momenta below a cutoff @xmath8 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "we thus have @xmath10 consequently , @xmath6 is phase shift equivalent to the original nucleon - nucleon interaction . for values of the cutoff , @xmath11 ( the scale up to which the potential models are fitted to empirical phase shifts ) ,",
    "one finds the same low momentum potential for the various realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions , i.e. , the resulting potential is model independent , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ vlowkdiag ] .    in @xmath6 , the model - dependent high momentum ( short distance ) modes have been integrated out .",
    "this procedure tames the strong short - range repulsion in the original interaction .",
    "thus , the low momentum interaction @xmath6 can , in contrast to the bare interaction , be used directly in many - body calculations .",
    "furthermore , since the states above the cutoff @xmath8 are included in @xmath6 and those below are not , the cutoff acts much like the pauli - blocking operator in the brueckner @xmath12 matrix  @xcite . by analyzing the angle - averaged pauli blocking operator",
    ", one finds an effective cutoff slightly larger than the fermi momentum .",
    "here we employ a density - dependent cutoff for @xmath6 , @xmath13 . due to the separation of short distance and long distance scales ,",
    "@xmath6 is almost independent of the cutoff in the @xmath14 channel  @xcite for @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the exact value of the cutoff is not crucial for pure neutron matter .",
    "we now discuss the rg approach to the many - fermion problem .",
    "as originally proposed by shankar  @xcite , one separates the slow modes from the fast ones in a many - fermion system by introducing a momentum cutoff relative to the fermi momentum . at zero temperature",
    ", the phase space for fast modes is then characterized by the occupation factors @xmath18 the slow modes that make up the model space are then located in the complementary shell of thickness @xmath19 around the fermi surface .",
    "starting at a large cutoff ( @xmath20 ) , where the effective interaction in the model space is assumed to be given by the free - space low momentum interaction @xmath6 , it is successively renormalized by including the contributions of fast intermediate states lying in a thin shell between @xmath21 and @xmath8 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "one obtains a differential ( rg ) equation for the renormalization of the effective interaction as a function of the cutoff .",
    "as @xmath8 is decreased , more and more modes are shifted from the model space into the effective interaction , in such a way that the low energy scattering amplitude remains invariant . at the same time",
    "the single - particle degrees of freedom are gradually converted into quasiparticles .",
    "as @xmath23 , the effective interaction equals the scattering amplitude for quasiparticles on the fermi surface , since all modes have been integrated out . to one - loop order ,",
    "the rg equation in the particle - hole channels , which play a special role in fermi liquid theory , is at zero temperature given by  @xcite @xmath24 & \\times a\\bigl({{\\bf q}},\\frac{{{\\bf p}+{\\bf p'}}}{2}+\\frac{{{\\bf q'}}}{2}-{{\\bf p''}};{\\lambda}\\bigr ) \\ ; a\\bigl({{\\bf q}},{{\\bf p''}}-\\frac{{{\\bf",

    "\\label{rge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the contributions from the direct and the exchange channel are shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ zsandzsp ] . when only one channel is considered , the one - loop rg equation is exact in the sense that it is equivalent to the corresponding scattering equation . within the rg method ,",
    "the scattering amplitude remains antisymmetric at any - loop order when both particle - hole channels are included .",
    "( 125,43 ) ( 2,0 ) ( 28,26)@xmath25 ( 18,29)@xmath8 ( 18,34)@xmath8 ( 46,12)fast hole ( 41,35)fast particle ( 57,0 ) ( 92,6 )    we choose a scattering geometry , where the external particles are restricted to the fermi surface , @xmath26 .",
    "then , the scattering amplitude depends only on two angles , or equivalently the magnitude of the two momenta @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the direct and exchange channels couple in the rg equation , eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) .",
    "microscopically the rg in the particle - hole channels includes particle - hole bubbles and ladders as well as vertex corrections . at this point",
    "we include only the high - momentum ladder diagrams summed in @xmath6 in the particle - particle channel .",
    "finally , the effective interaction of particles on the fermi surface is obtained by setting @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ rge ] )  @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective interaction includes the so - called induced interaction .",
    "we solve the rg equation , eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) , for neutron matter ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the evolution of the effective mass as well as an approximate treatment of the renormalization of the quasiparticle strength is included in the flow .",
    "we note that the rg approach does not require a truncation in landau @xmath30 of the fermi liquid parameters .",
    "the resulting landau parameters are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( 125,65 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 72,31 )    while the fermi liquid parameters are defined in the forward scattering limit , the rg procedure yields the quasiparticle scattering amplitude also for finite scattering angles .",
    "the latter can be used to compute the s - wave superfluid gap . in weak coupling bcs theory ,",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the angle averaged scattering amplitude on the fermi surface , we find the pairing gap shown in fig .",
    "[ 1s0gaps ] .",
    "the s - wave gap is strongly suppressed , from @xmath33 to @xmath34 at maximum , due to particle - hole screening in the many - body medium .",
    "this agrees well with the results obtained in the polarization potential model by wambach _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    at higher densities ,",
    "neutrons form a p - wave ( @xmath35p@xmath36@xmath35f@xmath36 ) superfluid . for fermions interacting by means of a delta function force ,",
    "the second order particle - hole contributions to the p - wave scattering amplitude are attractive for back - to - back configurations on the fermi surface , and thus one expects the p - wave gap to increase . for a quantitative analysis of pairing in this channel , however , the effects of tensor and spin - orbit forces in the medium must be included .",
    "here we briefly discuss the noncentral parts of the effective two - nucleon interaction . in a nuclear medium ,",
    "new spin - dependent interactions are induced by the presence of other particles nearby .",
    "the polarization of the fermi sea leads to contributions , which depend on the two - body cm momentum @xmath37 in the rest frame of the many - body system . in the long - wavelength landau limit ,",
    "two of these new operators survive , a modified spin - orbit term @xmath38 , which does not conserve two - particle spin , and a tensor term @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , relativistic corrections related to the transformation from the two - body cm frame to the rest frame of the many - body system also contribute to such nonstandard operators  @xcite .",
    "neither of these effects are included in conventional many - body calculations , where the two - body interaction is treated in the independent pair approximation .",
    "a calculation of the effective tensor and spin - orbit interactions in nuclear matter is in progress  @xcite .",
