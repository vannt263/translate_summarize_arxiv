    "many models of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking predict that at least one of the susy partners of the top quark is sufficiently light such that pair production is possible at a future linear collider with c.m.energies below 1  tev .",
    "in such a scenario threshold studies are feasible , where squark pairs are produced with small relative velocities , and which allow for precise measurements of squark masses , lifetimes or couplings in close analogy to threshold measurements at the top - antitop pair threshold  @xcite .",
    "if the susy partner of the gluon is ( as is general expected ) not much lighter than the electroweak scale , then the low - energy qcd dynamics of squarks is , up to the fact that we are dealing with a colored spinless state , based on standard qcd with interactions carried by spin-1 gluons in the adjoint representation .",
    "it is a special feature of pair production of heavy colored particles close to the two - particle threshold that multi - gluon exchange leads to singular terms @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the amplitude at @xmath2-loop perturbation theory , where @xmath3 is the relative particle velocity .",
    "thus for @xmath4 , which corresponds to a region in c.m.energy of roughly @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the heavy particle mass , the singular terms have to be summed to all orders in @xmath7 .",
    "this is achieved most efficiently within an effective field theory . for top pair threshold production the effective theory vnrqcd (  velocity non - relativistic qcd \" )  @xcite was developed to carry out this summation program aiming for nnll order precision , i.e.accounting for @xmath8 qcd  @xcite as well as @xmath9 electroweak corrections  @xcite . for squark - antisquark pair threshold production previous studies involved leading - logarithmic ( ll ) precision  @xcite .",
    "higher order qcd or electroweak effects were not taken into account in a systematic manner , although it is known from the top threshold that corrections to the ll approximation can be substantial .    in this work we present the vnrqcd lagrangian for a particle - antiparticle pair of heavy non - relativistic colored scalars in the fundamental representation of qcd .",
    "we provide matching conditions and anomalous dimensions required for renormalization group improved computations of threshold pair production at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) order and scalar - antiscalar bound state energies at nnll order in the non - relativistic expansion . for our presentation",
    "we follow closely the conventions and notations of refs",
    ".  @xcite . among the crucial elements of the construction",
    "are that vnrqcd is obtained by a single matching procedure at the hard scale @xmath6 and that the soft and the ultrasoft renormalization scales , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are correlated according to the non - relativistic energy - momentum relation of a heavy particle at all times .",
