    "when one wants to analyze a certain class of low - dimensional topological objects , having in mind in particular the exploitation of computers to enumerate and classify them , one is naturally faced with the need of two tools as follows :    * an efficient combinatorial encoding of the objects under investigation ; * for each object , a numerical measure of how complicated the object is .    for closed orientable @xmath3-manifolds , item ( 1 )",
    "is realized taking triangulations .",
    "these would also work for item ( 2 ) , but it actually turned out over the time that matveev s theory of complexity  @xcite defined through simple spines is highly preferable , for the following reasons :    * matveev s complexity @xmath11 is defined for each @xmath2 , and , if @xmath2 is prime , either @xmath12 , or @xmath13 is the minimal number of tetrahedra in a triangulation of @xmath2 ; * @xmath9 is additive under connected sum ; * while performing a computer enumeration of the prime @xmath2 s with a given @xmath13 , the extra flexibility deriving from the definition of @xmath9 through spines provides very useful computational shortcuts .    besides closed orientable @xmath3-manifolds ,",
    "perhaps the next more natural objects one can want to understand and enumerate within @xmath3-dimensional topology are the pairs @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary closed orientable @xmath3-manifold and @xmath4 is a link .",
    "this paper is devoted to developing a complexity theory for such pairs , mimicking matveev s one .",
    "the definition of the complexity @xmath6 is actually a variation of that already given in  @xcite for @xmath3-orbifolds , and exploited in  @xcite for pairs @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a trivalent graph .",
    "however , specializing to links we will be able to establish more accurate results , and to compare complexity with other known invariants .",
    "one of the main tools we will employ is a reduction of matveev s recent beautiful _ root _",
    "theory  @xcite .",
    "this theory applies to pairs @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is again a graph , and its aim is to provide a version for such pairs of the celebrated haken - kneser - milnor theorem , asserting that each closed @xmath3-manifold can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime ones . roughly speaking ,",
    "a root of @xmath14 is the result of cutting @xmath14 as long as possible along _ essential _ spheres intersecting @xmath15 transversely in at most @xmath3 points .",
    "matveev s main achievement in  @xcite is then the proof that the root is essentially unique .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * we will derive from  @xcite the fact that for many pairs @xmath1 the complexity @xmath6 defined through simple spines is actually the minimal number of tetrahedra in a triangulation of @xmath2 containing @xmath7 in its @xmath8-skeleton ; this is the case for instance if @xmath16 and @xmath7 is a prime non - split link ; * we will define a @xmath10-root as the result of cutting a pair @xmath17 as long as possible along essential spheres meeting @xmath7 in either @xmath18 or @xmath19 points , and we will prove that such a root is essentially unique ; * we will prove that there are infinitely many distinct pairs @xmath17 in which every separating sphere meeting @xmath7 in either @xmath18 or @xmath19 points is inessential , but containing non - separating spheres meeting @xmath7 in @xmath19 points ; this shows in our opinion that there is a non - negligible difference between root theory for pairs @xmath17 and the haken - kneser - milnor theorem for manifolds ; * we will show that the complexity of @xmath17 is always equal to the sum of the complexities of the components of its @xmath10-root ; * we will prove that complexity is always additive under connected sum away from the link , and it is additive also under connected sum along the link except in a situation that we will carefully describe ; * for links in @xmath20 , we will compare the complexity with the crossing number @xmath21 , proving in particular for prime alternating knots that @xmath9 is bounded from above by a linear function of @xmath21 , and from below by a linear function of @xmath22 ; we will also analyze two specific infinite series of knots , for which we can give much sharper upper and lower estimates ; * we will compare the complexity of a link with the hyperbolic volume of its exterior , showing that for certain families of links these two quantities are rather closely related , while they can not be in general .",
