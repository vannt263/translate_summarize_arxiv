    "the field of quantum computation is one of the fastest developing areas in modern physics . in order to perform quantum computation",
    "one needs to have a full and precise information about the parameters of quantum bit evolution in the set - up used .",
    "this makes quantum hamiltonian parameter estimation one of the crucial problems in this area .",
    "the most common approach involves repeatedly initiating the system in some state and then performing a measurement after some time when the system is allowed to evolve under its hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the choice of input states , evolution times , measurement bases and method of information treatment defines the estimation algorithm .",
    "various approaches to the problem were suggested , including quantum process tomography @xcite and fourier analysis @xcite .",
    "quantum process tomography requires a full control over state preparation and measurement which could be a hard task .",
    "in addition , often the preparation is done by using strong measurement in a certain basis which one can change only using evolution of the quantum bit ( qubit ) itself which is impossible without already knowing the hamiltonian parameters . thus finding algorithms which are able to work using a fixed basis",
    "is required .",
    "fourier analysis method is inspired by classical signal processing .",
    "it involves repeated measurements after longer and longer evolution times and signal frequency reconstruction using inverse fourier transform .",
    "however , it requires a large number of measurements to achieve moderate precision .",
    "i.e. , in @xcite it took @xmath0 measurements to achieve @xmath1 joint variance in a two - parameter qubit hamiltonian estimation .    in order to completely use the information of each measurement it is necessary to use a bayesian approach .",
    "it consists of representing the knowledge of an unknown parameter in terms of probability distribution and updating it according to the sequence of measurement outcomes .",
    "this approach is closely related to phase estimation techniques , which however also employ arbitrary states preparation @xcite .",
    "the particular problem considered in this paper is inspired by the developments in 2-electron double quantum dot ( dqd ) systems which can be successfully used for creating quantum bits and performing gate operations , in particular gaas double quantum dots @xcite .",
    "in such systems qubit evolution is driven by a difference in @xmath2-component of magnetic field @xmath3 between the parts of the dqd .",
    "this field is due to the hyperfine interaction of the electrons spins with atoms nearby lattice and so it is not stable and ca nt be controlled .",
    "precise and quick measurement of this field is therefore crucial for quantum processing .",
    "one of the important limitations imposed by this system is a slow and complicated measurement process which requires considerably more time than the evolution ( @xmath4s vs several nanoseconds ) . in order to optimize the estimation procedure we ll quantify the resources which are needed to be minimized in terms of number of measurements ( not the total evolution time as in previous research available , i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "the optimization process for such algorithm is hard as in general it requires sampling the probability distribution and browsing through an enormous amount of algorithm variants .",
    "the dependence of the final estimate variance ( to be minimized ) on the algorithm is a complicated function with many local minima and unpredictable behaviour .",
    "particle swarm optimization ( pso ) approach has proved to be useful in such situations when little is known about the function and global minimum is sought @xcite .",
    "it was also recently used in quantum phase algorithm optimization @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a locally - optimal approach derived in @xcite and demonstrate the improvement which can be achieved by using particle swarm optimization technique .",
    "we consider the problem of single unknown parameter estimation of a qubit hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a @xmath2-pauli matrix .    the system is initiated in @xmath7 basis ( also referred to as `` computational basis '' ) by applying a projective measurement along @xmath2-axis .",
    "the time evolution of the state initiated as @xmath8 under the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be represented as @xmath9 the measurement in the computational basis is then performed giving either @xmath8 or @xmath10 outcome .",
    "we assume that the unknown parameter @xmath11 can be treated as a random variable uniformly distributed in @xmath12 .",
    "the upper bound is defined by nyquist - shannon theorem as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the minimal accessible time interval .",
    "using time intervals quantized as @xmath15 it is easy to see that the evolution produces the following probabilities of the measurement outcomes : @xmath16    assuming that each measurement takes the same amount of time , the problem would become to optimally select the sequence of evolution times @xmath17 .      treating the information about @xmath11 as a probability distribution we now can use bayesian updating to find the estimate . taking the flat prior",
    ", distribution after some number of steps will merely be a normalized product of probability functions ( [ prob ] ) .",
    "the variance of this distribution can thus characterize the precision in parameter estimate .",
    "the choice of discrete evolution time selection as discussed above is essential for brute force algorithm optimization . in such case",
    "we can avoid sampling the distribution by representing it as a fourier series .",
    "it can be done for any algorithm as @xmath18 are both harmonic functions .",
    "after @xmath19 measurements the distribution reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the measurement outcomes .",
    "the distribution is normalized by dividing by @xmath23 .",
    "the variance of this distribution @xmath24 can then be found as @xmath25}{c_0(q\\pi)^2}\\right ] ^2.\\ ] ]    the expected variance @xmath26 $ ] is now the function to minimize and it depends only on the selection of the set of evolution times .",
    "also it is clear that @xmath26 $ ] is constant under the permutations of elements of @xmath27 set .",
    "the straight way to optimize the algorithm is to use local optimization @xcite .",
    "this approach involves fixing first @xmath19 evolution times and optimizing the expected variance after the next measurement over the choice of @xmath28 . repeating this procedure for @xmath29",
    "we create a locally - optimal non - adaptive ( lona ) algorithm .",
    "first @xmath30 steps of lona are shown in table [ alg10 ] .",
    "the performance of lona algorithm is shown on fig .",

    "however , numerical simulations show that this approach is not globally - optimal being slightly outperformed by @xmath32 algorithm in a short range around 60th measurement .",
    "in addition , as it was mentioned before , the general algorithm optimized over @xmath33 would be very complex computationally .",
    "firstly , it will require distribution sampling , that is instead of a set of fourier coefficients ( which perfectly reconstruct the function ) , the distribution should be stored point - by - point with limited precision .",
    "secondly , the brute force browsing through evolution times at each step and performing the averaging will make it unrealistic even for few steps as the number of operations grows as a very steep exponent .",
    "globally - optimal optimization and selecting all the possible sets of @xmath34 that way becomes completely unrealistic .",

    "we are sampling the @xmath11 probability distribution using @xmath36 points which gives @xmath37 precision in @xmath26 $ ] for up to @xmath38 .",
