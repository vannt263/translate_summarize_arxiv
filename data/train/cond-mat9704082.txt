    "this effort comes from one particular experimental technique , the measurement of the penetration depth or the magnetization when magnetic field is applied .",
    "the dependence of the penetration depth on the applied field ( for small values of the field ) and on the temperature is able to provide some conclusions on the order parameter symmetry .",
    "the quantity which is most easily measured is the deviation of the penetration depth from its zero - temperture , zero - field value : @xmath4 .",
    "the indices indicate an in - plane penetration depth .",
    "the measurements that have been performed on different materials do not give a completely clear picture .",
    "measurements on @xmath5 crystals by sridhar @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite result in a quadratic field - dependent penetration depth below @xmath8 and linear dependence above @xmath8 . on the other hand @xmath9 ( bscco ) shows a quadratic behavior in a region of values of magnetic field much smaller than @xmath8 and linear dependence in the remaining region @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence shows a very interesting behavior as well .",

    "the linear field - dependence is predicted by the d - wave scenario , according to xu @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite .    at this moment",
    "the question of the microscopic mechanism is still lacking a clear consensus , though most work now concentrates on the magnetic mechanism ( antiferromagnetic fluctuations in @xmath11 planes ) as the first candidate for the d - wave component .",
    "experimental results support an order parameter of predominantly d - wave symmetry , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . however , there are possible indications of an admixture of s - wave in overdoped and electron - doped materials , as reviewed in ref .",
    "this latter possibility is consistent with the magnetic hypothesis .",
    "a signature of s - d mixing is the spontaneous appearance of orthorhombic - like anisotropies in the superconducting state . in the penetration depth",
    "this would mean @xmath12 . in a system such as ybco with an orthorhombic crystal structure ,",
    "it is necessary to somehow disentangle this spontaneous anisotropy from the crystalline anisotropy .",

    "experiments in ybco have indeed shown a large difference in the penetration depth along the a axis ( @xmath13 ) and b axis ( @xmath14 ) , which has been attributed to the orthorhombic distortion @xcite .",

    "theory is used and this mean field theory allows us to do calculations taking into consideration the possible symmetry of the order parameter and constructing the appropriate free energy functional . in this manner the specific microscopic mechanism is avoided and the thermodynamic properties can be extracted .",

    "the first point of view , or the first physical `` scenario '' is the one starting from the assumption that @xmath83 , so that the zeroth order ( in the magnetic field ) value of the magnitude of the @xmath84 is 0 . in other words ,",
    "the onset of the s - component of the order parameter is caused by the application of the magnetic field and the induced currents and can be viewed as a perturbation to a robust d - wave superconductor , or a small `` transformation '' from d to d+s , close to the boundary .",
    "there are three characteristic length scales in the problem , the two coherence lengths @xmath85 and @xmath86 that characterize the spatial change of the two distinct order parameters and the penetration depth @xmath55 which is the characteristic length of the electromagnetic changes .",
    "the second physical picture is when @xmath87 and a nonzero value of @xmath88 at zero current is considered .",
    "then the superconductivity is truly two - channel and the existence of the s - wave part has to do either with the pairing mechanism or with the departure from the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice and not with the applied magnetic field which at most modifies the form of the order parameter close to the boundary . in this picture",
    "there are four different characteristic length scales , the two coherence lengths @xmath85 , @xmath86 and the two penetration depths @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( combined to one @xmath55 ) :    @xmath91      in this case there are the following consequences : ( i ) the onset of s - wave is due to the mixed gradient term and the value of the order parameter @xmath93 .",
    "( ii ) since this mixed gradient term is responsible for the s - wave it is clear that when the y - dependence is examined alone one gets @xmath94 state , on the other hand when the x - dependence is examined one gets @xmath95 .",

    "this term finally gets proportional to @xmath98 and the sign difference cancels out .",
    "( iv ) the only way to get the anisotropy in penetration depth is to consider different values for the `` masses '' in different directions .",
    "namely @xmath99 and @xmath100 and the same for @xmath101 possibly .",
    "( v ) due to the above observations the quantity @xmath78 is temperature- @xmath102 .",
    "the two coherence lengths are given by the equations :    @xmath103    from these expressions it can be seen that if @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) then the actual second order phase transition is at @xmath107 . at @xmath82",

    "the main result is that now the penetration depth acquires an anisotropy due to the nonzero value of @xmath111 .",
    "the important difference from the case with nonzero @xmath111 is the different temperature dependence which actually can distinguish between the two cases .",
    "the distortion of the order parameter is given by :    @xmath112    the coefficients have been calculated in the appendix and they depend on the g.l . coefficients ( terms beyond the first order in @xmath97 have been neglected ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] the temperature dependence of the ratio of relative corrections due to the field @xmath115 is plotted , in the limit of strong type - ii superconductivity ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "this quantity is plotted in order to avoid the explicit field - dependence .",
    "the relative corrections are larger in the temperature regime where the anisotropy of the penetration depth at zero field is larger .",
    "the effect of a small term which measures the orthorhombicity would be to get smooth curves in the region close to @xmath64 .",
    "again we see that the appearance of the s - wave admixture gives a strong signature in the penetration depth , this time in the nonlinear signal .",
    "the simple picture that this paper offers may be able to give a qualitative point of view of the several features that are observed simultaneously in penetration depth experiments .",
    "the basic conclusions are : +",
    "( i ) the anisotropy in the penetration depth may arise either as a consequence of directional - dependent `` masses '' or as a consequence of the s and d - wave mixing .",
    "as the figures show , mixing may result in strong temperature and field dependence , so the cases can be distinguished . in ref .",
    "@xcite , considerable anisotropy was observed : @xmath117 , but the temperature dependence was not measured .",
    "if the anisotropy is temperature dependent then the scenario with the non - zero @xmath88 has to be investigated more carefully .",
    "it is ineresting that @xmath118 appeared to be strongly sample - dependent in these experiments .",
    "while s - d mixing is expected to be a strong function of doping , the effective mass ratio is not .",
    "+ ( ii ) the field - dependence of the penetration depth is of order @xmath0 for both cases at least in the geometry that it is described .",
    "this is in fact a consequence of the boundary conditions in the studied geometry .",
    "+ ( iii ) the temperature dependence of the anisotropy can be derived explicitly and compared to experiments .",
    "of course the g.l .",
    "equations are not valid at low temperatures , therefore nothing can be said for the experimentally observed crossover from t to @xmath10 dependence of the quantity @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "+ ( iv ) enhancement of the coupling and the transport along the c - axis if the applied field is @xmath120 the @xmath121 plane .",
    "then it s unavoidable to get screening currents along the c - axis and actually the penetration depth has slightly different values from the ones observed when @xmath122 . + ( v ) finally the question of d+s versus d - s states arises ( and consequently the equivalence of the two directions @xmath71 and @xmath31 . in the model that is described through the g.l .",
    "equations for a tetragonal crystal structure a spontaneous symmetry breaking is assumed that distinguishes between the two states and directions .",
    "the system chooses one of the two equivalent states .",
    "measurements of the effects described here become much more complicated if domains of d+s and d - s form . in ybco experiments",
    ", this requires detwinned crystals .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the nonlinear meissner effect was examined in the framework of a microscopic model . the central mechanism that produces the nonlinearity is the different contributions to the current from the `` co - moving '' ( condensate velocity parallel to fermi velocity ) and `` counter - moving '' ( condensate velocity antiparallel to fermi velocity ) excitations close to fermi energy .",
    "then in the case of pure d - wave the correction is linear in the field .",
    "but even at very low temperatures this model predicts a transition to a regime where the corrections are of the order @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to that a very small admixture of another component is able to change the behavior of the penetration depth at very low temperatures as a function of temperature .",

    "it is found that in the meissner state this phase coherence is destroyed by phase fluctuations below two dimensions .",
    "also only in strongly type ii superconductors , the fluctuations of the field can be considered unimportant . in ref .",
    "@xcite the critical fluctuations in the penetration depth as the transition is approached from below is studied and it is found that both the penetration depth and the coherence length diverge with the same exponent which has value ( 0.53 ) very close to the mean - field one in three dimensions which was obtained in experimental work of ref .",
    "@xcite in contrast with the value of @xmath123 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on @xmath124 pure bicrystals .",
    "these issues suggest first that the calculations presented here are valid in a region not very close to @xmath64 since in any case the small parameter of the problem is in fact the applied field in comparison to thermodynamic field which in turn is temperature dependent .",
    "second the fluctuations in the case of two order parameters will have to be included in a subsequent paper because of the sensitivity of the second order parameter which is itself a `` secondary '' effect .",
    "in summary we have presented the mean - field analysis in the meissner state of a superconductor in the case of one and two - component order parameter which is relevant for the high-@xmath64 materials . in the latter case the picture of the onset of the second component due to different reasons have been presented and several predictions and qualitative explanations have been made .",

    "linear dependence on the field can be obtained .",
    "but this is not the case here .",
    "finally , by gathering terms with the same power in the applied field , the equations for @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath88 , @xmath136 are : @xmath137    the possible solutions of the eq .",

    "( [ twelve ] , [ thirteen ] ) the zeroth order value of the two order parameters can be easily obtained .",
