    "in a few months the lhc will start operating and provide physicists with a tremendous amount of new experimental information on the fundamental particles and their interactions . in this context , much is expected from the lhc to elucidate the still ill - understood quarkonium production mechanism ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this is of particular importance in view of the possible suppression of quarkonium production after quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one of the questions which remains to be answered is in particular the relevance of color - octet transitions in different production regimes or equivalently of the @xmath0 corrections in non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the large amount of quarkonia that will be produced in the pp , pa and aa modes at the lhc will allow for even more precise analyses than those performed recently at run ii of the tevatron @xcite .",
    "we expect cross section and polarization measurements of inclusive , prompt and ( hopefully ) direct yields of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "in addition , analyses of their associated production with a heavy - quark pair @xcite or of other channels would certainly be as interesting and in some cases better suited to disentangle the color - singlet and color - octet transitions and to assess the importance of @xmath6-channel cuts @xcite and of the rescattering with comovers @xcite .",
    "recently , several quarkonium production cross sections have been evaluated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of perturbative qcd @xcite , complementing the pioneering work for color - singlet production in direct @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these calculations is the significant size of the nlo corrections , in particular for large transverse momenta of the quarkonia .",
    "the color - singlet prediction can thus be brought considerably closer to the data .",
    "as of today , only the color - octet contributions to direct @xmath8 collisions have been evaluated at nlo @xcite .",
    "very little is known yet about nlo effects on the polarization of the produced quarkonia .",
    "however , the leading order ( lo ) nrqcd prediction including sizable color - octet contributions is known to be in conflict with the measurements e.g.in hadroproduction @xcite . a recent nlo evaluation for @xmath1 mesons produced directly as color - singlet states in gluon - gluon fusion changes the lo prediction from almost purely transverse to rather longitudinal polarization at nlo @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding unpolarized differential cross section still falls short of the data , preventing any conclusive interpretation of this result @xcite .",
    "a forthcoming study of both the differential cross section and the polarization at nlo complemented by dominant nnlo corrections might help to elucidate the situation further , at least for hadroproduction @xcite .    in the absence of an international linear collider ( ilc ) , the lhc will , at least in the short term , present an almost unique environment for high - energy photon - photon collisions @xcite .",
    "these tend to produce much cleaner events than those produced in inelastic hadron collisions .",
    "they may also help to validate the only experimental analysis of quarkonium production in photon - photon collisions to date @xcite , which clearly required important color - octet contributions @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus here on quarkonium production in photon - photon collisions at the lhc .",
    "first , we recall the theoretical status along with more specific results related to the lep ii analysis . we then present original results for ultra - peripheral @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 collisions obtained with the tree - level quarkonium amplitude generator madonia @xcite , before we present our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "photons can interact either directly with the quarks participating in the hard - scattering process ( direct photoproduction ) or via their quark and gluon content ( resolved photoproduction ) .",
    "thus , inclusive quarkonium production in photon - photon collisions receives contributions from the direct , single - resolved , and double - resolved channels .",
    "all three contributions are formally of the same order in the perturbative expansion and must be included .",
    "the @xmath1 mesons can be produced directly , or via radiative or hadronic decays of heavier charmonia , such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons , or via weak decays of @xmath14 hadrons , where the latter can often be safely neglected .",
    "the cross sections of the four residual indirect production channels may be approximated by multiplying the direct - production cross sections of the respective intermediate charmonia with their decay branching fractions to @xmath1 mesons .    invoking the equivalent photon approximation and the factorization theorems of the qcd parton model and nrqcd ,",
    "the differential cross section can be written as @xmath15\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } \\times d\\sigma(ab\\to c\\overline{c}[n]+d ) , \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the equivalent number of transverse photons radiated by the initial - state particles @xmath17 and @xmath14 , @xmath18 are the parton densities of the photon , @xmath19\\rangle$ ] are the operator matrix elements of the @xmath20 meson , @xmath21+d)$ ] are the differential partonic cross sections , the integrals are over the longitudinal - momentum fractions of the emitted particles w.r.t .  the emitting ones , and it is summed over @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 . to leading order in @xmath25 , we need to include the @xmath26 fock states @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . with the definition @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) accommodates the direct , single - resolved , and double - resolved channels .",
    "the presence of parton @xmath33 is to ensure that @xmath34 can take finite values .    in fig .",

    "@xmath37 measured by delphi @xcite is compared with lo nrqcd and color - singlet predictions @xcite .",
    "the solid lines and shaded bands represent the central results with mrst98lo parton densities and their uncertainties , respectively , while the dashed lines represent the results obtained with cteq5l parton densities .",
    "it is clear that at lo the delphi data favor the nrqcd prediction , while they significantly overshoot the csm one .",
    "note , however , that the associated production of @xmath1 mesons with additional @xmath38 pairs can be numerically important @xcite .    at nlo",
    ", the inclusive production of @xmath1 mesons with finite values of @xmath34 has so far only been studied in the color - singlet channel in direct photon - proton @xcite and proton - proton @xcite collisions and in the color - octet channel only in direct photon - photon collisions @xcite .",
    "the technical difficulties that need to be tackled in these calculations include the treatment of uv , collinear , soft , and coulomb singularities , the nrqcd operator renormalization , the mass factorization , and the analytic evaluation of five - point one - loop integrals with uv , soft , and coulomb singularities . as for the real corrections ,",
    "the phase - space slicing method can be employed to demarcate the regions of phase space containing soft and collinear singularities from the hard regions , where the phase - space integrations can be carried out numerically .",
    "one must , of course , verify that the combined result is , to very good approximation , independent of the choices of the cut - off parameters over an extended range of values .",
    "one usually works in dimensional regularization in connection with the @xmath39 renormalization and factorization schemes , so that the nlo result depends on the qcd and nrqcd renormalization scales @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , and on the factorization scale @xmath42 connected with the collinear splitting of the incoming photons into massless @xmath43 pairs .",
    "while the @xmath40 and @xmath41 dependences are formally canceled up to terms beyond nlo within direct photoproduction , the @xmath42 dependence is only compensated by the lo cross section of single - resolved photoproduction . by the same token , the strong @xmath42 dependence of the latter is considerably reduced .",
    "this is of crucial phenomenological importance , as may be appreciated by observing that , at lo , the overwhelming bulk of the cross section of prompt @xmath1 production in two - photon collisions is due to single - resolved photoproduction .",
    "the naive @xmath44 factor of direct photoproduction , defined as the nlo to lo ratio , turns out to be very substantial at large values of @xmath34 because fragmentation - prone channels start to open up at nlo .",
    "in fact , at @xmath45 , the @xmath34 distribution of direct photoproduction at nlo is rather similar to the lo result of single - resolved photoproduction both in shape and normalization .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of quarkonium production through photon - photon collisions in ultra - peripheral collisions of protons and heavy ions at the lhc .",
    "we focus on the production of quarkonia with direct photons , as only these processes have so far been implemented in the tree - level quarkonium amplitude generator madonia @xcite .",
    "this monte carlo generator uses a simple method to automatically evaluate arbitrary tree - level amplitudes involving the production or decay of a heavy quark pair @xmath46 in a generic @xmath47}$ ] state , i.e.  the short distance coefficients appearing in the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "the approach is based on extracting the relevant contributions from the open heavy quark - antiquark amplitudes through an expansion with respect to the quark - antiquark relative momentum and the application of suitable color and spin projectors .",
    "several checks are performed to validate the calculation , including those of gauge invariance and numerical cancellation of contributions bound to vanish due to symmetry conditions . as a typical set for our numerical input , we use a @xmath1-meson mass of @xmath48 gev , electromagnetic and strong coupling constants of @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and color - singlet and color - octet operator expectation values of @xmath52}\\right ) \\rangle = 1.16 $ ] gev@xmath53 and @xmath54}\\right )",

    "all cross sections have been multiplied by the branching ratio of 5.88  % for @xmath79 .",
    "as one can see , the cross sections for pbpb collisions are more than three orders of magnitude larger than the ones for ppb , and six orders of magnitude larger than those for pp . indeed , the two - photon spectra for heavy ions are enhanced by factors of @xmath80 for ppb and @xmath81 for pbpb up to corrections due to different minimum impact parameters for an ultra - peripheral collisions .",
    "note also that for instance the cross section for @xmath82 decreases faster as a function of @xmath34 for pbpb than for pp .",
    "this can be traced back to the harder spectrum of @xmath83 from p than for pb .    as we have seen above ,",
    "the expected luminosities for heavy - ion runs are also much smaller and scale , in fact , like @xmath80 .",
    "taking into account the run duration ( @xmath75 sec for pp and @xmath84 sec for ppb and pbpb ) , the number of events will be comparable to , if not a bit larger than in the pp runs .",
    "note that ultraperipheral collisions of lead ions can be triggered on by requiring the detection of a forward neutron emitted by a lead ion , that was excited during the collision  @xcite .    in each plot",
    ", we show three curves corresponding to the associated production of @xmath1 mesons with photons ( dotted ) and @xmath38 pairs ( full ) directly through an @xmath85-wave color - singlet state and with gluons ( dashed ) through an intermediate color - octet @xmath85-wave state . the associated production with photons and gluons receives contributions from exactly the same feynman diagrams , so that the two curves show nearly the same shape .",
    "they differ only in normalization due to different couplings ( electromagnetic vs.  strong ) and operator matrix elements ( singlet vs.  octet ) , the former difference being slightly @xmath34 dependent due to the running of @xmath86 that we took into account .",
    "the associated production of @xmath1 mesons with an additional @xmath38 pair allows , however , for different recombinations of the intermediate charm quarks , leading to a very different and visibly much flatter @xmath34-distribution than in the other two cases .",
    "in particular , this channel becomes dominant already for @xmath87 gev .",
    "as we have seen , the mechanism of inclusive production of heavy quark - antiquark bound states ( quarkonia ) is still far from being understood .",
    "leading - order calculations seem to indicate a large contribution from intermediate color - octet states in agreement with the effective field theory of nrqcd , but this leads to contradictions with the observed quarkonium polarization .",
    "next - to - leading order corrections are known to be very important , but are so far only available for a restricted number of partonic processes .",
    "proton - proton and heavy - ion collisions at the lhc will soon allow for studies of very high - energy photon collisions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the production of quarkonia in these collisions will have observable rates at least in pp , but possibly also in ppb and pbpb scattering .",
    "the associated production of @xmath1 mesons with photons , gluons and @xmath38 pairs will lead to experimentally distinguishable final states , which are sensitive to different intermediate color states .",
    "together with their discriminating transverse - momentum spectra , this will hopefully provide crucial new experimental information on this longstanding issue .",
