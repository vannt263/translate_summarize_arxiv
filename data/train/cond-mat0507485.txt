    "unfortunately , momentum conservation shows that collisions between the effective billiard and the boundaries of the domain are not specular .",

    "the opposite effects of successive 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 collisions lead to the billiard persisting close to the shaded square @xmath81 .",
    "however , once the billiard develops a nonzero velocity in the @xmath82 direction , the trajectory is unlikely to return to the initial square .",
    "subsequently , the billiard bounces back and forth primarily along the @xmath82 direction in the tetrahedron , corresponding to the quasiperiodic oscillations in the interval shown in fig .",
    "[ position ] . at still longer times , the billiard motion consists of unpredictable modulations that are superimposed on the quasiperiodic oscillations . the long - lived excursions of the piston near one end of the interval correspond to the billiard remaining close to one of the acute - angled ends of the tetrahedron in fig .",
    "[ tetrahedron ] .    another useful consequence of the billiard mapping is that we can also deduce in simple terms the probability distribution @xmath83 for finding the piston at position @xmath84 in the interval , or equivalently the probability for finding the billiard with coordinate @xmath85 .",
    "this distribution can also be found by using the microcanonical ensemble ( see e.g. , the first paper in ref .",

    "now the length of the horizontal side of the rectangle is proportional to @xmath88 , while the length of the vertical side is proportional to @xmath89 .",

    "normalization of this probability fixes the proportionality constant and we thus obtain @xmath91 for the probability that the piston is located at @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , the position distribution of the light particles is found by computing the areas of the triangles defined by the intersection of the planes @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) with the tetrahedron .",
    "this leads to @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we tested these predictions numerically and obtained excellent agreement between the above theoretical expectations and the simulation results .",
    "notice that under the assumption of the billiard visiting all points in the tetrahedron equiprobably , the probability of finding _ any _ particle at a given position on the interval is a constant ; that is , @xmath97 .     for @xmath98 , with @xmath99 and 10 on a double logarithmic scale ( lower to upper curves ) for zero initial momentum of the system .",

    "there is a violent series of `` rattling '' collisions as the piston first approaches @xmath122 and ultimately is reflected @xcite . in the limit @xmath3 ,",
