    "<S> the mechanism of bifurcation for the incoherent state near the critical point is further revealed by the amplitude expansion theory , which shows that the oscillating standing wave state could also occur in this model for certain frequency distributions . </S>",

    "<S> *    synchronization in dynamical systems of coupled oscillators is one important issue in the frontier of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems . </S>",

    "<S> theoretically , the classical kuramoto model with its generalizations turn out to be paradigms for synchronization problem , which have inspired a wealth of works because of both their simplicity for mathematical treatment and their relevance to practice @xcite .    recently , the first - order synchronization transition in networked kuramoto - like oscillators has attracted much attention . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it has been shown that the positive correlation of frequency - degree in the scale - free network , or a particular realization of frequency distribution of oscillators in an all - to - all network , or certain special couplings among oscillators , etc , would cause a discontinuous phase transition to synchronization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our recent work  @xcite analytically investigated the mechanism of the first - order phase transition on star network . </S>",
    "<S> we revealed that the structural relationship between the incoherent state and the synchronous state leads to different routes to the transition of synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been shown that the generalized kuramoto model with frequency - weighted coupling can generate first - order synchronization transition in general networks @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the critical coupling strength for both forward and backward transitions , as well as the stability of the two - cluster coherent state , have been further determined analytically for typical frequency distributions .    in this paper , we present a complete framework to investigate the synchronization in the frequency - weighted kuramoto model with all - to - all couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it includes three separate analyses from different angles , which together presents a global picture for our understanding of the synchronization in the model . </S>",
    "<S> first , a rigorous mean - field analysis is implemented where the possible steady states of the model are predicted , such as the incoherent state , the two - cluster synchronous state , and the traveling wave state . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in this model the mean - field frequency is not necessarily equal to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the non - vanishing mean - field frequency plays a crucial role in determining the critical coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> second , a detailed linear stability analysis of the incoherent state is performed . </S>",
    "<S> also , the exact expression for the critical coupling strength is obtained , which is consistent with the results of the mean - field analysis , and keeps the same form for general heterogenous couplings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been proved that the linearized operator has no discrete spectrum when the coupling strength is below a threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that in this model the incoherent state is only neutrally stable below the synchronization threshold . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , numerical simulations demonstrate that in this neutrally stable regime predicted by the linear theory , the perturbed order parameter decays to zero and its decaying envelope follows exponential form for short time . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a nonlinear center - manifold reduction to the model is conducted , which reveals the local bifurcation mechanism of the incoherent state near the critical point . as expected </S>",
    "<S> , the non - stationary standing wave state could also exist in this model with certain frequency distributions . </S>",
    "<S> extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to verify our theoretical analyses . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we report our main results , both theoretically and numerically .    * results * + * the mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> * we start by considering the frequency - weighted kuramoto model @xcite , in which the dynamics of phase oscillators are governed by the following equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the coupling strength , and @xmath2 is the natural frequency of the @xmath3th oscillator . without loss of generality , </S>",
    "<S> the natural frequencies @xmath4 satisfy certain density function @xmath5 that is assumed to be symmetric and centered at @xmath6 throughout the paper . </S>",
    "<S> the most important characteristic of this generalized kuramoto model is to introduce a frequency weight to the coupling , which leads to heterogeneous interactions in networks . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re1 ] ) exhibits a transition to synchronization as the coupling strength @xmath1 increases above a critical threshold @xmath7 . typically , the collective behavior in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re1 ] ) can be characterized by the order parameter @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the average complex amplitude of all oscillators on the unit circle . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is the magnitude of complex amplitude characterizing the level of synchronization , and @xmath11 is the phase of the mean - field corresponding to the peak of the distribution of phases . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 is small enough , @xmath12 characterizing the incoherent state in which the phases of oscillators are almost randomly distributed . as @xmath1 increases , usually a cluster of phase - locked oscillators </S>",
    "<S> appear , characterized by an order parameter @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> then the system is in the synchronous ( coherent ) state where the phase - locked oscillators coexist with the phase - drifting ones .    </S>",
    "<S> one central issue in the study of synchronization is to identify all the possible asymptotic coherent states of the system as the coupling strength @xmath1 increases . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the self - consistence method turns out to be effective . in the following , we conduct theoretical analysis to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re1 ] ) based on this method .    substituting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re2 ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re1 ] ) , we obtain the dynamical equation of the mean - field form @xmath14 we assume that the mean - field phase @xmath11 rotates uniformly with frequency @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 . without loss of generality , @xmath17 after an appropriate time shift . in the rotating frame with frequency @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the phase difference @xmath18 and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re25 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath19 in the rotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that @xmath20 when the coupling form is uniform and @xmath5 is even and unimodal . however , for more general cases , any asymmetry of the system , such as asymmetric frequency distribution , or asymmetric coupling function ( phase lag or time delay ) , or asymmetric coupling strength ( heterogeneous coupling or time varying coupling ) , etc , will cause @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no guarantee that @xmath15 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re27 ] ) is necessarily equal to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , there are several macroscopic characteristic frequencies for all oscillators , for example , the average frequency of oscillators @xmath22 , the mean - field frequency @xmath15 , and the mean - ensemble frequency ( or effective frequency ) @xmath23 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in the steady coherent states of the system , eq .  ( [ equ : re27 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> should be discussed in two situations corresponding to the phase - locked oscillators and the drifting ones , respectively . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath24 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re27 ] ) has solution of fixed point , i.e. , @xmath25 , which leads to @xmath26 corresponding to the phase - locked oscillators entrained by the mean - field . on the other hand , for those drifting oscillators , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account both the phase - locked and the drifting oscillators , the order parameter in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28 where@xmath29 is the heaviside function . in the thermodynamical limit @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> the summation over the frequency should be replaced by the integration . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution of the phase - looked oscillators to the order parameter @xmath10 reads @xmath31    in contrast to the phase - locked oscillators , the drifting oscillators could not be entrained by the mean - field . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath30 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re1 ] ) is equivalent to the following continuity equation as a consequence of the conservation of the number of oscillators , i.e. , @xmath32 here @xmath33 gives the fraction of oscillators of natural frequency @xmath34 which lie between @xmath35 and @xmath36 at time @xmath37 with the appropriate normalization condition @xmath38 and @xmath39 period in @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then the stationary distribution of the drifting oscillators in the rotating frame could be obtained explicitly as ( @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to obtain that for drifting oscillators @xmath43 and @xmath44 eq .  ( [ equ : re33 ] ) shows that the drifting oscillators have no contributions to the real part of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , their contributions to the imaginary part of @xmath10 should not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> substituting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re30])- eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re34 ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re29 ] ) , the closed form of self - consistence equations take the following form . for the real part of @xmath10 , @xmath45 and for the imaginary part of it @xmath46 eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re36 ] ) is called as the phase balance equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re35 ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re36 ] ) together provide a closed equation for the dependence of the magnitude @xmath10 and the frequency @xmath15 of the mean field on @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we notice that @xmath20 is always a trivial solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re36 ] ) , but it may not be the only solution </S>",
    "<S> . there may be more than one value for @xmath15 that satisfies the phase balance equation . </S>",
    "<S> considering @xmath47 , a pair of @xmath15 with opposite sign might emerge . </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re35 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath51 for the case of @xmath52 , to avoid divergency of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re37 ] ) , the only choice is @xmath20 , and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re35 ] ) is reduced as @xmath53 which exactly corresponds to the two - cluster synchronous state in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of @xmath54 , the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re36])- eq .  ( [ equ : re37 ] ) can be solved numerically , which corresponds to the traveling wave state . </S>",
    "<S> in such a state , the mean - field amplitude @xmath10 keeps stationary , whereas the mean - field frequency @xmath15 differs from the mean of the natural frequencies . in particular , in the limit case @xmath55 , the critical coupling @xmath7 for the onset of synchronization reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the critical mean - field frequency . </S>",
    "<S> thus , following the analysis of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re39 ] ) , we can conclude that @xmath58 means @xmath59 , which is not supported by numerical simulation . by taylor expansion of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re36 ] ) , we find that @xmath57 satisfies the following balance equation @xmath60 where the symbol @xmath61 means the principal - value integration within the real line . as an example , table </S>",
    "<S> [ table:1 ] shows the balance equation  ( [ equ : re40 ] ) , the critical mean - field frequency @xmath57 , and the critical coupling strength @xmath7 with respect to different frequency distributions . </S>",
    "<S> all these analytical results were supported by the previous numerical simulations  @xcite .    * the linear stability analysis . * </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the mean - field theory above reveals four macroscopic steady states , including the incoherent state ( @xmath62 ) , the traveling wave state ( @xmath50 , @xmath63 ) , and the two - cluster synchronous states ( @xmath20 , @xmath52 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , a thorough stability analysis to every possible solution has not been performed due to the limitation of the mean - field method . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we conduct a detailed linear stability analysis to the incoherent state because its instability usually signals the onset of synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will show that the critical coupling strength for synchronization can be alternatively obtained via the linear operator theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuum limit of the order parameter , i.e. , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re2 ] ) , is rewritten as @xmath64 and the velocity is given by @xmath65 where  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 \" denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath68 be the @xmath69th fourier coefficient of @xmath70 , then @xmath71 and @xmath72 satisfies the following differential equations @xmath73 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re5 ] ) , it is easy to verify that the order parameter @xmath67 is the integral of @xmath74 with the frequency density function @xmath5 , and the higher fourier harmonics have no contribution to the order parameter . since the incoherent state corresponds to the trivial solution @xmath75 for @xmath76 , to study its stability we can consider the evolution of a perturbation away from the incoherent state . in this spirit , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re8 ] ) can be linearized around the origin as @xmath77 and @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the operator defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a function in the weighted lebesgue space , and @xmath82 is defined as @xmath83 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re10 ] ) , it is obvious that the higher fourier harmonics are neutrally stable to perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the key is to study the spectrum of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re9 ] ) . following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , eq .  ( [ equ : re9 ] ) has continuous spectrum on the whole imaginary axis . for the discrete spectrum , we assume that the perturbation of the first fourier coefficient has the form @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> . then the self - consistent eigenvalue equation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re9 ] ) for the operator @xmath82 takes the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the complex eigenvalue of @xmath82 except for those points @xmath87 . notice that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re13 ] ) relates implicitly the coupling strength @xmath1 with the eigenvalue @xmath86 . since the real part of the eigenvalue @xmath86 determines the stability of the incoherent state , we rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re13 ] ) into two equations by letting @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re14 ] ) , we see that @xmath91 , i.e. , the real part of @xmath86 , can never be negative , otherwise @xmath92 , which makes no physical sense . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the incoherent state in model ( [ equ : re1 ] ) can not be linearly stable . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is neutrally stable due to the existence of continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis @xcite . furthermore , if the coupling strength @xmath93 but sufficiently small , we have proved that the eigenvalue @xmath86 does not exist ( the details are included in the supplementary material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis above reveals that the linearized operator @xmath82 has continuous spectrum @xmath87 lying on the whole imaginary axis ( with real part equals to @xmath6 ) for all @xmath1 , and it may also have discrete spectrum ( eigenvalues ) depending on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 is small ( @xmath94 ) the discrete spectrum is empty , but as @xmath1 increases , discrete eigenvalues emerge with real part @xmath95 for @xmath96 . imposing the critical condition @xmath97 for eq  ( [ equ : re14 ] ) , once again we obtain the critical coupling strength as @xmath98 where @xmath99 are determined by the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re15 ] ) with the limit @xmath97 . evidently , @xmath57 is the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of operator @xmath82 at the boundary of stability . </S>",
    "<S> generally eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re15 ] ) may have more than one root with @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath100 means that we choose the @xmath101th root @xmath99 which makes the product @xmath102 is maximal , so that @xmath103 corresponds to the foremost critical point for the onset of synchronization .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the above linear stability analysis , the incoherent state of model ( [ equ : re1 ] ) is only neutrally stable below the synchronization threshold . </S>",
    "<S> however , interestingly , we find that in this regime the perturbed order parameter @xmath67 actually decays to zero in the long time limit ( @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was first found in the classical kuramoto model , and was revealed to be analogous to the famous landau damping in plasma physics @xcite . to investigate the landau damping effect in our model , we rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re9 ] ) as @xmath105 which could be solved explicitly , i.e. , @xmath106 substituting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re23 ] ) into the expression of @xmath67 , we obtain the perturbed order parameter as @xmath107 here @xmath108 is a constant related to the initial value and it is convenient to set @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re24 ] ) represents a closed form for the dependence of @xmath110 on the coupling strength @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , it is difficult to get the expression of @xmath110 analytically for the present model . </S>",
    "<S> however , we still can obtain useful information via direct numerical simulations . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , the numerical solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re24 ] ) are illustrated for different values of @xmath1 and typical frequency distributions @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> generally , we observe the decay of @xmath111 , i.e , @xmath112 . depending on @xmath5 and @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the scenarios turn out to be different . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that when the coupling constant is absent , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re24 ] ) can be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for example , when @xmath113 , @xmath114 for the uniform distribution [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) ] , @xmath115 for the triangle distribution [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](d ) ] , and @xmath116 for the lorentzian distribution [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](g ) ] . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the decay phenomena strongly depend on the form of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the increasing of @xmath1 the situation changes . it is observed that the order parameter decays in a way with significant oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , its envelope follows the form of exponential decay , namely , @xmath117 for a short time , where @xmath118 is the decay exponent . while the general dynamical mechanism of this decay is still an open issue , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pointed out that this exponential decay of order parameter in the neutrally stable regime is closely related to the resonance pole on the left - half complex plane , and the decaying rate @xmath118 is the real part of it .    </S>",
    "<S> for the two - cluster synchronous states eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re38 ] ) , previous analysis has shown that @xmath119 is linearly stable , and @xmath120 is linearly unstable  @xcite . for the traveling wave state in the range ( @xmath63 ) , its stability </S>",
    "<S> can only be studied through numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted extensive simulations by choosing different initial conditions for phase oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> we even specially choose a proper initial condition to make the system artificially locate onto the traveling wave state . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in all these cases the system evolves to the two - cluster synchronous state as long as @xmath121 ( the subscript @xmath122 denotes the backward transition point ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the numerical results give evidence that the traveling wave state predicted by the mean - field theory turns out to be unstable in the current model .    * the bifurcation analysis . * </S>",
    "<S> the above stability analysis leads to the conclusion that near the finite critical coupling @xmath7 , the incoherent state becomes unstable with the emergence of a pair of complex conjugated eigenvalues @xmath123 ; meanwhile the traveling wave solution is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the absolute coupling , eq  ( [ equ : re1 ] ) always has the two - cluster synchronous solution [ eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ : re38 ] ) ] when @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> this is independent of the specific form of @xmath5 as long as @xmath5 is symmetric and centered at @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath125 , the first - order synchronization transition would take place . however , the mechanism underlying the instability of the incoherent state is still unclear , for example , the bifurcation type and the local stability of the traveling wave solution near @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these information is crucial for us to get a global picture of the synchronization transition in the dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the dynamic behavior near the critical point can be investigated through the local bifurcation theory . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to the framework of nonlinear analysis developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to reveal the local bifurcation type for the incoherent state of model ( [ equ : re1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of the theory  @xcite is that when the perturbed equation of the incoherent state satisfies @xmath126 symmetry , the center manifold reduction could be applied to obtain the amplitude equations for both steady state and limit cycle . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in order to avoid dealing with the continuous spectrum , the gaussian white noise is added and eventually the noise magnitude is extended to zero for all calculations . following this treatment , </S>",
    "<S> now the evolution of the density function @xmath127 obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the strength of noise . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , imposing the small perturbation to the incoherent state , i.e. , @xmath130 , we obtain the following perturbed equation @xmath131 here , @xmath132 is lineared equation for @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath134,\\ ] ] and @xmath135 is the nonlinear term , i.e. , @xmath136,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> then we can derive the normal form of amplitude equation for both the steady state and the hopf bifurcation in the frequency - weighted model based on the center manifold assumption . since the complete calculation is tedious , we put the details into the supplementary material for interested readers . in the following we only report the main results .    </S>",
    "<S> it is found that for the frequency - weighted model , the system undergoes hopf bifurcation near the critical coupling @xmath7 . as a result , a traveling wave solution and a standing wave solution emerge above @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard standing wave solution consists of two counter - rotating clusters of phase - locked oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> thus the order parameter @xmath67 plots a limit cycle on the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> previously , such state has been found in the classical kuramoto model with symmetric bimodal frequency distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that the mean - field theory fails to predict such state due to the fact that neither the distribution function nor @xmath111 are stationary in any rotating frame for such a state .    as an example to illustrate our results , we focus on the case of uniform distribution @xmath138 . the exact expression for critical coupling strength is @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear analysis shows that the bifurcation for the traveling wave solution is supercritical and unstable ( which is consistent with the mean - field theory ) . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , the standing wave solution is subcritical . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a hysteresis would occur by taking the high order terms of the amplitude equation into account . </S>",
    "<S> numerical evidence suggests that above @xmath7 the incoherent state loses its stability . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , non - stationary @xmath111 emerges with a hysteresis near @xmath7 [ branch 3 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ] . as the coupling strength increases , and it eventually vanishes at @xmath140 via a discontinuous transition ( with very small hysteresis loop ) to the two - cluster synchronous state . </S>",
    "<S> we have also conducted calculations for other typical frequency distributions , such as the triangle , the lorentzian , and the parabolic . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the bifurcations for the standing wave solution are all subcritical and the traveling wave solution are all unstable locally . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the direction of bifurcation for the traveling wave state supports the numerical solution of the mean - field equation . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that the stable branch of subcritical bifurcation for both states are not observed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason for this is that their basins of attraction might be so small in such a high - dimensional phase space that most of the initial conditions eventually lead to the stable two - cluster synchronous state as long as @xmath124 .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion * + to summarize , we investigated the synchronization transition in the frequency - weighted kuramoto model with all - to - all couplings . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , mean - field analysis , linear stability analysis , and bifurcation analysis have been carried out to obtain insights . together with the numerical simulations , our study presented the following main results . </S>",
    "<S> first , we predicted the possible steady states in this model , including the incoherent state , the two - cluster synchronous state , the traveling wave state , and the standing wave state . </S>",
    "<S> second , the critical coupling strength for synchronization transition has been obtained analytically . </S>",
    "<S> third , we proved that in this model the incoherent state is only neutrally stable below the synchronization threshold . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this regime , the perturbed order parameter decays exponentially to zero for short time . finally , the amplitude equations near the bifurcation point have been derived based on the center - manifold reduction , which predicted that the non - stationary standing wave state could also exist in this model . </S>",
    "<S> this work provided a complete framework to deal with the frequency - weighted kuramoto model , and the obtained results will enhance our understandings of the first - order synchronization transition in networks .    </S>",
