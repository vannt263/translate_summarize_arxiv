    "the pamela ( a payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) experiment is a satellite - borne apparatus designed to study charged particles in the cosmic radiation with a particular focus on antiparticles ( antiprotons and positrons ) .",
    "pamela is installed inside a pressurized container attached to a russian resurs dk1 earth - observation satellite that was launched into space by a soyuz - u rocket on june 15@xmath0  2006 from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan .",
    "the satellite orbit is elliptical and semi - polar , with an altitude varying between 350  km and 600  km , at an inclination of 70@xmath1 .",
    "the mission is foreseen to last for at least three years .",
    "the pamela mission is devoted to the investigation of dark matter , the baryon asymmetry in the universe , cosmic ray generation and propagation in our galaxy and the solar system , and studies of solar modulation and the interaction of cosmic rays with the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the primary scientific goal is the study of the antimatter component of the cosmic radiation ,    * in order to search for evidence of dark matter particle ( e.g. non - hadronic particles outside the standard model ) annihilations by precisely measuring the antiparticle ( antiproton and positron ) energy spectra ; * in order to search for antinuclei ( in particular , anti - helium ) ; * in order to test cosmic - ray propagation models through precise measurements of the antiparticle energy spectrum and precision studies of light nuclei and their isotopes .",
    "concomitant goals include ,    * a study of solar physics and solar modulation during the 24@xmath0 solar minimum by investigating low energy particles in the cosmic radiation ; * reconstructing the cosmic ray electron energy spectrum up to several tev thereby allowing a possible contribution from local sources to be studied .",
    "table  [ t : science ] shows the design goals for pamela performance .",
    "the various cosmic - ray components and energy ranges over which pamela will provide new results are presented .",
    ".[t : science ] design goals for pamela performance . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      pamela is built around a 0.43  t permanent magnet spectrometer equipped with 6  planes of double - sided silicon detectors allowing the sign , absolute value of charge and momentum of traversing charged particles to be determined .",
    "the acceptance of the spectrometer ( which also defines the overall acceptance of the pamela experiment ) is 21.5  @xmath2sr and the maximum detectable rigidity is @xmath31  tv .",
    "spillover effects limit the upper detectable antiparticle momentum to @xmath3190  gev / c ( @xmath3270  gev / c ) for antiprotons ( positrons ) .",
    "the spectrometer is surrounded by a plastic scintillator veto shield .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter mounted below the spectrometer measures the energy of incident electrons and allows topological discrimination between electromagnetic and hadronic showers ( or non - interacting particles ) .",
    "planes of plastic scintillator mounted above and below the spectrometer form a time - of - flight system which also provides the primary experimental trigger .",
    "the timing resolution of the time - of - flight system allows albedo particles to be identified and proton - electron separation is also possible below @xmath31  gev / c . ionising energy loss measurements in the time - of - flight scintillator planes and the silicon planes of the magnetic spectrometer allow the absolute charge of traversing particles to be determined .",
    "the volume between the upper two time - of - flight planes is bounded by an additional plastic scintillator anticoincidence system . a plastic scintillator system mounted beneath the calorimeter aids in the identification of high energy electrons and",
    "is followed by a neutron detection system for the selection of very high energy electrons ( up to 2  tev ) which shower in the calorimeter but do not necessarily pass through the spectrometer .",
    "the pamela subdetectors are read out and controlled by a data acquisition system based around actel ( 54sx series ) field programmable gate arrays ( fpga )  @xcite and analog devices ( adsp-2187l ) digital signal processors ( dsp )  @xcite .",
    "connections between different systems are realised with redundant data - strobe  @xcite low voltage differential signaling ( lvds ) links .",
    "each subdetector is also connected to a global trigger system and can issue alarm conditions ( e.g. over - temperature , data corruption ) to a housekeeping system .",
    "all the data acquisition boards ( except for the calorimeter ) are housed in a custom crate secured to the pamela superstructure , as shown in figure  [ pam ] ( bottom ) . in order to promote reliability ,",
    "common design rules have been followed for all electronics systems in pamela , e.g. over - current protection on all electronics boards , redundant data links , redundant power connections and the use of radiation qualified components .",
    "the tof system  @xcite comprises 6  layers of fast plastic scintillators ( bicron bc-404  @xcite ) arranged in three planes ( s1 , s2 and s3 ) , with alternate layers placed orthogonal to each other , as shown in figure  [ fig : tof ] .",
    "the distance between s1 and s3 is 77.3  cm .",
    "time - of - flight information for charged particles passing between planes s1 and s3 is combined with track length information derived from the magnetic spectrometer ( see section  [ sec : spectrometer ] ) to determine particle velocities and reject albedo particles .",
    "ionisation ( de / dx ) measurements in the scintillator layers allow the particle charge to be determined at least up to z@xmath48 .",
    "coincidental energy deposits in combinations of planes provide the main trigger for the experiment , as described in section  [ sec : trigger ] .",
    "the segmentation of each plane allows redundant studies of the trigger efficiency .",
    "the sensitive area of each of the two s1 layers is ( 33@xmath540.8 )  @xmath6 with the first layer divided into 8  bars and the second layer divided into 6  bars .",
    "the total sensitive area of the s2 and s3 planes is ( 15@xmath518 )  @xmath6 segmented into 2@xmath52 and 3@xmath53 orthogonal bars , respectively .",
    "the s1 and s3 layers are 7  mm thick while the s2 layers are 5  mm thick .",
    "there are 24 scintillator bars in total .",
    "both ends of each scintillator bar are glued to a plastic light guide which is mechanically coupled to a hamamatsu r5900u photomultiplier ( pmt ) by means of silicone pads of thickness 3  mm ( s1 and s2 ) and 6  mm ( s3 ) .",
    "the differences in thickness reflect the different vibrational spectra expected during launch .",
    "the scintillators and light - guides are wrapped in 2 layers of 25  @xmath7 m thick mylar foil .",
    "the s3 plane is mounted directly on the base plate of pamela , while the other two planes are enclosed in light - proof boxes suspended off the pamela structure .",
    "a high - voltage divider circuit is mounted directly behind each pmt .",
    "the high - voltage and discrimination threshold for each pmt is chosen to optimize the performance of a given tof bar .",
    "the tof electronics system converts the 48  pmt pulses into time- and charge - based measurements . in the timing section , a capacitor is linearly charged during a time interval defined by the passage of a particle through the tof system . in the charge section",
    ", a capacitor is charged with the pmt pulse charge . in both cases ,",
    "during read out the capacitor is linearly discharged into a time - to - digital converter .",
    "the tof electronics system comprises a nine board electronics system based around the pamela - standard fpgas and dsps .",
    "a separate trigger board processes signals  @xcite from the 48  pmts as well as trigger signals from the calorimeter and bottom scintillator ( see section  [ sec : trigger ] ) .",
    "rate counters , dead-/live - time counters and the logic to generate calibration pulse sequences for different subsystems are also implemented .",
    "control masks select trigger types ( see section 3.2 ) and allow noisy or dead pmt channels to be vetoed and the pmt hit pattern to be recorded for each trigger .",
    "figure  [ tof1 ] shows the velocity of particles ( in units of speed of light , @xmath8 ) measured by the tof system as a function of their rigidity for data recorded at ground .",
    "most of the events are relativistic muons .",
    "a small proton component is visible at low rigidity ( the solid line indicates the theoretical @xmath8 for protons ) .",
    "the measured time - of - flight resolution of @xmath3250  ps will allow electrons ( positrons ) to be separated from antiprotons ( protons ) up to @xmath31  gev / c .",
    "albedo particles can also be rejected with a significance of 60  standard deviations .",
    "in addition , the measurement of ionization losses in the tof scintillators will allow the determination of the absolute charge of the particles , as shown in figure [ gsi ] .",
    "these data were collected during a beam test performed at the gsi facility in darmstadt .",
    "prototype versions of the s1 , s2 and s3 tof paddles were exposed to @xmath9c beams .",
    "targets of aluminium and polyethylene were used to generate a variety of fragmentation products . during this test ,",
    "the s1 and s2 layers were used to clean the data sample , and the particle charge was subsequently measured using the s3 layer .",
    "data taken during this test also allowed the timing resolution for carbon to be determined as 70  ps .",
    "this improvement is reasonable ( compared to the 250  ps quoted above ) , since the timing resolution improves with the inverse square root of the number of photons created in the scintillator .",
    "simulations have shown that the majority ( @xmath3  75% ) of triggers in orbit are  false \" triggers  @xcite , i.e. where the coincidental energy deposits in the time of flight scintillators are generated by secondary particles produced in the mechanical structure of the experiment , as shown in figure  [ ints ] .",
    "the aim of the anticoincidence systems is to identify these events during offline data analysis , or through the use of a second - level trigger in - orbit ( see section  [ sec : trigger ] ) .",
    "the pamela experiment contains two anticoincidence ( ac ) systems  @xcite .",
    "the primary ac system  @xcite consists of 4  plastic scintillators ( cas ) surrounding the sides of the magnet and one covering the top ( cat ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : ac ] .",
    "a secondary ac system consists of 4  plastic scintillators ( card ) that surrounds the volume between the first two time - of - flight planes .",
    "the card detectors are scaled - down versions of cas .",
    "the ac systems use 8  mm thick plastic scintillators ( bicron bc-448 m  @xcite ) read out by hamamatsu  @xcite r5900u pmts .",
    "each scintillator is covered in two layers of reflective tyvek  @xcite material and coupled via a 7  mm thick silicone pad to the pmts .",
    "each cas and card detector is read out by two identical pmts in order to decrease the possibility of single point failure .",
    "also for this reason , and to cover the irregularly shaped area , the cat detector is read out by 8 pmts .",
    "a high - voltage divider is mounted directly behind each pmt and operated at a fixed voltage of -800  v. the scintillators and pmts are housed in aluminium containers which provide light - tightness , allow fixation to the pamela superstructure and ensure that a reliable scintillator - pmt coupling is maintained .",
    "the small fringe field from the magnetic spectrometer at the position of the pmts means that additional magnetic shielding is not required .",
    "the signals from the 24  pmts are divided between two independent data acquisition boards with signals from pmts for a given cas or card detector or cat quadrant routed to different boards .",
    "only binary hit information is stored from each pmt indicating whether the deposited energy exceeds 0.5  mip ( where 1  mip is the most probable energy deposited by a normally incident minimum ionising particle ) . on each board , an analogue front - end electronics system comprising an integration / amplification and discrimination stage processes the pmt signals before they are fed into a fpga .",
    "the core of this digital system is a 16  bit shift register allowing hit information to be recorded in a time window of length 1.28  @xmath7s centered on the trigger time . within this window",
    "the hit can be located with an accuracy of 80  ns .",
    "the fpga also allows the pmt singles rates to be monitored and controls the data acquisition system .",
    "a dsp controls a monitoring system which is based around 640  nm miniature leds glued directly to the scintillator material .",
    "the efficiency of the large area cas detectors has been studied using an external drift chamber to map the spatial distribution of incident cosmic ray muons . a detection efficiency for mips of ( 99.91@xmath100.04)% was observed  @xcite .",
    "the ac system has also been tested by studying the backscattering of particles ( see figure  [ ints ] ) from the calorimeter during tests with high energy particle beams  @xcite . the robustness of the ac system has been determined by studying the stability of the scintillator - pmt coupling to variations in temperature  @xcite and the vibration spectra expected during launch  @xcite .      the central part of the pamela apparatus is a magnetic spectrometer  @xcite consisting of a permanent magnet and a silicon tracker .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer is used to determine the sign of charge and the rigidity of particles up to @xmath31  tv / c .",
    "ionisation loss measurements are also made in the silicon planes , allowing absolute particle charge to be determined up to at least z=6 .",
    "the magnet is composed of five modules forming a tower 44.5  cm high .",
    "each module comprises twelve magnetic blocks , made of a nd - fe - b alloy with a residual magnetisation of 1.3  t. the blocks are configured to provide an almost uniform magnetic field oriented along the y - direction inside a cavity of dimensions ( 13.1@xmath516.1 )  @xmath2 .",
    "the dimensions of the permanent magnet define the geometrical factor of the pamela experiment to be 21.5  @xmath2sr . to allow precise rigidity measurements to be obtained from the reconstructed particle trajectory",
    ", the magnetic field has been precisely measured with a hall probe through - out the cavity volume and the surrounding regions .",
    "figure  [ ybz0 ] shows the y - component of the magnetic field measured in the z=0 plane as a function of x and y and the y - component as measured along the z - axis .",
    "the mean magnetic field inside the cavity is 0.43  t with a value of 0.48  t measured at the centre .",
    "any stray magnetic field outside of the cavity can potentially interfere with the satellite instruments and navigation systems . in order to attenuate the stray field ,",
    "the magnet is enclosed by ferromagnetic shielding .",
    "six equidistant 300  @xmath7 m thick silicon detector planes are inserted inside the magnetic cavity .",
    "the double - sided silicon sensors provide two independent impact coordinates on each plane .",
    "the basic detecting unit is the ladder which comprises two sensors , ( 5.33@xmath57.00 )  @xmath2 , assembled with a front - end hybrid circuit , as shown in figure  [ hybrid ] .",
    "each plane is built from three ladders that are inserted inside an aluminium frame which connects to the magnet canister . in order to limit multiple scattering in dead layers ,",
    "no additional supporting structure is present above or below the planes .",
    "each high resistivity n - type silicon detector is segmented into micro - strips on both sides with p@xmath11 strips implanted on the junction side ( bending- , x - view ) and n@xmath11 strips on the ohmic side ( non - bending , y - view ) . in the x - view",
    ", the implantation pitch is 25  @xmath7 m and the read - out pitch is 50  @xmath7 m . in the y - view , the read - out pitch is 67  @xmath7 m with the strips orthogonal to those in the x - view .",
    "the mip efficiency for a single plane ( including dead regions ) exceeds 90% .",
    "the front - end electronics system is based around va1 application specific integrated circuits ( asics )  @xcite which contain 128  charge sensitive preamplifiers connected to shapers and a sample and hold circuit .",
    "the signals from the va1 chips are sent over 5  cm long kapton cables to be digitised by analog - to - digital ( adc ) boards mounted on the magnet canisters .",
    "the digitised data are transferred by serial links to dsp - based read - out boards where they are compressed using a zero order predictor ( zop ) algorithm .",
    "the compression factor is estimated at 95% .",
    "the main task of the spectrometer is to measure the rigidity , @xmath12 , of charged particles .",
    "the momentum of the particle and the sign of its electric charge can then be derived from the relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electron charge , @xmath15 the momentum , @xmath16 the speed of light and @xmath17 is the absolute charge . as discussed in section  [ tof ] ,",
    "the tof system can be used to identify physical albedo activity .",
    "instrumental albedo , e.g. due to particles backscattered from the calorimeter , can be identified a combination of the tof system , the anticoincidence systems , and the tracking capabilities of the calorimeter ( see section  [ calorimeter ] ) .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer measures the deflection of a particle , which is defined as the inverse of the rigidity .",
    "the resolution in the deflection measurement depends on the geometrical configuration of the spectrometer , on the intensity of the magnetic field and on the spatial resolution of the position measuring system - the silicon sensors in this case .",
    "this spatial resolution depends on the particle incidence angle . for normally incident tracks , tests with particle beams",
    "show a spatial resolution of ( 3.0@xmath100.1 )  @xmath7 m and ( 11.5@xmath100.6 )  @xmath7 m in the bending and non - bending views , respectively . the spatial resolution in the bending view",
    "is shown in figure  [ res ] ( left ) .",
    "figure  [ res ] ( right ) shows the resulting deflection error as a function of rigidity obtained with proton beams . from this plot a maximum detectable rigidity ( mdr ) of @xmath18  tv can be inferred .",
    "note that this exceeds the design goal presented in table  [ t : science ] . in flight , the deflection measurement of the tracking system will be cross - checked with the energy measurement of the calorimeter for high - energy electrons .",
    "protons and electrons dominate the positively and negatively charged components of the cosmic radiation , respectively .",
    "the main task of the calorimeter is to select positrons and antiprotons from like - charged backgrounds which are significantly more abundant .",
    "positrons must be identified from a background of protons that increases from about 10@xmath19 times the positron component at 1  gev / c to @xmath35@xmath510@xmath19 at 10  gev / c , and antiprotons from a background of electrons that decreases from @xmath35@xmath510@xmath19 times the antiproton component at 1  gev / c to less than 10@xmath20 times above 10  gev / c .",
    "this means that the pamela system must separate electrons from hadrons at a level of 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath22 .",
    "much of this separation must be provided by the calorimeter , i.e. electrons must be selected with an acceptable efficiency and with as small a hadron contamination as possible .",
    "the sampling electromagnetic calorimeter comprises 44 single - sided silicon sensor planes ( 380  @xmath7 m thick ) interleaved with 22  plates of tungsten absorber  @xcite .",
    "each tungsten layer has a thickness of 0.26  cm , which corresponds to 0.74  x@xmath23 ( radiation lengths ) , giving a total depth of 16.3  x@xmath23 ( @xmath30.6  nuclear interaction lengths ) .",
    "each tungsten plate is sandwiched between two printed circuit boards upon which the silicon detectors , front - end electronics and adcs are mounted .",
    "the ( 8@xmath58 )  @xmath2 silicon detectors are segmented into 32  read - out strips with a pitch of 2.4  mm .",
    "the silicon detectors are arranged in a 3@xmath53 matrix and each of the 32  strips is bonded to the corresponding strip on the other two detectors in the same row ( or column ) , thereby forming 24  cm long read - out strips .",
    "the orientation of the strips of two consecutive layers is orthogonal and therefore provides two - dimensional spatial information (  views \" ) .",
    "figure  [ calo ] shows the calorimeter prior to integration with the other pamela detectors .",
    "the calorimeter front - end electronics is based around the cr1.4p asic  @xcite which provides 16  channels containing a charge - sensitive preamplifier , a cr - rc shaper , a track - and - hold circuit and an output multiplexer .",
    "a charge - injection calibration system is also implemented .",
    "six cr1.4p chips are used per plane with the outputs multiplexed into a single 16-bit adc .",
    "data from all 44  adcs are processed by 4 dsp - based read - out boards mounted within the calorimeter housing before being sent over serial links to the main pamela data acquisition system .",
    "the read - out is divided into 4 independent sections , corresponding to the x - even , y - even , x - odd and y - odd planes .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the calorimeter , combined with the measurement of the particle energy loss in each silicon strip , allows a high identification ( or rejection ) power for electromagnetic showers .",
    "electromagnetic and hadronic showers differ in their spatial development and energy distribution in a way that can be distinguished by the calorimeter .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ topo ] which shows examples of an electromagnetic shower induced by an electron ( left ) and an interacting proton ( right ) , recorded during tests with particle beams at the cern sps facility .",
    "all incident particles have a momentum of 50  gev / c .",
    "the electron - hadron separation performance of the calorimeter has been extensively studied  @xcite and the calorimeter is found to have sufficient performance to reach the primary scientific objectives of pamela , providing a proton rejection factor of about 10@xmath21 while keeping about 90% efficiency in selecting electrons and positrons . from simulations , an electron rejection factor of about 10@xmath21 in antiproton measurements ( about 90% antiproton identification efficiency ) is demonstrated .",
    "the calorimeter will also be used to reconstruct the energy of the electromagnetic showers .",
    "this will provide a measurement of the energy of the incident electrons independent from the magnetic spectrometer , thus allowing a cross - calibration of the two energy determinations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ eres ] , the constant term for the calorimeter energy resolution has been measured as @xmath24 for electromagnetic showers generated by particles entering the calorimeter within the acceptance of the tracking system up to an energy of several hundred gev .    the calorimeter is also equipped with a self - trigger capability , as discussed in section  [ sec : trigger ] .",
    "the shower tail catcher scintillator ( s4 ) improves the pamela electron - hadron separation performance by measuring shower leakage from the calorimeter .",
    "it also provides a high - energy trigger for the neutron detector ( described in the next section ) .",
    "this scintillator is placed directly beneath the calorimeter .",
    "it consists of a single square piece of 1  cm thick scintillator of dimensions ( 48@xmath548 )  @xmath2 which is read out by six pmts , as shown in figure  [ nd_s4 ] .",
    "the neutron detector complements the electron - proton discrimination capabilities of the calorimeter .",
    "the evaporated neutron yield in a hadronic shower is 1020 times larger than expected from an electromagnetic shower .",
    "the neutron detector is sensitive to evaporated neutrons which are thermalised in the calorimeter .",
    "joint analysis of the calorimeter and neutron detector information are expected to allow allow primary electron energies to be determined up to several  tev .",
    "the neutron detector  @xcite is located below the s4 scintillator and consists of 36 proportional counters , filled with @xmath19he and surrounded by a polyethylene moderator enveloped in a thin cadmium layer to prevent thermal neutrons entering the detector from the sides and from below .",
    "the counters are stacked in two planes of 18 counters , oriented along the y - axis of the instrument .",
    "the size of the neutron detector is ( @xmath25 )  cm@xmath19 and is shown in figure  [ nd_s4 ] .",
    "a schematic overview of the pamela data acquisition ( daq ) system is shown in figure  [ daq ] . the pscu ( pamela storage and control unit ) handles all slow controls , communication with the satellite , data acquisition , storage and downlink tasks .",
    "the pscu contains 4 subsystems :    * a processor module built around a cpu based on a erc-32 architecture ( sparc v7 implementation ) running the rtems real time operating system at 24  mhz .",
    "the cpu is custom built by laben and is fully space qualified .",

    "communication with the resurs satellite is realised via a standard 1553b data - bus ; * two redundant 2  gbyte mass memory modules .",
    "the modules include latch - up detection , allowing operation to be transparently switched to the safe module when a latch - up is detected ; * a pif ( pamela interface board ) that performs three main tasks : communication with the idaq ( intermediate daq ) system through a dma ( dynamic memory access ) controller , handling the interface with the mass memory , and providing the interface with the vrl ( very high - speed radio link ) module of the satellite ; * a tmtc ( telemetry and control ) board that handles the housekeeping operations of pamela , such as alarm , temperature and voltage monitoring ( once per second ) .",
    "such monitoring is performed both directly ( adc inputs and contact closure telemetries ) and through a dedicated housekeeping board that communicates through serial data links with the subdetector read - out boards , with the idaq board and with the power supply control boards .",
    "data acquisition from the subdetectors is managed by the idaq system at a rate of 2  mbyte / s . upon receipt of a trigger",
    ", the pscu initiates the idaq procedure to read out data from the subdetectors in sequence .",
    "the resulting data are stored in the pscu mass memory .",
    "several times a day , the data are transferred to the satellite on - board memory via the 12  mbyte / s vrl bus where it is stored prior to downlinking to earth . approximately 15  gbytes are transferred to ground per day during 2 - 3 downlink sessions .",
    "the pscu automatically handles the flow of pamela physics tasks and continuously checks for proper operation of the apparatus . at boot",
    ", the pscu manages the operation of the power supply system to power up all subsystems , initializes all detectors and starts the data acquisition cycle . in parallel , once per second the pscu checks the tmtc information on voltages and alarms . in case of abnormal conditions",
    "the pscu can perform a hardware reset of the whole system or , if insufficient to solve the problem ( e.g. in case of electronics latch - up ) , powers down and then up pamela .",
    "the pscu also checks the temperature environment by reading dedicated temperature sensors distributed in various locations around the instrument .",
    "if the readings exceed predefined values ( set with dedicated commands from ground ) the pscu powers down pamela until acceptable working conditions are reached .",
    "the pscu also handles communication with the resurs satellite cpu and vrl system .",
    "data is downloaded to the vrl upon receipt of a dedicated command from the resurs cpu .",
    "the scheduling of data downloads from the pamela mass memory to the vrl hard disk system is defined from ground on a daily basis .",
    "the pscu organizes the data acquisition cycle in  runs \" .",
    "a run is defined as a continuous period of data taking in which the trigger and detector configurations are constant .",
    "these configurations are defined by the pscu according to information stored in on - board memory or received from ground .",
    "the duration of a run is determined by the pscu according to the orbital position ( e.g. inside radiation belts or south atlantic anomaly saa or outside these areas ) .",
    "the orbital position also dictates the trigger configuration , as described in the following section .",
    "the orbital position is derived from the  ascending node \" notification issued by the resurs cpu when the satellite crosses the equator from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere . from this position information ,",
    "the cpu extrapolates the entry time into high radiation environments .",
    "this can be performed in three ways , chosen from ground :    * when the counting rate of the s1 scintillator exceeds a given threshold ( changeable from ground with dedicated command ) ; * according to fixed time periods conservatively chosen and modifiable from ground ; * according to a table with crossing times in absolute moscow time 1  s. ] provided on a bi - weekly basis from ground with a dedicated command .",
    "additionally , the pscu can interrupt and close a run if anomalous conditions that require action upon the subsystems ( e.g. hardware resets , etc . )",
    "are detected .",
    "periodically the pscu calibrates the detectors , namely the anticounter system , the tracker , the calorimeter and the s4 scintillator . by default",

    "the default ones ( the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the upper and lower layers in each tof plane ) used outside and inside radiation environments are :    * outside radiation belts and saa ; * inside radiation belts and saa ;    since , according to simulation , the radiation environment will saturate the s1 counting rate but will not affect significantly the s2 and s3 scintillators since they are more shielded .",
    "these trigger configurations can be changed from ground with dedicated commands to the pscu .",
    "a total of 29  configurations have been implemented on the trigger board .",

    "the simulated energy resolution of the calorimeter in self - trigger mode is approximately constant ( @xmath312% ) up to about 800  gev , as shown in figure  [ eres ] . at higher energies the resolution decreases because of increasing longitudinal leakage and saturation of the signal from the strips ( about 1000  mip ) .",
    "the choice of energy loss and activated planes implemented in the calorimeter electronics to generate a trigger signal has been taken to have the highest proton rejection while keeping a trigger efficiency of better than 90% for electrons of energies higher than 300  gev  @xcite .",
    "combined with the neutron detector information , the apparatus will be able to cleanly identify very high - energy electrons .",
    "the neutron detector can also be triggered when an energy deposit exceeding 10  mip is detected in the s4 scintillator .",
    "the trigger rate observed during typical orbits is shown in figure  [ trig_rate ] .",
    "the maxima at @xmath32200  events per minute ( @xmath335  hz ) correspond to passages over the polar regions ( north pole , np and south pole , sp ) while the minima ( @xmath315  hz ) correspond to equatorial regions ( e ) . the contribution from the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) is clearly visible ( @xmath370  hz , maximum ) .",
    "note that data is taken in the saa using the second default trigger configuration .",
    "the missing acquisition time after the peaks of the saa corresponds to the detector calibrations upon crossing the equator ( about 1  minute in duration ) .",
    "dead and live times are monitored by two clocks that count the time during which the data acquisition system is busy or is waiting for a trigger , respectively .",
    "the dead time varies significantly over an orbit , due to the significant changes in trigger rate shown in figure  [ trig_rate ] .",
    "furthermore , if the satellite crosses the saa the dead time increases .",
    "the dead time also depends on the trigger configuration . for an orbit not crossing the saa",
    "the fractional dead time is approximately 26% , i.e. the fractional live time is about 74% . as discussed previously ,",
    "an automatic procedure changes the trigger configuration when entering radiation environments thus reducing the trigger rate and , consequently , the dead time .",
    "complete details of in - flight performance will be detailed in a future publication .",
    "large solar particle events ( spe ) can lead to a high rate of particles hitting the top scintillator ( s1 in figure  [ pam ] , top ) .",
    "although very large events such as the one observed on 24@xmath0 october 1989 could result in rates of @xmath37  mhz on s11 , most spe will occur at solar minimum ( @xmath310 spe are expected during a 3  year pamela mission ) and will be of much smaller intensity .",
    "for example , a coronal mass ejection such as that of 24@xmath0 september 1997 would result in a s1 rate of less than 100 hz , much less than that encountered in the saa ( @xmath3 1  khz ) . for large events the automatic trigger selection procedure would switch to a configuration without the s1 detector , as currently happens during passages through the saa .",
    "after this , a specific trigger configuration suited to the size and expected temporal evolution of the event can be selected from ground .",
    "if the amount of event data exceeds the storage dedicated to pamela on - board the resurs satellite or the daily downlink limit , an on - line event selection is provided by a second level trigger .",
    "the second level trigger is not normally activated and must be activated via an uplinked command from ground .",
    "information from the cas anticoincidence system is used to reject  false \" triggers ( see section 2.3 ) and information from the calorimeter is used to reduce the impact of particles backscattered from the calorimeter .",
    "the second level trigger is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the resurs dk1 satellite is manufactured by the russian space company tsskb progress to perform multi - spectral remote sensing of the earth s surface and acquire high - quality images in near real - time .",
    "data delivery to ground is realised via a high - speed radio link .",
    "the satellite is presented in figure  [ resurs - pc ] , has a mass of @xmath36.7  tonnes and a height of 7.4  m. the solar array span is @xmath314  m.    the satellite is three - axis stabilized with an axis orientation accuracy of 0.2  arcmin and an angular velocity stabilization accuracy of 0.005@xmath28/s . the orbital altitude varies between 350  km and 600  km at an inclination of 70@xmath28 .",
    "the design lifetime is three years .",
    "pamela is mounted in a dedicated pressurized container ( pc ) attached to the resurs dk1 satellite . during launch and orbital manoeuvres ,",
    "the pc is secured against the body of the satellite . during data - taking it",
    "is swung up to give pamela a clear view into space .",
    "the container is cylindrical in shape and has an inside diameter of about 105  cm , a semi - spherical bottom and a conical top .",
    "it is made of an aluminium alloy , with a thickness of 2  mm in the acceptance of pamela .",
    "figure  [ pc_test ] shows tests of the pc tilting mechanism performed in may 2002 at the tsskb progress facility in samara .",
    "the movement of the pc from the parked to the data - taking position was tested in simulated weightless conditions .",
    "the ground segment of the resurs dk1 system is located at the research center for earth operative monitoring ( nts  omz ) in moscow , russia  @xcite .",
    "this forms part of the russian space agency ( roskosmos ) ground segment designed for acquiring , recording , processing and distributing data from remote sensing systems in space .",
    "the reception antenna at nts  omz is a parabolic reflector of 7  m diameter , equipped with an azimuth - elevation rotation mechanism , and has two frequency multiplexed radio channels .",
    "the resurs dk1 radio link towards nts  omz is active 2 - 3 times a day .",
    "the average volume of data transmitted during a single downlink is currently @xmath36 gbytes , giving a total of 15  gbytes / day .",
    "data received from pamela are collected by a data - set archive server .",
    "the server calculates the downlink session quality ( the error probability per bit ) and faulty downlink sessions can be assigned for retransmission up to several days after the initial downlink .",
    "the downlinked data are transmitted to a server dedicated to data processing for instrument monitoring and control , and is also written to magnetic tape for long - term storage .",
    "all such operations are automatized to minimize the time delay between the data reception and the extraction of monitoring information .",
    "after this first level of data analysis , both raw and preliminary processed data are moved through a normal internet line to the main storage centre in eastern europe , which is located at mephi ( moscow , russia ) . from here ,",
    "grid infrastructure is used to move raw and first level processed data to the main storage and analysis centre of the pamela collaboration , located at cnaf ( bologna , italy ) , a specialized computing centre of infn . here",
    "data are accessible to all various institutions within the pamela collaboration .",
    "space - borne apparatus must maintain a high level of performance and stability throughout the mission duration in the harsh environment of space .",
    "the mechanical design must be such that the payload and satellite withstand the significant shocks and vibrations of the launch .",
    "the extremes of temperature that may be encountered in space require that the thermal and mechanical designs be such that the sensitive components maintain excellent stability over a broad range of temperatures .",
    "the radiation environment in space is a major consideration in the design of electronic circuitry .",
    "all chosen components must be tested for radiation tolerance prior to use . electromagnetic interference ( emi ) from electronic devices",
    "must be minimized by the use of different types of filters and shielded cables .    in this section",
    "the steps taken to qualify pamela for operation in space are reviewed .      in orbit",
    "all on - board electronic devices will be subject to the passage of ionizing particles , which can degrade their performance and eventually lead to their permanent damage or loss of functionality .",
    "since malfunctioning components can not be replaced once the instrument is in orbit , all critical devices must either be already space qualified , or tested for radiation tolerance before use .    for economic , performance and power consumption reasons , most of the pamela electronic components are  off - the - shelf \" commercial products .",
    "radiation tolerance tests therefore had to be carried out before their integration into electronic boards .",
    "a selection of electronic components have been tested under gamma and heavy ion beams during the construction phase of the pamela subsystems .    as an example , the dsp and fpga chips used through - out the pamela data acquisition system were extensively tested in the period 2000 - 2002 , using heavy - ion beams .",
    "the tests were performed at gsi in darmstadt ( germany ) , and jinr in dubna ( russia ) . at gsi",
    "the devices were exposed to beams of @xmath29xe and @xmath30u , in the energy range 100 - 800  mev / n .",
    "different incidence angles allowed different doses to be achieved . at",

    "test results have been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it is not expected that solar particle events pose a hazard to pamela . however , in case of very large events pamela will be switched off in the time occurring between observation of the flare at the sun and the particles reaching earth .",
    "the mechanical and thermal space qualification tests of the pamela instrument were performed in the years 2002 - 2003 . in order to perform such tests , a mock - up of the entire instrument , mass - dimensional and thermal model ( mdtm ) ,",
    "was manufactured .",
    "the mdtm reproduces the geometrical characteristics of pamela ( e.g. dimensions , total mass , center of gravity , inertial moments ) and the basic thermal behaviour .",
    "all particle detectors in the mdtm were simulated by dummy aluminium boxes .",
    "the electronics systems were non - functional and only reproduced the power consumption of each subsystem .    in order to ensure that no damage occur to pamela or the spacecraft during any of the different operational phases of the mission ( transport , launch , orbital operations , unlocking of the pressurized container , flight )",
    ", the mdtm was exposed to vibration spectra at mechanical loads exceeding those expected during the mission .",
    "the mdtm vibration tests were performed at iabg laboratories ( munich , germany ) in august 2002 , as shown in figure  [ iabg ] .    during the test",
    "it was verified that structural integrity was maintained and that there was no change in the dynamic behaviour of mdtm ( using resonance searches ) .",
    "the mdtm structure was subjected to the required vibration loads along three orthogonal axes .",
    "additional transport , vibration and shock tests of the mdtm whilst integrated into the pressurized container were performed at the tsskb - progress testing center in may  2003 .",
    "additional information about pamela mechanical space qualification can be found in @xcite .",
    "the pamela thermal cooling system consists of a 8.6  m long pipe that joins 4  radiators and 8  flanges connected throughout the pamela detector system .",
    "the task of this system is to dissipate the heat produced by the pamela subsystems and transfer it into the spacecraft , where a custom designed thermal control system is located .",
    "this transfer is performed by means of a heat - transfer fluid pumped by resurs satellite through the pamela pipelines .",
    "the total heat release of pamela can not exceed 360  w.    thermal and vacuum tests of the pamela mdtm were performed in the laboratories of tsskb - progress in april  2003 .",
    "six thermal modes of operation were implemented , where the three relevant parameters which regulate the instrument thermal behaviour ( pamela power consumption , external heat flows and heat - transfer fluid temperature and flow rate ) were varied between the design extrema to simulate in - flight operations .",
    "each mode persisted until a steady state condition was reached .",
    "as an example , a test simulating an interruption in the flow of the heat - transfer fluid due to a malfunction was interrupted after 3  hours when the pamela mdtm reached a temperature of @xmath360@xmath28c .",
    "the qualification test of the pamela thermal system showed that all parameters of the system stayed within the design limits ( 5@xmath28c - 40@xmath28c ) .",
    "the test shows that during the resurs dk1 orbit the expected operating temperature range of pamela will vary between 7@xmath28c for the coldest systems and 38@xmath28c for the warmest ones , as shown in figure  [ dallas ] .",

    "the technological model was shipped to tsskb - progress in april  2004 ( see figure  [ techno ] ) .",
    "the task of the technological model was to thoroughly test the electrical interface to the resurs dk1 satellite .",
    "in addition , it was used to check that the residual magnetic field from the pamela spectrometer did not interfere with the resurs instrumentation .",
    "these complex tests proceeded in phases .",
    "a first test was performed in rome in december  2003 , with the satellite emulated by a ground support equipment ( egse ) system .",
    "a second test started in may  2004 at tsskb - progress and verified the powering procedures .",
    "in october  2004 the pamela technological model was fully integrated into the resurs dk1 to complete all remaining tests .",
    "between july 2000 and september 2003 , the pamela subsystems were periodically exposed to particle beams at the cern ps and sps facilities .",
    "electron and proton beams were used with energies in the 10 s - 100 s gev range .",
    "results from these tests are described in section  [ sec : pamela ] .",
    "prior to delivery to russia , the pamela instrument was assembled at the infn laboratories of roma tor vergata , rome , italy .",
    "the system was tested with cosmic rays over a period of several months .",
    "figures  [ muon ] and [ prot ] show two cosmic ray events recorded in rome .",
    "the first is a 1.5  gev/@xmath16 negatively charged particle , with high probability of being a @xmath32 considering the clean non - interacting pattern in the calorimeter .",
    "the second is a 67  gev/@xmath16 particle with a hadronic interaction in the calorimeter , consistent with a proton .",
    "all pamela detectors are shown in the figures along with the signals produced by the particles in the detectors and derived information .",
    "highly detailed information is provided for each cosmic - ray event .",
    "the solid lines indicate the tracks reconstructed by the fitting procedure @xcite of the magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the figures show also the  ghost \" hits due to the common readout of the 2  silicon sensors of the same ladder in the non - bending projection .",
    "this ambiguity is solved with the help of track fitting procedure and with a consistency check with the other pamela subdetectors .",
    "pamela was successfully launched on june 15@xmath0 2006 and was first switched - on on the 20@xmath0 of june . after a brief period of commissioning",
    "pamela has been in a continuous data - taking mode since july 11@xmath0 .",
    "data downlinked to ground show that the entire instrument is working as expected .",

    "the in - orbit performance of pamela will be discussed in future publications .",
    "pamela is a multi - purpose satellite - borne apparatus designed to study charged particles in the cosmic radiation with a particular focus on antiparticles ( antiprotons and positrons ) .",
    "the energy range over which observations are made and the foreseen statistics mean that pamela stands to deliver results of great scientific relevance in several fields of cosmic ray research . to ensure reliable operation in space extensive space qualification tests of the pamela detector systems , electronics and mechanical structures were performed prior to launch .",
