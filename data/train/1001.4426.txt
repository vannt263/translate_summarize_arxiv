    "in the mice experiment , precision timing measurements are required to relate the time of the incoming beam muons to the phase of the accelerating field in each rf cavity and simultaneously for particle identification ( pid ) by a tof method .",
    "three time - of - flight detectors ( tof0 , tof1 , tof2 ) are foreseen .",
    "the last two ( tof1 and tof2 ) are at the entrance and the exit of the mice cooling channel ; the first one ( tof0 ) instead is placed about 10 m upstream of its entrance .",
    "figure [ fig - mice ] shows a layout of the full mice cooling channel with the foreseen positions of the tof detectors .",
    "the upstream tof detectors ( tof0 , tof1 ) must separate the pion contamination of the muon beam at low momenta ( below @xmath12 mev / c ) and are used for the experiment trigger .",
    "all tof detectors are used to determine the time coordinate ( @xmath13 ) in the measurement of the emittance .",
    "the tof stations share a common design based on two planes of fast one - inch scintillator counters along x / y directions ( to increase measurement redundancy ) read at both edges by r4998 hamamatsu fast photomultipliers ( pmts )   at -2250 v , risetime 0.7 ns , transit time spread ( tts ) @xmath14 ps ] . in the upstream section ,",
    "the tof0 planes cover a @xmath15 active area , while the tof1 planes cover a @xmath16 active area .",
    "the counter width is 4 cm in tof0 and 6 cm in tof1 .",
    "time calibration of individual counters has been done with impinging beam particles by using the detector x / y redundancy . in addition",
    "a fast laser calibration system is foreseen for monitoring .    to determine the timing with respect to the rf phase to a precision of @xmath17 a detector resolution @xmath18 ps",
    "is needed for tof0 , while to allow a @xmath19 rejection of pions in the incoming muon beam , a resolution better than @xmath5 ps is sufficient for the tof measurement between tof0 and tof1 .",
    "the resolution in the tof measurement between detectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 is expressed as :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the i - th ( j - th ) tof station time resolution and @xmath24 is the resolution of the calibration system . having two independent measurements from each tof stations ( due to the x / y redundancy ) @xmath25",
    "is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the intrinsic counter timing resolution .",
    "taking into account also the calibration errors , this imply a conservative requirement for single detector timing resolution @xmath28 ps and a resolution of the calibration procedure @xmath29 50 ps",
    ".      in the mice experiment the tof detectors have to work with high incoming particle rates ( up to 1.5 mhz ) , high magnetic fringe fields from the tracking solenoids with @xmath30 up to @xmath31 g ( only for tof1 and tof2 ) and a high level of rf noise from the cooling channel .    from beamline simulations and",
    "the expected beam widths at the tof0 and tof1 detectors positions ( @xmath32 cm ) rates up to about 0.5 mhz must be sustained by single pmts .    due to the low residual magnetic field produced by the last quadrupole of the beam channel in the vicinity of the tof0 detector ( @xmath33 gauss ) , conventional pmts with an elongated mu - metal shielding ( extending 30 mm beyond the photocathode surface ) may be used ( see later for details ) .",
    "the other two stations ( tof1 and tof2 ) will work instead inside the high residual magnetic field of the spectrometer solenoids , that is only partially shielded by a 100 mm iron annular plate .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : tof1 ] shows the residual longitudinal @xmath34 and orthogonal @xmath35 components of the magnetic field at the position of tof1 and tof2 detectors , as computed with a 2d tosca @xcite or comsol @xcite calculation  .",
    "because orthogonal components ( up to @xmath36 gauss ) and longitudinal components ( up to @xmath37 gauss ) of the fringe magnetic fields must be shielded , a local or a global magnetic shielding for tof1 and tof2 detectors has to be envisaged . for conventional pmts",
    "the most difficult component to be shielded is the one along the pmt s axis .",
    "orthogonal components can be more easily shielded .",
    "a global cage bolted to the annular return plate of the nearby spectrometer solenoid will be used for tof1 .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : tof1 ] with the relevant mechanical details .    as computed with a 3d tosca calculation @xcite the residual field inside the shielding cage",
    "is below a few gauss : a value well tolerable by the r4998 pmts with a 1 mm @xmath38metal shielding .",
    "the solution , albeit elegant , has the drawback of the need of a quite complicate extraction mechanism to allow access to the detector inside the inner volume of the shielding cage .",
    "the structure of tof1 , inside the shielding cage , is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : tof1 ] .",
    "tof0 has a similar crossed x / y structure .",
    "each scintillator slab , after a straight polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) lightguide , is read at the two edges by a fast r4998 pmt .",
    "scintillator counters have been assembled in - house starting from dtf ( diamond tool finished ) scintillator bars from bicron , to which pmma light - guides have been glued with bc-600 optical cement . a simple design with flat fish - tail pmma lightguides , instead of tilted ones ( to reduce the influence of magnetic field ) or winston cones , has been chosen to optimize the timing detector resolution ( favouring the collection of straight light ) and to allow an easy mechanical assembly . the chosen design of the lightguides has been checked with a dedicated simulation program @xcite .",
    "wrapping and assembly has been realized with total tolerances less than 1 mm for each individual counters of the tof0/tof1 planes .",
    "the final choice of wrapping is aluminized mylar + black pvc covering .",
    "the light - tightness of the covering material has been tested measuring the transparency of a small sample inside a spectrophotometer  .",
    "the optical contact between the end of the lightguide collar and the pmt photocathode is assured by silicone elastomers  .    for the scintillator material ,",
    "different options have been considered ( see table 1 for more details ) .",
    "the bicron bc-420 scintillator has been retained as a choice for tof0 , while bc-404 have been used for tof1 and tof2 . in spite of small additional problems for the choice of lightguide material ( high quality uvt plexiglas , instead of commercial uva plexiglas , as the scintillation emission peak is around 390 nm ) ,",
    "bc-420 was expected to give slightly better timing performances than bc-404 and was thus considered the optimal choice for tof0 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when scanning along a counter , effects of pmt non - equality and from time - walk   show up as demonstrated in figure [ fig - scan ] .",
    "if the pulse height distribution is fully described by the photoelectron statistics , it is possible to estimate the number of photoelectrons per single impinging electron ( @xmath39 ) from :    @xmath40    where the average pulse - height @xmath41 and the resolution @xmath42 are obtained from a gaussian fit .",
    "this estimation neglects electronic noise and gain fluctuations and is affected by the quality of the scintillator - pmt coupling .",
    "as explained in reference @xcite , the estimation uncertainty of formula ( [ ref : npe ] ) depends on the amplification factors of the first and second dynodes . for r4998 pmts",
    "these factors are estimated as @xmath43 and @xmath44@xcite , giving a correction factor of about @xmath45 for @xmath46 . from the available data @xmath47",
    "is estimated to be in the range of 200 - 300 p.e .",
    "for the bc420 counters under test , depending on the impact beam position .    the number of photoelectrons can be also estimated on simple grounds with the formula :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the conversion efficiency of deposited energy into scintillation photons ( usually @xmath50 ) , @xmath13 is the scintillator thickness in cm , @xmath51 is the pmts photocathode quantum efficiency and @xmath52 is the optical collection efficiency , to be estimated by simulation .",
    "the light collection in the tof counter has been simulated with the program guideit @xcite , using light sources uniformly dispersed along the median crossing plane of the counter . from the simulation the collection efficiency has been estimated to be @xmath53 and from formula [ eq : npe ] it can be estimated that @xmath54 p.e . in agreement with the previous estimation based on photo - electron statistics .",
    "to equalize the amplitude response of the tof0 and tof1 scintillation counters   the different pmt s gain and the optical coupling in the l / r side of each bar must be accounted for . neglecting this last factor ,",
    "a pre - equalization has been done by taking into account only to the pmt s gains . by using a yap : ce source from scionix ltd .",
    "counts / s , a calibration run of a few @xmath55 events was done in about 10 - 20 minutes instead of the many days needed in a cosmics testbench ] pulse height spectra were recorded both on a digital scope   and with a vme caen v792 qadc , read by a caen v2718 vme - pci interface .",

    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 values of each pmt and the functional form @xmath56 were then used in the detector equalization for amplitudes .",
    "while the `` normalization '' @xmath58 parameter varies up to a factor of ten with a mean value 8.04 ( 9.71 ) and @xmath60 of 3.15 ( 5.13 ) for tof0 ( tof1 ) , the @xmath59 parameter giving the `` slope '' of the correction has a mean value 6.46 ( 6.69 ) with @xmath60 of 0.40 ( 0.35 ) for tof0 ( tof1 )",
    ".    in the scintillation counters pre - calibration procedure , the pmt working voltages have been set , trying to select the left and right pmts of each counter with the most similar gains and the pmts for the horizontal and vertical planes of the same detector with similar gains .",
    "put outside the closed dsa area  , on a special trolley , tof0 was tested in july 2008 to assess pmts reliability in real working condition during the summer 2008 isis run and then moved to its final position inside dsa in september 2008 .",
    "tof1 has been installed instead at ral in december 2008 on the temporary trolley after tof0 and since then tested with a few dedicated runs . due to problems in the cooling of the decay solenoid , that persistently affected its performance , only some low intensity runs with positrons or pions",
    "were done to test preliminary detector performance .    for a particle crossing a scintillation counter @xmath20 ( i=1 , ... 10 ) , equipped with two photomultipliers @xmath21 ( j=1,2 ) of a plane @xmath61 ( l=1,2 ) of a tof detector , at a time @xmath62 and at a distance @xmath63 from its center , the signal arrival time at the pmt photocathode @xmath64 is given by : @xmath65 where _ l _ is the scintillator length , @xmath66 the effective light velocity in the scintillator slab and @xmath67 include all delays ( cables , pmt transit time , etc . ) .",
    "after correction for the delays @xmath67 , the quantity @xmath68 is independent of the impact point @xmath63 along the counter @xmath20 and allows measurement of the time - of - flight ( tof ) in a detector plane , while the impact position @xmath63 can be deduced from @xmath69    the calculation of the delays @xmath67 is a quite delicate task and may be done with impinging beam particles .    for the trigger tof0 detector , defining as a `` pixel '' the area given by the crossing of two orthogonal slabs @xmath70 ( in the horizontal and the vertical plane of a tof detector ) , the calibration procedure first determines the peak position of timing signals with respect to the trigger   and slab @xmath71 .",

    "one has to account also for the additional delay due to the time - of - flight between the two stations , using particles of known velocity ( such as positrons ) .",
    "the adoption of leading edge discriminators ( such as lecroy 4415 ) introduces a dependence of the discriminating threshold crossing time on the collected charge ( time - walk ) . to correct for time - walk , the dependence of the difference between the time measured by the tdc and a reference time on the maximum of the signal of the pmt , as measured by the fadc",

    "the precision in the calculation of the time - walk correction is limited by the very poor collected statistics for @xmath74 under 1000 counts and above 3000 counts ( see figure [ tw ] ) .",
    "the effect of the time - walk correction is illustrated in figure [ twresol ] for a typical counter .",
    "the calculation of the time calibration constants was done exploiting 300 mev / c pion beam data and after the time - walk correction .",
    "the collected data were just enough for calibration of only 9 central pixels in tof0 and 2 central pixels in tof1 .    the effect of the absolute time calibration and the time walk correction is illustrated in figure [ calib ] .    the resolution after the calibration can be measured by using the time difference @xmath75 between the vertical and horizontal slabs in the same tof station ( see figure [ tofresol ] ) .",

    "the first peak which is present in both distributions ( pion and positron beam ) is considered as the @xmath78 of the positrons and is used to determine the absolute value of the time in tof1 .",
    "a natural interpretation of the other two peaks is that they are due to forward flying muons from pion decay and pions themselves .",
