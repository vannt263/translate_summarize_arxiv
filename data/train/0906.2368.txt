    "in the quantum zeno effect @xcite , the transitions of a quantum system are slowed down ( or stopped ) by the fact one is observing the system .",
    "it is the quantum mechanical equivalent of saying that `` a watched pot never boils '' ( i.e. a watched system never makes transitions ) .",
    "however , there is an analogy between observing a system ( projective measurements of its state ) and environmental noise .",
    "indeed one can model a measurement device as a large object with many degrees of freedom interacting with the system .",
    "thus one can ask whether environmental - noise induces a quantum zeno effect , and ( if so ) what its nature is .",
    "in fact , there are a number of noise - induced zeno effects , i.e.  noise slows - down quantum transitions in a variety of ( qualitatively different ) ways .",
    "also , certain noise can slightly speed up transitions ( a weak anti - zeno effect ) .",
    "imagine a spin - half which is @xmath9 along the @xmath10-axis , in an @xmath11-axis magnetic - field , so its hamiltonian is @xmath12 if the spin is left to evolve , it precesses around the @xmath11-axis , so that after a time @xmath13 the spin will be @xmath14 .",
    "however what if we observe the spin s z - axis polarization at regular intervals @xmath15 much less than the time @xmath16",
    "? the observation is modelled by projecting out the spin - state along the @xmath10-axis as follows : @xmath17 a simple calculation @xcite shows that for @xmath18 , the probability to find the spin up during all observations up to a time @xmath19 is @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "thus rapid observations greatly reduce the spin s transition - rate .",
    "the anti - zeno effect is the reverse ; transitions are speeded up by the fact one is observing the system .",
    "the circumstance under which this occurs is nicely explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in 1947 lamb noted that atomic hydrogen s levels are slightly shifted with respect to the predictions of schrodinger ( or dirac ) quantum mechanics .",
    "the same year , bethe explained this shift in terms of the interaction between the electron and the photonic excitations of the vacuum .",
    "similar lamb shifts occur whenever a system is coupled to an environment , and can be thought of in terms of level - repulsion , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lamb ] .",
    "one can interprete this as a weak zeno or anti - zeno effect , in which the spin s coherent oscillations are either slightly slowed - down , or slightly speeded - up by a quantum environment .",
    "there is a very pretty model of dissipative quantum mechanics in which one averages the quantum dynamics over classical white - noise .",
    "the fact the noise is white ( meaning it contains all frequencies ) is equivalent to saying that it is @xmath21-correlated in time .",
    "this means one can time - slice on a timescale much less than that associated with the system dynamics , and then average over the noise in each slice independently .",
    "if the spin evolves under the hamiltonian @xmath22 above , and we turn on noise along the @xmath10-axis , one finds that @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath5 is the spin - polarization along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "note that there is no lamb shift here , so the noise does not modify the off - diagonal terms .",
    "one can use the level - repulsion argument to see why the lamb shift is zero . if the white - noise were generated by an environment of quantum modes , all gaps would be equally represented .",
    "thus there would be equal weight of modes pushing the system gap downwards as upwards , leaving the system s gap unchanged @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for coloured noise the lamb shift would be non - zero , and we would have @xmath24 replaced by @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : white ] ) to show that @xmath5 is given by the equation of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator ; @xmath26 .",
    "thus it has two regimes , @xmath27 t }   + a_- { { \\rm e}}^{-[\\gamma - { { \\rm i}}(b_x^2-\\gamma^2)^{1/2}]t}\\qquad \\\\ \\hbox { over - damped } ( b_x < \\gamma ) : & &   s_z(t ) =     a_+ { { \\rm e}}^{-[\\gamma + ( \\gamma^2-b_x^2)^{1/2}]t }   + a_- { { \\rm e}}^{-[\\gamma - ( \\gamma^2-b_x^2)^{1/2}]t } \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 boundary conditions . from this",
    "we see that the frequency of coherent oscillations is reduced in the under - damped regime . by increasing @xmath31 one enters the over - damped regime .",
    "as we take @xmath32 , the second term in @xmath5 decays at a rate @xmath33 ; thus strong noise stops transitions of the spin .",
    "consider the spin as initially @xmath9 along the @xmath10-axis , so @xmath34 and @xmath35 , thus for large @xmath31 we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath38 $ ] , so the transition rate is suppressed by strong noise . in reviewing ref .",
    "@xcite , michael berry @xcite pointed out that this suppression of transitions in the over - damped case was a quantum zeno effect . indeed , in the limit @xmath39",
    ", the result coincides with that of the usual ( observation - induced ) quantum zeno effect if we identify @xmath31 with @xmath40 .",
    "all the above physics ( under - damping and over - damping ) is contained in the bloch - redfield equation , which is applicable whenever the decay time , @xmath41 , is much greater than the environment memory - time ( the memory time is zero for white - noise , so bloch - redfield becomes essentially exact ) @xcite .",
    "however often one makes an additional secular or rotating wave - approximation ( e.g. as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is only justifiable in the strongly under - damped limit ( where one keeps @xmath42$]-terms but neglects @xmath43$]-terms ) . as we see above",
    ", once one is beyond this under - damped limit , level - repulsion is _ not _ the only source of shifts of the coherent oscillation frequency .",
    "the orthogonality catastrophe is a sort of extreme lamb shift , which can only occur in a system strongly coupled to it environment .",
    "it was called `` adiabatic renormalization '' by leggett _ et al _ @xcite , but anderson introduced the idea earlier in the context of a fermionic ( rather than bosonic ) environment @xcite .",
    "each mode of the environment tries to adiabatically follow the system ( spin ) , which means that all environment modes must shift each time the spin flips .",
    "then the transition rate for the spin becomes @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the state of the @xmath46th environment mode shifted one way or the other ( depending if the spin is up or down ) .",
    "the overlap @xmath47 is slightly less than one , however the product over all overlaps will be _ exponentially small _ when the number of environment modes , @xmath48 .",
    "this argument neglects non - adiabatic effects ( transitions of environment modes ) .",
    "@xcite used renormalization group ( rg ) and find that they too are exponentially small .",
    "we call this a `` super zeno effect '' since one would have to wait an exponentially long time for the system to undergo a transition",
    ". this timescale is of order @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a typical frequency of the environment ( cf . the examples above , where this timescale is of order @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) .",
    "however our recent work has called into question the so - called `` irrelevant '' operators in the rg flow .",
    "we suspected that they summed to give a contribution to the transition rate which was not exponentially small , but instead went like an inverse power of the upper cut - off on the environment spectrum , @xmath53 ( here we restrict our comments to super - ohmic baths ) .",
    "in many cases this cut - off is not so different from other energyscales in the problem , then the transition rate of the system might be dominated by a @xmath54-term , rather than the exponentially suppressed rates found from the adiabatic rg analysis . to check the contribution of these `` irrelevant '' terms , one would have to keep track of their evolution under the rg flow , and then sum them .",
    "this is difficult , so instead we have attacked the problem with a completely different technique .",
    "we take to heart the message of the orthogonality catastrophe and transforming the original hamiltonian ( spin - half coupled to many environment modes ) to a basis of shifted - environment modes .",
    "this powerful and elegant approach is standard for polarons @xcite , and was first applied to the above problem in a number of much neglected papers @xcite .",
    "these works showed that the non - interacting blip approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite is given by a simple weak - coupling analysis of the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "elsewhere , we will present a detailed review of this approach and discuss its regime of validity ( greatly over - estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; here we simply note the remarkable conclusion that the polaron transformation can map a highly non - markovian environment onto an almost markovian one . treating the transformed problem with a bloch - redfield analysis , we confirm the existence of @xmath55-terms that the rg analysis misses .",
    "they make an important contribution to observables related to the @xmath11- and @xmath56-axis spin - polarizations , as such they are absolutely crucial for analysis of phase information , such as the berry phase @xcite ( note that in earlier versions of @xcite , we used the rg method and so missed the terms that are _ not _ exponentially suppressed ) .",
    "however from our work in progress , it appears that the @xmath54-terms exactly cancel for the quantity considered by leggett _",
    "et al _ ; the @xmath10-axis spin polarization .",
    "we do not yet know if there is a physical reason behind this cancellation .",
    "we also do not know if such a cancellation will occur at higher - order in perturbation theory ( the bloch - redfield analysis involves a born approximation ) .",
    "if this cancellation occurs at all orders , then the transition rate will decay exponentially with @xmath31 for all large @xmath31 .",
    "however if not , we suspect that for extremely large @xmath31 , there will be a cross - over to something that goes like some inverse power of @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite , we show that a noise - induces orthogonality catastrophe can cause a spin to acquires a berry phase when the axis that the noise couples to is rotated around a closed loop .",
    "earlier works @xcite predicted noise - induced berry phases which come from over - damped spin - dynamics , rather than an orthogonality catastrophe . we argue that in our case ( unlike those earlier works ) , the berry phase is relatively weakly affected by decoherence and the leading non - adiabatic phase drops out .",
    "thus we reach the counter - intuitive conclusion that _ environmental noise may make it easier to accurately measure a berry phase_.    berry phases occur in many quantum systems @xcite , and have potential applications in both quantum computation @xcite and metrology @xcite .",
    "however in general , berry phases do not appear `` alone '' . if the parameters of a system s hamiltonian complete a closed loop in a time @xmath58 , then the total phase acquired by an eigenstate is @xmath59 where the dynamic phase @xmath60 , the berry phase @xmath61 , and the non - adiabatic ( na ) correction @xmath62 , with @xmath63 being a system energy scale ( such as the gap to excitations ) .",
    "the berry phase is hard to isolate ( and thus hard to use for quantum computation or metrology ) , because it is the second term in this @xmath64-expansion of @xmath65 . to suppress the non - adiabatic terms",
    ", one must make @xmath58 large .",
    "this means @xmath66 , so one must subtract off @xmath67 ( using a spin - echo trick or degenerate states @xcite ) with extreme accuracy .",
    "for example , to get @xmath68 with an error of 0.1% , one must make @xmath69 , which means that @xmath70 .",
    "then since one wants @xmath68 with an error of 0.1% , one has to subtract off @xmath67 with an accuracy of 0.0001% .",
    "in contrast , for the sistuation we consider , the total phase is ; @xmath71 since there is no dynamic phase and @xmath72 is imaginary and so no longer contributes to the phase ( in some cases it is also exponentially small ) .",
    "this can be shown by transforming to a rotating frame @xcite which follows the slowly varying noise - axis",
    ". then we arrive at a problem similar to that discussed in the previous section of the article . in this case to get the berry phase with an error of only 0.1% , one simply needs to ensure that @xmath73 , which requires that @xmath74 .",
    "this requirement is much less strict than that for the convention berry phase above .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that we are currently looking at whether such noise can also make non - abelian geometric phases ( wilczek - zee phases @xcite ) .",
    "non - abelian means `` @xmath75 then @xmath76 '' is different from `` @xmath76 then @xmath75 '' . in the above case , it appears possible that if we perform two different loops ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) with the noise , we get two different ( su(2 ) ) geometric phases depending on which loop is followed first .",
    "alternatively one can take a bloch - redfield approach , see for example eq .",
    "( 9 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( dropping the time - dependence and setting @xmath78 ) .",
    "we see immediately that @xmath79 is real for white - noise ( @xmath80constant ) , thus there is no lamb shift .",
