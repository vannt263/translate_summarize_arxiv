    "the @xmath11 resonance is a cornerstone in hadron physics , challenging the standard view of baryons made of three quarks .",
    "long ago it was already suggested that the @xmath11 could be a kind of molecular state arising from the interaction of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels  @xcite .",
    "this view has been recurrent  @xcite , but only after the advent of unitary chiral perturbation theory ( uchpt ) has it taken a more assertive tone  @xcite . in this framework , a kernel ( potential ) derived from the chiral lagrangians is the input into the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels .",
    "sometimes the interaction is strong enough to generate poles , denominated as dynamically generated states , which can be interpreted as hadronic molecules with components on the different channels ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "it came as a surprise that uchpt predicts two @xmath11 states  @xcite , studied in detail in ref .",
    "two poles appear , one around 1420  mev with a width of about 40  mev and another one around 1385  mev with a larger width of about 150  mev .",
    "these findings have been reconfirmed in more recent studies with potentials that include higher order terms of the chiral lagrangians  @xcite . from the experimental perspective , the old experiments  @xcite produced @xmath20 invariant mass distributions where a single @xmath11 peak is seen around @xmath22  mev . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this single peak results from the overlap of the two pole contributions .",
    "it has also been suggested that reactions induced by @xmath23 pairs show a peak around 1420  mev because the pole at 1420  mev couples mostly to @xmath21 , while the one at @xmath24 mev does it more strongly to @xmath20 .",
    "this would be the case of @xmath25  @xcite and @xmath26 .",
    "the latter one , measured at crystal ball  @xcite and analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , confirmed the existence of the state at @xmath27  mev .",
    "another reaction that has proved its existence is @xmath28",
    "@xcite , which was studied in ref .",
    "the issues raised in ref .",
    "@xcite were addressed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite reconfirming the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the two poles emerge in the theory even when only data on @xmath29 scattering and @xmath29 atoms  @xcite , which are above the @xmath11 pole masses , are fitted .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the best information on the @xmath11 properties should come from processes where the @xmath11 is produced close to its pole masses . in this sense , the abundant @xmath11 photoproduction data obtained by clas with the @xmath30 , @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 reactions  @xcite add much information to the earlier data of ref .",
    "@xcite , bringing new light into the subject .",
    "a fit to these data imposing unitarity in the @xmath33 channels and allowing only small variations in the kernel of the chiral lagrangians  @xcite has reconfirmed the existence of the two poles , in agreement with the uchpt predictions .",
    "the wide range of energies investigated and the simultaneous measurement of the three @xmath20 charged channels were the key to the solutions found in refs .",
    "@xcite and , more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "studies of @xmath34 performed at anke show again a superposition of the contributions from the two poles  @xcite , and can be explained with the theoretical framework of uchpt  @xcite .",
    "more recent measurements  @xcite show the @xmath11 peak at a lower energy than in the anke experiment  @xcite .",
    "some reasons for this behavior have been suggested in ref .  @xcite . if more data for this reaction on different conditions became available , a global analysis like the one of ref .",
    "@xcite for photoproduction would be advisable . in between ,",
    "@xmath11 electroproduction  @xcite data [ @xmath35 have unexpectedly revealed a two - peak structure , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "previous measurements with different reactions have only observed a single peak coming from the superposition of the two poles , with different shapes depending on the weight of either pole , as determined by the dynamics of each process .",
    "lattice qcd simulations have also brought new light into the @xmath11 properties . using three - quark interpolators , a state associated with the @xmath11",
    "is produced  @xcite .",
    "the vanishing strange quark contribution to the @xmath11 magnetic moment for light quark masses close to the physical ones has been interpreted  @xcite as an evidence of a large @xmath17 component in the wave function of the @xmath11 .",
    "further work along these lines was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite using _ synthetic _ lattice results from @xmath17 and @xmath12 interpolators .",
    "these lead to the right description of the meson - baryon amplitudes in the continuum and contain the two poles in the complex plane .",
    "until now , the weak excitation of @xmath11 has never been investigated .",
    "it is remarkable that while its production in strong and electromagnetic processes has to involve an extra strange particle ( usually a @xmath36 in the initial state or a @xmath37 in the final one ) , the direct excitation of @xmath11 induced by antineutrinos @xmath38 is allowed although cabibbo suppressed .",
    "notice that in @xmath11 photo and electroproduction there are line shape distortions due to final state interactions between the @xmath37 and the @xmath11 decay products , which are absent in the weak reaction .",
    "stimulated by the precision needs of neutrino oscillation experiments , there is a significant ongoing effort aimed at a better understanding of neutrino cross sections with nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the goal is to develop better interaction models to reduce systematic errors in the detection process , constrain irreducible backgrounds and achieve a better neutrino energy determination . in the recent past ,",
    "several experiments have produced valuable cross section measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of the available data ) .",
    "the miner@xmath19a experiment  @xcite at fnal , fully dedicated to the study of neutrino interactions with different target materials has recently completed data taking and started to produce interesting results  @xcite .",
    "in the few - gev energy region , where several of the current and future experiments operate , quasielastic scattering and single pion production have the largest cross sections but strange particle production is also relevant .",
    "the charged - current @xmath39 quasielastic hyperon ( @xmath40 ) production by antineutrinos has been investigated  @xcite and found to be a non - negligible source of pions through the @xmath41 decay  @xcite . among the inelastic processes , associated ( @xmath42 )",
    "production of @xmath43 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 baryons is the dominant one but has a high threshold .",
    "below it , single @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and single @xmath43 ( @xmath39 ) can be produced in charged current interactions induced by @xmath19 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "these processes have been recently studied using su(3 ) chiral lagrangians at leading order  @xcite .",
    "the weak hadronic currents and the corresponding cross sections at threshold are constrained by chiral symmetry with couplings extracted from pion and hyperon semileptonic decays . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the derived @xmath46 production cross section is a robust prediction at threshold , the situation could be different for @xmath43 production due to the presence of the @xmath11 resonance just below the @xmath17 threshold .",
    "another , so far unexplored , @xmath49 reaction that can occur below the associated production threshold , @xmath50 , is bound to get an important contribution from @xmath11 excitation .    here",
    "we report the first study of the antineutrino induced reactions @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xmath29 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 in coupled channels , paying special attention to the role of the @xmath11 . in sect .",

    "one of the goals of the miner@xmath19a experiment is to study weak strangeness production  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to obtain the number of events in which the @xmath11 resonance is primarily produced during the antineutrino run .",
    "let us consider the process @xmath191 .",
    "the number of events for a given invariant mas of the @xmath12 pair is @xmath192 the differential cross section is averaged over the antineutrino flux @xmath193 .",
    "the flux prediction , in units of @xmath194 , for the low - energy configuration is taken from table v of ref .",
    "the present estimate corresponds to a number of protons on target of @xmath195 in @xmath196 mode , neglecting the small @xmath197 component in the beam of muon antineutrinos .",
    "although the miner@xmath19a detector is made of different materials , here we consider only the scintillator ( ch ) . in this case the proton fraction @xmath198 .",
    "one should recall that @xmath12 pairs can also be produced on neutrons but , in this case , the pair has negative charge , not leading to @xmath11 excitation .",
    "the scintillator mass is @xmath199 , with @xmath200 and @xmath201 grams , to take into account that 45% of the @xmath196 data were taken during the construction time , using a reduced fiducial volume  @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath202 denotes the avogadro number .",
    "the event distributions for @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath178 pairs and their sum , in the region of the @xmath11 resonance , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : minerva ] . at @xmath205 , the largest invariant mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : minerva ] , corresponds to a still moderate @xmath206  mev , regardless of the antineutrino energy which can be high at miner@xmath19a ( @xmath207  gev ) . for negative values of @xmath153 ,",
    "the largest @xmath208 can be larger , and even more so @xmath209 .",
    "on the other hand , the cross section for these @xmath153 is suppressed by poorly known vector and axial form factors , which have been accounted here with the global form factor of eq .",
    "[ eq : ff ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the number of events at non - zero @xmath153 , accounted by a 10% error in @xmath156 , is represented by the band in fig .",
    "[ fig : minerva ] .",
    "events , primarily produced at the miner@xmath19a scintillator detector .",
    "the grey band corresponds to a 10% error in the form factor parameter @xmath156.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    by integrating the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : minerva ] , one finds the following numbers of events : @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 .",
    "all in all , we predict about 2000 @xmath12 pairs coming predominantly from @xmath11 decay .",
    "modern neutrino experiments , including miner@xmath19a , have detectors with nuclear targets .",
    "nuclear effects , not considered in the present study , play an important role .",
    "it has been shown that strangeness can be abundantly produced in secondary collisions  @xcite .",
    "the events predicted above correspond to @xmath11 excitation in primary @xmath213 collisions but the actual signal will be different .",
    "the invariant mass of the outgoing @xmath12 gets distorted by final state interactions with other nucleons in the nucleus   dynamically , as discussed above . ] ; the composition of the final state can change because of pion absorption and other inelastic processes like @xmath214 , @xmath215 and others . in the same way ,",
    "the @xmath11 can be produced in secondary @xmath17 scattering .",
    "this dynamics requires a more detailed investigation to find specific indications of @xmath11 production in @xmath196-nucleus collisions . yet , as it happens in photonuclear reactions in nuclei , even if secondary collisions distort the resonance signal , there is still a sizeable fraction of events not affected by them .",
    "these events mostly come from primary interactions taking place in the back of the nucleus with respect to the direction of the three - momentum transfer @xmath216 in the laboratory frame .",
    "therefore , a signal from the primary collisions can be observed in these reactions .",
    "this is the case in @xmath217  @xcite and @xmath218  @xcite photoproduction .",
    "[ seciv ]    we have studied @xmath11 production induced by antineutrinos , the first calculation of this sort . for this purpose we have combined elements of chiral perturbation theory in the presence of weak external fields with unitarization techniques in coupled channels .",
    "the @xmath11 , consisting actually of two states , is generated through the multiple scattering of meson - baryon coupled channels with a kernel provided by the chiral lagrangians .",
    "it can only be observed in the @xmath20 final state , most cleanly in the @xmath4 channel which has only @xmath164 . as in most reactions",
    ", the @xmath11 appears as a single highly asymmetric peak in the @xmath12 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the line shapes at different angles between the incoming @xmath196 and the outgoing lepton in the reaction cm frame indicate that the process at backward angles is dominated by a state with mass and width of around 1420 and 40  mev , respectively .",
    "as the angle decreases , the lighter states becomes increasingly more important .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels also contain an @xmath14 amplitude , where a possible resonance might be present according to some studies .",
    "this amplitude is responsible for large differences in the shapes of the @xmath12 invariant mass distributions below the maximum for the three charge channels .",
    "therefore , a combined study of @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 production induced by antineutrinos could provide useful information about this hypothetical @xmath14 state .",
    "we have also evaluated the integrated cross sections for @xmath191 as a function of the antineutrino energy .",
    "these are much larger than the corresponding tree level results due to the @xmath11 excitation .",
    "we should note that the tree level is relatively more important for the @xmath219 final state because the latter is above the @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", unitarization does not cause an enhancement of the cross section .",
    "one rather observes a reduction in the @xmath2 channel , which has the largest threshold .",
    "we have obtained that the number of events in which the @xmath11 is excited in primary @xmath18 collisions at the scintillator detector of the miner@xmath19a experiment , in the antineutrino run , is of the order of 2000 .",
    "it is large enough to conclude that @xmath11 production has a sizable impact in the scattering dynamics leading to antineutrino detection , and should be taken into account in future evolutions of neutrino event generators .",
    "several open questions in the physics of ( anti)neutrino interactions with matter call for new measurements of ( anti)neutrino cross sections on proton and hydrogen targets  @xcite . such experiments with antineutrinos",
    "would also provide a more complete understanding of the @xmath11 properties .",
