    "nonlinear hopping conduction in various materials and devices was extensively studied , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . despite relatively large amount of experimental and theoretical work aimed at nonlinear phenomena in static ( dc ) hopping conduction , the understanding in this research area is far from being complete .",
    "the common knowledge is that nonlinear effects in hopping conduction are determined by interplay between the so - called field effects ( field - induced deformation of percolation paths governing the conduction ) and heating of the charge carriers .",
    "the non - ohmic effects are usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron charge , @xmath2 is the electrical field strength , @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant , while @xmath5 is some characteristic length .",
    "theoretical considerations @xcite based on different models lead to apparently similar predictions : non - ohmic effects become noticeable at @xmath6 .",
    "however , predictions of both magnitude @xmath7 and its temperature dependence significantly differ .",
    "interplay between the field and the heating effects in dc non - ohmic hopping conduction is essentially dependent on the relation between the localization length @xmath8 and a typical distance between electrons  @xcite . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with large localization length",
    "the hopping regime is qualitatively different in many respects from the conventional hopping in systems with a small @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nonlinear effects in the 2d hopping transport in systems with a large @xmath8 are caused by _ electron heating _",
    "@xcite .",
    "much less attention has been paid to non - ohmic effects caused by a high - frequency ( ac ) field .",
    "most studies have been done on modifications of dc conductance under electromagnetic radiation .",
    "they revealed a rather complicated picture of nonlinear behaviors ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which requires more theoretical effort for complete understanding .",
    "high - frequency hopping conductance is conventionally analyzed within the framework of the so - called _ two - site model _ , according to which an electron hops between states with close energies localized at two different centers .",
    "these states form pair complexes , which do not overlap . therefore",
    ", they do not contribute to the dc conduction , but are important for the ac response .",
    "being very simple , the two - site model has been extensively studied , see for a review @xcite and references therein . as is well known @xcite , there are two specific contributions to the high - frequency absorption .",
    "the first contribution , the so - called resonant , is due to direct absorption of microwave quanta accompanied by interlevel transitions .",
    "the second one , the so - called relaxation , or phonon assisted , is due to phonon - assisted transitions , which lead to a lag of the levels populations with respect to the microwave - induced variation in the interlevel spacing .",
    "the relative importance of the two mechanisms depends on the frequency @xmath9 , the temperature @xmath3 , as well as on sample parameters .",
    "the most important of them is the relaxation rate @xmath10 of symmetric pairs with interlevel spacing @xmath11@xmath12 . at @xmath13",
    "the relaxation contribution to the real part of ac conductivity @xmath14 dominates . in this case the imaginary component of ac condutivity @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with logarithmic accuracy . according to the two - site model , the non - ohmic conductance",
    "_ decreases _ with the field amplitude @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study nonlinear ac conductance in the samples containing dense arrays of ge - in - si quantum dots ( qds ) using probe - free acoustic method  @xcite",
    ". we will show that ac conduction of dense qd arrays is similar to that in hopping semiconductors with large localization length .",

    "the qd array layer was located at 40 nm from the sample surface , see the sketch in the left panel of fig .",
    "qds are shaped as pyramids with a height of 10 - 15  and a square base having the side of 100 - 150  .",
    "the samples were @xmath20-doped with b , the density in the doped layer being @xmath21 @xmath18 . in these systems",
    "two lowest states in ge qds are occupied by holes , and the third level is partly occupied .",
    "the 4th state is split from the 3rd one by 18 - 23 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 4th level is expected to be empty in the temperature domain of interest .    ]",
    "we studied ac conductance of two samples , which were annealed and were close in conductance .",
    "the aim of annealing was increasing of the sample conductance ; during the annealing the dots spread and the distance between them decreases from initial @xmath1115 nm to almost overlapping .",
    "the samples studied in @xcite had larger conductance and therefore ac hopping conductance was not observed there .",
    "[ [ procedure ] ] procedure + + + + + + + + +    we used the probeless acoustic method to determine the complex ac conductance , @xmath22 , from attenuation , @xmath23 , and velocity , @xmath24 , of a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) induced on the surface of a linbo@xmath25 piezoelectric crystal by interdigital transducers , see right panel of fig .",
    "the sample is pressed to the crystal surface by a spring .",
    "a saw - induced ac electric field penetrates into the sample and interacts with charge carriers ( holes ) . as a result ,",

    "for the situation relevant to present experiment the general expression  @xcite relating @xmath23 with @xmath14 can be simplified as @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the saw wave vector , @xmath46 is the piezoelectric coupling constant in the linbo@xmath25 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are geometric factors given in @xcite , which depend on the dielectric constants of the sample ( @xmath49 ) , vacuum ( @xmath50 ) and substrate ( @xmath51 ) , as well as on the depth of the qd layer and the clearance @xmath52 between the sample and substrate .",

    "this comparison allowed determining the transformation losses in both transducers plus the losses in input and output transmission lines ( which are considered to be equal ) .",
    "the intensity was changed by synchronous changing of the calibrated attenuators installed after the generator and after the output transducer keeping the summary attenuation ( in db ) constant . knowing the transformation losses in one transducer and in the input line we find the acoustic intensity after the input transducer .",
    "similar measurements were done for @xmath63 , 143 and 253 mhz .    since for each frequency the inequality",
    "@xmath64 ( where @xmath23 is the attenuation coefficient in @xmath65 while @xmath66 mm is the sample length ) is met , one can neglect the difference between the input and output intensities while calculating the typical amplitude @xmath2 of the saw - induced electrical field .",

    "we put @xmath80 having in mind that for this size we know that finite size effects are not appreciable in dc conductance  @xcite .",
    "each of the states can be either empty or occupied ( double occupancy is not allowed ) .",
    "the simulations were performed for the filling factor of 1/2 , so that the number of electrons is half the number of sites .",
    "disorder is introduced by assigning a random energy in the range @xmath81 $ ] to each site ( in our numerics we have used @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the lattice constant ) .",

    "@xcite for simulating dc transport .",
    "the only difference is that we apply an ac electric field @xmath87 and that , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use for the transition rate of an electron from site @xmath88 to site @xmath89 the formula @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the energy of the phonon and @xmath92 is the distance between the sites .",
    "@xmath93 contains material dependent and energy dependent factors , which we approximate by their average value ; we consider it as constant and its value , of the order of @xmath94 s , is chosen as our unit of time .",

    "thus , we expect a relation of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the effective electron temperature while @xmath103 is the ohmic ac conductance . in the simulations we can check the accuracy of this relation by independent calculation of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
