    "the logistic regression model is a statistical method for analyzing the effects of independent variables on a dichotomous dependent response , that is , a response that takes values 1 ( success , normal , positive , etc . ) and 0 ( failure , abnormal , negative , etc . ) .",

    "scheff s bands can be unnecessarily wide , and hence conservative , if it is reasonable for us to constrain the predictor variables to a certain region .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done on improving the earlier work by restricting the predictor variables to some specified regions . for example , halperin @xmath19 gurain @xcite and liu @xmath19 lin @xcite constructed two - sided hyperbolic confidence bands over an ellipsoidal region .",

    "hauck @xcite extended their work to more than one predictor variable yet still with no constraints .",
    "when constraints exist on the predictor variables , piegorsch and casella @xcite developed asymptotic two - sided bands by extending the early work of casella and strawderman @xcite from the multiple linear regression model to the multiple logistic regression model .",

    "the method in the book utilized simulation - based confidence bands ( liu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) for the linear predictor @xmath13 in the multiple linear regression model , and the desired bands for the logistic model were then obtained via the logit link function .",

    "consequently , our proposed method is able to produce narrower confidence bands if the restricted region is of the form @xmath0 , but not of the form considered by piegorsch and casella . in particular",
    ", we will show that the interval restriction on the predictor variable in the simple logistic regression model belongs to the class of the region @xmath0 .",
    "as piegorsch and casella noted , however , the regions of this form can not be recovered from their regions .",
    "instead , they had to apply the embedding procedure from casella and strawderman @xcite .",
    "not only did the embedding procedure require a fair amount of computation , but it also produced wider bands .",
    "hence , in the simple logistic regression setting , our proposed method has an advantage over theirs .",

    "* chapter 8) is very broad , but relies on simulation .",
    "our method is more focused but admits tractable forms .",
    "the logistic regression model belongs to the family of the generalized linear model ( glm ) , and the methodology proposed here can also be applied to other forms of glm ( the probit model and the complementary - log - log model , for example ) , that can be transformed into the standard regression model via a link function . in each case , a set of simulations are required to confirm the validity of the method in small samples , this would drive the size of this paper to unwieldy levels .",
    "thus in the interest of brevity , we devote our attention to the logistic model to illustrate the methodology .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the results on calculating the critical value in section 2 when the predictor variables are restricted to the region  ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) .",
    "we will also discuss how to obtain conservative confidence bands when the constrained region is not of the form  ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) .",
    "two examples are given in section 3 to illustrate the proposed methodology . in section 4",
    ", a monte carlo simulation is run to investigate how well the asymptotic approximation holds for small sample sizes .",
    "theorem  1 in seppanen @xmath19 uusipaikka @xcite provided a method for constructing exact bands when the region of interest is of the form  ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) in the multiple linear regression model .",
    "we will modify their methodology and extend their work to fit the multiple logistic case .",
    "theorem  1 in this paper presents an explicit expression for calculating the critical value @xmath37 in the multiple logistic model with the same constraint region .",
    "since our methodology is based on the one proposed by seppanen @xmath19 uusipaikka , there are similarities between the theorems and the proofs given here and in their paper .",
    "the main difference originates from the definition of the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( see the proof below ) .",
    "these two vectors were jointly distributed as @xmath43 in the multiple linear regression model , while in the multiple logistic setting , their joint asymptotic distribution is @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "the random variable @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 follows a @xmath47 distribution with @xmath48 degrees of freedom , while @xmath45 , which was defined slightly differently in their paper , followed an @xmath49 distribution with @xmath48 and @xmath50 degrees of freedom .",

    "it can be seen from the table that there is clear improvement in the width of confidence bands when the independent variables are restricted to smaller regions .",
    "for example , one particular region considered is @xmath204 and @xmath205 , in which case we focus our attention on patients who are young and have high blood pressure .",
    "the resulting critical value is 2.220 , and hence a saving in bands width as great as 21@xmath206 over the unrestricted critical value given by scheff s method has been achieved .",
    "the confidence bands in equations  ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) are constructed based on the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators in the multiple logistic model assuming the sample size is large , therefore an assessment of the small sample performance is needed .",
    "we conducted monte carlo simulation studies in @xmath171 to estimate the actual coverage level of the bands when the sample size is small .",
    "the simulation study was performed for the case of one predictor variable .",
    "five different values of @xmath7 were chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed method : @xmath207',\\ , [ 0,\\ , 1.5]',\\,[2,\\ , 5]',\\,[-.2,\\ , -.3]',\\ , [ -2 , -4]'$ ] .",
    "these selected values for @xmath7 were the same values considered by kerns @xcite , and they represent five different forms of the probability response functions : slowly increasing , moderately increasing , fast increasing , slowly decreasing , and fast decreasing , respectively .    three different intervals on the independent variable were examined : narrow , wide , and extremely wide ( `` unrestricted '' ) . the endpoints for each interval were obtained by inverting equation  ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , that is , they were calculated based on the formula @xmath208-\\beta_0)/\\beta_1 $ ] . for a given @xmath7 ,",
    "values of @xmath48 were selected to produce the endpoints of these intervals . in particular , @xmath209 were used for computing the endpoints of the narrow intervals , @xmath210 were selected for the wide intervals , and @xmath211 were chosen for the very wide intervals .",
    "these were also the same intervals studied by kerns @xcite , and for completeness , they are presented here in table  [ ta:4.1 ] .",
    "[ ta:4.1 ]    once the intervals were set , equidistant values bounded in the specified ranges were generated as the values for the predictor variable @xmath87 at four different sample sizes ( @xmath212 ) . the dichotomous response variable @xmath2 was generated based on the following : first a uniform @xmath213 random variable with the specified sample size was simulated , and then @xmath2 was determined from the probability of success , @xmath214 : @xmath215 if the uniform random variable was less than @xmath216 ; @xmath217 otherwise .    for each simulated data set , the ml estimate of the parameter @xmath7 and the inverse of the fisher information matrix @xmath10 were obtained and used to form confidence bands based on the proposed method to evaluate the coverage probability .",
    "the number of iterations in each monte carlo simulation was chosen as @xmath218 , and three nominal error rates @xmath146 ( @xmath219 ) were considered in the study .",
    "the monte carlo error , @xmath220 the estimated coverage probability , was estimated and the results are presented in table  [ ta:4.2 ] .",
    "it is clear from the table that the proposed procedure is conservative for small samples , but the error approaches the nominal level as the sample size increases .",
    "generally , the error reaches the nominal level when the sample size is 100 , but in some cases it could be as small as 50 . it can be seen from the table that there is no noticeable difference in errors between three nominal error rates .",
    "it is also noted that three different intervals exhibit similar coverage results .",
