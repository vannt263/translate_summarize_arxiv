    "in many fields of physics , astrophysics and biology , one is confronted with the description of the evolution of a system of particles which self - consistently attract each other over large distances .",
    "one difficulty and richness of the problem arises from the long - range nature of the potential of interaction @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for example , in biology in relation with the process of chemotaxis @xcite . the chemotactic aggregation of bacterial populations ( like _ escherichia coli _ ) or amoebae ( like _ dictyostelium discoideum _ )",
    "is usually studied in the framework of the keller - segel model @xcite which describes the collective motion of organisms that are attracted by a chemical substance ( pheromone ) that they produce themselves .",
    "the keller - segel ( ks ) model involves a drift - diffusion equation describing the evolution of the concentration of the bacteria in the gradient of concentration of the secreted chemical . in the simplest formulation ,",
    "the concentration of the chemical is related to the concentration of bacteria by a poisson equation ( this is valid in a limit of large diffusivity of the chemical and for sufficiently large concentrations ) @xcite .",
    "these equations have been studied by applied mathematicians who obtained rigorous results for the existence and unicity of the solutions and for the conditions of blow - up , modeling chemotactic collapse , in different dimensions of space @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xmath7 , there exists a critical mass @xmath8 ( independent on the size of the domain ) above which the system collapses and forms a dirac peak .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath9 , the system spreads to infinity in an unbounded domain or tends to a stationary state in a bounded domain .",
    "gravity is another example of long - range attractive potential of interaction . in a series of papers , chavanis & sire @xcite",
    "have studied a model of self - gravitating brownian particles in various dimensions of space . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "this model is associated with the canonical ensemble in which the temperature is fixed . a lot of analytical results have been obtained and an almost complete description of the system , for all the phases of the dynamics ( pre - collapse and post - collapse ) , has been given in the overdamped limit of the model .",
    "in that limit , the evolution of the density of the self - gravitating brownian gas is governed by the smoluchowski - poisson ( sp ) system .",
    "the smoluchowski equation is a drift - diffusion equation of a fokker - planck type . for self - gravitating particles , the gravitational potential inducing the drift",
    "is produced by the density of particles through the newton - poisson equation .",
    "it turns out that the smoluchowski - poisson system is isomorphic to the simplified version of the keller - segel model of chemotaxis provided that the parameters are suitably re - interpreted , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the 2d self - gravitating brownian gas , there exists a critical temperature @xmath10 ( independent on the size of the domain ) below which the system collapses and forms a dirac peak .",
    "this is the counterpart of the critical mass of bacterial populations . for @xmath11",
    ", the system evaporates in an unbounded domain or tends to a statistical equilibrium state in a bounded domain .",

    "[ sec_ab ] , we consider the one dimensional problem and point out the connection between the smoluchowski - poisson system ( or the keller - segel model ) and the burgers equation .",
    "we use this analogy to provide the general solution of these equations in @xmath4 in bounded and unbounded domains . finally , in sec .",

    "the dynamical evolution of biological populations like bacteria , amoebae , cells ... that are attracted by a substance that they emit themselves , is often described by the keller - segel ( ks ) model @xcite . in its simplest form , it can be written as @xmath12 @xmath13 equation ( [ ks1 ] ) is a drift - diffusion equation for the cell density @xmath14 .",
    "the diffusion term takes into account the erratic motion of the cells ( like in brownian theory ) and the drift term with @xmath15 takes into account the chemotactic attraction ( one could also consider the case @xmath16 where the secreted substance is a noxious substance , like a poison , so that chemotaxis is repulsive ) .",
    "it is directed along the gradient of concentration @xmath17 of the secreted chemical . in the simplest formulation @xcite",
    ", the production of the chemical by the cells is described by a poisson equation ( [ ks2 ] ) .",
    "this is valid in a limit of high diffusivity of the chemical and for sufficiently large concentrations ( see appendix [ sec_bc ] ) .",
    "the keller - segel model ( [ ks1])-([ks2 ] ) must be supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "a first physical boundary condition is that the current @xmath18 is parallel to the boundary of the domain ( or vanishes at infinity in an unbounded domain ) so that the total mass is conserved .",
    "on the other hand , when dealing with the reduced keller - segel model ( [ ks1])-([ks2 ] ) , one usually assumes that @xmath19 is the solution of the poisson equation ( [ ks2 ] ) in an infinite domain with the usual gauge condition .",
    "this yields @xmath20 ( in @xmath21 ) or @xmath22 ( in @xmath7 ) whenever the domain containing the bacteria is finite ( box ) or infinite ( here @xmath23 denotes the surface of a unit sphere in @xmath24-dimensions ) .",
    "a physical discussion of the boundary conditions and of the limitations of the reduced keller - segel model ( [ ks1])-([ks2 ] ) is provided in appendix [ sec_bc ] .",
    "we now proceed in deriving an exact relation that is similar to the virial theorem in astrophysics ( see sec .",

    "( [ ks3 ] ) yields a residual term @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface element normal to the frontier of the confining box . by virtue of the conservation of mass ,",
    "the diffusion current in eq .",
    "( [ ks1 ] ) is always perpendicular to the surface vector and consequently the term ( [ ks7 ] ) vanishes .",

    "thus , @xmath42 on the other hand , adapting the results of the appendix of ref @xcite to the present situation , we find for @xmath21 that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the `` potential energy '' . in that case , we get @xmath45 for @xmath7 , we find instead that @xmath46 and we obtain @xmath47 at equilibrium ( @xmath48 ) , the virial theorem ( [ ks10 ] ) reduces to @xmath49 for @xmath7 , we have @xmath50 in usual situations , the term in the r.h.s . is positive ( this is at least the case for an axisymmetric distribution of particles in a disk where it is equal to @xmath51 ) . since @xmath52",
