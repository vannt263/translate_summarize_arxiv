    "in recent years the elementary electronic excitation spectra of a variety of doped semiconductor nanostructures , such as two dimensional ( 2d ) quantum wells ( qw ) heterostructures , superlattices , and more recently , one dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire ( qwr ) systems , have been studied extensively both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "rich experimental spectra of the elementary electronic excitations ( such as charge density excitations ( cde ) , spin density excitations ( sde ) , and single particle excitations ( spe ) , for both intrasubband and intersubband excitations ) in these systems are typically experimentally investigated by using the resonant raman scattering ( rrs ) technique , which is a powerful and versatile spectroscopic tool to study interacting electron systems . in the rrs experiment , external photons",
    "are absorbed at one frequency and momentum , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and emitted at another , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , creating one or more particle - hole pair ( or collective ) excitations in the conduction band .",
    "the energy and momentum difference between the incident photon and the scattered photon is stokes shift , indicating the dispersion of the relevant elementary electronic excitation created in the system .",
    "in the so - called polarized rrs geometry with the incident and scattered photons having the same polarization , the excited electrons have no spin flips during the scattering process , which therefore corresponds to the elementary charge density excitations of the system . at low temperatures ( which is of interest to us in this paper )",
    "there is no real absorption of elementary excitations by the incident photon and the anti - stokes line is not of any importance .",
    "( we use @xmath4 throughout this paper . )    in the standard theory @xcite , which ignores the role of the valence band and simplistically assumes the external photons to be interacting entirely with conduction band electrons , the polarized rrs intensity is proportional to the dynamical structure factor @xcite of the conduction band electrons and therefore has strong spectral peaks at the collective mode frequencies at the wavevectors defined by the experimental geometry .",
    "the dynamical structure factor peaks correspond to the poles of the reducible density response function , which are given by the collective cdes ( plasmons ) of the electron system in the long wavelength limit .",
    "in particular , the single particle electron - hole excitations , which are at the poles of the corresponding irreducible response function , carry no long wavelength spectral weight ( about three orders of magnitude weaker than the cde spectral weight at the typical wavevector , @xmath5 @xmath6 , accessible in rrs experiments ) in the density response function ( according to the @xmath7-sum rule @xcite ) .",
    "the spe therefore should _ not _ , as a matter of principle , show up in the polarized rrs spectra in any dimensions .",
    "the remarkable experimental fact is that there is always a relatively weak ( but quite distinct ) spe peak in the observed polarized rrs spectra in addition to the expected cde peak .",
    "this experimental presence of spe peak in rrs can not be explained by the standard theory , which , however , does give the correct mode dispersion energy for both the cde and the spe , but fails to explain why the spe spectral weight is strongly enhanced in the rrs experiments .",
    "this puzzling feature @xcite of an ubiquitous anomalous spe peak in addition to the expected cde peak ( or equivalently a two - peak structure ) occurs in one , two , and even in three dimensional doped semiconductor nanostructures @xcite .",
    "it exists in low dimensional semiconductor systems both for intrasubband and intersubband excitations .",
    "many theoretical proposals @xcite have been made to explain this two - peak rrs puzzle .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 proposals @xcite",
    "have been made in the literature that perhaps a serious breakdown of momentum or wavevector conservation ( arising , for example , from scattering by random impurities ) is responsible for somehow transferring spectral weight from large to small wavevectors , because the usual linear response theory predicts that at very large wavevectors ( an order of magnitude larger than the experimentally used rrs wavevectors ) , where the cde mode is severely landau damped , the dynamical structure factor should contain finite spe spectral weight corresponding to high energy electron - hole excitations .",
    "apart from being completely @xmath10 @xmath9 , this proposal also suffers from any lack of empirical evidence in its support  in particular , the observed anomalous spe peak in the rrs spectra does not correlate with the strength of the impurity scattering in the system .",
    "we have recently systematically analyzed  @xcite all the proposed mechanisms within the non - resonant rrs theory ( i.e. without incorporating the valence band in the theory , assuming simply the inelastic light scattering process to be entirely confined to the conduction band free carrier system ) leading to the conclusion that none of the proposed nonresonant mechanisms can explain the ubiquitous two - peak ( the lower energy spe peak and the higher energy cde peak ) structure of the observed rrs spectra .",
    "we have recently reported @xcite in a short letter a new _ resonant _ rrs theory by generalizing the nonresonant rpa theory to include the filled valence band in the semiconductor , reflecting the two - step resonant nature of the rrs process .",
    "the purpose of the current article is to provide the details of our resonant rrs theory , and more importantly , to present rrs results for 2d and 3d systems which have not been discussed earlier in the literature ( our earlier letter @xcite presented only 1d rrs results ) .",
    "the observed experimental rrs phenomenology in 1d , 2d , and 3d systems being very similar qualitatively , our generic interband - resonant rrs theory , as reported herein , provides the conceptual theoretical foundation for understanding rrs spectroscopy in doped semiconductor structures .    in this context",
    ", we emphasize that the striking similarity of the experimental rrs spectra in one , two , and three dimensional semiconductor systems suggests that the problem ( namely , the two peak nature of the rrs spectra with the conspicuous presence of the `` forbidden '' spe peak ) is not specific to 1d systems , where our earlier theory @xcite was applied .",
    "the ubiquitousness of the strong spe spectral weight in the rrs experiment ( independent of system dimensionality , dependent only on the resonant nature of the experiment ) suggests that the theoretical explanation for this puzzle must arise from some generic physics underlying rrs itself , and can not be explained by the non - generic and manifestly system - specific theories which have been made occasionally in the literature .",
    "the resonant rrs theory presented herein ( and in our short letter ) provides a _ generic _ explanation for the two - peak structure of the rrs spectra by establishing that the so - called low energy anomalous spe feature in the rrs spectrum arises entirely from the resonant two - step nature of the rrs experiment , and can not be the explained within any non - resonant theory .    in this paper",
    "we provide ( within the resonant rpa scheme ) the _ compellingly generic _ theory for rrs experiments by including the valence band electrons during the scattering processes for one , two and three dimensional semiconductor systems , following our earlier short paper @xcite on 1d systems .",
    "we find that the rrs spectral weight at spe energy is a strong function of the resonance condition  the spe spectral weight is substantially enhanced when the incident photon frequency is near the semiconductor band gap resonance energy , and decreases drastically away from the resonance .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this feature of our theory agrees with experimental observations  the anomalous spe peak exists only around resonance and its spectral strength decreases off resonance .",
    "our results show similar qualitative behavior for the rrs spectra in one , two and three dimensional systems .",
    "one dimensional systems @xcite actually pose a special ( and subtle ) problem with respect to understanding the two - peak rrs spectra because 1d electron systems are generically @xcite luttinger liquids ( i.e. non - fermi liquids ) which have no quasiparticle ( spe ) excitations whatsoever .",
    "the elementary excitations in 1d electron systems are bosonic spinon and holon collective modes .",
    "it is therefore conceptually problematic to comprehend how an anomalous `` spe '' feature can arise in 1d semiconductor quantum wire rrs spectra as has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "the issue of understanding 1d rrs spectra from a luttinger liquid viewpoint has been recently discussed @xcite in the literature , and we refrain from further discussing this point in this article since this is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "in particular , our use of generalized rpa enables us to develop a unified consistent theory of resonant rrs in arbitrary dimensions ( including 1d ) , and the luttinger liquid nature of 1d quantum wires is not of any relevance in our theory .",
    "we mention , however , that a complete luttinger liquid theory of 1d rrs experiments has recently been developed @xcite , and this luttinger liquid theory builds on the resonant nature of our work presented in this article .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the theory of nonresonant and resonant raman scattering process in rpa ; in sec .",
    "iii we present and discuss our calculated rrs results for one , two , and three dimensional gaas semiconductor systems ; we then summarize our work in sec .",
    "all the results shown in this paper are for gaas - based systems , but obviously the theory applies to any direct band gap semiconductor material .",
    "in fig . 1(a ) we depict the schematic diagram @xcite for the two step process ( steps 1 and 2 in the figure ) involved in the polarized resonant raman scattering spectroscopy at the @xmath11 direct gap of electron doped gaas system @xcite where an electron in the valence band is excited by the incident photon into an excited ( i.e. above the fermi level ) conduction band state , leaving a valence band hole behind ( step 1 ) ; then an electron from inside the conduction band fermi surface recombines with the hole in the valence band ( step 2 ) , emitting an outgoing photon with an energy and momentum ( stokes ) shift .",
    "the rrs process is a two - step process involving steps 1 and 2 with the net result of there being an elementary electron excitation created in the conduction band through intermediate valence band states as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the non - resonant approximation to rrs ignores the intermediate valence band states and approximates the rrs process to be taking place entirely within the conduction band of the system , as shown by the step 3 in fig .",
    "the whole point of the theory @xcite developed in this paper is that the non - resonant step 3 is not equivalent to the resonant scattering involving steps 1 and 2 .",
    "note that the resonant process involving steps 1 and 2 explicitly depends on the incident photon energy , while the non - resonant approximation depicted in step 3 depends only on the energy difference between the incident and the scattered photons and not on the incident photon energy .",
    "this difference turns out to be crucial in the rrs theory , and the resonance condition in the incident photon energy gives rise to the anomalous spe - like feature in the rrs spectra as shown below .",
    "electron spin is conserved throughout the scattering processes since we are considering only the polarized geometry where no spin flip occurs .",
    "as mentioned before we use the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in our theory taking care to generalize it to the resonant situation involving steps 1 and 2 . in the rpa one neglects all exchange - correlation effects ( e.g. self - energy and vertex corrections due to electron - electron interaction ) , including only the long range coulomb interaction @xmath12 in the dynamical screening by the electron system so as to correct the noninteracting irreducible response function to the reducible response function . following a preliminary discussion of the coulomb interaction in 1 , 2 and 3 dimensional semiconductor system in subsection a below",
    ", we then develop the nonresonant and the resonant rrs theories in sections b and c respectively .",
    "our theory is entirely within the effective mass approximation , and we parameterize the electron system in the semiconductor by electron ( @xmath13 ) and hole ( @xmath14 ) effective masses corresponding to the top ( bottom ) of the conduction ( valence ) band and by a background lattice dielectric constant @xmath15 .",
    "the realistic ( bare ) coulomb interaction in the artificially confined semiconductor nanostructures depends strongly on the confinement geometry of the systems . in the bulk",
    "3d semiconductor materials , the unscreened coulomb interaction has a long - ranged @xmath16 decay in the real space , and has the following fourier transform in momentum space : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electron charge and @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the background material ( about 12 in the gaas semiconductor system ) .",
    "we use the static ( @xmath15 ) lattice dielectric constant in our theory rather than the more conventional high frequency ( @xmath19 ) dielectric constant in defining the coulomb interaction , @xmath12 , because inclusion of @xmath15 is known to approximately account for the polaronic electron - phonon interaction in the system , which is rather weak in gaas because of its low fr@xmath20hlich coupling constant ( @xmath21 ) . in the 2d semiconductor quantum well system ,",
    "modern fabrication techniques have produced very narrow 2d wells ( of nanostructure size @xmath22   in gaas in the confinement direction ) , leading to an almost pure 2d electron system .",
    "it is therefore a good approximation to assume the well width to be zero in our calculation , giving a 2d fourier transform of the coulomb interaction : @xmath23 inclusion of the confinement wavefunction effect in the theory is straightforward and leads to a form factor @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) multiplying @xmath26 in the theory . for the 1d semiconductor quantum wire system",
    ", we have to consider the realistic finite width of the wire ( i.e. the relevant 1d form factor effect ) because the 1d fourier transform of @xmath16 potential ( i.e. @xmath27 ) diverges logarithmically requiring regularization by a length cut - off associated with the typical confinement size .",
    "therefore the coulomb interaction for the finite width quantum wire is obtained by taking the expectation value of the 2d coulomb interaction ( assuming the width in the @xmath28 direction to be zero for simplicity as in our 2d model in eq .",
    "2 ) over the confinement wavefunction along the transverse direction ( @xmath29 ) of the wire . we then have  @xcite the following coulomb interaction matrix element in the 1d qwr structure of finite width : @xmath30 for interaction between electrons of subband @xmath31 and subband @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the electron wavefunction of @xmath31th subband of the qwr along the transverse direction . in this paper",
    "we assume that only the lowest ( @xmath34 ) ground conduction subband is occupied ( i.e. subband spacing @xmath35 at zero temperature and all the higher energy subbands are empty ) and neglect any intersubband transition , so that the subband index @xmath34 throughout and will not be explicitly shown .",
    "@xmath36 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the exact form of wavefunction @xmath37 depends on the confinement geometry of the qwr system . for simplicity",
    "we assume the qwr confinement potential to be the 1d infinite square well in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "this turns out to be a good approximation for the electrostatic gate - controlled confinement in the presence of the self - consistent hartree potential due to the free electrons themselves @xcite .",
    "the the confinement wavefunction @xmath37 is ( for the ground subband ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wire width in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we can numerically calculate the effective 1d coulomb interaction @xcite for the semiconductor qwr system . unlike the power - law behavior of coulomb interaction in the higher dimensions ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) , @xmath40 has a weak logarithmic divergence , @xmath41 , in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "because of this logarithmic dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath44 ( as @xmath42 ) , the precise value of the wire width ( @xmath39 ) is not particularly important in our theory , making our simple infinite square well approximation a reasonable one for our purpose .      in the presence of an external photon field",
    "the interacting hamiltonian between the free electron gas and the radiation field is assumed to be obtainable from the standard gauge - invariant prescription  @xcite , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the radiation field ( photon ) vector potential operator and @xmath47 the speed of light .",
    "the hamiltonian including the radiation field and the electrons ( i.e. the free carriers induced by doping ) in the semiconductor conduction band can therefore be written as ( we neglect the spin - photon interaction considering only polarized rrs spectra where spins do not play any explicit role ) @xmath48}_{\\displaystyle h_0 } + \\underbrace{\\sum_i^n\\left[-\\frac{e}{m_ec}{\\mathbf{p}\\it}_i\\cdot{\\mathbf{a}\\it}({\\mathbf{x}\\it}_i , t ) + \\frac{e^{\\rm 2}}{\\rm 2\\it m_ec^{\\rm 2 } } { \\mathbf{a}\\it}({\\mathbf{x}\\it}_i , t)^{\\rm 2}\\right]}_{\\displaystyle h_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the effective mass approximation with @xmath13 being the effective electron mass of the semiconductor conduction band .",

    "the @xmath53 term creates and annihilates one photon in the state it acts on , having no contribution to the scattering rate in the first order time - dependent perturbation theory since there is no net change of photon numbers .",
    "the quadratic @xmath54 term , on the other hand , gives a non - vanishing first order contribution to the scattering rate because photons are created and annihilated at the same time in such scattering processes as shown in fig .",

    "the second order contribution of @xmath53 term in the time - dependent perturbation theory is of the the same order as the first order contribution from the @xmath54 term as a simple power counting in the coupling constant @xmath55 shows .",
    "this second order contribution , which plays a role in the rrs phenomenon , will be studied and discussed in more details in the next section .",
    "we can simply neglect this ( @xmath53 ) term in @xmath52 if we are interested only in the @xmath56resonant raman scattering regime , either because the incident photon energy @xmath0 is off - resonance i.e. far from the direct band gap , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 1.5 ev in gaas ) , or because we only want to consider a nonresonant process as in step 3 in fig .",

    "1(a ) ignoring the interband resonance process ) , the calculated rrs spectra at experimentally accessible wavevectors produce only observable cde peaks in contrast to the experimental two - peak situation which , in addition , always finds at resonance spe spectral weight to be comparable to the cde spectral weights @xcite .",
    "the nonresonant theory is therefore in qualitative disagreement with experiments as it fails to account the observed two - peak rrs spectra .    in figs .",
    "6 - 7 we show our results for the polarized rrs spectroscopy of the same 1d , 2d and 3d systems as in fig . 4 within the resonant rpa theory ( eqs .",
    "( 13)-(19 ) ) in the long wavelength region ( @xmath131=0.1 @xmath132 ) .",
    "rrs spectra for different resonance conditions , i.e. for different values of @xmath121 , are shown in fig . 6 with a larger value of the impurity broadening parameter ( @xmath135 , fifty times greater than the @xmath78 used in fig .",
    "4 ) in order to compare with the experimental rrs profiles .",
    "the lower(higher ) energy peak is associated with the spe(cde ) of the electron systems .",
    "the most important qualitative feature of the resonant theory results is the great enhancement of the spe spectral weight compared with the nonresonant theory .",
    "the three figures , figs .",
    "6(a ) , 6(b ) , and 6(c ) ( corresponding to the results of 1d , 2d , and 3d systems respectively ) have qualitatively very similar behaviors : ( i ) the overall spectral weights decay very fast off resonance ( i.e. for large @xmath136 ) ; ( ii ) the peak positions of the spe and cde in fig .",
    "6 are the same as the nonresonant excitation energies in fig .",
    "4 , i.e. resonance does not affect the energy dispersion of the elementary electronic excitations ; ( iii ) the spectral weight of spe ( lower energy peak ) is essentially zero far away from resonance ( @xmath137 ) where the cde ( higher energy peak ) dominates similar to the nonresonant spectra in fig . 4 ( except for the larger value of @xmath78 used in fig .",
    "6 ) ; ( iv ) near resonance ( @xmath138 ) the spe spectral weight is greatly enhanced  in fact , the spe spectral weight becomes comparable to or even larger than the cde spectral weight , in sharp contrast to the nonresonant theory ( where the spe weight is always extremely small at long wavelength ) . in fig .",
    "7 we plot our calculated rrs spectral weight ratio of cde / spe as a function of the resonance condition , explicitly showing the dramatic effect of resonance on the spe spectral weight .",
    "we emphasize that this spectacular enhancement of spe spectral weight in the full two step resonant scattering process ( over the simple one step nonresonant effective theory ) is a nonperturbative effect in our theory .",
    "our calculated spectra at resonance are in excellent qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental rrs spectra shown in ref.@xcite , where the spe spectral weight dies off rather quickly as the incident photon energy goes off - resonance . from our results presented in fig .",
    "7 , we also find that the spectral weight ratio of the cde to the spe has very similar resonance behaviors for systems of different dimensionalities , consistent with the experimental findings and indirectly ensuring the validity of rpa theory in the rrs spectroscopy , at least in the experimental parameter regimes .    to understand the resonance condition dependence ( on @xmath121 ) of fig .",
    "7 , we should explain the resonance effects not only on the spe continuum , but also on the cde modes around the resonance region . in some sense the extreme resonance condition ,",
    "@xmath139 , may be thought of as providing an indirect mechanism for the breakdown of the wavevector conservation for the scattering process considered only within the conduction band in the prevailing nonresonant theory where the virtual valence band effects are ignored ( i.e. step 3 in fig .",
    "1(a ) )  thus our theory preserves the essence of the `` massive '' wavevector breakdown mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in a very indirect sense because no impurity scattering is involved .",
    "instead , participation by the valence band introduces the effective mechanism for wavevector conservation `` breakdown '' through virtual interband process not included in the nonresonant theory .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath111 defined in eq .",
    "( 15 ) provides the `` wavevector conservation breaking '' mechanism by mixing conduction and valence band wavevectors non - trivially ; if @xmath111 is a constant , there is no resonant enhancement of the spe mode .",
    "equivalently , the dependence of @xmath111 on two different wavevectors is the effective wavevector conservation breakdown mechanism .",
    "mathematically we can start from the rpa dynamical structure factor defined in eq .",
    "( 16 ) , where the cde spectral weight is given by the numerator of the second term , @xmath140 , at the cde dispersion energy determined by the zero of the dielectric function ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "off - resonance , the function @xmath111 is just a slowly varying function of momentum , @xmath142 , in the integral range @xmath143 obtained by the occupancy factor , @xmath144 , in eq .",
    "( 17)-(19 ) , and therefore the rrs spectra show behavior ( i.e. the cde dominance the spe ) similar to the standard rpa results ( see fig .",
    "4 ) except for the overall decreasing weight factor , @xmath145 . near resonance ( @xmath146 ) , however , the resonance function @xmath111 in eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) can essentially cancel the contribution from the other integrand in the polarizabilities ( due to its sign change at @xmath147 ) , so that the cde spectral weight ( coming essentially from the second term in eq .",
    "( 16 ) ) can not be as strongly enhanced by resonance as the spe weight , which arises mostly from the @xmath148 in eq .",
    ". therefore the sign change of the resonant function , @xmath111 , is responsible for the relatively weaker enhancement of the cde weight compared to the spe weight near resonance .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( 16 ) , defining the resonance spectral weight in our theory , has two terms , both of which are important in giving rise to a strong spe spectral feature in the rrs spectra under resonance conditions .",
    "finally we give a simple explanation for the breakdown of luttinger liquid theory in the 1d rrs process near resonance .",
    "it is well known that 1d electron systems are best understood as a luttinger liquid , where collective excitations are the only possible excitations and no single particle excitations exist , for the conduction band electrons .",
    "however , luttinger liquid behavior depends crucially on the charge conjugation symmetry , where the hamiltonian remains the same after electrons and holes are exchanged about the fermi surface .",
    "when the valence band is intrinsically involved near resonance in the rrs process , such electron - hole conjugation symmetry is totally broken , because the filled valence band is effectively `` overlapped '' with the conduction band at fermi surface .",
    "in other words , an electron below the conduction band fermi surface now effectively has a new channel , not restricted by the small 1d phase space , to be excited above the conduction fermi surface through the two step resonant interband transition , through the valence band virtual transition .",
    "an estimated resonance condition for this apparent breakdown of ll behavior in 1d rrs spectroscopy can therefore be obtained by @xmath149 , which is 0.2 for @xmath150 and is consistent with our numerical result shown in fig .",
    "we therefore physically explain the failure of the theoretical attempt of using ll theory to study the 1d rrs experiments near resonance @xcite .",
    "the qualitative similarity of the experimental rrs results for one , two and three dimensional systems confirms our theory , which is based on the conventional fermi liquid model .",
    "we note , however , that the luttinger liquid description of 1d systems has recently been theoretically modified @xcite in an attempt to understand the observed rrs spectra , but the applicable theory is quite subtle and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in summary , it may be important to emphasize that the striking phenomenological similarity in the experimentally observed rrs spectra in one , two , and three dimensional systems is a strong indication that generic interband resonance physics as studied here ( within a _ resonant _ rpa scheme ) is playing a fundamental role in producing the low energy `` spe '' feature in the polarized rrs spectra , which can not be explained by the standard ( nonresonant ) theory or any other non - generic ( system - dependent ) theories .",
    "our theory can also be applied to the depolarized rrs experiments , where both single particle and spin density excitations are important , but the exchange energy should be included properly @xcite to separate these two excitations which are degenerate in the regular rpa calculation . once exchange correlation effects are invoked to distinguish the spe and the sde ( with the sde lying below the spe by the exchange energy ) , our resonant theory can account for the observed two - peak structure in the resonant depolarized rrs experiments in a way very similar to the theory developed herein for the spe and cde in the polarized rrs experiments . to summarize our results",
    ", we have developed a theory for resonant raman scattering spectroscopy in one , two and three dimensional semiconductor structures by considering the full two step resonance process involved in the scattering of external photons .",
    "we find that at resonance the rrs spectra have considerable weight at the spe energy with the spe weight decreasing off resonance .",
    "there is no qualitative difference in the rrs spectra between the systems of different dimensions .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings and provide a generic theoretical explanation for an ubiquitous puzzle which dates back more than twenty five years . as a concluding note we point out that it may be somewhat misleading to call the additional feature in the rrs spectra an `` anomalous '' spe mode as has routinely been done in the literature  a pure spe mode arises from the imaginary part of the irreducible polarizability function , as given within rpa by eq .",
    "( 8) , whereas the anomalous additional rrs feature arises primarily from the presence of the @xmath151 term ( eq . ( 17 ) ) in our resonant rpa theory ( eqs .",
    "( 16)-(19 ) ) which is ( related to , but ) quite different from the irreducible polarizability , @xmath152 ( eq .",
    "( 8) ) by virtue of the nontrivial nature of the resonance function @xmath111 .",
    "finally , we mention that a very recent experimental report has appeared in the literature @xcite specifically verifying the essential features of our theory @xcite .",
    "however a complete quantitative understanding of experimental results may very well require inclusion of additional effects ( e.g. excitonic corrections , many body effects ) beyond the scope of our work .",
