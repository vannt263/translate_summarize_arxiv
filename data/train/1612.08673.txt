    "one can naively define the fundamental group of a scheme as the one we expect by simply considering the underlying topological space of that scheme .",

    "we can relax this condition and settle for the usual euclidean topology on @xmath2 .",

    ", it can not distinguish among affine schemes defined by integral domains which is more commonly known as affine varieties .",
    "undeniably , they constitute an important class of schemes .",

    "there is another useful description of covering spaces .",
    "the category @xmath12 is equivalent to the functor category on the fundamental groupoid of @xmath0 with values in the category of sets .",
    "the latter category is easily seen to be complete and cocomplete .    given a space @xmath0 , let us denote by @xmath18 its universal cover and by @xmath19 its fundamental group based at @xmath20 ( we will just write @xmath21 if the group is independent of the base point , the case when for example @xmath0 is path - connected ) .",

    "the pointed coverings associated to conjugate subgroups are equivalent as coverings ( rather than pointed coverings ) .    the above discussion will be briefly referred to as the galois theory for coverings . in analogy with the galois theory for fields ,",

    "then @xmath49 acts on @xmath18 and turns @xmath50 into a covering of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath51 as a covering of @xmath0 .",
    "this defines a functor inverse to the previous one .",
    "note under this equivalence , the connected coverings are precisely the ones corresponding to homogenous @xmath21-sets . a natural question to ask is whether @xmath21 is completely determined by @xmath12 .",
    "the answer turns out to be affirmative using the following result :    [ thm1 ] the group of natural automorphisms of the forgetful functor from @xmath21-sets to sets is isomorphic to @xmath21 .    by an automorphism @xmath52 of the forgetful functor @xmath53 we mean a family of automorphism @xmath54 such that for any morphism of @xmath21-sets @xmath55 , the following commutes    @xmath56_-{\\alpha_{s } } \\ar[r(1.7)]^-{\\mathcal{f}(\\sigma ) } & & \\mathcal{f}(t ) \\ar[d(1.6)]^-{\\alpha_{t}}\\\\ & &",

    "since the categories @xmath12 and @xmath42 are equivalent , a problem concerning @xmath12 is equally difficult in @xmath42 .",
    "however , one can _ approximate _ the answer by considering nice full subcategories of @xmath42 and the automorphism group of the forgetful functors for those subcategories .",
    "for example , if one considers the full subcategory of finite dimensional @xmath21-representations , one gets the algebraic hull of @xmath21 .",
    "if one considers the full subcategory of finite @xmath21-sets , the automorphism of the forgetful functor to sets is the profinite completion of @xmath21 . in a way",
