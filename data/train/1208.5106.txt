    "the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) is variational one appropriate for quantum critical systems  @xcite .",
    "the mera for spatially @xmath1-dimensional ( @xmath1d ) systems is represented by a product of tensors , but the tensor network extends in a @xmath2-dimensional holographic space with a discrete ads@xmath3 metric .",
    "the object propagating in this extra dimension is quantum entanglement .",
    "a measure of the magnitude of the entanglement is called entanglement entropy , and usually the entropy obeys the well - known area law scaling  @xcite . in 1d critical systems ,",
    "the area law scaling is logarithmically violated  @xcite , and the mera represents the violation in terms of differential geometry in the holographic space  @xcite .    in general , non - locality or entanglement of quantum states can not be characterized by local order parameters . however , even in such a case the entanglement entropy is still a good probe or a kind of the order parameter that can detect essential features of the quantum states as they are .",
    "thus , the presence of the proper entanglement - entropy scaling within the mera network for the critical systems leads to strong constraint to the electronic properties described by the network .",
    "this means that we may do it without handling a specific hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , in the kondo problem , we can determine the kondo temperature from the wave function directly by considering a condition that the gain of the entanglement between the impurity and conduction electrons becomes stronger than the loss of the entanglement arising from temperature fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "the reason for such powerfulness is supported by recent observations that the tensor network contains enough information of conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we discuss whether the mera network can distinguish the spin - charge separation with the spin - charge coupling , depending on spatial dimensionality of our target models . since they are not classical orders , we may do it with the help of the entanglement entropy . although we do not calculate physical quantities by using a specific hamiltonian , our attention is of course the @xmath4-@xmath5 model defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are creation and annihilation operators of and electron with spin @xmath9 , at site @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are electron hopping and exchange coupling .    in",
    "spatially 1d cases , the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( or the large-@xmath12 hubbard model ) has been solved by various theoretical and numerical approaches  @xcite . the most direct one is the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "there , an electron is separated into the spin and the charge collective excitations , and they form edge singularities in the electron s one - particle spectral function . in viewpoints of bosonization , these excitations are typical examples of two - components tomonaga - luttinger liquids , and each of them can be independently described by the cft with the central charge @xmath13 .    in that sense , we may think that the original mera network is oversimplified to describe multiple - compoments cfts , although it would be the best one for single - component cfts .",
    "then , it is natural to consider the network spontaneously separates into two independent ads - like subspaces in ir region .",
    "such a concept has been introduced recently , and is called branching mera network  @xcite .",
    "unfortunatelly , the method for holographic bifurcation introduced previously is rather technical .",
    "thus , we give more physical meaning to the branching network .    for this purpose , we investigate algebraic and differential topology inherent in the network at finite temperatures . up to now",
    ", our analysis was based on a discrete version of differential geometry , since the entanglement entropy in the holographic space is proportional to a geodesic distance connecting two end points of a partial system with length @xmath14 on the original 1d lattice .",
    "apart from such a picture , now we introduce a topological view for the mera network , which requires to look at global structure of the network independent of the local metric .",
    "as will be precisely defined in the main part of this paper , the network at finite temperatures can be identified to be a topological manifold , and is characterized by the number of genera created in the ir region of the network by the presence of multiple electronic excitations . in connection with fractional quantum hall liquids ,",
    "the mera network for anyons has been examined in an algebraic manner  @xcite .",
    "our theory uses completely different topological properties . as for topological aspects",
    ", it has been well known that the topological entanglement entropy plays dominant roles on various problems in recent condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "thus , the complementary study from holographic viewpoints will give us very important insights to those problems .",
    "recently , mera is recognized to be bulk - edge correspondence similar to the ads / cft correspondence in superstring theory  @xcite . in this context , a quantity that characterises non - locality in the original quantum system located at the boundary of the ads space would be converted to a local topological object or a topologically invariant index in the holographic space .",
    "this situation is quite similar to that of the chern - simons ( cs ) theory for topologically ordered states .",
    "therefore it is important to find the index in our holographic space .",
    "although we need to introduce the ads metric in order to have some relationship between mera and ads / cft , we will find that the topology affects the geometrical relationship very strongly .",
    "importance of the topological view is closely related to usefulness of hidden order parameters such as string order parameters that sometimes appear when we would like to change statistics of quantum particles . in the case of the slave particle approach to the @xmath4-@xmath5 model",
    ", the phase string recovers the edge singularity of the spinon excitation and also zero quasiparticle spectral weight  @xcite .",
    "both of them can not be described by the slave boson mean field approximation .",
    "the string acts as a kind of gauge field connecting spinon and holon excitations .",
    "the presence of the gauge field reminds us a role of yang - mills theory on ads / cft .",
    "we expect that the phase string influences the topology of our holographic space .    here",
    ", we briefly summarize the approach for later convenience .",
    "we rewrite the original electron operator as a product of spinon and holon operators as @xmath15 where both of the spinon @xmath16 and the holon @xmath17 can be regarded as a free boson or fermion with a definite energy - momentum relation .",
    "this representation is possible when we impose the local constraint : @xmath18 which means that the local constraint given by inequality @xmath19 is transformed into the equation .",
    "then , we apply mean - field decoupling to the hamiltonian so that the spinon and the holon parts do not interact with each other .",
    "however , this process loses the edge singularity of the spinon excitation .",
    "this is because spin and charge excitations are originally collective ones , but the approximation decomposes an electron into these excitations in the local basis .",
    "rigolously speaking , the real collective modes associated with spin and charge degrees of freedom in bosonization and bethe ansatz are somehow different from the present spinon and holon excitations .",
    "thus , it may sound strange that the phase string pastes spinon and holon together and recovers the edge singularity of the spinon excitation slectrum",
    ". we should be careful for this fact in the holographic representation .",
    "in general , the unitary transformation of @xmath20 induces an additional phase factor represented by @xmath21 with @xmath22 then , the phase factor attached to eq .",
    "( [ sb2 ] ) is given by @xmath23 the spinon and the holon excitations always feel this extra phase .",
    "let us consider a situation that one spinon - holon pair is created into the mott insulator by emitting one electron at site @xmath10 outside of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "then , they propagates into opposite directions .",
    "when the holon goes to the right side of @xmath10 , the phase becomes @xmath24 , and the spinon ( or holon ) gets the phase factor .",
    "the holographic bifurcation in mera is indeed a similar process to the above method , since the bifurcation is done in real space . at the same time , the system is renormalized and goes to lower and lower energy states .",
    "then , we expect that the ir region would have important information about the phase string .",
    "actually , the network bifurcation occurs at the ir region  @xcite .",
    "we will derive a holographic description of the phase string from the topology of the branching mera network .",
    "it would be necessary to take multiple branches in many spinon - holon cases .",
    "we will also discuss the effect of multiple branches on the topological index .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first set up theoretical tools in section ii .",
    "section iii is the main part of this paper .",
    "we examine topology and geometry of our finite temperature mera network in spatially 1d cases , and give holographic description of the phase string .",

    "we have introduced the tilde tensor network as well as the network in the original hilbert space by means of thermofield dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the total variational function is defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the original tensor network and @xmath28 is its tilde conjugate .",
    "they are connected by the index @xmath9 .",
    "when they are decomposed into mera - based tensor networks ( truncated mera network ) , it has been shown that the degree of freedom characterized by the index @xmath9 represents an ads black hole  @xcite .",
    "we show a schematic viewgraph of the combined network @xmath29 in fig .",
    "hereafter , we name the combined network as a topological manifold @xmath30 . because of the following technical reasons , we assume rotational invariance of @xmath30 ( see the positions of indices @xmath31 in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "mathematically , the assumption means @xmath32 for all @xmath10 and for all effective site indices in renormalized layers . in the absence of the branching networks , this is simple rotation associated with symmetry between the original and the tilde hilbert spaces .",
    "however , in the presence of the two branches , the branching position does not obey the rotational symmetry , but the mirror symmetry with respect to the event horizon .    in the continuous limit",
    ", the metric of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) is given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a proper function that becomes zero for @xmath35 , where the network is terminated at @xmath36 .",

    "note that they are spatially separated in the slave particle formalism , and different from real corrective excitations . at finite temperatures , the modification in ir region of @xmath30 ( near the black hole horizon )",
    "necessarily induces a defect in this manifold as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . due to the presence of the defect ,",
    "the manifold @xmath30 is topologically equivalent to a m@xmath0bius strip of euler characterisric @xmath46 , if we could couple @xmath47 with @xmath48 for all @xmath10 and impose a twisted boundary condition for the left and the right edges of our finite - size system .",
    "the former condition is natural , since they are maximally entangled .",
    "now , we consider the two branches that represents spinon and holon excitations . then , we can not introduce a simple periodic boundary condition along @xmath49 direction so that they are not connected directly .",
    "as for the latter condition , the spinon @xmath50 ( holon @xmath51 ) couples with its ancilla @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we can see the coupling through the centerline on the strip ,    a method for homeomorphic ( topologically invariant ) transformation of our manifold into the strip is shown in fig .",

    "we also define @xmath55 for @xmath56 , since @xmath57 represents the number of spinon - holon pairs . then , @xmath30 has @xmath57-genera [ euler characteristic @xmath58 , and we call @xmath30 as genus-@xmath57 network or genus-@xmath57 manifold",
    ". figure  [ fig3 ] is a genus-@xmath59 network . in this case , the defect is transformed into the genus .",
    "later we will give more conclete formulation .",
    "in addition , the m@xmath0bius strip has a single boundary representing a close loop covering the genus edge . starting from a particular boundary point",
    ", we go back to the original position by two loops .",
    "thus , we get a phase @xmath24 per loop .",
    "this phase is closely related to eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) , and in the next section we consider the mechanism of the duality .",
    "the phase string in the slave particle formalism is an extended object because it connects a spinon with a holon moving into opposite directions .",
    "however , the genus is in some sense local ( and static ) before taking the twisted boundary conditions , since the inside of the genus does not contain isometry tensors .",
    "this means that the area of the genus should be infinitesimally small when we introduce a proper metric near the genus .",
    "this fact is also consistent with duality requirement .",
    "a very simple argument is that @xmath54 characterizes the number of the excitation modes at low temperatures .",
    "however , this is an important fact .",
    "when the genus varnishes with increasing temperature and the spinon and the holon branches are smeared out by temperature fluctuation , the system undergoes the topologically different state [ @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ] . according to bulk - edge correspondence in topological systems , an evidence of this hidden topological transition",
    "would be detected by the topological entanglement entropy at the boundary of our ads space .",
    "unfortunately , it would be hard to do large - scale numerical simulation for the study of temperature dependence of the entanglement entropy in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model . in the present stage",
    ", we do not have numerical evidence of the topological transition in specific models .    if we cut the strip along the horizon",
    ", the system becomes a long strip and the twist is released .",
    "here we suppose that the cut generates the ground state .",
    "only that point seems to be singular in our representation of the variational function . in the original formulation of the mera network in the ground state ,",
    "the lowest energy layer is capped by the top tensor , and that means separation of @xmath30 into two independent mera networks . in the present case",
    ", the top tensor still has an additional index that connects with the ancilla space in order to keep the @xmath24 phase .",
    "this indicates that the proper variational function depends on the number of the excitation modes in the original quantum systems .",
    "let us formulate the correspondence between the phase string and the @xmath24 phase of m@xmath0bius strip more precisely .",

    "the tensor operation to @xmath75 changes the basis state .",

    "these features well explain the strong mixing of spin and charge excitations in 2d .",
    "an equation of motion approach for the @xmath4-@xmath5 model shows that the composite electrons dressed with charge and spin fluctuation strongly couple with each other particularly near the wave vector @xmath158 for nearly optimum hole doping where the presence of the quantum critical point is expected  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the coupling and the separation among various quantum degrees of freedom depend on spatial dimensionality .    in viewpoints of exotic electronic states",
    "realized in 2d , such as high-@xmath159 superconductivity , we would like to determine the metric of this system and calculate physical quantities .",
    "recently , ads / cft has been applied to the examination of such electronic states  @xcite .",
    "it is important to study relatioship between them and our approach .",
    "to undestand the separation and the coupling of various quantum degrees of freedom are always fundamental issues in the study of strongly correlated electron systems . the present study opens a unique route to look at such a feature in the holographic space . in order to proceed theoretical examination in realistic models",
    ", it will be a first step to calculate the holographic entanglement entropy ( geodesic distance ) , and to compare it with the topological entanglement entropy in the original quantum system .",
    "fortunately , the metric of the branching mera network has been obtained in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) ( we need to embed it into hyperbolic space ) .",
    "our future work will be such calculation straightforwardly .    summarizing ,",
    "we have examined various topological aspects associated with bulk - edge correspondence of branching mera networks at finite temperatures .",
    "the topological view is quite important .",
    "even if we do not introduce the metric , we can pick up fundamental electronic properties of our target models by analysing topology of our holographic space . in terms of strongly correlated electron physics , our examination is closely related to the spin - charge separation and coupling based on the slave particle formalism as well as the phase string in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model .",
    "we have found that a holographic dual of the phase string is the twist of the network along the genus created in the ir region .",
    "we have also examined the stability of the branching networks in connection with the second law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "then , we have proved that the mera network for one - dimensional quantum critical systems spontaneously separates into multiple branches in the ir region of the network , while the branch does not occur in more than two dimensions .",
    "the sharp difference clearly illustrates the spin - charge separation in 1d , and the spin - charg ecoupling in 2d .",
    "our finding , that a holographic dual of the phase string is the network topology , is realistic extension of the cs theory , and will provide us unique topological properties of extra dimension .",
    "the cs theory is a kind of bulk - edge correspondence , and is considered to be a toy model of ads / cft .",
    "this is because the cs theory introduces fictitious gause field and does not treat gravitation explicitly .",
    "my approach treats topological properties of our spacetime as the cs theory does , but is basically an ads / cft - oriented method .",
    "i hope that the present result contributes to bringing up more golobal and essential viewpoints for bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "_ note added : _ in recent arxiv by t. takayanagi et at .",
    "@xcite , they have briefly commented on the mera for topologically ordered phases and its connection to d - branes  @xcite .",
    "there , the top tensor of mera contains topological information such as ground - state degeneracy . in my case",
    ", the top tensor is separated into some parts , and in this case the topology around them becomes also important .",
