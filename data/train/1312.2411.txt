    "since the discovery of human blood groups in  1900 , their distributions in various countries and ethnicities have been attracting attention of researchers @xcite .",
    "such distributions vary a lot across the world @xcite and , in general , evolve over time  @xcite .",
    "it is classically known that in the absence of evolutionary influences the allele frequency of a single trait achieves the hardy - weinberg equilibrium @xcite already in the second generation and then remains constant  @xcite .",
    "besides , blood groups frequencies satisfy an algebraic relation  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the frequencies of all possible genotypes or phenotypes combinations of a pair of genes ( even though their frequencies are uncorrelated ) is however much more complex  @xcite . for a random initial population",
    ", the frequencies of all possible combinations of blood group and rh factor phenotypes will only stabilize after an infinitely long evolution .    by computing the linkage disequilibria between alleles",
    "one can , in principle , find the frequency of any genotype in a given generation  @xcite .",
    "however , finding explicit analytic formulas for the evolution of genotypes frequencies and invariant varieties of the polynomial dynamical system describing this evolution is a problem of great computational complexity . in the present paper",
    "we develop a symbolic solution technique which allows us to give a closed form description of the evolutionary trajectory .",
    "we show how the frequencies of human blood genotypes ( distinguished by both blood group and rh factor variations ) with arbitrary initial distribution will evolve after any given number of generations in a population where no blood genotype is favored over another with respect to the ability to pass its genes to the next generation .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we will be denoting the blood group traits by a , b , o , and the rh factor traits by h ( positive ) and h ( negative ) .",
    "the 18 human blood genotypes in the abo rh system will be denoted by oohh ( rh negative 1st blood group ) , aohh , aahh , bohh , bbhh , abhh , oohh , aohh , aahh , bohh , bbhh , abhh , oohh , aohh , aahh , bohh , bbhh , and abhh ( homozygously rh positive 4th blood group ) . in the sequel , we will always be using this particular ordering of the blood genotypes . since a and b traits",
    "are codominant over o while the h trait is dominant over h , the above genotypes comprise the 8 blood phenotypes : oh ( rh negative 1st blood group , same as oohh ) , ah ( rh negative 2nd blood group comprising genotypes aohh and aahh ) , bh , abh , oh , ah ( rh positive 2nd blood group comprising genotypes aohh , aohh , aahh , aahh ) , bh , and abh .    in demography and transfusiology , it is often important to know and predict the frequencies of blood genotypes or phenotypes with respect to _ both _ blood group and rh factor @xcite .",
    "for instance , one would like to know the expected frequency of the rh negative 4th blood group after a given number of years in a certain population . as we will see later , the convergence of the blood genotypes frequencies towards the limit distribution is rather slow ( in the real time scale ) for generic choice of their initial distribution .",
    "for instance , table  1 shows that for @xmath0 the frequency of the oh genotype in example  [ ex : examplewithtable ] below after two generations is  0.109 while its equilibrium value is  0.187 .",
    "moreover , the limit distribution might not be ever reached for a particular real population because of migration and evolutionary influences that affect the blood genotypes frequencies @xcite .",
    "the hardy - weinberg result gives the equilibrium genotypes frequencies after an infinitely long evolution and the bernstein equation @xcite relates these frequencies in a population that is already at the equilibrium .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to fill the gap between an initial distribution and the equilibrium state ( that is in general only achieved after an infinitely long evolution ) by giving an explicit closed form analytic formula for the frequencies distribution .",
    "we describe the evolution of the frequencies of all possible genotypes of human blood in the clinically most important abo and rh blood group systems for an arbitrary initial distribution of these frequencies and after any number of generations .",
    "we will be assuming that blood group and rh factor are statistically correlated neither with gender nor with fertility or any aspect of sexual behavior of a human .",
    "that is , we will consider a population where an individual s chances to pass her / his genes to the next generation do not depend on her / his blood genotype .",
    "since we assume that blood genotypes frequencies are uncorrelated with gender , their distribution is the same for males and females .",
    "the blood genotype distribution in such a population is therefore completely determined by a vector with 18 real nonnegative components @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the frequency of oohh , @xmath3 is the frequency of aohh , etc .",
    "( see the ordering of the blood genotypes introduced above ) .",
    "we will only consider vectors not all of whose components are zero since zero population has trivial dynamics .",
    "moreover , since we are only interested in the proportions of the population having prescribed blood genotypes , we will identify proportional vectors .",
    "thus for the purpose of studying blood genotypes dynamics a population is identified with a point in the 17-dimensional projective space  @xmath4    let @xmath5 be the vector encoding the blood genotypes distribution in a population . using the well - known blood inheritance rules @xcite together with the above statistical assumptions on the population under study , we conclude that the distribution of blood genotypes in the next generation is described by the vector whose components are the following 18 quadratic forms :    @xmath6 for instance , the polynomial @xmath7 can be obtained by observing that the only blood genotypes that contribute to the frequency of the genotype oohh in the next generation are oohh , aohh , bohh , oohh , aohh , and bohh .",
    "recall that their frequencies in the initial generation are denoted by @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . in a family where both parents blood belongs to the oohh genotype , 100% of the children will have the same blood .",
    "an offspring of the parents with the blood genotype aohh will have blood of the type oohh with the probability 1/4 .",
    "computing the probabilities for an offspring to have blood of the type oohh for all possible combinations of the parents blood genotypes and clearing common denominators ( this makes use of our projective model and must be done for all components of the polynomial map ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) simultaneously ) , we arrive at @xmath11 the other components of  ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) are obtained by means of similar arguments .",
    "the polynomials ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) vary greatly in their complexity and three patterns are easily distinguishable .",
    "the polynomials that are squares of linear forms , that is , @xmath12 @xmath13 correspond to blood genotypes that are homozygous for both blood group and rh factor .",
    "the polynomials that are products of two different linear forms , that is , @xmath14 @xmath15 correspond to the blood genotypes that are homozygous for either blood group or rh factor but not both .",
    "finally , the three complicated polynomials @xmath16 are the counterparts of the fully heterozygous genotypes aohh , bohh , and abhh .    observe that no particular population growth model has been used for computing the polynomials @xmath17 since our goal is to compute the frequencies of the blood genotypes in the next generation no matter how",
    "numerous it is .",
    "( it only has to be numerous enough for the law of large numbers to hold . )",
    "choosing a particular growth model would result in multiplying the polynomials @xmath17 with a common normalizing function .",
    "thus the distribution of the blood genotypes in the next generation is completely described by the polynomial vector - valued function @xmath18 @xmath19 from the projective space @xmath20 into itself : @xmath21 such a map defines a polynomial dynamical system .",
    "finding blood genotypes distributions in subsequent generations means computing the sequence of iterates @xmath22 of the polynomial vector - valued function  @xmath23 here @xmath24 is what the initial distribution @xmath25 evolves into after @xmath26 generations .",
    "typically a polynomial dynamical system on a complex manifold does not admit an explicit analytic description of the trajectory of a generic point",
    ". the vast majority of the results in complex dynamics are ergodic - theoretic in nature @xcite .",
    "however , the biological origin of the dynamical system  ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) suggests that it should not exhibit any chaotic behavior .",
    "the polynomial dynamical system  ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) is the main object of study in the paper .",
    "we aim to find an explicit symbolic description of the orbit of any initial distribution of human blood genotypes frequencies under the action of  ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) and to describe its rate of convergence towards the equilibrium",
    ".    it will often be convenient to identify a distribution of blood genotypes in a population with a linear form whose coefficients are proportions of people with given blood genotypes and whose formal variables are the 18 blood genotypes names oohh , aohh ,  , abhh .",
    "for instance , the linear form @xmath27oohh + @xmath28abhh denotes the population where @xmath29 people have blood genotype oohh and @xmath30 people have genotype abhh .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following statement .",
    "[ thm : maintheorem ] the initial distribution of blood genotypes frequencies @xmath31 @xmath32 will after  @xmath33 generations evolve into the distribution @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the @xmath36-th component of the image of the initial distribution @xmath37 under the linear map @xmath38 defined by the matrix @xmath39 while @xmath40 is the quadratic map @xmath41 defined by @xmath42    although @xmath26 stands for the integer number of iterations of the polynomial map @xmath43 the formula ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) makes perfect sense for any real @xmath44 as we will see later in section  [ sec : discussion ] , it provides a smooth interpolation of the blood genotypes frequencies in subsequent generations described by our discrete model .    having the explicit expression ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) for the @xmath26th iterate of a polynomial map  ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) , it is tempting to try to prove it by induction .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath46 in @xmath20 ( that is , these two polynomial vectors are proportional for any @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus it only remains to show that @xmath47 while this brute force approach must , in principle , lead to a straightforward proof of the theorem , the difficulty lies in the considerable complexity and the high dimensionality of the polynomial dynamical system ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) .",
    "in fact , the first component of the vector @xmath48 is the square of a polynomial of degree 4 with 110490 monomials . other components of this vector are at least as complex as the first one . while modern supercomputers theoretically allow one to deal with polynomials of this size , it is a task of formidable computational complexity to carry out such a calculation .",
    "the author s attempts to perform it on nvidia tesla m2090 supercomputer platform with a peak performance of 16.872  tflops ( linpack tested ) were all unsuccessful .",
    "besides , it would not provide any explanation for how  ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) arose . for these reasons we will follow a different way of proving theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] .    throughout the proof , we will be working with projective coordinates of blood genotypes distributions .",
    "thus all the equalities below will relate vectors in projective spaces meaning that two nonzero vectors are equal if and only if they are proportional .",
    "let @xmath49 @xmath50 be the vector encoding the initial blood genotypes distribution in a population .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the action of the polynomial map  ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) on @xmath25 is given by @xmath51 here @xmath35 is the @xmath36-th component of the image of the initial distribution @xmath37 under the linear map @xmath38 defined by the matrix  ( [ matrixm ] ) .",
    "we further observe that the matrix  @xmath52 has tensor product structure : @xmath53 this equality is the algebraic counterpart of the blood genotypes inheritance rule stating that the blood group variation and the rh factor variation are inherited independently .",
    "we define the map @xmath54 to be the composition of the linear map @xmath52 and the quadratic map @xmath40 defined by ( [ mapq ] ) in the reversed order : @xmath55 using ( [ eq : tensorproductdecomposition ] ) we conclude that the @xmath26-th iterate @xmath56 of the quadratic map @xmath57 acts on @xmath58 in accordance with the formula @xmath59 it follows from  ( [ eq : polynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) that @xmath60 recalling that @xmath61 and using  ( [ eq : mandqinreversedorder ] ) we arrive at  ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "recall that we identify proportional distributions , so  ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) can be divided by the sum of its components or any other normalizing common factor .",
    "the following statement is an immediate consequence of theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] .",
    "blood genotypes frequencies after infinitely many generations are obtained by passing to the limit in  ( [ eq : blooddistrafterngenerations ] ) .",
    "they are given by the tensor product of the hardy - weinberg equilibrium frequencies of the blood groups variations and rh factor variations .",
    "these frequencies span an attracting invariant manifold of the dynamical system ( [ eq : explicitpolynomialdynamicalsystem ] ) .",
    "describing evolutionary trajectories of initial distributions of genotypes frequencies with respect to a given set of traits is a classical avenue of research in population genetics .",
    "while theorem  [ thm : maintheorem ] is a formal consequence of the lyubich general evolution formula , see    11 in @xcite , few cases admit explicit description .    [",
