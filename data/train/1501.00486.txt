    "recent years have witnessed the emergence of the idea of accelerating universe and due to some observational results @xcite it is now established that the universe is accelerating .",
    "this acceleration is caused by some unknown matter dubbed as dark energy .",
    "this dark energy has the positive energy density and strong negative pressure that satisfies equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the present acceleration is also confirmed by other observations like large scale structure @xcite , cmbr @xcite and wmap @xcite .",
    "the observations predict that the present universe occupies @xmath1 4% ordinary matter , @xmath1 74% dark energy and @xmath1 22% dark matter .",
    "the most simple candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath2 which satisfies the eos parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "another candidates of dark energy are quintessence ( where eos parameter satisfies @xmath4 ) @xcite and phantom ( where eos parameter satisfies @xmath5 ) @xcite . a brief review of dark energy models is found in the ref .",
    "the unified dark fluid ( udf ) model @xcite was investigated extensively in the recent years .",
    "the main features of the udf model are that it combines cold dark matter and dark energy and that it behaves like the cold dark matter and the dark energy at an early epoch and a late time respectively however the approach remains purely phenomenological . in recent years",
    ", an increasing number of cosmological observations suggest that our universe is filled with imperfect fluid which contains bulk viscosity which has negative pressure @xcite .",
    "the viscous generalized chaplygin gas model is one of the suitable candidate of unified dark energy and cold dark matter as a unique imperfect dark fluid @xcite .    while dark energy may be modeled as a fluid with negative pressure acting against gravitational collapse , dark matter ( in its cold version )",
    "is a dust - like fluid with no pressure , therefore enhancing the collapse of matter perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is very important to investigate the evolutions of density perturbations within realistic cosmological model ( for recent reviews , see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "fabris et al @xcite studied the evolution of density perturbations in a universe dominated by the chaplygin gas .",
    "their model shows the required density contrast observed in large scale structure of the universe , however their approach remained newtonian .",
    "similar investigations were performed by carturan and finelli for the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "fernandes et al @xcite have investigated the non - linear collapse of generalized chaplygin gas in the frame of spherical top - hat collapse ( sthc ) .",
    "recently carames @xcite investigated the spherical collapse model using viscous generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "li et al @xcite have extended the above work by considering bulk viscosity in the general chaplygin gas model . besides the parameter @xmath6",
    ", they have also analyzed the effect of bulk viscosity on the structure formation of the variable generalized chaplygin gas model which has a spherically symmetric perturbation .    in our work ,",
    "we focus on the collapse of a spherically symmetric perturbation , with a classical top - hat profile , to study the nonlinear evolution of viscous modified chaplygin gas perturbations in einstein s gravity as well as in loop quantum cosmology in sections ii and iii respectively .",
    "the conclusion is present in the last section iv .",
    "we consider a flat friedmann robertson - walker ( frw ) universe described by the following metric @xmath7.\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "we assume that the spacetime is filled with only one component fluid having a bulk viscosity .",
    "the einstein s field equations are given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter , @xmath12 is the energy density and the effective pressure @xmath13 can be expressed as follows @xmath14 which is the sum of the equilibrium pressure @xmath15 and the bulk pressure @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the four velocity of the fluid and @xmath18 is the coefficient of bulk viscosity and is a function of energy density .",
    "the first attempts at creating a viscosity theory of relativistic fluids were executed by eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite who considered only a first - order deviation from equilibrium .",
    "the bulk viscous pressure @xmath19 is represented by the eckart s expression which is proportional to the hubble parameter @xmath20 with proportionality factor identified as the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath18 which is defined by @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants . for simplicity ,",
    "choosing @xmath24 , @xmath19 can be written as @xcite @xmath25    the chaplygin gas is generally characterized by the equation of state ( pressure is inversely proportional to the energy density ) : @xmath26 .",
    "this equation of state has an interesting connection with the @xmath27-branes which are expressed via nambu - goto action @xcite .",
    "it also enjoys connections with the newtonian hydrodynamical equations .",
    "further the eddington - born - infeld model can be seen as an affine connection version for the chaplygin gas approach @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas has been extensively studied within the unified dark energy - dark matter models as well @xcite .",
    "therefore we choose the equation of state for modified chaplygin gas as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath6 are constants which are constrained by the astrophysical data ( for recent constraints , see @xcite ) .",
    "the modified chaplygin gas satisfactorily accommodates an accelerating phase followed by a matter dominated phase of the universe .",
    "it is also consistent with the observational studies dealing with the large scale structure @xcite . hence combining the equations ( 4 ) to ( 6 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath31 which is called viscous modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg ) @xcite .",
    "hence by choosing the above equation of state , we extend previous works dealing with viscous linear equation of state ( @xmath32 ) and viscous generalized chaplygin gas ( @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "it may also be termed as a ` viscous unified dark fluid ' .",
    "the conservation equation is given by @xmath34 now using equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) , we obtain the solution @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant of integration .",
    "now using the redshift formula @xmath37 ( choosing @xmath38 ) , equation ( 9 ) can be re - written in the form : @xmath39^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the present value of the density and @xmath41  with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "hence the hubble parameter is obtained as @xmath44 @xmath45^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the present value of dimension density parameter and @xmath47 .",
    "the equation of state parameter is given by @xmath48 while the adiabatic sound speed reads @xmath49 note that the chaplygin gas model is a dynamical dark energy model as well and dark energy perturbations play crucial role in dynamical dark energy models as well @xcite .",
    "the spherical collapse ( sc ) which provides a way to glimpse into the nonlinear regime of perturbation theory was introduced firstly by gunn and gott @xcite .",
    "the sc describes the evolution of a spherically symmetric perturbation embedded in a homogeneous background , which can be static , expanding or collapsing .",
    "one assumes a spherical ` top - hat ' profile for the perturbed region , i.e. , a spherically symmetric perturbation in some region of space with constant density .",
    "following the assumption of a top - hat profile , namely the density perturbation is uniform throughout the collapse , so the evolution of perturbation is only time - dependent .",
    "the perturbed quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to their background counterparts by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "now the perturbed equation of state @xmath54 is given by @xcite @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 and perturbed square of the sound speed is given by @xmath58}{\\delta(\\delta+1)^{\\alpha}\\rho^{1+\\alpha } } -\\frac{3\\xi_{0}h}{(\\sqrt{1+\\delta}+1)\\sqrt{\\rho}}.\\ ] ] in the spherical top - hat collapse model , the background evolution equations are still in the forms @xcite : @xmath59 @xmath60    for the perturbed region , the basic equations which depend on local quantities can be written as @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the local expansion rate and @xmath64 is the local scale factor and furthermore , @xmath65 relates to local expansion rate in the sthc framework @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the divergence of the peculiar velocity @xmath68 .    after some calculations @xcite , the dynamical equations of density contrast @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be obtained in the following forms : @xmath71\\frac{\\theta}{a^{2}h}~,\\ ] ] @xmath72 where , @xmath73   and @xmath74 represents the derivative w.r.t .",

    "<S> * abstract : * in this work , we focus on the collapse of a spherically symmetric perturbation , with a classical top - hat profile , to study the nonlinear evolution of only viscous modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg ) perturbations in einstein s gravity as well as in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) . in the perturbed region , we have investigated the natures of equation of state parameter , square speed of sound and another perturbed quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been analyzed by numerical and graphical investigations . </S>"
