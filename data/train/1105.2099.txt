    "<S> early phases of the chemical evolution and formation history of extremely metal poor ( emp ) stars are investigated using hierarchical galaxy formation models . </S>",
    "<S> we build a merger tree of the galaxy according to the extended press - schechter theory . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the chemical evolution along the tree , and compare the model results to the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) and abundance ratio distribution of the milky way halo . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt three different initial mass functions ( imfs ) . in a previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that typical mass of emp stars should be high - mass(@xmath0 ) based on studies of binary origin carbon - rich emp stars . in this study , we show that only the high - mass imf can explain a observed small number of emp stars . for relative element abundances , </S>",
    "<S> the high - mass imf and the salpeter imf predict similar distributions . we also investigate dependence on nucleosynthetic yields of supernovae ( sne ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical sn yields by kobayashi et al.(2006 ) and chieffi & limonge ( 2004 ) show reasonable agreement with observations for @xmath1-elements . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts significant scatter of element abundances at @xmath2}<-3 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> best fit yields for one zone chemical evolution model by francois et al.(2004 ) well reproduces the trend of the typical abundances of emp stars but our model with their yield predicts much larger scatter of abundances than the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the model with hypernovae predicts zn abundance in agreement with observations but other models predict lower @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> ejecta from the hypernovae with large explosion energy is mixed in large mass and decreases scatter of the element abundances . </S>"
