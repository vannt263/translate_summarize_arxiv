    "traditional modeling encompasses statistical approaches , like the preisach one , as well as micromagnetics @xcite . while the former allow to describe the hysteresis loop of macroscopic samples without any clue on the real microscopic domain dynamics , the latter can be used to access the fine details of the domain structure and motion , although the higher computational cost limits the size of the treatable systems .",
    "an intermediate phase - field approach exists which , starting from the micromagnetics equations , by means of suitable approximations , allow to investigate the detailed domain dynamics in ffs over large length - scales such as the ones accessible to magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) , few @xmath0m@xmath1 , or to optical techniques , hundreds of @xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "the first numerical works using this approach have been performed by e. jagla who investigated the possible stable and unstable domain patterns in thin perpendicular anisotropy ffs @xcite and the role of the domain dynamics in determining the hysteresis loop shape @xcite . in more recent works",
    "the same kind of modeling has been adopted to investigate return point memory effects @xcite , barkhausen avalanche distributions and critical exponents @xcite , and the role of defects in the domain reorientation under the influence of an oscillating external field @xcite .",
    "recently we have also demonstrated that this kind of modeling reproduces quantitatively both the domain dynamics at the micro - scale and the macroscopic hysteresis properties of exchange - bias co / pt multilayers @xcite .",
    "the starting point for the study of the domain dynamics is the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( llge ) , ruling the precession motion of the magnetization vector @xmath2 , associated to the infinitesimal medium volume @xmath3 , around a local field @xmath4 due to the presence of the rest of the medium and to external sources : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the giromagnetic ratio of the electron spin and @xmath7 is a characteristic damping time of the material , representing the irreversible energy transfer to microscopic degrees of freedom such as magnons , phonons , and eddy - currents .",
    "the magnetization can be written as @xmath8 , separating its modulus , i.e. the saturation magnetization @xmath9 , a material parameter , from the dimensionless versor @xmath10 . defining the dimensionless constant @xmath11 , in the limit @xmath12 , ( [ llg ] )",

    "the field @xmath15 depends on the material properties and on the sample shape and it is known once the system hamiltonian @xmath16 is given : @xmath17}{\\delta \\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{r},t)}+\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{r},t ) .",

    "+ micromagnetic simulations can be performed starting from ( [ llg2 ] ) and evolving the magnetization in time on a three dimensional mesh @xcite , the field @xmath15 felt by every magnetic dipole , associated to the infinitesimal medium volume , will be the sum of the filed due to all the other dipoles .",
    "this non locality , together with the full vectorial treatment of the problem , is responsible for the high computational cost of this kind of simulations limiting the size of the simulated samples .",
    "however , to describe the physics of certain systems with a specific symmetry , one component of the magnetization might be more relevant than the others .",
    "this is the case of perpendicular anisotropy ff in which , except for the domain wall regions , the magnetization is mostly aligned perpendicular to the film plane as depicted in figure [ figure2](a ) . in this simplified picture",
    "the magnetization is assumed to be uniform along the @xmath22 axis , in the approximation of thin domain walls @xcite , only its @xmath22 component plays a relevant role , thus the domain dynamics can be solely described by a scalar function @xmath23 varying on the film plane only , i.e. @xmath24 .",

    "the second step comes from a simple integration by parts , taking into account that the magnetization is directed along @xmath22 only and does not vary along the film thickness , i.e. is not a function of @xmath22 .",
    "we can write explicitly the energy substituting ( [ sega ] ) into ( [ minchia ] ) : @xmath47 having in mind the streamlines of the magnetic field generated by a single dipole moment , it is easy to understand that , in order to minimize the total energy , each dipole tries to align oppositely the neighboring ones . + due to electronic interactions the system gains energy leaving the neighboring dipoles aligned along the same direction .",
    "the hamiltonian term accounting for this behavior must contain a space derivative of @xmath34 in order to lose energy at every spatial variation of the magnetization : @xmath48 ^ 2\\ ; d^3\\mathbf{r},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the exchange stiffness , representing the energy cost to misalign neighboring dipole moments , and the square is necessary to treat in the same way upward and downward spatial variations .",

    "if we power expand the second term in the r.h.s of ( [ orco2 ] ) for small @xmath30 , we see that the zero order contribution cancels out with the first term leaving only the contribution in @xmath59 ( the first order contribution is zero for parity reasons ) : @xmath60 from this simplified expression the tendency of the stray field to anti - align the dipole moments is immediately clear : if the spin at the point @xmath44 is oriented in the same direction of the one at @xmath45 the product @xmath61 is positive and the total energy increase , to gain energy the two spin at @xmath44 and @xmath45 must be oppositely oriented so that @xmath62 . + it is also important to notice that , when completely saturated , i.e. @xmath63 , the ff behaves like a uniformly charged plane capacitor .",
    "this means that the outer field is zero while the inner one is constant and it depends only on the material parameters .",
    "the field expression ( [ campo ] ) , with @xmath64 , at zero temperature and in absence of any external field becomes : @xmath65 the integrand depends only on @xmath66 , if the film is infinitely extended along @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we have translational invariance , i.e. the integral over @xmath69 gives the same result for every @xmath44",
    ". we can exploit this symmetry to solve the integral for the convenient choice @xmath70 : @xmath71 the second step has been obtained moving to polar coordinates .",
    "the same can be done for the energy density , i.e. the integrand in the r.h.s . of ( [ full ] ) which , for @xmath72 and calculated in the infinitesimal volume @xmath3 centered at @xmath70 , reads @xmath73 again the last step holds for small @xmath30 .      under the influence of an external magnetic field @xmath74 ,",
    "the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material can be manipulated , promoting nucleation , growth and coalescence of domains .",
    "however the magnetization does not vary smoothly with the external field strength , its dynamics is characterized by sudden jumps due to the discontinuous motion of the domain walls pinned by crystalline defects and grain boundaries , these jumps are known as barkhausen avalanches .",
    "the disorder and the inhomogeneities of the material serve also as nucleation points at the initial stage of the magnetization reversal process .",
    "the pinning effect due to the sample inhomogeneities can be included in our model by letting one ore more material properties fluctuate randomly on the @xmath38 plane .",
    "contrary to the disorder introduced by thermal fluctuations which changes in time , this new source of randomness is fixed once and for all at @xmath75 .",
    "the fluctuation can be introduced in the anisotropy constant ( random anisotropy model ) , in the exchange stiffness constant ( random bond model ) or simply by means of a magnetic field @xmath76 ( random field model ) : @xmath77,\\cr a(\\mathbf{r})= a \\ ; [ 1-c\\ ; p(\\mathbf{r})],\\cr h_{random}(\\mathbf{r})=c\\ ; p(\\mathbf{r } ) , } \\label{rumore}\\ ] ] here @xmath78 is a parameter determining the amplitude of the fluctuations , i.e. the strength of the pinning inhomogeneities , @xmath29 and @xmath49 are the macroscopic average material parameter , and @xmath79 is a gaussian stochastic process with @xmath80 and a given correlation @xmath81 .",
    "+ as we will see in section [ imp ] , the llge must be solved numerically on a discrete mesh of spacing @xmath82 , if this quantity is bigger than the characteristic length scale of the ff inhomogeneities , the pinning disorder fluctuations will be uncorrelated ( white noise ) , i.e. @xmath83 . more generally , the disorder can be correlated on a characteristic length scale dictated by the micro - structure of the ff , for instance the average crystalline grain size . a correlated random field has been recently used to study how the domain dynamics is affected by the presence of uncompensated spins , at the interface between ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic films , in exchange - bias systems @xcite .",
    "+ the physics of the three fluctuating noises is of course different : the fluctuations entering the hamiltonian through the anisotropy or the exchange terms , which are quadratic in @xmath23 , are not sensitive to the magnetization sign , i.e. they serve as nucleation points for both upward and downward oriented domains , and the up - to - down and down - to - up hysteresis semi - loops are exactly identical ( with the same domain patterns ) . to have different nucleation points in the two hysteresis branches , we need to use a random field model ,",
    "its hamiltonian term is linear in @xmath23 and thus sensitive to the magnetization sign .",
    "typically , in a real ff , all the three sources of randomness are simultaneously present .      .",

    "the characteristic average domain width is set by the competition of the stray field and the energy cost of a wall , while the former tends to create a large amount of small domains , to demagnetize the film , the latter tries to minimize the number of domain walls and thus of domains .",
    "as explicitly visible from ( [ orco2 ] ) , the stray field strength depends solely on the film thickness , thus at fixed @xmath30 , the domain size can be tuned varying the domain wall cost only and it goes as @xmath85 . on the other hand , working with a given material , we can tune the domain width by choosing properly the film thickness , the thickness dependence is however non - trivial @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] ( a ) shows the magnetization @xmath25 resulting from two different simulations with the same thickness but different @xmath86 product . again starting from ( [ full ] )",
    "it is easy to show that the domain wall thickness goes as @xmath84 , figure [ figure3 ] ( b ) shows how the simulated domain walls get narrower as we decrease the @xmath87 ratio . for many ferromagnetic materials the @xmath29 and @xmath49 values",
    "are tabulated @xcite , for thin films and multilayers they are known to be dependent on the thickness and deposition conditions .",
    "however , @xmath29 and @xmath49 can also be estimated starting from a measured domain image , in fact , knowing both the real domain width and domain wall thickness we fix both the product @xmath86 and the ration @xmath87 , and a unique couple of values for @xmath29 and @xmath49 which satisfies both the conditions exists .",
    "using this idea we can extract the @xmath29 and @xmath49 values directly from the simulations once the simulated domain morphology resembles the measured one @xcite . for co",
    "/ pt multilayers we found a very good agreement between the calculated and experimentally estimated @xmath29 values whereas for @xmath49 we always found an overestimation .",
    "this last result is easily explainable recalling that in ( [ orco ] ) we neglected a term in @xmath88 , for the sake of simplicity and computational feasibility , assuming that its main effect is simply to renormalize the @xmath49 constant @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneity strength @xmath78 is also important in determining the domain shape , as shown in figure [ figure3 ] ( c ) : increasing the inhomogeneity of the ff , the domain boundaries become more irregular .",
    "the @xmath78 value also determines the domain mobility under the influence of an external magnetic field , a large @xmath78 value results is a strong domain pinning with a very irregular and sudden domain motion , smaller @xmath78 values lead to a more smooth and continuous motion . for this reason",
    "the inhomogeneity strength can be estimated from the size distribution of the measured barkhausen avalanches @xcite .",
    "the two remaining material parameters @xmath9 and @xmath14 play no role in determining the domain characteristics , they simply define the absolute strength of the field and the absolute time scale for the domain motion respectively .",
    "this is explicitly shown in section [ us ] where ( [ orco ] ) is rescaled in order to be dimensionless , @xmath9 becomes the unit field while @xmath14 enters the unit time , ans both of them disappear from the rescaled equation .",
    "the possible experimental setups sketched in figure [ figure1 ] can be modeled by the idealized geometry of two plane interacting ffs of thickness @xmath89 and @xmath90 kept at a given distance @xmath91 , as sketched in figure [ figure4 ] .",
