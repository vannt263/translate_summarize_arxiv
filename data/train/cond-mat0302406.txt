    "superconductivity is a quantum state which appears at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath1 in various systems like e.g.  metals ( hg , pb ) , alloys ( nb@xmath2sn ) , copper oxides ( la - sr - cu - o , y - ba - cu-0 ) , exotic compounds ( mgb@xmath3 , uge@xmath3 , zrzn@xmath3 ) , the liquid @xmath4he , etc . depending on a material , @xmath5 can range from 10@xmath6 to more than hundred k and various underlying mechanisms could be responsible for superconductivity ( like the phonon or magnetically mediated attraction between electrons , the be condensation of tightly bound electron pairs , etc ) .",
    "one should add to this list a recently obtained superfluidity in the binary mixtures of the trapped alkali atoms such as : rubidium @xcite , potassium @xcite and lithium @xcite .",
    "transition temperatures @xmath7 nk became there experimentally accessible due to the `` resonance superfluidity '' .",
    "atoms of different hyperfine configuration are scattered from each other with a strength depending on the external magnetic field @xmath8 in a following way @xmath9 $ ] . near",
    "the resonance @xmath10 atoms experience a considerably amplified attractive interaction which gives rise to @xmath5 s comparable with the fermi temperature @xmath11 .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "such controlled way of adjusting the effective interactions between atoms is very appealing .",
    "it opens new possibilities to explore for instance such fundamental problems like a crossover from the weak coupling bcs superconductivity to the be superfluidity of tightly bound atom pairs . on a microscopic level ,",
    "the resonant type interactions are however rather delicate to treat ( for example near the resonance the usual perturbation theory can not be applied ) .",
    "so far , the most reasonable way of describing such interactions was proposed by timmermans @xcite in terms of the boson fermion ( bf ) model .",
    "this idea was recently intensively investigated by the jila group @xcite and independently by griffin and ohashi @xcite .",
    "alkali atoms of different hyperfine configurations are represented within the bf model via fermion fields which are characterized by a two labeled index , e.g.  @xmath12 .",
    "these fermions are assumed to interact with a boson field - bosons can be thought of as some bound molecules made of two atoms .",
    "according to the theory @xcite the resonant type interaction arises when a total energy of two colliding fermions matches the energy of boson state , the so called feshbach resonance @xcite .    using the bf model in the above mentioned context",
    "it was shown that transition temperature @xmath5 can become extremely high , of the order 0.2 @xmath11 for a uniform gas and about 0.5 @xmath11 in an isotropic harmonic trap @xcite . since the effective pairing potential modulates from weak to strong values the crossover study , along the lines of nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite was carried out @xcite clarifying such important issues like the collective modes , etc .",
    "it is worth to recall that the bf model has been known in the solid state physics for almost 20 years @xcite .",
    "it suits very well for studying superconductivity in systems with the arbitrary effective coupling strength .",
    "originally , the model was introduced @xcite for description of the electron - phonon system in a regime between the adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits . later on ,",
    "also the other possible relations were pointed out , e.g.  to : the periodic anderson model @xcite , the extended hubbard model @xcite , the 2d hubbard model in its strong interaction limit @xcite , and the @xmath13 model @xcite .",
    "there is a rich literature discussing properties of the superconducting and normal phases described by this model .",
    "many of such properties were experimentally observed in the high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) so the bf model is considered as a candidate for their description .    since it becomes very popular also for description of the trapped alkali atoms , we want to check in this short report if a resonant type scattering is really possible to be generated within the bf model .",
    "we shall prove that indeed , the boson fermion interaction may give rise to the effective resonant type scattering between fermions .",
    "this result is obtained by us via : 1 ) the standard canonical transformation and 2 ) using a continuous canonical transformation capable to trace the feedback effects @xcite .",
    "our study thus justifies applicability of the bf model for a description of the feshbach type interactions @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we consider here a model of free fermions coupled to the molecular boson field as described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath14 neglecting the fermion fermion interactions which eventually would be responsible for the _ background scattering _ @xcite .",
    "we use the second quantization operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 for the fermion state of energy @xmath17 which can exist in two possible hyperfine configurations symbolically denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 for the molecular boson state of energy @xmath21 .",
    "fermion and boson subsystems are coupled through the isotropic interaction @xmath22 ( in the context of htsc , it should be anisotropic @xcite ) . since a pair of fermions can `` dissociate '' into the boson state it implies that bosons are carrying the double fermions charge . in order to satisfy the charge conservation",
    "we introduce the common chemical potential @xmath23 and work in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "it is worthwhile to comment that within the bf model the mechanism of superconductivity is unconventional @xcite . due to interaction @xmath22 bosons",
    "acquire a well established effective mass @xmath24 , even if at the outset they are immobile ( @xmath25 ) . at a critical temperature @xmath26 bosons",
    "undergo the be condensation and simultaneously this triggers a superconducting ordering of the fermion subsystem @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "let us point out some of the unusual properties predicted theoretically on a basis of this bf scenario which are relevant for the htsc materials but could possibly manifest somehow also in the mixtures of the trapped alkali atoms .",
    "as far as superconducting phase is concerned : ( @xmath28 ) critical temperatures @xmath5 is known to become extremely high because the effective pairing potential [ on a level of the mean field theory estimated to be @xmath29 @xcite ] is very large in the , so called , mixed regime of coexisting fermion and boson particles @xcite which occurs when @xmath30 ) ; ( @xmath31 ) in the mixed regime , high values of @xmath5 are accompanied by the non - bcs ratio @xmath32 @xcite ; ( @xmath33 ) the upper critical field @xmath34 has a characteristic upward curvature @xmath35 @xcite . in the normal phase above @xmath5",
    "it was shown that : ( @xmath28 ) @xmath36 resistivity is linear with respect to @xmath37 up to very high temperatures @xcite , ( @xmath31 ) depending on a doping level and on temperature there is a change of sign of the hall constant @xcite , ( @xmath33 ) in a temperature regime @xmath38 the pseudogap ( partial depletion of the fermion density of states ) builds up near the fermi energy @xcite , ( @xmath39 ) the single particle spectrum reveals a clear particle - hole asymmetry @xcite .",
    "for studying effective physics of the bf model it is convenient first to apply the standard canonical transformation .",
    "we treat the boson fermion interaction as a perturbation @xmath40 and try to eliminate it from ( [ bf ] ) via the unitary transformation @xmath41 . choosing @xmath42 such that @xmath43=0 $ ] , we obtain the transformed hamiltonian @xmath44 as @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for other terms of the order @xmath47 .",
    "the renormalized quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 present in ( [ single_eff ] ) are given by @xmath51 \\label{eqn6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 , @xmath53 denoting the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distributions respectively . in the @xmath54 channel",
    "thus induced interaction between fermions of different @xmath55 simplifies to @xmath56 which explicitly exhibits a divergence .",
    "we notice that a scattering potential has a resonant type character when total energy of two colliding fermions is equal to the energy of boson field ( feshbach resonance @xcite ) .",
    "one may argue that validity of canonical transformation is limited only to such states which are far from the resonance because otherwise the operator ( [ s_canon ] ) is ill defined .",
    "our conclusion about the resonant scattering strength ( [ f_resonance ] ) may then seem questionable .",
    "however , in the next section we shall prove that such resonance is not an artifact , it indeed exists although somewhat smeared .",
    "instead of a single step transformation we will now disentangle the fermion from boson subsystems applying a sequence of infinitesimal transformations .",
    "the main idea behind is to proceed with a continuous canonical transformation @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 denotes some formal _ flow parameter _ which can vary between 0 and any other value ) until a given structure of the hamiltonian @xmath59 is obtained .",
    "a virtue of this method is that one can freely manipulate with @xmath57 in order to get a constrained structure of @xmath60 .    in this work",
    "we follow the algorithm outlined by wegner @xcite for constructing the generating operator @xmath61 of the continuous transformation .",
    "an arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath62 can be reduced to a semidiagonal structure by choosing @xmath63 $ ] which assures that @xmath64 . during the transformation",
    "@xmath65 part does evolve too , its @xmath58-dependent parameters have to be deduced from the general flow equation @xmath66 $ ] @xcite . in practice , this flow equation can never be identically satisfied because the higher and higher order interactions ( not present in @xmath67 ) are generated from the commutator . flow equation is often approximated by truncating the higher order interactions in a spirit of the perturbation theory , however the nonperturbative methods are in principle possible too @xcite .    in the previous work @xcite we have already formulated the continuous canonical transformation for the bf model .",
    "the corresponding flow equations ( 16 - 21 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite were derived within a perturbational estimation up to order @xmath47 . in this short report",
    "we want to study in some more detail the resonant - type interactions induced between fermions in the effective hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "in a course of transformation the interactions between fermions evolve from zero , at @xmath69 , to some effective value @xmath70 at @xmath71 when boson and fermion subsystems are finally decoupled from each other .",
    "_ flow _ of the potential is governed by the equation @xcite @xmath72   v_{{\\bf k},{\\bf p}}(l)v_{{\\bf q},{\\bf k}+{\\bf p}-{\\bf q}}(l )   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{ekflow }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these four @xmath58-dependent quantities @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 should be determined simultaneously .",
    "mathematically it is a tremendous task , nevertheless we shall estimate @xmath81 either in an approximate way or numerically and , in one special case , exactly .      some exact statements can be done for the superconducting / superfluid phase of the bf model . for temperatures",
    "@xmath37 smaller than a critical @xmath5 there exists a finite fraction of condensed bosons @xmath83 and chemical potential is then located at the lowest boson energy @xmath84 .",
    "the flow equation ( [ epsflow ] ) @xmath85 combined with ( [ hybrflow ] ) @xmath86 lead to the following invariance @xmath87 , where @xmath88 . in consequence , for the @xmath89 limit , we obtain the effective bogolubov type spectrum @xmath90 [ see eqn .  ( 52 ) of the ref .",
    "@xcite ] .    using the flow equation ( [ interflow ] )",
    "we find that , in the @xmath91 channel , potential @xmath80 is given by @xmath92 due to @xmath93 .",
    "after integration by parts we get from ( [ eqn12 ] ) @xmath94 because @xmath95 .",
    "since according to ( [ epsflow ] ) we have @xmath96 and from our previous estimation @xcite also @xmath97 we finally conclude @xmath98 this equation shows that two colliding electrons with total energy @xmath99 have a resonant - like scattering strength ( remember that in this case @xmath100 and due to symmetry @xmath101 ) .",
    "amplitude of the resonance is now finite and is controlled by the superconducting gap @xmath102 .",
    "effective interaction between fermions can be calculated approximately , for instance iteratively . in the first step we can neglect @xmath58-dependence of @xmath104 in the flow equations ( [ interflow ] ) and ( [ hybrflow ] )",
    "because fermion @xmath105 and boson energies @xmath106 are rather weakly renormalized during the transformation @xcite .    with an approximation @xmath107",
    "we can easily obtain @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "when further substituted to equation ( [ interflow ] ) we get the following asymptotic value @xmath109 @xmath110 which is less divergent than ( [ eqn6 ] ) .",
    "however , in the @xmath54 channel it again reduces to the resonant type potential given in ( [ f_resonance ] ) .",
    "divergence at @xmath111 occurs here because the flow equations ( [ interflow]- [ ekflow ] ) were not investigated fully selfconsistently .    in order to check , whether a selfconsistent treatment does not lead to any divergence we solved equations ( [ interflow]-[ekflow ] ) numerically by the runge kutta method . at the starting point @xmath69",
    ", we used the parabolic dispersions @xmath112 , @xmath113 and introduced the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath114 .",
    "we obtained the effective potential @xmath115 for several temperatures @xmath37 using a fixed total charge concentration @xmath116 .",
    "temperature had rather a negligible influence on a magnitude of the fermion fermion interaction for @xmath0 . using a given @xmath117 value we adjusted the total charge concentration so , that number of bosons @xmath118 and fermions @xmath119 were comparable .",
    "chemical potential was located very close to the bottom of boson states @xmath120 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the behavior of @xmath121 .",
    "again , we notice an appearance of the resonant type interaction for @xmath122 but , in distinction from ( [ f_resonance ] ) , amplitude of the resonance is finite .",
    "in summary , we analyzed the resonant type interactions between fermions ( experimentally achievable for example in the binary mixtures of @xmath123rb @xcite , @xmath124k @xcite or @xmath125li atoms @xcite in a presence of the magnetic field ) using the microscopic boson fermion ( bf ) model . within the bf scenario ,",
    "fermions are coupled to the boson field ( the long lived molecules composed of two atoms ) .",
    "this coupling is responsible for the many body effects and , in particular at @xmath5 it drives a system to the superconducting / superfluid ordering @xcite . when approaching the critical temperature from above , several precursor features can be observed which show that the pairing and the long range pair coherence may occur in this model at different temperatures @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "we determined the effective fermion fermion interaction induced by elimination of the boson fermion coupling via the canonical transformation .",
    "boson and fermion subsystems were disentangled ( i ) by the single step transformation , and ( ii ) through a continuous sequence of transformations taking account of the feedback effects @xcite . in both methods we obtained the effective resonant type interactions between fermions . at temperatures",
    "@xmath0 the resonance appeared to be more sharp ( although of finite amplitude ) , while for @xmath128 its amplitude reduced to a magnitude of the superconducting gap .    the resonant scattering seems to be a robust feature of the mixed boson - fermion system .",
    "it has an impact on several physical properties , for instance , it is responsible for the particle - hole asymmetric spectrum @xcite .",
    "other aspect which is important in a context of the soft matter physics is that the microscopic bf model can serve as a convenient tool for description of the resonant type interactions @xmath129 $ ] @xcite .",
    "many body effects can there be studied in a secure way ( though still far from trivial ) without a necessity to deal with any divergences .",
