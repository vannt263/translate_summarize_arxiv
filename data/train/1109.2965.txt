    "a group is _ left - orderable _ if it admits a strict total ordering which is invariant under left - multiplication .",
    "it is well known that any knot group or link group is left - orderable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , many classes of @xmath0-manifolds are known to have left - orderable fundamental groups .",
    "boyer , gordon and watson @xcite state a conjecture that an irreducible rational homology @xmath0-sphere is an @xmath1-space if and only if its fundamental group is not left - orderable . here ,",
    "an @xmath1-space is a rational homology sphere @xmath2 whose heegaard floer homology @xmath3 is a free abelian group of rank equal to @xmath4 , introduced by ozsvth and szab @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is verified for seifert fibered manifolds , sol manifolds , and double branched covers of non - split alternating links in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if a knot admits dehn surgery yielding an @xmath1-space , referred to as an @xmath1-space surgery , then there are some constraints for the knot .",
    "for example , its alexander polynomial has a specified form @xcite , and such knot must be fibered @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not going too far to say that most knots do not admit an @xmath1-space surgery .",
    "thus we can expect that any non - trivial dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot , which does not admit an @xmath1-space surgery , yields a @xmath0-manifold whose fundamental group is left - orderable .    in this direction , boyer , gordon and watson @xcite",
    "show that if @xmath5 is the figure - eight knot and @xmath6 , then @xmath7-surgery on @xmath5 yields a @xmath0-manifold with left - orderable fundamental group .",
    "furthermore , clay , lidman and watson @xcite show that this also holds for @xmath8 .",
    "( note that the figure - eight knot does not admit an @xmath1-space surgery . )    in this paper , we will examine the @xmath9-twist knot in the @xmath0-sphere , illustrated in figure [ fig : twistknot ] .",
    "we adopt the convention that the horizontal twists are right - handed if @xmath9 is positive , left - handed if @xmath9 is negative .",
    "thus , the @xmath10-twist knot is the figure - eight knot , and the @xmath11-twist knot is the right - handed trefoil . also , if @xmath12 , then the @xmath9-twist knot is hyperbolic and non - fibered ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to verify that @xmath13-surgery on the @xmath9-twist knot with @xmath12 yields a graph manifold whose fundamental group is left - orderable .",
    "since such a twist knot is non - fibered , it does not admits an @xmath1-space surgery .",

    "they make use of the dubrovina - dubrobin ordering for the braid group @xmath14 of order @xmath0 , which is isomorphic to the knot group of the trefoil , but we need some left - orderings for torus knot groups defined by navas @xcite .    by combining with known results , we can immediately prove the following .",

    "we can assume that @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath13-surgery on @xmath5 yields a toroidal manifold . in fact , the manifold is a graph manifold . in this section",
    ", we will examine the structure of the manifold by using the montesinos trick , and get a presentation of its fundamental group .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : montesinos ] , put @xmath5 in a symmetric position . by taking the quotient under the involution map",
    ", we have a tangle description of the knot exterior .",
    "this means that the double branched cover of the ( outside ) ball branched over the two strings recovers the knot exterior .",
    "if we fill the @xmath16-tangle , as indicated by dotted lines in figure [ fig : montesinos ] , into the inner ball , then it gives an unknot .",
    "here , we choose the framing so that the @xmath17-tangle filling corresponds to @xmath13-surgery .",
    "figure [ fig : montesinos2 ] shows the @xmath17-tangle filling yields a link with a trivial component .",
    "let @xmath18 be the @xmath19-sphere illustrated there which gives an essential tangle decomposition .",
    "one side of @xmath18 is the montesinos tangle @xmath20 , and the other side is the montesinos tangle @xmath21 .",
    "then the double branched cover @xmath22 of @xmath20 is the exterior of the torus knot of type @xmath23 , and the double cover @xmath24 of @xmath21 is the twisted @xmath25-bundle over the klein bottle .",
    "thus the resulting manifold @xmath2 of @xmath13-surgery on @xmath5 is @xmath26 .",

    "see figure [ fig : torusknot ] .",
    "the meridian @xmath28 is @xmath29 and the regular fiber @xmath30 with respect to a ( unique ) seifert fibration , is @xmath31 .",

    "then we can choose the generators @xmath32 of @xmath33 so that @xmath34 corresponds to an exceptional fiber in the first fibration , and @xmath35 corresponds to a regular fiber in the second fibration .",
    "thus we obtain that @xmath36 , and that @xmath37 is generated by @xmath38 and @xmath35 .    to get a presentation of @xmath39",
    ", we have to examine the identification between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    under the identification between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 on @xmath40",

    "consider two loops @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the boundary of the montesinos tangle @xmath21 as illustrated in figure [ fig : tangle ] .",
    "then @xmath44 and @xmath45 lift to two copies of @xmath38 and @xmath35 , respectively ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 12 ) ) .",
    "next , we replace the montesinos tangle @xmath21 with the @xmath17-tangle as shown in figure [ fig : identify ] , where we insert a narrow band @xmath46 to chase @xmath44 .",
    "the result is a trivial knot . by taking",
    "the double branched cover along this trivial knot , the band @xmath46 lifts to a knotted annulus , whose core forms the torus knot of type @xmath23 .",
    "( this proves that the double branched cover of @xmath20 is the exterior of the torus knot of type @xmath23 . ) also , the framing determined by @xmath46 has slope @xmath47 . recall that @xmath30 has slope @xmath48 .",
    "hence we can choose the orientations of @xmath34 and @xmath35 so that @xmath42 and @xmath38 correspond to the meridian @xmath28 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
