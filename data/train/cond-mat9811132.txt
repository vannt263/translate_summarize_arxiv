    "the oscillatory interlayer exchange coupling ( iec ) between magnetic layers separated by a non - magnetic spacer has recently attracted considerable attention in the literature . the physical origin of such oscillations",
    "is attributed to quantum interferences due to spin - dependent confinement of electrons in the spacer .",
    "the periods of the oscillations with respect to the spacer thickness are determined by the spacer fermi surface , and this conclusion has been confirmed by numerous experiments . in particular , the change of the fermi surface by alloying thus leads to the change of the oscillatory periods ( _ van schilfgaarde et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ; _ kudrnovsk et al .",
    ". on the other hand , there are very few studies of the temperature - dependence of the iec ( _ bruno _ , 1995 ; _",
    "dalbuquerque  e  castro et al . _ , 1996 ) , and its systematic study on _ ab initio _ level is missing .    the main mechanism of the temperature dependence of the iec is connected with thermal excitations of electron - hole pairs across the fermi level as described by the fermi - dirac function .",
    "it turns out that other mechanisms ( e.g. electron - phonon or electron - magnon interactions ) are less important .",
    "the effect of the temperature on the iec can be evaluated either analytically or numerically .",
    "the analytical approach assumes the limit of large spacer thicknesses , for which all the oscillatory contributions to the energy integral cancel out with exception of those at the fermi energy .",
    "the energy integral is then evaluated by a standard saddle - point method ( _ bruno _ , 1995 ) .",
    "the general functional form of the temperature - dependence of the interlayer exchange coupling @xmath2 in the limit of a single period is then : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 denotes the temperature , @xmath5 is the spacer thickness in monolayers , and @xmath6 is the constant which depends on the spacer fermi surface . the term @xmath7 exhibits a standard @xmath8-dependence ( _ bruno _ , 1995 ) , while the scaling temperature factor @xmath9 depends on @xmath5 via @xmath10 . in the preasymptotic regime ( small spacer thicknesses )",
    "the functional form of @xmath9 differs from that of eq .",
    "( [ eq_model ] ) , particularly in the case of the complete but relatively weak confinement due to the rapid variation of the phase of the integrand which enters the evaluation of the iec ( _ dalbuquerque e castro et al . _ , 1996 ) .",
    "the second , numerical approach is in principle exact , not limited to large spacer thicknesses , however , it may be numerically very demanding , in particular for low temperatures .",
    "it is applicable also to disordered systems with randomness in the spacer , magnetic layers , or at interfaces ( _ bruno et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "the multilayer system consists of the left and right magnetic subspaces separated by a non - magnetic spacer ( the trilayer ) .",
    "the spacer may be a random substitutional alloy .",
    "we employ the lloyd formulation of the iec combined with a spin - polarized surface green function technique as based on the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method .",
    "the exchange coupling energy @xmath2 can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi - dirac distribution function and @xmath13 is a difference of ( in the case of disorder , of configurationally averaged ) grandcanonical potentials for the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic alignments of magnetic slabs ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "the energy integration is performed over a contour @xmath14 along the real axis and closed by a large semicircle in the upper half of the complex energy plane , tr@xmath15 denotes the trace over angular momentum indices @xmath16 , the sum runs over @xmath17-vectors in the surface brillouin zone , and @xmath18 is the number of lattice sites in one layer . the quantity @xmath19 is expressed in terms of the screened structure constants which couple neighboring ( principal ) layers and of the so - called surface green functions .",
    "all details can be found in ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "we only note that the use of a green function formulation of the iec is essential for describing the randomness in the spacer within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) which is known to reproduce compositional trends in random alloys reliably .",
    "the integral in ( [ eq_iec ] ) can be recast into a more suitable form using the analytic properties of @xmath20 , namely , ( i ) @xmath20 is holomorphic in the upper complex halfplane , and ( ii ) @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "let us define a new function @xmath23 of a real variable @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "then at @xmath26 k , @xmath27 while at @xmath28 k , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath31 are matsubara energies @xmath32 . in the limit @xmath33 , @xmath34 continuously .",
    "we have verified that the function @xmath35 can be represented with a high accuracy as a sum of a few complex exponentials in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 are complex amplitudes and @xmath38 are complex wave numbers .",
    "an efficient method of finding the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 is described elsewhere ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) . the evaluation of @xmath39 is then straightforward : @xmath40 which for @xmath26 k gives @xmath41",
    "numerical studies were performed for an ideal fcc(001 ) layer stack of the spacer ( cu ) and magnetic ( co ) layers with the experimental lattice spacing of fcc cu .",
    "the spacer layers can contain the impurities ( zn , ni , and au ) which form the substitutional alloy with spacer atoms .",
    "possible lattice and layer relaxations are neglected .",
    "alloying with ni , zn , or au alters the electron concentration and , consequently , modifies the fermi surface and thus , in turn , also the temperature dependence of the iec .",
    "the most obvious effect of the alloying , for @xmath26 , is the change of the periods of oscillations connected with the change of the corresponding spanning vectors of the alloy fermi surface ( _ kudrnovsk et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "the more subtle effect of the alloying is connected with damping of electron states and relaxation of symmetry rules due to alloying .    to determine the parameters of complex exponentials ( [ dcexp ] ) , we have evaluated the function @xmath35 at 40 matsubara energies corresponding to @xmath42 k. we have verified that the results depend weakly on the actual value of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "special care was devoted to the brillouin zone integration .",
    "the efficiency of the present approach allows us to perform calculations with a large number of @xmath17-points in the irreducible part of the surface brillouin zone ( isbz ) .",
    "note also that such calculations have to be done only once and then the evaluation of the iec for any temperature is an easy task .",
    "in particular , we employ typically 40000 @xmath17-points in the isbz for the first matsubara energies close to the fermi energy and the number of @xmath17-points then progressively decreases for points distant from the real axis .",
    "the present calculations agree with the results of conventional calculations ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) but they are much more efficient numerically , in particular when calculations for many different temperatures are required",
    ".      the calculations were done for spacer thicknesses @xmath43 monolayers and for temperatures @xmath44  k ( in steps 10  k ) and by assuming semiinfinite co - slabs . in this case only one period , namely the so - called short - period exists , which simplifies the study .",
    "there are several possibilities of how to present results ( see _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) for more details ) . as an illustration , in fig .  1 we plot the discrete fourier transformations ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath5 , @xmath46 , as a function of variables @xmath47 and @xmath4 .",
    "the discrete fourier transformation on a subset @xmath48 which avoids the preasymptotic region is employed here .",
    "the positions of peaks of @xmath49 then determine oscillation periods @xmath50 , while @xmath51 give oscillation amplitudes ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , one can see how the modification of the fermi surface due to alloying changes the temperature dependence of the iec , i.e. , the coefficient @xmath6 in eq.([eq_model ] ) .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from numerical results : ( i ) the non - random case ( cu ) exhibits the period @xmath52  mls ( monolayers ) or , equivalently , @xmath53 in accordance with previous calculations ( _ drchal et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) . in accordance with ( _ kudrnovsk et al",
    "_ , 1996 ) , the periods of oscillations for cu@xmath54zn@xmath55 alloy are shifted towards higher periods @xmath56 , towards smaller periods for cu@xmath57ni@xmath58 alloy @xmath59 , while they remain almost unchanged for equiconcentration cuau alloy spacer @xmath60   mls ) ; ( ii ) the periods of oscillations are temperature independent because the electronic structure or , alternatively , spanning vectors are temperature independent ; ( iii ) the amplitudes exhibit a strong temperature dependence in agreement with predictions of model theories ( _ bruno _ , 1995 ) . in particular , our results agree reasonably well with those of fig .  3 in ( _ dalbuquerque e castro et al . _ , 1996 ) for the case of ideal cu spacer .",
    "( iv ) for alloy spacers at @xmath26 we mention , in particular , the dependence @xmath8 of the oscillation amplitudes on the spacer thickness @xmath5 for cuni and cuau alloy spacers , while additional exponential damping due to disorder was found for the cuzn alloy .",
    "this indicates a finite lifetime of states at the fermi energy for @xmath17-vectors corresponding to short - period oscillations for this case and only a weak damping for cuau and cuni alloys ; ( v ) finally , the effect of temperature ( the factor @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_model ] ) ) is similar for a pure cu - spacer , cuni and cuau alloys , but it is much smaller for the case of cuzn alloys .",
    "the effect of temperature , similarly to alloying , is to broaden spanning vectors of the fermi surface ( _ bruno _ , 1995 ) .",
    "if the damping due to alloying is non - negligible , the combined effect of disorder and temperature leads to a relatively smaller ( compared to the case @xmath610  k ) suppression of the oscillation amplitude with the temperature .",
