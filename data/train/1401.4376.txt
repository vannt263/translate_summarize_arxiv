    "the well - known mg@xmath0 ( @xmath1 si , ge , sn ) thermoelectric compounds @xcite and their alloys @xcite have attracted renewed attention  @xcite as they are composed of abundant , low - cost ( except germanium ) and relatively non - toxic elements .",
    "these compounds exhibit large seebeck coefficient ( @xmath12 ) , quite high electrical conductivity ( @xmath13 ) and low thermal conductivity ( @xmath14 ) , yielding high efficiency of thermoelectric ( te ) conversion , which is commonly captured in the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "the fact that some of these materials have @xmath17 in the mid - temperature range ( 400 - 800 k ) and the lowest density amongst all efficient thermoelectrics  @xcite , may prove to be decisive for ground transportation and space applications of these materials @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath11type mg@xmath6si@xmath18sn@xmath19 solid solutions have been found to be the most favorable in terms of te energy conversion as they have the lowest thermal conductivity due to the maximum mass difference between its components and quite large effective mass of carriers @xcite .",
    "it was reported that more complex quasi - quaternary solid solutions mg@xmath6si@xmath20sn@xmath19ge@xmath21 exhibited even better te performance upon @xmath11type doping ( @xmath22)@xcite . conversely , @xmath7type mg@xmath6si - based materials show markedly poorer te performance ( @xmath23 ) and there are only few impurities ( ga@xcite or ag@xcite ) which allow to turn these systems to the hole - like electrical conductivity and positive thermopower .    in order to elucidate unusual electron transport properties of mg@xmath6(si - ge - sn ) thermoelectrics , _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations have been recently reported@xcite .",
    "they mostly focused on so - called convergence of two conduction bands @xcite , which appeared near x point in the brillouin zone of mg@xmath6si@xmath18sn@xmath19 for @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , this electronic structure feature , expected to be responsible for overall enhancement of te properties of these compounds , was supported by computations of relevant transport coefficients within the boltzmann transport theory@xcite , but neglecting relativistic effects .",
    "we will show that the s - o interaction is crucial to reliably interpret especially @xmath7type materials .",
    "other theoretical works attempted to search for efficient @xmath11 and @xmath7 dopants to allow tuning and optimizing te properties of these materials @xcite .",
    "this work presents results of the first principles calculations performed by fully relativistic and semi relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) methods combined with the boltzmann transport approach to calculate thermopower in function of temperature and carrier concentration .",
    "we show that the s - o interaction strongly affects top valence bands near @xmath2 point ( best seen in mg@xmath6sn ) and the calculated values of the s - o splitting remain in good agreement with available experimental data . on the whole ,",
    "the s - o coupling has a detrimental effect on @xmath7type thermopower even at elevated temperature ( 300 - 400 k ) and near optimal carrier concentration ( @xmath25 @xmath10 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of the s - o coupling on conduction bands in @xmath11type mg@xmath0 is negligible whatever temperature and carrier concentration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "key formulas connecting the electronic band structure obtained from korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method and the electron transport coefficients studied within the boltzmann approach , as well as computational details are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : details ] .",
    "[ sec : results ] presents our results containing mainly ( i ) an analysis of the hole - like and electron - like fermi surface shapes , ( ii ) a determination of effective mass of carriers using a simple and efficient procedure , ( iii ) a discussion of seebeck coefficient vs. temperature and concentration . all results derived from semi - relativistic and fully relativistic kkr calculations are compared in systematic way .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the full potential kkr@xcite method based on the green s function multiple scattering theory was implemented to calculate electronic band structure .",
    "the reduction of the dirac equation to the so - called semi - relativistic ( sr ) version was done with adopting technique developed by koelling and harmon@xcite and extended by ebert@xcite . with this procedure",
    "the resulting set of coupled radial equation after dropping the spin - orbit interaction are similar to the non - relativistic one , but retains all other kinematic effects such as mass - velocity , darwin contribution and higher order terms . the full relativistic ( fr ) method",
    "was done by directly solving the four component dirac equation without any simplification .",
    "this allows to calculate band structure with or without s - o interaction , showing its influence directly .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed with previously presented details@xcite .",
    "as already discussed in literature  @xcite , lda ( and gga as well ) tends to underestimate band gaps also in mg@xmath0 compounds . in recent",
    "works@xcite it was shown that the application of the modified becke - johnson semi - local exchange potential of tran and blaha @xcite yielded the gap values close to the experimental ones but without important changes in shape of bands .",
    "thus , in this work , the standard lda ( with the perdew and wang@xcite formula for exchange - correlation potential ) is employed in kkr calculations and the energy gaps are expanded to experimental values@xcite ( see , table  [ table : tab1_1 ] ) to allow for reasonable discussion of transport properties in function of temperature .",
    "the boltzmann transport theory , which can successfully connect atomic level properties of materials with the macroscopic transport coefficients@xcite is used for calculation of thermopower . within this",
    "approach@xcite the seebeck coefficient can be expressed as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 @xmath28 is an energy - dependent conductivity , commonly called the transport function ( tf ) .",
    "chemical potential @xmath29 depends on temperature @xmath30 and doping ( @xmath31 ) , where an extra carrier concentration @xmath31 can be positive ( @xmath11type doping , e.g. sb or bi in mg@xmath0 ) or negative ( @xmath7type doping , e.g. ga in some mg@xmath6(si - ge ) alloys@xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "the rigid band model@xcite is used to mimic @xmath11 and @xmath7type behaviors , which allows to focus on the s - o effect on charge carrier transport in case of electron - like and hole - like doping , respectively .",
    "the transport function , within the relaxation time approximation , has the form of the @xmath32-space integral over @xmath33 electronic bands : @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electron relaxation time and @xmath36 denotes the electron velocity . representing the band structure as isoenergetic surfaces@xcite ( @xmath37 ) and employing the commonly used constant relaxation time approximation ( @xmath38 )",
    "allow to convert tf into the form more convenient for numerical computation : @xmath39 it is worth mentioning that upon substituting eq .",
    "[ eq : sig ] into eqs .",
    "[ eq : sigmaall ] and [ eq : s ] , @xmath40 cancels out so that thermopower is independent of @xmath40 in the constant relaxation time approximation .    in a similar way ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) function can be calculated @xmath41 and such representation enables to decompose the dos ( and also tf ) into contributions from each @xmath33-th band .    to facilitate the discussion of the seebeck coefficient , the effect of the s - o interaction on the effective mass is investigated .",
    "accordingly , we propose a simple and efficient way of calculating the energy dependent effective mass . dos effective mass is defined for the parabolic band @xmath42 through the formula : @xmath43 to generalize this concept to any other , non - parabolic case , the effective mass becomes energy ( or carrier concentration ) dependent @xmath44 .",
    "the effective mass can be extracted from the dos formula and combined with its energy derivative @xmath45{\\pi^4g(\\mathscr{e})g'(\\mathscr{e})},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 denotes free electron mass .    in this way , the dimensionless dos effective mass ( @xmath5 ) can be found at every energy point , at which dos was calculated .",
    "this approach can also be seen as fitting the effective mass with the parabolic band at every @xmath47 and @xmath32-points separately and then averaging over isoenergy surface @xmath48 .",
    "practically , the computation of @xmath5 using this scheme requires highly accurate dos function to avoid problems with numerical noise appearing when differentiating . here",
    ", dos is calculated with @xmath49  mev energy resolution , and @xmath50 resulting from eq .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the results of the boltzmann transport and kkr calculations are consistent with intuitive predictions based on the aforementioned analysis of the band splitting and effective mass changes .",
    "first of all , for the three mg@xmath0 compounds there is no significant difference between thermopower from fr and sr calculations in the @xmath11type materials for high concentration and low temperature .",
    "the reason is simply the negligible differences between conduction bands induced by the s - o interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference between fr and sr appearing for lower carrier concentration and higher temperature comes from the bipolar effect , which accounts for contribution from valence bands , that are apparently different from the fr and sr results .",
    "the bipolar reduction of the absolute value of @xmath11type @xmath12 is highest for mg@xmath6sn , where the band gap is the smallest . in fully relativistic kkr calculations",
    "seebeck coefficient is less reduced , because of the lower effective mass of holes .    for hole - like thermopower , the splitting of the bands accompanied by the reduction of the effective mass significantly decrease the seebeck coefficient in mg@xmath6ge and mg@xmath6sn for @xmath53 @xmath10 in the low and mid - temperature range",
    "( see also tab .",
    "[ table : tab2 ] ) . for mg@xmath6sn , the s - o effect can lower thermopower even twice , showing that it is crucial for the discussion of the te properties of @xmath7type mg@xmath0 systems . at high temperature , due to the temperature blurring of dos ( convoluted with fermi - dirac function ) ,",
    "the main contribution to thermopower comes from the lower - lying parts of dispersion curves , where computed band curvature from fr and sr approaches , are similar . also , at high temperature the importance of the so band splitting diminishes , which effectively lowers the difference between sr and fr computations .",
    "similar trend is apparently observed when the carrier concentration increases and the fermi level moves deeper into the valence bands and almost no difference between sr and fr results is observed for @xmath54 @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , fr kkr calculations show that in @xmath7type mg@xmath6si both @xmath5 and @xmath12 values are in principle higher than the values from the sr computations .",
    "the slightly reduced @xmath12 is seen only in very low concentration and temperature , where the small area of fs near @xmath2 point are taken into consideration in electron transport . in this case , i.e. @xmath55 , the band curvature modification as well as the s - o splitting , seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig : bands4 ] , leads to the decrease of @xmath5 , and therefore to small decrease of @xmath12 ( see fig  [ fig : tp1 ] at @xmath56  k and small hole concentration @xmath57 ) . for @xmath58 ,",
    "these effects are no longer important . at higher temperature",
    "the s - o splitting is too small and additionally smeared by temperature , i.e. @xmath59  mev @xmath60 for @xmath61  k , that it does not alter results from transport function integration ( eq .  [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "the results of the electronic band structure calculations with the use of fully relativistic ( fr ) vs. semi - relativistic ( sr ) full potential kkr method for the mg@xmath0 ( @xmath1  si , ge and sn ) compounds were reported .",
    "it was found that the s - o interaction splits the valence band structure , with the s - o splitting at @xmath2 point , namely 36 mev , 208 mev and 525 mev , well corresponding to experimental data@xcite 30 mev , 200 mev and 480 mev ( or 600 mev ) in mg@xmath6si , mg@xmath6ge and mg@xmath6sn , respectively .",
    "the s - o splitting itself , as well as modification in dispersion relation ( even more important ) of top valence bands , i.e. heavy and light hole bands , significantly decreased the effective mass and the seebeck coefficient . in mg@xmath6ge and mg@xmath6sn ,",
    "the analysis of the energy dependent dos effective mass shows that the s - o interaction lowers @xmath5 of holes , and the effect is larger near the valence band edge and for the heaviest compound .",
    "in general , this leads to the reduction of the @xmath7type thermopower , mostly at lower concentration and low or medium range of temperature .",
    "the thermopower decrease becomes more serious with increasing atomic number of @xmath3 element , reaching the magnitude of @xmath62 in mg@xmath6sn . on the whole",
    ", our kkr calculations combined with boltzmann transport approach clearly show that the relativistic effects are detrimental for thermoelectric performance in @xmath7doped mg@xmath6ge and mg@xmath6sn .",
    "in mg@xmath6si , the s - o interaction slightly increases the effective hole mass , except for the low carrier concentration range .",
    "this behavior leads to the small increase of thermopower ( up to 10% ) for @xmath63  @xmath10 .    in turn ,",
    "the s - o coupling effect on the conduction bands is negligible in all mg@xmath0 compounds .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath11type thermopower at lower carrier concentrations benefits from the degradation of the @xmath7type @xmath12 due to the reduction of the bipolar effect , which is well seen in mg@xmath6ge and mg@xmath6sn compounds .    in summary , the full relativistic kkr results revealed that the spin - orbit interaction is significant factor decreasing the thermoelectric performance of @xmath7type mg@xmath0 ( especially mg@xmath6sn ) .",
    "they also enlightened the reason why in mg@xmath6(si - ge - sn ) system the measured @xmath64 in @xmath7doped samples was much lower ( @xmath65)@xcite than the values gained in @xmath11doped materials ( @xmath22)@xcite .",
