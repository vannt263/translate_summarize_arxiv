    "<S> we then show that the joint measurability region of quantum theory is contained in the joint measurability region of any other probabilistic theory .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum theory has a number of important features not known in classical physics , ranging from the superposition and indeterminacy principles formulated by the pioneers to the more recently discovered no - cloning and no - broadcasting theorems . </S>",
    "<S> it is an old problem to identify operationally significant properties of quantum theory that distinguish it from other probabilistic theories . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> many features have been under intensive investigation from this perspective , including information processing @xcite , optimal state discrimination @xcite , entropy @xcite , purification @xcite and discord @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that some properties are quite generally valid in any non - classical ( no - signaling ) probabilistic theories while others are specifically quantum .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of pairs of incompatible observables marks one of the most striking distinctions between quantum theory and classical physical theories . </S>",
    "<S> there are many manifestations of incompatibility , perhaps the most famous being the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that quantum theory contains observables that are as incompatible ( in a sense to be defined ) as observables in any probabilistic theory can be .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim is thus to compare quantum theory to other possible probabilistic physical theories . </S>",
    "<S> we first need to set some minimal constraints . </S>",
    "<S> a probabilistic theory is a framework that provides a description of physical systems in terms of states and observables with the following general properties : +   + ( i ) the states of a system are represented by the elements of a convex subset of a real vector space . + ( ii ) an observable is represented as an affine mapping from the set of states into the set of probability distributions on some outcome space . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves here to observables with a finite or countable number of outcomes . + ( iii ) any affine mapping from the set of states into the set of probability distributions is a valid observable . + we consider a particular probabilistic theory ( pt ) as given by a family of convex sets of states with associated sets of observables that share some properties specific to that pt </S>",
    "<S> . one may think of each pair consisting of a set of states with associated set of observables as an _ instance _ of a pt representing a particular type of physical system .    </S>",
    "<S> given a pt , we denote by @xmath0 the probability of obtaining a measurement outcome @xmath1 when an observable @xmath2 is measured in a state @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we will typically label the measurement outcomes by integers .    </S>",
    "<S> in quantum theory the states are described by density operators and observables correspond to povms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their duality is given by the trace formula ( with @xmath3 a density operator and @xmath6 a povm ) @xmath7 } \\ , .\\ ] ]    another example of a probabilistic theory is a classical theory , where the states are probability measures on a phase space @xmath8 and observables are traditionally represented as functions @xmath9 ; the associated affine maps from states @xmath3 to probability distributions are then given by the formula @xmath10    continuing our discussion on general probabilistic theories , we note that it follows from the required properties ( i)-(iii ) that the set of observables is a convex set ; a mixture of two observables is an observable . </S>",
    "<S> physically mixing corresponds to an experiment where we switch between two measurement apparatuses with a random probability . </S>",
    "<S> we can directly write a mixture of two observables with the same set of measurement outcomes . if the sets of measurement outcomes differ , we can still write a mixture by first adding enough outcomes and then embedding both sets into @xmath11 .    another consequence of the basic requirements is that every constant mapping @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a fixed probability distribution , is an observable and we call it a _ trivial observable_. a trivial observable @xmath14 corresponds to a dice rolling experiment , where we randomly pick the measurement outcome according to a given fixed probability distribution , without manipulating the state at all . in quantum theory , trivial observables are described by povms @xmath15 such that each operator @xmath16 is a multiple of the identity operator , i.e. , @xmath17 for some @xmath18 with @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of _ joint measurement _ can be defined in any probabilistic theory . </S>",
    "<S> two observables @xmath20 and @xmath21 are _ jointly measurable _ if there exists an observable @xmath2 such that @xmath22 in this case @xmath2 is called a _ joint observable _ of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not jointly measurable , then we say that they are _ </S>",
    "<S> incompatible_.    </S>",
    "<S> any probabilistic theory contains jointly measurable pairs of observables . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a trivial observable @xmath12 is jointly measurable with any other observable ; we can write a joint observable @xmath23 for the trivial observable and any other observable @xmath20 . this simply corresponds to an experiment where we measure @xmath20 and simultaneously roll a dice . </S>",
    "<S> it is a well known fact that , in quantum theory , an observable which is jointly measurable with all other observables is necessarily a trivial observable . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , any povm element of such an observable commutes with all projections and must therefore be a scalar multiple of the identity ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> then @xmath25 and @xmath26 are jointly measurable for any choice of trivial observables @xmath27 and @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> .    this proposition can be proved with the following construction . </S>",
    "<S> first , let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the probability distributions related to @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we define an observable @xmath2 by formula @xmath31 for a fixed @xmath3 , the right hand side is clearly a probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the right hand side is an affine mapping on @xmath3 ; therefore @xmath2 is an observable . </S>",
    "<S> the marginal observables are @xmath32 this proves prop . </S>",
    "<S> [ prop : sum=1 ] .    the physical idea behind this construction is the following . </S>",
    "<S> in each measurement run we flip a coin and , depending on the result , we measure either @xmath20 or @xmath21 in the input state @xmath3 . in this way we get a measurement outcome for either @xmath20 or @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , we roll a dice and pretend that this is a measurement outcome for the other observable . in this way we get an outcome for both observables simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the overall observable is the one given in formula .    for two observables @xmath20 and @xmath21 , </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath33 the set of all points @xmath34\\times[0,1]$ ] for which there exist trivial observables @xmath35 such that @xmath25 and @xmath36 are jointly measurable , and we call @xmath33 the _ joint measurability region _ of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the joint measurability region thus characterizes how much noise ( in terms of trivial observables ) we need to add to be able to have a joint realization of @xmath20 and @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> . clearly , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are jointly measurable if and only if @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> the joint measurability region @xmath33 is a convex region which can be plotted in the plane . </S>",

    "<S> in other words , we will show that two orthogonal spin observables are as incompatible as any binary observables can be .    to this end , let us note that two binary quantum observables are incompatible if and only if they enable a violation of the bell - chsh inequality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we must therefore look at the bell expression @xmath92 let us denote @xmath93 and @xmath94 . using , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) one verifies that by varying the observables @xmath95 and @xmath96 and the bipartite state the numbers @xmath97 and @xmath98 obtain all of the values from the disc @xmath99 . </S>",

    "<S> given any pair of binary observables @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and weights @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath113 , the mixtures @xmath114 and @xmath115 can not be used to violate the bell - cshs inequality and must therefore be jointly measurable . </S>",

    "<S> . we can again ask if this is a necessary trick in order to reach the conclusion @xmath64 . since </S>",
    "<S> two mutually unbiased bases are expected to be among the most incompatible observables in a fixed dimension @xmath75 , our construction suggests that the conclusion @xmath117 can be reached only if one considers arbitrarily high dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> a proof of this fact is , however , lacking .    </S>",
    "<S> we show finally that the conclusion @xmath117 can be reached by using a _ single pair _ of incompatible observables if we consider an infinite dimensional system and observables with infinite number of outcomes .    </S>",

    "<S> this implies that for any projection @xmath135 on @xmath118 , the projected observables @xmath136 and @xmath137 acting on a subspace @xmath138 are jointly measurable . </S>",

    "<S> especially , the projections of @xmath133 and @xmath134 to any subspace @xmath79 should be jointly measurable . </S>",
    "<S> but from the result cited in the proof of theorem [ th : main ] we know that for @xmath75 large enough , the projections to @xmath79 are incompatible . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are incompatible .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the observables @xmath125 and @xmath126 defined in are not the only pair that satisfy @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we can modify @xmath125 and @xmath126 in any chosen subspace @xmath79 but the conclusion @xmath128 is still true since it depends on the fact that @xmath125 and @xmath126 contain mutually unbiased bases in arbitrarily high dimension . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question within quantum theory is to find a characterization of all pairs of quantum observables @xmath140 that satisfy @xmath143 . </S>",
