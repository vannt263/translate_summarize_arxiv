    "until a few years ago , it was not possible to directly determine the fundamental properties of even the closest dwarf stars .",
    "the advent of _ hipparcos _ has greatly improved the situation , allowing to accurately determine the surface gravities of nearby dwarfs .",
    "the situation is much worse for the effective temperatures ( t@xmath0 ) of unevolved stars , due to sub - milli - arcsec level angular diameters ( a few mas for the closest dwarfs ) .",
    "fortunately , the stellar diameters of about a dozen dwarfs are now available , mostly from vlti interferometric measurements ( kervella et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "ramrez & melndez ( 2004 , 205a ) have shown that the infrared flux method ( irfm ) t@xmath0 scale is in excellent agreement with measured stellar diameters of 10 fgk dwarfs in the metallicity range -0.5 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 + 0.3 dex .",
    "however , the temperatures obtained from spectroscopic equilibrium of iron lines seem to be in conflict with the ones derived from the irfm . the temperatures of metal - rich dwarfs with planets may be being overestimated by about 110 k when the temperatures are determined from excitation equilibrium of fei lines ( see ramrez & melndez 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "this is not restricted to star with planets , since analysis of other samples results in similar discrepancies .",
    "for example , the fei temperatures of thin- and thick - disk dwarf stars analyzed by bensby et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are also about 110 k hotter than irfm temperatures ( ramrez & melndez 2005a ) .",
    "the source of the problem is still not clear .",
    "the culprit is probably the neglect of nlte effects , but errors in atomic data are not discarded , as well as granulation effects . in this work",
    "we analyze a sample of nearby metal - rich dwarfs from the s@xmath2n database ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2004 ) , which are closer than 15 pc , therefore with extremely small errors in their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes , imposing stringent constraint on their surface gravities ( @xmath1 0.01 dex ) , allowing thus to check the validity of spectroscopic gravities .",
    "furthermore , the irfm temperature scale is used to check the excitation temperatures determined from a 1d lte analysis .",
    "the sample stars were selected from the s@xmath2n database , and they cover the atmospheric parameters space 5000 k @xmath1 t@xmath0 @xmath1 6600 k , 4.0 @xmath1 log @xmath3 @xmath1 4.6 , @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 + 0.5 .",
    "twenty five stars with relatively clean line profiles were selected .",
    "the temperature was determined employing the irfm t@xmath0 scale ( ramrez & melndez 2005a , b ) and surface gravities are from _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .",
    "we will refer to these atmospheric parameters as `` physical '' parameters .",
    "the choice of atomic data is critical , since systematic errors in the @xmath5-values could lead to wrongly - determined atmospheric parameters . for fei lines ,",
    "the @xmath5-values were taken from the oxford ( blackwell et al .",
    "1995a and references therein ) and hannover ( bard et al .",
    "1991 , bard & kock 1994 ) groups .",
    "the collisional broadening constants were taken from barklem et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "it has been discussed in the literature the lack of accurate experimental @xmath5-values for feii lines , and the importance of improving laboratory measurements for accurate stellar abundance work ( e.g. lambert et al .",
    "1996 , gehren et al .",
    "the bulk of laboratory measurements are probably correct in an absolute scale , but there are large uncertainties in a line - by - line basis .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical _ relative _ line intensities within a given multiplet are highly reliable , but the absolute scale is not .",
    "melndez & barbuy ( 2002 ) have taken advantage of both methods , with relative @xmath5-values obtained from theoretical calculations and the absolute transition probabilities for each multiplet were normalized with laboratory measurements .",
    "melndez & barbuy ( 2005 , in preparation ) have updated their previous work with new laboratory and theoretical works .",
    "this improved list of feii lines is used in the present work .",
    "iron abundances were obtained from fei and feii lines , employing the program moog ( sneden 1973 ) and kurucz model atmospheres .",
    "first , iron abundances were determined from the physical parameters ( irfm + hipparcos ) , then lte spectroscopic equilibrium was imposed to obtain spectroscopic temperatures and gravities , enforcing simultaneously @xmath6 = 0.000 @xmath7 0.002 dex / ev ( excitation equilibrium ) and @xmath8 ( ionization equilibrium ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 , where the difference between physical and spectroscopic parameters ( @xmath9 t@xmath0 , @xmath9 log @xmath3 ) are plotted as a function of t@xmath0 and log @xmath3 . as can be seen , we succeed to bring into rough agreement the temperatures determined from the irfm and excitation equilibrium of fei lines",
    ". however , ionization equilibrium is not satisfied , and spectroscopic gravities could be off by as much as 0.4 dex , which is much higher than the uncertainties expected from _",
    "hipparcos _ parallaxes ( @xmath1 0.01 dex ) or errors in masses and bolometric corrections ( a few 0.01 dex ) .    in the lower panel",
    "we show a plot of @xmath9 log @xmath3 vs. @xmath9 t@xmath0 .",
    "if spectroscopic equilibrium is fulfilled in a lte 1d analysis , ( @xmath9 log @xmath3 , @xmath9 t@xmath0 ) are expected to be distributed randomly inside an ellipse with semi - axis about 50 k in t@xmath0 and 0.05 dex in log @xmath3 , centered in ( 0 , 0 ) ( provided the physical atmospheric parameters are correct in an absolute scale ) .",
    "more conservatively , we considered that if spectroscopic parameters are correct they should satisfy : ( @xmath9 t@xmath0 /75 k)@xmath10 + ( @xmath9 log @xmath3/0.075 dex)@xmath10 @xmath1 1 .",
    "however , even considering these very generous errors , there are no points inside the expected region ( fig .",
    "1 , lower panel ) , and a strong correlation between the errors in spectroscopic t@xmath0 and log @xmath3 is observed , showing that spectroscopic atmospheric parameters are not independent . note that this can not be solved by invoking large errors in the absolute scale of @xmath5-values of feii lines , since those errors would affect the zero point of @xmath9 log @xmath3 , but not both the unacceptable large range in error ( about 0.4 dex ) and the correlation between @xmath9 log @xmath3 and @xmath9 t@xmath0 .",
    "classical lte 1d modeling may be failing to satisfy spectroscopic equilibrium of iron lines , and the atmospheric parameters estimated from this assumption may be wrong . since feii is the main ionization stage in g and f dwarfs and it is expected to be formed in lte , the problem is probably due to nlte effects on fei lines .",
    "considering nlte on line formation of fei lines results in a higher iron abundance than that derived from a lte approach ( e.g. shchukina & trujillo bueno 2001 ) , thus lowering the discrepancy observed between spectroscopic and _ hipparcos _ gravities ."
