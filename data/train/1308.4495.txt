    "this paper is the first of three devoted to bilattices , the other two being @xcite . taken together ,",
    "our three papers provide a systematic treatment of dual representations via natural duality theory , showing that this theory applies in a uniform way to a range of varieties having bilattice structure as a unifying theme .",
    "the representations are based on hom - functors and hence the constructions are inherently functorial . the key theorems on which we call are easy to apply , in black - box fashion , without the need to delve into the theory .",
    "almost all of the natural duality theory we employ can , if desired , be found in the text by clark and davey  @xcite .",
    "the term bilattice , loosely , refers to a set @xmath0 equipped with two lattice orders , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , subject to some compatibility requirement .",
    "the subscripts have the following connotations : @xmath3 measuring ` degree of truth ' and @xmath4 ` degree of knowledge ' . as an algebraic structure , then , a bilattice carries two pairs of lattice operations : @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the term distributive is applied when all possible distributive laws hold amongst these four operations ; distributivity imposes strictly stronger compatibility between the two lattice structures than the condition known as interlacing .",
    "distributive bilattices may be , but need not be , also assumed to have universal bounds for each order which are treated as distinguished constants ( or , in algebraic terms , as nullary operations ) .",
    "in addition , a bilattice is often , but not always , assumed to carry in addition an involutory unary operation @xmath9 , thought of as modelling a negation .",
    "historically , the investigation of bilattices ( of all types ) has been tightly bound up with their potential role as models in artificial intelligence and with the study of associated logics .",
    "we note , by way of a sample , the pioneering papers of ginsberg @xcite and belnap @xcite and the more recent works @xcite .",
    "we do not , except to a very limited extent in section  [ sec : conclude ] , address logical aspects of bilattices in our work .",
    "in this paper we focus on distributive bilattices , with or without bounds and with or without negation . in @xcite we consider varieties arising as expansions of those considered here , in particular distributive bilattices with both negation and a conflation operation .",
    "in @xcite we move outside the realm of distributivity , and even outside the wider realm of interlaced bilattices , and study certain quasivarieties generated by finite non - interlaced bilattices arising in connection with default logics .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : dbilat ] formally introduces the varieties we shall study and establishes some basic properties .",
    "sections  [ sec : db ] ,  [ sec : dbu ] and [ sec : dpb ] present our natural dualities for these varieties .",
    "we preface these sections by accounts of the relevant natural duality theory , tailored to our intended applications ( sections  [ piggyonesorted ] and  [ sec : multi ] ) .",
    "theory and practice are brought together in sections  [ sec : dispiggydual ] and  [ sec : prodrep ] , in which we demonstrate how our representation theory relates to , and illuminates , results in the existing literature .",
    "section  [ sec : applications ] is devoted to applications : we exploit our natural dualities to establish a range of properties of bilattices which are categorical in nature , for instance the determination of free objects and of unification  type .",
    "we emphasise that our approach differs in an important respect from that adopted by other authors .",
    "bilattices have been very thoroughly studied as algebraic structures ( see for example  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "central to the theory of distributive bilattices , and more generally interlaced ones , is the theorem showing that such algebras can always be represented as products of pairs of lattices , with the structure determined from the factors ( see @xcite and @xcite for the bounded and unbounded cases , respectively , and the informative historical survey by davey @xcite of the evolution of this oft - rediscovered result ) .",
    "the product representation is normally derived by performing quite extensive algebraic calculations .",
    "it is then used in a crucial way to obtain , for those bilattice varieties which have bounded distributive lattice reducts , dual representations which are based on priestley duality @xcite .",
    "our starting point is different . for each class @xmath10 of algebras",
    "we study here and in @xcite , we first establish , by elementary arguments , that @xmath10 takes the form @xmath11 , where  @xmath12 is finite , or , more rarely , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a set of two finite algebras .",
    "( in @xcite we assume at the outset that @xmath10 is the quasivariety generated by some finite algebra in which we are interested . ) this gives us direct access to the natural duality framework . from this perspective",
    ", the product representation is a consequence of the natural dual representation , and closely related to it . for a reconciliation , in the distributive setting , of our approach and that of others and an explanation of how these approaches differ , see sections  [ sec : prodrep ] and  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we may summarise as follows what we achieve in this paper and in @xcite .",
    "for different varieties we call on different versions of the theory of natural dualities .",
    "accordingly our account can , _",
    "inter alia _ , be read as a set of illustrated tutorials on the natural duality methodology presented in a self - contained way .",
    "the examples we give will also be new to natural duality aficionados , but for such readers we anticipate that the primary interest of our work will be its contribution to the understanding of the interrelationship between natural and priestley - style dualities for finitely generated quasivarieties of distributive lattice - based algebras . for this",
    "we exploit the piggybacking technique , building on work initiated in our paper @xcite and our constructions elucidate precisely how product representations come about .",
    "all our natural dual representations are new , as are our priestley - style dual representations in the unbounded cases .",
    "finally we draw attention to the remarks with which we end the paper drawing parallels between the special role the knowledge order plays in our theory and the role this order plays in belnap s semantics for a four - valued logic .",
    "we begin by giving basic definitions and establishing the terminology we shall adopt henceforth .",
    "we warn that the definitions ( bilattice , pre - bilattice , etc . )",
    "are not used in a consistent way in the literature , and that notation varies .",
    "our choice of symbols for lattice operations enables us to keep overt which operations relate to truth and which to knowledge .",
    "alternative notation includes @xmath15 and @xmath16 in place of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 in place of @xmath8 and  @xmath7 .",
    "we define first the most general class of algebras we shall consider .",
    "we shall say that an algebra @xmath19 is an _ unbounded distributive pre - bilattice _",
    "if each of the reducts @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a lattice and each of @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 distributes over each of the other three .",
    "the class of such algebras is a variety , which we denote by @xmath22 .",
    "each of the varieties we consider in this paper and in @xcite will be obtained from @xmath22 by expanding the language by adding constants , or additional unary or binary operations .",
    "given @xmath23 , we let @xmath24 and refer to it as the _ truth lattice reduct _ of @xmath25 ( or @xmath3-lattice for short ) ; likewise we have a _ knowledge lattice reduct _ ( or @xmath4-lattice ) @xmath26 .",
    "the following lemma is an elementary consequence of the definitions .",
    "we record it here to emphasise that no structure beyond that of an unbounded distributive pre - bilattice is involved .",
    "[ lem : cong ] let @xmath27 .",
    "then , for @xmath28 ,    @xmath29 implies @xmath30 ;    @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes either @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "corresponding statements hold with @xmath4 and @xmath3 interchanged .    as we have indicated in the introduction",
    ", we shall wish to prove , for each bilattice variety  @xmath10 we study , that @xmath10 is finitely generated as a quasivariety .",
    "this amounts to showing that there exists a finite set @xmath14 of finite algebras in  @xmath10 such that , for each @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath25 , there is @xmath35 and a @xmath10-homomorphism @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "( @xmath14 will consist of a single subdirectly irreducible algebra or at most two such algebras . )",
    "this separation property is linked to the existence of particular quotients of the algebras in  @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly we are led to investigate congruences .",
    "we start with a known result .",
    "our proof is direct and elementary : it uses nothing more than the distributivity properties of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-lattice operations , together with lemma  [ lem : cong ] and basic facts about lattice congruences given , for example , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  6 ) .",
    "( customarily the lemma would be obtained as a spin - off from the product representation theorem as this applies to distributive bilattices . )",
    "[ lem : cong2 ] let @xmath38 be an unbounded distributive pre - bilattice .",
    "let @xmath39 be an equivalence relation .",
    "then the following statements are equivalent :    @xmath40 is a congruence of @xmath41 ;    @xmath40 is a congruence of @xmath26 ;    @xmath40 is a congruence of @xmath25 .",
    "it will suffice , by symmetry , to prove ( i ) @xmath42 ( ii ) .",
    "so assume that  ( i ) holds .",
    "since @xmath40 is a congruence of @xmath43 , the @xmath40-equivalence classes are convex sublattices with respect to the @xmath1 order .",
    "we first observe that from lemma  [ lem : cong](i ) each equivalence class is convex with respect to the @xmath2 order , and from lemma  [ lem : cong](ii ) that each equivalence class is a sublattice of @xmath21 .",
    "finally we need to establish the quadrilateral property : @xmath44 for the forward direction observe that the distributive laws and lemma  [ lem : cong](ii ) ( swapping @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) imply @xmath45 combining this with @xmath46 and with the fact that @xmath40 is a congruence of @xmath43 , we have @xmath47 . replacing @xmath5 by @xmath6 in the previous argument",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "this proves that @xmath49_{\\theta}\\land_t [ b]_{\\theta}= [ a]_{\\theta}\\land_t [ a\\lor_k b]_{\\theta}\\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad [ a]_{\\theta}\\lor_t [ b]_{\\theta}= [ a]_{\\theta}\\lor_t [ a\\lor_k b]_{\\theta}.\\ ] ] since @xmath50 is distributive , @xmath51_{\\theta}=[a\\lor_k b]_{\\theta}$ ] , that is , @xmath52",
    ".    the following consequences of proposition  [ lem : cong2 ] will be important later .",
    "take an unbounded distributive pre - bilattice @xmath25 and a filter @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath53 is a convex sublattice of @xmath55 .",
    "if a map @xmath56 acts as a lattice homomorphism from @xmath54 into the two - element lattice  @xmath57 , then @xmath58 is a lattice homomorphism from @xmath55 into either  @xmath57 or its dual lattice @xmath59 .",
    "hence each prime filter for @xmath54 is either a prime filter or a prime ideal for @xmath55 and vice versa .",
    "these results were first proved in ( * ? ? ? * lemma 1.11 and theorem 1.12 ) and underpin the development of the duality theory presented there .",
    "we now wish to consider the situation in which a distributive pre - bilattice has universal bounds with respect to its @xmath1 and @xmath2 orders .",
    "we recall a classic result , known as the @xmath60  lemma .",
    "the result has its origins in @xcite ( see the comments in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) and also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) ) .",
    "[ 90deg ] let @xmath61 be an unbounded distributive pre - bilattice .",

    "the import of lemma  [ 90deg](i ) is that @xmath8 and @xmath7 are term - definable from @xmath6 and @xmath5 and the universal bounds of the @xmath4-lattice ; henceforth when these bounds are included in the type we shall exclude @xmath8 and @xmath7 from it . when we refer to an algebra @xmath71 as being an unbounded distributive pre - bilattice we do not exclude the possibility that one , and hence both , of @xmath55 and  @xmath54 has universal bounds ; we are simply saying that bounds are not included in the algebraic language .",
    "we say an algebra @xmath72 is a _ distributive pre - bilattice _",

    "do we have a two - element algebra which supports an involutory negation which preserves @xmath7 and @xmath8 and interchanges @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence neither @xmath92 nor @xmath90 contains a two - element algebra .",
    "similarly , if either variety contained a three - element algebra , having universe @xmath123 , with @xmath124 , then  @xmath2 would have to coincide with either @xmath1 or @xmath122 .",
    "the only involutory dual endomorphism of the @xmath3-reduct of the chain swaps @xmath76 and @xmath77 and fixes @xmath125 , and this map is not order - preserving with respect to  @xmath2 . we conclude that , whether or not bounds are included in the type , there is no non - trivial distributive bilattice of cardinality less than four .",
    "hence , the @xmath60 lemma implies that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the only four - element algebras in @xmath90 and @xmath92 , respectively .    as noted above , to derive a natural duality for any one of the varieties in which we are interested , we need to express the variety @xmath10 in question as a finitely generated quasivariety .",

    "such results are central to our enterprise .",
    "all are elementary in that the proofs use a minimum of bilattice theory and none of the algebraic structure theorems for bilattices is needed .",
    "( there is a close connection between our assertions above and the identification of the subdirectly irreducible algebras in the varieties concerned .",
    "the latter has traditionally been handled by first proving a product representation theorem .",
    "we reiterate that we prove our claims directly , by elementary  means . )",
    "as indicated in section  [ sec : intro ] , we shall introduce natural duality machinery in the form that is simplest to apply to each of the varieties we consider .",
    "we first consider @xmath128 , where @xmath12 is a finite algebra with a lattice reduct .",

    "we shall present without further preamble the first of the duality theorems we shall use .",

    "this will lead to the known product decomposition of distributive pre - bilattices with and without bounds .",
    "we choose not to develop this here , since we would need to introduce the multisorted version of the piggyback duality ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  7.2.1 ) ) .",

    "the scope of our work is somewhat different from that of other investigators of bilattices . throughout we have restricted attention to the distributive case .",
    "we have not ventured into the territory of logical bilattices in this paper , but we do observe that such bilattices are customarily assumed to be distributive .",
    "nevertheless we should comment on the role of distributivity , as compared with the weaker condition of interlacing .",
    "any interlaced ( pre)-lattice has a product representation and , conversely , such a representation is available only if the two lattice structures are linked by interlacing .",
    "accordingly the product representation features very strongly in the literature . as indicated in section  [ sec : prodrep ] , the dual representations obtained in @xcite and in @xcite build on priestley duality as it applies to the varieties @xmath83 and @xmath91 .",
    "the setting , perforce , is now that in which the bilattice structures are distributive and have bounds ; the product representation is brought into play to handle the @xmath4-lattice operations .",
    "we next comment on the role of congruences . in this paper ,",
    "the core result is proposition  [ lem : cong2 ] asserting that the congruences of any distributive pre - bilattice coincide with the congruences of the @xmath3-lattice reduct and with the congruences of the @xmath4-lattice reduct . for the interlaced case , this result",
    "is obtained with the aid of the product representation and leads on to a description of subdirectly irreducible algebras ; see @xcite .",
    "we exploited proposition  [ lem : cong2 ] to obtain our @xmath843 results for each of @xmath90 , @xmath92 , @xmath86 and @xmath22 .",
    "these results are of course immediate once the subdirectly irreducible algebras are known , but our method of proof is much more direct .",
    "conversely , our results immediately yield descriptions of the subdirectly irreducibles .    from what is said above it might appear that , in certain aspects our approach leads to the same principal results as previous approaches do , albeit by a different route .",
    "but we contend that we have done much more than this . in our setting",
    "we are able to harness the techniques of natural duality theory and to apply them in a systematic way to the best - known bilattice varieties .",
    "we hereby gain easy access to the applications presented , by way of illustration , in section  [ sec : applications ] .",
    "it is true that the dualities developed in @xcite and in @xcite can be described using our dualities and vice versa .",
    "however the deep connections between congruences of lattice reducts , our @xmath843 presentations , and the topological representation theory only becomes clear using natural dualities .",
    "we end our paper with an interesting byproduct of our treatment which links back to the origins of bilattices .",
    "the theory of bilattices and the investigation of four - valued logics have been intertwined ever since the concept of a bilattice was first introduced . in his seminal paper @xcite ( also available in @xcite ) , belnap introduced two lattices over the same four - element set @xmath844 , the logical lattice @xmath845 and the approximation lattice @xmath846 , the former admitting also a negation operation . with our notation , @xmath847 and @xmath848 .",
    "belnap defines a _ set - up _ as a map  @xmath849 from a set @xmath592 of atomic formulas into @xmath844 , and extends @xmath849 in a unique way to a homomorphism @xmath850 , where @xmath851 to the set of formulas in the language @xmath852 .",
    "he then introduces a logic , understood as an entailment relation between formulas based on set - ups and what is nowadays called a gentzen system which is complete for this logic .",
    "the connection between belnap s logic and de morgan lattices and de morgan algebras , hinted at in the definition of the former , was unveiled in detail by font in @xcite in the context of abstract algebraic logic .",
    "belnap did more than just define his logic : he also presented a mathematical formulation of the epistemic dynamic of the logic . to do this",
    ", he defined _ epistemic states _ as sets of set - ups and lifted the order on @xmath846 to a pre - order , @xmath853 ( the _ approximation order _ ) , between epistemic states .",
    "he then considered the partial order obtained from @xmath853 by quotienting by the equivalence relation @xmath854 and showed that the resulting poset is isomorphic to the family of upward - closed sets of set - ups ; here set - ups are considered as elements of @xmath855 and are ordered pointwise .",
    "this emphasises the importance of the poset structure , as opposed to the algebraic structure , of @xmath846 .",
    "furthermore , it is proved that , for each formula @xmath856 , the assignment @xmath857 maps conjunctions to intersections , disjunctions to unions and @xmath858 .",
    "so we could interpret belnap s results as a representation of @xmath851 as upward - closed subsets of homomorphisms from @xmath851 to @xmath845 ordered pointwise by  @xmath846 .",
    "only a few steps are needed to connect belnap s representation , as outlined above , with the natural duality for de morgan algebras ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4.3.15 ) and the references therein .",
    "we adopt the notation of @xcite for the generating algebra , @xmath859 , and for the alter ego , @xmath860 .",
    "first observe that @xmath861 is a de morgan algebra .",
    "therefore each homomorphism @xmath862 factors through the free de morgan algebra @xmath863 .",
    "hence the set of set - ups can be identified with @xmath864 .",
    "it is also necessary to check that for each formula @xmath865 the sets @xmath866 and @xmath867 are related by the involution of the dual space of a de morgan algebra ; more precisely , @xmath868 . and",
    "finally , of course , topology plays its role by enabling one to characterise those upward - closed sets ( represented by maps ) that correspond to formulas .",
    "these observations serve to stress that @xmath845 and @xmath869 in belnap s works play quite different roles .",
    "moreover , these structures are intimately related to the roles of @xmath859 and @xmath860 in the natural duality for de morgan algebras .",
    "the idea of combining two lattices into one structure originated with ginsberg @xcite .",
    "the dualities presented in theorem  [ dbnatdual ] and  [ dbunatdual ] can be seen as a bridge reconciling belnap s and ginsberg s approaches , the first considering two separated lattice structures @xmath845 and @xmath846 with different roles but based on the same universe , and the latter combining them into a single algebraic structure .",
    "we , in like manner , work with two different structures @xmath98 and @xmath251 ( and @xmath99 and @xmath324 in the unbounded case ) with different structures having distinctive roles : one logical with an algebraic structure , the other epistemic with a poset structure ."
