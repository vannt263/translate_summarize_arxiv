    "in the course of the last two years , the research area of gravitational wave physics has entered a very exciting era . on the experimental side , the first generation of ground - based gravitational wave detectors , ligo , geo600 , tama300 and virgo , are performing observation runs at , and even beyond design sensitivity @xcite . at the same time , the simulation of the most promising sources of gravitational waves , the inspiral of compact binary systems , has made enormous progress .",
    "while approximate studies based on the post - newtonian approach have been able for some time to accurately simulate the earlier stages of inspiralling binary systems @xcite , recent developments in numerical relativity have made possible the simulation of the highly relativistic final stages of the inspiral and merger of compact binaries in the framework of fully nonlinear general relativity .    for a long time",
    "such simulations have been troubled by stability problems which caused evolutions to terminate after times relatively short compared with the dynamic timescales of the problems under investigation .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear now , however , that these problems have been successfully overcome by a combination of modified formulations of the einstein equations @xcite , suitable gauge conditions ( see e.g.@xcite ) and improved techniques for the treatment of the singularities inherent to black - hole spacetimes .    using such modern techniques ,",
    "brgmann et.al.@xcite obtained the first simulation of a complete orbit of a black - hole binary in the framework of the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation @xcite , using puncture data @xcite and corotating coordinates .",
    "more recently , their results have been confirmed by an improved study @xcite .",
    "the first waveforms generated in the inspiral and coalescence of black holes have been presented by pretorius @xcite who uses a generalized harmonic formulation of the einstein equations combined with special numerical techniques such as black - hole excision , spatial compactification and implicit finite differencing .",
    "the latest development , simultaneously discovered by campanelli et.al . and baker et.al .",
    "@xcite , is based on the evolution of black - hole data of puncture type using special gauge conditions accommodating the motion of the punctures across the computational domain . for this reason these simulations",
    "are commonly referred to as _ moving punctures_. more recently , this technique has facilitated the investigation of various aspects of the binary - black - hole coalescence , such as the radiation of linear momentum by systems of unequal masses and/or spins @xcite , the impact on the waveforms and merger dynamics of nonvanishing spins @xcite and analysis of the waveforms in the framework of post - newtonian inspiral and black - hole ring - down @xcite .",
    "as in the case of black holes , simulations lasting for several orbits have also been obtained for neutron star binaries by several groups @xcite . in more recent developments the focus is switching to the refinement of the matter models , as for example by the inclusion of magneto - hydrodynamic effects ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in our work , however , we focus on black - hole systems , and will therefore exclusively study vacuum spacetimes .    in spite of the dramatic progress in numerical simulations of black - hole binaries ,",
    "there remain important questions to be answered , in particular with regard to the use of the resulting waveforms in the ongoing effort to detect and physically interprete gravitational - wave signals .",
    "in particular it will be important to establish the accuracy of the numerically calculated waveforms and the consistency of these results with regard to the use of different types of binary - black - hole initial data and the evolution techniques used in the codes .",
    "first steps in this direction have been undertaken with regard to the use of evolution techniques and separation parameters of a given initial - data type . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the impact of black - hole excision was studied in the case of head - on collisions of brill - lindquist data .",
    "the results with and without excision yielded good agreement in that study . a comparison between plunge waveforms obtained from moving - puncture evolutions with those resulting from lazarus calculations",
    "@xcite has been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the waveforms resulting from inspiralling black holes of puncture type starting from different separations have been found to show excellent agreement in refs.@xcite .",
    "a comparison of waveforms obtained from evolving conceptually different types of initial data has been presented in @xcite .",
    "this study is inhibited , however , by the difficulties in starting the simulations from comparable initial configurations as is demonstrated by the nonvanishing spin in one of the two data sets considered in this work .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we present a new numerical code which has been designed to accommodate different types of initial data , formulations of the einstein equations as well as singularity treatment .",
    "we demonstrate that the code is capable of producing state - of - the - art simulations of inspiralling black - hole binaries and extract convergent waveforms .",
    "second , we use the code to further progress in the comparison of different initial configurations by comparing black - hole head - on collisions obtained from different types of initial data and using different evolution techniques . specifically , we compare the results obtained from superposed kerr - schild data evolved in the framework of black - hole excision and algebraic gauge conditions with those obtained from evolving brill - lindquist as well as misner data in the framework of the moving - puncture method .    this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin with a detailed presentation of the code in sec.[sec : numerics ] .",
    "next , we benchmark the code in sec.[sec : orbits ] by simulating the inspiral and merger of an orbiting black - hole binary comparable to those studied in the recent literature . the comparison of head - on collisions obtained with brill - lindquist , misner and kerr - schild data is given in sec.[sec : head - on ] and we conclude with a discussion of our findings in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "details on the exact version of the bssn equations used for this work , the analytic solution of a boosted black hole in kerr - schild coordinates , extraction of gravitational waves and the performance of the code are presented in appendices [ sec : bssn]-[sec : performance ] . throughout this work we set @xmath0 and",
    "use greek indices for spacetime components @xmath1 and latin indices for spatial components @xmath2 .",
    "the simulations presented in this work have been obtained with the newly developed lean code .",
    "this code has been inspired partly by the maya code @xcite , and partly by the most recent developments in the simulation of black - hole data of puncture type @xcite .",
    "it is based on the cactus computational toolkit @xcite , used for parallelization and data input / output .",
    "mesh refinement is provided by carpet @xcite , puncture initial data by the twopunctures thorn @xcite and horizon finding by ahfinderdirect @xcite .",
    "the code achieves dynamic mesh refinement by steering in accordance with the black - hole motion the regridding option inherent to the carpet package .",
    "while the lean code has been inspired by maya , it has been written entirely from scratch and various new features have been added .",
    "these are fourth - order discretization of the spatial derivatives , the evolution of the bssn equations using the @xmath3 version ( see below ) , additional gauge conditions , time integration using the fourth - order runge - kutta ( rk ) scheme , dynamic mesh refinement that allows for multiple refinement components to follow the black - hole motion and merge into single components and additional initial - data options including puncture data using the twopuncture thorn @xcite and misner data .",
    "furthermore , the different organization of the code has lead to about five times faster evolutions and a reduction by about a third in memory requirements compared with maya for a given configuration .",
    "details on the code s performance for the orbital simulations and head - on collisions are provided in app .",
    "[ sec : performance ] .",
    "the key feature of the code for the comparison presented below is the incorporation in the framework of mesh refinement of both , dynamic black - hole excision and the moving - puncture technique used with enormous success in evolutions of conformally flat initial data .",
    "these features as well as other aspects of the lean code are described in more detail in the remainder of this section .",
    "most of the numerical work in three spatial dimensions has been performed inside the framework of the canonical `` 3 + 1 '' spacetime decomposition of arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm ) @xcite ( see also @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the geometry is described in terms of the three - dimensional metric @xmath4 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath5 , as well as four gauge functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 which represent the coordinate freedom of general relativity .",
    "the einstein field equations result in six evolution equations each for @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as four constraint equations , namely the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "these equations are commonly referred to as the adm equations .",
    "while these equations have been at the heart of most numerical codes for a long time , the ensuing stability problems have lead to the use of various alternative formulations of the einstein equations , most of them modifications of the adm equations .",
    "the most popular and successful of these modified schemes is now known as the bssn system @xcite and has been implemented in the lean code . while the code also allows evolutions using the nagy - ortiz - reula ( nor ) @xcite or the generalized harmonic formulation @xcite , we have not yet managed to achieve long - term stable simulations using these systems .",
    "therefore , all simulations presented in this work have been obtained with the bssn system .    the bssn formulation results from applying the following modifications to the original adm equations : first , a split of the extrinsic curvature into a trace - free part @xmath8 and the trace @xmath9 , second , a conformal rescaling of the three - metric and the extrinsic curvature and , third , the introduction of contracted christoffel symbols as separate variables @xmath10 .",
    "one thus arrives at a description of the spacetime in terms of the variables @xmath11 as well as the gauge functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "here , @xmath12 denotes @xmath13 and the definition of @xmath14 implies that @xmath15 . alternatively to this choice of variables the lean code also allows for evolutions using the variable @xmath16 as introduced in ref .",
    "the complete evolution equations for both sets of variables are listed in appendix [ sec : bssn ] .",
    "we refer to the two resulting systems given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma])-([eq : gamma ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , ( [ eq : tracek ] ) , ( [ eq : chi])-([eq : gamma2 ] ) as the @xmath14 and the @xmath3 version of the bssn equations respectively in the remainder of this work .",
    "in addition to evolving the bssn variables according to either of these systems , we enforce after each update of the variables the condition @xmath17 , which is a consequence of the definition of @xmath18 in eq.([eq : bssn_vars ] ) .",
    "we find this step to be crucial for the stability of our simulations .",
    "other modifications to the bssn equations have been suggested in the literature [ see e.g.@xcite ] .",
    "we have experimented with several of these , but not observed any further improvements of the performance of the code . in particular we do not find it necessary to enforce the condition @xmath19 or to replace the variable @xmath10 in terms of the christoffel symbols at any stage of the evolution .",
    "one main purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed comparison of binary - black - hole collisions obtained with different initial - data types .",
    "we now describe the different initial data available inside the code .",
    "specifically , these are puncture , misner and superposed kerr - schild data .",
    "the starting point for binary - black - hole data of the puncture type is the schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates , where the spacetime curvature is captured entirely within the conformal factor @xmath20 . in the case of time symmetry ,",
    "these conformally flat data have been shown to generalize to an arbitrary number of black holes by merely adding the individual quotients in the conformal factor @xcite @xmath21 where the index @xmath22 labels the individual black holes .",
    "this time - symmetric initial configuration of multiple black holes is known as brill - lindquist data . as a further generalization of these data , spin and momentum",
    "can be incorporated in the form of a nonvanishing extrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "finally , brandt and brgmann @xcite have transformed this type of data into a form substantially more convenient for the use in numerical simulations by applying a compactification to the internal asymptotically flat regions of the holes ( see their paper for existence and uniqueness of the solutions for the hamiltonian constraint ) .",
    "these data are commonly referred to as punctures and have been widely used in numerical simulations .    inside the lean code ,",
    "initial data of brill - lindquist type are implemented analytically using eq.([eq : psibl ] ) .",
    "more general classes of puncture data are made available via the twopunctures thorn of ansorg et.al.@xcite , which solves the hamiltonian constraint using spectral methods combined with transformations to a coordinate system specially adapted to the structure of the binary - black - hole spacetime [ see @xcite for details ] .",
    "the second class of initial data we study in this work are the axisymmetric misner data @xcite which represent a conformally flat spacetime containing two nonspinning equal - mass black holes at the moment of time symmetry ( @xmath23 ) . in cartesian",
    "coordinates the three - metric @xmath4 for this configuration can be written as @xmath24 where the conformal factor is given by @xmath25        \\label{eq : misner_psi } \\label{eq : misner } \\\\",
    "z_n & = & \\coth\\,n\\mu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath26 is a free parameter determining the initial separation of the holes @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass of the system .    as an alternative to these two conformally flat data types ,",
    "the lean code allows the use of nonspinning black - hole binary data based on the kerr - schild solution for a single black hole @xcite .",
    "the invariance of the structure of the kerr - schild data under boost transformations has motivated their use in boosted , superposed form .",
    "even though these superposed data do not exactly satisfy the einstein constraints for finite separation of the holes , they have been studied extensively in the literature , both as initial data and in the context of binary - black - hole evolutions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "whenever we speak of superposed kerr - schild data in the remainder of this work , we thus refer to this direct superposition of the data which has been used in evolutions before .",
    "we are currently not aware of any time evolutions presented in the literature that start with kerr - schild data _ after _ applying a constraint solving procedure .    in order to construct the data ,",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "the solution of a single boosted , nonspinning kerr - schild hole with mass parameter @xmath29 and velocity @xmath30 is calculated according to the prescription presented in app .",
    "[ sec : bks ] .",
    "the two solutions thus obtained for black holes at positions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are then superposed according to @xmath33 we note that with this specific superposition , lapse @xmath6 and shift @xmath7 obey the close - limit condition , i.e.they lead to the lapse and shift of a single kerr - schild hole in the limit of zero separation .",
    "an important ingredient in the recent success of numerical simulations of black - hole binaries has been the implementation of improved gauge conditions . in terms of the `` 3 + 1 '' decomposition ,",
    "the coordinate invariance of general relativity is represented by the freedom to arbitrarily specify the lapse function @xmath6 and the shift vector  @xmath7 .",
    "while the particular choice of these functions leaves unaffected the physical properties of the spacetime , it can have a dramatic effect on the stability properties of a numerical simulation .",
    "in the past , the majority of gauge conditions have been designed with the purpose to drive the system of variables towards a stationary configuration ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in combination with the use of comoving coordinates ,",
    "this approach lead to the first simulation of a complete binary - black - hole orbit @xcite .",
    "more recent developments , however , have shown a tendency towards allowing the black holes to move across the computational domain ( see e.g.@xcite for single moving black holes and head - on collisions and @xcite for orbiting black holes ) .",
    "we have implemented in the lean code both the use of algebraic gauge conditions along the lines reported in @xcite as well as live - gauge conditions similar to those presented in @xcite for the evolutions of black holes of the moving - puncture type ( see also @xcite for a more detailed numerical study and @xcite for an analytic study of these types of gauge choices ) .",
    "experimentally , we have found variations in these live - gauge conditions to manifest themselves most conspicuously in the profile of the variables @xmath10 near the punctures . in particular , we have noticed that steep gradients in these functions resulted in poor convergence properties of the merger time of the black holes , or , worse , instabilities .",
    "we have found optimal performance of our code in this respect by evolving the gauge variables according to @xmath34 initially we have experimented with setting @xmath35 , but observed an instability in the outermost refinement boundary for coarser resolutions .",
    "we have found the choice @xmath36 to cure that instability while preserving the good convergence properties of the code and therefore use this value throughout this work .",
    "the gauge variables are initialized by using zero shift with a precollapsed lapse @xmath37 .",
    "the gauge conditions ( [ eq : alpha])([eq : b ] ) do not only provide stable evolutions , but also facilitate a comparatively simple method to track the black - hole position . as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the vanishing of @xmath3 at the puncture in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) implies that @xmath38 we have implemented this relation via interpolation of the shift vector at the puncture location and subsequent update of the position using a second - order runge - kutta method . in practice we find excellent agreement between the resulting locations of the puncture and the coordinate center of the apparent horizon as calculated by ahfinderdirect from surface integrals of the global coordinates over the horizon .",
    "in the case of the evolutions of kerr - schild data , we have also experimented with these gauge conditions .",
    "so far , however , we have not managed to obtain long - term stable evolutions in this way .",
    "we have therefore reverted to the approach of using algebraic gauge according to the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "that is , we prescribe analytic trajectories @xmath39 , @xmath40 for black holes a and b and calculate the resulting gauge functions by superposing the analytic gauge of the individual holes .",
    "following @xcite we prescribe the analytic slicing condition in the form of the densitized lapse @xmath41 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath42 here the quantities denoted with an a or b are the analytic expressions for the individual black holes and @xmath43 is the superposed metric defined in eq.([eq : ks_gamma ] ) . in practice",
    ", we calculate the lapse from its densitized counterpart and the determinant of the numerical three - metric via @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that we use the densitized lapse only for algebraic slicing , but work with the unmodified lapse in all simulations using live - gauge conditions .",
    "the trajectories used to evaluate the positions and velocities for the gauge functions associated with the individual black holes are obtained from fifth order polynomials @xmath45 during the earlier stages of the infall of the black holes . in a time interval @xmath46 we perform a smooth ( up to the fourth derivative ) transition of these polynomials to the static function @xmath47 . by virtue of the close - limit property of the superposed gauge ( [ eq : beta_ief ] ) , ( [ eq : q_ief ] ) , we thus obtain a smooth transition of the gauge to that of a single nonspinning kerr - schild hole .    the most difficult part in this procedure is to determine the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 so that one obtains a stable simulation .",
    "we have only managed to obtain stable evolutions using gauge trajectories that are close to the coordinate trajectories of the apparent horizon center , in particular in the late stages of the infall . in practice",
    "the black holes collide along the @xmath53 axis and we set the @xmath54 and @xmath55 components of all coefficients to zero .",
    "the remaining @xmath53 components are then obtained iteratively : the black holes are evolved with some initial guess for the coefficients ( normally those used for the simulation with the next smaller initial separation ) .",
    "the apparent horizon center is tracked until this simulation becomes unstable and we adjust the parameters to make the gauge trajectory agree better with the horizon motion .",
    "this process is repeated until a stable simulation is obtained .",
    "some minor variations of the parameters are possible while preserving the stability of the simulation but do not have a significant impact on the resulting waveforms as is discussed below in sec .",
    "[ sec : kstest ] .",
    "the exact parameters used for the kerr - schild simulations in this work are given below in table [ tab : bief_traj ] . unless specified otherwise , we use the trajectories labelled `` a '' in that table .",
    "evolutions of puncture - type initial data have been performed in the past both with and without the use of black - hole excision ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "those without excision have commonly been achieved by factoring out the irregular part of the conformal factor while evolving only the regular remainder .",
    "it is a remarkable and surprising feature of the moving - puncture evolutions introduced in @xcite , that these evolutions have been successful using neither excision , nor the factoring out of the irregular part of the conformal factor .",
    "below we will follow the same approach for our puncture / brill - lindquist and misner evolutions .    in order to evolve kerr - schild data ,",
    "however , we need to use black - hole excision . in contrast to puncture data , the spatial slices of the kerr - schild data do contain the physical singularity of the black hole at @xmath56 , which needs to be removed from the computational domain . inside the lean code",
    "we have implemented black - hole excision using either one - sided derivatives or extrapolation techniques .",
    "so far , we have obtained better stability properties using extrapolation which is the method of choice for all simulations presented in this work .",
    "this particular excision algorithm has been described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the lean code",
    "the moving excision has now been generalized to work with moving refinement components . for this purpose each black hole has been assigned a particular refinement level it resides in ( the finest level in all simulations presented in this work ) .",
    "excision for this black hole is then only performed on this refinement level and communication to coarser levels is performed exclusively via the restriction procedure inside carpet .",
    "special care must be taken in the black - hole excision if the refinement component has been moved because the integer grid indices @xmath57 no longer correspond to the same coordinate position @xmath58 as on previous time steps . because the set of excision boundary points is stored in terms of their indices @xmath57 , rather than their coordinate positions",
    ", we must recalculate the list of excision boundary points every time the refinement component moves .",
    "this process does not involve changing any of the bssn variables , however ; it merely corrects the book - keeping of the excision mask .    with a correct list of excision points available at every time step we thus apply extrapolation of the bssn variables via second - order polynomials during each iteration of the iterated crank - nicholson ( icn ) cycle according to the procedure in sec .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . after the completion of the whole time step ,",
    "the code checks for the position of the black hole and adjusts the center of the excision region if necessary . as a minor modification compared with the excision method of the maya code used in @xcite",
    ", we use the horizon finder to track the black - hole motion and move the excision region accordingly .",
    "so far , we have not succeeded in combining black - hole excision with the fourth - order discretization of the spatial derivatives .",
    "the problems largely arise from the need to use an excision boundary of thickness @xmath59 to accommodate the wider fourth - order accurate stencils . for this reason",
    ", we use second - order discretization in space for all simulations using black - hole excision .",
    "a further area of remarkable progress in numerical relativity in recent years is that of mesh refinement , which is used almost routinely now in various forms in black - hole simulations .",
    "the need for using mesh refinement or essentially equivalent techniques based on specially adapted coordinates such as the `` fish - eye transformation '' @xcite , arises from the presence of vastly different length scales in the spacetimes . on the one hand , a code has to resolve the steep gradients near the black - hole horizon , typically leading to length scales comparable with the mass of the hole . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical wavelength associated with the ringing of a black hole is one order of magnitude larger .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of accurate waveforms makes it necessary to extract waves at sufficiently large radii , ideally , in the wave zone .",
    "this requires the use of computational grids at least two orders of magnitude larger than the radius of a single black hole . with current computational power",
    ", this can only be achieved inside the framework of mesh refinement .",
    "simulations of moving black holes add the extra requirement of dynamic or adaptive refinement .    in the lean code ,",
    "mesh refinement is provided by the carpet package .",
    "dynamic refinement based on carpet has already been reported in @xcite .",
    "here we use a refined version of this method .",
    "carpet provides a routine which performs a _ regridding _ operation at regular intervals .",
    "that is , it interpretes a steerable parameter string which contains the exact specifications of all refinement components in terms of their corner positions . inside the lean code",
    ", we control this parameter string via a separate thorn regridinfo which works as follows .",
    "this thorn creates a map between each refinement component and the black hole it is tied to ( a zero entry meaning the component is not tied to black - hole motion and remains stationary ) . the black - hole motion , in turn , is monitored , either using the horizon finder or the puncture tracking method according to eq.([eq : punc_tracking ] ) .",
    "the corner positions of the refinement components are adjusted according to the motion of the black holes .",
    "the regridinfo thorn further performs checks on the internal consistency of the grid specifications and , if necessary , expands a component to guarantee that all finer components are accommodated with a minimum number of grid points between the refinement boundaries .",
    "similarly , it expands components once the black - hole position comes too close to a refinement boundary .",
    "finally , the thorn allows for the merger of previously separate refinement components .",
    "this is triggered by the distance between two components decreasing below a user - specified threshold value .",
    "again , the parameter string used by carpet is updated accordingly and the regridding completes the dynamic adjustment of the mesh refinement .",
    "we find this technique to work very reliably and to preserve remarkably well the expected convergence properties of the code , as will be demonstrated below in sec.[sec : orbits ] .    for a given simulation the initial grid consists of two types of cubic refinement levels , @xmath60 outer levels centered on the origin which remain stationary throughout the simulation and @xmath29 levels with two components centered around either black hole . in the remainder of this work",
    "we specify the exact setup by giving the resolution @xmath61 on the finest level as well as the radius of the cubes excluding ghost zones required for interprocessor communication .",
    "the grid spacing always increases by a factor of two from one level to the next coarser refinement level .",
    "for example , @xmath62 specifies a grid with six fixed outer components of radius @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively and two refinement levels with two components each with radius @xmath69 and @xmath70 centered around either hole .",
    "the resolution is @xmath71 on the finest level and successively increases to @xmath72 on the outermost level . in this work",
    "we will use equatorial as well as octant symmetry which reduces the number of points by a factor of @xmath73 or 8 respectively .",
    "the grid setups used for the simulations of this work are summarized in table [ tab : grids ] .      in app .",
    "[ sec : bssn ] we have listed explicitly the @xmath14 and @xmath3 version of the bssn equations as used in the lean code .",
    "the discretization of the spatial derivatives has been implemented in the form of second - order as well as fourth - order accurate stencils . with the exception of the advection derivatives of the form",
    "@xmath74 these stencils are centered .",
    "advection derivatives , on the other hand , are approximated with lop - sided stencils @xmath75 respectively for second and fourth - order accurate discretization , with @xmath76 and likewise for the @xmath55 and @xmath53 direction .",
    ".grid setup and numerical schemes used for the simulations presented in this work .",
    "the resolutions used for the convergence studies are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 for models r1 and bl2 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 for model ks4 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 for model m4 .",

    "the columns show the courant factor @xmath87 which scales linearly with the code s speed , the number of processors used in the simulation , the required memory as well as the speed .",
    "the latter is measured in physical time in units of the adm mass @xmath28 of the system per real time and processor .    regarding the memory usage we observe minor variations , typically below @xmath88 , in the course of the simulation .",
    "this is due to the merger of refinement components as the black holes approach each other .",
    "the merger of refinement components also leads to an increase in speed because the costly regridding operation is no longer required and the total number of grid points of the merged refinement component is smaller than the sum of the two individual ones prior to merging .",
