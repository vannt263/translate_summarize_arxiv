    "the statistical model has been applied successfully in description of the soft part of particle production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "namely , the particle yield ratios and @xmath1 spectra were fitted accurately with the use of only four parameters ( for particle ratio fits two parameters are enough : the temperature @xmath2 and the baryon number chemical potential @xmath3 ) .",
    "now , those parameters will be used to evaluate global observables : the transverse energy density @xmath4 , the charged particle multiplicity density @xmath5 and their ratio ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is based on the fact that the transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity measurements are independent of hadron spectroscopy ( in particular , no particle identification is necessary ) , therefore they could be used as an additional test of the self - consistency of a statistical model .",
    "the experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the polar angle , @xmath8 denotes @xmath9 ( @xmath10 means the nucleon mass ) for baryons and the total energy @xmath11 for all other particles , and the sum is taken over all @xmath12 emitted particles @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the case of rhic at @xmath0 gev , @xmath13 is taken instead of @xmath11 for antibaryons @xcite .    the statistical model with single freeze - out is used ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the model very well reproduces ratios and @xmath1 spectra of particles measured at rhic @xcite .",
    "the main assumption of the model is the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and thermal freeze - outs , which means that the possible elastic interactions after the chemical freeze - out are neglected .",
    "the conditions for the freeze - out are expressed by values of two independent thermal parameters : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath14 is determined from the requirement that the overall strangeness of the gas equals zero .",
    "the actually detected ( stable ) particles have two sources : ( _ a _ ) a thermal gas and ( _ b _ ) secondaries produced by decays and sequential decays of primordial resonances . the distributions of particles from source ( _ a _ ) are given by a bose - einstein or a fermi - dirac distribution at the freeze - out point .",
    "the distributions of secondaries ( source ( _ b _ ) ) can be obtained from the elementary kinematics of a many - body decay or from the superposition of two or more such decays ( for details see @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "all possible ( 2- , 3- and 4-body ) decays with branching ratios not less than @xmath15 are considered .",
    "also almost all cascades ( with the exclusion of a very few like 4- or 5-step ones such that they proceed via at least one 3- or 4-body decay ) are taken into account .",
    "it should be stressed that all contributions from weak decays are included in the presented analysis .",
    "the foundations of the model are as follows : ( _ a _ ) the chemical and thermal freeze - outs take place simultaneously , ( _ b _ ) all confirmed resonances up to a mass of @xmath16 gev from the particle data tables @xcite are taken into account , ( _ c _ ) a freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the equation    @xmath17    ( _ d _ ) the four - velocity of an element of the freeze - out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate    @xmath18    ( _ e _ ) the transverse size is restricted by the condition @xmath19 . in this way one has two additional parameters of the model , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , connected with the geometry of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "the maximum transverse - flow parameter ( or the surface velocity ) is given by    @xmath22    the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species @xmath23 has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath24    where @xmath25 is the normal vector on a freeze - out hypersurface , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the four - velocity of a fluid element and @xmath28 is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question .",
    "the final distribution means here that @xmath28 is the sum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the pseudorapidity density of particle species @xmath23 is given by    @xmath29    analogously , the transverse energy pseudorapidity density for the same species can be written as    @xmath30    for the quantities at midrapidity one has    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the velocity of the center of mass of two colliding nuclei with respect to the laboratory frame ( only for rhic @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that for rhic at @xmath0 gev there is the third possibility in eq .",
    "( [ etdenmid ] ) : if @xmath35 , the analogous formula as for @xmath36 but with @xmath37 in the numerator holds",
    ".    the overall charged particle and transverse energy densities can be expressed as    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) denote sets of species of finally detected particles , namely the set of charged particles @xmath43 , whereas @xmath40 also includes photons , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the general scheme reviewed in the previous section was formulated originally for rhic @xcite and then applied for sps @xcite . here , this method will be used also for the ags case .",
    "but the different model of the freeze - out hypersurface was applied for the description of @xmath1 spectra there @xcite . in that model ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) , the freeze - out happens instantaneously in the @xmath46 direction , _",
    "i.e. _ at a constant value of @xmath47 ( _ not _ at a constant value of @xmath20 as here ) .",
    "the parameters connected with the expansion are the surface velocity @xmath48 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the implementation of values of @xmath48 obtained within that model into the presented one is entirely _ ad hoc _ , nevertheless it works surprisingly well . to put values of @xmath48 from @xcite into formulae of sect .",
    "[ foundat ] , one should invert eq .  ( [ betmax ] ) to obtain    @xmath49    it should be recalled here that the value of @xmath20 itself is not necessary to calculate the transverse energy per charged particle , since this parameter cancels in the ratio .",
    "the final results of numerical estimates of @xmath50 and @xmath51 together with the corresponding experimental data are listed in table[table1 ] . to make predictions for the ags case",
    "it has been assumed that the maximal transverse size @xmath21 equals the average of radii of two colliding nuclei and the nucleus radius has been expressed as @xmath52 fm . generally , the estimates agree well with the data .",
    "however , for rhic the @xmath53 underestimation of the charged particle density has been found .",
    "but this simply reflects the existing inconsistency in measurements of the charged particle multiplicity at rhic .",
    "namely , the sum of integrated charged hadron yields @xcite , after converting to @xmath5 @xcite , is substantially less then the directly measured @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this is shown explicitly in the last column of table[table1 ] . but",
    "values of the sum agree very well with the model predictions .",
    "since the geometric parameters were established from the fits to the same @xmath1 spectra , the agreement had to be obtained .",
    "also for ags the results agree qualitatively well with the data , in spite of the roughness of the method applied for this case .",
    "the overall error of evaluations of transverse energy and charged particle densities is about @xmath54 and is caused by : ( _ a _ ) omission of the most complex cascades ; ( _ b _ ) simplifications in numerical procedures for more involved cascades .",
    "the velocity of the center of mass of two colliding nuclei , @xmath33 , equals : 0 for rhic , 0.994 for sps pb - pb collisions at @xmath55 gev , 0.918 for ags au - au collisions at @xmath56 gev and 0.678 for ags si - pb collisions at @xmath57 gev .",
    ".[table1 ] values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 calculated in the framework of the statistical model with expansion . in the first column",
    "thermal and geometric parameters are listed for the corresponding collisions . in the third and last column",
    "experimental data for the most central collisions are given .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      values of the transverse energy per charged particle at midrapidity for the most central collisions .",
    "black dots denote evaluations of the ratio in the framework of the present model ( the second column of table[table2 ] ) .",
    "also data points for ags @xcite ( a circle for au - au and a vertical bar for si - pb ) , sps @xcite ( triangle ) , rhic at @xmath58 gev @xcite ( square ) and rhic at @xmath0 gev @xcite ( star ) are depicted . for rhic , points with the sum of integrated charged hadron yields substituted for the denominator are also depicted ( crosses ) . ]",
    "these results have been also depicted together with the data in fig.[fig.1 . ] .",
    "one can see that the relative positions of theoretical points agree very well with the data , they are shifted up only and this is the effect of the overestimation discussed earlier .",
    "the expanding thermal hadron gas model has been used to reproduce transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity pseudorapidity densities and their ratio measured at ags , sps and rhic .",
    "the importance of the present analysis originates from the fact that the transverse energy and the charged particle multiplicity are _ independent observables _ , so they can be used as new tools to verify the consistency of predictions of a statistical model for all colliders simultaneously .",
    "the predictions have been made at the previous estimates of thermal and geometric freeze - out parameters obtained from analyses of measured particle ratios and @xmath1 spectra at ags @xcite , sps @xcite and rhic @xcite .",
    "the overall good agreement , not only of the ratio but also absolute values of @xmath59 and @xmath51 , with the data has been achieved . and the observed discrepancies can be explained reasonably .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that the thermal expanding source is responsible for the soft part of the particle production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in addition , the description of various observables is consistent within one statistical model",
    ".    there are more arguments in favour of the above statement .",
    "one could think that this analysis is a kind of an internal consistency check of various measurements . and",
    "such a check could be done even in an model - independent way simply by integrating spectra of stable particles .",
    "but it can not be done without any external input .",
    "first , transverse momentum spectra are measured in _ limited ranges _ , so very important low-@xmath1 regions are not covered by the data . therefore , to obtain integrated yields some extrapolations below and above the measured ranges are used . in fact these extrapolations are only analytical fits without any physical reasoning , but contributions from regions covered by them account for @xmath60 of the yield @xcite . on the other hand , a calorimeter acts very effectively in the low-@xmath1 range , namely pions with @xmath61 gev / c , kaons with @xmath62 gev / c and protons and antiprotons with @xmath63 gev / c are all captured @xcite .",
    "since the very accurate predictions for the transverse energy density at midrapidity have been obtained ( see table[table1 ] ) , the present analysis can be understood as an undirect proof that in these unmeasurable @xmath1 regions spectra are also explicable by means of the thermal source with flow and decays .    moreover , it is impossible to check the consistency of the transverse energy data because not all stable hadron spectra are measured .",
    "this mainly concerns neutrons and @xmath64 .",
    "also it is impossible to extract hadron decay photons from the photon data . and",
    "again , the very good agreement of model estimates of the transverse energy density at midrapidity with the data can be interpreted as the strong argument that the production of neutral stable particles can be described in terms of the expanding thermal source with superimposed decays .    and",
    "as the last remark : in opposite to the transverse energy , there is some inconsistency ( of the order of @xmath65 ) of the independent measurements of the charged particle multiplicity with the corresponding sums of integrated charged particle yields at rhic ( see sect .",
    "[ finl ] ) .",
    "but at the present stage of investigation it is difficult to judge whether this inconsistency has the physical or experimental reason .",
