    "latitudinal variations in the thermal structure of the solar convective envelope have been implied or required by theories ranging from non - general - relativistic gravity @xcite to those explaining the solar differential rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , meridional circulation , and torsional oscillations @xcite .",
    "models of the solar differential rotation and meridional circulation reproduce the observed helioseismic rotation profiles @xcite best when baroclinicity is introduced via a latitudinal temperature gradient in region of the solar tachocline which spreads into the convection zone proper by turbulent convection @xcite . while it is estimated from such models that in the solar photosphere the pole may be as much as a few degrees warmer and the mid - latitudes a couple of degrees cooler than the equatorial region ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these estimates are model dependent and measurements have proven difficult .",
    "the difficulties arise because of the intrinsically low amplitude thermal signal expected and the presence of magnetic structures which introduce small scale intensity fluctuations of comparable or greater amplitude .",
    "thus , previous observations have yielded wide ranging results ( table  [ table1 ] ) .    here",
    "we examine full disk images from the precision solar photometric telescope ( pspt ) at the mauna loa solar observatory ( mlso ) .",
    "the telescope should by design readily allow measurement of latitudinal temperature variations if they are a few degrees in magnitude . in  2 below we review the telescope capabilities and data processing techniques necessary to realize those . in ",
    "3 we present the results obtained and in  4 discuss the uncertainties in these due to random and systematic errors . finally , we conclude in  5 by putting our methods and results in the context of previous measurements .",
    "the pspt at the mlso is a small ( 15 cm ) refracting telescope designed for photometric solar observations with the aim of achieving an unprecedented 0.1% pixel - to - pixel relative photometric precision .",
    "it acquires full - disk solar images on a @xmath2 ccd array ( @xmath3/pixel ) in three wavelength bands : blue continuum ( @xmath4 fwhm @xmath5 nm ) , red continuum ( @xmath6 fwhm @xmath7 ) , and caiik ( @xmath8 fwhm @xmath9 nm ) .",
    "the red continuum band is quite clear of absorption lines while the blue continuum is not ( profiles superimposed on reference spectra are available on the pspt web site ) .",
    "the quiet - sun formation heights ( relative to optical depth unity at 500 nm and over the fwhm of the filter band ) for these wavelengths are approximately @xcite : blue continuum , -10 to 35 km ; red continuum , 0 to 50 km ; and caiik line , 900 to 1660 km ( line core ) and 0 to 260 km ( line wings ) .",
    "the pspt concept and prototype are described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the pspt camera readout occurs in quadrants through four amplifiers of differing gain . in order to achieve in data",
    "images the photometric precision promised by the instrument design , these and other spatial variations in the detector must be determined to an equivalent accuracy .",
    "we accomplish this using a version of the algorithm of @xcite applied to sixteen offset images of the sun recorded once per day . by assuming that the sun is unchanged between each of these offset images and comparing both pixel intensities at identical image locations and pixel gains at identical detector locations , the procedure captures a best fit spatial mapping to the differences between the offset image intensities which when corrected would minimize their differences .",
    "the procedure is sensitive to a variety of contributions , including , those fixed on the detector plane ( such as pixel to pixel gain variation or the amplifier induced quadrants ) , those resulting from variation in the offset image light path ( such as filter density variations ) , those resulting from image evolution during the acquisition sequence ( seeing variations ) , and any others which are not stationary with respect to the solar image .",
    "the sensitivity to variation in atmospheric seeing during the course of the sequence is particularly troublesome , and a usable ` flat - field ' is not obtained daily .",
    "figures  [ fig0]@xmath10 and @xmath11 display , with histogram equalization of the intensity  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contrast images ( see below ) which are produced from the raw data using particularly poor flat - fields .",
    "the gain correction in ( @xmath10 ) failed to remove the amplifier induced quadrants and in ( @xmath11 ) introduced arc shaped defects related to the offset image positions in the flat - field algorithm .",
    "such flat - fields would never be used in the image processing ( figure  [ fig0]@xmath12 displays the image as actually processed for this study ) .",
    "all pspt images from the mlso are inspected individually using histogram equalization of the contrast intensity and , if necessary , reprocessed with a flat - field from a neighboring date until a gain correction is made which leaves no visible quadrant structure and no or few algorithm related defects in the image .",
    "this kind of inspection is capable of identifying defects remaining in individual images to very low amplitudes ( below 0.1% ) , but , since the flat - field image offset positions are a fixed sequence on the detector , defects remaining in the images below human visual acuity are the largest known source of systematic error in the data .",
    "we discuss these in detail in  4 .",
    "while the solar center - to - limb intensity variation and its possible temporal variability has intrinsic importance , reflecting the mean thermodynamic structure of the outer layers of the star , here we are interested in spatial variations ( in particular latitudinal variation ) about this underlying azimuthally invariant limb - darkening profile , and so must also measure it with precision .",
    "we employ a procedure which identifies quiet sun pixels in the image and performs a simultaneous least - squares fit to the intensity of these to determine the coefficients of a truncated series of legendre polynomials in radius @xmath13 and fourier modes in central angle : @xmath14\\ ] ] truncated to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are polar coordinates with the origin at the solar disk center .",
    "quiet sun pixels are taken as those within @xmath19 , in red and blue continuum , or @xmath20 , in caiik images , of the median intensity in about seventy - five equal area annuli centered around the solar disk center ( the annulus area is fixed so the number employed is slightly dependent on filter band and time of year ) .",
    "the orthogonality of the fitted functions allows capture , with little mixing , of both the solar center - to - limb variation and any residual dipolar ( linear gradient ) or quadrupolar ( quadrant structure ) artifacts present in the image .",
    "we note that , because the fourier phase at a given radius is independent from that at another , this formalism allows for the removal of a warped gradient or quadrant surface ( the fourier fit can rotate with azimuth at a given @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is a powerful tool in removing large scale image defects ( see  4 ) .",
    "we also note that the use of the contrast images @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the intensity measured at each pixel and @xmath23 is the fit to the solar center - to - limb variation and residual defects , in this study implies that the intensity measurements reported here are relative to a particular center - to - limb profile removed .",
    "that profile was calculated for a particular subset of quiet sun pixels in each image ( defined above ) , and other pixel subsets in the resulting contrast image will show center - to - limb brightening or darkening depending on their activity level in relation to those used to compute the center - to - limb function removed .",
    "we have selected fifty six of the best contrast image triplets from the mlso pspt image archive , spanning the period from march 2005 to july 2006 .",
    "the complete list of selected image triplets is given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "image quality was determined using two criterion : quality of the gain correction (  2.1 ) and atmospheric seeing conditions .",
    "seeing was estimated based on a measure of the red continuum solar limb width as determined from a gaussian profile fit to intensity values limb - ward of the inflection point in the four grid aligned directions from the solar disk center . only images with an average red continuum gaussian fwhm of less than 2.5 pixels ( limb width of 1.25 pixels ) were used in this study .    following selection ,",
    "each image was resized , rotated , and aligned to a common reference grid in which the solar p0 and b0 angles are zero , i.e. , the vertical image axes were aligned with the solar north - south .",
    "while these operations require interpolation ( bilinear used ) and thus introduce error , we have minimized the total impact by combining the procedures into a single interpolative step in heliographic coordinates .",
    "once aligned , the images can be used to construct averages and masks .",
    "pixel selection by masking ( here we define masking as excluding from analysis ) is based on using caiik intensity as a surrogate for the magnetic flux density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after sunspots and pores are masked out by thresholding the red continuum contrast intensity ( keeping @xmath24 ) , small magnetic elements show a strong positive correlation between caiik intensity and magnetic flux density , even down to very low intensity values @xcite . here",
    "we apply increasingly severe masks to the images , retaining only pixels in the analysis whose caiik intensity falls below the mask value .",
    "table  [ table3 ] indicates the mask intensity values used in this study , the approximate corresponding magnetic flux density ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the average ( over the image set ) percentage of pixels retained by each .",
    "masks range from very unrestrictive ( m0 retains all magnetic activity except sunspots and pores ) to very restrictive ( application of mask m6 or m7 yields images which retain only the very darkest caiik network cell centers ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the effect of applying masks m0 , m2 , and m6 to a subregion of a typical caiik image .",
    "we applied the eight masks based on caiik contrast values to the 56 contrast images at all wavelengths and averaged the unmasked pixels to produce mean contrast images at each wavelength and activity level .",
    "examples are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , where the average image ( after mask m0 application ) at each wavelength is displayed .",
    "the average activity over the nearly 17 months of observation is apparent as bright latitudinal bands across the caiik image disk and as limb - brightened faculae in the continuum observations .",
    "as has been previously reported for the declining phase of cycle 23 @xcite , hemispherical asymmetry in magnetic activity is clearly evident in these average images ( it is also seen in a more uniform sampling of the observation period ) .",
    "the continuum images also show a hint of the polar brightening which is the subject of this paper .    in next section",
    "we present results obtained largely from the application of masks m0 and m2 which separate plage / network from non - network contributions .",
    "mask m0 removes only sunspots and pores from the images while m2 masks out most network elements ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "preliminary results using the more severe mask m6 to remove all but the contributions from the darkest cell centers ( these perhaps representative of purely thermal emission from the non - magnetized photosphere ) are also presented .",
    "using the techniques described we have examined the latitudinal variation of the continuum photospheric intensity in pspt images . for each activity mask and wavelength , we have longitudinally averaged the mean contrast image over @xmath25 wide latitudinal bins .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . to be meaningfully interpreted , the variation with latitude must be compared with the longitudinally averaged center - to - limb variation ( clv ) of the mean contrast image ( as discussed in  2.1 the unmasked pixels show a clv relative to that already removed in making the contrast image ) .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ fig3 ] with solid curves .",
    "if no systematic latitudinal variation in mean intensity existed on the sun then the measured longitudinally averaged mean contrast would be the same as the longitudinally averaged clv .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "significant ( see  4 for discussion of noise properties ) variation in the longitudinally averaged intensity is observed with latitude .",
    "images weakly masked by m0 to remove only sunspot and pore contributions ( top row of figure  [ fig3 ] ) clearly show enhanced intensity at active region latitudes , as was already apparent in the full disk images of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the peak contrast intensities occur near @xmath26 latitiude at all wavelengths , with greater enhancement in the southern hemisphere than the northern .",
    "additionally , the images masked by either the m0 or the m2 mask ( middle row of figure  [ fig3 ] ) show evidence of polar brightening .",
    "mask m2 eliminates most magnetic activity over the solar disk ( only pixels whose caiik intensities correspond to magnetic flux densities of less than a couple gauss have been kept ) , and after application of this mask the images show an average @xmath27 enhancement in contrast in the polar region in both the red and blue continuum bands , slightly larger in the blue .",
    "the caiik contrast for this mask value shows no polar enhancement in the southern hemisphere but some in the northern .",
    "this is not yet understood .",
    "the observed polar continuum enhancement is likely not due to the presence of polar faculae .",
    "while these may contribute to the unmasked profiles of m0 , they are eliminated by m2 mask as their caiik intensity likely exceeds the @xmath28 threshold .",
    "this assertion is supported by the pixel intensity distributions ( figure  [ figh ] ) which show that the polar and mid - latitude distributions have nearly identical shapes , lacking the bright tail of the equatorial distributions .",
    "the polar distributions at all wavelengths are shifted as a whole to higher intensity values than their mid - latitude counterparts .",
    "this is in agreement with flux measurements using the solar distortion telescope @xcite .",
    "the lack of any bright caiik distribution tail , combined with the shift toward higher intensity in the continuum bands , suggests a thermal non - magnetic origin for the polar brightening . that the caiik distribution is also shifted likely results from the fact that pspt caiik filter is sufficiently broad to include a significant photospheric contribution .",
    "images masked by the even more severe m6 mask exclude all contributions but those from the quietest caiik cell centers .",
    "application of this mask is ideal for determination of the latitudinal variation in the thermal structure of the solar photosphere , as virtually all magnetic contributions should be negligible .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of remaining pixels makes this measure subject to large statistical uncertainty .",
    "the noise is largely of solar origin ( unresolved granulation ) and could be addressed with more data .",
    "this may be worthwhile , as the preliminary results presented here ( bottom row figure  [ fig3 ] ) suggest a hint of the expected @xcite increase in photospheric continuum intensity in both the polar _ and _ equatorial regions as compared to the solar mid - latitudes .",
    "if these increases are found to be significant after analysis of additional data , they would confirm a non - facular origin of the equatorial brightening @xcite , as all facular contributions have likely been eliminated by the severity of the m6 masking .",
    "an alternative way of plotting the latitudinal intensity variations ( to further distinguish them from those of the clv , and later in  4 from systematic error ) is to plot the contrast as a function of polar angle @xmath18 on the disk at fixed cosine of the heliocentric angle @xmath29 .",
    "since the sampling now occurs at fixed @xmath29 , the clv contributes a constant offset to the measurement ( independent of @xmath18 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig4]@xmath10 and @xmath11 present the continuum red and blue contrast intensities in this way after applying masks m0 and m2 , respectively .",
    "the average contrast values in a ring between @xmath30 and for @xmath25 bins in @xmath18 are plotted , scanning the solar limb counter - clockwise from the west ( right hand side of the image ) . in these plots",
    "the equator lies at @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while the poles lie at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the hemispherically asymmetric north and south activity belts are again apparent in figure  [ fig4]@xmath10 as increases in the red and blue continuum intensities either side of the equator .",
    "the polar enhancement is also prominent as are the darker mid - latitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig4]@xmath11 further confirms the polar enhancement .",
    "after application of mask m2 the polar intensity is about 0.15% larger than that at the equator in the red continuum ( @xmath36% greater at the pole than equator in the blue continuum ) .",
    "random fluctuations in the pspt images are largely granular in origin and thus of high spatial frequency , follow a @xmath37 reduction in amplitude upon image averaging ( when the images are separated by more than one granule lifetime ) , and are well represented by the error bars shown in figures  4 and 6 .",
    "those error bars indicate the maximum rms fluctuations about the latitudinal or @xmath18 bin averages for any of the data points plotted .",
    "the variations with latitude or @xmath18 measured are thus significant with respect to small scale random noise . moreover ,",
    "smaller subsets of the data images show the same underlying signal , albeit with larger amplitude fluctuations .",
    "the known systematic errors in the data behave differently .",
    "they are of large spatial scale and persistent with averaging , and thus pose the greatest challenge to the measurement .",
    "the dominant source of known systematic error is the presence of very low amplitude residual image defects which reflect the offset positions used in the  @xcite flat - field algorithm (  2.1 ) . since their location is nearly fixed ( somewhat smeared by the p0 and b0 correction during image alignment ) , they add upon averaging and are faintly visible in the continuum contrast images in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this section addresses and quantifies the level of uncertainty introduced by this source of error .    as discussed in ",
    "2.1 the pspt images are subject to two consecutive image processing stages , the first aimed at removing detector gain variations and the second , combined with the center - to - limb calculation , intended to remove residual dipolar and quadrupolar defects .",
    "this second step is necessary , not only to capture the faint defects described above , but also because the flat - field algorithm itself is subject to an intrinsic gradient ambiguity  @xcite and can thus introduce or fail to remove linear gradients in the image .",
    "the gradient is measured via the @xmath38 fourier component of the clv routine .",
    "we will see below that the @xmath39 mode proves useful in the further removal of the systematic defects .    in order to assess the efficacy of these techniques ,",
    "it is useful to apply them to those portions of the image which lie off of the solar limb in the same way as they are applied to the solar disk itself .",
    "this allows comparison between the systematic noise contributions to the image and the measured signal , since the signal should be absent off of the solar disk .",
    "while the standard pspt processing procedures correct for the detector gain variation across the entire field of view , they apply the legendre / fourier center - to - limb / defect correction only on the solar disk . in this section",
    "we thus employ a conceptually ( but not mathematically ) equivalent procedure which can be readily extended off of the solar limb .    after masking sunspot pixels",
    ", we divide the image by the median value of the intensity in very narrow annuli ( 1000 equal width annuli employed ) centered on the solar disk center .",
    "this very effectively removes the azimuthally invariant center - to - limb variation on the disk , while performing an equivalent correction off of it .",
    "fourier amplitudes are then calculated , fitting the pixels within each annulus independently with the @xmath40 expansion .",
    "the dipolar and quadrupolar defect correction is thus extended off of the solar disk .",
    "figure  [ syse]@xmath10 displays a single red continuum image processed in this way after histogram equalization of the contrast intensity . while the large scale defects contributing to systematic error in the analysis are barely visible on the solar disk , where real physical intensity fluctuations dominate the image and the error contrast is low , they are quite apparent as both residual quadrants and flat - field induced arc defects off the limb , where their relative contrast is high due to the low mean intensity values . figures  [ syse]@xmath11 and @xmath12 display the mean contrast , after application of masks m0 and m2 respectively , in two annuli ( on the disk _ solid _ curve , off the disk _ dashed _ curve ) as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "these curves are the averages of those obtained from the individual images after shifting appropriately for the solar p0 angle , and the off disk contrast has been scaled down by the ratio of the median intensity in the two annuli .",
    "the _ solid _ curves are equivalent to the red continuum plots shown in figures  [ fig4]@xmath10 and @xmath11 but without the b0 correction , and we note the very close similarity to those despite this difference and that of the underlying clv correction method .",
    "what figure  [ syse ] displays in addition to figures  [ fig4 ] is a measure of the systematic processing errors off of the solar disk ( _ dashed _ curves )",
    ". these are much smaller in magnitude than the measured signal on the disk suggesting that the measurement is not dominated by noise .",
    "since the measured polar brightening takes a @xmath41 form , it is important to ask if the fourier mode correction for image defects in fact spuriously introduces the ` signal ' being measured .",
    "figures  [ syse2]@xmath10 and @xmath11 plot the average contrast ( after mask m2 application ) as a function of theta after employing only the @xmath42 and @xmath40 corrections respectively",
    ". the amplitude of the polar brightening is reduced , not enhanced by the @xmath43 correction .",
    "it is also apparent that the @xmath43 correction further reduces the systematic noise off of the solar disk ( _ dashed _ curves ) .",
    "moreover , figures  [ syse2]@xmath10 and @xmath11 plot separately the contributions , both on and off of the disk , made by images with p0@xmath44 and p0@xmath45 ( _ dark _ and _ light _ grey curves respectively ) .",
    "this is a robust measure of the error contributions to the signal since any real solar measurement should be stationary with respect to this distinction . without the @xmath43 correction ( figure  [ syse2]@xmath10 ) the positive and negative p0 curves , from the data both on and off of the disk ,",
    "are consistently shifted with respect to one another .",
    "after application of the @xmath43 correction ( figure  [ syse2]@xmath11 ) the signals off of the solar disk remains consistently shifted , but those from on the solar disk do not .",
    "after the correction , the southern hemisphere signals for positive and negative p0 values show no or even slightly the wrong sense of shift with respect to one another , indicating that they are a property of the solar image and not a defect fixed in the detector plane .",
    "the signal in the northern hemisphere still appears to have some noise contribution , but at a much reduced amplitude .",
    "this is consistent with our experience with the images , which tend to show more defects in the northern hemisphere in response to the fixed flat - field sequence .",
    "we note that this test was also performed on subsets of the data , after selection of just the very best images , and while the random noise levels were higher , the polar brightening always stood out from the systematic error .",
    "moreover , annuli of smaller radius showed the same signal , albeit of decreasing amplitude as expected .",
    "we conclude that the fourier / legendre clv processing allows measurement of solar polar brightening at the very limits of the pspt capabilities .",
    "we have measured an enhancement of the photospheric continuum intensity in the solar polar regions using pspt images .",
    "we have carefully examined the properties of the signal and believe it to be of solar origin . moreover , the properties of the intensity distributions suggest that the signal is thermal not magnetic in origin , although contributions from very weak network elements associated with the pole - ward extending branch of the solar cycle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not be ruled out without processing significantly more data and employing masking of greater severity .",
    "this is planned , but limitations of the current ground based solar photometric observations may make a decisive measurement difficult .",
    "space based imaging photometry would be ideal for this and other intriguing problems .",
    "this is particularly true if solar cycle dependencies are to be uncovered .",
    "such measurements would help constrain global solar models by adding a thermodynamic constraint to the dynamical constraints currently provided by helioseismology @xcite .",
    "current numerical simulations seem to show little indication of a local temperature minimum at the equator , as our surface measurement implies , but rather display a mid - latitude minimum with a weak local maximum at the equator and stronger one at the pole .",
    "this is true even when a monotonically decreasing pole to equator profile is imposed in the solar tachocline @xcite .",
    "while we find some hint of equatorial brightening after application of our most restrictive activity masks ( bottom row figure  [ fig3 ] ) , it has extremely low amplitude and the measurement is extremely uncertain .",
    "our efforts can be distinquished from previous work in several ways",
    ". early work ( references @xmath46 in table  1 ) struggled with instrumental precision , systematic error , and detector gain correction .",
    "we too have taken pains to address these .",
    "more importantly , no distinction was made in that early work between magnetic and thermal contributions to the signal , other than perhaps qualitative selection of nonactive regions .",
    "we have emphasized this distinction by applying a series of masks based on caiik intensity to the images before analysis .",
    "previous efforts by kuhn et al .",
    "( references @xmath47 in table  @xmath48 ) have , for the most part , also attempted to separate quiet sun and facular contributions to the latitudinal signal .",
    "the approach in those studies differed from ours in that the facular contribution to the latitudinal variation was estimated statistically based on models of the quiet sun and facular color and intensity distributions .",
    "interestingly , the pole / mid - latitiude temperature contrast measured in those studies is in good agreement with our measurement .",
    "the previous authors , however , reported an additional low latitude brightness enhancement , only seeen very marginally , if at all , in our study at the most severe masking levels .",
    "we note , that the one measurement of solar latitudinal intensity variation available using spacecraft data @xcite did not remove the facular contribution during analysis . the latitudinal temperature profile obtained in that work looks very similar to our figure  @xmath49 , also unmasked .",
    "finally , we caution that our analysis does not completely eliminate possible contributions to the solar photospheric intensity from an abundance of unresolved magnetic elements of very low magnetic flux density .",
    "correlations between magnetic flux density and caiik intensity extend to very low values , making masking based on these images possible , but also suggesting continued contamination of the continuum measurements at very low contrasts ( rast 2003 ) .",
    "unambiguous measurement of a strictly thermal signal in the solar photosphere may require space - based full - disk photometric imaging at high precision and resolution over many wavelengths , combined with detailed modeling of the radiation field .",
    "even that effort may be stymied if in fact there is no quiet sun .",

    "<S> we have examined images from the precision solar photometric telescope ( pspt ) at the mauna loa solar observatory ( mlso ) in search of latitudinal variation in the solar photospheric intensity . along with the expected brightening of the solar activity belts , we have found a weak enhancement of the mean continuum intensity at polar latitudes ( continuum intensity enhancement @xmath0 corresponding to a brightness temperature enhancement of @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be thermal in origin and not due to a polar accumulation of weak magnetic elements , with both the continuum and caiik intensity distributions shifted towards higher values with little change in shape from their mid - latitude distributions . </S>",
    "<S> since the enhancement is of low spatial frequency and of very small amplitude it is difficult to separate from systematic instrumental and processing errors . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a thorough discussion of these and conclude that the measurement captures real solar latitudinal intensity variations . </S>"
