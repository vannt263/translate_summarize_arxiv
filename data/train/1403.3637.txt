    "two - level quantum systems ( qubits ) and quantum harmonic oscillators are the two most basic building blocks in quantum information science . stimulated by this , in the last decades there have been remarkable experimental progresses in the accurate control of the interaction in qubit - oscillator systems , including : trapped ions @xcite , cavity - qed @xcite , ultracold atomic bose - einstein condensate @xcite , quantum dots or cooper - pair boxes @xcite , superconducting qubits coupled to superconducting resonators @xcite , optomechanical systems @xcite , etc .",
    "furthermore , they have been investigated in different qubit - oscillator coupling regimes , including the recently so - called ultrastrong regime , where the qubit - oscillator coupling strength is comparable to the qubit and oscillator energy scales @xcite .",
    "in general , the quantum oscillator is modeled harmonically , however this is typically an approximation of more complicated scenarios .",
    "in fact , quantum nonlinear oscillators ( nlo ) have been implemented in several settings , including trapped ions ( where the trapping potential can be modified to include nonlinearities @xcite ) , optomechanical systems ( where tunable nonlinearities have been realized @xcite ) , and atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the inclusion of strong enough nonlinearities in the oscillator potential allows new possibilities to generate non - classical states @xcite . however , despite the promising experimental progresses in the control and fabrication of nlo , it is still a challenge to achieve significant nonlinearities ( for a more detailed discussion about the nonlinear regimes and their possible experimental implementations see sec .",
    "[ anharmonic potential ] ) .",
    "remarkably , we will show here that also weak non - linearities suffice to provide non - trivial and potentially useful features in the context of a qubit - nlo setting .    in this article",
    "we consider a quantum system composed of a qubit interacting with a quartic ( undriven ) nlo through a conditional displacement hamiltonian . in order to contrast our results",
    "when the nonlinearity is included in the potential , we first solve the simplest case , i.e. , a qubit interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator . in this case",
    ", the entanglement is generated periodically as a consequence of the superposition principle .",
    "first , by including a weak nonlinear perturbation in the oscillator potential , we have obtained analytically the wave function in the rotating - wave approximation  in a regime where both the qubit - nlo coupling as well as the nonlinearity strength are small compared to the oscillator frequency . in this case ,",
    "an explicit kerr - like term in the evolution appears , generating quadrature squeezing for short times . in particular",
    ", we will show that the entanglement generated in this nonlinear scenario is larger with respect to the linear case and , in addition , it dynamically reaches a stabilization region . for very large times",
    "the oscillator shows an intricate behavior exhibiting negative values in the wigner distribution .",
    "the second main result of this article is obtained by taking into account a strong qubit - nlo coupling , while still considering a weak nonlinear regime .",
    "the novelty with respect to previous works is the inclusion of the two- and four - phonon processes , i.e. the full numerical dynamics of the system without any approximation . in this case _",
    "i ) _ the entanglement stabilization region is achieved faster than in the weak qubit - nlo coupling case , and _",
    "ii ) _ the entanglement reaches its maximum value .",
    "finally , we have solved the markovian master equation , taking into account only the damping of the oscillator , and even in this case the system dynamics remains robust showing the main features just described for a considerable number of cycles .",
    "the article is organized as follow . in section [ non - dissipative dynamics ]",
    "we present the system under consideration for the non - dissipative case . in section",
    "[ without nonlinearity : exact solution of the wave - function ] we solve the system in the linear case for the sake of comparison with the results presented in section [ anharmonic potential ] where we consider the full nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we focus on two regimes : in subsection [ weakcoupling ] we consider the weak qubit - nlo coupling regime , in which an analytical approximation can be obtained for the dynamics of the system wave - function ; in subsection [ strongcoupling ] we show the full numerical solution for the strong coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , we present the case when losses are present in the system and suggest possible experimental implementations .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks in section [ concluding remarks ] .",
    "we consider a two - level system ( qubit ) coupled to a quartic nonlinear oscillator , as described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the free qubit ( nlo ) hamiltonian and @xmath3 is their mutual interaction .",

    "( [ ham ] ) the interaction strength is parametrized by @xmath14 ( assumed to be positive throughout ) and it is linear in the position operator @xmath12 .",
    "this type of interaction has been realized / proposed in various experimental settings  including ion traps @xcite , cavity - qed @xcite , and nanomechanical resonators @xcite  and its action can be understood as a displacement of the oscillator conditioned on the state of the qubit . as such , it has been exploited for example as a tool for reconstructing the state of quantum oscillators in various physical systems @xcite , or as a mediator to induce qubit - qubit interactions @xcite .",
    "let us notice that in order for the hamiltonian ( [ hm ] ) to be valid , in the following we will consider a modest nonlinear quartic perturbation . in particular , we require that @xmath15 during the evolution ( where @xmath16 is the average phonon number for the oscillator ) , thus ensuring that the single - frequency assumption for the oscillator ( @xmath10 ) remains valid .    introducing the usual annihilation @xmath17 and creation @xmath18 operators for the oscillator we can recast the oscillator canonical operators as @xmath19 rescaling eq .",

    ", the oscillator is entangled with the qubit  this hybrid entanglement reaching its maximum at time @xmath33 . in order to quantify the entanglement we use the negativity @xcite ( as we will eventually also compute the same entanglement when the oscillator is an open system , and negativity is a measure also valid for that case ) .",
    "the negativity can be computed as @xmath34    where the @xmath35 are the eigenvalues of the partially transposed qubit - nlo density matrix at fixed time @xmath36 .",

    "a similar dynamics has been reported in analogous optomechanical settings ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",

    "( [ negdelta0 ] ) is that the dynamics of each qubit eigenstate is linked to that of a coherent state during the evolution ( _ e.g. _ , the eigenstate @xmath7 is linked to @xmath44 ) . in order to better appreciate this behavior , as well as the oscillator dynamics",
    ", we have calculated the wigner function of the reduced density operator for the oscillator @xmath45 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ wigner_cycle ] we plot the wigner function of the reduced density operator for the nlo associated with the eq .",
    "( [ negdelta0 ] ) . as we can see , if the initial state is @xmath46 the oscillator s wigner function rotates in a larger circle with respect to the @xmath47 initial state .",
    "we will now derive the central results of this work .",
    "in particular , in sec .  [ weakcoupling ]",
    "we study the evolution for the weak coupling regime ( @xmath48 ) , where an approximated analytical expression for the wave - function can be obtained . in sec .",
    "[ strongcoupling ] we present the general results in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath49 ) , considering as well the detrimental effects of noise",
    ".      we will refer to the weak coupling regime when the rescaled qubit - nlo coupling strength is much lower than the qubit and oscillator free energies . in order to investigate the perturbation in the nlo we rewrite the quartic term",
    "as follows @xmath52 where we have emphasized the phonon process contributions ; namely , @xmath53 correspond to the operators identifying two- and four - phonon transitions and the number - state contribution @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "considering the commutation rule @xmath55 = 1 $ ] one obtains @xmath56 and the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "( [ happ ] ) as @xmath58 among the terms proportional to the nonlinearity strength @xmath59 , the oscillating ones can be approximately neglected .",
    "thus , transforming back to the schrdinger picture , one has the following hamiltonian : @xmath60    using the same techniques as before ( see appendix [ appb ] ) we obtain the following solution for the wave function , where we have neglected the terms proportional to @xmath61 ( for simplicity we have considered real amplitudes for the coherent state ) : @xmath62{\\left| \\uparrow \\right\\rangle}\\otimes{\\left| \\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\uparrow } \\right\\rangle}\\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hat{d}(-k)\\mathrm{exp}\\left[-6it\\delta(\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a})^2\\right]{\\left| \\downarrow \\right\\rangle}\\otimes{\\left| \\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\downarrow } \\right\\rangle}\\label{asmall}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath63    a comparison between the approximate analytical results in eq .",
    "( [ asmall ] ) versus a numerical computation using the full original hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hinicial ] ) is shown for short times in fig .",
    "[ n_small]-a , where we plot the negativity for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( for @xmath37 ) .",
    "as we can see , the analytical approximation agrees reasonably well with the numerical results ( the dotted line corresponds to the dynamics of the system in absence of nonlinearity ) .",
    "more importantly , the presence of a nonlinear kerr - like term proportional to @xmath66 represents a new source for entanglement and non - classical effects , allowing to grasp the main features associated with the full hamiltonian .",
    "the first of these features is the lack of a periodic behavior for short times which implies , in particular , that the entanglement does not decrease to zero .",
    "in addition , the actual values of the negativity show a clear _ enhancement of the entanglement _ with respect to linear case ( @xmath26 ) . remarkably , as shown in fig .",
    "[ n_small]-b , after few cycles the negativity reaches a plateau , implying a _ time - stabilization of the entanglement _ at values higher than the maximum attained for @xmath26 . for longer time - scales ( @xmath67 ) , the expected collapses and revivals appear only assuming both the rotating - wave approximation and small @xmath68 . on the other hand",
    ", the full numerical solution of the evolution does not show any collapse nor revival  in fact , the negativity never drops to zero .",
    "due to the establishment of a stabilization window , we can define the width of the time plateau ( @xmath69 ) as the region in which the negativity does not show significant oscillations ; e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ n_small]-b a plateau is approximately achieved for @xmath70 , being its width @xmath71 .",
    "the dependence between @xmath69 and @xmath59 eludes analytical calculations , however a straightforward numerical evaluation ( under the constraints of @xmath72 ) shows the dependence to be inversely proportional to the nonlinearity strength  in fact , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , one can show that @xmath75 .",
    "for the first cycle in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the sudden increasing in time shows the short period in which the squeezing remains valid .",

    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ wigner2d_small_k_delta]-a the wigner function for the nlo . for short times",

    "[ wigner2d_small_k_delta]-a shows the emergence of quadrature squeezing , with squeezing axes that rotate clockwise in the @xmath79-plane . defining two arbitrary canonical quadratures ( @xmath80 is the angle of rotation measured from the @xmath81-axis to @xmath76-axis ) @xmath82 we numerically find for each time @xmath36 the angle @xmath80 that minimize the uncertainty of @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 ) .",
    "the results are given in fig .  [ squeezing ] and quantitatively demonstrate the presence of squeezing for short times ( the results are normalized with respect to the coherent state uncertainty @xmath85 ) .",
    "another interesting feature is that whereas for short times the wigner function remains positive , for longer times it assumes negative values . interestingly",
    ", the appearance of relevant negative regions corresponds to the stabilization zone of the negativity  for example at @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ wigner2d_small_k_delta]-b ) .      in this section ,",
    "we solve numerically the full dynamics involving the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ han ] ) without restricting to the weak coupling regime . in order to do that",
    ", we have expanded the oscillator state in the fock basis , properly truncated to obtain a sufficient numerical accuracy .",
    "regarding the generation of entanglement between the qubit and the nlo , the effects of a strong coupling are that the two main features that we have individuated in the previous section are further enhanced .",
    "first , the entanglement negativity reaches higher values with respect to the absence of nonlinearities .",
    "second , the entanglement reaches the stabilization region faster then for the weak coupling regime .",
    "as an example , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ n_nonzero ] the negativity for @xmath88 , and two values for @xmath89 .",

    "this stability is sustained quite well in a window of time from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , after which it starts to oscillate .",
    "remarkably , in this regime the collapse and revival dynamics is entirely absent .",
    "the combination of a high amount of entanglement and the suppression of negativity oscillations provides a long time window in which the entanglement is maximal or near - maximal , in strong contrast to the linear case where maximal negativity is achieved only at defined times ( odd multiples of @xmath95 ) . here timing selection is no longer a concern in order to achieve high negativity , representing in turn a relevant practical advantage .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note in the subplot in fig .",
    "[ n_nonzero ] , that we have also considered the contribution of approximated hamiltonian regarding to only number - state contribution and up to two - phonon transitions in the dynamics ( see eq .",
    "as we can see in solid line , the full dynamics i.e including up to four - phonon transitions provides an entanglement plateau in time domain better than the other approximated cases .    in order to better understand the enhancement of the qubit - nlo entanglement we have calculated the wigner function of the oscillator state conditioned to the two qubit eigenstates @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) . in fig .",

    "the quasi - orthogonality is quantified using eq .",
    "( [ wp ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ wig_005]-c .    as before , we also calculated numerically the reduced density matrix for the qubit .",
    "in the presence of nonlinear coupling , the qubit exhibits an open cycle whose precession depends on the strength of the nonlinearity . for @xmath104",
    "the reduced qubit evolution tends to the quantum harmonic potential case , and therefore each cycle is closed . on the other hand , as @xmath59 increases",
    ", the qubit reaches a stationary point at times comparable to the entanglement stabilization region ( see fig .",
    "[ bloch_sphere_2 ] ) .    finally , we considered the detrimental effects of noise in the dynamics of the nlo .",

    "[ master ] we show the main effects of the losses .",
    "we can see that in the strong coupling regime the presence of the environment degrades the qubit - nlo entanglement but the main features observed in the previous sections are still present .",
    "in particular , both the enhancement of entanglement with respect to the linear case and the entanglement stabilization are robust for small losses .",
    "we have already mentioned some of the primary experimental setups in the introduction , let us now briefly examine some of those .",
    "the strong - coupling regime can be achieved using a qubit encoded in an electron on a quantum dot or a cooper pair on a small superconducting island , coupled to an oscillator consisting of a vibrating gate electrode . in ref .",

    ", they can reach substantial coupling in the range of @xmath107 mhz , and with the current technology @xmath108 can be performed .",
    "following with this regime , a qubit can also be modeled in clockwise and anti clockwise circulating currents in a superconducting loop .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors accomplish a strong coupling between a single electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen - vacancy impurity in diamond and the quantized motion of a magnetized nanomechanical resonator tip . here , the dimensionless coupling is approximately @xmath109 ( for further details related with the full set of parameters see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the weak coupling regime can be realized in systems where a quantum dot is coupled to a mechanical oscillator , where this resonator is modulated by changing the local lattice of the host material @xcite .",
    "another candidate setting for the implementation is given by trapped ions , where the strong coupling between hyperfine internal states of an ion and its motional degree of freedom has been shown in a variety of configurations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ion internal state can also be coupled to a cantilever under realistic conditions , for example , for a doubly clamped cantilever frequency of 19.7 mhz @xcite .",
    "the coupling strength which can be switched on and off for a cadmium ion is given by @xmath110 khz @xcite , and therefore @xmath111 .    concerning possible implementations of non - linear quantum oscillators ,",
    "various experimental platforms can be envisaged .",
    "as said , trapped ions can host qubit - oscillator systems .",
    "these platforms can also implement non - linear oscillators and in fact , by using a tunable set of parameters , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed how to encompass both linear and nonlinear potentials ( anharmonic and double - well)in order to achieve the efficient separation and re - combination of ions in surface ion - trap geometries using effective potentials .",
    "furthermore , nonlinearities can be generated as a result of static and longitudinal compressive force in suspended nanomechanical beams @xcite .",
    "for instance , for values of the length ( @xmath112 ) , thickness ( @xmath113 ) , and width ( @xmath114 ) of the nanomechanical beam in the range of @xmath115 nm , @xmath116 nm , and @xmath117 nm a nonlinear strength of the order of @xmath118 can be obtained .",
    "finally , nonlinearities can be achieved in a mechanical oscillator in the form of a nano - cantilever cooled to its ground state .",
    "there , a ferromagnetic impurity in the cantilever tip ( nano - magnets ) can induce non - linear potentials via high homogeneous external magnetic fields in helmholtz coil configuration @xcite ( for an overview of quantum mechanical systems see ref .",

    "these schemes points at the actual possibility of implementing the qubit - nlo coupling , being the non - linearity the most challenging task to achieve in an experiment .",
    "we have investigated a qubit ( spin ) coupled to a quartic nonlinear oscillator through a conditional displacement hamiltonian .",
    "the dynamics begins from a separable initial state composed of a qubit superposition state @xmath119 and a coherent state @xmath120 for the oscillator . throughout the paper we have used two relevant parameters , namely , the qubit - nlo coupling @xmath38 and the nonlinearity @xmath59 .",

    "the most interesting case corresponds to the _ strong coupling regime _",
    ", when we see that two- and four - phonon transitions play a relevant role both in the entanglement stabilization and in its enhancement .",
    "in particular , the entanglement negativity can reach its maximal value by virtue of the orthogonalization of the oscillator states relevant to the present dynamics .",
    "furthermore , solving numerically the corresponding master equation , we have shown that these effects remain robust to the presence of decoherence in the oscillator system .",
    "finally , we have considered in some details different possible experimental implementations for each regime considered here . witnessing this type of hybrid entanglement is a hard task , however following the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite we can give a full proof of the violation of a bell inequality for @xmath26 ( and for the weak coupling regime when @xmath122 ) .",

    "<S> while the entanglement generation is due to the conditional displacements , as noted in several works before , the suppression of its decay is related to the presence of squeezing and other complex processes induced by two- and four - phonon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have solved the respective markovian master equation , showing that the previous features are preserved also when the system is open . </S>"
