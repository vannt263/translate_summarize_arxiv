    "two ( or more ) celestial bodies which orbit each other will experience periodic deformations due to the fluctuations of the mutually attracting gravitational fields . the tidally induced flows in these bodies are subject to dissipative processes , causing a phase lag to develop between the perturbing potential and the displaced material .",
    "the resulting torque changes the orbital parameters of the system , and usually acts to drive the system towards circularization of the orbit and corotation of the components .",
    "if a binary system is in such a tidally relaxed state , it is relatively simple to calculate the tidally induced static shape of the components , the so - called equilibrium tide .",
    "however , in general the tidal deformation is time dependent and requires dynamical effects to be taken into account .",
    "cowling @xcite noted that the tidal forces can excite gravity ( g- ) modes in the radiative layers of binary stars , the so - called dynamical tides . in case of a high mass early type star",
    "the stellar envelope is radiative and gravity modes can be excited for which significant damping occurs in a layer beneath the stellar surface , where the local thermal timescale is comparable to the period of oscillation .",
    "zahn @xcite developed an asymptotic theory valid for low forcing frequencies where the radiative damping is severe and resonances with g - modes are smeared out .",
    "however , when the system is far from equilibrium , tidal forcing contains relatively high frequencies , so that resonances with relatively weakly damped low radial order g - modes are likely to occur .",

    "an implicit 2d hydrodynamics code has been developed @xcite in which centrifugal distortion is discarded , but which fully accommodates the arising coriolis forces in the rotating star . due to the coriolis force",
    "the response of a rotating star to a spherical harmonic perturbing force is itself not a simple spherical harmonic function , but may be numerically solved on a 2d @xmath2 grid . using the 2d - code , the effects of rotation on the stellar ( g-)modes can be examined , while also it is possible to study the stellar quasi - toroidal r - modes ( * ? ? ?",

    "the strength of the r - mode resonances , as given by the area of the peaks , becomes larger in a more rapidly rotating star . for rapid stellar rotation with @xmath4 ,",
    "the strongest r - modes have peak areas comparable to g - modes with approximately 710 radial nodes .",
    "additionally the long wavelength weakly damped r - mode resonances occur at quite low forcing frequencies in a region where the stellar g - modes are severely damped as a result of their short wavelength .",

    "such a system could be easily produced during the supernova explosion following a period of mass transfer from the initially more massive primary to the rejuvenated ms object @xcite .",
    "the energy and angular momentum ( magnitude ) of the eccentric orbit is given by @xmath9 where a is the semi - major axis and @xmath10 the mean angular velocity of the stars in their elliptic orbit .",
    "for simplicity we assume the stellar spin angular momentum vector @xmath11 to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector . in this paper",

    ", the @xmath1 ms star is exposed to a changing external gravitational field .",

    "[ fig : hansen ] we plot the hansen coefficients for @xmath36 as a function of @xmath33 for a few different values of the eccentricity .",
    "it is apparent that as the eccentricity increases , the number of contributing harmonics increases greatly , and also that the magnitude of the largest coefficients ( which enters the expression for the torque quadratically ) increases by a significant factor due to the diminishing orbital separation at periastron .",

    "the @xmath1 star is simultaneously forced at many harmonic frequencies @xmath52 ( in the stellar frame ) , the magnitude of each term being proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "the harmonic components with @xmath53 correspond to negative forcing frequencies which means that the corresponding frequency in the inertial frame is smaller than the stellar rotation frequency .",
    "hence in the stellar frame these components excite oscillations which run backwards .",
    "excitation of such retrograde modes gives rise to spin - down of the star , while excitation of prograde modes ( @xmath54 ) has the opposite effect .",
    "this opens the possibility of simultaneous tidal interaction with counteracting resonances with prograde ( spin - up ) and retrograde ( spin - down ) oscillation modes . by assuming the response of the star to the tidal forcing",
    "can be approximated by a linear treatment the problem simplifies considerably since we may apply the superposition principle and decompose the stellar response into independent harmonic components .",
    "we further assume the stellar response to each harmonic has reached a steady state in which the tidal excitation is balanced by radiative and viscous damping in the oscillating star .",
    "these approximations may break down during resonance passages although a steady state is usually a fairly good approximation , see discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the steady state assumption allows us to calculate the stellar response as a strictly periodic phenomenon , i.e.  we are not forced to follow the stellar oscillations on a dynamical timescale , which , at the current level and for the duration required to study secular evolution , would not be possible with present day computer facilities .",
    "the steady state tidal torque can be determined by applying the implicit 2d code mentioned above whereby the periodic term can be factored out . in paper",
    "i we have shown that for each harmonic @xmath55 in the forcing potential the work done by the tide ( per time unit ) on the star and the associated rate of change of spin angular momentum @xmath56 can be expressed as : @xmath57 whereby the torque integral is defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for imaginary part and @xmath60 is the associated legendre polynomial of index @xmath61 and degree @xmath62 . in steady",

    "a given forcing frequency @xmath65 ( in the inertial frame ) the tidal perturbation of the stellar mass density @xmath66 occurring in the above integral follows from the tidal response calculations in paper  i , see current appendix .",
    "conservation of energy and angular momentum then implies that the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum follows by adding up the stellar rates of change in response to each harmonic term in the tidal potential and then reversing the sign : @xmath67 by expressing the orbital eccentricity @xmath7 in terms of the stellar masses and the orbital energy @xmath68 and angular momentum @xmath69 ( * ? ? ?",

    "finally , the rate of change of the semi - major axis follows from @xmath73    by defining the eccentric orbit for given ( fixed ) stellar masses through @xmath24 and @xmath7 the tidal evolution of the orbit can be followed by numerically integrating eqs .",

    "to investigate the resonant exchange of energy and angular momentum in detail , we developed a routine that enables us to calculate this tidal evolution by interpolating the tidal torque integral ( [ eq : torqint ] ) , as a function of forcing frequency @xmath76 , stellar spin rate @xmath77 and evolutionary state of the ms star ( expressed in terms of the core hydrogen abundance @xmath78 ) in the data presented in paper  i and tables  [ tab : mmodes ] and  [ tab : rmodes ] ( see appendix for more details ) .",
    "we have seen that in an eccentric binary system the tidal forcing of the star by its orbiting companion occurs in a non - harmonic time dependent manner .",
    "decomposition of the forcing potential into harmonic components introduces a range of frequencies at which different harmonic modes of oscillation in the star are excited simultaneously .",
    "these forcing frequencies change as orbital evolution progresses due to the fact that the orbit may shrink or widen , and due to changes in the stellar rotation frequency . moreover , as the system evolves , the stellar oscillation spectrum itself changes due to restructuring of the star in response to stellar evolution and due to spin - up or spin - down of the star caused by tidal effects and the changing stellar moment of inertia .",
    "these stellar changes result in shifting of the eigenfrequencies of the stellar modes on the nuclear timescale of the star ( which becomes relatively short , with the possibility of rapid tidal evolution , near the end of core hydrogen burning @xcite ) . hence ,",
    "as the orbit evolves , the forcing frequencies shift through the stellar oscillation spectrum , picking up resonances in the star as eigen frequencies are crossed . during a resonance passage",
    ", the rate at which energy and angular momentum exchange takes place between the star and the orbit ( i.e.  the companion ) can be many orders of magnitude larger than in the non - resonant case .",
    "the total amount of exchanged angular momentum is obtained by integrating the torque over time ; since the speed at which the forcing frequencies shift through the stellar oscillation spectrum will generally be proportional to the torque , a relatively large peak area in the torque  frequency graph does not guarantee a large relative contribution to the tidal evolution process .",
    "the angular momentum exchange by a resonance passage of the @xmath64 harmonic component crossing resonance peak @xmath79 can be expressed as : @xmath80 with @xmath81 the torque integral  ( [ eq : torqint ] ) .",
    "the rate at which a certain harmonic component @xmath33 moves through the resonance with mode @xmath79 ( at frequency @xmath82 in the stellar frame ) is a function of the rate of change of the mean orbital and stellar angular speed and the rate of stellar evolution ( characterised by the rate of hydrogen depletion in the stellar core @xmath83 ) : @xmath84 after separating the dynamical and the stellar evolution component we obtain @xmath85    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_\\mathrm{c}}{\\mathrm{d}t } ,    \\label{eq : shift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 the stellar moment of inertia .",

    "( [ eq : shift ] ) is proportional to @xmath75 , the first term is , for given harmonic @xmath33 , fully determined by @xmath74 . of course the last term",
    "is determined by stellar evolution .      when a harmonic term @xmath33 of the tidal potential comes into resonance with a stellar oscillation mode the resulting exchange of energy and angular momentum between the ms star and its companion usually leads to a rapid shift through the resonance , so that the resonance condition is quickly lost and the tidal exchange is rather limited . however , under special circumstances , the resonance condition may be sustained for a relatively long period of time . a necessary condition for such locking on to a resonance",
    "is that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shift ] ) attains a small value during resonance passage while , in order to drive a significant orbital evolution , the acting torque should be large . substituting  ( [ eq : tlm ] ) and introducing the orbital moment of inertia @xmath87 , eq .",

    "a harmonic term in the forcing potential which has a small self - shifting coefficient @xmath96 must be driven deep into a resonance before its influence on the frequency shifting becomes prominent . if its self - shifting tendency draws itself through the resonance , the small value of @xmath96 results in a relatively slow resonance crossing with correspondingly enhanced exchange of energy and angular momentum . however , if the self - shift works in the direction opposite to the resonance crossing , the frequency shift ( due to the combined action of the other harmonics and the effect of stellar evolution ) towards the resonance peak may be halted , resulting in a locked condition .",
    "this locked condition , whereby the self - shift balances the effect of all other harmonics , may last for a long period , therefore the total effect on the orbit can be significant .",
    "the most efficient locking will occur when @xmath97 , i.e.for the tidal harmonic @xmath98 , which depends on the system s orbital period .",
    "the locking condition depends on the distribution of the hansen coefficients , i.e.  on the orbital eccentricity and on the location of the stellar oscillation spectrum relative to the locked mode ( on where the strongest modes are situated in frequency space ) .",
    "consider the common case where the @xmath64 harmonic @xmath99 approaches a resonance @xmath82 from below , i.e.@xmath100 whereby @xmath94 is slightly negative . assuming a ms star with prograde spin and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 denotes the division between retrograde and prograde harmonics , we can define @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 note that all harmonics with @xmath106 have @xmath107 , while all higher harmonics have @xmath108 , while the torque integrals @xmath109 for @xmath110 and positive for @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath111 ( but almost zero ) the @xmath64 harmonic tends to move away from the resonance at @xmath82 and must be driven into resonance by the combined action of the other harmonics ( which will interact with other resonances ) and the weak ( positive ) effect of stellar evolution : @xmath112 locking requires that , when driven deep into resonance , the @xmath64 harmonic begins to dominate all other effects , so that its action can prevent resonance passage : @xmath113 the criterion is easily modified for a retrograde stellar spin or for @xmath114 .",
    "we will meet several cases of resonance locking in the numerical results discussed below .",
    "from now on we express all frequencies in units of @xmath115 and note that we consider only the strongest tidal components of the companion s potential , i.e.   the component for which @xmath35 with either @xmath15 or @xmath36 . unless specifically stated , the initial evolution state of the ms star corresponds to a central hydrogen abundance @xmath116 .",
    "before we go on to the discussion of our numerical results , let us first express the rate of change of the orbital eccentricity ( [ eq : deedt ] ) due to the action of a single resonance , by substituting the corresponding expressions ( [ eq : tlm ] ) for @xmath117 and @xmath118 as : @xmath119 \\left ( n \\sqrt{1-e^2 } -m \\right )    \\mathcal{t}^{lm}_n \\label{eq : deedt3}\\ ] ] where the factor in square brackets is always negative .",
    "it follows that prograde harmonics ( @xmath54 ) would require @xmath120 to yield a resonant increase of the orbital eccentricity . unless the eccentricity is unrealistically large these two conditions are mutually exclusive , so that resonances with prograde modes tend to decrease the orbital eccentricity .",
    "on the other hand , retrograde modes which have @xmath110 and @xmath121 require @xmath122 to enlarge the orbital eccentricity .",
    "depending on the stellar rotation rate these two conditions can possibly be fulfilled , so that resonances with retrograde @xmath36 modes may enlarge the orbital eccentricity .",
    "given the large number of harmonics that appear in orbits with high eccentricities ( of the order @xmath123 for @xmath124 ) , the orbital evolution of such binary systems can be quite complicated .",
    "however , before we study the high eccentricity case , we will first consider the simple case of an almost circular orbit to gain some insight in the effect of resonances .",
    "first , we illustrate how the inclusion of resonant effects influences the tidal evolution in case of an almost circular orbit , so that we have to deal with only few harmonics .",
    "this we do by evolving a fairly narrow orbit ( @xmath125 days ) with eccentricity @xmath126 and a slowly rotating stellar component ( @xmath127 days ) until corotation and circularization is established , see fig .",
    "[ fig : evolecc ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolecc]e we depict the initial location ( frequency ) of the stellar @xmath41 modes in terms of the order @xmath33 of the forcing harmonic and indicate which harmonics have the largest hansen coefficients for this orbit .",
    "the @xmath15 modes play generally no prominent role in the evolution . for these low eccentricities ( @xmath128 )",
    ", we can use a low order expansion of the potential of the orbiting companion in powers of the eccentricity to analyse our numerical results .",
    "to first order in @xmath7 the hansen coefficients can be expressed as @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , yielding for the tidal potential @xmath133 note that the sign of the hansen coefficients is irrelevant since the tidal torque integral is proportional to the square of the coefficients .",

    "@xmath134 harmonic is by far the strongest for low eccentricities . during orbital evolution",

    ", the orbital period shows a small dip , mainly due to the @xmath138 resonance crossing . because the g@xmath136 mode is the lowest frequency g - mode considered here ,",
    "no further resonance crossings occur with the @xmath134 harmonic during the remaining orbital evolution . as the eccentricity drops during the orbital evolution , the @xmath138 hansen coefficient is further decreased and the following @xmath138 resonance passages induce little or no features in the curve of the orbital period . due to the off - resonant @xmath134 forcing frequency",
    "the star steadily spins up towards corotation .    for the @xmath64 harmonic the time evolution of the eccentricity  ( [ eq : deedt3 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath140 note that , initially , the star spins very sub - synchronously , so that the torque acting on the star @xmath141 for all @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath134 harmonic of the @xmath36 potential does not give rise to significant changes in the eccentricity of the orbit because its circularizing effect vanishes to order @xmath142 .",
    "it appears that the potential term with @xmath138 is responsible for the strongest circularization effect , while the @xmath46 component could potentially increase the orbital eccentricity of the system .",
    "however , whereas the frequency @xmath143 is so small that it does not cross any prograde resonance during the evolution of the orbit ( although it does cross the r - modes around @xmath144  myr ) , the @xmath138 forcing frequency starts between the g - modes with @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and passes through all of the modes g@xmath139 to g@xmath136 as the evolution progresses .",
    "due to the small ratio @xmath147 the total torque on the star is dominated by the off - resonant @xmath134 contribution even when the @xmath138 forcing frequency is close to an eigen - frequency of the star .",
    "therefore the rate @xmath148 at which the @xmath138 frequency shifts through the spectrum varies only little .",

    "we conclude that resonance locking might be responsible for the observed fast orbital decay in this system .",
    "we have studied the tidal evolution of eccentric early type binary systems by decomposing the time dependent tidal potential in a series of harmonics and by calculating the combined linear response of the uniformly rotating ms star with help of 2d - implicit code .",
    "we assumed the tidal oscillations to be in a steady state , whereby the tidal excitation is balanced by radiative damping .",
    "this allowed us to follow the orbital and spin evolution of the binary system in detail .",

    "the resonance crossing will be slower , as the tidal response is not yet fully developed .",
    "however , the tidal evolution is not expected to be much different from our steady state results because the real evolution timescale is still likely to be significantly shorter than the timescales associated with the other ( non - resonant ) harmonics .",
    "non - linear effects can become significant during a resonance crossing with a weakly damped mode and may give rise either to enhanced or reduced tidal evolution , depending on circumstances .",
    "but note that non - linear effects may often be of less importance because strong tidal interaction generally implies rapid orbital and spin evolution away from the resonance , so that the oscillation amplitude is already limited by linear effects .",
    "non - linear effects may influence resonance locking , whereby a harmonic remains near a resonance for a prolonged period of time .",
    "non - linear damping might lower the resonance peak height and might thus diminish to some extent the duration of locking .",

    "modes , see paper  i. these higher spherical degree resonances will add additional resonance crossings during tidal evolution although for moderate stellar spin rates the peak area of these resonances is much less than that of the @xmath35 peaks",
    ". however , since peak area is not important for resonance locking , resonance locking may be even more important than our calculations show due to the denser oscillation spectrum .",
    "our calculations indicate that the many forcing harmonics present in orbits with significant eccentricity give rise to effective tidal evolution . by taking into account not only the orbital evolution , but also the evolution of the ms star  especially of its rotation rate ",
    "the system progresses through many resonances with stellar oscillation modes , a process that drives itself .",
    "frequently conditions are favourable for resonance locking , whereby a particular tidal forcing harmonic is kept near - resonant with an oscillation mode for a prolonged period .",

    "<S> a high orbital eccentricity enhances the effectiveness of the tidal interaction because of the large number of harmonic components of the tidal potential and the reduced orbital separation near periastron . by including the evolution of the ms star , especially of its rotation rate , many resonance crossings occur with enhanced tidal interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the phenomenon of resonance locking whereby a particular tidal harmonic is kept resonant with a stellar oscillation mode by the combined action of stellar evolution and other tidal harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> resonance locking of prograde g - modes appears an effective mechanism for orbital circularization of eccentric orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the orbital evolution of the binary pulsar and conclude that resonance locking could explain the observed short orbital decay time of this system if the b - star spins in the direction counter to the orbital motion .    stars : rotation  stars : oscillations  stars : binaries : close  hydrodynamics </S>"
