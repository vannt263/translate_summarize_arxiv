    "one of the primary aims of the macro experiment at the gran sasso underground laboratories is the search for magnetic monopoles at the mass scale of grand unified theories ( guts ) of the electroweak and strong interactions @xcite with a sensitivity well below the parker bound ( @xmath46 @xmath47 s@xmath48 sr@xmath48 ) @xcite in the velocity range @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "macro has three subdetectors : liquid scintillation counters , limited streamer tubes and nuclear track detectors ( cr39 and lexan ) arranged in a modular structure of six  supermodules \" ( sm s ) .",
    "each sm is divided into a lower and an upper (  attico \" ) part and comes with separate mechanical structure and electronics readout .",
    "the full detector has global dimensions of @xmath51 m@xmath52 @xcite and provides a total acceptance to an isotropic flux of particles of @xmath53 m@xmath54sr .",
    "the detector has been built and equipped with electronics during the years 1988 - 1995 .",
    "data taking began in 1989 with the first sm ; since the fall of 1995 it is running in its final configuration . the response to slow and fast particles of the scintillators , streamer tubes and nuclear track detectors was experimentally studied @xcite .",
    "the three subdetectors ensure redundancy of information , cross - checks and independent signatures for possible mm candidates .",
    "the analyses presented here , based on the various subdetectors in a stand - alone and in a combined way , refer to direct detection of bare mms of one unit dirac charge ( @xmath55 ) , catalysis cross section @xmath56 mb and isotropic flux ( we consider mms with enough kinetic energy to traverse the earth ) ; this last condition sets a @xmath57 dependent mass threshold ( @xmath58 gev for @xmath59 , and lower for faster mms ) .",
    "since no mm candidate was found we quote new flux upper limits at the level of @xmath60 @xmath47 s@xmath48 sr@xmath48 for @xmath61 .     strange quark",
    "matter \" ( sqm ) should consist of aggregates of comparable amounts of @xmath62 , @xmath36 and @xmath63 quarks ; it might be the ground state of qcd @xcite .",
    "if bags of sqm were produced in a first - order phase transition in the early universe , they could be candidates for the dark matter ( dm ) , and might be found in the cosmic radiation reaching the earth .",
    "sqm in the cosmic radiation is commonly known as  nuclearite \" and  strangelet\"@xcite .",
    "q - balls should be aggregates of squarks , sleptons and higgs fields @xcite .",
    "they could have been produced in the early universe , and may contribute to the cold dark matter .",
    "heavy q - balls may have originated in the course of a phase transition or they could have been produced via fusion processes , reminiscent of the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "small q - balls could also be pair - produced in very high energy collisions .",
    "relic q - balls can be separated in two classes : supersymmetric electrically charged solitons ( secs ) and supersymmetric electrically neutral solitons ( sens ) .    some of the methods used for the mm searches may also be applied to search for nuclearites and for charged q - balls ( secs ) .",
    "we quote upper limits for @xmath64 .",
    "a flux of cosmic gut supermassive magnetic monopoles may reach the earth . the velocity spectrum of these mms could be in the range @xmath65 .",
    "our searches for mms exploit their energy loss mechanisms in each of the three macro subdetectors .    in scintillators",
    "the fraction of energy loss which is effective for the detection is the excitation energy loss which leads to the emission of light ; in streamer tubes it is the ionization energy loss in the gas ; in nuclear track detectors it is the restricted energy loss ( rel ) , i.  e. , the energy deposited within @xmath66 10 nm from the mm trajectory . in ref .",
    "@xcite a thorough analysis is made of these losses and of their dependence on the mm velocity .",
    "independent and combined monopole analyses were performed using the scintillator , streamer tube and nuclear track subdetectors in different ranges of velocity .",
    "as already stated the results presented here apply to bare @xmath67 mms and @xmath56 mb ; for the streamer tube analysis the dependence of the results on @xmath68 is discussed below .      the searches with the liquid scintillator subdetector use different specialized triggers covering specific velocity regions ;",
    "the searches are grouped into searches for low velocity ( @xmath69 ) , medium velocity ( @xmath70 ) and high velocity ( @xmath71 particles .",
    "previous searches using data collected with the slow monopole trigger ( smt ) and waveform digitizer ( wfd ) were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , see curves `` a '' , `` b '' in fig .  1 .",
    "a new custom made 200 mhz wfd system was implemented in 1995 which improves by at least a factor of two the sensitivity to very slow monopoles ( @xmath72 ) and by over a factor of five the sensitivity to relativistic monopoles with respect to previous conditions .",
    "the sensitivity of the smt / wfd was tested with led pulses , of @xmath73 @xmath74s duration , corresponding to @xmath72 , down to the level of few tens of single photoelectrons , which is the signature of a slow monopole . a waveform analysis procedure consisted in scanning off - line the corresponding wave forms and in software simulation of the function of both the analog and digital part of the smt circuitry on an event - by - event basis .",
    "we plan to report on this search in the near future .",
    "the data collected by the phrase ( pulse height recorder and synchronous encoder ) trigger are used to search for mms in the range @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the events are selected requiring hits in a maximum of four adjacent scintillation counters , with a minimum energy deposition of 10  mev in two different scintillator layers .",
    "events with @xmath76 are rejected because their pulse width is smaller than the expected counter crossing time ; events with @xmath77 are rejected because the light produced is much lower than that expected for a mm .",
    "the analyses refer to data collected by the macro lower part from october 1989 to the end of 1999 and also by the attico from june 1995 to the end of 1999 .",

    "only the horizontal streamer planes of the lower macro structure are used in the trigger ; the attico and the vertical planes are used for event reconstruction .",

    "both the physical process and the detector response were introduced in the code , taking into account the theoretical predictions on the cross section and on the decay channels .",
    "many samples ( each of 10,000 monopole events ) were generated with constant monopole velocity @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and with catalysis cross sections @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95  cm@xmath54 ( in the last two cases other samples with @xmath97 and @xmath98 were produced ) ; also a sample with no catalysis was simulated as a term of reference .",
    "these simulations were performed according to two different theoretical models for the catalysis cross section , one which considers it to have the same @xmath57 dependence for both protons and neutrons and a second one which assumes it to be @xmath57enhanced in case of protons .",
    "all samples were analyzed with the same program used for the real data .",
    "this allowed a study of the detection efficiency as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath68 .",
    "as a consequence new upper limits can be established which take into account also this process .",
