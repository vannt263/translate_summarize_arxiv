    "clarification of the mechanisms of fast magnetic reconnections in space and laboratory plasmas is a fundamental issue that has been tackled by plasma physicists for more than half a century  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the explosive release of magnetic energy , observed in solar flares , magnetospheric substorms and tokamak sawtooth collapses , indicates that the magnetic reconnections might further accelerate through nonlinear and nonequilibrium processes .",
    "it is widely accepted that the resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model can not reproduce such fast reconnection unless a locally enhanced resistivity is artificially introduced  @xcite .",
    "since the plasmas in these explosive events are relatively collisionless , the resistivity is thought to be physically less important than non - collisional microscopic effects such as electron inertia , hall current , ion gyroradius effects , and so on , which are all neglected in the classical mhd model .",
    "consequently , there has been considerable effort in recent years in studying a variety of two - fluid  @xcite , gyro - fluid  @xcite and gyrokinetic  @xcite models to understand reconnection in collisionless plasmas . until now",
    ", many simulation results  @xcite have shown that collisionless reconnection tends to accelerate into a nonlinear phase . however , the theoretical understanding of this process is very limited .",
    "the primary computational obstacle is that the nonlinear acceleration phase is observed only when the magnetic island width ( or the amplitude of the tearing mode ) exceeds the microscopic scales while sufficiently smaller than the scale of the equilibrium magnetic shear .",
    "this suggests the importance of making the microscopic scales as small as possible , yet affording very high spatial resolution to prolong the acceleration phase .",
    "consequently , it has not been clear in previous simulations how reconnection is accelerated and whether or not it is explosive .",
    "the nonlinear theory for explosive magnetic reconnection has remained elusive because of the difficulty of solving strongly nonlinear and nonequilibrium fluid motion with multiple scales .",
    "the method of asymptotic matching has been only applicable to linear stability of collisionless tearing modes , where the island width is assumed to be much smaller than any microscopic scale  @xcite . in the dissipationless limit ,",
    "recent studies take advantage of the hamiltonian structure @xcite of the collisionless two - fluid models  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the two - fluid effects distort the conservation laws ( frozen - in variables ) and hence permit magnetic reconnections with ideal fluid motion .    in the presence of only electron inertia in the two - fluid model",
    ", an ideal fluid motion develops an elongated current layer with y - shaped ends , where the layer width is comparable to the electron skin depth ( @xmath0 )  @xcite . on the other hand , even faster reconnections due to the formations of x - shaped current - vortex layers",
    "are observed numerically  @xcite when the effect of electron temperature is taken into account and the ion - sound gyro - radius ( @xmath1 ) is comparable to or larger than @xmath0 .",
    "this distinction between the y and x shapes seems to be crucial in determining the reconnection speed , in analogy with that between the sweet - parker  @xcite and petschek  @xcite models for resistive reconnections .",
    "although several pioneering works  @xcite have attempted theoretical explanations of the explosive growth of these nonlinear tearing modes , we note that their predictions are not in quantitative agreement with the high - resolution simulation results given in ref .",
    "@xcite and the present work .",
    "the goal of this paper is to clarify an explosive mechanism for collisionless reconnection caused by the interplay of the effects of electron inertia and temperature . to this end",
    ", we analyze the simple hamiltonian two - fluid model given explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , both numerically and analytically . in previous work",
    "@xcite , we considered only the effect of electron inertia and estimated an explosive growth rate by using a new variational method .",
    "this method not only gives better agreement with simulation results than earlier work  @xcite , but also gives a better physical interpretation because energy conservation is properly taken into account .",
    "here we generalize our previous study for the y - shaped layer and consider an x - shaped layer .    to be more specific",
    ", we will restrict our consideration to the case of @xmath2 , for simplicity , and shorten the scale @xmath2 as much as possible in the simulations .",
    "for the first time we perform simulations with @xmath3 and find that the x - shaped current - vortex layer widens rather locally around the reconnection point regardless of the size of computational domain .",
    "we show theoretically that this local x - shaped structure is nonlinearly generated because it is optimal for releasing the magnetic energy more efficiently than global structures .",
    "our variational method  @xcite is inspired by the ideal mhd lagrangian theory , in which the magnetic energy is considered to be part of the potential energy of the dynamical system ( in analogy with the elastic energy of rubber bands ) .",
    "if a fluid displacement continually decreases the magnetic energy , it is likely to grow by gaining the corresponding amount of the kinetic energy , and the most unstable displacement would decrease the magnetic energy most effectively .",
    "this argument assumes that the two - fluid effects are essential for changing the topology of magnetic field lines within the thin boundary layer , but their impact on the global energy balance is negligible in the limit of @xmath4 . by choosing a fluid displacement as a test function that mimics the local reconnection",
    ", we can estimate a growth rate for the displacement from the kinetic energy .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we first introduce a reduced two - fluid model  @xcite that includes the effects of electron inertia and electron temperature , and focus on a collisionless tearing mode that is linearly unstable for a magnetic shear @xmath5 in a doubly periodic @xmath6-@xmath7 plane , where the wavenumber @xmath8 is related to the aspect ratio @xmath9 of the domain . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , we present our numerical results on the nonlinear evolution of this tearing mode .",
    "explosive growth is observed when @xmath10 ( where @xmath2 and the tearing index @xmath11 is a function of @xmath9 ) .",
    "we will find that the explosive growth rate is almost independent of @xmath9 because , in the explosive phase , the x - shaped current - vortex layer expands locally around the reconnection point and its characteristic length in the @xmath7-direction is shorter than @xmath12 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present our theoretical model that explains the generation of such a local x - shaped layer . by replacing @xmath12 with a shorter length @xmath13 , we introduce an effective tearing index @xmath14 as a free parameter of the external solution and connect it to a novel inner solution that represents nonlinear evolution of a x - shaped layer .",
    "we will show that a local reconnection @xmath15 can transform the magnetic energy into the kinetic energy more efficiently than the global one @xmath16 . using this variational principle",
    "we estimate a growth rate for this local reconnection model , which is indeed explosive and agrees with the simulation results .",

    "we have investigated the nonlinear evolution of a collisionless tearing mode that can grow explosively with the formation of an x - shaped current - vortex layer due to the coexistence of electron inertia and temperature effects , where we have assumed @xmath2 for simplicity .    for the equilibrium state given in and the wavenumber @xmath8 ,",
    "the tearing mode is linearly unstable when the tearing index @xmath11 ( which is a function of @xmath9 ) is positive .",

    "more specifically , the amplitude @xmath93 of the displacement at @xmath92 exceeds @xmath1 and then grows explosively ; @xmath114 , @xmath115 . by observing this explosive phase in detail for @xmath308 , we find that the x - shaped layer widens locally around the reconnection point and its length scale ( @xmath309 ) seems to be unrelated to the wavelength @xmath12 ( and @xmath11 as well ) of the linear eigenmode .    to explain this locally enhanced reconnection , we have developed a theoretical model in which the magnetic flux @xmath40 is assumed to be conserved ( like ideal mhd ) except within the thin x - shaped layer .",
    "namely , the two - fluid conservation laws , are invoked only within the layer to obtain the matching conditions across it .",
    "the external solution is approximated by a linear tearing eigenmode that has a shorter wavenumber @xmath153 than @xmath12 and a smaller tearing index @xmath14 than @xmath11 .",
    "we have restricted our consideration to the range @xmath310 ( or @xmath311 ) , in which a simple expression @xmath280 holds and the length of the local x - shape ( @xmath309 ) is related to @xmath14 by . as shown in fig .",
    "[ regime ] , we have found that there are two kinds of scaling depending on whether the external solution is kink - type or tearing - type .",
    "the faster reconnection is theoretically predicted at the shorter @xmath223 , namely , at the lower bound of this range , @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 , which belongs to the tearing - type regime .",
    "the simulation results indeed agree with the tearing - type scaling with the explosive growth rate @xmath315 and they corroborate other properties predicted by this local reconnection model .    in comparison with the classical petschek reconnection model  @xcite in which the x - shaped boundary layer is composed of stationary slow - mode shocks , our model suggests that the x - shaped current - vortex layer is kinematically generated by ideal , incompressible and accelerated fluid motion in accordance with the two - fluid conservation laws and the energy conservation .",
    "the explosive growth rate with @xmath312 is moreover independent of the microscopic scale @xmath2 and hence reaches the alfvn speed @xmath316 at the fully reconnected stage @xmath317 .",
    "this is faster than the explosive growth @xmath318 that is caused by the y - shaped layer in the presence of only electron inertia ( see our previous work  @xcite ) .",
    "the two - field equations and can be derived from gyrokinetic and gyro - fluid equations by taking the fluid moments and then neglecting the ion pressure and electron and ion gyroradii  @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests our present results are a barebones model for fast reconnection , but further generalizations including the case @xmath319 are suggested for future work .",
    "the existence of more than one microscopic scale gives rise to nested boundary layers , as already known from the linear analysis .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of such nested boundary layers would be more complicated than that of the single boundary layer ( @xmath2 ) we have discussed . nevertheless ,",
    "if the outermost layer is sufficiently thinner than the island width and the energy balance is dominated by ideal mhd , we expect a similar x - shaped layer and explosive growth , since it is unlikely that any other structure can exist that is more efficient for releasing magnetic energy .",
    "unfortunately , present computational resources are not enough to observe the explosive phase for a sufficiently long period in the presence of the nested bounded layers .",
    "for example , when @xmath320 , linear analysis indicates that the innermost layer width @xmath321 is even narrower than @xmath0 and demands more computational grids .",
    "further advancements in computational performance and technique will be essential for studies of explosive reconnections in more general collisionless plasma models .",
