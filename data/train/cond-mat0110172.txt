    "statistical problems related to the diffusion of a single random walker in a medium with traps have been subject of intense research during the last decades @xcite .",
    "usually it is assumed that the statistical properties of this single ( @xmath16 ) random walker are representative of the statistical ensemble . however , there are multiparticle ( @xmath17 ) problems that can not be analyzed in terms of the single walker theory .",
    "an example is the number @xmath18 of distinct sites visited ( or territory explored ) up to time @xmath9 by @xmath0 independent random walkers all starting from the same origin @xcite .",
    "another multiparticle problem of interest , that as we will see is closely related to that of the territory explored , is the description of the order statistic of the diffusion processes , i.e. , the estimate of the time at which the @xmath6th particle of an initial set of @xmath0 particles all starting from the same origin is trapped .    the order - statistic problem when the traps are arranged on a ( hyper ) sphere ( i.e. , an absorbing boundary at a fixed distance )",
    "has been thoroughly studied @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the more difficult problem in which the traps are arranged randomly ( `` the trapping problem '' ) in a @xmath1-dimensional euclidean medium .",
    "a related problem , in which the @xmath0 particles are placed on the left of a one - sided random distribution of traps on a one - dimensional lattice , has been investigated in ref .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent advances in optical spectroscopy @xcite make it possible to monitor this kind of multiparticle dynamic process .",
    "indeed , the simultaneous tracking of @xmath19 fluorescently labeled particles and the analysis of the diffusive motion of the particles _ individually _ is a useful recent technique for characterizing heterogeneous microenvironments ( in particular for samples dynamically changing in time such as biological samples ) @xcite .",
    "an useful feature of the order statistics approach is that it allows one to infer properties of the diffusive system ( diffusion constant , number of diffusing particles , concentration of traps , effective dimension of the diffusive substrate ,  ) from only the analysis of the behavior of those particles that are first trapped .",
    "this could be an advantage when it is impractical or impossible to wait until all the reaction is over .",
    "the order statistics of the trapping process will be described by means of the probability @xmath20 that @xmath6 particles of the initial set of @xmath0 diffusing particles have been trapped , and the other @xmath21 have survived , by time @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we consider that all the particles start from the same origin which is free of traps .",
    "the moments of the time @xmath5 at which the @xmath6th particle of the initial set of @xmath0 particles is trapped will be calculated from @xmath20 .",
    "this probability @xmath20 will be given in terms of the survival probability @xmath22 that no particle of an initial set of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) has been absorbed by time @xmath9 .",
    "this last quantity will be estimated by means of the rosenstock approximation using expressions for @xmath18 calculated in refs .",
    "it should be noted that our approach to the order statistics of the diffusion process in the presence of randomly placed traps is different from that used @xcite for a fixed configuration of traps .",
    "what makes the two problems completely different , and hence the way of solving them , is that for the case with a given configuration of traps the probability that @xmath0 particles are trapped by time @xmath9 is simply the @xmath0th power of the probability for a single particle .",
    "this simplifying result does not hold when many configurations of randomly placed traps are considered .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ostp ] we deduce the main formulas that describe the order statistics of the trapping process : we relate @xmath20 to @xmath25 and @xmath15 to @xmath26 . in sec .",

    "[ sec : osra ] , where we also obtain asymptotic expressions ( the main term ) for @xmath29 and the variance .",
