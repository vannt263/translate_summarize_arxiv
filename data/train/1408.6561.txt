    "hawking investigated the radiation of scalar particles by black holes with the help of the wick rotation method @xcite applied for the gravitational collapse .",
    "his result is based on semi - classical calculations and the thermal radiation arises quantum mechanically due to a horizon of the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "thus , the field theory is quantized on the classical curved space - time background . tunnelling scalar particles via the spherically symmetric schwarzschild black holes",
    "was studied in @xcite , @xcite but without affecting the background .",
    "later the hawking radiation was considered as a quantum tunnelling effect near the horizon and shown that it exhibits a thermal spectrum @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such an approach explores the wkb approximation to evaluate the tunnelling probability trajectory through the horizon that is classically forbidden .",
    "this method was successfully applied to study black hole radiation for different space - times such as kerr @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the 3-dimensional btz black hole @xcite , @xcite , vaidya black hole @xcite , taub - nut @xcite , and gdel @xcite .",
    "the unruh temperature @xcite is retrieved for a rindler space - time @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a black hole can radiate particles with different spins at some temperature so that all kind of particles can be produced .",
    "it was shown that spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 fermions and photons can be created by black holes having the same temperature as for the case of radiation of scalar particles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "authors @xcite , @xcite have used the wkb approximation at leading order in planck constant @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the method of quantum tunnelling allows us to study thermodynamic properties of black holes and to understand the physical process of the black hole radiation .    to apply the tunnelling method one has to calculate the imaginary part of the action for the process of the emission through the horizon that is classically forbidden .",
    "such imaginary part of the action is similar to the boltzmann factor for the particle emission at the hawking temperature .",
    "one of the approaches to evaluate the imaginary part of the action is the null geodesic method developed in @xcite .",
    "the second approach uses the hamilton - jacobi equation that is the generalization of the complex path analysis @xcite .",
    "these two methods are based on the estimation of the tunnelling probability , which is the wkb approximation , for the classically forbidden trajectory via ( from inside to outside ) the horizon : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the classical action of the path at the leading order in @xmath0 . for the second method",
    ", one should explore the relativistic hamilton - jacobi equation to evaluate the imaginary part of the action of the emitted scalar particles .",
    "for the appropriate form of the action , one can solve the relativistic hamilton - jacobi equation and to obtain the imaginary part of the action .",
    "then with the help of eq.(1 ) we can calculate the quantum tunnelling probability .",
    "taking into account that a black hole possesses a definite temperature , we may obtain a temperature because eq.(1 ) is similar to the boltzmann expression for a thermal spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that a black hole can radiate particles with different spins and the emission spectrum of this radiation is similar to a black body radiation @xcite .",
    "the tunnelling method was applied for the emission of scalar , spin-1/2 , and spin-3/2 particles and photons . in this paper",
    "we use the tunnelling method to the case of the emission of massive spin-1 particles from non - rotating black holes .",
    "vector particles ( spin-1 bosons ) such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons are well - known and play very important role in standard model .",
    "therefore , it is naturally to consider radiation of spin-1 bosons by black holes . for simplicity we consider radiation of proca fields in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the probability of pair production of particles by the electric field ( schwinger s effect ) depends on the spin of particles @xcite .",
    "we want to investigate the effect of the black hole radiation for massive spin-1 particles and to obtain the radiation temperature and entropy .",
    "we apply a wkb approximation and the hamilton - jacobi ansatz @xcite to the proca equation and show that particles are radiated by the black hole with the same hawking temperature as in the case of scalar , spin-1/2 , and spin-3/2 particles .",
    "thus , the tunnelling approach shows that particles of spins @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are emitted at the hawking temperature . in our semi - classical calculations as well as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    "the change of angular momentum of the black hole is neglected due to the emitting the spin particles .",
    "this is a good approximation for black holes with the mass much grater than the planck mass .",
    "we claim that massive spin-1 bosons are also emitted at the hawking temperature .",
    "we use the system of units : @xmath9 .",
    "let us consider the black hole in @xmath10 dimensions with the line element as follows : @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we neglect the spherically symmetric 2-d part because only motion in radial direction is of our interest . the horizon in this space - time is in the point @xmath13 where @xmath14 vanishes ( @xmath15 ) . near the horizon",
    ", we have @xmath16 $ ] . the proca equations for vector particles",
    "are given by ( see @xcite where some aspects of the proca equations are described ) @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 are covariant derivatives , and @xmath21 . from eqs.(3 ) one obtains the equation for the metric ( 2 ) as follows : @xmath22 which is equivalent to the system of two second order equations @xmath23+\\frac{m^2}{\\hbar^2}\\psi_0=0,\\ ] ] @xmath24 @xmath25+\\frac{m^2}{\\hbar^2}\\psi_1=0.\\ ] ] with the help of the wkb approximation , we look for solutions to eqs.(5 ) in the form @xmath26 where the action is given by @xmath27 replacing eqs.(6),(7 ) into eqs.(5 ) , in the leading order to @xmath0 , one obtains equations as follows : @xmath28+m^2c_0=0,\\ ] ] @xmath29 @xmath30+m^2c_1=0.\\ ] ] the solution to eqs.(8 ) can be obtained in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an energy and @xmath33 is a ( complex ) constant . replacing eq.(9 ) into eqs.(8 ) we obtain the matrix equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 . matrix equation ( 10 )",
    "possesses the nontrivial solution if the determinant of the matrix in eq.(10 ) equals zero .",
    "then we find @xmath36 from eq.(11 ) one obtains @xmath37 the signs in the square root are connected to the outgoing ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) or ingoing ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) motion of particles . here",
    "we consider a path in the direction @xmath42 from the inside to the outside of the horizon which corresponds to expression ( 12 ) with the sign @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 has a simple pole at the horizon . in the regions @xmath45 and @xmath46 the integral in eq.(12 ) is well defined and real , but if the path goes via the point @xmath47 the integral is not defined as @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "to calculate the integral for crossing the horizon @xmath47 , one can use a replacement @xmath50 for outgoing particles @xcite .",
    "thus , we specify the complex contour which can be used for the evaluating the integral around @xmath13 .    the probability is normalized if im@xmath33=-im@xmath40 @xcite and there is an absorbtion and no a reflection .",
    "an imaginary part of @xmath33 appears for schwarzschild and other coordinates which are not well - defined across the horizon .",
    "thus , one needs for an imaginary part of @xmath33 , that can be considered as boundary conditions , in our case of singular coordinate systems .",
    "it was mentioned in @xcite that black holes may be created by classical collapse , but their disintegration is a quantum phenomenon .",
    "one can calculate the imaginary part of the integral ( 12 ) by the formula @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the principal value of @xmath53 . as a result ,",
    "the probability of tunnelling a particle from inside to outside the horizon is @xmath54 the important step is to take into account that the classical absorption probability is unity . from eq.(14 )",
    "we obtain the temperature @xmath55 thus , a temperature is associated with the horizon .",
    "expression ( 15 ) holds also for the black hole emission of particles with spins @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the same result is valid also for spin-1 bosons in ( @xmath56 ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "the generalization to ( @xmath57 ) dimensions is straightforward .      for the schwarzchild black hole formed due to gravitational collapse of the matter , which is asymptotically flat , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is a mass of the black hole , @xmath60 , and",
    "the event horizon is at @xmath61 ) . in this case",
    "an observer at @xmath62 detects the radiation at late times @xmath63 compared with early times near the horizon @xmath64 .",
    "this radiation , obtained from eqs.(14),(15 ) , possesses hawking s temperature @xmath65 and we verify the hawking thermal formula . for the de sitter space - time @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the hubble parameter ,",
    "@xmath68 is a scale factor , and the event horizon takes place at @xmath69 ) , and from eq.(15 ) we find the temperature @xmath70 . for the rindler space - time @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is an acceleration ) and the temperature , obtained from eqs.(14),(15 ) , becomes the unruh temperature @xmath73 .",
    "the temperatures for these cases are determined by the horizons .",
    "thus , the expression ( 15 ) can be used for evaluating the temperature for different metrics .",
    "let us consider the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time with the function @xmath74 here @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a cosmological constant .",
    "this space - time can possess two horizons corresponding to the solution of the equation @xmath77 .",
    "we note that for @xmath78 there are three real roots with the link @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , only positive ( two or one ) roots correspond to event horizons .",
    "we find @xmath80 where for @xmath81 roots are given by @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus the root @xmath84 is negative and does not have physical meaning because @xmath85 , but @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) correspond to black hole event horizon and the cosmological horizon , respectively .",
    "we imply that particles cross two horizons .",
    "for the particle emissions the contour in eq.(12 ) belongs the upper complex plane . from eqs.(16)-(18 ) we obtain @xmath89 then from eqs.(12),(13),(19 ) , one finds @xmath90 from eqs.(14),(20 ) and the boltzmann expression we obtain the emission temperature for the general case of event and cosmological horizons @xmath91 it should be noted that simple expression ( 21 ) obtained is different from one given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath92 versus @xmath93.,width=384,height=384 ]    also the temperature ( 21 ) corresponding to two horizons is not the sum of two temperatures associated with event and cosmological horizons . if two horizons coincides , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and we recover the nariai @xcite temperature @xmath96 the plot of the function @xmath92 versus @xmath93 is given in fig.1 .",
    "now we calculate the thermodynamical entropy of a black hole when there are two horizons with unequal surface gravity . for a given temperature within classical thermodynamics one can use the change in the entropy as follows : @xmath97 . after integrating this equation",
    "we can calculate the function s(e ) up to an additive constant .",
    "one can assume that for the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time an energy equals the mass of the black - hole ( @xmath98 ) @xmath99 .",
    "thus , to obtain the entropy of the black - hole we explore the relation @xmath100 integrating the equation ( 22 ) for schwarzschild space - time leads to correct hawking entropy ( @xmath101 ) @xmath102 .",
    "replacing the temperature ( 21 ) into eq.(22 ) , we obtain @xmath103 after integration , we find entropy of a black hole for schwarzschild - de sitter space - time @xmath104+c . \\label{24}\\ ] ] an additive constant @xmath33 can be determined from an additional consideration .",
    "the plot of the function @xmath105 versus @xmath93 ( @xmath75 ) for @xmath106 is given in fig .",
    "2 . for nariai space - time , @xmath107",
    ", we obtain entropy @xmath108 we suppose that the constant @xmath106 .",
    "the function @xmath105 versus @xmath93 ( c=0).,width=384,height=384 ]    it should be mentioned that there is a discussion of different expressions for temperature and entropy for schwarzschild - de sitter space - time in literature @xcite , @xcite . as a result , at present time , all expressions for temperature and entropy for schwarzschild - de sitter space - time are questionable .",
    "we imply that formulas for temperature ( 21 ) and entropy ( 24 ) for schwarzschild - de sitter space - time ( at @xmath106 ) hold also for ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions for any spins .",
    "it was demonstrated with the help of the quantum tunnelling method that the hawking temperature takes place for black holes emission of vector bosons due to the presence of the horizon .",
    "we have obtained the temperature and entropy for the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time with two horizons ( event and cosmological ) , eqs.(21 ) , ( 24 ) , that is our main result .",
    "the plots of the functions @xmath109 and @xmath2 versus the mass of black hole @xmath59 are given in figures 1 , 2 , respectively .",
    "for a particular case we found temperature and entropy of a black hole for nariai space - time .    to calculate the radiation from evaporating black holes the bogoliubov transformations can be used @xcite .",
    "but the tunnelling method is simpler and can be applied for a variety of metrics for different spin particles . it should be noted that we consider here only eternal black holes , which gives gravitational backgrounds .",
    "evaluating corrections to the tunnelling probability using the conservation of energy can solve the information paradox @xcite which claims that information can be lost in a black hole , so that different physical states can present in the final state .",
    "but the information loss is in the contradiction with the conservation of information and entropy .",
    "it should be noted that a thermal spectrum is inconsistent with the energy conservation because the background geometry is fixed .",
    "one may compute corrections to the emission temperature by taking into consideration of higher orders in wkb . as a result , taking into account energy conservation @xcite during the emission of particles through tunnelling via the horizon and back - reaction effects @xcite",
    ", one obtains non - thermal corrections to the black - hole radiation spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath110 correction to the boltzmann expression arises from the energy conservation @xcite and the spectrum is not precisely thermal .",
    "non - thermality gives correlations in the radiation having the information .",
    "the correlations between hawking radiations result in the amount of information contained in this correlation which equals to the information loss paradox @xcite .",
    "thus , the statement that the information is lost during black hole evaporation is based on the assumption of thermality of the spectrum .",
