    "in the post wmap era for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements and in preparation of planck and the post - planck era , attention is now shifting towards small angular scales of the order of a few arc - minutes or even smaller . at these scales , cmb temperature and polarisation fluctuations",
    "are no longer dominated by primary effects at the surface of last scattering but rather by the so - called secondary effects induced by the interaction of cmb photons with the matter in the line of sight .",
    "current and future cmb experiments have two main goals : i ) measuring small angular scale temperature fluctuations ( below a few arc minutes ) , and ii ) measuring the cmb polarisation power spectrum .",
    "these goals are fundamental for our understanding of the universe .",
    "the small - scale anisotropies are directly related to the presence of structures in the universe whereas the two types of polarisation ( @xmath0 and @xmath1-modes , which we discuss later ) probe both the reionisation of the universe , i.e. the formation of the first emitting objects , and the inflationary potential . in this review ,",
    "we focus on the end of the dark ages and the astrophysical probes of reionisation",
    ".    there have been rapid and important advances in the recent past .",
    "we already have on the one hand measurements , by acbar , cbi , bima , vsa , of the temperature power spectrum for @xmath2 with cbi and bima data showing an excess of power as compared with the predicted damping tail of the cmb ( figure  [ fig : high - l ] ) . on the other hand , dasi , archeops , boomerang , maxipol , cbi , quad and wmap have direct measurements of the @xmath0-mode polarisation .",
    "the situation will change even more in the near future with anticipated results from experiments currently taking data or in preparation ( quad , bicep , ebex , clover , quiet , spider , planck ) .",
    "all of this experimental activity is motivated by what now amounts to the standard model of cosmology .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations which are generated prior to decoupling are measured on scales from 90 degrees to several arc minutes .",
    "this has led to a model of precision cosmology .",
    "the basic infrastructure is the friedmann - lemaitre model with zero curvature , a cosmological constant ( or dark energy ) , a baryonic content and non - baryonic dominant cold dark matter component ( with fractions given by the recent wmap data ( spergel et al .",
    "superimposed on the cosmological background are the primordial adiabatic density fluctuations , described by a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath3 at horizon crossing ( in the comoving gauge ) , that generated the large - scale structure via gravitational instability of the cold matter component .",
    "however it has become increasingly apparent that to further refine these parameters , and to face the more intriguing challenge of establishing possible deviations from the concordance model one has to address the degeneracies between cosmological parameters with those from the secondary anisotropies as well as the extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "the primary cmb anisotropies are due to the gravitational redshift at large angular scales ( sachs & wolfe 1967 ) and to the evolution of the primordial photon - baryon fluid evolution under gravity and compton scattering at lower scales ( silk 1967 , peebles & yu 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) to which one adds photon diffusion damping at small scales ( silk 1967 ) .",
    "primary fluctuations have provided us with an unparalleled probe of the primordial density fluctuations that seeded large - scale structure formation . indeed on large angular scales , greater than the angular scale subtended by the sound horizon at recombination",
    ", one can directly view the approximately scale - invariant spectrum of primordial quantum fluctuations .    on their way towards us ,",
    "the photons interact with cosmic structures and their frequency , energy or direction of propagation are affected .",
    "these are the secondary effects that involve the density and velocity fields and incorporate compton scattering off electrons .",
    "this review is devoted to a study of these secondary anisotropies .",
    "the cmb photons we observe today have traversed the universe from the last scattering surface to us and have thus interacted with matter along their path through the universe .",
    "these interactions generate the secondary anisotropies that arise from two major families of interactions .",
    "the first family includes the gravitational effects ( figure [ fig : sectot ] panel a ) , including gravitational lensing , the rees - sciama effect ( rs ) , moving lenses and decaying potentials usually referred to as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) .",
    "these anisotropies arise from the interactions of the photons with gravitational potential wells .",
    "the second family incorporates the effects of scattering between cmb photons and free electrons ( figure [ fig : sectot ] panel b ) such as inverse compton interaction ( the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ) and velocity - induced scatterings such as the ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect and inhomogeneous reionisation .",
    "we define secondary anisotropies in the cmb to include all temperature fluctuations generated since the epoch of matter - radiation decoupling at @xmath4 the following contributions may be distinguished .    1 .",
    "the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect is due to cmb photons traversing a time - varying linear gravitational potential .",
    "the relevant scale is the curvature scale freeze - out in concordance cosmology : the horizon at @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to an angular scale of about 10@xmath6 .",
    "the rees - sciama ( rs ) effect is due to cmb photons traversing a non - linear gravitational potential , usually associated with gravitational collapse .",
    "the relevant scales are those of galaxy clusters and superclusters , corresponding to angular scales of 5 - 10 arc minutes .",
    "gravitational lensing of the cmb by intervening large - scale structure does not change the total power in fluctuations , but power is redistributed preferentially towards smaller scales .",
    "the effects are significant only below a few arc minutes .",
    "its effects may be significant on large scales when the observable of interest is the @xmath1-mode power spectrum .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect from hot gas in clusters is due to the first order correction for energy transfer in thomson scattering .",
    "it is on the scale of galaxy clusters and superclusters , although it may be produced on very small scales by the first stars in the universe .",
    "there is a spectral distortion , energy being transferred from photons in the rayleigh - jeans tail of the cosmic blackbody radiation to the wien tail .",
    "the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect is the doppler effect due to the motion of hot gas in clusters that scatters the cmb .",
    "it causes no spectral distortion .",
    "the ostriker - vishniac ( ov linear ) effect is also due to doppler boosting .",
    "it is the linear version of the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "it is proportional to the product of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is effective on the scale of order 1 arc minute .",
    "discrete sources provide an appreciable foreground , especially at lower frequencies for radio sources and high frequencies for infra - red and submillimetre sources .",
    "polarisation is primarily a secondary phenomenon .",
    "the primary effect from last scattering is induced by out - of - phase velocity perturbations and provides evidence for the acausal nature of the fluctuations .",
    "the secondary polarisation is associated with the reionisation of the universe and is on large scales corresponding to the horizon at reionisation .",
    "inhomogeneous reionisation and scattering at the galaxy cluster scale leads to smaller scale polarisation .",
    "the reionisation signal is weak , amounting to no more than 10 percent of the primary signal .",
    "@xmath1-mode polarisation can be induced by shear perturbations .",
    "one source is gravitational lensing of primary cmb fluctuations .",
    "a second is relic gravity waves from inflation .",
    "these are pure @xmath1-modes , and fall off rapidly on scales smaller than the horizon at recombination , corresponding to about half a degree .",
    "mixing by faraday rotation in the intracluster medium also contributes to @xmath1-mode generation on small angular scales .",
    "the @xmath1-mode polarisation amplitude only amounts to about a percent of the primary signal , and its discovery will pose the major challenge for future experiments .",
    "in dealing with secondary cmb anisotropies at reionisation or arising from ionised structure like the hot gas in galaxy clusters , we are concerned with the scattering of the cmb photons by the plasma .",
    "a specific example of this is the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , which is discussed in detail in section @xmath9 , where the intra - cluster gas up - scatters the cold microwave photons .    since the secondary anisotropies are distortions of the cmb , which is the radiation field , we start by looking at the properties of an isotropic and thermal radiation background .",
    "the distribution function , @xmath10 t ) , of any radiation field is defined such that @xmath11 is the number of photons in the real space volume @xmath12 about * r * and the momentum space volume @xmath13 about * p*@xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the frequency ) at time @xmath16 with polarisation @xmath17 .",
    "this distribution can be related to the photon occupation number , @xmath18 t ) , by n _ ( _ , ) = h^3f _ ( _ , ) . for polarisation a description in terms of the pure polarisation states pre - supposes fully polarised radiation . for cmb radiation",
    ", the occupation number has a planckian distribution given by n_= ( e^h_pl / -1 ) ^-1 for  = 1,2  , [ eq : planckdist ] where is the temperature of the cmb photons .",
    "the specific intensity of radiation is related to the distribution function by i_(*k*,*r*,t ) = _ = 1 ^ 2 ( h_pl^4 ^3 c^2 ) f_(*r*,*p*_,t )  .",
    "commonly , the specific intensity is described in units of brightness temperature , @xmath19 , which is defined as the temperature of the thermal radiation field which in the rayleigh - jeans ( r - j ) limit ( , low frequency ) would have the same brightness as the radiation that is being described . in the r - j limit",
    ", the specific intensity reduces to @xmath20 , so that t_r - j ( ) = c^2 i_2 ^2 .",
    "now let us consider the scattering between two species ( namely photons and electrons ) .",
    "for an ensemble of particles , if the motion of one particle is completely independent of all other particles , then to describe the state of the particles , one can specify the single particle distribution function given by @xmath21 , which is the probability of finding a single particle in the phase space volume @xmath22 around the point ( * r , p * ) at time @xmath16 .",
    "if there are no interactions between the particles and if they are non - relativistic , then the distribution obeys the liouville equation = ft+*p*m.f + f(*r , p*,t).f , [ eq : liouville ] where @xmath23 is any force that may be present , and @xmath24 is the mass of a particle , assumed to be the same for all particles .    in the case of inter - particle interactions being random and statistical in nature",
    ", one can not describe the system by a mean force @xmath23 , but one has to consider instantaneous collisions between the particles ( this is the case for photon - electron interactions ) .",
    "these collisions will remove particles from ( or add particles to ) a cell in phase - space .",
    "if one carefully balances these changes of particles in each cell , then for non - relativistic elastic collisions , one ends up with the boltzmann equation @xmath25 d^3*p*_1|*p - p*_1|mddd , [ eq : boltzman ] where the scattering solid angle @xmath26 is determined by the conservation of momentum and energy and @xmath27 is the scattering cross section .",
    "moreover , the collisions take place between particles with momenta @xmath28 and @xmath29 and produced particles with momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the boltzmann equation ,",
    "being integro - differential , is difficult to solve analytically .",
    "however , it can be tackled under some approximations which can be made when @xmath32 is close to @xmath30 and @xmath29 is close to @xmath33 .",
    "it is then possible to expand the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : boltzman ] ) in powers of @xmath34 and carry out the integral .",
    "the result can be expressed in terms of a taylor series to give the fokker - planck equation .",
    "a simplification of the fokker - planck equation yields the kompaneets equation , whose solution for the case of photon - electron collisions in astrophysical situations gives the sunyaev - zeldovich distortion ( section @xmath9 ) .    at matter - radiation decoupling , the free electrons are non - relativistic and the scattering between them and the photons is simply thomson scattering .",
    "the incident electromagnetic radiation with linear polarisation @xmath35 is scattered by an electron at rest in a radiation field of polarisation @xmath36 into a solid angle @xmath37 with a probability : @xmath38 in the plane perpendicular to the scattering direction there is no variation of the polarisation . in the scattering plane , however , there is a net polarisation . as a consequence ,",
    "if the incident radiation propagating along the @xmath39 axis comes from two orthogonal directions there will be no polarisation transmitted along the @xmath39 axis .",
    "isotropic non - polarised incident radiation will induce the same identical polarisation along @xmath40 and @xmath41 axis .",
    "if the incident radiation is anisotropic and quadrupolar the scattered radiation shows an excess of energy and thus a non - zero polarisation oriented according to the quadrupole orientation . as a result , the thomson scattering induces a linear polarisation under the condition that the incident radiation has at least a quadrupolar geometry . in the cosmological context , anisotropies are induced by density perturbations and the velocity gradients are responsible for the quadrupole moment .",
    "we therefore expect a thomson scattering - induced polarisation for the primary anisotropies .",
    "the polarisation intensity is governed by the boltzmann equation ( peebles & yu 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 , bond & efstathiou 1984 , ma & bertschinger 1995 , hu & white 1997 ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the two stokes parameters , @xmath45 is the conformal time , @xmath46 is the expansion factor , and @xmath47 the direction of photon propagation .",
    "@xmath48 are the spherical harmonics with spin - weight @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is defined in terms of the quadrupole components of the temperature ( @xmath51 ) and polarisation perturbations @xmath52 @xmath53 is the comoving coordinate . in equation [ eq : bolpol ]",
    ", the dot stands for the time derivative , @xmath54 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath55 is the free electron number density which can be written as @xmath56 $ ] , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the fluctuation and the background of the electron number density , respectively .",
    "the electron density fluctuations can be due to matter density perturbations or to spatial variations of the ionisation fraction .",
    "replacing @xmath59 in equation [ eq : bolpol ] by its full expression allows us to separate first order effects ( proportional to @xmath58 ) from second order effects ( proportional to @xmath57 ) .",
    "finally , the polarisation perturbations at present can be obtained by integrating the boltzmann equation ( equation ( [ eq : bolpol ] ) ) along the line of sight .    assuming that primary temperature fluctuations dominate over polarisation perturbations , the polarisation at reionisation is due to coupling between the electron density and the quadrupole moment . the solution for a single fourier mode , @xmath60 , of the boltzmann equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : bolpol ] ) is then given ( e.g. ng & ng 1996 ) by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 equals @xmath63 for the first order contribution and @xmath64 for the second order contribution , with @xmath65 being the radiation quadrupole .",
    "the visibility function @xmath66 : @xmath67 provides us with the probability that a photon had its last scattering at @xmath68 and reached the observer at the present time , @xmath69 . in equation ( [ eq : vis ] ) , @xmath70 is the optical depth and @xmath71 .",
    "as the cmb radiation possesses an rms primary quadrupole moment @xmath72 , thomson scattering between the cmb photons and free electrons generates linear polarisation .",
    "this is the case at recombination but in particular it is true at reionisation .",
    "re - scattering of the cmb photons at reionisation generates a new polarisation anisotropy at large angular scale because the horizon has grown to a much larger size by that epoch ( ng & ng 1996 ) .",
    "the location of the anisotropy ( a bump ) , @xmath73 , relates to the horizon size at the new `` last scattering '' and thus depends on the ionisation redshift @xmath74 .",
    "a fitting formula was given by liu et al ( 2001 ) : @xmath75 the height of the bump relates to the optical depth or in other words to the duration of the last scattering .",
    "such a signature ( bump at large scales ) has first been observed by wmap ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) by correlating the temperature and the polarisation power spectra .",
    "the first year wmap observations constrained the optical depth at reionisation to a high value @xmath76 and provided a simple model for the reionisation , the ionisation redshift was found to be @xmath77 .",
    "the optical depth is degenerate with the tilt of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the wmap first year result came as a surprise , in the context of earlier studies of the gunn - peterson effect inferred to be present in the most distant quasars at @xmath78 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) and of the high temperature of the intergalactic medium at @xmath79 ( theuns et al .",
    "the situation was soon rectified with the wmap 3 year data release ( spergel et al .",
    "the improved data included an @xmath0-mode polarisation map .",
    "the power spectrum is proportional to @xmath80 and the new constraints on polarisation yielded an optical depth @xmath81 .",
    "together with a better understanding of polarisation foregrounds , the improved measurements enabled the degeneracy with the tilt to be reduced .",
    "the new tilt value of @xmath82 lowers the small - scale power . despite the reduced wmap 3 year normalisation ,",
    "@xmath83 the lower optical depth implies that the constraints on the possible sources of reionisation remain essentially unchanged ( alvarez et al .",
    "precise measurements ( cosmic variance - limited ) of the @xmath0-mode polarisation power spectrum will eventually allow us to phenomenologically reconstruct the reionisation history ( e.g. hu & okamoto 2004 ) .",
    "this will help constrain the reionisation models and enable us to explore the transition between partial and total reionisation ( e.g. holder et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "reionisation must have occurred before @xmath78 and the universe is now generally considered to have become reionised at a redshift between 7 and 20 .",
    "the major question now is to identify the sources responsible for the reionisation of the universe .",
    "the ionising sources can not be a population of normal galaxies or known quasars .",
    "optical studies of the bright quasar luminosity function ( haiman , abel & madau 2001 , wyithe & loeb 2003 ) , as well the associated x - ray background ( djikstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) rule out the known quasar population as a reionisation source",
    ". however miniquasars with correspondingly softer spectra could evade this constraint .",
    "recourse must therefore be had to population iii stars or to miniquasars , both of which represent hypothetical but plausible populations of the first objects in the universe that are significant sources of ionising photons .",
    "we discuss theoretical issues in section [ reio - sourc ] . here",
    "we ask whether one can observationally distinguish between the alternative hypotheses of stellar versus miniquasar ionisation sources .",
    "the most promising techniques for probing reionisation include 21  cm emission and absorption , lyman - alpha absorption against high redshift quasars , and the statistics of lyman - alpha emitters .",
    "one distinguishing feature is the intrinsic source spectrum , which is thermal for stars but with a cut - off at a few times the lyman limit frequency , whereas it is a power - law for miniquasars with a spectrum that extends to higher energies with nearly equal logarithmic increments in energy per decade of frequency .",
    "one can also explore the evolution of the intergalactic medium during reionisation through the study of the redshifted 21  cm hyperfine triplet - singlet level transition of the ground state of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "this line allows the detection of the hi gas in the early universe .",
    "it thus represents a unique way to map the spatial distribution of intergalactic hydrogen ( e.g. madau , meiksin & reese 1997 , ciardi & madau 2003 ) .",
    "therefore it permits , in principle , a reconstruction of the reionisation history as governed by the first luminous sources .",
    "the size of the ionised structures that could be detected depends on the design of future radio telescopes .",
    "the forthcoming radio telescope , in the frequency range 80 - 180 mhz , low frequency array ( lofar ) should have the sensitivity and resolution ( @xmath84 arc minutes ) needed .",
    "using cosmological radiative transfer numerical computations with an idealised lofar array , valdes et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have simulated observations of the reionisation signal for both early and late reionisation scenarios .",
    "they show that if reionisation occurs late , lofar will be able to detect individual hi structures on arc minute scales , emitting at a brightness temperature of @xmath85  mk as a 3-@xmath86 signal in about 1000 hours of observing time .",
    "zaroubi & silk ( 2005 ) showed that we could even distinguish between stars and miniquasars as sources of reionisation since there is a dramatic difference between these two cases in the widths of the ionisation fronts .",
    "only the miniquasar model translates to scale - dependent 21  cm brightness temperature fluctuations that should be measurable by forthcoming lofar studies of the 21  cm angular correlation function ( zaroubi et al .",
    "a hitherto undetected population of lyman alpha - emitting galaxies is a possible reionisation source and may be visible during the pre - reionisation era .",
    "one can hope to detect such objects to @xmath87 relative to the damping wing of the gunn - peterson absorption from the neutral intergalactic medium outside their hii regions ( gnedin & prada 2004 ) .",
    "when reionisation is completed , the scattering between cmb photons and electrons moving along the line of sight generates secondary anisotropies through the doppler effect .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations is given by : @xmath88 with @xmath89 the velocity along the line of sight ( i.e. radial velocity ) .",
    "the electron density can be written as @xmath90 the product of the matter density @xmath91 and the ionisation fraction @xmath92 .",
    "both quantities vary around their average values .",
    "we can finally write the electron density as @xmath93 $ ] , with @xmath94 the average number of electrons and @xmath95 and @xmath96 the fluctuations of density field and ionisation fraction respectively .    by replacing the electron density expression in equation [ eq : dop ]",
    ", we can see that there is a first order effect which suffers from cancellations , and two second order effects which affect the probability of scattering of the cmb photons ( e.g. dodelson & jubas 1995 ) .",
    "they both generate secondary anisotropies .",
    "they are sometimes referred to as modulations of the doppler effect ( i.e. the velocity field ) by density and ionisation spatial variations .",
    "these are produced when the ionisation fraction is homogeneous , i.e. reionisation is completed , and when the doppler effect is modulated by spatial variations of the density field .",
    "the computation in the linear regime first appeared in sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1970 ) , was revisited by vishniac and ostriker ( ostriker & vishniac 1986 , vishniac 1987 ) , and is known as the ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect ( see also dodelson & jubas ( 1995 ) , hu & white ( 1996 ) , jaffe & kamionkowski ( 1998 ) , scannapieco ( 2000 ) , castro ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "the ov effect is a second order effect which weights as density squared ( @xmath97 ) and peaks at small angular scales ( arc minutes ) with an _ rms _ amplitude of the order of @xmath98k .",
    "the computation of the density - induced anisotropies can be generalised to mildly non - linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "because these regimes are difficult to describe analytically , a more appropriate tool is numerical simulations ( e.g. gnedin & jaffe 2001 , zhang , pen & trac 2004 ) , see also figure [ fig : rion - im ] .",
    "however , one can also use the halo model ( see review by cooray & sheth 2002 ) to model analytically the mildly non - linear regime as done for example by santos et al .",
    "( 2003 ) or ma & fry ( 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "= 8.cm = 8.3 cm    these studies showed that reionisation - induced anisotropies are dominated by the ov effect at large angular scales .",
    "the contribution from non - linear effects only intervenes at smaller scales with amplitudes of @xmath99 a few @xmath100 at @xmath101 ( figure  [ fig : reion - t ] ) .",
    "the non - linear contributions from collapsed and fully virialised structures such as galaxy clusters is historically known as the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect and will be discussed separately in section [ sec_sz ] .      before reionisation is completed , ionised and neutral regions of the universe co - exist .",
    "this is called the inhomogeneous reionisation ( ihr ) regime . in that case , the doppler effect is modulated by variations of the ionisation fraction @xmath102 .",
    "aghanim et al .",
    "( 1996 ) computed the first estimate of the power spectrum of secondary anisotropies induced by early qsos ionising the universe from @xmath103 to complete reionisation at @xmath78 .",
    "they predicted a large contribution from such fluctuations whose amplitude and distribution depended on the number density of sources , their luminosities and their lifetimes .",
    "the model was revisited by gruzinov & hu ( 1998 ) and knox , scoccimarro & dodelson ( 1998 ) who added the effect of spatial correlations between sources . the effect of an ihr on the cmb has been recently revisited in the context of a reionisation scenario compatible with wmap data . in this work ,",
    "santos et al . ( 2003 ) found that secondary fluctuations from ihr dominates over density - modulated ( ov ) anisotropies .",
    "ihr is intimately linked to the nature of the ionising sources , to their formation and evolution history and to their spatial distribution . as a result ,",
    "predictions of the ihr effect span a large range of amplitudes and angular scales .",
    "a precise forecast of the effects of ihr on the cmb anisotropies requires a precise treatment of the reionisation history of the universe together with the formation of the first ionising sources including radiative transfer ( e.g. iliev et al .",
    "2007a ) .",
    "stellar ionising sources have been studied by many authors ( e.g. cen 2003 , ciardi , ferrara & white 2003 , haiman & holder 2003 , wyithe & loeb 2003 , sokasian et al .",
    "2003 , somerville & livio 2003 ) .",
    "the first cosmological 3d simulations incorporating radiative transfer of inhomogeneous reionisation by protogalaxies were performed by gnedin ( 2000 ) .",
    "he found that reionisation by protogalaxies spans the redshift range from @xmath104 until @xmath105 .",
    "hii regions gradually expand into the low - density intergalactic medium , leaving behind neutral high - density protrusions , and within the next 10% of the hubble time , the hii regions merge as the ionising background rises by a large factor .",
    "the remaining dense neutral regions are gradually ionised .",
    "sources as luminous as protogalaxies are too rare at these redshifts and recourse must be had to a population of galactic building blocks that are plausibly associated with dwarf galaxies or miniquasars .",
    "recent studies find in general that in order to provide enough ionising flux at , or before , @xmath106 , for the usual scale - invariant primordial density perturbation power spectrum , one needs population iii stars , which provide about 20 times more ionising photons per baryon than population ii ( schaerer 2002 , bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ) , or an imf that is initially dominated by high mass stars ( daigne et al .",
    "this is in agreement with recent numerical simulations of the formation of the first stars from primordial molecular clouds suggesting that the first metal - free stars were predominantly very massive , @xmath107 ( abel , bryan & norman 2000 , 2002 , bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) .",
    "in general , possibly unrealistically high ionising photon escape fractions are required for a stellar reionisation source ( sokasian et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "miniquasars have also been considered as a significant ionising source ( e.g. ricotti & ostriker 2004 , ricotti , ostriker & gnedin 2005 , madau et al .",
    "2004 , oh 2001 , dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) . in view of the correlation between central black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , miniquasars are as plausible ionisation sources as are population iii stars , whose nucleosynthetic traces have not yet been seen even in the most metal - poor halo stars nor in the high @xmath39 lyman alpha forest . the observed correlation suggests that seed black holes must have been present before spheroid formation .",
    "recent observations of a quasar host galaxy at @xmath108 ( walter et al .",
    "2004 ) ( and other agn ) suggest that supermassive black holes were in place and predated the formation of the spheroid .",

    "for an isolated collapsed structure , there can be a change in the gravitational potential along the line of sight due to its bulk motion across the line of sight . for clusters of galaxies ,",
    "this was first shown by birkinshaw & gull ( 1983 ) ; ( see also birkinshaw ( 1989 ) for a correction to the original results ) as a way to measure their transverse velocities and is known as the `` moving - halo '' effect .",
    "at the same time , these authors pointed out to the fact that cmb anisotropies should be gravitationally lensed by such moving halos .",

    "finally , from linear perturbation theory , we have @xmath155 and @xmath156 , so we can rewrite equation ( [ eqn : panek2 ] ) as    @xmath157    the above estimate is rather crude since we have used linear perturbation theory to describe non - linear regions .",
    "moreover , it only applies to an isolated structure ( for which the rs effect is independently treated from the velocity effect ) and a proper justification can be only done using simulations where the phase dependence of the growth factor is naturally taken into account .",
    "the non - linear isw effect can also be calculated using the halo model which allows us to describe both the density and velocity fields of the large scale structure in a coherent way ( for details see cooray & sheth 2002 ) .",
    "in such an approach , the basic idea is to take the time derivative of the poisson equation ( i.e. equation ( [ eqn : kspaceposs ] ) ) and using the continuity equation in @xmath137-space given by    @xmath158    where the momentum density field @xmath159 ; one then obtains the following expression : @xmath160    this relation connects the potential time derivative to the density and the momentum density .",
    "one can now obtain the power spectrum of @xmath119 by averaging over all the @xmath137-modes .",
    "it is easy to see from equation [ eqn : kspacephidot ] that the power spectrum will involve correlation between density fields and time derivatives of density fields , as well as cross - correlation between density and momentum fields .",
    "thus the general result has information about both the classical rs effect as well as the moving - halo effect .",
    "numerical simulations capture an important point that is often missed in analytical perturbation theory calculations which is that in the strongly non - linear regime the power spectrum of @xmath119 is dominated by the momentum density .    the angular power spectrum including the non linear isw effect is shown in figure [ fig : gravsecondaries ] .",
    "for all cases , the temperature anisotropy @xmath161 is between @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum goes as the normalisation parameter @xmath164 .",

    "depending upon the background cosmology , the power spectrum peaks at @xmath134 between @xmath167 and @xmath168 and is always @xmath169 orders of magnitude less than primary cmb power spectrum .",
    "the non linear isw effect becomes equal to the primary anisotropy at @xmath170 .",
    "well before this equality is reached , it is overtaken by other sources of secondary anisotropies such as the thermal sz effect .",
    "as the cmb photons propagate from the last scattering surface , the intervening large scale structure can not only generate new secondary anisotropies ( as shown in the last section , sect .",
    "[ grav ] ) but can also gravitationally lens the primary anisotropies ( blanchard & schneider 1987,kashlinsky 1988,linder 1988 , cayon , martinez - gonzalez & sanz 1993 , seljak 1996b , metcalf & silk 1997 , hu 2000 ) . for a detailed description of the process",
    "we refer the reader to a recent and thorough review by lewis & challinor ( 2006 ) .",
    "formally , lensing does not generate any new temperature anisotropies .",
    "there are indeed no new anisotropies generated if the gravitational potential is not evolving ( see previous section for this case ) , whereas lensing occurs whenever there is a gravitational potential .",
    "since lensing conserves surface brightness , the effect of gravitational lensing of the primary cmb can only be observed if the latter has anisotropies . in this case",
    "lensing magnifies certain patches in the sky and demagnifies others ( figure [ fig : cmblens ] ) .",
    "if the primary cmb were completely isotropic , one would not be able to differentiate between the different ( de)magnifications .    for gravitational lensing , the absolute value of the light deflection does not matter . what matters is the relative deflection of close - by light rays .",
    "if all the adjacent cmb photons are isotropically deflected , there would only be a coherent shift relative to the actual pattern .",
    "however , if they are not isotropically deflected , then the net dispersion of the deflection angles would change the intrinsic anisotropies at the relevant angular scales .",
    "the net result of gravitational lensing is to transfer power from larger scales ( thus smoothing the initial peaks in the cmb power spectrum ) to smaller scales . in the following ,",
    "we detail the lensing effects on both the temperature anisotropies as well as on the polarised signal .    in order to understand the effects of gravitational lensing on the cmb power spectrum we have to write its effect on a single temperature and polarisation anisotropy .",
    "gravitational lensing modifies the cmb anisotropies , which are then measured as an angular displacement in the following way @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the original undistorted angle .",
    "however , it is inaccurate to approximate the observed temperature by a truncated expansion in the deflection angle .",
    "this is only a good approximation on scales where the cmb is very over the relevant lensing deflection , i.e. on large scales , or very small ( see challinor & lewis 2005 ) . in the weak lensing limit , the regime of interest for cmb studies , we can use the perturbative approach and write the lensed cmb anisotropies as : @xmath173 with @xmath174 given by : @xmath175 @xmath176 is the angular diameter distance between redshifts @xmath39 and @xmath177 and @xmath178 is the perpendicular gradient of the newtonian potential in the direction @xmath179 . in the same way , the modified polarisation anisotropy is written as @xmath180 which similarly gives second order : @xmath181      in order to have an idea of the effect of gravitational lensing on the cmb power spectrum , we can consider its counterpart the two point correlation function .",
    "in the small angle approximation , we can use the perturbative approach to second order and obtain : @xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184    = 11.cm    the lensed power spectrum @xmath185 as a function of the unaltered power spectrum @xmath186 is obtained after fourier transformation , which is directly associated with multipole decomposition .",

    "these include advances in understanding the formation and evolution of cluster size halos ( in practice , a tighter fitting for the mass function ) , a well understood / controlled cluster selection function as well as a robust observational proxy for the cluster mass .",
    "additionally , one would need a follow - up program to estimate the redshifts of these clusters .",
    "finally , one needs to calibrate and control any instrumental systematics . for a sz survey detecting 10,000 - 20,000 poisson distributed clusters in roughly 10 redshift bins with equal weights ,",
    "the statistical uncertainty is @xmath313 .",
    "this gives a ballpark number at which systematic uncertainties need to be controlled .",
    "the first requirement depends on our ability to perform large simulations .",
    "this becomes more feasible with the increase in computational power .",
    "the second requirement translates into understanding cluster selection function ( the limiting mass and the completeness level of the survey ) from , as realistic as possible , mock cluster catalogs . for telescope beam larger than the cluster , a survey is limited by sz flux .",
    "moreover , since for sz fluxes , the redshift dependence enters through the angular diameter distance rather than the luminosity distance , the mass selection function is more uniform than that of x - ray surveys , except at nearby redshifts ( @xmath314 ) where the clusters will be partially resolved .",
    "the mass - selection function is directly linked with the cluster sz - flux measurements through cluster scaling relations ( kaiser 1982 , borgani 2006 ) .",
    "finally , it has been pointed out ( da silva et al .",
    "2001 , motl et al .",
    "2005 , pfrommer et al .",
    "2006 ) that the sz - flux of a galaxy cluster is a good proxy for its virial mass with a tight scatter in the scaling relation .",
    "the relation between the virial mass @xmath281 and the sz - flux @xmath315 can be written as f_sz(z , ) d_a^2= f ( ) f_gas a_sz m_vir^_sz e(z)^2/3 f ( , z ) , where @xmath316 , @xmath317 is the sz frequency dependence , @xmath318 is the gas fraction of the cluster out to the virial radius , @xmath319 and @xmath320 are the amplitude and slope of the scaling relation and @xmath321 denotes any deviation from the standard evolution . for simplicity , we usually set @xmath322 . the complexity of cluster structure",

    "uncertainties in the mass  observable relation can in principle be reduced by the use of `` self - calibration '' techniques ( majumdar & mohr 2004 ) where one uses additional observables such as the power spectrum of galaxy clusters ( majumdar & mohr 2004,lima & hu 2004 ) . moreover ,",
    "the distribution of clusters in observed flux at each redshift provides additional mass information ( hu 2003 ) .",
    "finally , direct mass measurements through x - ray observations , optical spectroscopy or weak lensing provide important additional leverage on cluster masses and hence on cosmology ( majumdar & mohr 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "once parameter degeneracies are broken through use of multiple cluster information , it is possible to achieve strong cosmological constraints from upcoming cluster surveys . as as example , in figure [ fig : spt_cosmo ] , we show forecasts for @xmath324 and @xmath310 constraint from south pole telescope ( spt ) survey .",
    "it also shows that sz clusters as probes are highly complementary to other experiments since each experiment constrains a different combination of cosmological parameters and is subject to different systematics .",
    "however , due to the very nature of the entanglement between gas physics and cosmology in using clusters as cosmological probes , there must be cosmology - cluster physics degeneracies ( majumdar & mohr 2003 , majumdar & cox 2007 ) .",
    "these degeneracies can be broken by adding constraints from complementary information within cluster surveys ( such as @xmath325 ) or external information ( e.g. mass follow - up ) .",
    "the sz effect from galaxy clusters is one of the major sources of secondary temperature anisotropies . a convenient way of describing its effect on the cmb is by computing its angular power spectrum .",
    "the fluctuations in the temperature background due to sz effect from clusters of galaxies can be expressed in terms of correlations between the fluctuations along two lines of sight separated by an angle .",
    "the rms distortion can be quantified by the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath326 , which is defined as @xmath327 .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the sz effect is then given by @xmath328 , the brackets denoting an ensemble average .",
    "the sz power spectrum can be derived from numerical simulation of structure formation and evolution or from analytical computations . in the first approach ,",
    "hydrodynamical numerical simulations are the most appropriate way to describe both the dark matter of which the gravitational potential wells are made of , and the baryonic gas which is responsible of the sz effect .",
    "various groups ( scaramella , cen & ostriker 1993 , da silva et al . 2000 , refregier et al .",
    "2000 , refregier & teyssier 2002 , seljak , burwell & pen 2001 , zhang , pen & wang 2002 ) have performed such kind of simulations and computed the associated power spectra . a compilation of the predictions from the different groups can be found in springel , white & herquist ( 2001 ) .",
    "the sz power spectra computed from numerical simulations globally agree within a factor of two .",
    "however , the results are quite sensitive to the resolution of the simulations which acts as an artificial damping effect at small angular scales , and to the size of simulation which if not large enough underestimates the number of massive clusters and thus the power at large angular scales .    in the second approach",
    ", the sz power spectrum can be computed analytically ( cole & kaiser 1988 , makino & suto 1993 , atrio - barandela & mucket 1999 , molnar & birkinshaw 2000 , komatsu & kitayama 1999 , cooray 2000 , 2001 , majumdar 2001 , komatsu & seljak 2002 ) the computation is based on two quantities :    * the cluster number counts or mass function @xmath279 which provides us with the number of clusters of a given mass @xmath281 present at a redshift @xmath39 ( see section [ sec : szcounts ] ) . *",
    "the cluster model or mass  sz flux relation , i.e. its temperature and density profiles which give the spatial form factor of the associated sz effect .    to begin with ,",
    "let us assume that the cluster cross - correlation function can be known ( for details see peebles 1980 , cole & kaiser 1988 ) .",
    "the pattern of temperature anisotropy on the sky , induced by a population of clusters , is found by the convolution of the temperature anisotropy due a single `` template '' cluster of mass @xmath281 at redshift @xmath39 with the angular distribution of the clusters , and then integrating over their mass and redshift distributions .",
    "if one takes an ensemble average and further assumes that @xmath329 is constant over the range of comoving separations for which the cross - correlation function @xmath330 is non zero , then the angular temperature power spectrum @xmath186 can be written as the sum of two terms , the  1-halo \" or the poisson term and  2-halo \" or the clustering term , i.e    c_^total = c_^poisson + c_^clustering  . the power spectrum for the poisson distribution of objects",
    "can then be written as ( cole & kaiser 1988 )    c_^poisson = _ 0^z_max dz dv(z ) _ m_min^m_max dm dn(m , z ) |y_(m , z)|^2 , where @xmath331 is the differential comoving volume and @xmath279 is the number density of objects and @xmath332 is the 2d fourier transform of the projected compton @xmath41-parameter .",
    "the mass range is chosen so as to cover from group scale to the largest cluster scales .",
    "since these fluctuations occur at small angular scales , we can use the small angle approximation of the legendre transformation and write @xmath332 as the angular fourier transform of @xmath333 as @xmath334)\\theta]\\theta d\\theta $ ] ( peebles 1980 , molnar & birkinshaw 2000 ) , where @xmath335 is the bessel function of the first kind and zero order .",
    "the clustering power spectra depends on lines of sight passing though an ensemble of correlated clusters .",
    "it can be estimated ( komatsu & kitayama 1999 ) as    c_^clustering = _ 0^z_max dz dv(z ) p(k ) ^2 , where @xmath336 is the time dependent linear bias factor .",
    "the matter power spectrum , @xmath337 , is related to the power spectrum of cluster correlation function @xmath338 through the bias , , @xmath339 .",
    "convenient expressions for the bias at cluster scales are given by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) and jing ( 1999 ) .",
    "when one calculates the variance in beams of fixed size , the poissonian model is a good approximation if the probability that a cluster has a neighbour is small inside the beam . this probability is the product of the number density and the volume integral of the cross - correlation function over the region probed by the beam .",
    "it can be shown that for beams comparable to the size of rich clusters ( @xmath340 mpc ) , the poissonian approach is a valid approximation . only for very large beams",
    ", the variance will increase due to positive correlation of the clusters .",
    "it can be shown that the poisson power spectrum dominates at all @xmath134 values greater than 100 .",
    "however , by subtracting , x - ray selected clusters of galaxies over a certain flux ( @xmath341 erg @xmath342 s@xmath236 ) , from both power spectra , one can make the clustering part of the spectrum dominates around @xmath343 ( komatsu & kitayama 1999 , majumdar 2001b ) .    to calculate the 2d profile of each cluster in the cluster ensemble",
    ", one needs a cluster gas density and temperature model .",
    "this can be either the empirical truncated @xmath271-profile ( e.g. in molnar & birkinshaw 2000 ) , or it can be derived by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of a gas within a nfw dark matter potential ( e.g. in komatsu & seljak 2001 ) , or it can simply be obtained from fits to simulated cluster profiles as in diego & majumdar ( 2004 ) .",
    "= 8.cm = 9.cm = 8.cm = 9.cm",
    "both the volume element and the abundance of clusters depend on the cosmological model . as a consequence the power spectrum will also vary with varying cosmological parameters",
    "( komatsu & seljak 2002 , see also figure [ fig : szpowspec ] left panel ) .",
    "for example , sz power spectrum is sensitive to the density parameter @xmath140 which mainly affects the number of low and moderate redshift clusters , and the equation of state of the dark energy @xmath344 which mainly affects the number of high redshift clusters .",
    "however in the range of allowed values for @xmath140 and @xmath310 the effects are rather small . as for the other parameters the effects are quite negligible , except that of @xmath165 .",
    "the sz power spectrum is strongly sensitive to the normalisation of mass fluctuations at cluster scales , i.e @xmath165 .",

    "the cluster power spectrum depends , just like the mass function , on the cluster physics more specifically the mass  observable relation affects the power spectrum ( figure [ fig : szpowspec ] , right panel ) .",
    "recently , the estimated power spectrum from the cbi - acbar - bima data interpreted as an sz signal has been used to constrain the value of @xmath165 .",
    "the resulting value @xmath349 was found higher than other estimates of @xmath165 which are now converging to the range [ 0.70.8 ] . by forcing the clusters in the simulations or in the analytic calculations of sz-@xmath186 to have scaling properties compatible with observed clusters",
    ", one can fit the cbi excess with a @xmath165 closer to wmap 3 years value .",
    "note , however , that the excess @xmath165 only appears if we believe that the resulting excess cmb fluctuations at the cbi scales is due to sz effect from galaxy clusters .",
    "it has indeed been pointed out ( toffolatti et al .",
    "2005 , douspis , aghanim & langer 2006 ) that sz from clusters are only mildly needed if there are unremoved point sources below the detection limit . on a a more speculative note ,",
    "non - gaussianity in the primordial power spectrum can boost the sz power spectrum at cluster scales up to cbi excess ( mathis , diego & silk 2004 , sadeh , rephaeli & silk 2006 ) .",

    "it was shown in douspis , aghanim & langer ( 2006 ) that the sz contribution , if coherently taken into account , affects the determination of cosmological parameters such as the normalisation @xmath165 , the optical depth @xmath350 and the initial power spectrum index @xmath217 . however , the tsz contribution should in principle be removed down to a given cluster mass from the measured power spectrum provided multi - frequency observations are conducted . to this aim",
    "many methods have been proposed and developed especially in the context of planck experiment ( sanz , herranz & martinez - gonzalez 2001 , vielva et al .",

    "all of them take benefit from the specific spectral signature of tsz signal discussed in sect.[sec_sz ] .",
    "these methods also use additional spatial constraint based on adapted or matched filters , wavelets , etc .",
    "they are mainly aimed at providing us with sz cluster catalogues that will be further used as cosmological probes .",
    "consequently they help in cleaning out the primary cmb signal . in practice",
    "the sensitivity limits of the experiments , their frequency coverages as well as their finite beams prevent us from a complete cleaning of the tsz effect .",
    "the tsz effect is not the only source of power at small scales .",
    "one can also probe ksz by its effect on the power spectrum at high @xmath134 . from amplitude arguments , it is easy to find that the amplitude of the ksz power spectrum is much smaller that that of the tsz . however , patchy reionisation has interesting implications for the ksz effect power spectrum ( iliev et al .",
    "2007b ) . at fixed optical depth , patchy reionisation approximately doubles the total ksz power above @xmath351 by up to an order of magnitude compared to a uniform reionisation scenario . the ksz effect has",
    "the same dependence as the cmb anisotropies and the multi - frequency observations do not serve in removing this contribution .",
    "optimised methods to extract a map of the ksz temperature fluctuations from the cmb anisotropies can be developed ( forni & aghanim 2004 ) .",
    "assuming that a map of compton parameters for the tsz effect can be obtained by multi - frequency separation , one can take benefit from the spatial correlation between ksz and tsz effects which are due to the same galaxy clusters .",
    "this correlation allows us to use the tsz map as a spatial template in order to mask , in the temperature anisotropy map encompassing both cmb and ksz signal , the regions where clusters must have imprinted an sz fluctuation . by further using the statistical properties of ksz , which is a non - gaussian , one can perform achieve good separation of the ksz signal out of the primary cmb .",
    "the sz effect , as proposed originally by sunyaev & zeldovich , represents the shift experienced by the cmb photons when they undergo inverse compton interactions with the free electrons of the hot ionised intra - cluster gas .",
    "the sz effect is thus historically associated with the galaxy clusters .",
    "however and more generally , inverse compton scattering can take place in all astrophysical environments where both conditions of ionisation and high temperature are fulfilled . as a result , the sz effect was studied in a variety of redshift domains and astrophysical sources from early proto - galaxies and galaxies , to local galaxies like m31 , as suggested by taylor , moodley & diego ( 2003 ) .    in the standard scenario of structure formation",
    ", baryonic matter is believed to lay in the potential wells formed by the dm .",
    "the baryonic matter in dynamical equilibrium with the dm can thus reach high temperatures at virialisation .",
    "the baryonic gas can be heated by additional means ( photoionisation , mechanical heating , ... ) .",
    "therefore , induced sz anisotropies are expected to span a large range amplitudes and angular scales .    at intermediate and large angular scales ,",
    "a warm - hot gas ( @xmath352 kev ) is likely to exist in the large structures of the cosmic web .",
    "this gas might account for a fraction of the missing baryons ( e.g. fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "due to its relatively large temperature , this warm medium is expected to exhibit an sz signal but also an x - ray emission .",
    "observing the sz signal from this warm medium , which would contribute to the cmb signal at large scales , is certainly important from the cmb point of view for disentangling between primary and secondary anisotropies .",
    "observing the warm medium may be also a unique way to seek for , and find , the missing baryons in the universe .",
    "several studies have aimed at studying and describing this contribution . since it is associated with non - linear structures",
    "the ideal tool is numerical simulations ( e.g. springel , white & hernquist 2001 , da silva et al .",
    "2001 , zhang , pen & wang 2002 ) .",
    "the expected sz signal was found to have quite low amplitudes , thus , making it difficult to detect directly .",
    "one way around the problem might to target the correlations between sz signal and x - ray emission .",
    "future experiments will tell us to what extent this will be possible .    at smaller angular scale scales , when structures collapse to form galaxies the temperature of the baryonic gas increases to larger values due to shock heating .",
    "moreover , the thermal content of the collapsed structures increases due to feed - back processes ( star formation , agn activity , ... ) . in both cases ,",
    "an sz signal is expected at the galaxy scale .",
    "its detailed amplitude depends on the efficiency of the heating mechanisms and of the galactic environment ( mainly the gas density ) .",
    "the predicted sz signal has been computed in both cases for shock heating and feed - back . in the first case , valageas , balbi & silk ( 2001 ) found that the contribution from collapsed objects dominates only at very small scales @xmath353 .",
    "the sz signal from galaxies can be even larger if they host central supermassive black - holes ( bh ) . in that case",
    "the galactic outflows powered by the mechanical energy of accreting matter onto the bh induce an important sz signal as large as the cobe limit ( e.g. natarajan & sigurdsson 1999 , aghanim , balland & silk 2000 , lapi , cavaliere & de zotti 2003 ) .",
    "sz effect from quasar feedback ( chatterjee & kosowsky 2007 ) has been predicted at @xmath354k level which is potentially detectable by alma .",
    "the feed - back from stars and its associated sz effect was also studied .",
    "rosa - gonzalez et al.(2004 ) calculated the signal expected from star - formation activity during the formation of the most luminous bulges of normal galaxies .",
    "they found that the temperatures and densities were high enough to produce @xmath41 parameters comparable to those of galaxy clusters .",
    "the supernova driven galactic winds during the early stages of evolution of normal galaxies can also cause the distortion of the cmb radiation as proposed by ( majumdar & nath 2001 ) .",
    "finally , sz effect can not only arise from forming or early formed objects but it can also be associated with relic objects such as hot regions , `` cocoons '' , around radio galaxies as proposed by yamada , sugiyama & silk ( 1999 ) . in that case , the compton parameter associated with the ensemble of cocoons was found to be of the same order as the cobe constraint .",
    "radio galaxies in galaxy clusters can eject large quantities of energy which is either thermalised or remains as relativistic radio plasma ( radio ghost ) in the galaxy clusters .",
    "ensslin & kaiser ( 2000 ) estimated the compton parameter from these two phases and found it too small to be detected . however a statistical estimate of the relativistic population in clusters can be envisaged by stacking the sz signal from all the cluster detected by future planck satellite ( ensslin & hansen 2004 ) .",
    "in some cases the ionised regions have too low temperatures or densities , or both , to exhibit significant compton distortions . in these cases , the kinetic sz effect ( if the gas moves with respect to the cmb ) becomes the dominant source of secondary anisotropies .",
    "this is , particularly , the case for the patchy reionisation ( aghanim et al.1996 ) . here",
    ", the temperature of the ionised bubbles generated by emitting and ionising sources is low ( typically @xmath355k ) implying a negligible @xmath41 distortion , but the proper motion of the ionised bubbles causes significant ksz fluctuations .",
    "the secondary anisotropies due to doppler effect have been the subject of quite a large number of studies , in the context of the reionisation problem , especially in view of the first year wmap constraints on optical depth ( see sect . [",
    "sec : reion ] and references therein for details ) . a large tsz signal from the sources responsible for the reionisation",
    "is however not excluded yet .",
    "it might on the contrary contribute to the excess power measured by cbi and bima .",
    "an example for this is the case in which early massive stars have played an important role in the reionisation history of the universe ( oh , cooray & kamionkowski 2003 ) .",
    "as shown by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1980 ) not only cmb intensity is altered by the presence of clusters , through the tsz and ksz effects , the cmb polarisation is affected by the presence of galaxy clusters along the photon lines of sight .",
    "polarisation anisotropies are generated when the photons scatter off free electrons in the intracluster medium .",
    "the cluster - induced polarisation can be of a different origin : due to the cmb quadrupole itself , to the cluster transverse motion or rotation ( chluba & mannheim 2002 ) , to its finite optical depth or to the presence of cluster magnetic fields . in the following",

    "a second scattering within the cluster induces polarisation of the order of @xmath361 and @xmath362 without modifying the frequency dependences .",

    "also widely used are the higher order moments of the wavelet coefficients ( skewness and excess kurtosis ) ( e.g. pando , valls - gabaud & fanf 1998 , forni & aghanim 1999 , hobson , jones & lasenby 1999 , barreiro & hobson 2001 ) .",
    "the wavelet analysis , in the dyadic wavelet transform scheme , decomposes a signal @xmath49 in a series of the form : @xmath387 where @xmath388 is the number of decomposition levels , @xmath389 the wavelet ( or detail ) coefficients at position @xmath137 and scale @xmath390 ( the indexing is such that @xmath391 corresponds to the finest scale , i.e. highest frequencies ) , and @xmath392 is a coarse or smooth version of the original signal @xmath49 .",
    "other tests of non - gaussianity are the global minkowski functionals like the total area of excursion regions enclosed by isotemperature contours or total contour length and genus ( e.g. gott et al.1990 , schmalzing & gorski 1998 , novikov , schmalzing & mukhanov 2000 , shandarin 2002 ) , the harmonic space analysis ( hansen , pastor & semikoz 2002 ) , the peak statistics ( e.g. bond & efstathiou 1987 , vittorio & juszkiewicz 1987 ) .    not only departures from the simplest inflation model can generate non - gaussian signatures .",
    "systematic effects , point source and foreground - induced non - gaussianities will inevitably arise at small scales from the secondary anisotropies , either through the non - linear growth of fluctuations or through the interactions of cmb photons with the potential wells or ionised matter along their lines of sight .",
    "besides , the study of secondary non - gaussianities is very interesting on its own , since it is related to the cosmic structures , their evolution and spatial distribution ; it is also of great importance in order to go beyond the information provided by the power spectrum of the cmb primary anisotropies . in this context",
    ", the higher order statistics of the secondary anisotropies are used to predict the ng signatures of non - primordial origin in the cmb , and to better detect and understand the structures themselves .",
    "the ng signatures are of particular importance in the case of gravitational lensing since they allow us in theory to reconstruct the mass distribution of the lenses . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the deflection angles are small compared to the scale of structures and the lensing effect is hardly seen directly in a cmb map .",
    "the effects on the power spectrum are generally small and sub - dominant , and the two point - statistics is thus not sufficient to allow for the reconstruction of the mass distribution of lenses .",
    "to better identify the effects of gravitational lensing on the cmb , one has therefore to consider the induced ng signatures , naturally arising from the second order effects in the anisotropies ( correlations between large scale gradients and small scale generated power ) , through higher - order statistics .",
    "the week lensing of primary anisotropies produces a four - point signature ( e.g. bernardeau 1997 , zaldarriaga 2000 , kesden , cooray & kamionkowski 2003 ) .",
    "quadratic statistics ( such as the power spectrum of the squared temperature maps ) permit us to recover the information in the four - point function about the mass distribution of the lens field ( e.g. zaldarriaga & seljak 1999 , hu 2001 , takada 2001 , hu & okamoto 2002 , cooray & kesden 2003 ) .",
    "these methods use lensed anisotropy maps only , or combine them with the polarisation field ( especially the @xmath1 field ) which is less contaminated by the primary signal . in all cases , mapping the lens , and thus dark matter , distribution requires high resolution , high signal - to - noise maps of the cmb temperature fluctuations and polarisation fields",
    ".    the interactions of cmb photons with the free electrons along their lines of sight , through compton or doppler effects , also produce secondary ng signatures .",
    "these sources of secondary anisotropies are expected to be important ; it was therefore necessary to forecast their ng signal and study its detectability .",
    "this was done mainly for the sz effect and the inhomogeneous reionisation through the trispectrum ( cooray 2001 ) and through the high - order moments of the wavelet coefficients ( aghanim & forni 1999 ) . for the sz thermal effect , cooray ( 2001 ) gave the expression for the trispectrum of the tsz effect in the flat sky approximation @xmath393 where @xmath394 designate the connected part and @xmath395 is given by @xmath396 where @xmath397 is the pressure trispectrum .",
    "the weight function @xmath398 is given in the rayleigh - jeans regime .",
    "in all cases , the signal from sz effect dominates at small angular scales .",
    "for all vector - like fields such as the ostriker - vishniac effect , but also the mildly non - linear regime probed by the ksz effect for large scale structures , even moments were shown to dominate over odd moments , making the trispectrum a more sensitive estimator of non - gaussianity than the bispectrum ( castro 2004 ) . as a result while the bispectrum is most likely undetectable by future cmb experiments , the trispectrum of the ov effect could be measured by planck or by arc - minute scale interferometric experiments .",
    "the ng signatures associated with the secondary effects can be used to probe and trace the matter distribution , they can also be use as additional constraints to separate the secondary effects from the primary cmb signal ( e.g. forni & aghanim 2004 ) . however in all these cases ,",
    "this signal at small angular scales is the sum of the cmb anisotropies and all the secondary contributions .",
    "this makes it harder to disentangle them and requires the use of the polarisation field or cross - correlations and couplings between components .",
    "figure [ fig : nong ] shows an example of sz angular power spectra for the galaxy cluster contribution , demonstrating that the non - gaussian @xmath379 model can have a substantial impact for @xmath399 especially in the case of wmap-3 yrs normalisation @xmath400 ) . also shown",
    "are examples of gaussian models with different normalisations @xmath401 and an early dark energy model ( bartelmann , doran & wetterich 2006 ) .",
    "secondary effects induce temperature and polarisation anisotropies .",
    "these additional anisotropies contribute to the cmb signal and modify ( at certain scales ) both its amplitude and its statistical character .",
    "such contribution was not actually important within the context of first generation of cmb experiments ( e.g. cobe ) .",
    "already now with wmap , and even more so with future planck satellite , the aim of measuring the cmb signal with fundamental instrumental noise limits forces us to investigate with extreme care the effects of the secondary anisotropies .",
    "they might constitute in some cases important limiting factor on the scientific objectives of future cmb studies such that constraining the energy scale of inflation through the @xmath1-mode polarisation induced by the stochastic gravitational wave background , or constraining the inflationary field through the statistical nature of the temperature anisotropies .",
    "present day cmb experiments are now reaching sensitivities and angular resolutions such that secondary effects can be no longer neglected .",
    "this is the case for lensing by large scale structures which convert the @xmath0-mode primary polarisation into a @xmath1-mode secondary contribution and is by far the largest contaminant .",
    "this is also the case for the example of the sz effect from galaxy clusters which could explain the excess of power at high multipoles measured by acbar , bima and cbi .",
    "the sz effect is more than a nuisance factor to cosmological parameter extraction .",
    "it is a potentially powerful tool for cosmology .",
    "sz cluster counts can be used to probe the cosmological model and put constraints on the nature of dark energy . in combination with other observations , especially at x - ray energies , it allows us to measure cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant and the cluster gas mass fraction ( e.g. grego et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the sz effect can also be used to characterise the clusters themselves as it potentially can measure their radial peculiar velocities ( lamarre et al .",
    "1998 , benson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the non - relativistic corrections to the sz effect can also be used to measure the gas temperature directly for massive clusters . this might an important issue for future sz surveys for which x - ray counterparts will not be available .",
    "the spectral signature of the sz effect can in principle probe the electron gas distribution and constrain any non - thermal electron population in the intracluster medium .",
    "moreover multi - frequency sz measurements might provide a novel way of constraining the cmb temperature and its evolution with redshift ( battistelli et al .",
    "2003 , horellou et al .",
    "2005 ) .    to achieve these goals , high precision measurements of the sz effect will be needed over large areas of the sky .",
    "this requires a new generation of sz telescopes that are already being built or designed .",
    "following ovro and bima , the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) which consists of eight 3.5 metre telescopes is operating at 2636 ghz and 85115 ghz .",
    "the sza along with bima / ovro forms the combined array for millimeter astronomy ( carma ) telescope which aims at providing high resolution , detailed imaging of sz clusters .",
    "several other telescopes are being commissioned ( e.g. ami ) , in 2007 , with the aim of surveying large areas of the sz sky for blind detection of clusters .",
    "these deep sz cluster surveys will be performed by the amiba interferometer , the south pole telescope ( spt ) , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) . moreover",
    ", the planck satellite scheduled to be launched in 2008 will detect thousands of sz clusters over the whole sky .",
    "although both act and spt are primarily designed for sz cluster detection , the predicted ksz signal , at a few arc minute scales , induced by the reionisation might be sufficiently strong to be detected by these upcoming experiments ( figure [ fig : act - spt ] ) .",
    "these high @xmath134 measurements of the reionisation - induced temperature anisotropies will however not suffice to unravel the ionisation history .",
    "polarisation measurements at low @xmath134 are the optimal cmb tool to achieve this . in the near future",
    ", planck will provide all sky @xmath0-mode polarisation maps and will be sensitive to partial or double reionisation models at the percent level . in principle",
    "this could help discriminate between different models with identical optical depths ( kaplinghat et al .",
    "2003 ) , subject to our being able to understand , model and remove the relevant galactic foregrounds . in combination with low frequency radio interferometer such as lofar and eventually ska it should be possible to probe the onset of the reionisation and the end of the dark ages by anti - correlating 21  cm emission and cmb temperature fluctuations ( alvarez et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the next generation of polarisation - optimised satellites , such as b - pol or epic , is being designed to measure the primary @xmath1-modes from inflation .",
    "these experiments will inevitably have high enough sensitivity to actually reconstruct the ionisation history of the universe .",
    "a new generation of moderate resolution ground - based and balloon - born cmb polarisation ( clover , at 97 , 150 , and 220  ghz , quiet at 40 and 90  ghz , quad , ebex , bicep , spider , brain ) are under operation , construction or design .",
    "the principal aim is to measure primordial @xmath1-modes .",
    "they will also measure weak lensing - induced @xmath1-modes with resolution over multipoles @xmath402 and down to @xmath990.1@xmath98k precision .",
    "this is an essential prerequisite to searching , at these scales , for the gravity - wave induced @xmath1-mode background from inflation . for @xmath403 ,",
    "current constraints on the scalar to tensor ration should allow the primordial signal to dominate lensing .",
    "secondary effects are not simply a `` foreground '' that adds noise and limits our knowledge .",
    "they are by nature the best tools to probe structure formation and evolution providing a complementary picture of the late time universe to that obtained from traditional tools like galaxy surveys .",
