    "for 85 years , it has been known that our universe is expanding ( lematre 1927 ) .",
    "this expansion was believed to slow down in time because of gravitational attraction .",
    "however , based on observations of luminous standard candles ( type ia supernoave ) riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested instead accelerated expansion , turning cosmology upside down and winning the most recent nobel prize in physics .",
    "more than a decade after this discovery , accelerated expansion is well established .",
    "a de - acceleration during the initial few billion years after the `` big bang '' , when densities of matter and radiation were much higher than today , is followed by accelerated expansion .",
    "the cause of the accelerated expansion is so far unknown and is described by the term `` dark energy '' . following the standard model ,",
    "it should account for the majority of the energy density of the universe and retards the formation of large scale structure .",
    "understanding dark energy may be the most important problem existing in physics today .",
    "dark energy dominates the energy budget , accelerates the expansion of the universe , and affects large scale structure .",
    "what is its nature ?",
    "there are three classes of potential explanations : ( 1 ) a cosmological constant , which has been proposed already in the early days of general relativity ( einstein 1917 ) as a kind of repulsive gravity , ( 2 ) a scalar field , somewhat analogous to that proposed to explain inflation at a much earlier time ( e.g. , wetterich 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ) , and ( 3 ) modified gravity ( e.g. , tsujikawa 2010 ) , which will not be considered here .    assuming that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ( as approximately suggested by the large scale matter distribution and the 3k microwave background ) , the space - time metric can be written in the following form @xmath4,\\ ] ] with @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 ( 1 + @xmath1)@xmath8 being time and cosmic scale factor , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denoting comoving spatial coordinates , and @xmath12 representing the curvature of 3-dimensional space . the field equations of general relativity , applied to this friedmann - robertson - walker metric , lead to the so - called friedmann equations , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 is the hubble parameter for a given time ( @xmath0 stands for redshift @xmath1 = 0 ) , @xmath16 is the density of matter and radiation , @xmath17 denotes pressure , and @xmath18 represents the traditional cosmological constant , which ( like dark energy ) can be subsumed into the density and pressure term , @xmath19 defining @xmath20 = @xmath17/@xmath16 , the different ( in part putative ) components yield : +    matter : @xmath20 = 0 + radiation : @xmath20 = 1/3 + `` quintessential '' scalar field : 1 @xmath21 @xmath20 @xmath21 1/3 + cosmological constant : @xmath20 = 1 + phantom energy : @xmath20 @xmath21 1 +    the resulting values of @xmath20 determine the normalized acceleration @xmath22/@xmath6 . for gravity ( matter )",
    "we obtain the expected negative value .",
    "this also holds for radiation , which has dominated , according to the standard model , at redshifts @xmath2310@xmath24 .",
    "the ( @xmath16 + 3@xmath17 ) term in eq.1.4 directly infers that @xmath20 values smaller than 1/3 are required for accelerated expansion , which is therefore the possible @xmath20 range for dark energy . @xmath20 and @xmath15 , and thus also @xmath0 ,",
    "are obviously related , emphasizing the cosmological importance of the hubble constant .    .",
    "@xmath25 is the energy density of baryonic and dark matter in units of the critical density , @xmath26 is the corresponding parameter for dark energy .",
    "for a `` flat '' universe , @xmath25 + @xmath27 = 1 .",
    "the data are consistent with a wide range of @xmath0 values.,width=479 ]    fig .",
    "1 shows the range of not necessarily flat cosmological cold dark matter ( cdm ) models consistent with wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) . assuming that the universe is flat",
    "would provide a rather accurate solution , but is it really flat as suggested by inflationary models ?",
    "the present value of the curvature radius , @xmath28 , is related to @xmath0 and @xmath29 = @xmath25 + @xmath26 ( see fig .  1 for definitions ) by @xmath30 c",
    "is the speed of light and ( c/2 ) @xmath31",
    "@xmath32 @xmath2 2.1gpc is known as the hubble radius .",
    "obviously , with our present precision to determine @xmath29 , curvature radii as small 10gpc can not be excluded and we are still far from being able to state that the universe is truly flat .",
    "all this implies that the cosmic microwave background alone does not provide stringent limits .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the cmb provides information at a single early epoch , when dark energy did not play a role .",
    "its importance can only be deduced by a combination of cmb observations with data from the much younger universe .",
    "there are several lines of observational activity to constrain the wide range of models permitted by the cmb : these include ( 1 ) type ia supernovae , the standard candles , where luminosity distances and redshifts can be compared ; ( 2 ) galaxy clusters , where redshift independent ratios between baryonic and dark matter masses can only be obtained with a small subset of possible cosmologies ; ( 3 ) gravitational lensing or cosmic shear , where the dark matter distribution can be determined , isolating dark energy ; and ( 4 ) baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , which left an imprint on the cosmic microwave background , which is clearly seen in cmb power spectra ( e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 , 2007",
    "; komatsu et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this imprint is still visible affecting structure at moderate redshifts and providing a local size scale of order 140mpc .",
    "all these tracers are observed at significant redshifts .",
    "however , it is at redshift zero where dark energy is most dominant , and only here its energy density is significantly higher than that of baryonic and dark matter combined .",
    "thus it is the hubble constant , providing a measure of the _ local _ universe , which provides the longest lever arm with respect to the cmb to measure the effects of dark energy ( hu 2005 ) .     and",

    "7 indicates , angular resolution is another essential point .",

    "aside of the maser sources mentioned above , new targets have been detected , which look promising when analyzing their single dish spectra .",
    "while it remains to be seen how useful they will be for detailed mapping , it is worth mentioning that so far no systemic feature has been detected that shows a secular drift to the blue side .",
    "either the nuclei are opaque at 22ghz or the radiation is so highly beamed that maser photons from the backside of the disks have no chance to reach us ."
