    "a higgs - like boson around @xmath8gev was discovered at the lhc .",
    "although its properties are being measured yet , it complies with the expected behaviour and therefore it is a very compelling candidate to be the standard model ( sm ) higgs .",
    "an obvious question to address is to which extent alternative scenarios of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) can be already discarded or strongly constrained . in particular , what are the implications for strongly - coupled models where the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically ?",
    "the existing phenomenological tests have confirmed the @xmath3 pattern of symmetry breaking , giving rise to three goldstone bosons @xmath9 which , in the unitary gauge , become the longitudinal polarizations of the gauge bosons .",
    "when the @xmath10 coupling @xmath11 is neglected , the electroweak goldstone dynamics is described at low energies by the same lagrangian as the qcd pions , replacing the pion decay constant by the ewsb scale @xmath12gev  @xcite . in most strongly - coupled scenarios the symmetry",
    "is nonlinearly realized and one expects the appearance of massive resonances generated by the non - perturbative interaction .",
    "the dynamics of goldstones and massive resonance states can be analyzed in a generic way by using an effective lagrangian , based on symmetry considerations .",
    "the theoretical framework is completely analogous to the resonance chiral theory description of qcd at gev energies  @xcite .    using these techniques ,",
    "we have investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and as an update of ref .",
    "@xcite , the oblique @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters  @xcite , characterizing the new physics contributions in the electroweak boson self - energies , within strongly - coupled models that incorporate a light higgs - like boson . adopting a dispersive approach and imposing a proper high - energy behaviour , it has been shown there that it is possible to calculate @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the next - to - leading order , _",
    "i.e. _ at one - loop . note that these results do not depend on unnecessary ultraviolet cut - offs .",
    "we concluded that there is room for these models , but they are stringently constrained .",
    "the vector and axial - vector states should be heavy enough ( with masses above the tev scale ) , the mass splitting between them is highly preferred to be small and the higgs - like scalar should have a @xmath13 coupling close to the standard model one .",
    "previous one - loop analyses can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a continuation  @xcite , and as a first approach to the determination of the low energy constants of the electroweak",
    "effective theory at low energies ( without resonances ) , we do this estimation in the case of the purely higgsless bosonic lagrangian ( withouth resonances ) , _ i.e. _ the longhitano s lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "we have considered a low - energy effective theory containing the sm gauge bosons coupled to the electroweak goldstones , one light scalar state @xmath4 with mass @xmath14  gev and the lightest vector and axial - vector resonance multiplets @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we have only assumed the sm pattern of ewsb , _",
    "i.e. _ the theory is symmetric under @xmath17 and becomes spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath4 is taken to be singlet under @xmath18 , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are triplets .",
    "the underlying theory is also assumed to preserve parity in this analysis . to build the lagrangian we have only considered operators with the lowest number of derivatives , as higher - derivative terms are either proportional to the equations of motion or",
    "tend to violate the expected short - distance behaviour  @xcite . in order to determine the oblique @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters one only needs the interactions  @xcite @xmath19 { \\,\\rangle}\\nonumber   + \\frac{f_a}{2\\sqrt{2 } } { \\langle \\,}a_{\\mu\\nu } f^{\\mu\\nu}_- { \\,\\rangle}+ \\sqrt{2 } \\lambda_1^{ha }   \\partial_\\mu h   { \\langle \\,}a^{\\mu \\nu } u_\\nu { \\,\\rangle}\\ , , \\phantom{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] plus the standard gauge boson and resonance kinetic terms .",
    "we have followed the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite . the first term in ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) gives the goldstone lagrangian , present in the sm , plus the scalar - goldstone interactions . for @xmath20",
    "one recovers the @xmath21 vertex of the sm .",
    "the oblique parameter @xmath1 receives tree - level contributions from vector and axial - vector exchanges @xcite , while @xmath2 is identically zero at lowest - order ( lo ) : @xmath22    to compute next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions we have used the dispersive representation of @xmath1 introduced by peskin and takeuchi  @xcite , whose convergence requires a vanishing spectral function at short distances : @xmath23\\ , , \\label{sintegral}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 the spectral function of the @xmath25 correlator  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath2 is simplified by noticing that , up to corrections of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , being @xmath28 and @xmath29 the wave - function renormalization constants of the charged and neutral goldstone bosons computed in the landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "a further simplification occurs by setting @xmath30 to zero , which does not break the custodial symmetry , so only the @xmath31-boson exchange produces an effect in @xmath2 .",
    "this approximation captures the lowest order contribution to @xmath2 in its expansion in powers of @xmath30 and @xmath11 .    requiring the @xmath32 spectral function @xmath33 to vanish at high energies channel by channel leads to a good convergence of the goldstone self - energies , at least for the cuts we have considered .",
    "then , their difference obeys an unsubtracted dispersion relation , which enables us to compute @xmath2 through the dispersive integral  @xcite , @xmath34 \\ , , \\label{tintegral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 the spectral function of the difference of the neutral and charged goldstone self - energies .",
    "it is quite interesting to remark the main assumptions we have done in our approach :    1 .",
    "only operators with * at most two derivatives * have been kept in the action .",
    "considering the equations of motion , field redefinitions and the high - energy behavior of form factors , it is possible to justify the absence of higher derivative operators  @xcite .",
    "this procedure works very well in the qcd case  @xcite .",
    "2 .   only the * lightest vector and axial - vector resonance * multiplets",
    "have been considered .",
    "qcd phenomenology supports this `` single - resonance '' approximation , owing to the kinematical suppression of heavier resonance contributions  @xcite .",
    "3 .   only contributions to the dispersive relations of ( [ sintegral ] ) and ( [ tintegral ] ) coming from the * lightest two - particle channels without heavy resonances *",
    "have been considered , _",
    "i.e. _ two goldstones or one goldstone plus one higgs - like scalar resonance for @xmath1 and the @xmath31 boson plus one goldstone or one higgs - like scalar resonance for @xmath2 . note that contributions from higher cuts are kinematically suppressed : the @xmath36 or @xmath37 weights in the sum rules ( [ sintegral ] ) and ( [ tintegral ] ) enhance the contribution from the lightest thresholds and suppress channels with heavy states  @xcite . @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 contributions were shown to be suppressed in a previous higgsless analysis  @xcite .",
    "again , it is known that this procedure gives a very good approximation to the corresponding integrals in the qcd case  @xcite .",
    "4 .   unlike what happens in qcd , the underlying theory is not known .",
    "therefore , although we have worked at lowest order in @xmath30 and @xmath11 , the perturbative * chiral counting * in powers of momenta is not well defined .",
    "we only know that loops are suppressed ( @xmath40 counting in the loop expansion ) and that it works in qcd in the framework of the @xmath41 expansion , with @xmath42 the number of colours .",
