    "since a quantum position measurement by a mesoscopic detector can be described within the same theoretical framework as a qubit measurement , one might ask if such a bound also exists in the case of a position measurement . in this article , we first show that , for fixed system parameters , the peak - to - background ratio in the spectral density of a position detector weakly coupled to an oscillator is also bounded from above .",
