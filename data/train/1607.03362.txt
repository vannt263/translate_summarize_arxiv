    "in the 21st century , it is a major challenge to fulfill the demand of electricity for everyone .",
    "currently maximum part of electricity is generated by using various types of heat engines like subcritical coal fired power station ( maximum efficiency = 42 % @xcite ) , supercritical coal fired power station ( maximum efficiency = 49 % ) , etc .",
    "so more than half of supplied energy is released directly to the environment as waste heat .",
    "this waste heat can be converted into electricity by using themoelectric ( te ) generators . the conversion efficiency of te materials depends on the figure - of - merit ( zt ) .",
    "more is the value of zt , higher will be the efficiency of material.@xcite zt of any te material is calculated by using the following formula , @xmath4    where @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and t are seebeck coefficient , electrical resistivity , thermal conductivity , and absolute temperature , respectively . from above equation it is clear that the zt is proportional to square of @xmath0 and hence it plays an important role in calculating the value of zt .",
    "the seebeck coefficient depends on transport properties of charge carriers and thus affected by impurity , defects , and phase transformation in materials.@xcite so , we need an instrument which should be capable of measuring the @xmath0 in a wide temperature range with fairly good accuracy at low cost and capable to characterize a wide variety of samples with various dimensions .    the seebeck coefficient is determined in two ways : integral and differential methods . in integral method ,",
    "one end of the sample is kept at a fixed temperature ( @xmath7 ) and temperature of the other end ( @xmath8 ) is tuned to the desired range .",
    "sv generated in the sample is recorded as a function of temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the seebeck coefficient of the sample relative to the connecting wire at any temperature can be obtained from the slope of the sv versus temperature curve at that temperature .",
    "large sv is generated due to the large temperature difference across the sample ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this large sv minimizes the error due to the presence of small spurious voltage generated in the measurement circuit.@xcite the requirement of additional cooling system to keep one end of sample at fixed temperature increases the complexity of the instrument along with the cost .",
    "integral method is not applicable for nondegenerate semiconductors and insulators.@xcite    in differential method , seebeck coefficient is calculated by the given equation , @xmath9 where @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are absolute seebeck coefficient of the sample , measured sv , and seebeck coefficient of connecting wire , respectively .",
    "this is the conventional method of seebeck coefficient measurement .",
    "there is no need of any additional cooling system in this method .",
    "differential method is suitable for any type of materials . due to the reason described above , the differential method is used in the most of the instruments for @xmath1 measurement.@xcite low seebeck coefficient materials ( copper , niobium , and platinum )",
    "are used as connecting wire to measure sv and thermocouples are used to measure temperatures .",
    "inherent accuracy of thermocouple may also leads to inaccuracy in temperature measurement.@xcite inaccurate measurement of temperatures may also cause inaccuracy in @xmath2 measurement , which can change the @xmath1 largely in the case of low @xmath2 . to measure the temperature and sv , connecting wire and thermocouple should be fixed at the exactly same point of sample , which is a major difficulty.@xcite    to overcome these limitations , _ boor et al .",
    "_ suggested a different equation given below , which can be derived by using the conventional equation . @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are measured sv using positive legs , negative legs , seebeck coefficient of thermocouple and seebeck coefficient of its negative leg , respectively . in this equation",
    ", sv is measured using thermocouple legs only and no additional wires are required .",
    "this resolve the difficulty in the measurement of temperature and sv at exactly the same point of sample .",
    "the use of thermocouple as connecting wire also simplified the design of the instrument . employing eqn .",
    "3 over eqn . 2 is highly advantageous for several reasons .",
    "firstly , spurious thermal offset voltages from the system are cancelled .",
    "secondly , the equation requires no direct temperature measurements , which tend to be less accurate than voltage measurements.@xcite temperature measurements are required only to find the value of @xmath17 ( mean temperature ) , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where accuracy is less important .",
    "extra effort is required to find the value of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "3 is used in very few papers for @xmath1 measurement.@xcite out of them _ _ kolb et al.__@xcite and _ _ boor et al.__@xcite found the value of @xmath15 and @xmath16 using the equations , given below @xmath18 above approximation is valid in two cases ( i ) @xmath2 should be small@xcite and ( ii ) seebeck coefficient of the positive and negative legs should have linear temperature dependence . for wide temperature range ,",
    "case ( ii ) is difficult to satisfy so , eqn .",
    "3 is limited to the small @xmath2 with above approximation .",
    "maintaining a small @xmath2 at high temperature is difficult to satisfy and may require an additional heater at cold side and temperature controller .",
    "this also makes the measurement process complex and increases the cost of setup .    in the present work ,",
    "we have addressed above issues and developed a low cost fully automated instrument to measure @xmath1 .",
    "the seebeck coefficient of thermocouple and its negative leg has been calculated by integrating the temperature dependent values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . a single thin heater is used to heat the sample and @xmath2 across the sample is generated due to its thermal conductivity .",
    "this heater provides high temperature at low power supply compared to bulk heater .",
    "it also simplifies the sample holder design due to its small size .",
    "the sample holder is lightweight and small in size , in which limited components are used .",
    "each component of the sample holder is fabricated separately , which provides us liberty to replace any part if it gets damaged .",
    "its simple design makes loading and unloading of the sample easier and is capable of holding samples of various dimensions .",
    "the labview based program is built to automize the measurement process .",
    "iron , constantan , bismuth and @xmath3 samples are used to validate the instrument .",
    "the data collected on these samples are found to be in good agreement with the reported data .",
    "theoretically , sv across a sample ( @xmath19 ) can be written as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are hot side temperature , cold side temperature , and seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature .",
    "connecting wires are required to measure sv across the sample .",
    "the temperature difference is also generated across both connecting wires , which adds its own sv in the measured voltage as shown in fig .",
    "the free ends of both connecting wires are at temperature @xmath24 .    from fig .",
    "1 , the expression for measured voltage ( @xmath25 ) in - terms of sample voltage ( @xmath19 ) , cold side wire voltage ( @xmath26 ) , and hot side wire voltage ( @xmath27 ) can be written as , @xmath28 by using eqn .",
    "6 , we can write the expression for @xmath26 and @xmath27 as , @xmath29    now , by putting the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 from eqns . 8 and 9 , respectively in eqn . 7 , we get @xmath30    if @xmath31 is net sv due to both connecting wires , then from eqn . 10 , it can be written as , @xmath32 so the effective seebeck coefficient of connecting wire can be written as @xmath33 using the above equation , we can calculate @xmath11 accurately .",
    "thermocouple is having the same boundary condition like connecting wire .",
    "so , the equation derived above can be written for thermocouple also .",
    "@xmath34    for conventional method , only @xmath11 is required , while for equation suggested by _",
    "boor et al .",
    "_ , @xmath11 as well as @xmath15 are required .",
    "@xmath11 represents the seebeck coefficient of connecting wire , if negative leg of thermocouple is used , it will be written as @xmath16 . in this work , from now",
    "onward seebeck coefficient of connecting wire is indicated as @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that the method proposed in the present work is expected to be better than that of _ boor et al .",
    "_ for the general type of thermocouples and for a large value of @xmath2 .",
