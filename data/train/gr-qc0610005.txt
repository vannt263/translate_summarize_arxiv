    "both the simultaneity of clocks located at different places and the equality of durations are important problems in research about time .",
    "poincar thought that the two problems are related to each other , and that they can only acquire meaning by convention .",
    "he guessed that one could solve the problems by the convention that the velocity of light might be isotropic and might be a constant in empty space@xcite[1,2,3,4 ] .",
    "in the theory of the relativity , einstein defined the simultaneity of clocks located at different places by the convention that the velocity of light is homogeneous and isotropic , and it is a universal constant in empty space@xcite .",
    "landau pointed out that one can define globally the simultaneity of coordinate time only in a time - orthogonal frame@xcite .",
    "however they did not discuss how to define the equality of durations of a clock .",
    "we find that the synchronization of the moment of clocks located at different places and the synchronization of the rate of these clocks are different .",
    "the synchronization of the moment of clocks at different places might be difficult , while synchronization of their rate turns out easier .",
    "we suggested a new programme to synchronize the rate of clocks , where we do not synchronize the moment of the clocks . following the convention on the velocity of light given by poincar , einstein and landau",
    ", we got the condition of transitivity of synchronization of clock rate . in the space - time where the condition is valid",
    ", we can define the identical `` clock rate '' in the whole space - time , although there may not exist `` simultaneous hypersurfaces '' . in those papers",
    ", we stressed the synchronization of rates of clocks located at different space points@xcite .    in this paper , with the programme to synchronize the rate of coordinate clocks ,",
    "we define the equality of durations of a clock by the above convention on velocity of light . as a result ,",
    "we not only answer the first problem on the measurement of time advanced by poincar ( i.e. the definition on synchronization of clocks in different space points ) , but also find the solution to his second problem ( i.e. the definition of the equality of durations ) .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in the sec.2 , we introduce poincar s ideas about measurement of time . in the sec.3 and sec.4 , we present the results of research on simultaneity given by einstein , landau and others",
    ". then we give the result of research on synchronization of rate of clocks in sec.5 . in sec.6",
    ", we get the definition on the equality of durations . in the sec.7 ,",
    "short conclusion and discussion are given .",
    "how to define the simultaneity of two events occurring at two different places ? how to define the equality of two durations ?",
    "these two important basic questions have been discussed by many famous philosophers , physicists and mathematicians .",
    "henri poincar gave inspired analysis on them before the birth of a. einstein s theory of relativity@xcite .    in `` the measure of time '' ( 1898 ) and `` the value of science '' ( 1905 ) poincar pointed out : `` we have not a direct intuition of simultaneity nor of the equality of two durations ( time intervals ) '' .",
    "`` it is difficult to separate the qualitative problem of simultaneity from the quantitative problem of the measurement of time . ''",
    "`` the qualitative problem of simultaneity is made of depend upon the quantitative problem of the measurement of time . ''    in `` science and hypothesis '' ( 1902 ) poincar wrote :     ( 1 ) .",
    "there is no absolute space ,  ",
    "( 2)there is no absolute time .",
    "when we say that two periods are equal , the statement has no meaning , and can only acquire a meaning by a convention .",
    "( 3)not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods , but we have not even direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring at two different places .",
    "    poincar thought that not only the equality of two durations but also the simultaneity of two events occurring at two different places can only acquire meaning by convention .",
    "`` this convention , however , is not absolutely arbitrary ; it is not the child of our caprice .we admit it because certain experiments have shown us that it will be convenient ,   ''",
    "`` the simultaneity of two events , or the order of their succession , the equality of two durations , are to be so defined that the enunciation of the natural laws may be as simple as possible ,   ''",
    "a. einstein agrees with poincar s idea that the simultaneity of two events occurring at two different places can only acquire meaning by convention . because `` physics '' is a science depending on experiment and measurement , so any definitions based on convention about the simultaneity must be operable in experiment and measurement . in the theory of `` relativity '' , einstein gave a definition of the simultaneity based on the convention that the space is homogeneous and isotropic for light propagation and that the velocity of light is a universal constant in empty space@xcite .    in `` on the electrodynamics of moving bodies '' ( 1905 )",
    "he wrote :     we have so far defined only an `` a time '' and a `` b time '' .",
    "we have not defined a common `` time '' for a and b , for the latter can not be defined at all unless we establish by _ definition _ that the `` time '' required by light to travel from a to b equals the `` time '' it requires to travel from b to a. let a ray of light start at the `` a time '' @xmath0 from a towards b. let it at the `` b time '' @xmath1 be reflected at b in the direction of a , and arrive again at a at the `` a time''@xmath2 .    in accordance with definition",
    "the two clocks synchronize if    @xmath3    we assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions , and possible for any number of points ; and that the following relations are universally valid:    \\1 . if the clock at b synchronizes with the clock at a , the clock at a synchronizes with the clock at b.    \\2 . if the clock at a synchronizes with the clock at b and also with the clock at c , the clocks at b and c also synchronize with each other .",
    "thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have settled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks located at different places , and have evidently obtained a definition of `` simultaneous , '' or `` synchronous , '' of `` time . ''",
    "the `` time '' of an event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a stationary clock located at the place of the event , this clock being synchronous , and indeed synchronous for all time determinations , with a specified stationary clock .    in agreement with experience",
    "we further assume the quantity @xmath4 to be a universal constant  the velocity of light in empty space.    in einstein s above theory , eq.([1 ] ) can be re - written as @xmath5 the `` a time '' @xmath6@xmath7 is defined as the `` simultaneous '' moment with the `` b time '' @xmath8    with this way , einstein defined `` simultaneity '' or `` synchronism '' of any number of stationary clocks located at different places in a inertial frame .",
    "it can be proved that the above definition and hypotheses are free from contradictions in inertial frames .",
    "however , the `` hypothesis 2 '' may be invalid in an arbitrary reference system in a curved space - time , or even in a non - inertial frame in a flat space - time .",
    "it has been proved that the `` hypothesis 2 '' is valid only in time - orthogonal frames@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that even in a time - orthogonal frame , in general , one can synchronize only the `` coordinate clocks '' over all space , not the `` standard clocks '' . in other words , one only can globally define `` the simultaneity of the coordinate time '' but not `` the simultaneity of the proper time '' in time - orthogonal frames in general .",
    "let us discuss the possibility of synchronizing clocks at different points over all space , i.e. the possibility of `` hypothesis 2 '' being valid@xcite .",
    "suppose a light signal travel from some point a in space to another point b infinitely near to it and then back along the same path .",
    "l and m are world lines of point a and point b respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . let the light signal start at the `` a time '' @xmath9 from a towards b , then it at the `` b time '' @xmath8 is reflected at b in the direction of a and arrives again at a at the `` a time '' @xmath10let @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13        following einstein ( sec.2 ) , one can define `` a time '' @xmath14 being the simultaneous moment with `` b time''@xmath15 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) into eq.([7 ] ) , one has @xmath16    \\label{8}\\ ] ]    let us write the interval , separating the space and time coordinates , of two events , as @xmath17    as the interval between the two events corresponds to the departure and arrival of the light signal from one point to the other , it is equal to zero . solving the equation @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 ,",
    "one finds two roots : @xmath20 corresponding to the propagation of the light signal in the two directions between a and b. so , we have @xmath21    substituting eq.([11 ] ) into eq.([8 ] ) , one gets @xmath22    one finds that there exists a difference in the values of the coordinate time t for two simultaneous moments at infinitely near points .",
    "eq.([12 ] ) enables people to synchronize clocks located at infinitely near points of space . carrying out a similar synchronization , one can synchronize clocks located at different points alone any open curves of space , i.e. one can define simultaneity of moments along any open curve",
    ". however synchronization of clocks along a closed contour turns out to be impossible in general , because @xmath23 is different from zero when one synchronizes clocks starting out along the contour and returning to the initial point .",
    "in fact , one has @xmath24    hence it is impossible to synchronize clocks over all space unless the reference system is time - orthogonal @xmath25 or @xmath26",
    "in ref.@xcite , we gave another kind of clock synchronization , where we do not demand to synchronize `` simultaneous moments '' of coordinate clocks , only demand to synchronize `` rates '' of coordinate clocks .    now let us give the condition on the transitivity of synchronization of clock rate .",
    "at the first simultaneous moment of the space points a and b , the time difference of their coordinate clocks is @xmath27    at the second simultaneous moment , the time difference is @xmath28    the difference between the rates of the two clocks can be given : @xmath29 @xmath30 dx^i   \\label{18}\\ ] ]    therefore the rates of coordinate clocks are the same everywhere , or the synchronization of clock rate is transitive , if and only if @xmath31 or @xmath32    that means @xmath33 or @xmath34    eq.([21 ] ) requires that the integral along a closed path is a constant independent of time : @xmath35    of course , the constant in the eq.([23 ] ) could be non - zero .",
    "this is a weaker condition than that of time - orthogonality .",
    "obviously , eq.(21 ) is only a necessary condition , but not a sufficient condition for constructing simultaneity surfaces .    in the whole space ",
    "time which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) but not eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , one can synchronize all clocks such that rates of the coordinate clocks are the same everywhere , or the synchronization of clock rate is transitive . but the simultaneity is not transitive , or one can not construct simultaneity surfaces globally in the whole space - time .",
    "the simultaneity of two events occurring at two different places and the transitivity of simultaneity have been defined , by einstein , poincar , landau and others on the foundation of the convention that the velocity of light is homogeneous and isotropic , and is a universal constant in empty space .",
    "obversely , these important convention and definitions are operable in experiment and measurement .",
    "now , let us discuss the issue about `` the equality of two durations '' , i.e. `` the equality of two periods or two time intervals '' .",
    "poincar thought that this problem of the measurement of time is related to the problem of simultaneity .",
    "we want to point out that we can define `` the equality of two durations '' based on the same convention about the velocity of light in empty space , and that this definition is also operable in experiment and measurement .",
    "let an observer with a light source and a mirror rest at a fixed space point a in a stationary space - time , and another observer with a mirror rest at the point b infinitely near to a. l and m are respectively the world - lines of the observers resting at the points a and b ( fig.2 ) .",
    "let the observer a emit a light signal at the  a time ",
    "@xmath9 towards b. the signal is reflected by the mirror of the observer b at the `` b time '' @xmath36 in the direction of a , and the light signal arrives again at a at the `` a time '' @xmath37 .",
    "when the light signal goes to b and back to a , the difference of the coordinate time is @xmath38        at the same moment ( @xmath39 receiving the light signal reflected by b , the mirror a reflects again the signal in the direction of b. the light signal arrives again at b at the `` b time''@xmath40 , then it is reflected and comes back to a at the `` a time''@xmath41,  . the travel of the light signal to and fro between a and b can be regarded as a period of time .",
    "the duration of the first period is shown in eq.([24 ] ) .",
    "the duration of second period is : @xmath42 @xmath43 the duration of the nth period is : @xmath44 there is no any reason to think that the `` durations '' of the above periods are different , because the space - time is stationary .",
    "so , one has    @xmath45    i.e. @xmath46    consequently , we give a definition on the equality of durations in a stationary space - time .",
    "discussion :    \\(i ) because the distance between the point b and the point a is arbitrary selected , we can define the equality of durations of any length .",
    "\\(ii ) the durations discussed above are the durations of coordination time .",
    "the relation between the duration of coordinate time dt and the duration of proper time d@xmath47 is @xmath48    we have the conclusion that the durations of the proper time of a resting observer , shown by eq.([29 ] ) , are equal , that is @xmath49 because @xmath50 is independent of time t in stationary space times .",
    "\\(iii ) we can generalize the definition on `` the equality of durations '' to the whole space - time , and get the conclusion that the durations of coordinate time are equal in the whole stationary space  time , because the condition ( ( [ 19 ] ) or ( [ 20 ] ) ) of `` transitivity of synchronization of clock rate '' is valid in any stationary space - times . from eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) , we know that the durations of proper time of the different observers located at the different space points are not equal in general , owing to @xmath50 being a function depending on space points .",
    "let @xmath51 be a congruence of the world - lines of a family of static observers a , b , c ,  in a curved space - time ( fig.3 ) .",
    "it means that a coordinate system covering @xmath51 is selected , where @xmath51 is just the congruence of the time coordinate curves .",
    "we assume the synchronization of clock rates is transitive , but the coordinate system is not time - orthogonal .",
    "let us synchronize clocks along a closed space contour with a light signal following einstein and landau .",
    "we know from eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) that the `` b time '' @xmath8 of the point b near a is defined as the simultaneous moment of the `` a time '' @xmath9 when the time difference of the two simultaneous moments is given as @xmath52        similarly , we can define the `` c time '' @xmath53 of the point c near b as the simultaneous moment of the `` b time '' @xmath8,  . when we synchronize clocks along the closed space contour returning to the initial point a , we find that the simultaneous moment , shown by the clock a , is @xmath54 , which is different from @xmath9 , the difference of the two simultaneous moments is @xmath55    using the same method , we continue to synchronize clocks along the same closed contour , we have @xmath56 @xmath43 @xmath57    owing to the coordinate system being not time orthogonal , we have @xmath58 but we know that , from eqs.([19])-([23 ] ) , @xmath59    because the synchronization of clock rate is transitive in the coordinate systems , we get the equal time periods from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , etc",
    ". we can define the equal periods as the equal durations .",
    "thus we obtain the equal  time intervals  of the observer a.    it is easy to know that the constant @xmath64 in eq.([36 ] ) will be different when we synchronize clocks along different closed space contours . because we can select arbitrary contour to synchronize clocks , so we can get arbitrary value of @xmath65it means that we can define arbitrary length of  equality of duration ",
    ", i.e. arbitrary length of  equality of time intervals  . certainly , that is the duration of coordinate time .",
    "the relation between the coordinate time t and the proper time @xmath47 of the observer a is @xmath66 because a rests in the coordinate system .",
    "therefore , we can define  length  of the durations of proper time by means of @xmath67    in other words , we can parameterize the world line with the duration of proper time @xmath68 given by eq.([38 ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that eq.(36 ) is based upon the condition on the transitivity of synchronization of clock rate .",
    "our original purpose suggesting the notion of `` the transitivity of synchronization of clock rate '' is to find the coordinate clocks whose rates are the same in the whole space .",
    "it means that the `` time periods '' of the same kind of periodic motion are the same through the whole space time .",
    "here we want to emphasize that the condition on the transitivity of synchronization of clock rate is not only the condition of the equality of the rates of clocks located at different space points , but also the condition of the equality of durations of a clock .",
    "therefore , the condition not only solves the question about the definition of the synchronization of rate of clocks located at different space points , but also solves the question about the definition of the equality of two durations .",
    "it means that the condition on transitivity of synchronization of clock rate is the condition to define identical , equal time intervals through the whole space time .",
