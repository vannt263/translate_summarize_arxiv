    "the study of the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in gravitational fields plays an essential role in relativistic astrophysics and cosmology . in order to obtain a correct and consistent description of the radiative transfer processes for photons propagating on cosmological distances or on the cosmic microwave background one must also take into account the effects of the background geometry on the radiation emitted near the surface of neutrons stars or black holes @xcite .",
    "the radiation follows curved paths according to the underlying geometry and is red or blue - shifted .",
    "spatial curvature in some geometries , like , for example , the kerr geometry , rotates the polarization of photons propagating through them .    generally , one can not solve maxwell s equations exactly for waves propagating in curved space - times or in a relativistic medium .",
    "instead one either uses a geometrical optics approximation or a kinetic description of the multi - photon system , by treating photons as massless classical particles , characterized by a four - momentum @xmath0 at an event @xmath1 @xcite . in the geometrical optics approximation , which is reasonable in most of the cases , the degree of polarization is not affected by the underlying geometry .",
    "the field vector propagate parallel along the light paths . for non - flat curved paths , a rotation of the polarization angle results .",
    "astrophysicists measure intensities and spectral distributions . these can conveniently be described by a distribution function , which is defined on phase space and is directly related to the spectral intensity . in this picture",
    "the propagation of radiation is described by an equation of radiative transfer , which is a differential equation for the photon distribution function .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned quantities , degrees and plane of polarization of the observed radiation provide important means of information about the source and the intervening medium and geometry .",
    "a general relativistic form of the boltzmann transport equation for particles or radiation interacting with an external medium has been developed by lindquist @xcite .",
    "the comoving frame radiation transfer equation in an eulerian coordinate system was obtained by riffert @xcite .",
    "a transport equation for photons in curved riemannian space - times was derived by bildhauer @xcite , by making use of the covariant generalization of the wigner transformation .",
    "two linear equations on the tangent bundle are obtained whose correction terms to the liouville equation and the classical mass - shell condition are of the order of the wavelength over the variation length of the background geometry .",
    "the comoving frame transfer equation for the stokes parameters in an arbitrary background metric in an eulerian coordinate system has been obtained in @xcite and applied to the study of the berry s phase for polarized light in @xcite .",
    "a long time ago brans @xcite has suggested that a rotation of the polarization plane of the radiation arises whenever there is shear , by an effect analogous to the thomas precession .",
    "therefore if there is a large scale anisotropy in the expansion of the universe , the microwave background radiation is expected to be linearly polarized . in friedmann - robertson - walker models with small expansion anisotropy",
    "the observed rotation of the polarization plane would be appreciable and constant over the celestial sphere in closed ( bianchi type ix ) models or it should vanish in flat ( type i ) and open ( type v ) models @xcite .",
    "hence the study of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation can imposes strong limits on the anisotropy and other fundamental physical parameters of the universe .",
    "a rigorous first order solution with respect to the anisotropy for the equation of polarized radiation transfer in a homogeneous anisotropic universe was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization of the background radiation is very sensitive to the recombination dynamics and to the reheating epoch . for a bianchi type - ii space - time with a frozen - in magnetic field the polarization and anisotropy properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation have been studied in @xcite .",
    "faraday - rotation effects , such as the rotation of the linear polarization plane , are found to be independent of the spatial curvature effect and are thus the same as in type - i models .    almost immediately after the birth of general relativity ( gr ) , more general geometries , with non - metricity and torsion ,",
    "have been proposed by weyl and cartan , in order to incorporate in a geometric framework the effects of the electromagnetism and of the angular momentum .",
    "later one , these extensions of the classical gr have been incorporated in the different gauge theoretical formulations of gravity @xcite .",
    "there are different gauge theories of gravity in dependence of the choice of the gravitational gauge group and of the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "one of the most studied gauge theory of gravity is the poincar gauge theory , which requires a generalization of the riemannian geometry and the introduction of the torsion of the space - time @xcite .",
    "non - symmetric gravitation theories , in which the gravitational field is described by a non - symmetric metric tensor , whose antisymmetric part couples directly to the electromagnetic field , have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the study of the propagation of light in a gravitational field has provided the classic observational tests of general relativity .",
    "the modifications of the geometry due to the non - riemannian effects , like torsion and non - metricity , further affect the motion of photons , by inducing a birefringence of the vacuum which can modify the polarization of the photons as they propagate through the gravitational field .",
    "thus the study of the polarization of photons from astrophysical or cosmological sources can provide a valuable tool for discriminating between the different modifications and extensions of general relativity .",
    "ni @xcite has shown that non - metric gravitational fields can single out linear polarization states of light that propagate with different speeds .",
    "he also proposed to use pulsar polarization data to impose constraints on non - metric theories .",
    "limits on the gravity - induced polarization of the zeeman components of the solar spectral lines have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the polarization of light from magnetic white dwarfs can be used to impose constraints on the gravity - induced birefringence of space in nonmetric gravitational theories @xcite . by using the magnetic white dwarf grw+70@xmath2",
    "8247 polarization data one can obtain the constraint @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the non - symmetric gravitational theory charge .    in conventional maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics ,",
    "the propagation of light is influenced by the metric only , and not by the torsion @xmath5 of the space - time .",
    "however , there is a possibility of interaction between light and torsion if the latter is non - minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field @xmath6 by means of a lagrangian of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a coupling constant .",
    "several such couplings have been proposed and analyzed recently .",
    "a supplementary lagrangian of the form @xmath9 was considered in @xcite , and it was shown that it can yield birefringence in the vacuum .",
    "non - minimally coupled homogeneous and isotropic torsion field in a friedmann - robertson - walker geometry affects the speed of light , with the photons propagating with a torsion - dependent speed .",
    "in fact , torsion generates three major effects affecting the propagation of light : it produces an axion field that induces an optical activity into space - time , modifies the light cone structure that yields birefringence of the vacuum and modifies the speed of light in a torsion - dependent way @xcite .",
    "an example of a metric - affine gauge theory of gravity in which torsion couples nonminimally to the electromagnetic field was considered in @xcite .",
    "the coupling causes a phase difference to accumulate between different polarization states of light as they propagate through the metric - affine gravitational field .",
    "the model has been constrained by using solar spectropolarimetric observations , which allow to set an upper bound on the relevant coupling constant @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the confirmation that at least some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are indeed at cosmological distances raises the possibility that observations of these could provide interesting constraints on the fundamental laws of physics ( for reviews on grbs see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the fine - scale time structure and hard spectra of grb emissions are very sensitive to the possible dispersion of electromagnetic waves in vacuo .",
    "hence the study of short - duration photon bursts propagating over cosmological distances is the most promising way to probe the quantum gravitational and/or the effects related to the existence of extra - dimensions @xcite .",
    "the modification of the group velocity of the photons by the quantum effects would affect the simultaneity of the arrival times of photons with different energies .",
    "thus , given a distant , transient source of photons , one could measure the differences in the arrival times of sharp transitions in the signals in different energy bands and use this information to constrain quantum gravity and/or multidimensional effects @xcite .",
    "the announcement of the results of the polarization measurements of the prompt gamma - rays and of the optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts attracted a great interests recently .",
    "coburn and boggs @xcite claimed the measurement of a very large linear polarization , @xmath12 , of the prompt gamma - rays from an extremely bright burst , grb 021206 .",
    "however , this polarization measurement has been criticized by rutledge and fox @xcite , who obtained an upper limit of only @xmath13 at @xmath14 confidence from the same data , while in wigger et al .",
    "@xcite a value of 41% ( + 57% -44% ) is found .",
    "one the other hand , the polarization measurements of the optical afterglows are much more convincing .",
    "the first positive detection of the polarization was for grb 990510 with the degree of @xmath15 , and since then polarized emission has been measured in several other afterglows ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to generalize the transport equations for polarized radiation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the case of the polarized radiation propagating in a space - time manifold with non - riemannian geometry .",
    "more exactly , we shall consider the case of the so - called weyl - cartan space - times , whose geometrical structure is described by three tensors : the metric , the torsion and the non - metricity @xcite . in this case the propagation equations for the radiation distribution function , for the stokes parameters , for the linear polarization and for the degree of the total polarization can be formulated as a system of a first order partial differential equations on the photon phase - space , with the non - riemannian effects included via the contorsion tensor .",
    "as an astrophysical application of the obtained equations we consider the propagation of gamma ray bursts in a non - riemannian geometrical background .",
    "the general solution of the propagation equation for the total polarization degree can be obtained in an exact form .",
    "the presence of a non - riemannian geometrical background , in which the electromagnetic fields couple to torsion and/or non - metricity affect the polarization of photon beams .",
    "the polarization of the beam is generally a function of time , with non - riemannian effects induced via the contorsion tensor .",
    "since most of the gamma ray bursts have a cosmological origin , due to the long propagation times , the influence of the torsion and non - metricity could significantly affect their polarization .",
    "therefore we suggest that the observed polarization of the prompt gamma ray bursts and of their optical afterglows could also contain a propagation effect component , due to a torsion / non - metricity induced birefringence of the vacuum .",
    "if such a component could be unambiguously detected , this would provide a significant test for the existence of the non - riemannian geometrical effects in our universe . however , there are many conventional astrophysical mechanisms that could explain the polarization of the gamma ray bursts , and affect the propagation of the electromagnetic radiation . the uncertainties in the knowledge of the astrophysical environment in which photons propagate , and",
    "the difficulty in separating the different physical effects contributing to the polarization of the gamma ray bursts make the practical detection of the torsion or non - metricity an extremely difficult and very challenging observational task .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the transport equations for polarized light in weyl - cartan space - times are derived in section ii .",
    "the general solution for the total polarization degree for a homogeneous and isotropic background geometry is obtained in section iii .",
    "constraints on torsion and non - metricity obtained from the observed polarization of gamma ray bursts are obtained in section iv . in section v we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "relativistic transport theory finds its most elegant and natural expression in terms of geometric structures defined in the tangent bundle over the space - time manifold .",

    "the curvature operator is defined as @xmath27 } \\left ( s\\right ) $ ] , where @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a local frame defined on each neighborhood @xmath30 .",
    "the curvature operator satisfies the properties of multi - linearity , anti - symmetry and tensoriality .",
    "the torsion operator on @xmath24 is defined as @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "this is a vector field with components @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the christoffel symbols on @xmath24 and @xmath34 is the torsion tensor @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that the space - time manifold @xmath16 is equipped with a conformal structure , i.e. with a class @xmath35 $ ] of conformally equivalent lorentz metrics ( and not a definite metric as in general relativity ) .",
    "this corresponds to the requirement that it should only be possible to compare lengths at one and the same world point .",
    "we also suppose that the connection @xmath25 respects the conformal structure .",
    "differentially this means that for any @xmath36 $ ] the covariant derivative @xmath37 should be proportional to @xmath17 : @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 is a differential 1-form and @xmath41 is called the non - metricity @xcite . a change of calibration of the metric induces a gauge transformation for @xmath42 : @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "therefore in terms of the torsion and non - metricity the connection @xmath45 on @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the christoffel symbol computed from the metric @xmath17 by using the general relativistic prescription , @xmath48 .",

    "all these solutions are strongly model - dependent and generally have a complicated mathematical form .    on the other hand the study of the polarization of the prompt cosmological gamma ray bursts and of their afterglows offers , at least in principle , the possibility of observationally testing poincar type gauge theories .    assuming , as an extreme and perhaps unrealistic case , that the initial gamma ray emission is totally unpolarized , as predicted by some models of the gamma ray burst emission ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein )",
    ", the detected polarization amount could be mainly due to the propagation effects of the photons travelling on cosmological distances in a non - riemannian geometrical background .",
    "the presence of the contorsion in the radiation transport equations in curved space - times could generate a supplementary polarization of the photon beam .",
    "if the polarization of the gamma ray bursts is indeed due to the coupling between photons and geometry , then the observed degree of the polarization must be redshift - dependent , since photons travelling on longer distances will be more affected .",
    "the smallness of the observed effect even for high redshift sources ( @xmath319 ) also seems to suggest mainly a propagation effect .    a second important effect , which follows from the consideration of the non - riemannian structure of the space - time is related to the prediction of the frequency dependence of the polarization of gamma ray bursts .",
    "since the dependence of the frequency is logarithmic , the total polarization degree of the gamma ray component should be smaller by a factor of around @xmath320 than the polarization degree of the optical afterglow emission .",
    "together with the cosmological redshift dependence , the frequency dependence of the polarization degree of gamma ray bursts provides a clear observational signature of the possible presence of non - riemannian , weyl - cartan type geometrical features in our universe .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial polarization degree of the gamma ray bursts could be exactly predicted by some photon emission models , then the comparison of the polarization of the gamma ray bursts at the observer and emitter could impose some strong constraints on the deviations of the geometry of the universe with respect to the riemannian background .",
    "the torsional effects generated by the spin fluid modify the background geometry and affects the propagation of the photons .",
    "the study of the polarization of the gamma ray bursts could also impose some limits on the spin density and overall rotation of the universe .",
    "however , the practical implementation of an observational program aiming at detecting torsion and non - metricity from the polarization of the gamma ray bursts could be extremely difficult . from the present observational point of view , the polarization measurements of the gamma ray bursts and the interpretation of the data are still controversial .",
    "there is no general agreement on the detected value of the polarization degree @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , since at the moment the data quality is insufficient to constrain the polarization degree in most of the cases @xcite , a major improvement in the observational techniques is required . on the other hand ,",
    "there are many astrophysical mechanisms which can induce an initial polarization of the photons from the cosmological gamma ray bursts , which makes the task of distinguishing between the different involved physical processes extremely difficult .",
    "the propagation of the photons takes place on cosmological distances in a cosmic environment whose properties also present many uncertainties .",
    "however , when a larger amount of high precision spectropolarimetric data from gamma ray bursts will be available , the possibility of testing the foundations of general relativity and other more general gravitational theories could become a reality .",
