    "it shows higher sensitivity than the absorption measurement  @xcite .",
    "the improved sensitivity is mainly due to the almost complete elimination of the background light .",
    "lin et al . have used faraday rotation method to detect clock signal in a vapor cell to improve its contrast to 90%  @xcite .",
    "we have observed faraday rotation signal in cold @xmath0rb atoms in an integrating sphere and obtained a ramsey fringe whose contrast is 92%  @xcite .",
    "the magneto - optical signal with cold atoms can also be interpreted by larmor s theorem as a sensitive rotation of the atomic wavefunction reflecting the magnetic field , optical magnetometery techniques with rubidium bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have recently been demonstrated with high spatial resolution  @xcite .",
    "then such detection scheme may provide a feasible approach for high contrast cold atom clocks and magnetometers .    in this work , we optimized and modified the previous experiment  @xcite .",
