    "<S> in fiber based fabry - prot cavities ( ffpcs ) , limited spatial mode matching between the cavity mode and input / output modes has been the main hindrance for many applications . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a versatile mode matching method for ffpcs . </S>",
    "<S> our novel design employs an assembly of a graded - index and large core multimode fiber directly spliced to a single mode fiber . </S>",
    "<S> this all - fiber assembly transforms the propagating mode of the single mode fiber to match with the mode of a ffpc . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured a mode matching of 90% for a cavity length of @xmath0400 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a significant improvement compared to conventional ffpcs coupled with just a single mode fiber , especially at long cavity lengths . adjusting the parameters of the assembly , </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental cavity mode can be matched with the mode of almost any single mode fiber , making this approach highly versatile and integrable .    </S>",
    "<S> optical fabry - prot cavities are essential tools for a wide range of applications in science and technology . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , newly developed laser ablation techniques made it possible to fabricate high - quality mirrors directly on the facets of optical fibers , leading to the advent of miniaturized fiber - based fabry - prot cavities ( ffpcs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ffpcs support significantly smaller mode volumes compared to the conventional fabry - prot cavities based on bulk optical mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting quantum mechanical effects have been exploited in atomic @xcite , molecular @xcite , solid state @xcite and optomechanical systems @xcite and are crucial for applications in quantum science and technology . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , due to their compactness and integration with fiber optics , ffpcs have many potential technological applications beyond fundamental scientific research , e.g. , tunable frequency filters @xcite , scanning microscopy @xcite , gas sensing @xcite and micro - fluidics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently several novel laser machining methods have been developed @xcite and detailed characterizations of ffpcs has been carried out @xcite . despite these latest developments , the limited spatial mode matching of ffpcs to their inputs and outputs is still a substantial hindrance for many applications . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to conventional fabry - prot cavities , where mode matching can be achieved with free space optics , this is not possible with ffpcs . </S>",
    "<S> usually , ffpcs are directly coupled to a single mode ( sm ) fiber where the mode matching is simply the overlap between the cavity mode and the output mode emanating from the sm fiber </S>",
    "<S> . there are no controllable elements once the cavity geometry and the type of the sm fiber are fixed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the mode matching efficiencies will be severely limited when the cavity length becomes much longer than the rayleigh range of the output mode of the sm fiber . using large mode field diameter fibers such as photonic crystal fibers @xcite or tapered fibers , which adiabatically transform the fiber mode diameter to that of the cavity </S>",
    "<S> , the mode matching can be improved . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mismatch of the wavefront curvatures ultimately limits the mode matching efficiency .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a novel design of ffpcs which enables optimized mode matching between the cavity and fiber output mode , and which is also free from the constraints of the cavity and fiber geometries . using a concatenation of a graded - index ( grin ) and multimode ( mm ) fibers spliced together </S>",
    "<S> , a versatile all - fiber mode - matching assembly can be built . with this assembly </S>",
    "<S> directly attached to a ffpc , not only the field diameter of the fiber mode but also its wavefront curvature can be precisely engineered to match the mode of the ffpc . as a result , this technique enables the use of almost any optical sm fibers as an input / output for ffpcs in a fully integrated manner . </S>",
    "<S> we have designed , built and characterized a ffpc with integrated mode matching assembly and have measured a mode matching efficiency of up to 90% where the conventional design only achieves @xmath030% .    in order to achieve an optimal mode overlap between an optical cavity and a laser beam in free space , a single lens with an appropriate focal length ( @xmath2 ) has to be located at the right distance ( @xmath3 ) from the position of the cavity ( see fig .  [ fig : realpic ]  ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> our design follows the same concept but in an all - fiber implementation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : realpic ]  ( b ) ) . as the focusing element </S>",
    "<S> we employ a grin fiber ( ofs , bf04432 - 1 ) with its length determining the effective focal length . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the grin fiber is spliced ( fujikura fsm1000 arc master ) to a cleaved single mode fiber ( ivg , cu800 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the grin fiber is precisely cleaved ( fujikura ct100 ) under a microscope @xcite to a predefined length to within @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the length of grin fiber is adjusted such that the resulting mode waist matches that of the ffpc . </S>",
    "<S> even though the splice losses between the sm and grin fibers are low ( @xmath5 0.01db as specified by the splicer analysis ) , they result in a modification of the effective mode field diameter at the sm - grin interface , which needs to be taken into account when cleaving the grin fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the actual mode waist is confirmed by measuring the mode profile at the output of the sm - grin assembly along the axial direction . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , a laser beam is coupled into the other end of the sm fiber and the output beam from the grin fiber is measured using a knife edge translating across the beam . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the measurement with the propagation of a gaussian beam , the waist size and its position with respect to the end facet of the grin fiber is found . to position the cavity mirrors at the optimal distance from the grin fiber a piece of a mm fiber </S>",
    "<S> is spliced to it . </S>",
    "<S> this fiber serves as a spacer as well as a carrier for the cavity mirror . due to the large core size of the mm fiber </S>",
    "<S> , it does not disturb the free propagation of the mode shaped by the grin fiber . </S>",
    "<S> based on the waist position measurement , the mm fiber is cleaved at the optimal position for the desired cavity geometry . finally , the end facet of the mm fiber is laser ablated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting mode matching fiber assembly ( fa ) , shown in fig.[fig : realpic](c ) , is a concatenation of a sm , grin and mm fiber which are directly spliced together , producing a co - axial all - fiber structure . </S>",
    "<S> the final mode profile measured at the output of fa , is illustrated in fig.[fig : realpic](d ) which clearly depicts that the output beam is converging to a waist outside the assembly . </S>",
    "<S> after characterizing the mode , the end facet of the mm fiber is coated with a highly reflective dielectric coating ( 20 ppm losses at 866 nm from laseroptik gmbh ) .     and 402 @xmath1 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lengths of the respective fibers determine the waist size and waist position of mode at the output of the fa . </S>",
    "<S> d ) mode radius of the output from the fa , where @xmath6=0 is the laser ablated end facet of the mm fiber . </S>",
    "<S> waist size ( @xmath7 ) of 8.1 @xmath1 at @xmath6 = 230 @xmath1 is obtained by fitting the data with the propagation of a gaussian beam . ]    to evaluate the mode matching between the fiber and cavity modes , we set up a ffpc . </S>",
    "<S> one of the fibers is clamped on a custom - made fiber mount , including a sheer piezo actuator which can translate the fiber along its axis for fine tuning and scanning of the cavity length . </S>",
    "<S> this mount is in turn attached to a kinematic prism stage to allow angular adjustment . </S>",
    "<S> the second fiber is mounted on a motorized translation stage facilitating 3-dimensional adjustment of the fiber position . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the fiber can be translated to adjust the cavity length . to facilitate the fiber cavity alignment and the measurement of the distance between the fiber tips , two perpendicularly arranged microscopes </S>",
    "<S> are used to radially observe the fiber cavity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the cavity length can be measured to within @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> after adjusting the fiber alignment with the microscopes , laser light at @xmath9 is coupled into one of the fibers while the light transmitted through the cavity and entering into the second fiber is detected using a photo diode at the uncoated fiber end . </S>",
    "<S> the fibers are then further aligned by observing the cavity transmission , to maximize the transmission of the tem@xmath10 mode , while scanning the length of the cavity with the piezo actuator .    in order to determine the mode matching between the fiber and the cavity modes </S>",
    "<S> , we use an fa as the input of the cavity and a mm fiber , with a laser machined and high reflectivity coated end facet , as the output . </S>",
    "<S> the fa has a designed waist size of 8.1 @xmath1 at a distance of 230 @xmath1 from the end facet of the assembly and a radius of curvature ( roc ) of 700 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the mm fiber for the cavity output has a roc of 540 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> using these parameters , the expected mode matching from the numerical simulation is better than 90% for cavity lengths between 180 @xmath1 and 520 @xmath1 , with a maximum of 99.9% at 460 @xmath1 ( shown in fig.[fig : modematch ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> employing a mm fiber at the output of the cavity is beneficial as the entire cavity transmission spectrum can be observed without spatially filtering high order transverse modes of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> as described in @xcite , the mode matching of a ffpc can not be determined by simultaneously observing the cavity s reflection and transmission since the reflected light at the cavity input is mode - filtered by the sm input fiber . </S>",
    "<S> thus , utilizing the resonant dips in the reflection would greatly overestimate the cavity coupling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in this work , only the transmission spectra are used to determine the mode matching .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the cavity transmission intensities of the fundamental tem@xmath10 mode ( @xmath11 ) and of the modes of order @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) defined by @xmath14 can be used to estimate the real mode matching efficiency @xmath15 of the fiber mode to the cavity s fundamental mode . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation for the mode matching ( @xmath16 ) is valid as long as the damping for all the cavity modes is the same . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission intensity @xmath13 is not only a function of the mode - matching efficiency @xmath17 but also of the cavity finesse @xmath18 for the corresponding mode : @xmath19 where @xmath20 includes the efficiencies independent of the mode orders , as well as the detection and propagation efficiencies , and @xmath21 is the intensity of the input beam . when the values of @xmath18 are the same irrespective of the mode order , @xmath16 is satisfied in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : beta ] ) from the normalization condition @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the contribution of the higher order modes may be underestimated , leading to an overestimation of the mode matching . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , clipping losses @xcite can lead to an increased damping for the high order modes due to their larger spatial extension on the cavity mirrors .    to eliminate this effect on our measurements , we measure the finesses of all the modes visible in the transmission spectrum to confirm uniform damping of the modes . to this end , the cavity length , @xmath23 , </S>",
    "<S> is measured using a calibrated microscope and the free spectral range ( fsr ) is calculated as fsr@xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> an electro - optic modulator is used to generate sidebands on the laser to act as a frequency calibration of the transmission spectrum to evaluate the cavity linewidth @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finesse is then calculated by @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> = ( a ) 132@xmath27 m , ( b ) 426@xmath27 m , ( c ) 536 @xmath27 m while the cavity is scanned by the piezo actuator over approximately one fsr . </S>",

    "<S> an average of 20 traces is taken for each data point . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars indicate the mean standard errors . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spect ] the transmission spectra at three different cavity lengths are displayed with the insets showing details of the higher order mode peaks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fa_mm ] shows the finesse as well as the transmission intensity , @xmath11 of the fundamental mode as a function of the cavity length . </S>",
    "<S> the finesse exhibits the typical behavior of a fiber cavity with mm fiber mirrors @xcite with a plateau across most of the length range and a sharp drop at the edge of the stability limit . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath11 is stable across most of the stability region of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transmission spectra show a very different behavior with @xmath28 = 74% at a cavity length of 132@xmath1 , 69% at 536@xmath1 and a 90% at the cavity length of 426@xmath1 . at these three cavity lengths </S>",
    "<S> , we confirmed that the cavity finesse is identical within the measurement errors for all the modes visible in the spectrum , and hence , @xmath28 is a good measure for mode matching . </S>",
    "<S> the mode matching at a cavity length @xmath29 is related to the one at @xmath30 through @xmath31 hence , from a single measurement of @xmath32 at a cavity length @xmath30 , the mode matching efficiency at an arbitrary cavity length can be calculated by using only the transmission and finesse of the fundamental mode . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the measurement at a cavity length of 132 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) as reference where @xmath35 holds , and calculate the estimated mode matching efficiencies over the entire range of the cavity length by using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : beta - l ] ) and the data set in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fa_mm ] .     </S>",
    "<S> the data points are estimated mode matching efficiencies ( @xmath32 ) as a function of cavity length ( @xmath23 ) , calculated by using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : beta - l ] ) , for fa - mm configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars indicate the mean standard errors . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines are numerical simulations for the fa - mm and sm - mm configurations ]    as shown in fig.[fig : modematch ] , the mode matching efficiencies calculated in this way fit well with the numerical prediction , constituting another strong evidence that our mode - matching assembly is working as expected . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modematch ] also shows a numerical simulation where the same cavity geometry is used but the fa is replaced with a sm fiber . </S>",
    "<S> one can see the substantial advantage of our fa for cavity lengths @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting system is one where both sides of the cavity are constituted by the mode matching fiber assemblies ( fa - fa system ) . this configuration implements a bi - directional input - output system ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : modefilter]a ) . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modefilter]b shows a transmission spectrum for such a system with the input side of the cavity being the fa described above . </S>",
    "<S> the output side of the cavity is formed by another fa with roc of 630 @xmath33 and designed for a waist size of 8.4 @xmath33 at a distance of 230 @xmath33 from the end facet of assembly . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the cavity is adjusted for the optimal mode matching between the fiber and the cavity modes .        here </S>",
    "<S> we see , the intensity ratio @xmath28 of 98.6 % at a cavity length of 420 @xmath1 , which is a result of the mode filtering happening on both sides of the cavity . in other words , in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , the transmission @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath37 instead of @xmath17 , resulting in enhanced suppression of the higher order peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath28 in turn corresponds to @xmath38 on average for a single fa , which is consistent with the results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spect ] at the same cavity length .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a versatile method to optimize the mode matching between input / output optical fibers and ffpcs . using a combination of grin and mm fibers , the modes of almost any sm fiber </S>",
    "<S> can be matched to the mode of a ffpc . </S>",
    "<S> this enables the use of standard polarization maintaining fibers as well as specialty fibers such as spun fibers or photonic crystal fibers in conjunction with ffpcs . with mode matching efficiencies of about 90% </S>",
    "<S> , ffpcs can now be utilized for a wide range of applications where good coupling between the cavity an optical sm fibers is crucial .    </S>",
