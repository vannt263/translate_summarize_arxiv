    "supersymmetry is an attractive possibility beyond the standard model . because of the relations supersymmetry imposes among the dimensionless couplings , the quadratic divergences in the higgs sector are cut - off by the superpartner mass scale .",
    "the cancellations stabilize the hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is consistent with gauge coupling unification suggested by grand unified theories .",
    "also , it is interesting that one of the hallmarks of supersymmetry , a light higgs boson ( @xmath7 gev ) , is favored by global fits to precision electroweak data @xcite .    if low energy supersymmetry exists , superpartners will be copiously produced at the next generation of supercolliders .",
    "for example , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) could produce thousands of gluino pairs in a single day .",
    "each gluino would then , in a typical scenario , decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) through a cascade of charginos , neutralinos , jets and leptons .",
    "detailed information about the superpartner masses can be determined from such processes @xcite . a future linear collider ( lc )",
    "would likewise prove to be an invaluable tool in measuring the parameters of the soft - supersymmetry breaking lagrangian , as precision measurements of the superpartner spectrum , cross - sections , and branching ratios are possible @xcite .",
    "the constrained kinematics , tunable center - of - mass energy , and beam polarization allow for direct and model independent interpretations of the measurements .",
    "also , in many processes the backgrounds are quite small .    in this paper",
    "we examine the prospect of testing supersymmetry via a precise measurement of the lepton - slepton - gaugino vertex .",
    "the linear collider provides a suitably clean experimental environment . among the relations which account for the cancellations of quadratic divergences",
    ", supersymmetry relates the lepton - slepton - gaugino coupling to the usual gauge coupling .",
    "although bare ( or ) couplings enjoy the relations imposed by supersymmetry , the effective gauge and gaugino couplings are not equal because supersymmetry is broken .",
    "in particular , all non - singlet nondegenerate supermultiplets such as the quark - squark supermultiplets contribute to the splitting .",
    "even arbitrarily heavy split multiplets will contribute , although the contribution will be suppressed by the heavy mass scale .",
    "hence , measurements of the type we consider here not only provide for detailed tests of supersymmetry , but can also elucidate important features of the scale and pattern of supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "for example , the ( s)quark contribution to the splitting of the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino / gauge ( s)lepton couplings grows logarithmically with the squark mass , as @xmath8 this correction is obtained by evolving the couplings according to the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) of the effective theory @xcite below the squark mass threshold . when @xmath9 the correction to the su(2 ) ( u(1 ) ) coupling is about 2% ( 0.7% ) .",
    "this gives rise to an enhancement of the @xmath0-channel slepton or gaugino production cross - section of about 8% ( 2.8% ) .",
    "if large statistics are available and systematic errors can be controlled , we can ( assuming the mssm ) constrain the squark mass scale by this measurement .",
    "notice that a modest hierarchy between the squark and slepton masses is typical of the simplest gauge mediated models , which predict @xmath10 .    as another example",
    ", it has been proposed that the scalar masses of the first two generations might be very heavy ( e.g. 20 tev ) so that the fcnc constraints on the scalar masses are alleviated @xcite .",
    "this large hierarchy in the superpartner spectrum will be reflected in the splitting of the gaugino / gauge couplings of the third generation ( s)fermions .",
    "we restrict our attention to the measurement of the first generation lepton - slepton - gaugino coupling at an @xmath11 linear collider .",
    "much study has been undertaken to determine how accurately we can expect to measure these couplings . two relevant processes to consider are chargino production and slepton production .",
    "these processes involve the lepton - slepton - gaugino coupling by way of the @xmath0-channel exchange of a sfermion or gaugino .",
    "the measurement of the gaugino coupling via the chargino production process has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that study",
    "the authors worked under the assumption that only chargino production was available .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath12 coupling could be determined to about 20% . incorporating knowledge about the sneutrino mass allows for an improved @xmath13-@xmath14 determination of the @xmath15 coupling @xcite .",
    "a more precise determination is possible by studying slepton production . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that by measuring @xmath16 production the u(1 ) @xmath17 coupling could be determined to about @xmath18 .",
    "note that this is the same order of magnitude as the splitting due to heavy squarks ( see eq .",
    "( [ ln msq ] ) ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was estimated that a @xmath19 measurement of the u(1 ) gaugino coupling could be achieved by measuring @xmath20 production at an @xmath21 collider .",
    "we perform a full one - loop calculation of the slepton production cross - section within the mssm .",
    "since we are interested in the sensitivity to the squark mass scale , we assume the squark mass spectrum is well approximated by a single mass scale , @xmath22 , and allow for a large hierarchy between the squark and slepton masses .",
    "we include only ( s)quark loops in the calculation , because the correction is enhanced by a color factor and the number of generations .",
    "the remaining corrections are small , and if we did include them we expect our conclusions would not change .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the radiative correction calculation .",
    "we point out that , to a good approximation , the one - loop @xmath0-channel amplitudes can be rewritten in the same form as the tree - level amplitudes , with the replacement of the tree - level parameters with renormalized effective parameters .",

    "we show our numerical results .",

    "the cross - section is pretty much independent of @xmath48 once @xmath226 gev , in this case .",
    "if we vary @xmath48 from 450 to 850 gev the cross - section varies by about 2% .",
    "it is good to keep in mind that @xmath48 may be constrained in a situation such as this by measuring the left - right asymmetry of the lighter chargino production cross - section .    figs .",
    "6 illustrate that we might have to rely on independent measurements of @xmath49 in order to obtain a nice constraint on @xmath22 . for many regions in parameter space",
    "we expect @xmath49 will indeed be known fairly well .",
    "for example , it was pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite that the measurement of the chargino forward - backward asymmetry provides a strong constraint on @xmath49 if @xmath227 .",
    "also , for not too large slepton masses and @xmath228 , the measurement of the mass difference between @xmath229 and @xmath200 gives a sensitive measurement of @xmath49 .",
    "other measurements can be instrumental in pinning down @xmath49 . for example",
    ", the higgs sector constraints on @xmath49 are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which tend to give decent bounds for @xmath230 .",

    "this results in an especially large sensitivity to the final - state mass .",
    "for example , a 1% uncertainty of @xmath168 results in @xmath237 , for @xmath110  gev , and @xmath112  gev .",
    "this immediately translates into a 5.3% error in the total cross - section .",
    "although a simple statistical scale - up of the results of ref .",

    "( systematic errors might be the limiting factor here . )",
    "note , however , that the measurement of the sneutrino mass in ref",
    ".  @xcite was obtained by studying a small fraction of the total sneutrino decay modes .",
    "the mode they studied , @xmath238 @xmath239 , amounts to only about 4% of the total sneutrino decays .",
    "using other modes , such as @xmath240 , might reduce the mass error even further . because the @xmath200 production cross - section is significantly larger than the other slepton cross - sections , isolating the various sneutrino signatures is less affected by susy backgrounds such as @xmath241 @xmath242 . in this discussion",
    "we assume the errors are dominantly statistical .",
    "now we show the constraint on the squark mass @xmath81 after taking into account the uncertainty of the masses @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "for this purpose , we define a @xmath166 function as @xmath245 here we consider the @xmath129 case , in which the @xmath246 and @xmath247 mass dependencies are negligible .",
    "we also assume that @xmath49 is well measured . in fig .",
    "7 we plot @xmath248 against @xmath81 , where @xmath249 is a minimum of @xmath166 with respect to variations in @xmath87 and @xmath197 . by construction , the region of @xmath22 where @xmath250 corresponds to @xmath251-@xmath209 error of the squark mass when",
    "the chargino and sneutrino mass uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "the sneutrino mass uncertainty reduces the sensitivity of the production cross - section to @xmath81 considerably , because the effect of increasing @xmath81 can be compensated for by a small increase in @xmath197 .",
    "on the other hand , we do not find any significant effect due to non - zero @xmath244 .    from fig .",
    "7 we see that in this case , even with the sneutrino mass uncertainty , we can reasonably constrain the squark mass scale . for example , at the 1-@xmath209 level with @xmath163 tev , we constrain @xmath22 to @xmath252 tev , using the naive scale up ( from 20 fb@xmath198 to 100 fb@xmath198 ) of the statistical errors of ref .  @xcite .",

    "7 illustrates the large dependence on the mass uncertainties .",
    "this sensitivity is greatly reduced in the case of chargino production . as we mentioned previously",
    ", the @xmath0-channel amplitude is very similar to that of sneutrino production ; only its final and intermediate states are exchanged .",
    "the external chargino wave - function renormalization induces the same @xmath73 correction to the @xmath256-@xmath200-@xmath257 coupling .",
    "also , the chargino production cross - section is generally large ; for the set of parameters considered , it is near 1 pb for a left - handed electron beam . because the chargino cross - section is only proportional to a single power of @xmath258 , the uncertainty in the cross - section due to the final state mass is effectively reduced by a factor of 3 .",
    "notice @xmath87 can be measured through the electron energy distribution from the @xmath200 production and decay . also , the chargino production cross - section rises quickly near threshold , which allows for a determination of its mass by a threshold scan .    in figs .  6 and 7",
    ", we assumed that the decays into the lightest chargino @xmath259 were detectable as @xmath200 production signal without background .",
    "this may not be true , depending on the decay mode of the chargino .",
    "for example , if both of the charginos decay into @xmath260 , it gives an @xmath261 signal event with missing energy .",
    "pair production of @xmath262 could give the same @xmath261 signal with similar kinematics .",
    "by su(2 ) invariance @xmath229 and @xmath200 are very close in mass , so it is natural to think that this background is necessarily problematic .",
    "additionally , at point 3 ref .",
    "@xcite estimates that the @xmath229 mass uncertainty is larger than that of @xmath200 ; this corresponds to a large uncertainty in the expected @xmath229 production cross - section .",
    "fortunately , in this case , the cross - section of @xmath229 and its branching ratio into @xmath263 are small , and they are constrained by other measurements , so they give a negligible background to the @xmath264 signal .",
    "we also assumed constant @xmath265 throughout figs .",

    "we did not include the expected luminosity and acceptance errors .",
    "needless to say , it is extremely important to achieve a low luminosity error , since we are dealing with a potentially sub - percent measurement .",
    "the effect of the luminosity error can be directly seen in fig .",
    "6 . in the chargino study of ref .",
    "@xcite , the systematic error of acceptance is claimed to be significant in the two jet + lepton final state .",

    "production cross - sections such as @xmath274 and @xmath275 involve the @xmath0-channel exchange of gauginos or sleptons , so they depend on gaugino couplings .",

    "the sensitivity ranges from about 1% to 10% , depending on the assumptions .    in this paper",

    "the constraint on the squark mass we have realized here could be unique in the sense that this information may not be available at the lhc .",
