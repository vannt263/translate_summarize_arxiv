    "`` are you ready to settle down ? ''",
    "`` are you in love or forcing it ? ''",
    "these are the titles of compatibility quizzes found in cosmopolitan magazine @xcite .",
    "the `` love calculator '' featured in glamour magazine @xcite claims to determine whether  you and he add up \" or are `` destined for a long division ? '' these and most other compatibility quizzes we have seen in popular culture do not appear to have a rigorous scientific basis and are often easy to cheat to control the test results .",
    "we have created a compatibility test based on sound mathematical principles and john nash s notion of equilibrium strategy .",
    "the test must be taken separately by both partners , making it difficult for either partner alone to control the outcome .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we introduce nash s notion of equilibrium strategy and investigate an example from popular culture .",
    "our test comprises  3 . in  4 , we show how to evaluate the test , and we also show how the test can be modified to provide more accurate results or to evaluate non - romantic relationships , for example in professional or political settings . in the last section of this note , we explore the long - term dynamics of give and take in a relationship using a variation of the iterated prisoner s dilemma ( ipd ) and dyson s and press s 2012 discovery of  zero determinant payoff strategies for the ipd @xcite .",
    "incorporating rigorous pure mathematics into real - world situations can be a subtle problem . to illustrate this",
    "let s consider an example from popular culture .",
    "our quiz is based on the notion of equilibrium strategy and the nobel - prize winning theorem of john nash @xcite . to familiarize the uninitiated with this notion",
    ", we recall a scene from the film , `` a beautiful mind , '' based on nash s life and work , which attempts to depict nash s thereom . the scene is set in a bar and begins with nash s character and his buddies watching a group of attractive women enter the bar .",
    "one woman is exceptionally beautiful , and the men begin discussing their best strategies to court her . after a moment of reflection",
    "nash s character realizes that the `` best '' tactic is for the men to each approach one of the averagely attractive women , rather than trying to court the exceptionally beautiful woman .",
    "one sees this depicted in the film as each man leaves with one of the averagely beautiful women , and the exceptionally beautiful woman is alone .",
    "is this really an equilibrium strategy according to nash s theorem ?",
    "let s recall the definitions and statement of nash s celebrated theorem .",
    "an @xmath0-person non - cooperative game is based on the absence of coalitions or communication between players .",
    "the @xmath1 player has a set of @xmath2 pure strategies , each of which can be identified with one of the standard unit vectors in @xmath3 .",
    "the set of mixed strategies corresponds to a probability distribution over pure strategies and can be identified with the convex subset @xmath4 the total strategy space over all players can then be identified with @xmath5 each player has an associated payoff function @xmath6 .",
    "the payoff functions are linear in the strategy of the respective player .",
    "that is , if all other players strategies are fixed , the payoff function is a linear function from @xmath7 .",
    "typically , the payoff function is assumed to be continuous on @xmath8 . in @xcite",
    ", nash proved that for every such game , there exists at least one `` equilibrium strategy , '' which in the following sense is the `` best '' strategy for all players . for @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath10 denote the payoff for the strategy in which the @xmath1 player s strategy according to @xmath11 is replaced by @xmath12 .",
    "an equilibrium strategy @xmath11 satisfies @xmath13 in other words , if a single player changes his strategy , he can not increase his payoff .    for any @xmath0-person non - cooperative game such that the payoff functions are linear in the strategy of each player and are continuous functions on the total strategy space there",
    "exists at least one equilibrium strategy .    to analyze the scene from the film , for simplicity ,",
    "let s assume there are 2 men , denoted by man 1 and man 2 , and 3 women , one denoted by `` g '' ( for gorgeous ) and two denoted by `` p '' ( for pretty ) .",
    "each man has two pure strategies : `` g '' which corresponds to courting the gorgeous woman , and `` p '' which corresponds to courting one of the pretty women .",
    "first , consider the following payoff matrix :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the iterated prisoner s dilemma the `` game '' is repeated .",
    "we can use the dynamics of the iterated prisoner s dilemma to study the dynamics of give and take in a relationship , which we call the `` iterated dating dilemma ( idd ) . ''",
    "of course , we are simplifying things a bit here , for example by assuming the payoffs are symmetric and remain constant over time .",
    "nonetheless we have found that analyzing the long - term dynamics of give and take in a relationship using the iterated prisoner s dilemma leads to interesting results .    at each round of the game",
    "we assume that each person remembers what happened in the previous round .",
    "press and dyson proved that it does nt matter whether one person can remember more than the other , which game - theoretically means that a long - memory player has no advantage over a memory - one player ( someone who can only remember the previous date ) @xcite .",
    "this in itself is rather interesting and a bit of a relief !",
    "it means that to ensure our best possible payoff over time , we just need to remember what happened last time .",
    "let s call the two people in the couple pat and gene .",
    "at each iteration of the idd there are four possibilities for the previous outcome : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "pat s strategy is @xmath18 which corresponds to her probability of cooperating ( giving ) under each of the previous outcomes .",
    "gene s strategy is @xmath19 ( c.f . fig",
    ". 1 @xcite ) which corresponds to his probability of cooperating under each of the previous outcomes .",
    "hauert and schuster @xcite showed that these probabilities can be used to determine the expected outcome for each player .",
    "the unexpected fact proven in @xcite is that there exist strategies for pat and gene such that pat can control gene s expected payoff , and/or gene can control pat s expected payoff .",
    "these are known as _ zero - determinant _ ( zd ) strategies , because these strategies are precisely those such that the determinant of a certain matrix vanishes ; we refer interested readers to the proofs and calculations in @xcite and focus here on the implications of those results .",
    "press and dyson showed that pat ( or gene ) can force any particular score for gene ( or pat ) regardless of what the other person does .",
    "they also showed that it is _ not _ possible for pat or gene to unilaterally set his or her own score .",
    "_ _ _ _    although it is impossible for pat to control her own expected payoff , she can control gene s , and vice - versa .",
    "this would seem to indicate that whereas one can influence his or her partner s happiness by his or her choice of behaviors , one can not unilaterally control one s own happiness in a relationship . moreover , since a longer memory player has no advantage over a memory - one player , it suffices to remember what happened `` last time '' to make one s best decision for `` next time .
