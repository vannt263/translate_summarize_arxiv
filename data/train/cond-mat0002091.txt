    "the list of materials in which carriers are strongly interacting with each other and scatter by random impurities is quite long .",
    "it comprises _ inter alia _ high temperature superconducting oxides @xcite and various heavy fermion alloys @xcite .",
    "two models are usually used to study such system .",
    "it is either hubbard or anderson model suitably extended to allow for the description of real materials . here",
    "the single band hubbard model has been used , as it is the simplest model of correlated system .",
    "the disorder is introduced into the model by allowing for fluctuations of the local on - site energies @xmath0 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the interplay of disorder and correlations in the hubbard model .",
    "i shall present analytical and numerical calculations indicating that correlations induce additional disorder in the system .",
    "_ mutatis mutandis _ disorder in the system affects the parameters of the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition . in the recent studies of weakly interacting disordered systems",
    "it has been found that due to disorder the interactions scale to strong coupling limit @xcite . here to treat many particle aspect of the problem we use the slave boson technique , which is known to be qualitatively valid for all strength of interaction . in particular",
    "this method reproduces the results of the gutzwiller approximation at the saddle - point level @xcite .",
    "we start here with random version of the hubbard model    @xmath1    the meaning of symbols is standard .",
    "the first term describes the hopping of carriers through the crystal specified by lattice sites @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the fluctuating site energy - it introduces disorder into the model .",
    "@xmath5 is the repulsion between two opposite spin electrons occupying the same site . in the slave boson technique@xcite",
    "one introduces 4 auxiliary boson fields : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 project onto the empty , singly occupied by @xmath12 and doubly occupied site @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is in this enlarged hilbert space written as @xmath13 where @xmath14",
    ". equation ( 2 ) is strictly equivalent to ( 1 ) , when the constraints @xmath15 are fulfilled . in disordered system and at @xmath16 = 0 k",
    ", the mean field approach to slave bosons can be formulated by suitably generalizing the clean limit .",
    "one introduces the constraints into hamiltonian with help of langrange multipliers @xmath17 and @xmath18 and replaces boson operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 by classical , site dependent , amplitudes @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "these amplitudes are calculated from the , configuration dependent , ground state energy @xmath25 by minimizing @xmath26 with respect to all seven parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 , @xmath18 . as a result one",
    "gets three constraints : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and four additional equations which read @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the important next step is connected with calculation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the presence of disorder . in principle",
    "these quantities do depend on the particular distribution of all impurities ( i.e. distribution of site energies @xmath4 ) .",
    "we shall calculate them from the corresponding green s function .",
    "we use a version@xcite of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to calculate ( averaged and conditionally averaged ) green s functions . to this end",
    "we rewrite the mean field hamiltonian in the form @xmath34 note , that hamiltonian ( 5 ) contains not only the site dependent parameters @xmath35 but due to correlations there appear also @xmath36 which are the additional source of , diagonal and spin dependent , disorder . besides that",
    ", the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 which vary from site to site make effective hopings @xmath39 random quantities .",
    "this off - diagonal ( in wannier space ) disorder is particularly important .",
    "fortunately multiplicative dependence of effective hopping on the kind of atoms at sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 is easy to handle within cpa .",
    "the procedure is standard@xcite and one gets the following equation for the density of states in paramagnetic phase @xmath40}{1-\\left [ \\sigma ( \\varepsilon   ^{+})-(\\varepsilon -\\varepsilon _ { i}+\\mu -\\lambda _ { i}^{(2)})/\\xi _ { i}^{2 } \\right ] \\,f[\\sigma ( \\varepsilon ) ] } } \\rangle _",

    "they can be calculated from the knowledge of the cpa green s functions in the following way .",
    "we assume that site @xmath2 is described by actual parameters _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath4 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 , while all other sites in the system are replaced by effective ones described by the coherent potential @xmath47 and the green s functions @xmath48 .",
    "then it is easy to find that _ e.g_. @xmath49 and @xcite @xmath50 here @xmath51 , and by definition @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53  this closes the system of equations to be solved in a self - consistent manner . in the next section we show numerical calculations of the effect of correlations on the density of states in disordered alloy .",
    "for the purpose of numerical illustration of the general approach sketched in previous section we calculate here the density of states ( dos ) of perfect interacting , random noninteracting and random interacting systems . for the purpose of numerical analysis we shall assume @xmath54 limit and _ bcc _ crystal structure , which leads to the following canonical tight - binding spectrum of noninteracting carriers in clean material      using t=0.0625@xmath56 leads to the noninteracting system bandwidth @xmath57 . in the following all energies and frequencies",
    "are expressed in @xmath56 . the density of states corresponding to this spectrum is well known .",
    "it possesses van hove singularity in the middle of the band , which extends from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath60 of a clean but interacting system in the @xmath54 limit is replaced by @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding density of states is thus of the same form but placed in the energy window @xmath62 $ ] and scaled by the factor @xmath63 .",
    "note that in this @xmath54 limit the upper hubbard band is pushed to infinity and not visible .",
    "the changes of the spectrum due to correlations in disordered @xmath64 alloy are illustrated in figure ( 1 ) where we show the averaged @xmath65 and conditionally averaged densities of states @xmath66 and @xmath67  ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) without ( fig .",
    "2a ) and with ( fig .",
    "2b ) electron correlations . the carrier concentration @xmath70 .",
    "noninteracting alloy dos is symmetric .",
    "we observe strong asymmetry , the opening of the real gap in the spectrum of interacting carriers and the appreciable increase of the density of states at the fermi level ( taken as e=0 in the figure ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that interplay of disorder and correlations leads to strong renormalisation of the electron spectrum .",
    "let us stress that all other properties of such systems will also be strongly affected by interaction induced disorder .",
    "the calculations of _ dc _ and _ ac _ transport properties are in progress ."
