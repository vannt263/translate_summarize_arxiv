    "it is sometimes argued that lightcone fluctuations are incompatible with lorentz invariance .",
    "the most dramatic illustration of this arises when a time advance occurs , that is , when a pulse propagates outside of the classical lightcone . in a lorentz invariant theory",
    ", there will exist a frame of reference in which the causal order of emission and detection is inverted , so the pulse is seen to be detected before it was emitted .",
    "thus the lightcone fluctuation phenomenon , if it is to exist at all , seems to be incompatible with strict lorentz invariance .    our view of the situation is the following : lightcone fluctuations respect lorentz symmetry on the average , but not in individual measurements .",
    "the symmetry on the average insures that the mean lightcone be that of classical minkowski spacetime .",
    "the average metric is that of minkowski spacetime provided that @xmath85 however , a particular pulse effectively measures a spacetime geometry which is not minkowskian and not lorentz invariant .",
    "a simple model may help to illustrate this point .",

    "( the fact that the @xmath87 schwarzschild spacetime has a naked singularity at @xmath88 need not concern us . for the purpose of this model , we can confine our discussion to a region where @xmath89 ) suppose that this ensemble has @xmath90 , but @xmath91 .",
    "it is well known that light propagation in a @xmath92 schwarzschild spacetime can exhibit a time delay relative to what would be expected in flat spacetime .",
    "this is the basis for the time delay tests of general relativity using radar signals sent near the limb of the sun . in the present model , however , the time difference is equally likely to be a time advance rather than a time delay .",
    "a measurement of the time difference amounts to a measurement of @xmath86 .",
    "this model is lorentz invariant on the average because @xmath93 and the average spacetime is minkowskian .",
    "however , a specific measurement selects a particular member of the ensemble , which is generally not lorentz invariant .",
    "in addition to the fact that the mean metric is minkowskian , there is another sense in which lightcone fluctuations due to compactification exhibit average lorentz invariance .",
    "note that @xmath94 , and hence @xmath0 , depends on the riemann tensor correlation function @xmath95 , which is invariant under lorentz boosts along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "thus if we were to repeat the above calculations of @xmath94 in a second frame moving with respect to the first , the result will be the same . in both cases",
    "one is assuming that the detector is at rest relative to the source .",
    "this is a reflection of the lorentz invariance of the spectrum of fluctuations , which is exhibited by the compactified flat spacetimes studied in this paper , but not by the schwarzschild spacetime with a fluctuating mass .",
    "in this section , we will specialize to the case of one extra compactified dimension , so @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this corresponds to the original kaluza - klein model  @xcite .",
