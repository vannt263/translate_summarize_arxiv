    "sequence alignment deals with the problem of identifying similarities between two different sequences of objects , represented by `` letters '' from some `` alphabet '' .",

    "the variable @xmath7 is 1 if the letters at the positions @xmath2 and @xmath3 match each other , and 0 if they do not . if one ignores the correlations between different @xmath7 , and takes them from the bimodal distribution @xmath8 , one gets the bernoulli matching ( bm ) model of sequence alignment @xcite . to get a model closest to the original lcs problem",
    ", one has to put @xmath9 . in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long sequences",
    "this problem has been studied in some detail . with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , sepplinen derived rigorously the law of large numbers limit .",
    "asymptotically the quantity @xmath12 is a random variable converging a.s . to a function of @xmath13 which he computed",
    "explicitly @xcite . using an exact mapping to a directed polymer problem , complemented with scaling arguments",
    ", it was shown more recently @xcite that asymptotically the quantity @xmath14 is a random variable of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 are known scale factors and @xmath17 is a random variable drawn from the tracy - widom distribution of the largest eigenvalue of gue random matrices @xcite . in subsequent work @xcite some related quantities were obtained for the thermodynamic limit using a mapping to a 5-vertex model and applying the bethe ansatz .    in this paper",
    "we compute analytically the exact distribution of @xmath14 for _ finite _ sequences by a mapping of the bm problem to a stochastic exclusion process .",
    "the mapping of the sequence alignment problem onto the asymmetric exclusion process has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the hopping dynamic considered in @xcite is the asymmetric exclusion process with sublattice - parallel update which admits a transfer - matrix formulation and diagonalization of the matrix for finite @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "since our interest lies in an analytical solution for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we choose another mapping onto a discrete - time fragmentation process which is equivalent to a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with backward sequential update @xcite .",
    "this allows us to use earlier results obtained directly from bethe ansatz @xcite for this stochastic lattice gas model .",
    "specifically , we will express the probability that the length of the lcs is at most @xmath18 by the probability that the number of jumps of a selected particle in the exclusion process up to time @xmath3 is at least @xmath19 .",
    "we also outline how ( [ lcsbminf ] ) arises in the thermodynamic limit from the result for finite sequences .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1](a )",
    "we illustrate the lcs problem in matrix form for two sequences of lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 from an alphabet of the four letters @xmath22 used in dna sequencing .",
    "the vertical sequence is read from bottom to top , the horizontal sequence is read from left to right .",
    "whenever two letters match there is a bold face 1 in the matrix .",
    "the recursion ( [ recursion ] ) ( its solution is shown in small blue numbers in the matrix ) generates a terrace - like structure ( red lines ) where the number of terraces is @xmath14 .",
    "the boundary condition of the recursion amounts to assigning value 0 to the boxes containing the letters of the two sequences and also to the empty lower left starting corner . solving the recursion ( [ recursion ] ) , one can note that blue numbers in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) appear with different statistical weights .",
    "indeed , numbers at left corners of terraces appear when @xmath23 and have weight @xmath24 .",
    "all the rest of numbers at edges of terraces do not depend on @xmath7 and have therefore weight @xmath25 .",
    "all remaining numbers appear when @xmath26 having weight @xmath27 .",
    "it is useful to view the grid that defines the matching matrix as a square lattice with @xmath28 bulk sites , embedded in the rectangle of size @xmath29 .",
    "each square ( defining the dual square lattice ) is labelled @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 . due to the terraces ,",
    "each site can take one of five different states .",
    "it may be ( i ) traversed horizontally or vertically by a ( red ) terrace line ( ii ) represent a left or right corner of a terrace , or ( iii ) be empty .",

    "[ fig1](b ) . for reasons that become apparent below",
    "we define this mapping slightly differently from @xcite by interchanging the colour of all vertical lines .",
    "the resulting pattern of intersecting black and red lines then becomes isomorphic to the pattern of in- and outging arrows in the five - vertex model with vertex weights given by the weights of the bm model .",
    "one simply identifies black ( red ) horizontal lines with right - pointing ( left - pointing ) arrows and black ( red ) vertical lines with up - pointing ( down - pointing ) arrows as shown in fig .",

    "( a ) mapping of line intersection to vertices of the six - vertex model which is effectively a five - vertex model since one of the vertex weights is zero .",
    "( b ) a way to avoid line intersections in the five vertex model : if a horizontal line has a left adjacent vertical line below and a right vertical line above , it is replaced by the diagonal shortcut.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a similar terrace - like structure appears in the anisotropic 3d directed percolation model ( adp ) solved by rajesh and dhar @xcite .",
    "a difference is that levels lines in the adp can overlap .",
    "the overlapping lines can be separated by successive shifts of terraces , then one gets the five - vertex model with the same vertex weights as described above .",
    "however , the shifts destroy the domain - wall boundary conditions which are essential for thw exaxt solution of the bm model .",
    "then , the analogy between the adp and the bm models can be used only in the thermodynamic limit as it was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it is useful to consider a further mapping of this 5-vertex model onto a discrete - time stochastic process , considering the vertical direction as time and horizontal one as discrete space . to this end",

    "each step of a particle by one lattice unit in positive direction has probability @xmath35 , provided the neighbouring target site is empty . if the target site is occupied , the jump attempt is rejected with probability 1 .",
    "no backward moves are allowed , making the exclusion process totally asymmetric .",
    "the horizontal boundary condition of the original sequence matching problem maps into an initial condition where at time @xmath46 particles occupy consecutive dual lattice points @xmath47 . since the motion of a particle is not influenced by any particles to its left",
    ", we may extend the lattice to minus infinity .",
    "the vertical boundary condition is equivalent to extending the lattice to plus infinity , such that at time @xmath46 all sites @xmath48 are vacant .",
    "thus one has a tasep on an initially half - filled infinite lattice with step initial state . however , only the first @xmath2 particles contribute to the statistical properties of the bm model .    in the exclusion picture",
    "the terrace height has a simple probabilistic interpretation .",
    "it counts the number of world lines that intersects with a diagonal in the square lattice starting from the point @xmath49 ( the left dotted line in fig .",
    "hence , at any given time step , the terrace increases at each site from right to left by one unit , unless a world line has been crossed when going from right to left .",
    "therefore the number @xmath50 of trajectories ending at time @xmath51 and the length @xmath52 of the lcs of the bm model on the rectangle @xmath29 are related by @xmath53 .",
    "our aim is the evaluation of the probability distribution @xmath54 $ ] of the bernoulli model . having the tasep interpretation of the original model , we need to evaluate an appropriate sum over end points of trajectories of particles . to do this , we select the first trajectory ( counted from the right ) which does not end at time @xmath3 in the target range of the dual lattice given by the top row @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( the green line in fig.4 ) .",
    "an important observation is that the sum of weights of all trajectories ending at times @xmath57 ( all lines to the left of the green line ) is 1 for the conservation of probabilities in the tasep .",
    "then , the distribution @xmath58 is the sum over the probabilities of all trajectories with end points right of the green line and over end points of the green line itself .",
    "hence of all @xmath2 particles only the rightmost @xmath59 particles are relevant for the computation of @xmath58 .",
    "the initial positions of these particles are @xmath60 .    following the relation between terrace height @xmath18 and particle trajectories as discussed above",
    ", we may consider the final positions @xmath61 at the moment of time @xmath3 . by the construction",
    ", we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we first consider @xmath64 . in this case",
    "no particle has reached site @xmath65 . in particular",
    ", this implies that the first particle ( initially at site @xmath66 ) has not reached site @xmath65 .",
    "the complementary probability for this event is the probability @xmath67 that the first particle has jumped at least @xmath65 times up to time @xmath3 . hence @xmath68    now consider @xmath69",
    ". then @xmath58 is the joint probability that after @xmath3 time steps all rightmost @xmath19 particles ( located initially on @xmath70 ) have reached sites @xmath71 and the next particle ( located initially on @xmath72 ) has not reached site @xmath65 .",
    "this is equivalent to the joint probability that the particle originally at @xmath73 has jumped at least @xmath74 times and the particle originally at @xmath72 has jumped not more than @xmath74 times . by construction of the process",
    "this joint probability may be expressed as the statistical weight of all paths where the particle initially at @xmath73 jumps at least @xmath74 times minus the statistical weight of all paths where the particle initially at @xmath72 jumps at least @xmath75 times .",
    "we have come to a known problem of the tasep statistics @xcite .",
    "consider an infinite chain , the left half of which is initially occupied by particles while the right half is empty .",
    "the problem is to find the probability @xmath76 that the @xmath77th particle ( counted from the right ) of the infinite cluster hops at least @xmath78 times up to time @xmath79 . with this quantity ,",
    "we obtain for the partition function the expression @xmath80 for every @xmath69 . for @xmath64 , eq.([partfunction ] ) reduces to ( [ partfunction1 ] ) .",
    "we remark that eq.([partfunction1 ] ) may be viewed as incorporated in eq.([partfunction ] ) in agreement with the notion that the transition probability in an exclusion process with no particles ( second argument of @xmath81 for @xmath82 ) is equal to 1 ( this is the trivial transition from the empty lattice to the empty lattice ) .",
    "to derive eq.([partfunction ] ) more formally , let @xmath83 be the probability that @xmath84 particles located initially at @xmath85 will be at @xmath61 at time @xmath79 .",
