    "multiquark states were studied even before the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the development of qcd accelerated multiquark studies because it is natural in qcd that there should be multiquark states , including glueballs and quark - gluon hybrids .",
    "after more than 40 years of quark model study , the idea about baryon and meson is about to go beyond the naive picture : baryon @xmath11 and meson @xmath12 .",
    "the proton spin puzzle could be explained by introducing the @xmath13 component in the quark model @xcite . in order to understand the baryon spectroscopy better ,",
    "the five - quark component of proton was proposed @xcite .",
    "the baryon resonance is certainly coupled to the meson - baryon scattering state and should be studied by coupling the @xmath11 with @xmath11-@xmath12 scattering channel in a quark model approach .",
    "although the strange pentaquark states claimed by experimental groups few years ago might be questionable ( leps collaboration insists on the existence of pentaquark @xmath14  @xcite ) and the multi - quark states might be hard to be identified , the multi - quark study is indispensable for understanding the low energy quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , because the multi - quark states can provide information unavailable for @xmath12 meson and @xmath11 baryon , especially the property of hidden color structure .    in the past decade , many near - threshold charmonium - like states have been observed at besiii , belle , babar , and lhcb , triggering lots of studies on the molecule - like hadrons containing heavy quark . in the heavy quark sector ,",
    "the large masses of the heavy baryons reduce the kinetic of the system , which makes it easier to form bound states .",
    "so the heavy quarks play an important role to stabilize the multiquark systems .",
    "there were many theoretical studies of hidden - charm pentaquarks  @xcite , especially the prediction of narrow @xmath15 and @xmath16 resonances with hidden charm above 4 gev by using the coupled - channel unitary approach  @xcite , and the systematical investigation of possible hidden - charm molecular baryons with components of an anti - charmed meson and a charmed baryon within the one boson exchange model  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the lhcb collaboration observed two pentaquark - charmonium states in the @xmath17 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "one is @xmath0 with a mass of @xmath19 mev and a width of @xmath20 mev , and another one is @xmath1 with a mass of @xmath21 mev and a width of @xmath22 mev .",
    "the preferred @xmath23 assignments are of opposite parity , with one state having spin @xmath24 and the other @xmath25 .",
    "then , a lot of theoretical work have been done to explain these two states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they interpreted these two hidden - charm states as the loosely bound @xmath26 and @xmath27 molecular states by using the boson exchange interaction model , and gave the spin parity @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . while in ref .",
    "@xcite , a bethe - salpeter equation approach was used to studied the @xmath30 and @xmath31 interactions , and then @xmath0 and @xmath1 were identified as @xmath30 and @xmath31 molecular states with the spin parity @xmath28 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "a qcd sum rule investigation was performed , by which the @xmath0 was suggested as a @xmath31 hidden - charm pentaquark with @xmath28 and the @xmath1 was proposed as a mixed hidden - charm pentaquark of @xmath33 and @xmath31 with @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "also a coupled - channel calculation was performed to analyze the @xmath18 reaction and gave support to a @xmath28 assignment to the @xmath1 and to its nature as a molecular state mostly made of @xmath31 and @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "thus , different models may give different descriptions for the resonance structures .",
    "clearly the quark level study of these two pentaquark - charmonium states is interesting and necessary .",
    "it is well known that the forces between nucleons ( hadronic clusters of quarks ) are qualitative similar to the forces between atoms ( molecular force ) .",
    "this molecular model of nuclear forces , quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm )  @xcite , has been developed and extensively studied . in this model ,",
    "quarks confined in one nucleon are allowed to delocalize to a nearby baryon and the confinement interaction between quarks in different baryon orbits is modified to include a color screening factor .",
    "the latter is a model description of the hidden color channel coupling effect  @xcite .",
    "the delocalization parameter is determined by the dynamics of the interacting quark system , thus allows the quark system to choose the most favorable configuration through its own dynamics in a larger hilbert space .",
    "the model gives a good description of @xmath36 and @xmath37 interactions and the properties of deuteron  @xcite .",
    "it is also employed to calculated the baryon - baryon scattering phase shifts in the framework of the resonating group method ( rgm ) , and the dibaryon candidates are also studied with this model  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the interactions of possible hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks with components of an anti - charmed meson and a charmed baryon in qdcsm , and the channel - coupling effect are considered .",
    "our purpose is to understand the interaction properties of an anti - charmed meson and a charmed baryon and to see whether there are any hidden - charm pentaquark bound states or resonances .",
    "extension of the study to the bottom case is also interesting , so we also investigate hidden - bottom pentaquark systems in the present work .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we present a brief introduction of the quark model used in section ii .",
    "section iii devotes to the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the summary is shown in the last section .",
    "the detail of qdcsm used in the present work can be found in the references  @xcite . here , we just present the salient features of the model .",
    "the model hamiltonian is :      where @xmath39 is quark tensor operator ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are standard yukawa functions  @xcite ; @xmath42 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass ; @xmath43 is the chiral coupling constant ; determined as usual from the @xmath44-nucleon coupling constant ; @xmath45 is the quark - gluon coupling constant . in order to cover the wide energy range from light to heavy quarks",
    "one introduces an effective scale - dependent quark - gluon coupling @xmath46@xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the reduced mass of two interacting quarks .",
    "all other symbols have their usual meanings . here",
    ", a phenomenological color screening confinement potential is used , and @xmath49 is the color screening parameter . for the light - flavor quark system ,",
    "it is determined by fitting the deuteron properties , @xmath36 scattering phase shifts , @xmath50 and @xmath51 scattering phase shifts , respectively , with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , satisfying the relation , @xmath55 .",
    "when extending to the heavy quark case , there is no experimental data available , so we take it as a adjustable parameter . in the present work ,",
    "we take @xmath56 and @xmath57 is obtained by the relation @xmath58 .",
    "all other parameters are also taken from our previous work  @xcite , except for the charm and bottom quark masses @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which are fixed by a fitting to the masses of the charmed and bottom baryons and mesons .",
    "the values of those parameters are listed in table [ parameters ] .",
    "the calculated masses of the charmed and bottom baryons and mesons are shown in table [ baryons ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ratio_b ]    at the same time , we also do a channel - coupling calculation and a bound state is obtained .",
    "the binding energy is also shown in table [ bound_c ] under the head @xmath61 , and the mass of the bound state is shown in table [ ratio_c ] . in table",
    "[ ratio_c ] , we also illustrate the ratios of all channels coupled , from which we can judge the main state of a hidden - charm molecular pentaquark . it is obvious in table [ ratio_c ] that the main state of the @xmath9 system is @xmath8 , with the ratio @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the mass of this @xmath9 system is @xmath10 ( mev ) . besides , the ratio of @xmath63 is very small , only @xmath64 , which means the coupling effect of @xmath63 is ignorable , although it is through the central force .",
    "this result is similar with the conclusion of ref.@xcite , in which they obtained a @xmath65 @xmath8 bound state in the chiral quark model with the energy of about @xmath66 ( mev ) , and the effect of @xmath67 channel is also negligible . finally ,",
    "because the @xmath8 can be coupled to @xmath68 and @xmath17 , and the channel coupling will shift the energy of the state , a further work is needed to check whether the state @xmath8 can survive as a resonance state in the @xmath68 and @xmath17 scattering process .    for the @xmath6 system",
    ", the single channel calculation shows that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are all bound .",
    "a bound state is also obtained with the energy of @xmath69 ( mev ) by the channel - coupling calculation . from table",
    "[ ratio_c ] , we can see that the ratios of all channels are from about @xmath70 to @xmath71 , which means the channel - coupling effect can not be ignored here .",
    "additionally , the main state of the @xmath6 system is @xmath4 , with the ratio @xmath72 .",
    "the mass of this state is close to the observed @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is shown that in our quark model calculation the @xmath0 is a mixed structure of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 with quantum numbers @xmath6 , and the main channel is @xmath4 .",
    "however , this state can be coupled to @xmath17 , so more work should be done to check wether there is a resonance state in the @xmath17 scattering process .    for the @xmath7 system ,",
    "it includes only one channel @xmath5 , with the mass of @xmath73 ( mev ) , which is a litter higher than that of @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is still a candidate of @xmath1 , because the @xmath17 decay mode of @xmath1 can be naturally interpreted as the @xmath5 of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath74wave @xmath5 decay to @xmath75wave @xmath68 and @xmath17 only through the tensor interaction , so the decaying width is generally small , which can be used to explain why the width of @xmath1 is much narrower than that of @xmath0 .    for all @xmath76 systems ,",
    "we find there is no any bound state .",
    "this is reasonable , because attraction for the @xmath77 channel @xmath3 is too small to make it bound , so as the channel @xmath5 . for other channels ,",
    "the interactions are all repulsive as mentioned above , which lead to no bound states here .    in the previous discussion , the hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks were investigated .",
    "we also extend the study to the hidden - bottom pentaquarks because of the heavy flavor symmetry . here",
    "we take the value of @xmath78 .",
    "the numerical results are listed in table [ bound_b ] and table [ ratio_b ] .",
    "the results are similar to the hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks . for the @xmath9 system",
    ", there exits a bound state , the mass of which is @xmath79 mev , and the main state of this system is @xmath80 . for the @xmath6 system ,",
    "there is also a bound state of @xmath81 mev , with a mixed structure of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and the main channel is @xmath84 . for the @xmath7 system",
    ", a bound state @xmath85 is obtained , with the mass of @xmath86 mev .",
    "in summary , the two newly observed resonant states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are investigated by solving the rgm equation in the framework of qdcsm .",
    "our results show that @xmath0 is a mixed structure of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 with quantum numbers @xmath6 , and the main channel is @xmath4 ; @xmath1 can be interpreted as the @xmath5 state of @xmath7 . besides",
    ", we also obtain another bound state with quantum numbers of @xmath9 and a mass of @xmath10 ( mev ) , and the main state of this system is @xmath8 .",
    "however , all these states can be coupled to open channels , and the channel coupling will shift the energy of the state .",
    "therefore , a further work is needed to check whether these states can survive as a resonance state in the corresponding open channels scattering process . moreover , in the present work the parity quantum numbers of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are negative . although the present data of lhcb flavor the opposite parities , they also mentioned in their paper that the same parities were not excluded  @xcite .    besides the above calculation , we also extend our formalism to the hidden - bottom pentaquarks .",
    "the results are similar to the hidden - charm molecular pentaquarks .",
    "there exits a @xmath9 bound state @xmath80 with the mass of @xmath87 ; a @xmath6 bound state of @xmath88 which can be considered as the partner of @xmath0 , with the main channel @xmath84 ; and a @xmath7 bound state @xmath85 of @xmath89 which can be considered as the partner of @xmath1 .",
    "these partners of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are worth searching in the future experiment .",
