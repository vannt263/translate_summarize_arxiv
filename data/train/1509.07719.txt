    "ribosome flow model on a ring has been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is a parametric dynamical system defined as follows : @xmath0    the parameters @xmath1 are real strictly positive numbers . as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "if the initial point lies in the hypercube @xmath2^n$ ] , then the system always stays within these limits .",
    "then this system models the occupancy levels of a circular chain of @xmath3 sites ( for example a circular dna ) , while @xmath1 are transition rates .",
    "in this work , we focus on the study of the equilibrium locus of this system and in particular we study its dependency on the parameters .",
    "we prove that when considering the set of all possible values of the parameters , the equilibrium locus is a smooth manifold with boundaries , while for a given value of the parameters , it is an embedded smooth and connected curve . for different values of the parameters , the curves are all isomorphic .",
    "moreover , we show how to build a homotopy between different curves obtained for different values of the parameter set .",
    "this procedure allows the efficient computation of the equilibrium point for each value of some first integral of the system .",
    "this point would have been otherwise difficult to be computed for higher dimensions .",
    "we illustrate this construction by some numerical experiments .",
    "given the parameters @xmath4 , the equilibrium point @xmath5^n$ ] must satisfy @xmath6 , where : @xmath7    for the sake of simplicity , we have denoted @xmath8 for @xmath1 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 . we shall now prove that @xmath11 is a smooth manifold with boundary .",
    "the jacobian matrix of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath8 is given by : @xmath13\\ ] ]    we want to determine the rank of this matrix .",
    "we shall use the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma::boundary ] if @xmath14 for some @xmath15 , then @xmath16 . if @xmath17 for some @xmath15 , then @xmath18 .",
    "this lemma is algebraically obvious and has a clear physical meaning . if the system is saturated in some bin , it is the case as well in all bins .",
    "if one bin is empty , so must be the other bins .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "the @xmath20 has full rank , that is @xmath21 . for @xmath22 or @xmath23 , @xmath24 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the jacobian matrix of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath9 is given by :    @xmath25\\ ] ]    if @xmath22 , then @xmath26 is in row echelon form and no pivot vanishes .",
    "thus in that case @xmath26 has full rank .",
    "if @xmath23 , a short computation also shows the matrix has full rank .    from this simple argument",
    "we conclude that the level set @xmath27 is indeed a properly embedded sub - manifold  @xcite of @xmath28^n$ ] with boundary such that @xmath29 .",
    "moreover @xmath30 .",
    "while our primary goal is to study the fiber over @xmath8 for each possible of value of the parameters , we start our investigation by considering the fiber over a given value of @xmath9 .",
    "this will allow in the sequel a deeper understanding of the main subject .",
    "given a point @xmath31^n$ ] , the fiber over @xmath9 is by definition the set @xmath32 .    when either @xmath33 or @xmath34 , the set @xmath35 is obviously @xmath36 .",
    "following lemma  [ lemma::boundary ] , we consider now a given value @xmath37 . in that case",
    "the set of @xmath35 is simply of the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 , since the system defining @xmath35 is linear in @xmath8 and homogeneous and the rank of @xmath20 is @xmath21 . in the sequel",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath40 is normalized : @xmath41 , so that it is uniquely defined .",
    "given the geometric form of @xmath35 , we can conclude for two different points @xmath9 and @xmath42 both in @xmath2^n$ ] , the fibers @xmath35 and @xmath43 either coincide or has empty intersection . in the latter case , their closures intersect at the origin .",
    "now let us consider the canonical projection : @xmath44 .",
    "let us we denote @xmath45 the projection from @xmath46 onto the first summand @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 is the restriction of @xmath45 to @xmath27 .",
    "also the differential of @xmath48 at some point @xmath49 of @xmath27 is the restriction of @xmath45 to the tangent space @xmath50 of @xmath27 at @xmath49 .",
    "the projection @xmath48 fails to be a local submersion at points @xmath49 where @xmath51 or equivalently if @xmath52 .",
    "this would happen if the rank of the jacobian matrix of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath9 at @xmath49 is strictly less than @xmath21 :    @xmath25\\ ] ]    let us show that this situation never occur .",
    "for this purpose , let @xmath53 the matrix obtained from @xmath26 by discarding the first column .",
    "then @xmath53 is a square @xmath54 matrix .",
    "but the determinant of this sub - matrix is : @xmath55\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when the coordinates of @xmath9 neither vanish nor are equal to @xmath56 ( see lemma  [ lemma::boundary ] ) , it is a sum of strictly positive terms .",
    "thus it never vanishes . when @xmath22 or @xmath23 , as mentioned in section  [ sec::parametric_manifold ] , the matrix @xmath26 has also full rank .",
    "eventually , these simple considerations yield the following lemma :    the canonical projection @xmath57 is a submersion at every point of @xmath27 .",
    "note that one could reach the same conclusion by considering the discriminant variety of the system  @xcite .",
    "now we turn our attention to the surjectivity of @xmath48 and prove the following lemma :    the canoncial projection @xmath57 is surjective .",
    "consider @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 .",
    "consider @xmath60 .",
    "then we can choose @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , we can choose @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 for all @xmath65",
    ".    we shall now prove that we can find @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 for all @xmath69 , provided we choose @xmath70 wisely .",
    "for that purpose , consider the map : @xmath71^n \\longrightarrow [ 0,1]^n , ( e_1 , \\cdots , e_n ) \\mapsto ( e_n(1-e_1 ) , e_1(1-e_2 ) , \\cdots , e_{n-1}(1-e_n))$ ] .",
    "the map is continuous and defined on a compact set . consider the subset @xmath72^n : \\sum_i e_i = 1\\}$ ] .",
    "being a closed subset of compact set , it is compact as well",
    ". therefore @xmath73 is compact .",
    "now let @xmath74 or @xmath75 be the euclidean norm in @xmath47 and let @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the minimum of @xmath78 .",
    "of course @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80^n$ ] , such that @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath82 , then @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that either @xmath84 or @xmath85 . in both cases , @xmath86 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath87 .",
    "in addition if one denotes by @xmath88 the standard basis of @xmath47 , each segment @xmath89 is mapped by @xmath90 to @xmath91 . in order to avoid cumbersome notations",
    ", we use the following rule : if @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( respectively @xmath94 ) denotes in fact @xmath95 ( respectively @xmath96 ) . with this rule",
    "granted , let us define the triangles : @xmath97\\}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath98 be the @xmath99dimensional pyramid which basis is @xmath100 and which top vertex is @xmath101 .",
    "the boundary @xmath102 of @xmath103 is the union @xmath104 .",
    "the image of @xmath103 by @xmath90 is the connected set whose boundary is @xmath105 .",
    "note that @xmath106\\ } \\subset f_{i+1}$ ] .",
    "therefore by the above considerations , @xmath107 contains the upper - right quadrant of the ball centered at the origin and of radius @xmath77 , i.e @xmath108 .",
    "it is now sufficient to choose @xmath70 such that @xmath109 . then @xmath110 .",
    "then for the given values of @xmath1 , there exists @xmath19 , such that @xmath111 .",
    "finally we shall prove this last lemma :    the canonical projection @xmath48 is proper .",
    "let @xmath112 be a compact set in @xmath113 .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath114 is compact in the subspace topology of @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath115^n : f({\\pmb{\\lambda}},{\\pmb{e } } ) = 0\\ } = ( k \\times [ 0,1]^n ) \\cap v_n$ ] , it a closed subset of a compact set .",
    "therefore it is compact as well in @xmath116^n)$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath114 is also compact in @xmath27 .",
    "stacking together these three results , we get the following theorem :    [ theo::fibers ] for each @xmath117 , the fiber of the canonical projection @xmath48 is a one - dimensional smooth manifold . moreover all the fibers are isomorphic .",
    "since the map @xmath48 is a surjective submersion , all the fibers are smooth manifold of dimension @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , since the map is proper , by thom s first isotopy theorem  @xcite , the map is locally a trivial fibration .",
    "since @xmath113 is connected , the fibers are all isomorphic one each other .",
    "one can wonder if two fibers can coincide or intersect elsewhere than at @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "consider two given points @xmath8 and @xmath121 in @xmath36 .",
    "if there exists @xmath122 , which lies on both fibers obver @xmath8 and @xmath121 , then relying on the notations of section  [ sec::fibers_over_e ] , we observe that the intersection @xmath123",
    ". therefore one can conclude with the following lemma .    for @xmath8 and @xmath121 in @xmath36 , the fibers over @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath121 coincide if and only if @xmath8 and @xmath121 are collinear , .",
    "now we shall prove that all fibers are connected .",
    "given theorem  [ theo::fibers ] , it is sufficient to prove that the fiber over @xmath124 is connected .",
    "as a matter of fact , in the sequel , the vector @xmath125 for @xmath126 will be denoted in bold font as follows @xmath127 .    for @xmath117 ,",
    "let us simply write @xmath128^n : \\pi({\\pmb{\\lambda}},{\\pmb{e } } ) = { \\pmb{\\lambda}}\\}$ ] for the fiber .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath129 contains the segment @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "we want to prove that @xmath129 is restricted exactly to this segment . for this purpose",
    "we shall consider the projection @xmath131 .",
    "the map @xmath90 is surjective .    indeed for any value @xmath61 , the point @xmath127 lies in @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the map @xmath90 is a submersion .",
    "the map @xmath90 fails to be a submersion at points where the kernel of the jacobian matrix @xmath26 ( for @xmath134 ) is orthogonal to the vector @xmath135^t$ ] .",
    "since the kernel is a one - dimension real vector space , for this condition to be satisfied , it is necessary that the @xmath136last columns of the jacobian matrix @xmath26 are linearly dependent .",
    "however , as mentioned above the determinant of this sub - matrix is a sum of strictly positive terms .",
    "thus it never vanishes on @xmath132 .",
    "hence , the map @xmath90 is indeed a submersion over @xmath132 .",
    "the map @xmath90 is proper .",
    "consider a compact subset @xmath137 . then @xmath112 is included in some closed interval @xmath138 \\subset ( 0,1)$ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath139 is a closed subset of @xmath132 , also included in @xmath140)$ ] .",
    "the latter set is closed and bounded in @xmath47 and thus is compact .",
    "therefore @xmath139 is a closed subset of a compact and is compact as well in @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath129 is closed in @xmath47 , @xmath139 is also compact in @xmath129 . finally , since @xmath141 , it is compact in the subset topology of the @xmath132 .",
    "the fibers of @xmath90 are all isomorphic .    given the threee previous lemmas and by ehresmann s theorem  @xcite , @xmath90 is a locally trivial fibration .",
    ", we used the thom first isotopy theorem , which is a generalization of it . in the latter case",
    "the use of the more general setting was necessary since @xmath27 is manifold with boundaries , while here @xmath132 is a mere manifold and the classical setting of ehresmann is enough . ]",
    "since @xmath142 is connected , all the fibers of @xmath90 are isomorphic .    therefore , it is sufficient to compute the fiber over @xmath143 to understand the common structure of all the fibers .",
    "so consider that @xmath144 .",
    "assume that @xmath145 .",
    "then given that @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 . on the one hand , by induction we get a decreasing sequence @xmath148 .",
    "on the other hand , we have @xmath149 . thus @xmath150 .",
    "thus we ends up with a contradiction .",
    "now let us assume that @xmath150 .",
    "then we get an increasing sequence @xmath151 . together with @xmath152",
    ", we get this time that @xmath145 .",
    "all together , we get that @xmath153 .",
    "then it is obvious that @xmath154 .",
    "hence the fiber is made of a single point .",
    "therefore all the fibers are singletons .",
    "thus there is a bijective submersion from @xmath132 to @xmath142 .",
    "there the two manifolds are diffeomorphic . then @xmath132 is connected . stacking this to theorem  [ theo::fibers ]",
    ", this yields the following corollary :    for each value of @xmath155 , the fiber @xmath156 is a smooth connected curve .",
    "moreover the fiber @xmath129 is the segment @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "we are now interested in analyzing the intersection between the fiber @xmath156 and the hyperplane @xmath157 .",
    "obviously , this requires that @xmath158 $ ] . as mentioned in  @xcite , for each @xmath159 and each @xmath160",
    ", there is a single equilibrium point in @xmath161 .",
    "moreover starting from any point in @xmath161 , the system converges toward this equilibrium point .    in the simple case of @xmath129 , we have immediately @xmath162 . in this section",
    ", we shall show how to find the equilibrium point @xmath163 for any admissible value of the parameters @xmath8 .",
    "consider a straight segment line in @xmath164 joining @xmath165 to another point @xmath166 : @xmath167 for @xmath168 .",
    "this yields an homotopy between the fiber @xmath169 and the fiber @xmath170 : @xmath171 where @xmath172^t \\in { \\mathbb r}^{n+1}$ ] .    as we have seen",
    "solving @xmath173 is extremely easy . for a given @xmath174 ,",
    "starting from the solution @xmath175 , we can follow a path embedded in @xmath161 that ends at the solution of @xmath176 .",
    "consider @xmath177^t$ ] such a path . by construction , we want it to satisfy for all @xmath178 $ ] : @xmath179 .",
    "this yields the following differential system : @xmath180 where @xmath181 are the components of @xmath100 .",
    "this is a special case of homotopy continuation methods  @xcite .",
    "this system yields to a newton like method for tracing the path @xmath182 , since we have : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath100 computed for the @xmath3 first coordinate at the point @xmath182 .",
    "one can easily write this differential equation explicitly .",
    "note that @xmath182 is always an equilibrium point for each value of @xmath185 . indeed given a value of @xmath186 , one can easily compute @xmath40 , as shown in section  [ sec::fibers_over_e ] .    in our case ,",
    "the system is particularly simple since @xmath100 is a quadratic function of @xmath182 .",
    "the procedure can be easily implemented .",
    "we have implemented the path tracing procedure in python . in the figure  [ fig::homotopy_3d ]",
    ", we show the homotopy path generated for a system with 3 bins .    , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the first equilibrium point @xmath189 is represented by a green ball , while the final equilibrium point @xmath190 is rendered as a red triangle .",
    "of course all over the path the constraint @xmath191 holds . ]",
    "we have also run the homotopy path tracing procedure with @xmath192 .",
    "the procedure allows to find efficiently the right equilibrium point in the second fiber , which would have been otherwise difficult to determine .",
    "we have studied the equilibrium locus of the ribosome flow model on a ring for an arbitrary number of bins .",
    "we have proven that for every value of the parameter vector @xmath8 , the equilibrium locus is a smooth curve .",
