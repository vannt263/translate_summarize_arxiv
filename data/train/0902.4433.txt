    "the purpose of this paper is to give a survey of our recent works on a classification theory of soliton solutions of the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation @xcite .",
    "we also explain the detailed structure of some of the soliton solutions obtained in this classification theory , and discuss a physical application of a subclass of those solutions , which is related to the resonant interactions of the solitary waves in shallow water .",
    "most of the materials in this paper are based on a series of lectures given by one of the authors ( yk ) at chinese academy of science in beijing after the international conference `` nonlinear waves - theory and applications '' , on june 9 - 12 , 2008 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank professors qing - ping liu , xing - biao hu and ke wu for the arrangement of the lectures , and mr .",
    "kai tian for making lecture notes .    in 1970 ,",
    "kadomtsev and petviashvili @xcite proposed a two - dimensional dispersive wave equation to study the stability of one soliton solution of the kdv equation under the influence of weak transverse perturbations .",
    "this equation is now referred to as the kp equation , and considered to be a prototype of the integrable nonlinear dispersive wave equations in two - dimension .",
    "the kp equation is a completely integrable system with remarkably rich mathematical structure which is well documented in several monographs ( see for examples , @xcite ) .",
    "these mathematical structures include the existence of @xmath1-soliton solutions , the lax formulation of the inverse scattering transform , and the existence of an infinite dimensional symmetries .",
    "however the real breakthrough in the kp theory occurred in 1981 by sato @xcite who realized that the solution of the kp equation is given by a gl@xmath8-orbit on an infinite dimensional grassmann manifold ( sato universal grassmannian ) , and the kp equation is just a plcker relation on the grassmannian .",
    "the present paper deals with a finite dimensional version of the sato theory , and in particular , we are interested in the solutions which are real and non - singular in the entire @xmath9-plane where they are localized along certain rays .",
    "it is quite important to recognize that the resonant interaction plays a fundamental role in multi - dimensional waves .",
    "the original description of the soliton interaction of the kp equation was based on a two - soliton solution found in the hirota form , which has the shape of  x \" describing an intersection of two lines with some angle and a shift of lines at the intersection ( the phase shift ) . in 1977 , miles @xcite pointed out that this two - soliton solution ( referred to as the  o - type \" solution , where  o \" stands for _ original _ ) becomes singular if the angle of the intersection is smaller than certain critical value . since the kp equation was proposed to describe _",
    "quasi_-two dimensional waves , it should admit solutions that provide good approximations for two soliton interaction with smaller angle .",
    "thus , it seems strange that one does not have a reasonable solution in the parameter regimes where the kp equation is supposed to give a better approximation .",
    "miles also found that at the critical angle the two line - solitons of the o - type solution interact resonantly , and a third wave ( soliton ) is created to make a  y - shape \" solution .",
    "indeed , it turns out that such y - shape resonant solutions are exact solutions of the kp equation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "after the discovery of the resonant phenomena in the kp equation , several numerical and experimental studies were performed to investigate resonant interactions in other _",
    "real _ two dimensional equations such as the ion - acoustic and shallow water wave equations under the boussinesq approximation ( see for examples @xcite ) .",
    "however , after these activities , no significant progress has been made in the study of the solution space or real applications of the kp equation .",
    "it would appear that the general perception was that there were not many new and significant results left to be uncovered in the soliton solutions of the kp theory .",
    "for the last 5 years , we have been working on the classification problem of the soliton solutions of the kp equation @xcite , and our studies have revealed a large variety of soliton solutions which were totally overlooked in the past . in this paper , we give a brief survey of our research and explain an application of our new soliton solutions to describe the resonant interaction of solitons in shallow water .    the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ c : kp ] , we describe an interesting connection between the kp equation and the burgers equation ( theorem [ kp - b ] ) , and then construct some exact solutions based on this connection . we show that the resonant interaction in the kp equation is a natural consequence of the mathematical structure of the kp equation , that is , the burgers equation gives a symmetry of the kp equation in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "the wronskian determinant structure of the solutions is derived from an extension of the burgers hierarchy ( theorem [ phrelation ] , see also @xcite ) .    in section",
    "[ c : sato ] , we present a brief introduction of the sato theory , and give a direct construction of the wronskian structure of the @xmath11-function ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the kp hierarchy is the set of the symmetries of the kp equation , and the geometric structure of the solutions of the kp hierarchy is given by the @xmath11-function .",
    "we explain the important role that the @xmath11-function plays in the integrability of the kp equation .",
    "in section [ grassmann ] , we give an elementary introduction of the real grassmann manifold gr@xmath0 , the set of @xmath1-dimensional subspaces of @xmath2 .",
    "this is necessary background information for the classification problem of the soliton solutions of the kp equation . in particular , we explain the basic structure of the @xmath11-function in terms of the schubert decomposition of the grassmannian gr@xmath0 .    in section [ c : classification ] , we present the main theorem of the classification problem of the soliton solution ( theorem [ derangement ] ) .",
    "this theorem states that the @xmath11-function identified as a point on gr@xmath0 generates a solution that has asymptotically @xmath4 line - solitons for @xmath5 and @xmath1 line - solitons for @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , these soliton solutions can be parametrized by the chord diagrams associated with certain permutation called _ derangements _ of the symmetry group @xmath12 .",
    "this type of solutions is called @xmath13-soliton solution .",
    "we give a new proof of the theorem , some of which did not appear in the previous papers . specifically in corollary [ pairing ] , we show how the conserved densities of the kp equation lead directly to establish the correspondence between the line - soliton solutions and the derangements of @xmath12 .    in section [ c:2 - 2soliton ] , we study the detailed structure of @xmath14-solitons defined on gr@xmath6 as a fundamental class of soliton solutions of the kp equation .",
    "we present the detailed description of the solutions based on the @xmath15 matrix which marks the point of gr@xmath6 .",
    "the solution is completely determined if one prescribes a specific data for this matrix .",
    "we then show that for some classes of @xmath14-soliton solutions , the matrix data is equivalent to _ asymptotic _ data such as the soliton locations and phase shifts , while for some other solution classes , one also need to specify _ internal _ data given by a local structure .    in section [ ivp ]",
    ", we discuss an application of our new solutions to the mach reflection in shallow water with a rigid wall , based on the results of section [ c:2 - 2soliton ] .",
    "the resonant interaction among the incident wave , the reflection wave and the mach stem is well described by our soliton solution , if we ignore the effect of the boundary layer at the wall .",
    "we also present a direct numerical simulation of the kp equation with a v - shape initial wave , which represents the reflection problem of the incident wave on an inclined wall ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the kp equation is the following partial differential equation in @xmath16 dimensions , @xmath17 when @xmath18 , this equation is referred to as the kpii equation , while the equation with @xmath19 is called the kp i equation .",
    "since we consider only the kpii equation in this paper , we simply refer to the kpii as the kp equation throughout the text .",
    "note when @xmath20 is independent of @xmath10 , the well - known kortweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation is obtained from ( [ kp ] ) @xmath21 which is why the kp equation is regarded as a @xmath22-dimensional extension of the kdv equation .",
    "physically , the kp equation was introduced to study the stability of the kdv soliton under the influence of weak transverse perturbations @xcite .",
    "so the kp equation should give a better approximation of the original physical system if the system depends weakly on the transverse direction , i.e. the waves are almost parallel to the @xmath10-axis .",
    "let @xmath23 be a function defined by @xmath24 then the kp equation ( [ kp ] ) takes the form @xmath25 integrating the above equation once with respect to @xmath26 and setting the integration constant to zero ( i.e. @xmath27 is assumed to be constant as @xmath28 ) , give the _ potential _ form of the kp equation , namely , @xmath29 we will henceforth refer ( [ pkp ] ) as the pkp equation for the function @xmath27 which plays an important role in our description of the soliton solutions .",
    "we next review an interesting connection between the kp equation and the burgers hierarchy , first established systematically in @xcite .",
    "this connection is the basis of our description of the fundamental structure of the soliton solutions discussed in this paper .",
    "let us first briefly review the cole - hopf transformation linking the heat ( linear ) and burgers hierarchies :    [ heat ] if @xmath30 is a solution of the set of linear equations , i.e. the heat hierarchy , @xmath31 then @xmath32 satisfies the following set of nonlinear equations , i.e. the burgers hierarchy , @xmath33    first , by induction , we prove that @xmath34f : = p_nf.\\ ] ] when @xmath35 , the above formula is just the definition of the function @xmath27 . now , suppose @xmath36f : = p_{n-1}f$ ] .",

    "note here that the burgers hierarchy is well - defined in the sense that all the members commute , because the equations for @xmath30 in ( [ heat ] ) are commute trivially .",
    "the burgers equation corresponds to @xmath39 in ( [ bh ] ) , i.e. the first nontrivial member of the hierarchy ( [ bh ] ) , and the members for @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 \\partial_{t_3}w&=\\partial_x(w_{xx}+3ww_x+w^3 ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] note that the even members of the hierarchy are _ dissipative _ , while the odd ones are _",
    "dispersive_. this feature is a key for the resonance phenomena in the soliton solutions of the kp equation ( see example  [ ex:12soliton ] ) .",
    "now we show the connection between the kp equation and the burgers hierarchy ( [ bh ] ) :    [ burgers - kp ] suppose @xmath42 is a common solution of ( [ bh23 ] ) with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then @xmath45 solves the pkp equation ( [ pkp ] ) .    expressing @xmath46 in terms of only the @xmath26-partial derivatives of @xmath27 ,",
    "we have @xmath47 then eliminating the common terms including @xmath48 , i.e. calculate @xmath49 , we obtain the pkp equation ( [ pkp ] ) .",
    "thus the kp equation contains the burgers hierarchy , and the next theorem combines the results of propositions [ heat ] and [ burgers - kp ] , which gives a _ linearization _ of the kp equation :    [ kp - b ] if @xmath50 satisfies the set of linear equations , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , then @xmath53 satisfies the pkp equation ( [ pkp ] ) .",
    "this implies that a solution of the kp equation obtained from the burgers hierarchy ( equivalently the set of linear equations ) has a dissipative behavior in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "in particular , one should note that a confluence of shocks  @xcite in the burgers equation corresponds to a fusion of solitons as shown by example  [ ex:12soliton ] of the next section .",
    "one should also note that the infinitely many commuting symmetries of the burgers hierarchy ( [ bh ] ) induces higher flows of the pkp hierarchy .",
    "in other words , proceeding in the same way as in proposition [ burgers - kp ] one could also obtain an equation for @xmath54 in the first @xmath55 variables @xmath56 , which form the @xmath55th member of the pkp hierarchy .",
    "the substitution @xmath57 then gives the corresponding member of the kp hierarchy .",
    "thus , the kp equation ( [ kp ] ) corresponds to the @xmath58 flow of the kp hierarchy , and the higher flows generate the infinitely many symmetries of the kp equations .",
    "the kp hierarchy plays an important role when we discuss the multi - soliton solutions as we show in this paper .",
    "we now consider some solutions of the kp equation obtained from the linear system ( [ heat ] ) .",
    "the general solution for this linear system with @xmath43 and @xmath59 admits the integral representation ( ehrenpreis principle ) @xmath60 with an appropriate measure @xmath61 and a proper contour @xmath62 in the complex plane .",
    "a particularly simple finite dimensional solution is recovered by choosing @xmath63 with arbitrary real constants @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and the contour @xmath67 . then @xmath68 with @xmath69 . here",
    "we assume @xmath65 to be positive , so that @xmath30 is positive definite , and also assume the ordering in the @xmath70-parameters , @xmath71 now let us give some explicit examples :    [ onesolitonexample ] consider the case with @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 . since @xmath53 , we can choose @xmath74 without altering the solution .",
    "so we take , with @xmath75 ,    @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "then we have @xmath78 which is called the one - soliton solution . the solution @xmath79 is localized in the @xmath9-plane along the line @xmath80",
    ", whose location is determined by the constant @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath82 the peak of the soliton determines the line , @xmath83 so that choosing @xmath84 the line of the peak crosses the origin . because of this",
    ", we often refer the one - soliton as a line - soliton ( in a local sense in general ) .",
    "we also note that in terms of the function @xmath85 , we have the following asymptotic values for @xmath86 with the ordering @xmath87 , @xmath88 and the solution @xmath89 , exponentially as @xmath28 .",
    "the change in the asymptotic value of the potential function @xmath27 for the one - soliton solution is due to fact that the exponential @xmath90 dominates over @xmath91 as @xmath92 , whereas the exponential @xmath91 dominates over @xmath90 as @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , the solution @xmath20 is localized along the phase transition line : @xmath94constant , where both exponential terms are in balance .",
    "this motivates labeling the one - soliton solution as the @xmath95$]-soliton which also represents a permutation @xmath96 of the index set @xmath97 , i.e. exchanging the values @xmath98 and @xmath99 by crossing the line - soliton .",

    "he observed that resonance occurs at the critical angle @xmath889 , and when the angle @xmath886 is smaller than @xmath889 , the o - type solution becomes singular ( recall that at the critical angle @xmath889 , one of the exponential term in the @xmath11-function vanishes ) .",
    "he also noticed a similarity between this resonant interaction and the mach reflection found in a shock wave interaction .",
    "this may be illustrated by the left figure of figure [ fig : mr ] , where an incidence wave shown by the vertical line is propagating to the right , and it hits a rigid wall with the angle @xmath1047 measured counterclockwise from the axis perpendicular to the wall ( see also @xcite ) . if the angle of the incidence wave ( equivalently the inclination angle of the wall ) is large , the reflected wave behind the incidence wave has the same angle @xmath886 , i.e. a regular reflection occurs .",
    "however , if the angle is small , then an intermediate wave called the mach stem appears as shown in figure [ fig : mr ] .",
    "the critical angle for the mach reflection is given by the angle @xmath889 .",
    "the mach stem , the incident wave and the reflected wave interact resonantly , and those three waves form a resonant triplet .",
    "the right one in figure [ fig : mr ] illustrates an equivalent system of the wave propagation in the left figure ( one should ignore the effect of viscosity on the wall , i.e. no boundary layer ) . at the point @xmath1048 , the initial wave has v - shape with the angle @xmath886 , which forms the initial data for the simulation .",
    "then the numerical simulation describes the reflection of line - soliton with an inclined wall , and these results explain well the appearance of the mach reflection in terms of the exact soliton solution of @xmath896-type .      the maximum amplitude for this problem occurs at the wall , called the maximum run - up , and this can be obtained by the formula ( [ omax ] ) for the o - type solution , i.e. @xmath1025 , and the formula ( [ stema ] ) for @xmath896-type solution .",
    "figure [ fig : maxa ] illustrates the maximum amplitude for various angles @xmath886 .",
    "notice that at the critical angle @xmath1049 , the amplitude takes four times higher than that of the incident wave ( this figure was first obtained in @xcite ) .",
    "one can also find the length of the mach stem ( i.e. the intermediate soliton of @xmath190$]-type ) from @xmath896-soliton solution , that is , for the point @xmath1050 of the resonant interaction of the triplet , we have @xmath1051 where @xmath1052 and the point o is assigned as @xmath861 .",
    "the angle @xmath1053 in figure [ fig : mr ] is then given by @xmath1054 this formula might be useful to determine the @xmath717-parameter for @xmath896-type soliton solution .",
