    "<S> the singular nature of a non - integer spiral phase plate allows easy manipulation of spatial degrees of freedom of photon states . using two such devices , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed very high dimensional ( @xmath0 ) spatial entanglement of twin photons generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion .    in the early 1990s , it was realized that the quantum state of a photon in a laguerre - gaussian laser mode lg@xmath1 is an eigenstate of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) operator , with eigenvalue @xmath2 ( @xmath3 integer ) @xcite . the mode functions lg@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) can be used as a basis of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , and thus to describe , within the paraxial approximation , a photon state represented by an arbitrary spatial wave function .    according to theory , </S>",
    "<S> the twin photons created in spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) are entangled in the full , infinite - dimensional ( spatial ) hilbert space ; in fact , they are maximally entangled @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several years ago , mair  _ et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrated oam entanglement in a 3d subspace of that hilbert space , in an experiment where they used integer - oam analyzers . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently proposed that spatial entanglement can be demonstrated in an _ </S>",
    "<S> infinite_-dimensional subspace @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by using _ </S>",
    "<S> fractional_-oam analyzers , in view of the fact that fractional oam states are coherent superpositions of an infinite number of lg@xmath1 states with integer oam . </S>",
    "<S> here we report an experimental implementation of this idea , employing two half - integer oam analyzers ; we confirm the predicted entanglement of fractional oam and deduce a dimensionality of @xmath6 per photon , the entangled space having a dimensionality @xmath7 .    , where @xmath8 is the step height , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the refractive indices of the spp and the surrounding medium , respectively , and @xmath11 is the wavelength of the incident light.,height=113 ]    the key element in our approach is the use of a spiral phase plate ( spp ) @xcite , shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spp ] , as part of our analyzer . </S>",
    "<S> this plate imprints an azimuth - dependent phase retardation on an incident field . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in phase retardation @xmath12 at azimuthal angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 is equal to @xmath15 , whereby the plate adds an average oam of @xmath16 per photon . by adjusting the spp parameters ( see caption of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spp ] ) , the spp index @xmath17 can be tuned to any desired value . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath17 is _ non - integer _ , the output field is _ not _ cylindrically symmetric ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quantumsetup](b ) ) and carries a mixed screw - edge dislocation in the near field , i.e.  a singularity with a transverse component ; this dislocation is associated with the radial edge of the spp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for all non - integer @xmath17 , the spp is characterized by two parameters , namely the step index @xmath17 itself and the orientation of the radial edge of the spp , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is varied by rotating the spp around the beam axis .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach involves the use of two fractional - oam analyzers ( one per arm ) in an spdc setup . </S>",
    "<S> such an analyzer consists of a non - integer spp , a single - mode fiber and a detector ; the orientations of the radial edges of the spps are varied ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : quantumsetup](a ) below ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the spps have a non - integer step index @xmath17 , the fractional oam states provide a natural basis to describe the two - photon state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each element of this fractional basis can be written as an @xmath17 and @xmath18 dependent superposition of an infinite number of lg@xmath1 states , extending over both @xmath3 and @xmath19 . because this superposition changes </S>",
    "<S> when we reorient the spp , we explore an _ </S>",
    "<S> infinite_-dimensional subspace of the full , ( spatial ) hilbert space by systematically varying @xmath18 ( at constant step index @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the contribution of lg@xmath1 modes with @xmath20 to this superposition is significant ; this is caused by the fact that the dislocation imprinted by the spp on the incident field has a mixed screw - edge character @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the most convenient implementation of this scheme is by choosing the non - integer part @xmath21 of the step index @xmath17 to be half - integer , i.e.  @xmath22 ; the states with @xmath23 and @xmath24 are then orthogonal ( independent of the integer part of @xmath17 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when we place an analyzer containing an spp with index @xmath17 in the signal path of a spdc setup , and one containing an spp with index @xmath25 in the idler path , the coincidence probability as a function of the orientations of the two spps is predicted to be @xcite @xmath26 viz .  a parabolic coincidence fringe with a visibility of unity . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath27 depends on the overlap of the radial part of the two - photon state as emanating from the spdc crystal , with the radial part of the fiber mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this parabolic coincidence fringe , which is a function of only the _ relative _ orientation of the two spps , reveals the entanglement of the twin photons .    </S>",
    "<S> the key to success in the experiment lies in the analyzers or , more specifically , in the two spps . </S>",
    "<S> our spps have been manufactured using a polymer molding technique starting from a micro - machined mold , yielding identical plates with @xmath28 at the ( degenerate spdc ) wavelength of 813  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the step of each spp is not abrupt but in fact a linear ramp with an azimuthal width of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the plates show a central ` anomaly ' with a diameter of about @xmath30 m @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the plate has an rms deviation of @xmath31  nm from the ideal shape @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the high - dimensional nature of the @xmath32 spp is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modal](a ) , which shows a modal decomposition for mode order @xmath33 if the input is a fundamental gaussian lg@xmath34 ( i.e.  the fiber mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of this truncated decomposition is only @xmath35 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modal](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> when truncating at mode order 20 ( corresponding to 231 lg modes ) , the fidelity becomes @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation shows that a fidelity of 98% requires about 125000 lg modes . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that these results remain essentially unchanged when using the actual topography of our spp plates ; in particular , the finite azimuthal width of the step has no significant effect .        </S>",
    "<S> the spdc setup is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quantumsetup](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pump laser is a @xmath37  mw krypton - ion laser ( spectra physics 2060 ) operating at a wavelength of @xmath38  nm . </S>",
    "<S> its output is weakly focused on a nonlinear crystal ( bbo ) , with beam waist @xmath39  mm . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal has a thickness @xmath40  mm and has been cut for nearly collinear type - ii spdc . before inserting a fractional - oam analyzer in each arm , we test the setup by observing polarization entanglement ; we achieve 95% and 92% fringe visibility in the crystal ( h , v ) and @xmath41 basis , respectively @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we fix the polarizers in the crystal basis and insert a fractional - oam analyzer with spp index @xmath42 in the signal path and an analyzer with spp index @xmath43 in the idler path . the spdc cone - crossings in the far field </S>",
    "<S> are found to be much larger than the far - field intensity pattern of the analyzer mode , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quantumsetup](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spdc intensity varies about @xmath44 over the spp diffraction profile .    the spps have to be aligned with great precision . in particular , both the rotation axis and the center of each spp have to be aligned , with a precision of order @xmath45 m , with the core of the corresponding single - mode fiber </S>",
    "<S> only when this amount of care is invested in aligning the optical elements , can one rotate both spps to make use of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 degrees of freedom without losing any signal .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quantumresults ] : four coincidence fringes ( obtained for idler spp - settings @xmath48 ) as a function of the signal spp - setting @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> these fringes are shown together with the expected coincidence fringes as predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coincidenceprobability ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data show that the coincidence - count rate as a function of the orientation of the signal spp has a parabola - like shape . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , when the idler spp is re - oriented , we see that the fringe shifts accordingly . consequently , we find , according to the quantum - mechanical prediction , that the parabolic coincidence fringe depends only on the _ relative _ orientation of the spps .     of the spp in the signal arm . </S>",
    "<S> the parabolic fringe shifts concordantly with the orientation @xmath47 of the spp in the idler arm.,width=244 ]    analytical calculations in which one assumes a completely separable ( as opposed to entangled ) two - photon state while oam is conserved per pair , result in fringes of _ zero _ visibility . in the context of a quantum - mechanical description of the spdc process </S>",
    "<S> , the experimental data show thus entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> however , based on the present set of data , we can not prove quantum non - locality using the two - dimensional clauser - horne - shimony - holt version of the bell inequality @xcite , in contrast to what we predicted earlier @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionality of the hilbert space in which each photon of the pair lives , must be @xmath49 as can be concluded from the parabolic shape of the fringes in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quantumresults ] ; after all , for @xmath50 , as in polarization entanglement , a sinusoidal fringe would appear . regretfully , the fringes do not directly betray the precise dimensionality ; nevertheless , we can make an estimate based on the following considerations .    </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionality @xmath51 of the subspace probed in the experiment is either limited by the number of entangled modes emitted by the bbo crystal , expressed by the schmidt number @xmath52 @xcite , or by the ( spatial ) modal bandwidth of the analyzers , @xmath53 . to estimate @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , we follow law and eberly s approximate analytical theory @xcite , @xmath54 our experimental values for the pump - beam waist @xmath55 , crystal length @xmath56 and the pump wavenumber @xmath57 result in a lower limit to the schmidt number , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between the approximate and exact theories for the value of @xmath52 shows that , for high values of @xmath52 , as in the present case , the approximate theory yields a severe underestimation .    </S>",
    "<S> to make sure that our analyzers are not limiting the dimensionality of the probed subspace to @xmath59 , we need to establish that their modal bandwidth @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by examining the conversion efficiency of the two analyzers , positioned as an optical train in a classical - optics experiment : we use one analyzer to convert the fundamental gaussian mode from a laser beam to an extended superposition of lg modes , while the other is used to convert this superposition back to the fundamental gaussian mode . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion efficiency , which we found to be 98% , basically tells us how well the modal spectra of the two analyzers overlap . </S>",
    "<S> combined with knowledge of the modal spectrum of a single analyzer ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : modal ] ) , this value yields the modal bandwidth @xmath53 of the analyzers . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental value of 98% @xcite , which is the fidelity of one analyzer mode as measured by the other analyzer , corresponds to a modal bandwidth @xmath61 ( which corresponds , in fact , to the diffraction limit of the full optical setup ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the analyzers are not a bottleneck in this experiment and we can therefore conclude that the dimensionality of the probed hilbert space is @xmath62 .    in conclusion , we have reported an experiment on spdc twin - photons demonstrating , within the quantum - mechanical description of spdc , the entanglement of twin photons with respect to their fractional oam . as this experiment involves a unitary transformation of basis from the natural lg states with integer oam to a new basis with fractional oam , the data explicitly shows that a very large part of the spatial hilbert space is entangled , the dimensionality of which we estimate as @xmath6 per photon . </S>",
    "<S> the entangled space that we have probed in this experiment only represents one particular cross section of the full hilbert space of ( spatial ) two - photon states . </S>",
    "<S> presently , we are designing analyzers with alternative spatial geometries and step heights , and , additionally , analyzers that operate on both amplitude and phase of the photon state . </S>",
    "<S> experiments with such analyzers will possibly allow us to sample a large variety of cross sections of the full hilbert space . </S>"
