    "the problem of extracting as much information as possible , from an available qcd or qed truncated perturbation series ( tps ) of an observable , and including this information in a resummed result , was the focus of several works during the last twenty years .",
    "most of these resummation methods are based on the available tps only .",
    "some of these latter methods eliminate the unphysical dependence of the tps on the renormalization scale ( rscl ) and scheme ( rsch ) by fixing them in the tps itself . among these methods",
    "are the blm fixing motivated by large@xmath13 considerations @xcite , principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , effective charge method ( ech ) @xcite ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for a related method ) . some of the more recent approaches in this direction include approaches related with the method of `` commensurate scale relations '' @xcite , an approach using an analytic form of the coupling parameter @xcite , ech  related approaches @xcite , a method using expansions in the two  loop coupling parameter @xcite expressed in terms of the lambert function @xcite , methods using conformal transformations either for the borel expansion parameter @xcite or for the coupling parameter @xcite",
    ". a basically different method consists in replacing the tps by pad approximants ( pa s ) which provide a resummation of the tps such that the resummed results show weakened rscl and rsch dependence @xcite .",
    "in particular , the diagonal pad approximants ( dpa s ) were shown to be particularly well motivated since they are rscl  independent in the approximation of the one  loop evolution of the coupling @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "an additional advantage of pa s is connected with the fact that they surmount the purely polynomial structure of the tps s on which they are based , and thus offer a possibility of accounting for at least some of the nonperturbative contributions , via a strong mechanism of quasianalytic continuation implicitly contained in pa s .",
    "recently , we proposed a generalization of the method of dpa s which achieves the exact perturbative rscl independence of the resummed result @xcite . while this procedure in its original form was restricted to the cases where the number of available tps terms beyond the leading order ( lo : @xmath0@xmath15 ) is odd , it was subsequently extended to the remaining cases where this number is even @xcite .",
    "this would then apply to those qcd observables where the number of such known terms is two ( nnlo,@xmath0@xmath1 ) .",
    "in @xcite we also speculated on ways how to eliminate the leading rsch  dependence from our approximants @xmath16 , and proposed for the nnlo case a simple way following the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) .",
    "it turns out that the way proposed there does not work properly in practice since no minimum of the pms equation @xmath17 [ cf .",
    "( 40 ) there ] can be found .",
    "the dependence of our approximants on the rsch ",
    "parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the original tps is definitely a problem when the approximants are applied to the low  energy observables like the bjorken polarized sum rule ( bjpsr ) at the low momentum transfer of the virtual photon , e.g. @xmath20@xmath21 @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we address this problem .",
    "for the nnlo tps case , we construct in section ii an extended version @xmath22 of our approximants , in which the dependence on the leading rsch - parameter @xmath2 is successfully eliminated by application of a variant of pms conditions @xmath23 .",
    "this procedure can be extended in a straightforward way to the cases where more terms are known in the tps , e.g. the nnnlo cases available now in qed , but we will not discuss such cases here . in section iii ,",
    "we apply our approximant to the bjpsr at such @xmath24 where three quark flavors are assumed active , e.g. @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "while the approximant at this stage is an rscl  independent and @xmath2independent generalization of the diagonal pad approximant ( dpa ) @xmath25 $ ] , it still contains @xmath3dependence comparable to that of the ech @xcite and tps ",
    "pms @xcite methods .",
    "subsequently , we fix the value of @xmath3 in our , the ech and the tps  pms approximants so that pa s of a modified ( rscl and rsch  independent ) borel transform of these approximants yield the correct location of the leading infrared ( ir ) renormalon pole .",
    "thus , in the approximants we implicitly use @xmath26functions which go beyond the last perturbatively calculated order of the observable ( nnlo ) , in order to incorporate the afore ",
    "mentioned nonperturbative information . in section",
    "iv we then compare the values of these resummation approximants with the values for the bjpsr extracted from experiments , and obtain predictions for @xmath27 .",

    "the ( d)pa methods , when applied directly to the ( nnlo ) tps s , are trying to include some nonperturbative contributions through quasianalytic continuation of the tps from the perturbative ( small@xmath73 ) to the nonperturbative ( large@xmath73 ) region . in the course of this continuation , the pole structure of the borel transform of the sum may be missed , but some other nonperturbative ( but less singular ) features of the sum itself may be reproduced well .",

    "<S> a renormalization  scale  invariant generalization of the diagonal pad approximants ( dpa ) , developed previously , is extended so that it becomes renormalization  scheme  invariant as well . </S>",
    "<S> we do this explicitly when two terms beyond the leading order ( nnlo,@xmath0@xmath1 ) are known in the truncated perturbation series ( tps ) . at first </S>",
    "<S> , the scheme dependence shows up as a dependence on the first two scheme parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> invariance under the change of the leading parameter @xmath2 is achieved via a variant of the principle of minimal sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the subleading parameter @xmath3 is fixed so that a scale and scheme  invariant borel transform of the resummation approximant gives the correct location of the leading infrared renormalon pole . </S>",
    "<S> the leading higher  twist contribution , or a part of it , is thus believed to be contained implicitly in the resummation . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the approximant to the bjorken polarized sum rule ( bjpsr ) at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for the most recent data and the data available until 1997 , respectively , and obtained @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> very similar results are obtained with the grunberg s effective charge method and stevenson s tps principle of minimal sensitivity , if we fix @xmath3parameter in them by the afore - mentioned procedure . </S>",
