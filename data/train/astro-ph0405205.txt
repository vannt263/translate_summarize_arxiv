    "multiply - imaged lensed quasars and close quasar pairs provide valuable probes of structure in the intergalactic medium . by comparing the absorption patterns in the spectra of adjacent quasar images",
    "one can gauge the similarity in the underlying matter distributions along the lines of sight and hence constrain the sizes of absorbing structures .",
    "previous studies at small separations ( @xmath10 ) have typically provided lower limits to the scale of ly@xmath3  absorbers over a wide range in redshift , with weak upper constraints of @xmath11 comoving kpc derived by assuming spherical clouds @xcite .",
    "observations of pairs at wider separations ( @xmath12 ) have shown evidence that some ly@xmath3  absorbers span @xmath13 comoving mpc @xcite and possibly up to 30 comoving mpc @xcite .",
    "the majority of studies on lensed quasars and quasar pairs have relied on matching individual absorption lines between spectra .",
    "however , high - resolution spectra ( fwhm @xmath14 km  s@xmath15 ) are required to completely resolve these features .",
    "in addition , the crowding of lines in the high - redshift ly@xmath3  forest often prevents the identification of single absorbers .",
    "an alternate approach reflecting the continuity of the underlying density field is to compute the correlation of transmitted flux along parallel lines of sight .",
    "this robust statistic is quickly computed and can be easily compared to numerical simulations of large - scale structure .    as an extension to studying the matter distribution , correlations in the ly@xmath3  forest",
    "have been proposed as a tool for constraining the cosmological constant through a variant of the alcock - paczyski  test @xcite .",
    "the alcock - paczyski  test takes advantage of the fact that , for a homogeneous sample of objects , the characteristic radial and transverse sizes should be equal . in the case of the ly@xmath3  forest , one can compare the correlation length of absorbing structures along the line of sight to the correlation length in the transverse direction .",
    "the velocity separation , @xmath16 , between objects along the line of sight is simply given by their redshifts , @xmath17 in contrast , the transverse velocity separation , @xmath18 , between objects at redshift @xmath19 with angular separation @xmath1  depends on the cosmological parameters implicit in the hubble constant , @xmath20 , and angular diameter distance , @xmath21 , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proper linear separation .",
    "one approach to exploiting the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath18 is to directly compare the autocorrelation of transmitted flux along single lines of sight to the crosscorrelation between spectra of sources at a variety of angular separations @xcite .",
    "an alternate method compares observed crosscorrelations to those determined from linear theory @xcite or from artificial spectra drawn from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found agreement between the crosscorrelations and autocorrelations among spectra of several @xmath24 quasar pairs over a wide range in separation ( although see the discussion on spectral resolution below ) . in the future ,",
    "large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite should greatly increase the number of quasar pairs available for such studies .",
    "we present results for two pairs of quasars at a novel combination of high redshift and moderate separation .",
    "the closely separated a and c images ( @xmath25 ) of the bright @xmath26 lensed system qso 1422 + 2309 @xcite have been previously examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently discovered an additional faint source , qso 1424 + 2255 ( @xmath27 ) ( therein referred to as q1422b ) , at a separation @xmath28 from the lensed system . in this study",
    ", we compare the sightlines toward qso 1422 + 2309a ( herein referred to as q1422 ) and qso 1424 + 2255 ( herein referred to as q1424 to avoid confusion with the b image of q1422 ) .",
    "we additionally investigate the @xmath29 pair at @xmath30 discovered in the sloan digital sky survey , sdssp j@xmath31  ( herein q1439a ) and sdssp j@xmath32  ( herein q1439b ) @xcite . for each pair ,",
    "the similarity in quasar redshifts allows us to study the transverse properties of the ly@xmath3  forest and intervening metal systems over a large pathlength .",
    "our results should provide a valuable resource for comparison with numerical simulations of large - scale structure .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we present our observations together with a general overview of the data .",
    "we compute the flux correlation functions in the ly@xmath3  forest in  3 and statistically examine the similarity between sightlines as a function of flux . in ",
    "4 we analyze the effects of photon noise and instrumental resolution on the correlation functions .",
    "our results are summarized in  5 , with an inventory of unpublished metal absorption systems presented in the appendix .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "our observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we observed all four quasars under good to excellent seeing conditions over the period 2000 march to 2002 june using the keck echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) @xcite in echellette mode .",
    "additional observations of q1424 were provided by c. steidel while additional observations of q1439a were provided by l. hillenbrand .",
    "all exposures were taken at the parallactic angle except for one exposure of q1439b at an airmass near 1.0 , where chromatic atmospheric dispersion is only a minor concern .",
    "the raw ccd frames for q1422 , q1439a , and q1439b were processed and the 2-d echelle spectra extracted using the makee software package .",
    "reduction of q1424 data was performed using a suite of iraf scripts , as described in @xcite . for each night",
    "we used the extracted orders from at least one standard star ( feige 34 , bd+284211 , and/or hz 44 ) to determine an instrumental response function with which to derive relative flux calibrations .",
    "the calibrated orders of all exposures from all nights were then converted to vacuum heliocentric wavelengths and combined to produce a single continuous spectrum per object ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we use a binned pixel size of 20 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "normalized spectra were produced by fitting continua to the final reduced versions .",
    "the majority of observations were made using a 075 slit .",
    "however , inspection of the spectra extracted from exposures taken with different slits widths revealed very little difference in resolution , likely due to favorable seeing . for the combined spectra",
    "we adopt a measured spectral resolution fwhm = 55 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the final esi spectra for q1424 , q1439a , and q1439b have typical s / n @xmath36 per resolution element in the ly@xmath3  forest , while q1422 has s / n @xmath37 .",
    "we restrict our analysis of the ly@xmath3  forest to the the wavelength region between each quasar s ly@xmath3  and o  vi  emission lines . to avoid a proximity effect from the quasar , we include only those pixels at least 10,000 km  s@xmath15  blueward of the quasar s ly@xmath3  emission .",
    "we further include only pixels at least 1,000 km  s@xmath15  redward of ly@xmath38  and o  vi  emission to avoid any confusion with the ly@xmath38  forest or intrinsic o  vi  absorption . for q1422 and q1424",
    "this yields a redshift interval @xmath39 with mean redshift @xmath40 .",
    "for q1439 a and b , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . due to the high redshift of q1439",
    "a and b , the ly@xmath3  forest in the spectra of these sources extends over the strong night sky lines [ o  i ]  @xmath435577 and na  i  @xmath435890,5896 . in our analysis",
    "we exclude the narrow ( @xmath44  ) regions around these lines .",
    "a visual comparison of the ly@xmath3  forest in the paired spectra suggests that the most striking similarity occurs among the strongest absorption features ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "these regions often appear to be similar along adjacent lines of sight , as do regions where the absorption is nearly zero ( possible `` voids '' relatively free of absorbing material ) .",
    "matches among intermediate strength features are less obvious , which suggests that the structures giving rise to those lines may not be as coherent over the separation between sightlines",
    ". however , many strong lines and regions of nearly zero absorption that do not coincide between spectra can also be identified .",
    "the alignment of a subset of features may occur purely by chance .",
    "our spectral coverage also allows us to investigate the extent to which metal systems span parallel lines of sight .",
    "two strong c  iv  systems appear toward q1439b at @xmath8 , separated by 1700 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "each system has a large rest equivalent width , @xmath45  .",
    "however , no c  iv  appears at this redshift toward q1439a .",
    "in contrast , a low - ionization system containing mg  ii  and fe  ii  does appear along both sightlines at @xmath46 , separated by only @xmath47 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "a single , extended absorber responsible for the low - ionization features would have a linear size @xmath48 @xmath6  proper kpc .",
    "these lines may alternatively arise from the chance intersection of separate , clustered absorbers .",
    "weaker c  iv  systems appear in both q1422 and q1424 separated by @xmath49 km  s@xmath15  at @xmath50 , where the separation between sightlines is 290 @xmath6  proper kpc .",
    "we expand further on the properties of metal systems in the appendix .    in order to assess the impact of spectral characteristics on our ly@xmath3  forest results we additionally employed a deep , high - resolution spectrum of q1422 + 2309a .",
    "observations were made with the keck high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) @xcite using a 0574 slit .",
    "this yields a spectral resolution fwhm = 4.4 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "reductions were performed as described @xcite .",
    "in addition to the data from that work , which used the red cross - disperser only , we include subsequent exposures taken with the uv - blazed cross - disperser installed to provide additional coverage of the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "the final spectrum was binned to give a constant velocity width for each pixel of 2.1 km  s@xmath15 , with a typical s / n per resolution element of @xmath51 .",
    "the correlation of transmitted flux in the spectra of closely separated quasars provides a simple means of quantifying the degree of similarity in the matter distribution along adjacent sightlines .",
    "we define the unnormalized correlation , @xmath52 , of the spectra of two sources separated on the sky by an angle @xmath53 as @xmath54             [ { f}(0,{v_{\\| } } ) - \\bar{{f}}(0)],\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the continuum - normalized flux , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the mean fluxes along the two sightlines , @xmath58  is the line - of - sight velocity , @xmath59  is the longitudinal velocity lag , and @xmath60 is the total number of pixels in each spectrum within the region of interest .",
    "the sum is performed over all available pixels at a given velocity lag , of which there will be @xmath61 for a pixel size @xmath62 .",
    "the normalized correlation value can be computed by dividing eq .",
    "( 3 ) by the standard deviation in each input spectrum .",
    "we have chosen a pixel size for the combined spectra to give roughly 3 pixels / resolution element . however , we note that the @xmath63 factor in eq .",
    "( 3 ) implies that the value of the correlation will be insensitive to pixel size so long as the spectrum is well sampled .",
    "the increase in the sum created by using a larger number of smaller pixels will be offset by the increase in @xmath60 so long as there are @xmath64 pixels / resolution element .",
    "using pixels larger than the spectral resolution will introduce smoothing effects ( see  4 ) .    in order to assess the coherence of absorbing structures across adjacent sightlines , we compute the crosscorrelation of transmitted flux in the ly@xmath3  forest in the spectra of our quasar pairs . as a reference",
    ", we also determine the autocorrelation , @xmath65 , along lines of sight toward individual objects . at these high redshifts ,",
    "h  i  ly@xmath3  absorption will strongly dominate over contaminating absorption from lower - redshift metals such as c  iv  and mg  ii .",
    "the correlation functions should therefore accurately reflect the distribution of neutral hydrogen to within the present measurement errors .",
    "all correlations are computed in single - pixel steps , which are 20 km  s@xmath15  for the esi data .",
    "figure 5 displays the autocorrelation function for each quasar along with the crosscorrelation functions between adjacent sightlines . both in the case of q1422/q1424 and q1439a / b , a clear peak in the crosscorrelation at zero lag indicates a genuine similarity between sightlines .",
    "undulations in the correlation functions arising from the chance superposition of unrelated lines constitute the dominant source of uncertainty in the peak values ( see discussion on photon noise below ) .",
    "pixel - to - pixel variations in the correlations are themselves clearly correlated .",
    "however , we find that the overall distributions of values away from the central peaks are very nearly gaussian .",
    "we therefore take the standard deviation of pixels in the `` noise '' region , which we define to be where 2000 km  s@xmath15  @xmath66 18000 km  s@xmath15 , as the @xmath67 error in a correlation peak value . in this region",
    "we expect no underlying signal , however the correlation is still computed from at least half of the available pixels . since the sum in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is computed over fewer pixels as the velocity lag increases , yet the factor @xmath63 remains constant , the amplitude of the noise features will tend to diminish as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of pixels included in the sum in eq .",
    "( 3 ) at lag @xmath16 . therefore , in order to match the amplitude of the noise at @xmath70 , we multiply the correlation at each lag by a scale factor @xmath71 before computing the standard deviation , where @xmath72 for the range in velocity lag defined above this is a modest correction . including only lags where at least half of the @xmath73 ly@xmath3  pixels in each spectrum overlap limits @xmath71 to at most @xmath74 . for the range in velocity lag shown in fig .",
    "5 , @xmath75 .",
    "our results for the crosscorrelations are summarized in table 2 . using the above estimate for the error ,",
    "the peak in the crosscorrelation for q1422/q1424 ( q1439a / b ) is significant at the @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) level .",
    "this strongly suggests coherence in the absorbing structures on the scale of the @xmath5 @xmath6  proper kpc transverse separation between sightlines .",
    "the marginal consistency of the peak values with one another likely reflects the similarity in sightline separation and redshift for the two quasar pairs .",
    "the zero - lag values of the autocorrelations , which give the variance in the flux for these sections of the ly@xmath3  forest , are 0.0950 for q1422 , 0.0796 for q1424 , 0.0862 for q1439a , and 0.1000 for q1439b .",
    "thus , the normalized crosscorrelation peaks are @xmath78 for q1422/q1424 and @xmath79 for q1439a / b .",
    "the flux crosscorrelations demonstrate that at least some ly@xmath3  absorbers span the separation between our paired lines of sight .",
    "however , it does not indicate whether the similarity between sightlines depends on the strength of the absorber .",
    "the crowded nature of the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath80 , together with the present spectral resolution , greatly inhibits a study of individual lines .",
    "however , we are able to look at the agreement between absorption features on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "our goal is to determine whether the similarity in flux between paired spectra depends on the amount of absorption for an individual pixel .",
    "first we first select those ly@xmath3  forest pixels in one spectrum ( q1422 or q1439a ) whose flux falls within a specified range .",
    "we then identify the pixels in the companion spectrum with matching wavelengths and compute their flux distribution .",
    "comparing the distribution in this subsample to that in all ly@xmath3  forest pixels in the companion spectrum allows us to evaluate whether there exists an overabundance of pixels in the specified flux range relative to that expected on random chance .",
    "the results for q1422/q1424 and q1439a / b are shown in figures 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "each panel shows the normalized distribution of q1424 or q1439b pixels in the indicated subsample along with the distribution of all ly@xmath3  forest pixels in that spectrum .",
    "the range of flux in q1422 or q1439a for each subsample is chosen to be significantly larger than the typical flux uncertainty . in each case , we compute the two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov statistic , which is the maximum difference between the cumulative fractions of pixels in the subsample and of all pixels in the forest , along with the associated likelihood of randomly obtaining a smaller statistic than the one observed . the number of pixels in each subsample is also shown .",
    "the clearest results occur at extreme levels of absorption",
    ". pixels in q1422 ( q1439a ) either near saturation , @xmath81 , or near the continuum , @xmath82 , tend to strongly coincide with pixels of similar flux in q1424 ( q1439b ) .",
    "intermediate flux pixels appear to be less strictly matched , with the exception of pixels in q1422 with @xmath83 . for certain subsamples , namely @xmath84 in q1422 and @xmath85 in q1439a ,",
    "the distribution of fluxes in the companion spectrum is consistent with a random selection .",
    "this seems to confirm the visual appraisal that strong absorbers and regions relatively free of absorbing material tend to span adjacent lines of sight more readily than do absorbers of intermediate strength .    while each sample includes enough pixels to produce a statistically significant result , a few caveats are worth considering .",
    "systematic errors in continuum fitting might artificially create clusters of pixels with low absorption near the same wavelength in pairs of spectra .",
    "similarly , errors in sky - subtraction that are repeated between spectra might create false coincidences of pixels near zero flux .",
    "multiple independent continuum fits resulted in typical differences of @xmath86 in flux on scales of @xmath87  .",
    "we likewise find no evidence for large systematic errors in the sky subtraction .",
    "given that the resulting uncertainties are significantly smaller than the range in flux used to define a subsample in figures 6 & 7 , these effects should only be a minor concern .    we stress that comparing transmitted fluxes does not strictly yield a clear physical interpretation .",
    "pixels of intermediate flux commonly occur along the wings of strong features .",
    "they will therefore tend to cluster less readily than pixels near the continuum or near saturation , especially if the strong lines shift in velocity between spectra .",
    "moreover , agreement in flux does not necessarily indicate agreement in optical depth .",
    "since transmitted flux decreases exponentially with optical depth , @xmath88 , the difference in flux for a given fractional change in @xmath88 will depend on the value of @xmath88 itself . for a small characteristic change between sightlines , @xmath89 , the greatest scatter in flux",
    "is expected for @xmath90 , with the scatter decreasing as @xmath91 or as @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether the enhanced agreement in flux among pixels with flux near the continuum or near saturation indicates that the corresponding gas is more homogeneous on these scales than the gas giving rise to intermediate absorption features .",
    "more specific insights may be drawn by comparing our measured flux distributions to those derived from numerical simulations .",
    "comparing the longitudinal and transverse flux correlation functions ( or power spectra , equivalently ) in the ly@xmath3  forest has been been explored by several authors as a means of measuring the cosmological geometry via the alcock - paczyski  test .",
    "this application primarily requires a sample of sightlines large enough to overcome cosmic variance .",
    "however , some question remains regarding the dependence of the correlation functions on data characteristics such as signal - to - noise ratio and resolution .",
    "it is particularly important to know to what extent the autocorrelation measures the physical correlation length along the line of sight rather than the instrumental resolution . for additional discussion on the effects of spectral characteristics",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .    in the preceding analysis we assumed that the chance alignment of unrelated absorption features dominated over photon noise in producing uncertainty in the flux correlations .",
    "to justify this , we recomputed the autocorrelation for the esi spectrum of q1422 after adding increasing levels of gaussian random noise .",
    "the results appear nearly identical for s / n @xmath7 per resolution element ( figure 8) .",
    "a spike at @xmath93 appears in the autocorrelation function as the variance in the noise becomes comparable to the intrinsic variance in the absorption features .",
    "however , no such jump is expected to occur in the crosscorrelation since the photon noise in the two spectra should be uncorrelated . large sets of moderate s / n spectra may therefore be more useful than smaller sets of high s / n for this type of work .    to address the effects of spectral resolution on the autocorrelation we have synthesized moderate- and low - resolution spectra from a high - quality keck hires spectrum of q1422 ( resolution fwhm = 4.4 km  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "in each test case we first tune the spectral resolution by convolving the hires data with a gaussian kernel and then compute the resulting autocorrelation function .",
    "the results for spectra with resolution fwhm = 4.4 ( unsmoothed ) , 15 , 55 , and 200 km  s@xmath15  are plotted in figure 9 .",
    "very little difference exists between the autocorrelation functions computed from the unsmoothed hires data and from the data smoothed to fwhm = 15 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the correlation in the unsmoothed hires data is an accurate measure of the intrinsic correlation in the ly@xmath3  forest ( subject to cosmic variance and redshift - space distortions ) .",
    "the ly@xmath3  lines are already smoothed by their thermal width and easily resolved with hires . however , when the spectrum is degraded to fwhm = 55 km  s@xmath15 , similar to esi data , the autocorrelation is clearly broadened and diminished in amplitude .",
    "( we note that the autocorrelation measured from this `` synthetic '' esi spectrum is nearly identical to that computed from the real esi data . ) at even lower resolution , comparable to keck / lris or vlt / fors2 , the spectral resolution dominates over the intrinsic correlation length .    as the spectral resolution decreases , the peak of the autocorrelation also incorporates more of the outlying noise ( random undulations in the correlation function at @xmath94 ) . at large velocity lags ( @xmath95 km  s@xmath15 ) , disagreement between the high - resolution and low - resolution cases may be due in part to these noise features .",
    "better agreement may result when the correlation function is averaged over many sightlines .",
    "a more subtle issue is how spectral resolution affects the agreement between autocorrelation and crosscorrelation functions .",
    "to address this , we degraded the resolution of our esi data to mimic observations using a lower resolution instrument ( fwhm = 200 km  s@xmath15 ) and then recomputed the correlations .",
    "figure 10 contrasts the results from the original spectra with those from the smoothed versions . in each case",
    "we plot the autocorrelation functions computed from single sightlines and overplot the peak of the corresponding crosscorrelation at a velocity lag equal to the transverse velocity separation between the lines of sight ( @xmath96 km  s@xmath15  for q1422/q1422 , @xmath97 km  s@xmath15  for q1439a / b for the case of @xmath98= 0.3 , @xmath99= 0.7 , and @xmath100 km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 ) .",
    "the differences shown in figure 10 between the esi and low - resolution cases suggest a significant dependence on spectral resolution . at esi resolution",
    "the concordance between auto- and crosscorrelations appears to be very good for both pairs of sightlines .",
    "however , at low resolution the peaks of the crosscorrelation functions fall well below the values of the autocorrelation functions at the same total velocity separation . while part of this effect may be due to noise in the correlations , the general dependence on resolution can be understood in regions where the intrinsic correlation function is non - linear on scales smaller than the width of the smoothing kernel .",
    "( this includes the region around the peak at zero lag , since the correlation is expected to be symmetric about @xmath93 . )",
    "convolving the input spectra with a smoothing kernel produces a correlation function that has been convolved twice with the same kernel , once for each spectrum .",
    "the resulting unnormalized autocorrelation function may therefore be higher or lower at a particular velocity lag , depending on the shape of the correlation function at that point .",
    "however , since the peak of the crosscorrelation function is already a maximum it can only decrease as a result of smoothing ( apart from the effects of noise ) .",
    "thus , if we adjust our cosmology such that , at high spectral resolution , the composite crosscorrelation function built up from pairs at many different separations agrees with the mean autocorrelation function ( ignoring redshift - space distortions ) , then this agreement may not hold when using low - resolution data .",
    "spectral resolution must therefore be considered carefully when performing this type of comparison , for example by referring to artificial spectra drawn from numerical simulations of large - scale structure .",
    "we have analyzed the transverse properties of the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath101 on scales of @xmath102 @xmath6  comoving mpc ( @xmath5 @xmath6  proper kpc ) toward the @xmath103 quasar pair q1422 + 2309a / q1424 + 2255 and the @xmath104 pair q1439 - 0034a / b .",
    "strong peaks at zero velocity lag in the flux crosscorrelations between paired sightlines indicate coherence in the h  i  absorbers on these scales .",
    "the crowded nature of the ly@xmath3  forest at these redshifts restricts a line - by - line comparison .",
    "however , a statistical approach suggests that the flux in paired spectra tends to be most similar in regions of either very strong or very weak absorption .",
    "the similarities at flux levels near the continuum are consistent with the large sizes of voids and low - density gaseous filaments and sheets expected to comprise much of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the more surprising similarities at low flux levels may simply reflect the limited dynamic range of transmitted flux in distinguishing among regions of high optical depth ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "larger differences in flux found at intermediate flux levels may relate to the increased scatter in flux naturally expected for optical depths near unity , and also to the fact that flux differences along the wings of strong lines will be sensitive to bulk velocity shifts between sightlines . despite the difficulty in producing a clear physical interpretation from the data alone",
    ", both the correlation and flux statistics should provide a useful resource for comparison with numerical simulations .    in order to assess the dependence of the correlation functions on photon noise and spectral resolution we have employed high - quality esi and hires spectra of q1422 .",
    "adding photon noise has very little effect for s / n @xmath7 per resolution element except to introduce a spike in the autocorrelation at zero lag . increasing the resolution fwhm increases the velocity width of the autocorrelation and decreases its amplitude , as expected .",
    "these effects may occur unevenly , however , due to the incorporation of noise features as the peak broadens .",
    "we further tested the effects of resolution on the relative amplitudes of the autocorrelation and crosscorrelation by degrading the resolution of our esi spectra to match that of a low - resolution spectrograph such as keck / lris or vlt / fors2 .",
    "for both pairs , the crosscorrelation and autocorrelations agree well for our adopted cosmology when the correlations are computed from the original esi data .",
    "however , smoothing the spectra substantially reduces the crosscorrelation with respect to the autocorrelations .",
    "this will typically occur at any velocity lag where the intrinsic correlation function is non - linear on scales smaller than the width of the smoothing kernel .",
    "cosmological tests making use of the ly@xmath3  forest correlation length should take this effect into account .    finally , we present an inventory of metal lines in q1424 , q1439a , and q1439b in the appendix .",
    "the most noteworthy features are a pair of strong c  iv  complexes at @xmath8 appearing only toward q1439b . given their large equivalent widths",
    ", the relatively small separation between these systems suggests that they are related , possibly arising from separate galaxy halos or two sides of a galactic outflow .",
    "low - ionization systems containing mg  ii  and fe  ii  appear at @xmath9 in q1439 a and b separated by 410 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "these may either represent a single , extended structure ( @xmath106 @xmath6  proper kpc ) or separate , clustered absorbers .",
    "a c  iv  system appears toward q1424 at @xmath107 , within 440 km  s@xmath15  of a known c  iv  system toward q1422 . a single absorber responsible for both systems would have a transverse size @xmath108 @xmath6  proper kpc .",
    "however , the number density of weak c  iv  systems at this redshift suggests that these lines may instead result from chance superposition .",

    "previous studies using quasar pairs and multiply - imaged lensed quasars have demonstrated spatial coherence in metal systems over a variety of length scales .",
    "differences between metal systems in narrowly - separated lines of sight suggest that the absorbers giving rise to individual lines seen in high - resolution spectra span at most a few kiloparsecs , both for high - ionization systems seen in c  iv  and for low - ionization systems seen in mg  ii  @xcite . however , these absorbers may be part of larger structures extending @xmath109 @xmath6  kpc @xcite and even @xmath110 @xmath6  kpc for highly ionized material @xcite .",
    "the present data afford us a unique opportunity to probe the coherence of metal systems on scales of @xmath111 @xmath6  proper kpc .",
    "unfortunately , modest signal - to - noise and significant contamination from skylines in the red part of our spectra greatly limit our sensitivity and hinder completeness estimates .",
    "our detections are limited to relatively strong lines and lines that fall in regions of unusually high s / n .",
    "line lists for q1424 , q1439a , and q1439b are presented in tables 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively . in the following sections we briefly comment on some of the more interesting systems .",
    "results for q1422 are presented in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for each line we measure the wavelength centroid and equivalent width .",
    "weighted mean redshifts are given where multiple lines are measured for a single ion . in the case of blended lines we attempt to alleviate the overlap by fitting voigt profiles to any unblended transitions of the same ions using vpfit and then dividing by the inferred model profiles .",
    "this typically allows us to obtain values for at least the strongest blended components .",
    "strong associated broad absorption lines ( bals ) at @xmath112 are seen in c  iv  and n  v  along with weaker associated absorption in si  iv  ( although the si  iv  appears affected by skyline contamination ) .",
    "isolated components of c  iv  and n  v  appear up to 1000 km  s@xmath15  blueward of the bal .",
    "these suggest small pockets of outflowing material moving at a higher velocity than the material responsible for the bulk of the broad absorption .",
    "c  iv  is also seen at @xmath112 toward q1422a .",
    "@xcite . however , since the absorption is associated with the quasar in both cases , these features are unlikely to be related .",
    "an intervening c  iv  system appears at @xmath113 .",
    "we additionally identify the line at 5692.3   to be si  iv  @xmath431394 at the same redshift , where si  iv  @xmath431403 is blended with n  v  @xmath431239 at @xmath114",
    ". a c  iv  complex with possible si  iv  appears at @xmath115 toward both the a and c images of q1422 @xcite , implying a transverse size @xmath108 @xmath6  proper kpc for a single structure spanning all three lines of sight .",
    "figure 11 shows the c  iv  absorption at this redshift in q1424 and q1422 .",
    "the systems are narrowly separated along the line of sight , with @xmath116 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "however , @xcite find @xmath117 c  iv  systems per unit redshift at @xmath118 for systems with total column density @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "this translates to a typical spacing between systems of only @xmath121 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to suspect that this superposition of relatively modest c  iv  absorbers toward q1422 and q1424 occurs by chance .",
    "significant h  i  absorption occurs along both lines of sight in the velocity interval spanned by these systems , though this may be due to the crowded state of the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath122 .",
    "two broad c  iv  complexes at @xmath8 form the most conspicuous metal absorption features in the spectrum of q1439b ( figure 12 ) .",
    "the systems are separated by 1700 km  s@xmath15 , and each has a velocity width of @xmath47 km  s@xmath15 . neither complex is observed toward q1439a .",
    "the individual components are unlikely to be resolved with esi .",
    "however , we can place a lower limit on the column density of these systems by assuming that the weaker transition ( c  iv  @xmath431551 ) falls on the linear part of the curve - of - growth . in that case",
    ", the column density , @xmath123 , is related to rest equivalent with , @xmath124 , as @xmath125 for a transition with rest wavelength @xmath126 and oscillator strength @xmath127 . for the lower - equivalent width system ( @xmath128 , @xmath129  ) , this gives @xmath130 @xmath120 .",
    "if we adopt a power - law column density distribution @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the number of systems , then we would expect @xmath133 systems per unit redshift in this column density range based on the above boksenberg et al.(2003 ) results and adopting their value of @xmath134 .",
    "the narrow redshift spacing of these two systems ( @xmath135 ) therefore strongly suggests that they are related .",
    "one explanation is that the absorption complexes arise from two sides of an intervening galactic outflow .",
    "alternatively , the high levels of h  i  absorption seen at both c  iv  redshifts may indicate a pair of galaxy halos .",
    "mg  ii  + fe  ii  systems appear toward both q1439 a and b at @xmath9 , separated between spectra by 410 km  s@xmath15  along the line of sight ( figure 13 ) . from @xcite ,",
    "the number of mg  ii  systems per unit redshift with rest equivalent width @xmath136   is expected to be @xmath137 .",
    "the probability of randomly finding a system within this velocity separation is therefore @xmath138 , or a factor of three lower if we restrict ourselves to strong ( @xmath139 ) systems @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a high likelihood that these systems are related .",
    "both mg  ii  and fe  ii  appear stronger toward b than toward a , with a factor of seven difference between sightlines in the equivalent widths of mg  ii  @xmath432804 and fe  ii  @xmath432384 .",
    "these features may arise either from a single absorber spanning the 280 @xmath6  proper kpc between sightlines or from a pair of clustered objects .",
    "two additional strong mg  ii  systems appear along only a single sightline , one toward a at @xmath140 and another toward b at @xmath141 .",
    "q1439b is a bal quasar showing high levels of associated absorption in c  iv  and n  v. we identify the o  i  absorption reported by @xcite as the strong c  iv  systems at @xmath8 mentioned above .",
    "no strong associated absorption is seen for q1439a . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the difference in associated absorption features supports the hypothesis that q1439 a and b are a true binary and not a lensed pair .",
