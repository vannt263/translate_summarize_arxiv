    "the remarkable supernova in the large magellanic cloud has enabled detailed studies of many fields in astrophysics , from massive star evolution to the sn explosion mechanism to the earliest stage of supernova remnants ( snrs ; see reviews in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as well as being the brightest sn over the past 400yr , sn 1987a was a highly unusual event .",
    "in particular , the progenitor was surrounded by a peculiar triple - ring nebula @xcite , which could have resulted from a binary merger of the progenitor 20000yr prior to the explosion @xcite . over the past decade",
    ", the remnant has undergone a major evolution since the shock collision with the inner equatorial ring , resulting in rapid brightening of the radio and soft x - ray emission ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we employed two models in this study : a 3d torus as developed by and a two - dimensional ( 2d ) thin elliptical ring .",
    "the torus model is illustrated in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "it is a truncated shell with eight fitting parameters : flux density , center position ( right ascension and declination ) , radius , half - opening angle ( @xmath520 ) , thickness ( as a fraction of the radius ) , slope ( in % ) and direction ( @xmath521 ) of a linear gradient in the surface emissivity .",

    "* ) . to avoid complications , we determined the confidence intervals from the covariance matrices .",
    "there are a few cases for which this method fails to give sensible results because the best - fit parameters are near the boundaries .",
    "we then estimated the confidence intervals by plotting out the @xmath522 distribution .",
    "in addition to the torus model , an elliptical ring model was also employed to compare with that used in x - ray studies @xcite . as in the torus model",
    ", we included a linear gradient in the surface emissivity to account for the observed east - west asymmetry .",
    "the ring model has seven fitting parameters : flux density , center position , semi - major axis ( @xmath523 ) , semi - minor axis ( @xmath524 ) , and degree and direction of the gradient .",
    "the model is illustrated in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "since the system is known have an inclination of @xmath545  to the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we first tried fitting with the ring s aspect ratio fixed at @xmath525 , but found that it gives slightly worse statistics than the torus fits .",

    "same as the torus fits , confidence intervals of the best - fit parameters were determined from the covariance matrix .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are listed in tables  [ table : torus ] and [ table : ring ] . as an example",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig : model_img ] images of the best - fit torus and ring models compared with the actual radio map taken on 2012 september 1 , and the maps of the residual ( i.e.  data minus model ) visibilities . the models have successfully captured the characteristic structure of the remnant .",
    "with one extra fitting parameter , the torus model provides slightly better fits to the data than the ring model .",
    "however , we can not determine whether the difference in statistics is significant , since the standard @xmath526-test does not apply here .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : model_img ] , the ring model underpredicts the flux density at the remnant center , but provides a better fit to the northern rim than the torus model .    time evolution of the best - fit flux density , radius , opening angle , and degree of asymmetry , which is obtained from the slope of the gradient , are plotted in figure  [ fig : fit ] .",
    "the torus radius increased linearly at the early epochs until a clear break at day @xmath57000 .",
    "after that , the expansion rate was significantly reduced .",
    "it is intriguing that around the same time when the break occurred , both @xmath520 and the asymmetry began to decrease . since day @xmath57500 the model flux density increases at a lower rate than the exponential fit given by @xcite .",
    "for the other parameters not shown in the figure , the torus thickness is not well determined from the fits . as reported by , this is likely smaller than the resolution of the 9ghz observations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the direction of the linear gradient , which identifies the asymmetry of the surface brightness , remains mostly constant over the epochs .    for the ring model fit ,",
    "it is clear from figure  ( [ fig : fit]b ) that @xmath523 is always smaller than the torus radius .",
    "when compared to the x - ray radius reported by @xcite , @xmath523 has a similar size between days 6000 and 7500 , and it is larger after day 7500 . over time , @xmath523 increases linearly without obvious deceleration .",
    "in contrast , @xmath524 exhibits a break around day 7000 , as did the torus radius .",
    "this results in a decrease in the ratio @xmath527 , which shows a remarkably similar trend to that of @xmath520 ( figure  ( [ fig : fit]c ) ) .",
    "the ring and torus fits give nearly identical flux densities , and both suggest a decreasing trend in the degree of asymmetry since day @xmath57500 . for completeness , we also show in figure  [ fig : ringfix ] the best - fit @xmath523 and @xmath524 from the ring fitting with a fixed aspect ratio .",

    "the torus fitting results shown in figure  ( [ fig : fit]b ) suggest a possible deceleration of the remnant .",
    "we therefore followed @xcite to fit the radius evolution with a broken - linear function . only observations after day 4200 were used here , since we are most interested in the late evolution of the remnant .",
    "we note that the radius measurements in table  [ table : torus ] have statistical uncertainties of the order of 0001 , much smaller than the scatter from measurement to measurement .",
    "we therefore added in quadrature systematic uncertainties of 0005 to the measurements errors .",
    "this value was chosen to give a reduced @xmath522 value of about 1 for the broken - linear fit .",
    "we have tried different values from 0 to 005 and confirm that our results are independent of the choice .",
    "table  [ table : expand ] lists the best - fit expansion velocity and transition day .",
    "uncertainties quoted are 68% confidence intervals determined using a bootstrapping technique @xcite with 10000 simulations .",
    "the break in the expansion of the torus model occurred on day @xmath539 , and was the same as @xmath524 of the ring model ( day @xmath531 ) .",
    "however , @xmath523 shows no breaks and a simple linear fit is statistically preferred .",
    "finally , the ring fit with a constant aspect ratio suggests a somewhat later transition at day @xmath534 . at a source distance of 51.4kpc @xcite ,",
    "the torus fits suggest expansion velocities of @xmath540kms@xmath1  and @xmath541kms@xmath1  before and after the break , respectively . while @xmath542 is larger than the expansion rate @xmath3kms@xmath1  of @xmath523 , both values are consistent with the result of @xmath543kms@xmath1  reported by .",
    "similar to the torus radius , the expansion velocity of @xmath524 decreased by nearly 50% , from 3300kms@xmath1  to 1750kms@xmath1 , after the break .",
    "non - thermal radio emission from snrs traces the particle acceleration in shocks .",
    "theories suggest that the emission is generally distributed between the forward and reverse shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the shocks of sn 1987a travel outward and encounter the equatorial ring , we expect the radio - emitting region to have a complex structure in 3d ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with components from both high - latitude material above the equatorial plane and the ring itself . to characterize the remnant geometry ,",
    "we have carried out fourier modeling using a truncated - shell torus model and an elliptical thin ring model .",
    "while both provide adequate fits to the data , we should note that these models are simple parameterizations of the remnant structure , and that the geometry inferred from the fitting is model - dependent and could be systematically biased .",
    "for instance , if the actual shape of the emission resembles a crescent torus @xcite , then the radius measurement obtained from our torus model would depend sensitively on @xmath520 .",
    "one major discrepancy between the torus and ring models is the radius measurement .",
    "we find that the radius obtained from fitting a torus model is always larger than that from a ring model .",
    "this could be a projection effect due to differences in the model geometry , or the emission at high latitudes , to which the torus model is more sensitive , being physically further away from the center .",
    "for the former , consider a thin spherical shell in 3d : in the image the emission would appear to peak inside the shell radius because of projection and the finite spatial resolution of the telescope .",
    "hence , a 3d shell model would require a larger radius compared to a simple thin ring model .",
    "our torus model varies between a shell and a ring depending on @xmath520 ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the projection effect is minimum at @xmath544 , where the torus reduces to a 2d ring , and increases with @xmath520 . given that the best - fit @xmath520 is significantly greater than zero , the above discrepancy is not unexpected .",
    "alternatively , the radio - emitting region could have a larger radius at higher latitudes than at the equatorial plane , because the sn shock travels at a larger velocity in the low - density environment @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , any 3d models sensitive to high latitude emission , such as the torus model , will tend to give a larger radius .",
    "it is worth noting that in both scenarios above , there is a possible coupling between the torus radius and @xmath520 , and it could correspondingly impact the expansion measurement .    in previous studies ,",
    "the reported radii of snr 1987a in radio and x - rays show a 10% difference over day 50008000 (; @xcite ) .",
    "it was first pointed out by @xcite that the discrepancy may not be physical , but due to different measuring techniques .",
    "this idea is similar to what we have discussed above . in particular ,",
    "measurements from were made with a torus model , while the x - ray results were obtained from ring fitting @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed both radio and x - ray data taken in 2004 ( day @xmath56300 ) using a consistent method and showed that the snr sizes agree to within 1% .",
    "our results confirm their finding : @xmath523 from the ring model at this epoch is fully consistent with the x - ray radius reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  ( [ fig : fit]b ) ) .",
    "more generally , the ring fits allow a meaningful comparison between the radio and x - ray snr radii . from figure  ( [ fig : fit]b ) , the radius of the radio remnant has exceeded that of the x - ray counterpart since day @xmath57500 .",
    "this is also supported by the torus fits : @xcite employed the same torus model as ours to fit the x - ray data taken on 2008 april ( day 7736 ) , and found that it provides a slightly better fit than a simple ring , with a radius of @xmath545 and @xmath546 .",
    "both values are smaller than what we have obtained for the radio remnant at the same epoch ( 089  and 362 , respectively ; table  [ table : torus ] ) , suggesting a smaller extent of the remnant in x - rays than in radio .",
    "this agrees with the simulation results @xcite .",
    "in addition , the radio emission may partly originate from fast shocks at high latitudes that have not yet decelerated .",
    "this scenario can help explain the fact that the radio remnant has apparently expanded beyond the optical inner ring with radius @xmath547 @xcite .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : fit]c ) shows that @xmath520 started to decrease at day @xmath57000 , as did the ratio @xmath527 of the ring model .",
    "the results suggest that the radio emission from lower latitudes has gradually dominated , which could be a consequence of shock interaction with the dense circumstellar medium in the equatorial ring .",
    "if the contribution of radio emission from high latitudes continues to diminish , then we would expect the radius estimates from both the torus and ring models to converge eventually .",
    "the morphological evolution of snr 1987a was accompanied by a reduction in the degree of surface brightness asymmetry .",
    "since the radio remnant first emerged , the eastern lobe has always been brighter than the western one ( see figure  [ fig : super ] ) , and this has been attributed to faster shocks in the east ( e.g. , @xcite ; ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the significantly higher expansion velocities of the eastern lobe measured from radio observations at higher frequencies @xcite , and by the higher shock temperature found in the east from x - ray studies @xcite . the faster shock in the east",
    "is expected to encounter the equatorial ring , slow down and exit the ring earlier than in the west .",
    "this would reduce the radio emissivity in the eastern rim and hence the overall brightness asymmetry .",
    "if the observed trend continues , the western hemisphere of the radio remnant may become brighter than the eastern hemisphere in a few years , as predicted by 3d simulations of the expanding remnant ( t. m. potter et al.2013 in preparation ) .",
    "the same picture could also be applied to the x - ray emission , which exhibits similar variations in the projected brightness distribution @xcite .    in x - rays , @xcite reported drastic deceleration of the snr from 8500kms@xmath1  to 1820kms@xmath1  on day @xmath55900 .",
    "however , we do not find conclusive evidence for a similar deceleration in the radio emission .",
    "in particular , @xmath523 from the ring fit shows a constant expansion at 3890kms@xmath1 . for the torus fit , while figure  ( [ fig : fit]b ) suggests a break in the expansion , the coupling between the radius and @xmath520 described above makes the interpretation difficult .",
    "if the apparent break is physical , it would well match the deceleration of the reverse shock predicted by one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ( see figure  9 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , we believe that the break is likely caused by the decreasing trend in @xmath520 . hence , it reflects a change of the emission geometry rather than the slowing down of the shock . observing a deceleration of @xmath523 in future",
    "will confirm this picture .",
    "this also gives a prediction that once @xmath520 stops shrinking , the torus radius expansion rate should return to the same value as that measured for @xmath523 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the radio remnant of sn 1987a using atca 9ghz imaging observations taken between 1992 and 2013 , and have carried out fourier modeling on the visibility data to quantitatively measure the remnant structure . a truncated - shell torus model and an elliptical ring model were used to fit the remnant morphology .",
    "they both suggest a gradual decrease in the latitude extent of the remnant starting from day @xmath57000 , implying that the radio emission from the equatorial region has progressively dominated . this has been accompanied by a decreasing trend in the brightness asymmetry in the east - west direction . together",
    "these could indicate a new stage of the remnant evolution , such that the forward shock has fully engulfed the entire inner ring and is now interacting with the densest part of the circumstellar medium .    as a direct comparison between the torus and ring model fits , they give similar results for most parameters , but the former always suggests a larger radius .",
    "the discrepancy could be attributed to the projection effect or emission at high latitudes to which the torus model is more sensitive .",
    "this also leads to different expansion measurements .",
    "while the torus fit shows a break in the expansion around day 7000 with the velocity slowing down from 4600kms@xmath1  to 2400kms@xmath1 , the ring fit indicates a constant expansion rate of 3890kms@xmath1 .",
    "we argue that the apparent break could be the result of coupling between the torus radius and opening angle .",
    "we expect in the future when the latter stays constant , both the torus and ring fits should give consistent expansion velocity .",
    "further observations at higher resolution ( with vlbi or alma for example ) would be useful in understanding the true 3d nature of the evolving remnant , and the time and latitude dependence of the expansion velocity .",
