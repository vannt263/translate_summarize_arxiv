    "the external flux induces a persistent current of cooper pairs in superconducting loop .",
    "when the self inductance of the superconducting loop and the josephson coupling energy are large , the total flux , sum of the external flux and induced flux , become quantized , while the fluxoid quantization condition is always satisfied .",
    "considering the energy of cooper pairs , the effective potential of the system shows a new periodic structure consisting of cusp and smooth barriers . in one extreme ,",
    "the tunneling through smooth - barrier potential is dominant , which is the usual case @xcite , while , in the other extreme , the cusp barrier potential is more appropriate in tunneling phenomena .",

    "a current - biased qubit of dc squid type with large josephson junctions can be described by the present theory for low value of @xmath67 .",
    "the quantum phase slip may be relevant in a thin superconducting loop when the energy levels are degenerate @xcite .",
    "the phase slip process causes the change of tunneling frequency and , thus , induces the decoherence . for the lower value of @xmath67 in eq .",
