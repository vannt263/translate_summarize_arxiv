    "mond , which posits a departure from standard dynamics as an alternative to dark matter , has been amply tested in disk galaxies of all types ( for a recent review of mond , see e.g. , ref .",
    "these forceful tests have been made possible by the presence of neutral gas , in ordered , quasi - circular , rather well - understood motion , observed to large radii .",
    "rotation - curve analysis remains the flagship of mond testing .",
    "testing mond in individual elliptical galaxies is far less advanced . in most ellipticals",
    "our only means of probing the gravitational field is the study of their stellar dynamics .",
    "but , this probe suffers serious uncertainties due to our ignorance of the stellar motions ( the orbits of stars are not circular and can be anisotropic , with unknown dependence on radius ) .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite find from the stellar kinematics of ngc 7507 , some tension with the predictions of mond , but they studied only a rather limited set of orbit distributions .",
    "in contrast , sanders ( 2012 , shown in fig .",
    "37 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) found it easy to get a very good match of the same data with the mond predictions , for other orbit distributions .",
    "furthermore , this method allows us to probe the field only to relatively small radii , i.e. , within the stellar component .",
    "but ellipticals have , by and large , high mean surface densities . expressed as accelerations , these correspond to mean accelerations of the order of @xmath6 or higher , within the bulk of the stellar component .",
    "mond then predicts that only very modest mass discrepancies should be found within these regions .",
    "( the term `` mass discrepancy '' refers to the ratio of the mass deduced by dynamical means , assuming newtonian dynamics  the dynamical mass  and the mass detected directly  the baryonic mass . )",
    "this prediction is indeed born out by the observations .",
    "but it means that we can not expect to test mond , using stellar dynamics , in the more interesting regime of low accelerations and large predicted mass discrepancies .",
    "analysis using strong lensing of quasars avoids the first shortcoming but not the second .",
    "the `` coincidence '' @xmath7 @xcite ( @xmath8 is the hubble distance ) implies that strong lensing can not occur in the low - acceleration regime for a low - redshift elliptical and a source at cosmological distances .",
    "so , only very mild mass discrepancies are predicted by mond to appear in such studies .",
    "also , these studies produce only one , bulk value for the mass discrepancy , not a run with radius .",
    "this leaves the interpretation of such analyses at the mercy of knowing accurately the stellar mass - to - light ratios of the elliptical in question .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that one finds different groups reaching different conclusions using even the same data . for example ,",
    "@xcite claim meaningful ( albeit small ) tension between the strong - lensing , mond masses , and the stellar masses they deduce in the central , high - acceleration regions of several ellipticals , while ref .",
    "@xcite claim success for the mond predictions applying the same technique to a larger sample , including that of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite , who reached similar conclusions as ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in a rare case , the presence of a rotating gas ring around the elliptical ngc 2974 permitted @xcite to test mond up to a radius of about @xmath9 , using the ring s rotation curve .",
    "they find good agreement with the predictions of mond for the interpolating function @xmath10 ( see below ) .",
    "but , again , only small mass discrepancies appear within the region that is probed .    using more luminous test objects , such as planetary nebulae , or globular clusters",
    ", one can probe individual ellipticals to somewhat larger radii .",
    "a notable example is the mond analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , of data by ref .",
    "@xcite on planetary nebulae in three ellipticals , reaching 3 - 5 effective radii .",
    "but these still do not reach very far , where large discrepancies develop , and the method still greatly suffers from large uncertainties due to ignorance of the orbit distribution .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite used the globular - cluster system of ngc 4636 to probe for dark - matter and mond .",
    "they find consistency with the mond predictions , but that no strong statement can be made since the accelerations probed are not low enough .    in some ellipticals we can observe x - ray emitting hot gas to relatively large radii . but",
    "these tend to be in clusters or groups , and , in particular , to be the central galaxy of the cluster .",
    "the mass discrepancies such analyses reveal might then be related to those of the cluster at large .    in light of all this ,",
    "the recent advent of two studies of isolated ellipticals , probing their dynamics to large radii , is most welcome .",
    "the dynamics of ngc 720 @xcite and ngc 1521 @xcite were studied assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in their x - ray emitting gas envelops .",
    "the gravitational field was probed to a little under @xmath11 for the former , and a little under @xmath12 for the latter . from the deprojected x - ray temperature and density runs",
    ", @xcite deduced the spherically averaged runs of dynamical mass , @xmath13 , which is equivalent , conceptually , to measuring the rotation curve , @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] , or the acceleration field @xmath15 .",
    "the accelerations measured , @xmath16 , span a range from more than @xmath2 near the center to about @xmath3 at the outer radii . in this regard",
    ", they are as probing as the best of rotation - curves . and , while this method brings its own systematics ( discussed extensively by refs . @xcite",
    "unaccounted for departures from hydrostatic equilibrium : bulk motion of the gas  such as infall , rotation , and turbulence ; uncertainties introduced by having to deproject the gas and stellar distributions , etc . )",
    "they afford , like rotation - curves , analysis free of our ignorance of the test - particles orbits .",
    "so , all in all , they permit us , for the first time , as far as i am aware , to test mond in individual ellipticals , with almost the same effectiveness as in rotation - curve analysis.@xmath17    here i compare the derived runs of @xmath18 with the detailed mond predictions for these runs , based on only the observed baryon distribution ( for reasonable stellar @xmath19 values ) .",
    "the analysis and results are described in section [ analysis ] , and discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the dynamical analysis of refs . @xcite approximates the systems as spherical , and so will mine . for a spherical system ,",
    "all existing formulations of mond as modified gravity predict the relation between the measured acceleration , @xmath16 , and the newtonian acceleration produced by the baryons , @xmath20 : = ( g/)g . here",
    "@xmath21 is the mond interpolating function , appearing , e.g. , in the modified poisson theory of ref .",
    "its asymptotic behaviors are @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "we can also write g=(/ ) , @xmath24 is the interpolating function appearing , more directly , in qumond @xcite .",
    "the two theories are equivalent for spherical systems if the two interpolating functions are related by @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the dynamical mass enclosed within radius @xmath26 is @xmath27 , while @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the enclosed baryonic mass .",
    "those mond formulations ( and the relativistic theories that reduce to them in the nonrelativistic limit ) thus predict that in isolated spherical systems , @xmath13 and @xmath29 are related by m_d(r)=m_b(r ) .    in figures",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , i reproduce from @xcite , the runs of @xmath30 , the enclosed stellar mass , @xmath31 , the modeled gas mass , and @xmath13 deduced for ngc 1521 and ngc 720 , respectively .",
    "the stellar contribution is for a spherically averaged triaxial model of the deprojected light distribution .",
    "the conversion to stellar - mass runs assumes their best - fit values of the stellar mass - to - light ratios , which they get from a multi - component fit to @xmath13 ( stars + gas + a dark - matter halo ) : the @xmath32-band ratio @xmath33 for ngc 1521 ( with an adopted distance of 62.1 ) , and the @xmath34-band ratio @xmath35 for ngc 720 ( adopted distance of 25.7 ) . for @xmath13 ,",
    "@xcite give two alternative runs : one derived from a model of the x - ray temperature and density profiles ( extrapolated beyond the measured region ) .",
    "the other run of deduced @xmath18 they describe as based on `` a more traditional ` smoothed inversion ' approach '' .",
    "the mond predictions of @xmath13 , from eq.([iv ] ) , are shown in the figures , as points , for several values of @xmath26 , calculated using @xmath36 .",
    "i take @xmath37 ( see ref .",
    "the interpolating function i use is @xmath38 , for which @xmath39 , which was shown in many previous studies @xcite to perform well in the range of x values i cover here .",
    "the fact that @xmath40 is not compatible with solar system constraints for very large @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is of no concern here , since i use this form only up to @xmath43 ( as in all the above references ) . for example , using , instead , @xmath44 ( from the families defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is used all along in ref . @xcite for mond rotation curve predictions , would have given the same results here : despite their different analytic form , @xmath45 and @xmath40 are everywhere equal to better than 4.5% , while @xmath45 has the added advantage that it approaches @xmath46 fast at high @xmath41 ; so , unlike @xmath47 , is consistent with solar system constraints . and",
    "a few tens @xmath4 . ]",
    "the mond predictions shown in fig.[fig1 ] use the same @xmath48 value as adopted by ref .",
    "we see that in this case , the mond predictions agree very well with @xmath13 deduced by ref .",
    "for ngc 720 , the best fit @xmath35 found by ref .",
    "@xcite gives a mond - predicted @xmath13 that is somewhat lower than the deduced run . with the system parameters adopted by ref .",
    "@xcite , mond prefers a higher value of @xmath49 . without attempting a best - fit procedure ( which would not be more informative , anyway )",
    "i also show in fig.[fig2 ] the mond predictions for @xmath50 . for this value",
    "the agreement is good  as good as that between the two alternative runs of @xmath18 presented by ref .",
    ". this higher value of @xmath49 is also in much better agreement with values found in earlier , rotation - curve analyses ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and fig .",
    "28 of ref .",

    "( with results from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for two sets of mond predictions : one for the same @xmath35 preferred by the newtonian analysis of ref . @xcite ( small rings ) ; the other for @xmath50 , which mond prefers ( filled squares ) . in the latter case",
    "the curve for @xmath51 should be raised by a factor 1.5 . ]",
    "to better appreciate the import of the results , it is helpful to break the full curve comparison into the several salient mond sub - predictions : ( i ) in the inner regions , @xmath52 , the measured accelerations are rather larger than @xmath6 [ @xmath53 in ngc 1521 , and ngc 720 , respectively , and higher for smaller @xmath26 ] ; so , mond predicts only a small mass discrepancy there : it predicts that with a reasonable @xmath55 value the runs of @xmath18 and @xmath56 can be made approximately equal in this region ; which is indeed the case .",
    "( ii ) mond predicts that , with the preferred @xmath55 value , the mass discrepancy should set in where @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , this is where the discrepancy becomes @xmath58 .",
    "( iii ) with the same @xmath55 value , mond predicts correctly the run of the mass discrepancy at large radii , where the accelerations become much smaller than @xmath6 ; the predicted discrepancy is @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath6 appears in ( ii ) and ( iii ) in different and independent roles ; the fact that the same value matches both is nontrivial .    the two ellipticals considered here differ greatly from the extensively studied disk galaxies , in structure , composition ( relative contributions of stars , neutral - gas , and hot - gas ) , and formation history .",
    "also , their fields were probed by a different method to that of disk galaxies .",
    "hence , the significance of the above results for the mond - dark - matter controversy goes far beyond the mere evidence that two more galaxies conform with the predictions of mond .",
    "in particular , in the context of the dark - matter paradigm it is all the more unexpected that the relation between baryons and dark matter , found here for the two ellipticals , is described so accurately by the same formula that accounts for disc - galaxy dynamics .    with all the successes of mond in accounting for the dynamics of galaxies of all types without dark matter",
    ", we should remember that mond does not explain away completely the mass discrepancy in galaxy clusters , where even in mond some amount of yet undetected matter is required ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . finding this extra mass , or modifying mond to account for the remaining discrepancy , is a standing challenge for mond .",
    "the finer details of the comparison of the mond predictions with the deduced @xmath18 runs may be subject to remaining uncertainties ( in the distances , the exact value of @xmath6 , systematics , etc . ) .",
    "i want to discuss , specifically , the inner regions of ngc 720 , where , with the @xmath19 value preferred by mond , the mond prediction is somewhat above the dynamical masses deduced by ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the newtonian fitting procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , the best - fit @xmath55 value is constrained , as they explain , mainly by their deduced @xmath18 profile in the inner several @xmath4 . at large radii ,",
    "@xmath18 is dominated by the dark - matter halo , which comes with its own adjustable parameters .",
    "but , it is just these inner regions where the x - ray - deduced @xmath18 is most susceptible to various systematics ( as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", it is there that departures from the assumed hydrostatic equilibrium ( such as rotation of the gas , turbulence , infall , etc . )",
    "are most likely . in this connection , the extensive study of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a large sample of x - ray ellipticals , is most revealing .",
    "they find that in the inner parts of ellipticals , where the field is dominated by the stellar mass component , there is , generally , little correlation between the optical and x - ray morphologies .",
    "they conclude that , as a rule , `` the gas is at least so far out of equilibrium that it does not retain any information about the shape of the potential , and that x - ray - derived radial mass profiles may be in error by factors of order unity . ''",
    "this view is strengthened by the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the recent @xcite .    in contradistinction , in mond , @xmath55 is the only `` free '' parameter that characterizes the mass distribution . in the whole region analyzed here ,",
    "the gas mass is subdominant ; so , in mond , @xmath55 is constrained by the whole region of study .",
    "so , arguably , more weight should be given to the performance of mond in the regions beyond several @xmath4 , and the tension in the very inner regions of ngc 720 could be easily attributed to departures from equilibrium , as found to be ubiquitous by ref .",
    "so the mond @xmath55 value appears more reliable than the value determined by ref .",
    "@xcite , which is 33 percent lower .",
    "in fact , if we permit ourselves even a larger discrepancy in the inner few @xmath4 , allowing us an even larger @xmath55 value , based on the inadequacy of the x - ray mass determination in the inner region , the agreement of the mond predictions with the measure @xmath18 can be improved in the outer regions .",
    "ngc 1521 seems to avoid this tension in the inner regions , even assuming full equilibrium .",
    "the accuracy of the mond predictions of the x - ray - deduced fields , over the large range beyond a few @xmath4 in ngc 720 , and over the whole range in ngc 1521 , may be taken as evidence that , by and large , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is not strongly amiss there .",
    "otherwise it would require too much of a conspiracy for mond to correctly predict fictitious @xmath18 runs .",
    "interestingly , x - ray observations of the inner regions of ngc 720 were claimed , in the past , to evince tension with mond : it was claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on rosat data , that their x - ray isophote ellipticities were too large to be compatible with the mond field of the stellar component alone .",
    "later , it became evident that these pronounced ellipticities were largely an artifact of point source contamination .",
    "cleaner chandra data @xcite showed rather smaller x - ray ellipticities .",
    "@xcite still maintained that even the remaining ellipticiies ( within @xmath60 ) , and the degree of misalignment they show with respect to the optical isophotes evince the presence of a dark matter halo , and  without actually giving any calculation in mond - that a theory like mond can not account for these .",
    "i think that this should be of little concern for mond in light of the finding of ref .",
    "the case for concluding so is even strengthened by what i find in this paper .",
