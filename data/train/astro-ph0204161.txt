    "clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized systems in the universe and are used as probes for the properties of the cosmic large - scale structure .",
    "they arise from high peaks of the primordial density field and during gravitational collapse they collect material over a scale of about 10 mpc .",
    "their typical size is of about 1 mpc and their mass ranges from @xmath1 ( the group edge ) to @xmath2 ( rich clusters ) .",
    "about 10 - 15@xmath0 of their total mass is in the form of diffuse hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium within the cluster potential well at a temperature of about 1 - 10 kev .",
    "observations show that the intra - cluster gas has a mean iron abundance of one third of the solar value ( renzini 1997 ; white 2000 ) , with no evidence for evolution out to @xmath3 ( matsumoto et al .",
    "this fact suggests that the cluster galaxies must have lost their nuclear processed gas into the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) . in recent years",
    ", measurements of the abundances of other heavy elements such as si and o in the icm have also become available .",
    "in particular , asca results ( mushotzky et al . 1996 ) suggested [ @xmath4/fe]@xmath5 @xmath6 + 0.2 dex .",
    "later ishimaru and arimoto ( 1997 ) reanalyzed the same data adopting the meteoritic solar value for the fe abundance , as opposed to the photospheric one used by the previous authors , and concluded that [ @xmath4/fe]@xmath5 @xmath6 0 .",
    "the photospheric solar fe value used to be less certain than the meteoritic one , although more recent measurements ( grevesse et al . 1996 ) of the photospheric fe abundance are in agreement with the meteoritic one .",
    "very recently , tamura et al . ( 2001 ) derived [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios from xmm - newton observation of the cluster which are again roughly solar .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the data show a roughly solar value for the @xmath4-elements / fe ratio in the icm .",
    "this ratio represents a very strong constraint to model the chemical enrichment in galaxies and in the cluster gas .",
    "abundance gradients in the icm of some clusters have been revealed by studies ( finoguenov et al . 2000 ; white 2000 ; de grandi & molendi 2001 ) based on data from asca , rosat and beppo - sax .",
    "however , firm conclusions on abundance gradients in clusters are still premature since the abundance determinations are known to be sensitive to the assumed temperature distribution",
    ".    from the theoretical point of view the first attempts to model the chemical enrichment of the icm were by larson and dinerstein ( 1975 ) , vigroux ( 1977 ) and hinnes and biermann ( 1980 ) .",
    "their models were quite simple and they did not consider the element fe , but only the global metal content z and did not integrate the galactic contributions over the cluster mass function .",
    "matteucci & vettolani ( 1988 ) started a more detailed approach by computing the evolution of fe and @xmath4-elements under the assumption that type ia sne are the major producers of fe and by integrating the galactic contributions over the schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function of cluster galaxies .",
    "their approach was followed by david et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , arnaud et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , renzini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , elbaz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) , gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) , loewenstein and mushotzky ( 1996 ) , martinelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , chiosi ( 2000 ) among others .",
    "the majority of these papers assumed that galactic winds ( mainly from ellipticals ) are responsible for the icm chemical enrichment .",
    "alternatively , the abundances in the icm could be due to ram pressure stripping ( hinnes and biermann 1980 ) or to pre - galactic population iii stars ( white & rees 1978 ; loewenstein 2001 ) .",
    "early attempts to model the icm thermodynamics were originally based on the assumption that the gas is only affected by gravitational processes ( kaiser 1986 ; evrard 1991 ) , such as adiabatic compression and accretion shocks .",
    "such models , which assume the icm to behave in a self - similar fashion , were soon recognized to fail in accounting for several observational facts , such as the shape and evolution of the @xmath7 relation , and the gas density profiles .",
    "for example , gas heating only from gravitation predicts @xmath8 , whereas observations indicate @xmath9 for @xmath10 kev ( e.g. arnaud & evrard 1999 ) , with negligible evolution out to @xmath11 ( borgani et al .",
    "2001a ) , and an even steeper slope for colder systems ( helsdon & ponman , 2000 ) .",
    "at the same time , the shallower gas profile for poor clusters and groups turns into an excess of icm entropy in central regions with respect to the expectation from self - similar scaling ( ponman et al .",
    "this discrepancy points towards the need of heating the gas before the cluster collapses by some non - gravitational source . this heating would bring the gas on a higher adiabat preventing it from reaching high densities and , therefore , would suppress its x - ray emissivity",
    ". both semi - analytical ( tozzi & norman 2001 ; loewenstein 2001 ) and numerical ( bialek et al . 2001 ; borgani et al .",
    "2001b ) simulations including gas - preheating suggest that about 1 kev per particle of extra - energy is required to break self - similarity .",
    "the possibility that sne can provide this extra - energy has been explored already by several authors ( bower et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al .",
    "2000 ; kravtsov & yepes 2000 ; valageas & silk 1999 ; cf also voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "all of these studied concluded that sne alone can hardly provide the necessary 1 kev per particle and that the energy input from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is required .",
    "however , in all of these studies no detailed chemical evolution and stellar lifetimes nor the contribution from snia were taken into account .    in this paper we model in a self - consistent way both the chemical and thermodynamical history of the icm .",
    "to do that we adopt detailed chemical evolution models for elliptical galaxies where sn - driven galactic winds are triggered by the energy that sne of both types ( ii , ia ) inject into the interstellar medium . to this purpose",
    "we take into account in great detail both nucleosynthesis prescriptions and energy feed - back between sne and ism . in particular , we explore several recipes for sn feedback , in order to check whether sne can supply the necessary extra energy to break the self - similarity .",
    "we then integrate the chemical and energetical contributions from different sne over the cluster luminosity function and predict their evolution as a function of the cosmic time . in section 2 the chemical evolution model for the ellipticals",
    "is described . in section 3",
    "we model the enrichment of the icm as a function of the cosmic time .",
    "in particular , we use a phenomenological evolution for the cluster luminosity function instead of adopting semi - analytical modelling for the formation of galaxy clusters . in section 4",
    "we compare model results with observations and we draw our main conclusions in section 5 . in the following ,",
    "conversion from cosmic time to redshift is done for a cosmological model with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the adopted chemical evolution models ( both one - zone and multi - zone ) for elliptical galaxies are those of matteucci & gibson ( 1995 ) and martinelli et al .",
    "we recall here the main assumptions of these models .",
    "first of all , they belong to the category of the so - called monolithic models since they assume that the collapse of gas into the potential well of a dark matter halo involves a large gas cloud .",
    "this collapse occurs at high redshifts on free - fall timescales , and the star formation rate is quite high since the beginning , thus converting gas into stars before the gas has time to substantially cool and form a disc .",
    "this is particularly true for the one - zone model whereas in the multi - zone model the process of galaxy formation is more complex in the sense that the internal regions continue to form stars for a longer period than the external ones . in the multi - zone model of martinelli",
    "( 1998 ) the galactic wind occurs first in the external galactic regions because of the shallower potential well as compared to the most internal ones . then after the onset of galactic wind the star formation stops and the region evolves passively .",
    "the time of the onset of the galactic wind is therefore a crucial parameter in these models since it fixes the abundances in the galactic stars and those in the ism .",
    "the time for the occurrence of the galactic wind is dictated by the condition that the thermal energy of the gas be equal to or larger than its potential energy .",
    "the basic equations of chemical evolution following the temporal behaviour of the abundances of several species ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , fe ) can be found in the above mentioned papers and we do not recall them here .      the condition for the onset of a galactic wind in galaxies can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the binding energy of the gas ( see section 2.4 ) and @xmath17 indicates the thermal energy of the gas due to injection of energy from sne and stellar winds , respectively .",
    "the thermal energy of the gas due to both sn types ( ii , ia ) is defined as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 represents the sn rate of either type ii or type ia objects ( see later ) .",
    "note that the computation of @xmath20 after the onset of the galactic wind is performed by integrating from the time of occurrence of the wind @xmath21 and not from zero . for computing the thermal energy of the gas due to sne",
    ", matteucci and vettolani ( 1988 ) and matteucci and gibson ( 1995 ) assumed the formulation of cox ( 1972 ) ( hereafter cox72 ) where the efficiency of energy transfer from sne into the ism is taken to be constant at a value :    @xmath22    for @xmath23 years , where @xmath24 is the _ cooling time _",
    ", @xmath25 erg is the explosion energy and @xmath26 is the time elapsed from the sn explosion , whereas it evolves as :    @xmath27    for @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth noting that with these prescriptions each sn deposits effectively into the ism at the end of its evolution only few percents of @xmath29 .",
    "the advantage of adopting the above formulation relative to a simple parametrization of @xmath30 is that we can take into account the time dependence of the sn feed - back since different supernova remnants ( snr ) contribute a different amount of energy according to their evolutionary stage .",
    "however , this formulation is derived for isolated sne : if sne explode in associations , there is the possibility , at least for small galaxies , that the efficiency of energy transfer into the ism can be much larger than estimated above , especially if there is complete overlapping of the snr with the consequent formation of a super - bubble .",
    "the crucial parameter , in the above formulation , is the the cooling time of a snr , @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , this timescale regulates the efficiency of gas cooling as a function of time and influences the time for the onset of the galactic wind . unlike the previous papers ( matteucci & gibson 1995 and martinelli et al . 1998 ) which adopted the old cooling time by cox72 , we adopt here the results about the snr evolution in the ism of cioffi , mckee & bertschinger ( 1988 ) ( hereafter cmb ) which suggest the following cooling time depending on the metallicity : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the hydrogen number density , @xmath34 is the energy released during a sn explosion in units of @xmath35 and we take always @xmath36 .    the old ( cox72 ) and",
    "new ( cmb ) cooling times are compared in fig .",
    "1 , where metallicity and density of the ism evolve in a self - consistent way as functions of time .",
    "the new cooling time is about 3 times shorter than the older one after 0.1 gyr from the beginning of galactic evolution , and soon after 0.2 gyr the metallicity becomes oversolar and @xmath24 decreases by a factor of @xmath37 with the consequence of having a much faster cooling process .",
    "the expression for the energy injected from stellar winds is :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 erg is the energy released into the ism from a typical massive star ( @xmath42 ) through stellar winds during its lifetime and @xmath43 is the efficiency of energy transfer , which we assume to be @xmath44 in according to bradamante et al .",
    "this energy from stellar wind is only important before the onset of the first sn explosions after which it becomes negligible as already shown by gibson ( 1994 ) .",
    "he showed that for objects with luminous masses larger than @xmath45 the energetic input of stellar winds can be neglected , a result confirmed also by our calculations .    the initial mass function ( imf ) is expressed by @xmath46 , defined in the mass range @xmath47 , and we adopt two different prescriptions for it , as shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) which is assumed to be : @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the efficiency of star formation , namely the inverse of the typical timescale for star formation , and therefore expressed in units of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 the gas mass in the galaxy .",
    "the efficiency @xmath50 is chosen to reproduce the present time features of ellipticals .",
    "it is worth nothing , as shown by matteucci ( 1994 ) , that to reproduce the observed correlation between the magnesium index @xmath53 and the iron index @xmath54 in ellipticals one possibility is to assume an efficiency of star formation higher in more massive galaxies .",
    "this leads to the so - called `` inverse wind '' scenario , in the sense that large galaxies develop a wind before the small ones . from the point of view of the calculation of the metals and gas ejected into the icm",
    "there is no difference between `` classic '' models ( those where the galactic wind occurs first in small galaxies ) and `` inverse wind '' models .",
    "here we adopt the classic scenario .",
    "the second novelty of our approach to compute the energetics is that we allow for two different efficiencies of energy transfer for different sn types . in particular",
    ", we explored the case in which sne ia are allowed to transfer all of their initial blast wave energy , namely : @xmath55 the reason for this extremely efficient energy transfer resides in the fact that radiative losses from snia are likely to be negligible , since their explosions occur in a medium already heated by snii ( bradamante et al .",
    "1998 ; recchi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in fact , type ia sne are thought to originate from long living systems , namely white dwarfs in binary systems . on the other hand , for sne ii , which explode first in a cold and dense medium ,",
    "we allow for the cooling to be quite efficient .",
    "in particular , we adopt the efficiency of energy transfer deduced from the prescriptions of cmb , as described before . in the reality ,",
    "the energy injected by type ii sne is perhaps higher , on average , than in cmb , especially for the last stellar generations which explode , like type ia sne , in an already heated and rarefied ism . in this sense",
    ", the assumption on the energy transfer from sne ii should be regarded as a lower limit . however",
    ", this particular choice for the energetic prescriptions produces realistic galaxy models and larger amounts of energy from sne should be rejected , as we discuss in the conclusions .",
    "supernovae are also responsible for the chemical enrichment in heavy elements .",
    "in particular , sne ii , which should be the outcome of the explosion of single massive stars ( @xmath56 ) , are mostly responsible for producing the so - called @xmath4-elements and part of fe . on the other hand ,",
    "the sn ia , possibly originating from white dwarfs in binary systems exploding by c - deflagration , are mostly responsible for the production of fe and iron - peak elements .",
    "we adopted the following nucleosynthesis prescriptions :    * for low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath57 ) the yields by renzini and voli ( 1981 ) * for massive stars , type ii sne ( @xmath58 ) the yields by woosley and weaver ( 1995 ) , their case b. * for sn ia the yields by nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 )      as previously stated , the quantity @xmath19 is defined as the rate of supernovae of either type ia and ii .",
    "the type ia sn rate is computed as follows : @xmath59 this formulation for the sn ia rate was first adopted by greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) and matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) and is based on the progenitor model made of a c - o white dwarf plus a red giant ; @xmath60 is the total mass of the binary system , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the minimum and maximum masses allowed for the adopted progenitor systems , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "also @xmath65 is the mass fraction of the secondary , @xmath66 is the minimum value and @xmath67 is the distribution function",
    ". statistical studies ( e.g. tutukov & yungelson 1979 ) indicates that mass ratios close to one are preferred , so the formula :    @xmath68    is commonly adopted , where @xmath69 is a parameter which we take equal to 2 .",
    "this formulation for the sn ia rate still seems to be the best to describe the chemical evolution of galaxies , as recently discussed by matteucci & recchi ( 2001 ) . finally , the parameter @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) represents the fraction of binary systems in the imf which are able to give rise to sn ia explosions and is a free parameter , fixed by reproducing the present time observed type ia sn rate in elliptical galaxies .    as for the type ii sn rate we can write : @xmath71 where the first integral accounts for the single stars in the range 8 - 16@xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the upper mass limit in the imf .",
    "the function @xmath74 represents the stellar lifetime of a star of mass @xmath75 and is expressed as : @xmath76/0.1116 - 9}\\,\\rm gyr,\\ ] ] for the lifetimes of stars in the range 0.8 - 6.6 @xmath72 ( padovani & matteucci 1993 ) , whereas we adopt : @xmath77 for stars with masses @xmath78 .",
    "the binding energy of the gas for the one - zone model is computed as in matteucci & gibson ( 1995 ) : @xmath79 where : @xmath80 is the gravitational energy of the gas due to the luminous matter , and : @xmath81 is the gravitational energy due to the dark matter , where @xmath82 is the _ effective radius _ and @xmath83 is a term taking into account the distribution of the dark matter relative to the luminous one , in particular :    @xmath84\\ ] ]    where @xmath85 is the ratio between the effective radius and the core radius of the dark matter .",
    "realistic values for this ratio are @xmath86 ( see bertin et al .",
    "for all the ellipticals we set @xmath87 and @xmath88 , since with these prescriptions one obtains realistic models for elliptical galaxies ( matteucci 1992 ) .    for the multi - zone model",
    "we adopt the same formulation of martinelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) where the galaxy is divided in several concentric shells and the potential well is calculated in each of them . in this way",
    "the external regions are less bound than the innermost ones thus creating a situation of `` biased - galactic - wind '' in the sense that the galactic wind starts first in the external regions and gradually develops in the more internal ones .",
    "this mechanism is in good agreement with the observed correlation between escape velocity and metallicity inside ellipticals which shows that where the escape velocity is larger then the metallicity is also larger ( carollo & danziger 1994 ) .",
    "the distribution of the dark matter is assumed to be the same as in the one - zone model , whereas the distribution of luminous matter follows that of jaffe ( 1983 ) .",
    "this kind of multizone model well reproduces both abundance ( martinelli et al . 1998 ) and color ( menanteau et al . 2001 ) gradients inside ellipticals .",
    "we have computed several galactic models by varying some parameters such as the imf and the sn feed - back .",
    "we will describe here only the best ones of each kind .",
    "we assume galaxies to have formed 13 gyr ago corresponding to a formation redshift @xmath89 for the adopted cosmology .",
    "it is worth noting that all of the models described here reproduce the main features of elliptical galaxies , such as the present time type ia sn rate , the metallicity of the dominant stellar population and the color - magnitude diagram , as already discussed in previous papers where we address the reader for details ( matteucci and gibson , 1995 ; matteucci , ponzone & gibson 1998 ; martinelli , matteucci & colafrancesco , 1998 ; menanteau et al .",

    "the main assumptions are that only ellipticals and s0 galaxies pollute the icm and that sne ii and ia are the major responsible of the chemical enrichment and the non - gravitational heating of the icm . to do that ,",
    "we have adopted chemical evolution models for elliptical galaxies which reproduce the majority of the observational constraints and predicted the chemical enrichment of the icm by integrating the contribution of cluster galaxies over the cluster luminosity function .",
    "several prescriptions for the energy feed - back between sne and ism have been adopted in the galaxy models and their effects on the chemical and thermal history of the icm have been studied .",
    "relative to previous models we have considered the energy feed - back in more detail and included the effect of sne ia , often neglected in this kind of calculations . in particular , we have assumed that type ia sne can inject all of their initial blast wave energy into the ism .",
    "we have allowed for the variation of the cluster luminosity function as a function of redshift and computed the evolution of the icm abundances in time .",
    "the same procedure has been applied to the total thermal energy contributed by cluster galaxies through galactic winds .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * both one- and multi - zone models with salpeter imf and evolution of spirals into s0 galaxies can reproduce the observed fe abundance and the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios in the icm .",
    "in particular , there is good agreement between the predicted and observed [ si / fe ] ratios whereas the predicted [ o / fe ] ratios are lower than indicated by some observations . however , the o measurements in the icm are still very sparse and uncertain and more data are required to assess this point ( but see gastaldello & molendi 2002 observations for ) . from the theoretical point of view we expect that [ o / fe ] @xmath97 [ si / fe ] , since si is also produced by type ia sne whereas o is not . *",
    "we predict an icm iron - mass - to - light - ratio @xmath98 for all clusters , in very good agreement with the observed one ( e.g. renzini , 1997 ) . we have also computed the amount of metals which remains locked up inside stars .",
    "we found that the fe in the icm should be 5 times more than the fe in stars , whereas o and the global metal content should be roughly the same inside stars and in the icm . *",
    "our best model is a multi - zone one ( model ii ) , where the galaxy is divided in several shells developing the galactic wind first in the external regions and then in the internal ones .",
    "* the best model , which reproduces the icm abundances , can provide 0.20 - 0.35 kev of energy per icm particle , depending on the cluster richness .",
    "this result has been obtained for a total efficiency of energy transfer from sne ii plus sn ia of @xmath99 . *",
    "little evolution is found both for the abundances and for the heating energy from z=0 up to z=1 , in agreement with observations ( matsumoto et al . 2000 ) . *",
    "we predict [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios for the intergalactic medium at high redshift ( @xmath100 ) to be near zero ( solar ) or slightly negative , indicating that already at those early times a considerable amount of fe should be present .",
    "the existing uncertanties on snii yields would affect slightly the value of the final [ @xmath4/fe ] but not the substance of our reasoning , as already stressed by renzini ( 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , the strong point is that the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios are predicted to be negative or solar at the present time due to the fe which is restored continuously as opposed to the @xmath4-elements which stop to be produced starting from the time of the occurrence of the galactic winds . *   in both old and new models , while type ii sne dominate the chemical evolution of the ellipticals and are the main responsible for the onset of a galactic wind , type ia sne play a fundamental role in providing energy ( @xmath101 ) and fe ( @xmath102 ) into the icm .",
    "again , uncertainties of a factor of 2 in snii yields for fe , would translate only in a @xmath103 ( i.e. @xmath104 dex ) uncertainty in the total fe mass ejected into the icm in our best model , without affecting our results .",
    "therefore , snia can not be neglected in computing the chemical and thermal evolution of the icm .    in view of the relevance of the sn energy feedback for the thermal history of the icm",
    ", it is worth discussing how robust is our determination of @xmath105 kev per particle .    by assuming an efficiency of energy transfer of 100@xmath0 from both sn types , we obtain a significantly larger energy budget of @xmath106 kev per particle .",
    "however , with such an extreme efficiency the energy injected into the ism is larger than the galaxy binding energy .",
    "therefore , the natural conclusion is that a large fraction of the sn energy budget should be radiatively lost ( see also renzini et al .",
    "we estimate that at most @xmath107 of the overall sn efficiency is allowed in order not to unbind gas from the galaxy potential well . as an alternative route",

    "however , such stars are rare enough ( @xmath110 ) to give only a modest increase of the icm energy input from sne . in summary , these results show that the overall efficiency of energy transfer from sne into the icm ranges between 20% and 35% , within the model uncertainties , so that @xmath111 kev .",

    "ray observations of galaxy clusters ? both analytical methods ( e.g. cavaliere , menci & tozzi , balogh et al .",

    "however , this energy is determined within a factor two , owing to the uncertainties in the detail of the heating mechanism , the redshift at which the energy in dumped into the icm and the local density of the targetted gas . furthermore ,",
    "the inclusion of radiative cooling has been also suggested to decrease the required energy ( e.g. voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "in fact , cooling causes high  density , low entropy gas to disappear from the diffuse icm phase , thus leading to an effective increase of the entropy and to a decrease of density of hot gas , similar to non  gravitational heating . therefore , within the uncertainty in our capability of treating the complex icm physics , our results should be taken only as suggestive that sne may not provide enough extra energy . in this case ,",
    "alternative astrophysical sources for icm heating should be devised , such as energy release from galactic nuclear activity ( agn ; e.g. valageas & silk 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ) .",
    "available and forthcoming observations from chandra and xmm satellites are expected to provide a radical change in our view of the icm . the availability of icm observations with good spatial and spectral resolution is now opening the possibility of tracing the pattern of metal enrichment and , therefore , of better connecting the icm chemistry to the star formation history in clusters .",
