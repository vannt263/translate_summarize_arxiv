    "quasi - particle excitations of collective oscillations and rotations of charges coupled to magnetic field , edge magnetoplasmons , are gapless modes localized on perimeter of pool of electron gas . in conventional two - dimensional electron gas systems ( 2degs ) , magnetoplasmon frequency , for a bounded electron liquid , splits into bulk and edge modes .",
    "the edge magnetoplasmons propagate unidirectionally along the perimeter with chirality determined by the sign of an applied magnetic field .",
    "graphene has emerged as a new kind of 2degs which is a two - dimensional material of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattice .",
    "magnetoplasmon frequencies in graphene are unique and observed at rather low excitation energy . the behavior can be attributed to the ultra - relativistic nature of charges combined with its linear band structure .    in general ,",
    "finite samples are characterized by physical edges .",
    "edge states come from one - body confinement potential from the boundary which bends energy levels up or down near the edge .",
    "the resultant effect is that charges are pushed over a chemical potential sandwiched between two landau energy levels .",
    "the source of the confinement potential is very different between 2degs and graphene .",
    "it is provided by dopants in the 2degs and solely by presence of graphene boundaries .",
    "the study of edge charge dynamics in quantum hall regime has gained renewed interest both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "in particular , edge magnetoplasmons ( emps ) in graphene is studied only recently , over a decade after its successful isolation in 2004 . however , previous studies only investigated emps at @xmath2 integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) and based on sharp electron density profiles at the boundary . even at this state ,",
    "emp dynamics in graphene are already different from the 2degs . for large system size",
    "that is best suited for hydrodynamic description , radio - frequency emp resonance peaks are detected on hall plateaus  @xcite in 2degs . in ref .",
    "@xcite , magnetoplsmon resonances in non - quantum hall regime was observed .",
    "these resonant excitations are yet to be investigated in graphene within fractional quantum hall regime . to explore further , we employed a quantized point vortex hydrodynamics theory of euler equations .",
    "quantized vortices ( qvs ) have been widely observed in physical systems ; liquid helium , type - ii superconductors and ultracold atom gases in optical lattices .",
    "fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) is another example . in particular , upon application of perpendicular magnetic field to dirac fluid in graphene , vortices arise from motion of dirac fermions near k and k@xmath3 valleys  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fluxes are viewed as topological defects capable of deforming fluid boundaries . in the limit of large vortices - caused by strong magnetic field ,",
    "the vortex matter alone fully characterized the flow and dynamics of electrons is properly described by equations of classical hydrodynamics . thus , the use of microscopic electronic theory becomes a matter of choice . like electrons , in finite incompressible fluid vortices",
    "are pushed to sample boundary and are drift along it by a potential gradient leading to an excitable one - dimensional system .",
    "we are wondering to investigate basic features of low - energy magnetoplasmon excitations localized and propagating at edges of quantum vortex hall fluid , using hydrodynamic euler and continuity equations .",
    "we observed emp excitations on fractional vortex hall plateaus .",

    "it is considered as frozen into the fluid and constitute its own fluid .",
    "the continuity equation for the vortex fluid @xmath21 , also holds .",
    "we regard vortices as localized solutions of the euler equation . in two - dimensional disk geometry , a point vortex solution exists .",
    "the kirchoff equation obtained from eq .  [ eq : mvfluid ] for the motion of fluid particles is  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the circulation and @xmath26 which is identified with cyclotron frequency of the fluid particles .",
    "the edge effect is introduced by image vortices located at @xmath27 . assuming a flow in which the circulation , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is both minimal and chiral so that in the limit , @xmath30 rotation is compensated by the large number of vortices . for magnetic field ,",

    "writing v interms of u using the identities @xmath39 and @xmath40 \\equiv [ \\sum(1/(z - z_i)]^2 - \\sum[1/(z - z_i)]^2 $ ] , it is straight forward to show that  @xcite @xmath41 .",
    "we can recast the expression as @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the drift velocity of vortices confined by the potential , @xmath10 . in order to capture quantum effects needed to qualitatively explain experimental results , we sort a quantized version of eq .",

    "it is important to mention that a quantized equation  [ eq : vortex ] in the complex coordinates ( @xmath64 ) , immediately leads to halperin - like fractional quantum hall states for graphene .",

    "theoretically , quantum hall fluid edges are modeled by sharp boundaries which often lead to an over simplifications and may fail to capture important physics at the edge .",
    "nonetheless , a fundamental emp mode is always present . in reality , the edges of hall fluid are never sharp but ( smooth and ) rounded on the scale of @xmath68 .",
    "the smoothness is caused by clustering of vortices at the edges and subsequently performing small cyclotron oscillations with period far less than that of the emps .",
    "it is possible to have dipole moment within the boundary layer @xmath69 which has been largely ignored in literature  @xcite .",

    "we particularly note that for both smooth and sharp edges , the second resonant mode becomes well noticed for @xmath97 .",
    "the sharper peak in this limit indicates the more vortices formed and interact to cause excitations .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the @xmath98 limit , which involves less vortices as seen from the flattening of the curves as boundary deformations become strong .    in conclusion",
