    "<S> coupling of the `` chemistry '' to the flow or elasticity is a necessary ingredient of the fast propagation of a pt wave .    </S>",
    "<S> a related problem is the propagation of condensation and evaporation waves in fluids . in this case , a consistent description is possible , based on the combination of the corresponding navier - stokes ( ns ) and heat - transport equations with the equation of state , e.g. , the van der waals ( vdw ) one @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite demonstrates that a flat pt wave in a bulk medium is driven by the heat transfer giving rise to a slowly advancing front . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is drastically different in 1d case , corresponding , e.g. , to the fluid inside a capillar , which allows to impose _ isothermal _ conditions , @xmath17 = const . </S>",

    "<S> the front may be arbitrary , the velocity being determined by the boundary conditions . neglecting the @xmath43 terms , it is @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 , this yields the sound velocity at a given density , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the pt front may move _ faster _ than sound velocity in the metastable phase invaded by the front . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the velocity @xmath47 is transonic , provided that @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pt wave is related to detonation , whose characteristic feature is transonic propagation @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> they contain a new effect , breaking the symmetry between the condensation ( @xmath59 ) and evaporation ( @xmath60 ) waves : the @xmath43-corrected threshold value of the viscosity @xmath61 , below which there is a region of the nonexistence of steady pt waves , is @xmath62 .    in systematic numerical simulations of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ns ] ) and ( [ cont ] ) , the @xmath43-corrections were omitted , and @xmath22 was eliminated , differentiating eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ cont ] ) ( for some typical cases , it was checked that the @xmath43 terms produce a small insignificant change of the numerical solution ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equation of the second order in @xmath52 and fourth order in @xmath63 was numerically integrated with the initial conditions @xmath66 , @xmath67 being a smoothed step between the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for the boundary conditions ( b.c . ) </S>",
    "<S> , it was always taken that @xmath70 at the left edge and @xmath71 at both edges . </S>",
    "<S> note that the natural b.c . </S>",
    "<S> for the flow , @xmath72 , is compatible with these , as is seen from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cont ] ) . the b.c . for the flow at the right edge </S>",
    "<S> is not fixed , because , as a matter of fact , we are dealing with an open system , with a possible influx of fluid from @xmath73 .    in the case </S>",
    "<S> when the steady pt front exists , the fourth b.c . </S>",
    "<S> was naturally taken as @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations have demonstrated that the steady front is always stable when it exists . </S>",
    "<S> when it does not exist , the density to be established past the pt wave is unknown , therefore initial @xmath39 was taken arbitrarily from the absolute stability region @xmath28 . in this case , the missing b.c . </S>",
    "<S> was taken as @xmath75 ( i.e. , the density profile must be flat ) at the right edge . </S>",
    "<S> the results displayed below clearly show that no artifacts are generated by b.c .    a representative picture of the _ nonsteady _ propagation of the condensation front , when the steady one does not exist , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> essential features revealed by many simulations are well seen in it : ( i ) the nonsteady pt wave immediately begins to generate two asws in forward and backward directions ; ( ii ) the forward asw ( _ precursor _ ) travels essentially faster than the pt front , so that a rapidly expanding trough with an increased value @xmath76 is formed ahead of the front ; ( iii ) the fast backward - propagating asw hits the right edge , bounces from it , and then hits the pt front . </S>",
    "<S> velocities of all the observed asws were checked to comply with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ shock ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the first finding is that the nonsteady pt wave does not self - accelerate , which could be natural to expect @xcite ; instead , it generates a strong acoustic precursor . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a demonstrates that in all the cases with @xmath77 the newly established value @xmath78 of the density ahead of the front originally turns out to be fairly close to @xmath49 , corresponding to the minimum of @xmath79 at which the steady pt wave exists . </S>",
    "<S> then , quasi - steady propagation of the pt wave with the density @xmath80 ahead of it becomes possible . </S>",
    "<S> note that simulations of 2d hydrodynamic equations with the vdw equation of state , in the problem of transverse instability of shock waves , have also revealed strong emission of acoustic waves @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the pt front decelerates and eventually comes to halt , while the precursor keeps propagating at a nearly constant velocity until it hits the left edge of the integration domain ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , simulations show that the pt front begins then to slowly move in the reverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider the reverse motion in detail , as it is a manifestation of finiteness of the system , while in this work we focus on properties of a semiinfinite ( to the left ) system , although , of course , finiteness effects may be important for experiment . as concerns the value of @xmath81 ahead of the pt front , at a later stage of the evolution it slowly increases from the originally established value @xmath82 to @xmath83 at the halt stage . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood , as @xmath83 is the _ binodal _ ( a minimum value of @xmath84 at which the interface between the two phases may be quiescent ) . </S>",
    "<S> the halt of the front at @xmath85 implies that the density behind it must take the conjugate value @xmath86 , which is indeed observed , see below .    </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing case is @xmath87 , when the nonsteady situation is possible whilst the maximum velocity of the steadily moving pt exceeds the sound velocity at @xmath88 , suggesting that the pt front can not send a sound wave ahead of itself . a typical picture for this case </S>",
    "<S> is displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , which shows that the acoustic precursor is nevertheless launched . </S>",
    "<S> the difference from the previous case is that the trough before the pt front quickly deepens , so that @xmath78 , rather than being stuck at the value @xmath49 , quickly drops to the binodal value @xmath89 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to pt coming to halt earlier than in the case @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an attempt to launch a `` superfast '' pt front into a deeply metastable phase produces an opposite result : the front generates strong acoustic waves and decelerates , seeing a less metastable state ahead of itself ( physically , the metastability is relatively deep , as everything happens close to the critical point ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an altogether different result is found at very small @xmath61 , viz . , onset of instability , which quickly switches the system into a fully turbulent state and destroys the interface . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with the initial values @xmath90 before the interface and @xmath91 behind it , the instability sets in at @xmath92 . however , systematic study the present system as a model of 1d turbulence is beyond the scope of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation behind the pt front deserves special description . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that asw which hits the pt front in the last configuration shown in the upper part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 bounces from the front , travels to the right edge , is reflected from it , and then again hits the pt front ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . a nontrivial feature of asw in this case , evident in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , is that it is reflected by the pt front as an _ antishock _ , or rarefaction wave . </S>",
    "<S> the present model does not admit steady rarefaction waves ; however , the wave in fig . 4 is unsteady , as it propagates between variable densities . taking instantaneous values of the densities , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the antishock s velocity also obeys eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ shock ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the numerical results leads to the following inferences concerning the shuttling shock / antishock wave behind the pt front in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1 and 4 : ( i ) bounces from both the right edge of the system and pt front do not change the absolute value of the velocity ; ( ii ) bounces from the right edge are elastic without a change in the step height ( @xmath93 ) ; ( iii ) bounces from the pt front are highly _ inelastic _ : the shock bounces as an antishock and vice versa , each reflection decreasing the step height by a factor @xmath94 , which explains why the shuttling wave disappears after a few reflections .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the system eventually drives itself into an equilibrium state with a quiescent interface between the liquid and vapor phases . a mechanism establishing the equilibrium is the generation of acoustic shocks , which bounce elastically from the system edge , but are muffled by strongly inelastic collisions with the interface .    </S>",
