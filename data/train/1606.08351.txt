    "in recent years high quality experimental and numerical simulations data became available for superfluid turbulence due to considerable progress in experimental and numerical simulations technique ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these data provides a possibility for an advance in our understanding of the superfluid turbulence . in particular , in a recent ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown , using the experimental data reported in the ref .",
    "@xcite , that distributed chaos plays a significant role in superfluid ( he ii ) turbulent flow behind a grid .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to investigate role of the distributed chaos in superfluid turbulence using also the data of the direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . unlike the experimental data the data obtained in the dns allow to separate between the viscous ( normal ) and inviscid ( superfluid ) components of velocity field ( in the two - fluid model @xcite,@xcite ) and between incompressible , compressible and quantum components of the velocity field ( for the gross - pitaevskii model of the bose - einstein condensates at low temperatures @xcite )",
    "this separation provides an additional information about underlying physical processes .",
    "+ the turbulence in the superfluid flows is as a rule inhomogeneous .",
    "let us recall that for the distributed chaos with ( a soft ) spontaneous translational symmetry ( homogeneity ) breaking @xcite the vorticity correlation integral @xmath3 dominates scaling of the group velocity of the waves driving the chaos @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( from the dimensional considerations ) .",
    "then the stretched exponential spectra of the distributed chaos @xmath6 have @xmath7 in this case .",
    "a liquid @xmath8he goes through a phase transition at @xmath9 k and at @xmath10 it becomes a superfluid he ii .",
    "the two - fluid model was suggested by l. landau @xcite for a phenomenological description of the superfluid he ii .",
    "it is suggested in this model that the he ii can be seen as a superposition of a viscous ( normal - with the navier - stokes dynamics ) and supeflud ( euler dynamics with quantized vorticity ) components coupling by a friction term .",
    "then this model was developed into so - called truncated hall - vinen - bekeravich - khalatnikov ( hvbk @xcite ) model with a cut - off associated with the quantum scale @xmath11 ( an inter - vortex spacing ) @xcite . the most of information about the _",
    "quantized _ vorticity ( such as the kelvin waves , for instance ) is smoothed out by the scale @xmath11 in this truncated model . therefore , the main physics is concentrated here in the mutual coupling term for the navier - stokes and euler equations @xcite .    before considering results of a dns based on this model",
    "let us specify power spectrum expected for distributed chaos corresponding to the viscous ( normal ) component of the velocity field .",
    "for the viscous component just viscosity - @xmath12 , is the parameter that should determine the scaling eq .",
    "( 2 ) instead of the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "then from the dimensional consideration we obtain @xmath14 with @xmath15 . substituting this value of @xmath16 into eq .",
    "( 4 ) one obtains @xmath17    in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite results of direct numerical simulations on the basis of the above described model ( in cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , resolution @xmath18 for t = 2.1565 k and @xmath19 for t = 1.15 k ) were reported .",
    "stationarity of the turbulence is provided by an external force ( isotropic ) at scale @xmath20 .",
    "figure 1 shows the power spectrum obtained in these simulations ( the data were taken from fig . 5 in the ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the viscous ( normal ) component of the velocity field at t=2.1565 k. the dashed straight line indicates ( in the scales chosen for this figure ) the stretched exponential spectrum eq .",
    "( 3 ) with the @xmath21 given by eq . ( 6 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows analogous data but obtained for the inviscid ( superfluid ) component of the velocity field .",
    "the dashed straight line indicates ( in the scales chosen for this figure ) the stretched exponential spectrum eq .",
    "( 3 ) with the @xmath2 given by eq . ( 4 ) .",
    "one can see that unlike the case of the viscous ( normal ) component the distributed chaos for the superfluid component is determined by the soft spontaneous breaking of the space translational symmetry ( homogeneity ) , with domination of the vorticity correlation integral eq .",
    "one should remember that the viscosity have an influence on the superfluid component of the velocity field due to the mutual coupling terms ( friction ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the power spectrum for viscous ( normal ) component of velocity field obtained in the same dns as that shown in fig . 1 but for very low temperature t = 1.15 k. as in fig .",
    "1 the dashed straight line indicates the stretched exponential spectrum eq . ( 3 ) with the @xmath21 given by eq .",
    ". however , there is something new in this case . the stretched exponential part of the spectrum with @xmath22 exhibits tuning of the @xmath23 to the wavenumber equal to position of the spectral peak ( see the arrow under the peak in fig .",
    "the tuning in the case of the superfluid component is even more interesting at this low temperature . in this case",
    "the distributed chaos inherits a property of deterministic chaos - subharmonic tuning .",
    "let us consider the famous lorenz equations @xmath24 it is an oversimplified model for classic thermal convection @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows power spectrum of @xmath25-component of the lorenz strange attractor ( deterministic chaos at @xmath26 ) .",
    "the maximum entropy method was used for computing this spectrum .",
    "the straight line indicates exponential spectrum typical for the smooth deterministic chaos .",
    "the tuning in this case is subharmonic ( period - doubling ) : the fundamental frequency ( the first spectral peak ) equals to @xmath27 ( see arrow under the first peak ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the power spectrum for superfluid component of velocity field obtained in the same dns as that shown in fig . 2 but for the lower temperature t = 1.15 k. as in fig .",
    "2 the dashed straight line indicates the stretched exponential spectrum eq . ( 3 ) with the @xmath2 given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( domination of the vorticity correlation integral eq . ( 1 ) ) .",
    "the arrow under the peak indicates the subharmonic tuning of the distributed chaos .",
    "the tuning observed at the low temperature t = 1.15 k can be related to increase in coherence for lower temperatures .",
    "a very interesting dns was reported in a recent ref . @xcite . in this dns superfluid turbulence",
    "was generated by a moving grid in the frames of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath28 with @xmath29 as the condensed particles mass .",
    "this is a non - linear schrdinger equation for wave - function @xmath30 usually used for the low temperature limit description of the bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the superfluid velocity is obtained by the madelung s transformation @xmath31}$ ] , with @xmath32 as density of the superfluid and @xmath33 as its velocity field ( the domain generally is not simply connected , see also @xcite for a generalization of vorticity and corresponding adiabatic invariant ) .      the author of the ref .",
    "@xcite reports about two stage development of the wake behind the grid .",
    "the first stage is characterized by injection of incompressible kinetic energy due to nucleation of the vortex rings generated by the moving grid . at certain effective mach number the vortex ring nucleation saturates and stops . before this saturation",
    "an inhomogeneous turbulent state is observed in the dns . in the second stage the mutual friction results in the rings shrinking .",
    "figure 6 shows the incompressible part of the turbulent energy spectrum - containing the vortices contribution ( distance from the grid @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the coherence length , which is approximately equal to the vortex core size ) . as in fig .",
    "5 the dashed straight line indicates the stretched exponential spectrum eq . ( 3 ) with the @xmath2 given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( domination of the vorticity correlation integral eq .",
    "the arrow under the peak indicates the subharmonic tuning of the distributed chaos .    while the above used hvbk model smoothed out the quantized vortices the gross - pitaevskii model provides more details for description of the quantum turbulence .",
    "although the gross - pitaevskii model was primarily intended for the bose - einstein condensates at low temperatures , one can expect that it can be useful for superfluid turbulence in helium as well ( cf . figs .",
