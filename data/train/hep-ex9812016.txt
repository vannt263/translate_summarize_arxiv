    "the p - wave spin - triplet charmonium states were originally observed  @xcite in radiative decays of the @xmath1 soon after the discovery of the @xmath16 and @xmath1 resonances . a number of decay modes of these states have been observed and branching fractions reported  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing results are from the mark  i experiment , which had a data sample of 0.33 million @xmath1 decays  @xcite . because the photon capabilities of the mark  i detector were limited , the detection of the photon from the @xmath17 process was not required , and one constraint kinematic fits were used to reconstruct the final states .",
    "recently there has been a renewed interest in the p - wave charmonium states . since in lowest - order perturbative",
    "qcd the @xmath12 and @xmath18 decay via the annihilation of their constituent @xmath19 quarks into two gluons , followed by the hadronization of the gluons into light mesons and baryons , these decays are expected to be similar to those of a bound @xmath20 state ; a detailed knowledge of the hadronic decays of the @xmath12 and @xmath18 may provide an understanding of the decay patterns of glueball states that will help in their identification .",
    "the mass differences between the three @xmath21 states provide information on the spin - orbit and tensor interactions in non - relativistic potential models and lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the masses of the @xmath22 and @xmath18 have been precisely determined ( to a level of @xmath23  mev ) by fermilab experiment e760  @xcite using the line shape measured in the @xmath24 formation reaction .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath12 mass is much more poorly known ; the pdg average for @xmath25 has an uncertainty of @xmath26  mev  @xcite .    in this paper , we report the analyses of all - charged - track final states from @xmath27 decays , including @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the results for @xmath27 decays into @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we use the combined invariant mass distribution from all of the channels under study to determine the @xmath12 mass with improved precision .",
    "a byproduct of this analysis is a determination of the mass of the @xmath37 .",
    "this is of interest because the @xmath38 mass difference measures the strength of the hyperfine splitting term in heavy quark interactions .",
    "however , in spite of a number of measurements , the current experimental value of @xmath39 remains ambiguous : the pdg  @xcite average is based on a fit to seven measurements with poor internal consistency  @xcite and the confidence level of the fit is only 0.001 . a recent measurement from e760  @xcite disagrees with the value reported by the dm2 group  @xcite by almost four standard deviations .",
    "additional measurements may help clarify the situation .",

    "a neutral cluster is considered to be a photon candidate when the angle in the @xmath61 plane between the nearest charged track and the cluster is greater than @xmath62 , the first hit is in the beginning 6 radiation lengths , and the difference between the angle of the cluster development direction in the bsc and the photon emission direction is less than @xmath63 .",
    "when these selection criteria are applied to kinematically selected samples of @xmath64 and @xmath65 events , fewer than 20% of the events have @xmath66 candidates , which indicates that the fake - photon rejection ability is adequate ( see fig .  [ ngm ] ) .",
