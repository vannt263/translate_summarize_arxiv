    "recently , an interesting and attractive idea that all the supersymmetric particles could only appear inside the loops has been introduced @xcite . by modifying the quantization techniques of the supersymmetric particles",
    ", they can not appear in the out - legs of any feynmann diagrams , just like the faddeev - popov ghosts .",
    "thus , it means that we can only detect the existence of these off - shell particles by measuring the radiative loop effects rather then finding these particles directly on colliders .",
    "this idea can be generalized to other models .",
    "the new particles invented in these models can be hidden inside the loop in order to escape the detections . in general , these new particles should be assigned with charges of some unbroken symmetries in order for them to form closed loops , without any channels decaying into pure standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is the r - parity of the supersymmetric particles to play this role .    in this paper , we invent off - shell tachyons @xcite to be quantized in the unconventional way .",
    "this lead to a solution to the zero result of the loop - diagrams involving off - shell non - tachyonic particles when we apply the half - retarded and half - advanced propagators introduced in ref .",
    "thus , we could not see an `` on - shell '' tachyon so that we need not worry about observing something moving faster than the light , and these off - shell tachyons contribute to the loop - diagrams , leaving us some observable effects .",
    "without loss of generality , we introduce an unbroken @xmath2 symmetry in this paper . usually , the non - tachyonic @xmath2-odd particles can decay into the lightest @xmath2-odd particle .",
    "if some of these @xmath2-odd particles are quantized through the unconventional way described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the other @xmath2-odd particles are quantized through the normal way , inconsistencies will be the case .",
    "suppose @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two @xmath2-odd particles , and @xmath5 .",
    "if both particles are quantized through the normal way , the decay @xmath6cp - even particles@xmath7 can usually happen .",
    "the self - energy diagrams @xmath6cp - even particles@xmath8 also contain imaginary parts which contribute to the width of the @xmath4 s breit - wigner propagator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the decay - width .",
    "however , if @xmath3 is quantized through the normal way , and @xmath4 is quantized through the unconventional way , the diagram @xmath6cp - even particles@xmath7 can still move the pole of the @xmath4 s propagator by a quantity of @xmath11 , which destroys the structure of the propagator @xmath12 or @xmath13 invented in ref . @xcite .",
    "these are the principal values of the propagator , and should be applied when a particle is quantized through the unconventional way",

    "the integral over the phase space is actually infinite due to the divergence of the propagator @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both quantized through the normal way , this non - physical infinite can be subtracted by eliminating the on - shell @xmath20-effects @xmath21 in our appendix , we will derive ( [ os_subtraction ] ) and will show that how the on - shell effects be subtracted",
