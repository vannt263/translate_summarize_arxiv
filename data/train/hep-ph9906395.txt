    "in all probability a higgs boson will be discovered at either lep ii , run ii of the tevatron , or the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "it is then inevitable that the emphasis of higgs physics will be turned away from discovery and instead will focus on the investigation of higgs boson properties , such as its mass , width and branching ratios .",
    "although much interesting higgs phenomenology can be done at the lhc , many analyses are made infeasible by the rather messy nature of hadron colliders .",
    "instead one must resort to the much cleaner environment of @xmath5 annihilations , for example , at the linear collider ( lc ) @xcite , where precision measurements at the tev scale can be made .",
    "one particularly interesting task to be carried out at future colliders is the reconstruction of the higgs potential itself , possibly confirming , or denying , the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the trilinear @xmath6 and quadrilinear @xmath7 higgs self - couplings , which can then be compared with the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) , or indeed the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or @xmath3 bosons @xcite , @xmath0 or @xmath8 fusion @xcite , gluon - gluon fusion @xcite or @xmath9 fusion @xcite . ] .",
    "a measurement of the trilinear term , @xmath6 , is the first step in reconstructing the higgs potential . at a future @xmath5 collider ,",
    "the @xmath6 coupling of the sm is accessible through double higgs - strahlung off @xmath3 bosons , in the process @xmath1 .",
    "this is the mechanism with which we will be concerned in this paper ( for the mssm see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the sm signal of the trilinear higgs self - coupling has been thoroughly investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( with its mssm counterparts ) , and was found to be small but measurable for an intermediate mass higgs boson , given a high integrated luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the quadrilinear vertex , @xmath7 , is unmeasurable at the energy scale of the proposed lcs due to suppression by an additional power of the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "however , in measuring @xmath6 , one must be sure that the already small signal can be distinguished from its backgrounds without being appreciably reduced . here",
    "we will examine the @xmath10 decay channel over the higgs mass range @xmath11 gev and present kinematic cuts to aid its selection .",
    "the case of off- and on - shell @xmath12 decays for @xmath13 gev is under examination elsewhere @xcite .",
    "if one assumes very efficient tagging and high - purity sampling of @xmath14 quarks , the backgrounds to a @xmath6 measurement from double higgs events in the @xmath15 decay channel are primarily the ` irreducible ' ones via @xmath16 intermediate states @xcite , which can be separated into ew and qcd backgrounds . furthermore , the double higgs - strahlung process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hh ] ) : @xmath17 contains diagrams proceeding via an @xmath18 intermediate state but not dependent on @xmath6 ( graphs 13 in fig .",
    "[ fig_hh ] ) , as well as that sensitive to the trilinear higgs self - coupling ( graph 4 in fig .  [ fig_hh ] ) .",
    "in addition , we also include four extra diagrams , which differ only in the exchange of the four - momenta and helicities of two identical @xmath14 quarks ( or , equivalently , antiquarks ) and a minus sign ( due to fermi - dirac statistics pertinent to identical fermionic particles ) .",
    "however , the narrow width of the higgs resonance ensures that the interference will be negligible and these extra diagrams could be included by symmetry .",
    "the other two backgrounds proceed via purely ew interactions ( see figs .  [ fig_h][fig_n ] ) , @xmath19 and via qcd couplings as well ( see fig .  [ fig_q ] ) , @xmath20 and both contain no more than one intermediate higgs boson",
    ". the ew background , process  ( [ eeew ] ) , is of @xmath21 away from resonances , but can , in principle , be problematic due to the presence of both @xmath3 vectors and higgs scalars yielding @xmath22 pairs .",
    "finally , the qcd background , process  ( [ eeqcd ] ) , is of @xmath23 away from resonances . here",
    ", although there are no heavy objects decaying to @xmath22 pairs , the production rate itself could give difficulties due to the presence of the strong coupling .",
    "as with process  ( [ eehhz ] ) , one must include diagrams with the interchange of the two identical @xmath14 ( anti)quarks also in the ew and qcd background processes .",
    "in contrast to the signal , here interference effects are sizable .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section details the procedure adopted in computing the relevant scattering amplitudes . sect .",
    "[ sec_results ] displays our numerical results and contains our discussion .",
    "finally , in the last section , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the double higgs - strahlung process ( [ eehhz ] ) proceeds at lowest - order through the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig_hh ] , as explained in the introduction .",
    "they are rather straightforward to calculate in the case of on - shell @xmath18 production ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an analytic expression of the me ) .    the ew background ( [ eeew ] ) derives from many graphs : 550 in total ( again , considering the @xmath14 ( anti)quark statistics ) .",
    "however , they can conveniently be grouped into different ` topologies ' : that is , collections of diagrams with identical ( non-)resonant structure .",
    "we have isolated 23 of these , and displayed them in figs .",
    "[ fig_h ] and [ fig_n ] , depending on whether one or zero higgs intermediate states are involved , respectively .",
    "there are 214 graphs of the first kind and 336 of the second .",
    "this approach , of splitting the me in ( non-)resonant subprocesses , facilitates the integration over the phase space and further provides an insight into the fundamental dynamics . on the one hand",
    ", one can compute each of the topologies separately , with the appropriate mapping of variables , thus optimizing the accuracy of the numerical integration .",
    "on the other hand , one is able to assess the relative weight of the various subprocesses into the full scattering amplitude , by comparing the various integrals with each other .",
    "however , one should recall that the amplitudes squared associated to each of these topologies are in general non - gauge invariant .",
    "in fact , the latter is recovered only when the various ( non)-resonant terms are summed up . for reasons of space , we will not dwell in technicalities any further here , as a good guide to this technique can be found in ref .",
    "( the resonant structure of the various subchannels ought to be self - evident in figs .",
    "[ fig_h][fig_n ] . )",
    "the qcd diagrams associated to process ( [ eeqcd ] ) can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig_q ] . in total",
    ", one has 120 of these , with only five different ( non-)resonant topologies .",
    "the integration in this case is much simpler than in the ew case and can in fact be carried out with percent accuracy directly over the full me using standard multichannel monte carlo methods .",
    "non - zero interference effects exist between processes ( [ eehhz ] ) , ( [ eeew ] ) and ( [ eeqcd ] ) .",
    "however , given the very narrow width of the higgs boson ( always below 20 mev over the mass range considered here ) , any interference with the signal can be safely neglected .",
    "furthermore , we will see that the dominant subprocesses of the two backgrounds have very different topologies , so one also expects their interference to be negligible .",
    "therefore , given that their calculation would be rather cumbersome , we do not consider them in our analysis .",
    "the large number of amplitudes can easily and efficiently be dealt with in the numerical evaluation if one resorts to helicity amplitudes . in doing so",
    ", we have adopted the helas subroutines @xcite .",
    "the algorithm used to perform the multi - dimensional integrations was vegas @xcite .",
    "numerical inputs were as follows .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath24 entering the qcd process ( [ eeqcd ] ) has been evaluated at two loops , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 mev , at a scale equal to the collider cm energy , @xmath27 .",
    "the em coupling constant was @xmath28 .",
    "the sine squared of the weinberg angle was @xmath29 .",
    "the fermionic ( pole ) masses were @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as for the gauge boson masses ( and their widths ) , we have used : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    concerning the higgs boson , we have spanned its mass @xmath36 over the range 100 to 150 gev and we have computed its width , @xmath37 , by means of the program described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses a running @xmath14 mass in evaluating the @xmath2 decay fraction .",
    "thus , for consistency , we have evolved the value of @xmath38 entering the @xmath39 yukawa coupling of the @xmath2 decay currents in the same way .",
    "we have adopted as cm energies typical for the lc the values @xmath40 and 1500 gev .",
    "notice that , in the remainder of this paper , total and differential rates are those at the partonic level , as we identify jets with the partons from which they originate . in order to resolve the latter as four separate systems , we impose the following acceptance cuts : @xmath41 gev on the energy of each @xmath14 ( anti)quark and @xmath42 on the relative separation of all possible @xmath43 combinations .",
    "we further assume that @xmath14 jets are distinguishable from light - quark and gluon jets ( e.g. , by using @xmath44-vertex tagging techniques ) .",
    "however , no efficiency to tag the four @xmath14 quarks is included in our results . also , the @xmath3 boson is treated as on - shell and no branching ratio ( br ) is applied to quantify its possible decays . in practise , in order to simplify the treatment of the final state , one may assume that the @xmath3 boson decays leptonically ( i.e. , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 ) or hadronically into light quark jets ( i.e. , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ) .",
    "finally , we have not included initial state radiation ( isr ) @xcite in our calculations .",
    "in fact , we would expect it to affect rather similarly the various processes ( [ eehhz])([eeqcd ] ) . as we are basically interested in relative rates among the latter , we are confident that the salient features of our results are indifferent to the presence or not of photons radiated by the incoming electron - positron beams .",
    "the total cross sections for process ( [ eehhz ] ) , at the three cm energies considered here , can be found in the top - left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] , as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the decrease of the total rates with increasing higgs mass is mainly the effect of the br of the decay channel @xmath49 , see , e.g. , fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "this mode is dominant and very close to 1 up to the opening of the off - shell @xmath50 decay channel , which occurs at @xmath51 gev . in contrast , the production cross section for @xmath1 is much less sensitive to @xmath36 @xcite . in addition , because reaction ( [ eehhz ] ) is an annihilation process proportional to @xmath52 , a larger cm energy tends to deplete the production rates , as long as @xmath53 .",
    "when this is no longer true , e.g. , at 500 gev and @xmath13 gev , phase space suppression can overturn the @xmath52 propagator effects .",
    "this is evidenced by the crossing of the curves for 500 and 1000 gev .    in practice",
    ", the maximum cross section for double higgs - strahlung ( [ eehhz ] ) is reached at energies @xmath54 gev @xcite . for higgs masses in the lower part of the @xmath36 range considered here ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath55 gev ( where the bottom - antibottom channel is unrivaled by any other decay mode ) , this corresponds to @xmath56 gev .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of the production rates of reaction ( [ eehhz ] ) on @xmath6 is higher at lower collider energies @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to illustrate the interplay between reactions ( [ eehhz])([eeqcd ] ) , we will in the following focus on the case of a cm energy of 500 gev , top - right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] , as an illustrative example .",
    "in fact , the discussion for the other two choices , @xmath57 and 1500 gev ( the two bottom plots of fig .  [ fig_cross ] ) , would be rather similar , so we refrain from repeating it .",
    "( also note that the signal - to - background ( @xmath58 ) ratio improves with increasing energy . )",
    "the rise at 500 gev of the purely ew background ( [ eeew ] ) with the higgs mass can be understood in the following terms .",
    "the dominant components of the ew process are those given by :    1 .",
    "@xmath59 , first from the left in the second row of topologies in fig .",
    "[ fig_n ] .",
    "that is , triple @xmath3 production with no higgs boson involved .",
    "2 .   @xmath60 , first(first ) from the left(right ) in the fifth(fourth ) row of topologies in fig .",
    "[ fig_h ] ( also including the diagrams in which the on - shell @xmath3 is connected to the electron - positron line ) .",
    "that is , single higgs - strahlung production in association with an additional @xmath3 , with the higgs decaying to @xmath61 .",
    "the cross sections of these two channels are obviously identical .",
    "3 .   @xmath62 , first from the right in the third row of topologies in fig .",
    "[ fig_h ] . that is , single higgs - strahlung production with the higgs decaying to @xmath63 via two off - shell @xmath64 bosons .",
    "4 .   @xmath65 , first(first ) from the right(left ) in the first(second ) row of topologies in fig .",
    "[ fig_h ] .",
    "that is , two single higgs - strahlung production channels with the higgs decaying to @xmath66 via one off - shell @xmath64 boson .",
    "also the cross sections of these two channels are identical to each other , as in 2 .",
    "the production rates of 1.4 . as separate subprocesses can be found in the upper portion of fig .",
    "[ fig_split ] .",
    "all other ew subprocesses are much smaller and rarely exceed @xmath67 femtobarns , so we do not plot them here .",
    "the qcd process ( [ eeqcd ] ) is dominated by @xmath68 production with one of the two @xmath3 bosons decaying hadronically into four @xmath14 jets .",
    "this subprocess corresponds to the topology in the middle of the first row of diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_q ] .",
    "notice that higgs diagrams are involved in this process as well ( bottom - right topology in the above figure ) .",
    "these correspond to single higgs - strahlung production with the higgs scalar subsequently decaying into @xmath69 via an off - shell gluon .",
    "their contribution is not negligible , owning to the large @xmath70 production rates , as can be seen in the lower portion of fig .",
    "[ fig_split ] .",
    "the somewhat unexpected dependence of the latter upon @xmath36 ( with a maximum at 130 gev ) is the result of the interplay between our acceptance cuts and phase space effects .",
    "the contribution of the other diagrams , which do not resonate , is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath8 and @xmath70 mediated graphs , with the interferences even smaller ( and generally negative ) .",
    "one should note from fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] that the overall rates of the signal are quite small ( also recall that we neglect tagging efficiency as well as the @xmath3 decay rates ) , even at low higgs masses where both the production and decay rates are largest . in fact , they are always below @xmath71 femtobarns for all energies from 500 to 1500 gev , although this can be doubled simply by polarizing the incoming electron and positron beams .",
    "thus , as already recognised in ref .",
    "@xcite , where on - shell production studies of process ( [ eehhz ] ) were performed , luminosities of the order of one inverse attobarn need to be collected before statistically significant measurements of @xmath6 can be performed .",
    "this emphasizes the need of high luminosity at any future lc .",
    "we now proceed by looking at several differential spectra of reactions ( [ eehhz])([eeqcd ] ) , in order to find suitable kinematic cuts which will enhance the @xmath58 ratio .",
    "the distributions in @xmath72 and @xmath73 leave little to exploit in separating signal from background after the acceptance cuts are made , especially with respect to the ew background .",
    "we turn then to other spectra , for example , invariant masses of @xmath14 ( anti)quark systems . in this respect",
    ", we have plotted those of the following combinations :    * of @xmath43 systems , for the case in which the @xmath14 jets come from the same production vertex ( ` right ' pairing ) and the opposite case as well ( ` wrong ' pairing ) ; * of @xmath74 systems , in which only two @xmath14 ( anti)quarks have the same em charge ; * of the @xmath15 system .",
    "we denote the mass spectra of the systems ( a)(d ) as @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 signifies the right(wrong ) combination ) , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . in the first three cases , there exists more than one combination of @xmath14 quarks . in such instances",
    ", we bin them all in the same distribution each with identical event weight .",
    "further notice that the @xmath43 invariant masses that can be reconstructed experimentally are actually appropriately weighted superpositions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath14 charge tag is available , then it is roughly the sum of the two . if not , the latter is about twice as large as the former .",
    "the invariant mass spectra can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig_masses ] , for the combination @xmath56 gev and @xmath55 gev . here",
    ", one can appreciate the narrow higgs peak gev one has @xmath80 mev .",
    "the higgs resonances in the top - left frame of fig .  [ fig_masses ]",
    "have been smeared out by incorporating a @xmath81 gev bin width , emulating the finite efficiency of the detectors in determining energies and angles . ] in the @xmath75 distribution , that can certainly be exploited in the signal selection , especially against the qcd background , which is rather flat in the vicinity of @xmath36 .",
    "apparently , this is no longer true for the ew process , as it also displays a resonance at @xmath36 ( induced by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_h ] which carry an external on - shell current @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , events of the type ( [ eehhz ] ) contain two @xmath43 invariant masses naturally peaking at @xmath36 , whereas only one would appear in samples produced by process ( [ eeew ] ) ( apart from accidental resonant mispairings ) .",
    "thus , even in the case of the ew background one can achieve a significant noise reduction . finally , requiring that none of the @xmath43 invariant masses reproduce a @xmath3 boson",
    "will also be helpful in this respect , as evident from the @xmath75 spectrum of process ( [ eeew ] ) .",
    "however , in this case , the invariant mass resolution of di - jet systems must be at least as good as the difference @xmath82 , in order to resolve the @xmath3 and @xmath83 peaks .",
    "other mass distributions can be useful too in reducing the noise while keeping a substantial portion of the signal .",
    "of some help are the @xmath78 and @xmath79 spectra .",
    "in particular , notice that the minimum value of the latter is about @xmath84 for process ( [ eehhz ] ) , whereas for reaction ( [ eeew ] ) it is lower , typically around @xmath85 or @xmath86 , as driven by the two dominant components of the ew background at low higgs mass ( i.e. , subprocesses 1 . and 2 .",
    ", respectively , see top of fig .  [ fig_split ] ) .",
    "the qcd background can stretch to @xmath79 values even further below the @xmath84 end point of the signal ( the more the larger @xmath36 ) , indeed showing a peak both at @xmath36 and @xmath87 , corresponding to the @xmath88 and @xmath89 decays induced by the second and last topologies in fig .  [ fig_q ] . as for the @xmath78 spectrum ,",
    "its shape is strongly related to that of the @xmath15 mass . in a sense , by excluding one of the four @xmath14 quarks from the mass reconstruction corresponds to smearing the @xmath79 distributions , so that the broad prominent peak at @xmath90 gev in the case of the qcd process can be viewed as the superposition of the remains of the two narrow ones seen in @xmath79 . for this very reason then , once a selection cut is imposed on one of the two masses , this is very likely to affect the other in a similar manner .",
    "the spectacular differences seen in fig .  [ fig_masses ] between , on the one hand , process ( [ eehhz ] ) , and , on the other hand , reactions ( [ eeew ] ) and ( [ eeqcd ] ) ( more in the former than in the latter ) , are a direct reflection of the rather different resonant structure of the various channels , that is , the form of the time - like propagators ( i.e. , @xmath91-channels ) in the corresponding mes .",
    "however , one should expect further kinematic differences , driven by the presence in the backgrounds of space - like propagators ( i.e. , @xmath92-channels ) , which are instead absent in the signal ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_hh][fig_q ] ) .",
    "this is most evident in the properties of the four - quark hadronic system ( d ) recoiling against the @xmath3 boson . as the internal dynamics of the four @xmath14 quarks",
    "is very different in each process ( [ eehhz])([eeqcd ] ) , we also study the cases ( a)(c ) separately .",
    "one can appreciate the propagator effects by plotting , for example , the cosine of the polar angle ( i.e. , with the beam axes ) of the four @xmath14 quark system ( or , indeed , the real @xmath3 ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig_cos ] , where , again , @xmath56 gev and @xmath55 gev .",
    "notice that the backgrounds are much more forward peaked than the signal .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that the qcd events are mainly due to @xmath93 production followed by the decay of one of the gauge bosons into four @xmath14 quarks . the @xmath8 pair is produced via @xmath92-channel graphs , so the gauge bosons are preferentially directed forward and backward into the detector .",
    "in contrast , the signal ( [ eehhz ] ) is always induced by @xmath91-channel graphs .",
    "the ew background ( [ eeew ] ) has a more complicated structure but is still sizably dominated by forward production .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath94 and @xmath95 is very similar to that of the four - quark system . in practise",
    ", it is the strong boost of the @xmath3 bosons produced forwards and backwards in processes ( [ eeew])([eeqcd ] ) , combined with the small value of @xmath38 ( compared to the typical process scale , i.e. , @xmath96 ) , that produces a similar angular pattern for all multi-@xmath14 systems of the background , regardless of their actual number .",
    "this is true for reaction ( [ eehhz ] ) also .",
    "therefore , all angular distributions displayed can boast strong ( though correlated ) discriminatory powers , allowing one to separate signal and backgrounds events efficiently .",
    "an alternative possible means of disentangling the effects of the propagators is to resort to the differential distributions of the above systems ( a)(d ) in transverse momentum , @xmath97 .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_pts ] , for the same @xmath98 and @xmath36 as the previous two figures .",
    "however , this kinematic variable proves not to be useful .",
    "in fact , the only discriminating distribution is the @xmath97 for all four @xmath14 quarks ( or equivalently the final state @xmath3 boson ) , and this only singles out the qcd background , a large fraction of which populates the range beyond 180200 gev . neither the signal nor the ew background do so and always look rather similar in their shape ( even in the spectra involving @xmath43 quarks only , once these are appropriately combined together ) .",
    "notice that two of the @xmath14 quarks in the qcd background originate from gluon splitting and are therefore rather soft .",
    "consequently , one expects the four @xmath14 quarks to be more planar , in the @xmath15 rest frame , for the qcd background than for the signal , where they are all the decay products of heavy bosons .",
    "we study this by plotting the thrust @xmath99 @xcite and sphericity @xmath100 @xcite distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig_shape ] .",
    "indeed , such quantities could prove useful in reducing the qcd background but are harmless against the ew background .    before proceeding to apply dedicated selection cuts",
    ", we remark that kinematic features similar to those displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig_masses][fig_shape ] can also be seen at the other two values of cm energies considered here and for other higgs masses .",
    "in fact , increasing the value of @xmath36 in those distributions mainly translates into a ` movable ' resonant peak in @xmath75 as well as lower - end point in @xmath79 and into somewhat softer(harder ) spectra in invariant mass(transverse momentum ) than at the smaller @xmath36 value considered so far .",
    "moreover , the @xmath92-channel dependence of the backgrounds , as opposed to the @xmath91-one of the signal , is more marked at higher @xmath96 values .",
    "finally , for angular distributions , a larger higgs mass does not remove the big differences seen between the three channels ( [ eehhz])([eeqcd ] ) .",
    "therefore , in all generality , following our discussions of figs .",
    "[ fig_masses][fig_shape ] , and recalling the need to economize on the loss of signal because of its rather small production and decay rates , one can optimise the @xmath58 ratio by imposing the cuts : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 in enforcing these constraints , we assume no @xmath14 jet charge determination . moreover , the reader should recall that the spectra of the four hadronic systems ( a)(d ) are all correlated , in each of the quantities studied above , and so are the invariant masses , transverse momenta and polar angles among themselves .",
    "the counterpart of fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] after the implementation of the above cuts is fig .",
    "[ fig_cross_cut ] .",
    "the effect of the latter is a drastic reduction of both background rates ( [ eeew])([eeqcd ] ) , while maintaining a large portion of the original signal ( [ eehhz ] ) .",
    "further notice how the imposition of the cuts ( [ cuts ] ) modifies the hierarchy of cross sections for process ( [ eehhz ] ) with the cm energy , as now the largest rates occur at @xmath57 gev and the smallest at @xmath104 gev ( compare to fig",
    ".  [ fig_cross ] ) .",
    "the @xmath58 ratios turn out to be enormously large for not too heavy higgs masses .",
    "for example , at @xmath105 $ ] gev and for @xmath55 gev , one gets @xmath106 $ ] , where @xmath100 corresponds to the rates of reaction ( [ eehhz ] ) and @xmath107 refers to the sum of the cross sections for processes ( [ eeew])([eeqcd ] ) .",
    "the reduction of both backgrounds amounts to several order of magnitudes , particularly for the case of the strong process , whereas the loss of signal is much more contained .",
    "the acceptance of the latter is better at higher collider energies and lower higgs masses .",
    "in fact , the poorest rate occurs for @xmath108 gev at the upper end of the @xmath36 range , where more than 90% of the signal is sacrificed .",
    "we should however remark that the suppression of the backgrounds comes largely from the invariant mass cuts on @xmath109 advocated in ( [ cuts ] ) .",
    "( in fact , they are crucial not only in selecting the @xmath36 resonance of the signal , but also in minimizing the rejection of the latter around @xmath87 when mispairings occur : notice the shoulder at 90 gev of the @xmath76 spectrum of reaction ( [ eehhz ] ) ) .",
    "the value we have adopted for the resolution is rather high , considering the large uncertainties normally associated with the experimental determination of jet angles and energies , though not unrealistic in view of the most recent studies @xcite .",
    "the ability of the actual detectors in guaranteeing the performances foreseen at present is thus crucial for the feasibility of dedicate studies of double higgs - strahlung events at the lc .",
    "a related aspect is the efficiency of tagging the @xmath14 quarks necessarily present in the final state of reaction ( [ eehhz ] ) , particularly in the case in which the @xmath3 boson decays hadronically . on the one hand ,",
    "given the high production rate of six jet events from qcd @xcite and multiple gauge boson resonances @xcite in light quark and gluon jets , it is desirable to resort to heavy flavour identification in hadronic samples . on the other hand ,",
    "the poor statistics of the @xmath18 signal requires a judicious approach in order not to deplete the latter below detection level .",
    "according to recent studies @xcite , the two instances can be combined successfully , as efficiencies for tagging @xmath61 pairs produced in higgs decays were computed to be as large as @xmath110 , with mis - identification probabilities of light(charmed ) quarks as low as @xmath111 ( and negligible for gluons ) .",
    "if such a projection for the lc detectors proves to be true , then even the requirement of tagging exactly four @xmath14 quarks in double - higgs events of the type ( [ eehhz ] ) might be statistically feasible , thus suppressing the reducible backgrounds to really marginal levels @xcite .",
    "one must also bear in mind that experimental considerations , such as the performances of detectors , the fragmentation / hadronization dynamics and a realistic treatment of the @xmath3 boson decays , are also important when determining what cuts should be made .",
    "such considerations are beyond the scope of this paper , and are under study elsewhere @xcite .    finally , the number of signal and backgrounds events seen per inverse attobarn of luminosity at @xmath104 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 gev , with @xmath55 gev , can be seen in tab .",
    "[ eventtable ] . of course",
    ", one could relax one or more of the constraints we have adopted to try to improve the signal rates without letting the backgrounds become unmanageably large . for example , by removing the cuts on @xmath95 and @xmath94 one can enhance the signal rates by about a factor of two .",
    "however , the ew background would also increase by a comparable amount and the qcd rate would do by a somewhat larger factor , of at least three / four .",
    "kinematic fits can also help in improving the @xmath58 ratios @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the overwhelming irreducible background from ew and qcd processes of the type @xmath114 to double higgs production in association with @xmath3 bosons and decay in the channel @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath115 , should easily be suppressed down to manageable levels by simple kinematics cuts : e.g. , in invariant masses and polar angles .",
    "the number of signal events is generally rather low , but will be observable at the lc given the following ` mandatory conditions ' ( some of which have already been outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    * very high luminosity ; * excellent @xmath14 tagging performances ; * high di - jet resolution .",
    "the requirement advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite of a good forward acceptance for jets may also be added to the above list , as we have explicitly verified ( though not shown ) that single jet directions can stretch in the double higgs - strahlung process up to about 20 degrees in polar angle .",
    "finally , beam polarization can also be invoked to increase the signal - to - background rates @xcite .",
