    "the duke storage ring is a dedicated driver for the storage ring based free - electron lasers ( fels )  @xcite , and the high intensity gamma - ray source ( higs )  @xcite .",
    "the high intense @xmath0-ray beam is produced by colliding the high energy electron beam with high power fel optical beam inside the fel cavity .",
    "the electron beam orbit in the storage ring not only impacts the beam injection and beam lifetime , but also , especially in the fel straight section which hosts the optical klystron fel , determines the quality of the fel lasing and impacts the flux of the @xmath0-ray beam  @xcite . maintaining good electron beam orbit is essential for high performance operations of the duke light sources .",
    "the electron beam orbit in the duke storage ring is measured by the beam position monitors ( bpms ) .",
    "this system was first brought into operation in 1998  @xcite . in the early days",
    ", the bpm measurement had been found strongly depending on the single - bunch current .",
    "investigations showed that this effect was the result of overloading of the bpm electronics modules due to the high peak voltage associated with a large single - bunch current . by employing cables with high loss in the ghz region ,",
    "the peak voltages were reduced , and the bpms were able to provide reasonable good orbit measurements for a single - bunch current ranging from 0.5 to 20 ma  @xcite .    in 2006 , a major upgrade of the light source facility was completed . in the upgrade ,",
    "a booster synchrotron was constructed as the full - energy injector of the storage ring  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the north straight section of the storage ring was overhauled for a new injection scheme and for hosting a new high - order mode ( hom ) damped rf cavity  @xcite .",
    "in 2008 , another key system of the storage ring , the longitudinal bunch - by - bunch feedback ( lfb ) system , was installed and commissioned for routine user operations  @xcite .",
    "benefiting from all of these upgrades , the single - bunch current threshold of the storage ring was significantly increased .",
    "for example , a 95 ma electron beam was stored in the storage ring at 600 mev in the single - bunch mode with fel lasing . in the two - bunch higs operation mode",
    ", the storage ring can be operated with a total beam current up to 120 ma , or 60 ma in each bunch . in these cases of high bunch - current operation",
    ", the bpm electronics modules would have fully saturated without additional signal conditioning , and were not able to perform meaningful orbit measurements  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high single - bunch current produces a very high peak voltage on the bpm pickup , which could potentially damage the bpm electronics .    on the other hand ,",
    "some operations need a low electron bunch current .",
    "for example , some experiments need a small @xmath0-ray beam energy spread , which is usually realized by running a high - current bunch and a very low - current bunch which does not produce fel lasing .",
    "some machine studies also need a low beam current , which sometimes is even lower than 1 ma . in order to obtain precise measurement of the electron beam orbit in a wide range of single - bunch current from about 1 ma to 100 ma ,",
    "the rf pickup signal must be conditioned to increase the bpm s dynamic range .",
    "low pass filters ( lpfs ) have been widely used in bpm signal conditioning .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a method using lpfs to increase the dynamic range of the bpms of the duke storage ring to maintain high performance of the storage ring and provide highly stable aiming of the @xmath0-ray beam .",
    "a preliminary study has been reported in a conference paper  @xcite . this paper first reports the measurements of two types of bpm pickups , button and stripline pickups which are used in the duke storage ring .",
    "then , it describes the details of the pickup signal conditioning .",
    "the dependency of the bpm readings on the bunch current is measured and reported in the later part of this paper .",
    "let us consider a relativistic electron bunch with a longitudinal gaussian distribution of its charges circulating in a storage ring .",
    "the beam current is periodic and can be written in the time and frequency domains as  @xcite , @xmath1 respectively , where @xmath2 is the averaged beam current , @xmath3 is the rms bunch length in the time domain , @xmath4 is the rms spectral width , @xmath5 is the revolution time of the electrons , @xmath6 is the angular revolution frequency , @xmath7 is the turn number , and @xmath8 is the harmonic number of the revolution frequency .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) indicates that an electron beam with a short bunch length has a very wide spectrum in the frequency domain . as an example",
    ", the natural rms bunch length of an electron beam with energy of @xmath9 = 1 gev and rf voltage of @xmath10 = 850 kv in the duke storage ring is 2.0 cm  @xcite , its spectrum in the frequency domain is comprised of a rich set of frequency responses from dc to ghz region .",
    "the electron beam can be measured by bpm electrode pickups with a proper grounding .",
    "interacting with the electromagnetic field associated with the electron beam , the electrode pickups can be used to measure the electron beam current and position . following the reports presented by g.  r. lambertson and d.  a. goldberg on electromagnetic detectors  @xcite",
    ", we revisit the signals from two types of bpm pickups , button and stripline pickups which are used in the duke storage ring .",
    "the measured pickup signal can be described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transfer impedance of the pickup .",
    "a button pickup is an isolated plate on the wall of the vacuum chamber .",
    "compared to the electron bunch length , the size of the plate is usually small .",
    "it has a dominant capacitive coupling and typically modeled with an equivalent rc circuit .",
    "when an electron bunch passes the plate , the capacitor experiences charging and discharging processes , the voltage across r is given by  @xcite , @xmath13 and the transfer impedance of a button pickup is  @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the resistance of the circuit , @xmath16 is the capacitance of the button pickup , @xmath17 is the effective length of the button , and @xmath18 represents the ratio of the image charge on the plate to the total image charge and is sensitive to the beam position .    a stripline pickup is a long plate with one end grounded on the wall of the vacuum chamber , and the other end connected to the processing electronics via an output line .",
    "the grounded end is usually in the downstream to the electron beam motion . in this case ,",
    "when an electron bunch arrives the upstream end of the stripline , a signal is coupled into the electrode and divided into two parts  one part moves toward the output line and the other part moves toward the downstream end . when the electron bunch leaves the downstream end , a signal with an opposite polarity is generated . after canceling the signal from the upstream , the signal moves toward the output line . assuming the electrons and the excited signals both move with the speed of light @xmath19 , there are two pulses moving through the output line separated by @xmath20 , where @xmath17 is the effective length of the stripline . also assuming the electrode characteristic impedance and the output line impedance are @xmath21 , the signal can be written as  @xcite ,    @xmath22    by fourier transform",
    ", we can get the stripline s transfer impedance  @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wave number of the signal .",
    "when @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a real number , and its amplitude reaches maximum .",
    "for this reason , this type of stripline bpm is sometimes called a quarter - wave loop device .    equations ( [ equ - bpmsignal ] ) , ( [ equ - button ] ) and ( [ equ - stripline ] ) indicate that the spectrum of a bpm pickup signal is determined by both the spectrum of the electron beam and transfer impedance of the pickup electrode .",
    "the racetrack - shaped duke storage ring is comprised of two arcs , the east arc ( earc ) and west arc ( warc ) , and two 34-meter long straight sections , the north straight section ( nss ) and south straight section ( sss ) .",
    "the storage ring driven oscillator fel is located in the sss .",
    "the nss hosts the injection kickers , rf cavity , lfb kicker , and other beam measurement systems .",
    "the arc lattice is comprised of ten fodo cells , including eight regular cells and one modified cells at each end  @xcite . due to the space limitation ,",
    "the sextupole magnets were removed from the original design in the arc , and the sextupole magnetic fields were realized by shifting the magnetic centers of the quadrupole magnets horizontally inward by about 2.5 mm  @xcite .",
    "consequently , this arrangement makes the electron beam have a large horizontal offset at the locations of the arc bpm pickups , causing them to have a significant nonlinear response to the beam orbit offset .",
    "thirty - three bpms are currently used to measure the electron beam orbit around the storage ring .",
    "three types of electrodes , 30.4 mm long striplines ( named lsl ) , 21.6 mm long short striplines ( named ssl ) and buttons with 5.0 mm diameter , are used as bpm pickups .",
    "they are distributed around the storage ring as shown in table  [ pickup_dist ] .",
    ".the distribution of the 33 bpm pickups in the duke storage ring . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to the test results in the previous section , it is difficult to measure the actual dependency of the bpm readings on the single - bunch current because of the orbit drifting due to thermal effects . in order to reduce the orbit drifting effect",
    ", the test duration should be as short as possible .",
    "this is realized by lowering the rf voltage to about 60 kv in our tests to reduce the beam lifetime , and thus to shorten the test duration .",
    "table  [ tbl : ib_orb ] lists the results of two measurements for the three types of bpms and the bpms around the electron - photon collision point .",
    "figure  [ fig : ib_orb ] shows the orbit changes of three bpms located in different sections as a function of the electron beam current . in the first measurement , a 28.6 ma single - bunch beam is injected into the storage ring .",
    "then , the orbit is recorded as the beam current decays to 4.9 ma .",
    "the duration for this test is 4.3 minutes . in the second measurement",
    ", the single - bunch beam decays from 31.8 ma to 6.4 ma , and the orbit is monitored for 3.5 minutes . in these measurements , the horizontal readings of the arc bpms significantly depend on the single - bunch current .",
    "this effect is attributed to the large horizontal orbit offset ( @xmath282.5 mm ) in the arc bpms necessary for using combined quad - sextupole in the arc .",
    "the measured vertical orbit changes in the arcs have similar amplitudes as the thermal drifts in this period of time .",
    "the orbit deviation with the single - bunch current in straight sections , for both horizontal and vertical directions , also have similar range as the thermal drifting in the same time duration .",
    "these results indicate that the dependency of the bpm readings on the single - bunch current is small in the straight sections , and thus has little impact on the light source operation since the fels and electron - photon collision point are all located in the sss .",
    "the duke storage ring is planned to be operated in multi - bunch modes to achieve a higher @xmath0-ray flux . to learn about the behavior of the bpms at different multi - bunch current and in different bunch patterns",
    ", a series of studies are performed using a recently developed beam cleaning method based upon the bunch - by - bunch transverse feedback ( tfb ) system  @xcite . in each test , an electron beam with 16 evenly distributed bunches is injected into the storage ring .",
    "then the stored bunches are killed one - by - one using the tfb system . the electron beam orbit and current",
    "are recorded before and after killing each bunch . in this test , a 100 ma , 16-bunch electron beam is evenly injected into the storage ring .",
    "the duration of this test is about 70 seconds , and the thermal effect induced orbit drift is small in this short period of time .",
    "figure  [ orb - curra ] shows the measured orbit changes as a function of the beam current in one of the tests , and figure  [ orb - currb ] shows the maximum orbit changes of the same measurement .",
    "the results indicate when the beam current changes from 100 ma to 80 ma , the maximum orbit variations are less than 4 @xmath29 m and 8 @xmath29 m in horizontal and vertical directions , respectively . at the compton collision point in the sss ,",
    "the typical horizontal rms beam size is about 370 @xmath29 m . with estimated 5% emittance coupling",
    ", the typical vertical rms beam size at the same location is about 80 @xmath29 m .",
    "these bpm reading changes are less than 10% of the beam size at the collision point .",
    "as the higs @xmath0-ray production is run typically with top - off injection to keep electron beam current steady , the stability of bpm readings is more than adequate for the @xmath0-ray production in the top - off mode of operation .",
    "the result also indicates that most of the measured orbit changes are within @xmath3020 @xmath29 m in both horizontal and vertical directions when the total beam current is between 100 ma and 20 ma , and the maximum bpm reading changes are less than 50 @xmath29 m in the current range from 100 to 6 ma for the bpms in the straight sections .",
    "the duke storage ring has a number of operation modes with the single - bunch current varies from about 1 ma to 100 ma . to obtain precise orbit measurements in a wide range of the single - bunch current , a method for conditioning the bpm pickup signal",
    "is developed to enlarge the dynamic range of the bpms . in this method ,",
    "low pass filters are employed to effectively reduce the peak voltage of the pickup signals , and make the bpm system capable of providing reasonable orbit measurements with a single - bunch current of 1 to 100 ma .",
    "a number of tests under different operation conditions are performed to check the performance of the bpm system with signal conditioning .",
    "the dependency of the straight section bpm readings on the single - bunch current is small , and can not be precisely measured due to thermal effects .",
    "the arc bpms show larger orbit reading variations as the single - bunch current is changed .",
    "but this has little impact on most operations of the higs and fels .",
    "the dependency of the bpm readings on the multi - bunch current and bunch pattern is also tested .",
    "the results indicate that multi - bunch current and bunch pattern do not significantly impact the bpm readings as long as the bunches are evenly filled and the total current is kept in a reasonable range ( 20%30% ) ."
