    "the primary variables in mhd equations are fluid velocity @xmath4 and magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "mhd model has widespread applications in thermonuclear fusion , magnetospheric and solar physics , plasma physics , geophysics , and astrophysics .",
    "mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of mhd have attracted much research effort in the past few decades .",
    "various numerical algorithms have been used in mhd simulations ; examples include finite difference methods , finite volume methods , finite element methods , and fourier - based spectral and pseudo - spectral methods @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two - dimensional , incompressible mhd problems are studied in terms of finite element approximations of the stream function - vorticity advection formulation .",
    "since mhd flow often develop sharp interfaces , adaptive @xmath11-refinement techniques have been applied in mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "finite element computations of mhd problems in three - dimensions have been reported in @xcite .    in the existing finite element discreitzations for the above mhd model , a standard pair of stable or stabilized finite element spaces",

    "variable @xmath6 , however , at least two approaches are possible when the fourth order term @xmath12 is not presented in the model , namely when electron viscosity @xmath13 .",
    "one approach is to use the standard edge element ( @xcite ) and the other approach is to use the lagrange element after replacing @xmath14 by @xmath15 ( @xcite ) . both these approaches will become more difficult when the fourth order term @xmath12 is presented .",
    "we may still replace @xmath16 by a biharmonic operator @xmath17 .",
    "but discretizing a biharmonic operator in three dimensions is challenging .",
    "it requires @xmath18 degrees of freedom per element if a conforming finite element is used .",
    "one possible way to reduce the number of degrees of freedom is to use nonconforming discretizations which allow weaker inter - element smoothness constraints but still provid convergent approximations . among the class of nonconforming finite elements for fourth order problems ,",

    ", we investigate mhd equations that contain both fourth - order term and second - order term . in the literature ,",

    "the above fourth - order curl equations also arise from an interior transmission problem in the study of inverse scattering problems for inhomogeneous medium , e.g. , @xcite .    in order to provide an appropriate framework for our analysis",
