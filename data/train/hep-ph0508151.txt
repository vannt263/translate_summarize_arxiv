    "although the top quark was discovered almost ten years ago  @xcite , many of its properties are still only poorly known  @xcite . in particular , the couplings of the top quark to the electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons have not yet been directly measured .",
    "current data provide only weak constraints on the couplings of the top quark with the ew gauge bosons , except for the @xmath3 vector and axial vector couplings which are rather tightly but indirectly constrained by lep data ; and the right - handed @xmath4 coupling , which is severely bound by the observed @xmath5 rate  @xcite .    at an @xmath6 linear collider with @xmath7  gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath8  fb@xmath9",
    "one can hope to measure the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) couplings in top pair production with a few - percent precision  @xcite .",
    "however , the process @xmath12 is sensitive to both @xmath13 and @xmath3 couplings and significant cancellations between the various couplings can occur . at hadron colliders ,",
    "@xmath14 production is so dominated by the qcd processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 that a measurement of the @xmath13 and @xmath3 couplings via @xmath17 is hopeless . instead",
    ", the @xmath10 couplings can be measured in qcd @xmath18 production , radiative top quark decays in @xmath14 events ( @xmath19 ) , and qcd @xmath20 production  @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 production and radiative top quark decays are sensitive only to the @xmath13 couplings , whereas @xmath20 production gives information only on the structure of the @xmath3 vertex .",
    "this obviates having to disentangle potential cancellations between the different couplings .    in this contribution we briefly review the measurement of the @xmath10 couplings at the lhc and compare the expected sensitivities with the bounds which one hopes to achieve at an @xmath6 linear collider .",
    "the most general lorentz - invariant vertex function describing the interaction of a neutral vector boson @xmath21 with two top quarks can be written in terms of ten form factors  @xcite , which are functions of the kinematic invariants . in the low energy limit , these correspond to couplings which multiply dimension - four or -five operators in an effective lagrangian , and may be complex .",
    "if @xmath21 is on - shell , or if @xmath21 couples to effectively massless fermions , the number of independent form factors is reduced to eight .",
    "if , in addition , both top quarks are on - shell , the number is further reduced to four . in this case , the @xmath10 vertex can be written in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proton charge , @xmath24 is the top quark mass , @xmath25 is the outgoing top ( anti - top ) quark four - momentum , and @xmath26 .",
    "the terms @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the low energy limit are the @xmath10 vector and axial vector form factors .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related to the magnetic and ( @xmath31-violating ) electric dipole form factors .    in @xmath32 production ,",
    "one of the top quarks coupling to @xmath21 is off - shell .",
    "the most general vertex function relevant for @xmath32 production thus contains additional couplings , not included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomvertex ] ) .",
    "these additional couplings are irrelevant in @xmath33 , where both top quarks are on - shell .    in @xmath33",
    "one often uses the following parameterization for the @xmath10 vertex : @xmath34 using the gordon decomposition , it is easy to show that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : anomvertex ] ) and  ( [ eq : gordon ] ) are equivalent for onshell top quarks and that the form factors @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are related by @xmath38",
    "the process @xmath39 followed by @xmath40 leads either to a @xmath41 final state if both @xmath42 bosons decay leptonically , to a @xmath43 final state if one @xmath42 decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically , or to a @xmath44 final state if both @xmath42 bosons decay hadronically .",
    "the @xmath44 final state has the largest br .",
    "however , it is plagued by a large qcd background , so we ignore it .",
    "the dilepton final state , although less contaminated by background , has a br about a factor  6 smaller than that of the so - called lepton+jets mode . in the following ,",
    "we therefore concentrate on @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that both @xmath47 quarks are tagged with a combined efficiency of @xmath48 .",
    "we perform our calculation for general @xmath13 couplings of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomvertex ] ) .",
    "we otherwise assume the sm to be valid .",
    "our calculation includes top quark and @xmath42 decays with full spin correlations and finite width effects .",
    "all resonant feynman diagrams contributing to the lepton+jets final state are included , i.e. besides @xmath18 production , we automatically take into account top quark pair production where one of the top quarks decays radiatively , @xmath49 .",
    "we impose standard acceptance cuts for leptons , jets , and the missing transverse momentum .",
    "a detailed list can be found in ref .",
    "we also include minimal detector effects via gaussian smearing of parton momenta according to cms  @xcite expectations , and take into account the @xmath47 jet energy loss via a parameterized function . since we are interested in photon emission from top quarks , we would like to suppress radiation from @xmath42 decay products , as well as emission from @xmath47 quarks .",
    "imposing a large separation cut of @xmath50 reduces photon radiation from the @xmath47 quarks .",
    "photon emission from @xmath42 decay products can essentially be eliminated by requiring that @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the invariant mass of the @xmath54 system , and @xmath55 is the @xmath56 cluster transverse mass , which peaks sharply at @xmath57 .",
    "in addition we require that the event is consistent either with @xmath18 production , or with @xmath14 production with radiative top decay .",
    "this will reduce the singly - resonant and non - resonant backgrounds .",
    "the invariant mass and cluster transverse mass cuts which are imposed to accomplish this can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most important irreducible background processes that remain after imposing the cuts described above , are single - top processes ( @xmath58 ) , and the non - resonant process @xmath59 .",
    "we calculate the irreducible background processes at leading order in qcd including the full set of contributing feynman diagrams using madevent  @xcite .",
    "the potentially most dangerous reducible background is @xmath60 production where one of the jets in the final state fakes a photon .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    it is instructive to compare the bounds for anomalous @xmath10 couplings achievable at the lhc with those projected for the ilc .",
    "the most complete study of @xmath14 production at the ilc for general @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) couplings so far is that of ref .",
    "it uses the parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gordon ] ) for the @xmath10 vertex function . in order to compare the bounds of ref .",
    "@xcite with those anticipated at the lhc , the limits on @xmath61 and @xmath62 have to be converted into bounds on @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] compares the bounds we obtain for @xmath65 and @xmath66 with those reported for the ilc in ref .",
    "we show lhc limits only for an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath9 .",
    "the results of table  [ tab : tab1 ] demonstrate that the ilc , with the exception of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , will be able to considerably improve the sensitivity limits which can be achieved at the lhc , in particular for the @xmath3 couplings .",
    "the lhc will be able to perform first tests of the @xmath10 couplings . already with an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath9 , one can probe the @xmath13 couplings with a precision of about @xmath69 per experiment . with higher integrated luminosities",
    "one will be able to reach the few percent region .",
    "the @xmath20 cross section with leptonic @xmath70 decays is roughly a factor  20 smaller than the @xmath18 rate .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the sensitivity limits on the @xmath3 couplings are significantly weaker than those which one expects for the @xmath13 couplings .",
    "the ilc , with the exception of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , will be able to further improve our knowledge of the @xmath10 couplings , in particular in the @xmath3 case .",
