    "the resulting critical central charges of these strings are found to be less than that of the superstring , suggesting the possibility of string theories with critical space - time dimensions less than 10 .",
    "this paper is the second of two papers examining the properties of the simplest such fractional superstring , namely the one with spin-4/3 currents on the world - sheet . the first paper in this series @xcite described tree scattering amplitudes of this string for states in the untwisted sectors of the spin-4/3 fractional superconformal algebra , and showed that they obey duality and spurious state decoupling . also",
    ", a specific @xmath0 ( non - critical ) model of this string with a three - dimensional space - time interpretation was constructed , where it was shown that the untwisted - sector physical states correspond to space - time bosons including the graviton and yang - mills bosons . in ref .",
    "@xcite a no - ghost theorem for these @xmath0 untwisted - sector states was proven .",
    "this paper examines the twisted sectors of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring . in section [ sii ]",
    "we define the twisted sectors in terms of the monodromies of the fractional currents with states in those sectors .",
    "we derive general properties that models having twisted sectors must obey using the methods of refs .",
    "it is found that there are two types of twisted sectors , which we denote by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , whose occurence depends on how a @xmath3 automorphism of the spin-4/3 fractional superconformal algebra is realized in specific conformal field theory ( cft ) models .    in section [ siii ]",
    "we show how scattering amplitudes containing one channel of either @xmath1 or @xmath2 twisted - sector states and satisfying spurious state decoupling can be constructed .",
    "various choices of physical state conditions in the @xmath2 sector are consistent with spurious state decoupling in the prescription for scattering amplitudes that we develop .",
    "presumably , demanding duality of four - point amplitudes will further specify the set of @xmath2 physical state conditions .",
    "the restriction in our scattering prescription to only two external twisted - sector states is due to the absence of an appropriate dimension - one vertex describing the emission of a single twisted - sector state .",
    "this is closely analogous to the situation in the `` old covariant '' formalism of superstring amplitudes @xcite in which , due to the absence of the faddeev - popov superghost fields , an appropriate dimension - one vertex for the emission of a ramond - sector state is also lacking .",
    "this analogy is made even closer upon consideration of the example of the @xmath0 model of the spin-4/3 string where the @xmath2 sector is found to describe space - time fermions . in this model ,",
    "discussed in section [ siv ] , the twisted - sector states are realized by a @xmath3 orbifold twisted sector of the @xmath0 cft . in particular",
    ", the @xmath0 cft is a tensor product of three free coordinate boson fields @xmath4 on the world - sheet which do not participate in the orbifolding , and an `` internal '' @xmath5 wess - zumino - witten model described by two bosons compactified on a triangular lattice .",
    "the relevant twisted sector arises upon twisting by a reflection through the origin of that lattice .",
    "some details of this construction are relegated to an appendix . in section [ siv ]",
    "we also calculate some of the low - lying physical states in the @xmath2 sector and compute a three - point coupling between two fermions and the massless vector boson of the untwisted sector .",
    "these computations place some restrictions on the choice of physical state conditions ; however , the precise set of @xmath2-sector physical state conditions consistent with duality of tree amplitudes remains an open question in this model .",
    "there are many other ways of twisting the triangular @xmath5 lattice , but lorentz invariance is invariably broken in the resulting twisted sectors .",
    "this follows from the fact that under the action of all twists other than the @xmath3 twist used to define the @xmath2 sector , at least one of the @xmath5 currents is not invariant .",
    "currents not invariant under the twist can not have zero modes in the twisted sector , implying that lorentz invariance is broken in these sectors . whether or not the states in various twisted sectors should be included in the string spectrum is determined by one loop modular invariance ; however , since the @xmath0 model described above is not a critical ( @xmath6 ) representation of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring , it is not expected to be modular invariant in any case .    in section [ sv ]",
    "we briefly describe a @xmath7 model of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring in which the @xmath1 ( as opposed to @xmath2 ) twisted sector is realized . unlike the @xmath2 sector",
    ", the @xmath1-sector physical state conditions are determined by the scattering amplitude prescription developed in section [ siii ] . because the @xmath7 model has only one flat dimension the resulting space - time physics is trivial .",
    "it remains an open question whether either the @xmath1 or @xmath2 sector is actually realized in a critical ( @xmath6 ) model of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the spin-4/3 fractional superconformal ( fsc ) algebra .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "the fractional currents , @xmath8 , and the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath9 , together generate the fsc chiral algebra , encoded in the singular terms of the operator product expansions ( ope ) @xcite : @xmath10 the first ope implies that @xmath9 obeys the conformal algebra with central charge @xmath11 , while the second implies that @xmath8 are dimension-4/3 virasoro primary fields .",

    "say a counterclockwise switch ) the only consistent phase that @xmath18 or @xmath19 can pick up with itself is @xmath20 .",
    "the phase that develops upon interchange of @xmath18 with @xmath19 can be taken to be @xmath21 .",
    "the group of automorphisms of the fsc algebra organizes the representation theory of its highest - weight modules .",
    "the order - six automorphism group @xmath22 of the fsc algebra is generated by the transformations    [ autom ] @xmath23    where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . since the fsc algebra is supposed to be an organizing symmetry of the states of the spin-4/3 string , it is natural to assume that its automorphisms extend to automorphisms of the cft representation of the fsc algebra .",
    "all states can then be assigned definite @xmath26 quantum numbers under the action of the @xmath27 group of automorphisms generated by the transformation ( [ autom]a ) .",
    "the untwisted sectors of the fsc algebra consist of the set of states which obey the bypass relations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a state with @xmath26-charge @xmath30 .",
    "the bypass relation @xmath31 denotes the analytic continuation of @xmath16 along a closed path looping once around @xmath17 in a counterclockwise sense as shown in fig .",
    "clearly the currents themselves are untwisted - sector fields with @xmath26 charges @xmath32 for @xmath15 and charge 0 for @xmath33 .",
    "we define the twisted sectors of fsc algebra representations in terms of the bypass relations the twist fields obey with the fsc currents .",

    "the phase in the double - bypass relation is chosen so that the @xmath15 currents have zero modes in the twisted sectors .",
    "indeed , the double - bypass relation implies that @xmath37 is a double - valued analytic function on the @xmath16-plane with branch point at @xmath38 and thus defines the mode expansion @xmath39    to further specify the twisted sectors we must also know the single bypass relations of the fractional currents @xmath15 with the twist fields . in general under a single bypass",

    "the single bypass relations ( [ twcurbp ] ) then imply the identification of modes @xmath44    there are some special choices for the @xmath40 currents ( or , equivalently , for the @xmath3 automorphism ) which lead to particularly simple twisted - sector properties .",
    "the first is the choice @xmath45 , where the @xmath3 automorphism group is trivially realized by the identity transformation . in this case",
    "we simply recover the untwisted sectors .",
    "a second choice is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",

    "the remainder of this section explores the representation theory of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors .",
    "we begin with the @xmath1 sector since it is simpler , and derive the generalized commutation relations satisfied by the modes of @xmath15 when acting on an arbitrary twisted - sector state .",
    "we then turn to the @xmath2 sector which is complicated by the need to specify the operator product algebra of the @xmath15 currents with their images @xmath40 under the @xmath3 automorphism .",
    "this depends , in general , on specific properties of the cft representaton of the fsc algebra in question .",
    "the @xmath1 sectors arise from choosing the @xmath3 automorphism which relates @xmath15 and @xmath40 to be an automorphism of the fsc algebra itself .",
    "there are three @xmath3 subgroups of the @xmath22 automorphism group generated by the transformations ( [ autom ] ) of the spin-4/3 fsc algebra .",
    "they give rise to three twisted sectors with bypass relations @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "( the @xmath1-sector `` @xmath51-disorder '' fields @xmath52 introduced in ref .",

    "this situation is closely analogous to what happens in the old covariant formalism in the ordinary superstring .",
    "there , dual amplitudes with spurious state decoupling can be formulated for scattering of neveu - schwarz sector states , and can only be extended to include two ramond - sector states as the `` in '' and `` out '' states in the correlator , thus losing manifest cyclic symmetry .",
    "so presumably , just as in the ramond sector of the superstring , our inability to incorporate more than two @xmath1-module physical states in our scattering prescription means that there is a nontrivial contribution to @xmath1-module scattering amplitudes coming from the `` fractional superghost '' fields on the world - sheet .",

    "this means that the zero - mode conditions ( [ pscr ] ) generate two _ a priori _ independent dirac equations for the physical state wave functions .",
    "this will lead to overly restrictive physical state conditions unless the @xmath15 intercepts are appropriately tuned , or only a subset of all the @xmath168 modes with @xmath162 are used as @xmath2-sector physical state conditions .",

    "the point is simply that since the @xmath170 and @xmath132 modes are not related in any general way in the @xmath2 sector , the associated dirac propagators are not equivalent  in particular @xmath171 is not proportional to the identity .",
    "in fact , one can show that the _ anzatz _ for the one channel @xmath2-sector scattering amplitude @xmath172 obeys spurious state decoupling , where @xmath173 is any fixed complex number and we define @xmath174 this follows from the fact that the analog of the commutation relation ( [ twiscom ] ) is satisfied for the above combinations : @xmath175 & = &      \\left(l_0+{n\\over2}-h_t\\right ) w^\\alpha(1 ) %    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\mbox { }      % % add line for galley      -w^\\alpha(1)\\left(l_0-h_t\\right ) ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we have a one - parameter family of satisfactory scattering amplitudes in the @xmath2 sector .",

    "the @xmath7 model is written in terms of two free bosons , @xmath330 and @xmath331 , satisfying @xmath332 and @xmath333 , with @xmath331 compactified on the unit circle @xmath334 @xcite .",
    "the vertex operators in the @xmath331-cft , @xmath335 for @xmath336 , have conformal dimensions @xmath337 , and carry the ( untwisted - sector ) @xmath26 charge @xmath338 mod 3 . denoting the dimension-1/3 and 4/3 operators by @xmath339 it is easy to check that the spin-4/3 fsc algebra currents are given by @xmath340 comparing to the expression ( [ grepd ] ) for the currents in the @xmath0 model , the important difference for our purposes is the absence of @xmath134 signs in front of the @xmath341 term in ( [ c2grep ] ) .",
    "this means that the automorphism interchanging @xmath342 is realized in the @xmath7 cft by the transformation @xmath343 _ without _ any accompanying reflection of the @xmath330 coordinate boson .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 sector states of the @xmath7 model are realized as states in the twisted sector of the @xmath3 orbifold of the single @xmath331-boson .",
    "acting on this sector , @xmath331 has its mode expansion shifted in the standard way , @xmath344 with modes satisfying the commutation relations @xmath345 = ( 2r/3 ) \\delta_{r+s}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath346 zero mode commutes with everything , and so can be taken to be a constant , which we set to zero .",
    "the basic vertex operators @xmath347 have the normal ordered expansion @xmath348 the normal ordering factors @xmath349 are required to insure the factorizability of amplitudes ( associativity of the operator product )",
    ". from this expression acting on an arbitrary twisted - sector state @xmath176 one obtains the bypass relation @xmath350 , where @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , the single - bypass relation for the basic fields are @xmath351 the last of which is precisely the defining bypass relation ( [ rbypass ] ) of the @xmath1 sector .",
    "( more precisely , this is the bypass relation of the @xmath58 @xmath1 sector ; the @xmath352 @xmath1 sectors can be realized by letting the @xmath331 zero mode take the values @xmath353 and @xmath354 . ) in general , these bypass relations imply that @xmath3-even fields have only integer moding , while the @xmath3-odd fields have only half - odd integer modings .    the twisted - sector ground state is non - degenerate .",
    "we denote the corresponding twist field by @xmath355 and the twist ground state by @xmath356 .",
    "the action of the zero mode of an arbitrary untwisted - sector operator on the twisted - sector ground state is simply @xmath357 .",
    "since the ground states satisfy @xmath358 for @xmath253 , a simple computation analogous to ( [ dimcomp ] ) reveals that the conformal dimension of the twisted - sector ground state is @xmath359 .",
    "all other twist fields are created from @xmath360 by the repeated action of the @xmath331 creation modes @xmath361 with @xmath362 .",
    "thus the twist states have the spectrum of conformal dimensions @xmath363 for @xmath162 an integer .",
    "acting on a twisted - sector state , the fsc currents @xmath15 have the mode expansion @xmath364 since the coordinate boson field @xmath330 is unaffected by the orbifolding procedure , its mode expansion is the usual one , as in eq .",
    "( [ xbosexp ] ) . recalling the form of the currents ( [ c2grep ] ) , we obtain @xmath365    the lowest - level state in the @xmath1 sector is simply @xmath366 .",
    "the non - trivial physical state conditions are    [ rtauzero ] @xmath367    consistency of ( [ rtauzero]a ) with ( [ rtauzero]b ) implies @xmath368 and @xmath108 are related by @xmath369 which is equivalent to the relation ( [ rintrelgcr ] ) derived from the @xmath1-sector mode algebra .",
    "the first excited state in the twisted sector is @xmath370 .",
    "the non - trivial physical state conditions are :    [ rtauone ] @xmath371    consistency of ( [ rtauone]b ) with ( [ rtauone]a ) implies the intercepts are related by @xmath372 although this is a different functional relation between @xmath368 and @xmath108 than appears in ( [ rintrelgcr ] ) , they have the common solution @xmath373 and @xmath374 , which is precisely realized when the condition ( [ rtauone]c ) is satisfied .    at higher levels in the @xmath1 sector similar physical states will be found , all with specific values of the intercepts satisfying the relation ( [ rintrelgcr ] ) . _",
    "a priori _ , there is no reason to expect all these states , or even an infinite subset of them , to have the same value of the intercept .",
    "of course , in one space - time dimension duality does not require the existence of infinite towers of states .",
    "we have thus shown that , to the same level of consistency , both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors can be realized in models of the spin-4/3 fractional superstring .",
    "it remains an open question whether either of these sectors is actually realized in a critical ( @xmath6 ) model of the fractional superstring .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank k.  dienes , j.  grochocinski , z.  kakushadze , a.  leclair , and e.  witten for useful discussions and comments .",
    "would also like to thank the center for theoretical physics at m.i.t . , and b.  zwiebach in particular , for their hospitality .",
    "the work of p.c.a . was supported by nsf grant phy92 - 45317 and by the ambrose monell foundation , and the work of s .- h.h.t .",
    "was supported in part by the national science foundation .",
    "we take into account the action of the @xmath259 zero modes @xmath224 on the twist states . in particular ,",
    "the twist ground state forms a representation of the nontrivial zero - mode algebra @xmath376=i\\pi$ ] , and so is degenerate .",
    "we denote this degeneracy by an index @xmath377 on the twist field @xmath243 and write for the twist ground state simply @xmath378 we choose these states to be eigenstates of @xmath379 ( the second component of @xmath224 ) : @xmath380 where , for the moment , @xmath377 can be any real number .",
    "the zero - mode algebra @xmath376 = i\\pi$ ] implies that @xmath381 and @xmath379 are conjugate variables , and that @xmath382 recall that the classical boson fields @xmath213 take values on the torus defined by the lattice identifications @xmath383 .",
    "this implies , first of all , that only exponentials @xmath384 with @xmath385 should be considered ( since they are single - valued on the torus ) , and secondly , by ( [ bdegen ] ) that we should identify @xmath386 where @xmath387 will be determined momentarily . note that since @xmath388 = 0 $ ] for integer @xmath389",
    ", @xmath390 is a constant .",
    "the fact that the @xmath389 are constrained to be integers means that for each @xmath391 and every choice of @xmath387 there is a separate , inequivalent two - dimensional representation of the zero - mode algebra , consisting of the states @xmath392 and @xmath393 .",
    "note that in terms of their @xmath379 eigenvalues , these two states differ by a half - lattice translation , as do the fixed points of the @xmath3 orbifold . in this way we match up with the familiar result that the number of ( ground state ) twist fields in an asymmetric ( chiral ) orbifold is the square - root of the number of fixed points of the orbifold action @xcite .",
    "note also that the existence of these infinite number of representations of the zero - mode algebra is a reflection of the symmetry of the vertex operator algebra which takes @xmath394 , where @xmath390 and @xmath395 .",
    "we now show that only three of these infinite number of inequivalent representations of the zero - mode algebra are consistent with the @xmath195 symmetry of the cft . in particular , the zero modes @xmath396 of the generators of the @xmath5 current algebra symmetry must obey the @xmath195 algebra @xmath397 =      \\varepsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}(u^\\rho)_0 .\\ ] ] using the definitions of the @xmath198 fields in terms of vertices ( [ covflds ] ) , and the identification of the zero mode of a vertex acting on the ground state as @xmath398 from ( [ twvtx ] ) where @xmath399 one can show , using the hausdorff formula @xmath400}$ ] , that the @xmath195 algebra ( [ bsoalg ] ) is satisfied only if @xmath401 acting on the ground states @xmath392 , using ( [ bzmreps ] ) and the hausdorff formula one can show that these equations reduce to @xmath402 where we have defined @xmath403 .",
    "the only solutions to these equations are @xmath404 where @xmath50 and @xmath405 .",
