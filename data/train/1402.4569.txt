    "<S> this is different from conventional bose hubbard model with quadratic dispersion , where @xmath103=0 $ ] and the @xmath53-term is marginal in two - dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling dimension of @xmath84 is @xmath104=-1/2 $ ] , and the @xmath84-term is irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> that means , in this case , although the momentum - dependent interaction plays an important role at mean - field level to shift the critical value , it does not play significant role for fluctuations beyond mean - field .    in this case , the one - loop renormalizaiton group ( rg ) equations are derived as @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 is a function of @xmath72 defined in supplementary material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the gaussion fixed point at @xmath108 , these rg equations give another non - gaussion fixed point at @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow diagram is shown in fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> however , since in this case @xmath100 does not receive any correction from interaction , the critical exponent of superfluid transition still remains as its mean - field value @xmath110 , as in usual bose gas case @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> case * b. * particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath111 @xcite . in this case , the scaling dimension of @xmath79 is @xmath98=-(5 + 2d)/4 $ ] and the critical dimension is @xmath112 . in this case , for a system in two - dimension , @xmath113 . since @xmath114 it is not accurate to treat the system by means of perturbative expansion @xcite . for a system with @xmath83 , @xmath115 , and </S>",

    "<S> these are all identical to the case . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case , the one - loop rg equations read @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is also defined in the supplementary material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key difference is that the @xmath100-term now receives correction from interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the new non - gaussian fixed point is located at @xmath119 , and the flow diagram is shown in fig . [ flow](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the critical exponent of superfluid transition @xmath120 is now different from the mean - field value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is also different from conventional bosons with @xmath121 dispersion with @xmath111 , which belongs to the class of @xmath122 rotor model . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , it represents a new type of critical behavior .        </S>",
    "<S> we note that in both cases we have @xmath115 , which is because the quartic dispersion gives rise to a fractional critical dimension . whereas in many systems where the critical dimension is usually an integer , @xmath123 is at least equal to one for a physical system below critical dimension . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath123-expansion is expected to work more accurately in our cases . </S>",
    "<S> previously , for conventional bose hubbard model the critical exponent @xmath110 has been measured with _ in - situ _ density measurements @xcite . in the system of shaking lattice , </S>",
    "<S> one can tune the interaction to the vicinity of mott transition , tune the chemical potential to the particle - hole symmetric point , and tune the band dispersion by shaking to the vicinity of ising transition . </S>",
