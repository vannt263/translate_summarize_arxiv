    "<S> let us imagine a scientist that never had contact with quantum theory and receives as a gift a stern - gerlach apparatus and a source of spin-(@xmath23 ) particles . </S>",
    "<S> this scientist observes that when she measures @xmath20 in different directions , the outcomes appear with some probabilities that depend on the preparation and on the directions that she chooses to measure . </S>",
    "<S> she observes also that some special arrangements of the preparation and the direction of measurement yields total predictability of outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if she prepares the particles s beam polarized in the @xmath17 direction and then measures @xmath24 , the outcomes are totaly determined . however , after trying a large number of possible different arragements of preparations and measurements , one inevitable question will appear to her : `` why is it not possible to predict with certainty ( probability @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) the outcomes of measurements in two different directions , for a fixed preparation ? '' </S>",
    "<S> there is in principle no rule that forbids her of obtaining , for some fixed preparation , the outcome @xmath27 with probability one in two different directions . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear then that there is some physical law that forbids this perfectly legitimate situation . </S>",
    "<S> the basic empirical evidence is that if one measures @xmath20 in a fixed direction @xmath19 and obtains @xmath27 with certainty implies that the outcomes of measuring @xmath28 in a different direction @xmath29 do not occur with total certainty .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion will be restricted mostly to two - level systems in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> an extension to higher dimensions is sketched in the end of the text . </S>",
    "<S> for a two - level system , the principle of complementarity reads :    for a fixed preparation , measurements of @xmath20 and @xmath28 in non - colinear directions @xmath19 and @xmath29 are not both predictable .    by _ predictable _ we mean that the outcomes of the measurement are totally determined , i.e. , one occurs with unit probability , implying the other have zero probability of occurence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , predictability means we can certainly know the result of measuring @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> principle 1 then states that predictability of a measurement in a certain direction precludes the predictability of a measurement in a different direction ; in this sense these different measurements are complementary . </S>",
    "<S> let us see now how the pc imposes bounds on the bloch vector :    for a two - level system , a preparation with bloch vector @xmath30 satisfies the principle of complementarity iff @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 orthogonal directions .    </S>",
    "<S> * proof : * appendix a.    observation 1 is equivalent to the usual notion of complementarity for the mach - zender interferometer @xcite expressed by the duality relation ( [ dualrel ] ) . it is also equivalent to larsen - luis complementarity relations @xcite and bounds given by entropic uncertainty relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is noteworthy that the preparations respecting the pc correspond to the bloch ball of preparations described by quantum theory .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that a violation of ( [ bound ] ) could lead to negative or greater than one values for ( [ blochprob ] ) for some directions of measurement , so we need to justify how to properly handle this situation . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that many directions of measurement give true values of probabilities ( [ blochprob ] ) : it is just a matter of having @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> when this condition is satisfied , there are no inconsistencies in the formulation . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we will not consider the results of measurements in the problematic directions with @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason is that it is not necessary - three non - colinear measurements of @xmath20 in allowed directions @xmath19 are enough to determine the bloch vector @xmath30 , without violating any rule of probability theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover this last situation refers more to an empirical question than a theoretical one @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ transformations - of - preparations ] ] transformations of preparations + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    before proceeding , we need to specify how to transform one preparation into another . </S>",
    "<S> we can greatly simplify the calculations that will appear through the introduction of the well - known operator @xmath38 where @xmath30 is the bloch vector associated to the preparation and @xmath39 is a vector composed by the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this operator is hermitean and unit - trace ; as shown in observation 1 , a preparation respects the pc iff @xmath40 , which means that @xmath41 is a positive operator and corresponds to a density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> if we identify a measurement @xmath20 with the operator @xmath42 then we can use the mathematical machinery of quantum operators to simplify our discussion . in order to see this , </S>",
    "<S> we define the projector @xmath43 ; in the optics literature these are known as jones matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it is trivial that @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the rule ( [ blochprob ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath46 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume then that the set of allowed transformations are composed by standard completely - positive non - trace increasing linear maps over the operators @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> an operation over @xmath41 will then induce an operation over @xmath30 corresponding to usual processes in a two - level system experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for example , local unitaries over @xmath41 correspond to rotations of the bloch vector @xmath30 and the matrix @xmath47 represents the addition of an extra two - level system with bloch vector @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the kronecker product of the individual matrices </S>",
    "<S> . similar translations of multipartite two - level systems operations in terms of bloch vector operations can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for preparations respecting the pc , there is no deviation from standard predictions of quantum theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation can be seen in this equivalent way as an extension of quantum theory in order to consistently account for a violation of complementarity . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the rule @xmath46 $ ] by itself does not rules out negative operators @xmath41 , since for many directions of measurements @xmath20 the values @xmath50 are genuine probabilities - and this is enough to make predictions about the system at hand . for two - level systems , </S>",
    "<S> observation 1 shows that the pc is equivalent to imposing the postulate of positive operators @xmath41 @xcite , while a violation of the principle would demand the abdication of this postulate and a legitimate use of negative operators to represent preparations . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that similar extensions of quantum theory in terms of non - positive operators have been employed to represent nonlocal boxes @xcite , for the construction of efficient simulation schemes @xcite , toy models of quantum theory @xcite and more recently to locally extend quantum mechanics in the formulation known as `` boxworld '' @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the maximal violation attainable by quantum states and measurements is the so - called _ tsirelson s bound _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by popescu and rohrlich @xcite , there are non - signalling probability distributions which violate tsirelson s bound and some even reach the maximum algebraic value @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical constructions can be studied in the framework of nonlocal boxes @xcite . in @xcite a representation of nonlocal boxes in terms of negative probabilities was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to our approach , there are restrictions on the set of allowed measurements , in such a way that negative values of probabilities are discarded . for researchers used to quasiprobabilistic representations </S>",
    "<S> , there is no surprise : as quantum states necessarily display negative probabilities in order to be represented in a classical framework @xcite , `` superquantum '' states display negative probabilities in order to be represented in a quantum framework . </S>",
    "<S> we use now these ideas and constructions in @xcite to show that violations of complementarity allow the construction of nonlocal boxes violating tsirelson s bound .    for a two - level system , any preparation violating the principle of complementarity enables the deterministic generation of a bipartite preparation that violates tsirelson s bound .    the full proof of this result @xcite is given in appendix a , but we briefly sketch the main ideas . by observation 1 , a preparation violating the pc has a bloch vector @xmath30 with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> then using the equivalent representation ( [ blochball ] ) , it is possible to generate deterministically the following bipartite preparation : @xmath60,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 are bipartite preparations displaying the same correlations of bell states in quantum mechanics . </S>",

    "<S> neverthless , through ( [ blochball ] ) we argued that our formulation is equivalent to an extension of quantum theory in terms of non - positive operators for the preparations . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt this approach in order to formulate complementarity for higher - dimensional systems , i.e. , we introduce an extension of quantum theory that does not impose positive - semidefiniteness on the operators representing preparations .    explicitly , our `` toy model '' has the set of preparations @xmath3 composed of self - adjoint unit - trace operators @xmath67 , the set of measurements @xmath6 composed of self - adjoint operators @xmath5 and the probabilities are calculated via the trace - rule @xmath68 where @xmath13 is the povm associated to @xmath5 ; it is noteworthy that within hilbert - space formulations the trace - rule is unique @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> let us introduce some definitions :    two non - degenerate measurements @xmath5 and @xmath70 are fully incompatible if they do not share any eigenstate .    </S>",
    "<S> this definition captures the intuitive notion that a measurement is always disturbed if it is followed by a measurement that is fully incompatible with it , independent on the preparation that is measured .    </S>",

    "<S> we mean that the outcomes of the measurement are totally determined , i.e. , one occurs with unit probability , implying the others have zero probability of occurence . </S>",
    "<S> then we state our version of the pc for higher - dimensional systems :    given a fixed preparation , the outcomes of measurements of two non - degenerate fully incompatible measurements are not both predictable .    </S>",
    "<S> this principle expresses the complementary aspect of fully incompatible measurements , since predictability of one quantity implies unpredictability of another quantity that is fully incompatible with it . </S>",

    "<S> observation 1 shows that a two - level system preparation satisfies the pc iff the operator representing it is positive semidefinite . </S>",
    "<S> if this equivalence would hold as well for arbitrary dimensions , then complementarity would be the principle explaining the quantum bounds on non - local correlations , by the results of @xcite . for higher - dimensional systems , </S>",

    "<S> hence , for higher - dimensional systems violation of the pc does not rule out completely preparations beyond quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , preparations that do violate the pc as formulated here are still able to enhance the tasks of distinguishability and cloning in the same lines as the two - level case ; the full argument is shown in appendix b. hence , violation of the pc is at least a necessary condition for performing beyond - quantum tasks .    </S>",

    "<S> it was shown that violation of complementarity is equivalent to : ( i ) the creation of nonlocal preparations that violate tsirelson s bound without violating non - signalling , in the framework of the chsh inequality , by using solely deterministic operations ; ( ii ) distinguishability and hence cloning of a plethora of non - orthogonal quantum states via deterministic protocols . for higher - dimensional systems the equivalence does not hold , but violations of complementarity were shown as necessary for the enhancement of distinguishability and cloning . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can see our results as giving even stronger reasons for complementarity as a major physical principle and we believe it is , if not the main reason , one strong argument ruling out superquantum phenomema in nature . </S>",
    "<S> an important open problem is how to extend the formulation of the principle for higher - dimensional systems in order that only quantum preparations satisfy it , which is a theme we are currently working on . </S>"
