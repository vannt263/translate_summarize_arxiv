    "the painlev equations can be seen as the nonlinear analogues of the classical linear equations associated to the well known special functions @xcite .",
    "they have been identified as the most important non - linear ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "although discovered from strictly mathematical considerations , nowadays they are widely used to describe several physical phenomena @xcite . in particular , the painlev iv equation ( @xmath0 ) is relevant in fluid mechanics , non - linear optics , and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since its birth supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) catalyzed the study of exactly solvable hamiltonians and gave a new insight into the algebraic structure characterizing these systems .",
    "historically , the essence of susy qm was developed first as darboux transformation in mathematical physics @xcite and as factorization method in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "moreover , through susy qm one can obtain quantum systems described by second - order polynomial heisenberg algebras ( pha ) , whose hamiltonians have the standard schrdinger form and their differential ladder operators are of third order .",
    "it has been shown that there is a connection between these systems and solutions @xmath1 of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 solutions can be grouped into several hierarchies , according to the family of special functions they are related with .",
    "this classification can be easily done for the class of real solutions @xcite , but it can be as well performed for the recently found complex solutions @xcite , which is our aim here . to do that , we have arranged this paper as follows : in section 2 we shall present the general framework of susy qm and pha . in the next section we will generate the real and complex solutions to @xmath0 ; then , in section 4 we will study the real solution hierarchies and we shall analyze the domain of the parameter space @xmath2 where they are to be found . in section 5",
    "we do the same for the complex solution .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 6 .",

    "it is well known that the first - order susy partner hamiltonians of the harmonic oscillator are naturally described by second - order pha , which are connected with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , there is a theorem stating the conditions for the hermitian higher - order susy partners hamiltonians of the harmonic oscillator to have this kind of algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main requirement is that the @xmath3 schrdinger seed solutions have to be connected in the way @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the standard annihilation operator of @xmath12 so that @xmath42 is the only free seed .    if @xmath42 is a real solution of eq .   without zeros , associated to a real factorization energy @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , then all @xmath45 are also real and , consequently , the solutions to @xmath0 are also real .",
    "on the other hand , if we use the formalism as in @xcite with @xmath46 , we would obtain only singular susy transformations .",
    "in order to avoid this we will instead employ complex susy transformations .",
    "the simplest way to implement them is to use a complex linear combination of the two standard linearly independent real solutions which , up to an unessential factor , leads to the following complex solutions depending on a complex constant @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) @xcite : @xmath49 , \\label{u1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the _ confluent hypergeometric function_. the results for the real case @xcite are obtained by making @xmath51 and expressing @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , as @xmath54    note that the extremal states of @xmath55 and their corresponding energies are given by @xmath56 recall that all the @xmath45 satisfy eq .",
