    "two different researcher groups are collected from two different database .",

    "secondly , we so obtain the @xmath0-index distribution by studying it for the distinct areas .",
    "the parameters obtained from @xmath0-index distribution fits are compared with the same parameters estimated by citation distribution fits and we conclude that generalized statistics produce a @xmath0-index distribution that corroborates the citation distribution differently from stretched exponential that points out more accentuated differences between these two ways of estimation .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the continuous limit of normalized citation distribution and we describe a deduction of the distribution of @xmath0-indices for a group of authors for the stretched  @xcite and generalized  @xcite exponential pdf s , which are confronted next section .",
    "the fundamental hirsch hypothesis  @xcite leads to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a constant , which is determined making a suitable linear fit . since the databases supplies the number of citations ( @xmath27 ) and the corresponding @xmath0-index of the @xmath28 author ( @xmath29 ) , with @xmath30 , one has an estimator to mean citation number @xmath31 and @xmath26 .",
    "collecting a sample of citations of all authors of a group , which we denote by @xmath32 corresponding to the respective @xmath33 authors , the estimate of @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath35 , is the simple arithmetic mean : @xmath36    similarly , an estimator @xmath37 for the coefficient @xmath26 comes from least square fitting : @xmath38that measures the slope in the linear fit of the plot @xmath6 versus @xmath3 .      one interesting pdf used to study the citation distribution is the stretched exponential pdf tha we define in the continuous case as : @xmath39one can estimate @xmath10 by calculating @xmath34 , which , in turn , is estimated by @xmath40 , i.e. , we can demand the condition @xmath41 , resulting in : @xmath42according to @xmath43 , the @xmath0-index pdf for the stretched exponential is : @xmath44 \\;. \\label{h_distribution_by_sornete}\\ ] ]    in section [ results ] we will show fits of the @xmath0-index histograms for the distinct analyzed groups using this pdf . now let us obtain another formula for @xmath0-index pdf by using the proposal of generalized exponentials .",

    "this method , although manual is an excellent filter to obtain data for brazilian researchers .    in many areas as computer science , the authors are ranked considering not only papers published in scientific journals , but also by papers published in important conferences . for sake of the simplicity , we concentrate our analysis in software engineering area by computing the @xmath0-indices and the total citations of the members of program committees of seven different conferences in a total of 600 researchers . for these authors ,",
    "we have used the harzing program , that computes the @xmath0-index based on google - scholar index . the choice to use google scholar instead of isi - jcr for computer scientists",
