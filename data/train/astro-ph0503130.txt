    "in our first paper ( @xcite ; hereafter paper  i ) , we have presented our numerical approach to the study of stellar collisions in young , dense star clusters with a broad stellar mass spectrum .",
    "it is based on the use of me(ssy)**2 , a monte carlo code to simulate the long - term evolution of spherical clusters subject to relaxation , collisions , stellar evolution and taking into account the possible presence of a central massive object @xcite .",
    "our main motivation is to investigate in detail the runaway growth of a massive object ( `` very massive star '' , hereafter vms ) during core collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter gfr04 ) .",
    "this provides a natural path to the formation of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) in a dense star cluster , or a seed black hole ( bh ) in a proto - galactic nucleus in paper  i , we presented a number of test calculations to validate our monte carlo code and compare its results for simple idealized systems to those from @xmath7-body , fokker - planck and gaseous - model codes .",
    "these comparisons established that we can reliably follow the relaxation - driven evolution of clusters with a broad mass function , all the way to core collapse .",
    "we also found good agreement with models of dense clusters in which mergers between stars create a mass spectrum starting from a single - mass population , thus accelerating collapse and leading to collisional runaway @xcite .",
    "here we use me(ssy)**2 to perform a large number of calculations covering broadly the parameter space of young star clusters . specifically , we vary systematically the number of stars ( in the range @xmath8 , using up to @xmath9 particles ) and the size of the cluster ( with half - mass radius values from @xmath10 to @xmath11pc ) , and we consider systems with low and high initial concentration ( king parameter @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "our work is guided by the main finding of gfr04 , namely that for clusters with realistic initial mass functions ( for which the ratio of the maximum stellar mass to the average mass is larger than @xmath14 ) , mass segregation drives the cluster to core collapse in a time not longer than _ 15% of the initial central relaxation time_. it is therefore expected that in any cluster for which this relaxational core - collapse time is shorter that the main - sequence ( ms ) lifetime of the most massive stars ( @xmath15 ) , i.e. , @xmath16myr , these objects will eventually collide with each other in the high - density core , likely in a runaway fashion . as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] , our results confirm this expectation .",
    "our work on the subject was inspired by the investigations of portegies zwart and collaborators who revived the study of the runaway scenario thanks to @xmath17body simulations @xcite .",
    "although many key aspects of the process were already known from older works ( in particular @xcite ; see paper  i for a review of the field ) , these recent @xmath17body studies were seminal in considering the effects of collisions in a cluster with a realistically broad imf .",
    "this demonstrated explicitly for the first time how mass segregation can lead to a collisional phase by concentrating massive stars in a small central volume and made it clear that the post - ms evolution of the most massive stars initially present can prevent the runaway phase by driving cluster expansion .",
    "furthermore , portegies zwart and collaborators showed that , contrary to the somewhat unrealistic situation in single - mass clusters @xcite , dynamically formed binaries , far from preventing the runaway phase by halting the central concentration increase , promote it , as many binary interactions lead to stellar mergers .",
    "as noted in paper  i and suggested by @xmath17body simulations with higher particle numbers @xcite , in a broad - imf cluster with @xmath18 , binaries probably can not form through 3-body interactions _ before _ the collisional phase is reached .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that our mc simulations probe a different regime from that explored by the direct @xmath17body approach .",
    "we consider systems with higher number of stars in the central region ( inside a few core radii ) . for this reason ,",
    "some of our most important results are only superficially similar to the findings of portegies zwart et al .",
    "in particular , in such large-@xmath7 clusters with a long initial central collision time , a genuine core collapse , itself driven by mass segregation , appears to be the condition for collisional runaway .",
    "the situation for systems with a smaller number of stars is more complex because there may not be enough massive stars in the central regions to drive such a core collapse @xcite .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    ", we present the simulations we have performed and explain their results . in section  3 , we summarise our findings and discuss avenues for future research in the field .",
    "detailed presentations of the runaway scenario , the physics at play , our numerical methods and test computations are to be found in paper  i.",
    "in this work , we consider the evolution of isolated spherical stellar cluster with a broad , realistic initial mass function ( imf ) , subject to two - body relaxation and stellar collisions .",
    "when not stated otherwise , we use a salpeter imf , for which the number , @xmath19 , of stars with masses between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for this stellar population ,",
    "the average mass is @xmath26 .",
    "there is no initial mass segregation . to investigate the role of the initial concentration of the cluster , we consider king models with @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( * ? ? ?",
    "we do not enforce tidal truncation because it was shown in gfr04 that this does not affect the central regions which completely dominate the evolution .",
    "we refer to gfr04 ( section  3 and table 1 ) for detailed explanations about the important physical parameters of such clusters and units . in keep with the tradition , when not stated otherwise , we are using the @xmath7-body unit system @xcite defined by @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( initial total cluster mass ) and @xmath29 ( initial cluster potential energy ) . as time unit , we prefer the `` fokker - planck '' time @xmath30 to the @xmath7-body unit @xmath31 because the former is a relaxation time while the latter is a dynamical time ; they are related to each other by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total number of stars in the cluster .",
    "as explained in paper  i , we conservatively use @xmath34 to determine relaxation times in this work . for king models ,",
    "the @xmath7-body length unit is close to the half - mass radius , @xmath35 for @xmath12 and @xmath36 for @xmath13 . the core radius ( spitzer87 , eq .  1 - 34 and paper  i ) is @xmath37 and encompasses a fraction @xmath38 of the total mass for @xmath12",
    "; for @xmath13 , these values are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "expressions for half - mass and local relaxation times are given in gfr04 and paper  i. we denote the initial values of the half - mass and central relaxation times by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "table  1 lists the initial conditions for all runs performed in this study .",
    "@xmath43 denotes the number of particles used in the simulation .",
    "we also give in this table the value @xmath44 of the time when runaway started for all runs in which a vms formed .",
    "we first establish the conditions for runaway formation of a vms using the simplest and most favourable prescription for the outcome of collisions , i.e. , assuming that every time two stars come closer to each other than the sum of their radii , they merge without any mass loss .",
    "with such a clean collision physics , one expects the runaway to happen provided that :    1 .",
    "core collapse , driven by mass segregation due to 2-body relaxation ( as studied in gfr04 ) , occurs within @xmath45myr _ or _",
    "the cluster is initially sufficiently collisional .",
    "2 .   the collisional cross section is a steeply increasing function of a star s mass , @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "what `` sufficiently collisional '' means is not easy to establish from simple principles .",
    "one may think that a sufficient condition is that the collision time at the centre , for a star near the top of the imf ( i.e. , @xmath48 for our standard imf ) , @xmath49 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tcoll_ini ] ) , be shorter than the ms life - time for such a star . but",
    "this does not account for the structural evolution of the cluster due to relaxation and collisions themselves .",
    "another condition is suggested by the coagulation equation ( @xcite ; see also the simplified mathematical analysis encompassed in equations 6 and 7 of paper  i ) . in the case of strong gravitational focusing",
    ", it reduces to @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the stellar radius ) , a condition always obeyed by ms stars ( but not during the pre - ms stage ) .",
    "if gravitational focusing is strong ( i.e. , for velocity dispersion @xmath53 ) , one needs @xmath54 , which is ( although marginally ) not satisfied by our standard vms @xmath55@xmath56 relation ( @xmath57 , see paper  i ) . in any case , the relevance of the second condition is not clear because it stems from a type of analysis which disregards the stellar dynamics , most noticeably the role of mass segregation .",
    "[ fig : runaway_plane ] represents the ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) plane in which are plotted , for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the conditions @xmath60myr and @xmath61myr .",
    "@xmath62 denotes the relaxational core - collapse time , when collisions are absent .",
    "the value @xmath63 is the average value yielded by me(ssy)**2 when collisions are absent ( see paper  i and discussion below ) .",
    "we also indicate the initial one - dimensional velocity dispersion at the centre , @xmath64 this is approximately correct for any @xmath65 value . by comparing @xmath66 with the escape velocity from a stellar surface , @xmath67",
    ", one can estimate whether gravitational focusing ( included in all simulations ) and collisional mass loss ( not accounted for in the sticky - sphere approximation ) may play an important role .    from this diagram",
    ", it is clear that only relatively small clusters may have @xmath68myr without being initially collisional ( @xmath69myr ) ; for this one must have @xmath70 for @xmath12 and @xmath71 for @xmath13 .",
    "this fact was not included in gfr04 , who considered only the @xmath62 condition .",
    "consequently , there are in principle more clusters which may form vmss through collisions",
    ". even though initial conditions with collision time shorter than a few million years are questionable , they are an interesting idealisation to pave the way to more realistic simulations of the collisional _ formation _ of dense clusters .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : runaway_plane ] the initial conditions for all simulations carried out with the standard imf and collisions treated as pure mergers or with the sph - generated prescriptions .",
    "we also indicate the outcome of each simulation , i.e. , whether a vms grew or whether the core collapse was terminated by stellar evolution of the massive ms stars before this could happen .",
    "we set the lower limit for successful vms growth at @xmath72 .",
    "this is a relatively arbitrary value which matters only in the case of the four simulations with @xmath12 , @xmath73 and @xmath74pc .",
    "these runs were computed with the same code and parameters but using different realisations of the cluster and random sequences . in three runs ,",
    "a star grew to @xmath75 before it left the ms ; in the fourth , only @xmath76 was reached . to determine the time at which the runway started , @xmath44",
    ", we look for an increase of mass of a factor 3 or more in a star more massive than @xmath77 ( the maximum mass in the imf ) within the last tenth of the elapsed time .",
    "this definition may seem contrived but is required to capture the onset of runaway as it would be naturally identified by inspection of collision history diagrams such as figs  [ fig : coll_hist_lowcoll ] or [ fig : coll_hist_hicoll ] . in practice @xmath44 is very close to the core collapse time one would identify by looking at the evolution of the lagrange radii .",
    "we followed the merger sequence to @xmath78 at least in most cases but , except for a few exceptions , did not try to carry on the simulation until the growth was terminated by evolution off the ms . with no or little collisional mass loss",
    ", each merger brings new hydrogen to the vms and allows it to survive until the next merger , see figs  [ fig:2tscales300k ] and [ fig:2tscales3 m ] .",
    "it is likely that , in real cluster , the growth will saturate through some process not included in me(ssy)**2 .",
    "one possibility is the depletion of the `` loss cone '' , i.e. , the disappearance of the stars populating the orbits that intersect the small central volume in which the vms move around , see section  [ subsec : loss_cone ] .",
    "another limiting mechanism could be that the vms can not radiate the energy dumped into it by collisions fast enough to keep its relatively small ms size , and instead swells and becomes `` transparent '' to impactors , as suggested , for other reasons , by @xcite .",
    "on the ms , a vms is not only dense enough to stop impactors but also resilient to disruption despite its radiation - dominated interior .",
    "indeed , the binding energy per unit mass actually increases from @xmath79 to @xmath80 for masses ranging from 100 to @xmath81 @xcite . in any case , we are here mostly concerned with detecting the onset of the runaway growth and leave the difficult prediction of its final mass for future studies .",
    "our work is limited to clusters with a relatively large number of particles : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , for @xmath12 , @xmath84 , respectively , because the mc code can only yield robust results when there are always at least a few dozens particles in the cluster core ; otherwise , one can not make a robust estimate of the central density , which is required to simulate relaxation and compute the collision probabilities .",
    "an examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : runaway_plane ] shows that , in general , the simple expectation derived from the results of gfr04 that vms formation will occur when and only when the central relaxation time is shorter than 20myr is borne out by the present simulations .",
    "however , for relatively small clusters ( @xmath85 for @xmath12 ; @xmath86 for @xmath13 ) , a shorter central relaxation time appears to be required .",
    "this is possibly a consequence of the dearth of massive stars in the central regions : with our standard imf , the number of stars with @xmath87 in the core of a @xmath88 , @xmath12 or a @xmath89 , @xmath13 cluster is @xmath90 or @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "although , over the time required for core collapse @xmath92 stars may come to the centre from distances much larger than the core radius , the dynamics of core collapse is driven by a small number of particles and the applicability of the standard treatment of relaxation ( and of the notion of 2-body relaxation itself ) becomes questionable .    for large clusters , in contrast ,",
    "we see that runaway vms formation may happen at sizes for which @xmath93myr because collisions occur from the beginning and accelerate core - collapse .",
    "[ fig : trunaway ] is a graphical attempt at quantifying this effect . on this diagram , we plot , for all simulations with our standard imf which lead to vms formation , @xmath44 , the time of runaway occurrence . using equation  [ 8 - 123 ] of @xcite",
    ", we define the initial central collision time for a star of @xmath48 as    @xmath94    where @xmath95    @xmath96    we take @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 according to our ms @xmath55@xmath56 relation . when collisions are treated as perfect mergers ( `` sticky - sphere '' approximation ) , a reasonable fit to our results for the runaway time is @xmath100 hence @xmath101 is approximately @xmath102 , close to the core - collapse time found in gfr04 , @xmath103 , for all clusters with a relatively long initial central collision time . as @xmath104 decreases",
    ", so does @xmath101 , first mildly and then steeply when @xmath105 .",
    "for very short @xmath104 , one has @xmath106 . in this regime",
    ", the core collapse appears to be driven by collisions rather than relaxation .",
    "this is made clear by comparing the results of two simulations of a cluster with @xmath12 , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and @xmath109pc .",
    "the first run ( ` k3 - 52 ` ) was realised with the usual physics , including 2-body relaxation and collisions but , for the second , relaxation was switched off .",
    "the evolution of the lagrange radii is plotted for both runs in fig .",
    "[ fig : lagrradhicoll ] . with relaxation ,",
    "core collapse occurs at @xmath110 . when only collisions drive the evolution ( run ` k3 - 53 ` ) , it is slightly slower , with @xmath111 , but is otherwise similar .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the transition to collision - dominated core collapse occurs at such a short value of @xmath104 and that @xmath112 is so long in this regime .",
    "to some extent , this is due to our definition of @xmath104 , based on the most massive stars in the imf ( @xmath97 ) , a choice which may not accurately capture the nature of the cluster evolution in the collisional regime .",
    "indeed stars much less massive also experience collisions from the beginning . using @xmath113 , @xmath114 to define @xmath104 ,",
    "one finds @xmath115 when @xmath116 . in any case",
    "this relation for @xmath101 only holds for sticky - sphere collisions . when the sph - inspired prescription is used ( with mass loss and merger requiring @xmath117 ) and for high velocity dispersions , collisions are less effective at driving core collapse and @xmath101",
    "is consequently longer for a given , small @xmath104 value , as is apparent on fig .",
    "[ fig : trunaway ] .",
    "although it is clearly only approximate , it is tempting to use equation  ( [ eq : trunaway ] ) to predict which conditions will lead to collisional runaway by assuming this happens if , and only if @xmath118myr .",
    "therefore we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : runaway_plane ] lines indicating this `` corrected '' runaway condition .",
    "one sees that , when the velocity dispersion is sufficiently smaller than @xmath119 , this condition reduces to the condition on the central relaxation time alone with @xmath120 . ] while at high velocities , one predicts runaway for larger cluster sizes than suggested by @xmath121 .",
    "however , the simulation results show the runaway domain for very massive clusters to reach still slightly larger @xmath59 values . some of this may be due to dispersion in the @xmath101 results ( see below ) but , by inspecting the run ` k3 - 55 ` , another effect is discovered . in this case , the vms star survives to at least @xmath122myr , despite its ms lifetime being shorter than 3myr .",
    "this is due to the combination of ( 1 ) the prescription used to set the effective age of merger products by following their central he content ( `` minimal rejuvenation '' , see paper  i ) , ( 2 ) the relation we use for the value of the core he at the end of the ms as a function of the stellar mass ( fig .",
    "3b of paper  i ) and , ( 3 ) for this particular simulation , the assumption of perfect merger . because the ms lifetime is nearly independent of the mass for @xmath123 but more massive stars transform a larger fraction of their mass into he on the ms , each merger amounts to an effective rejuvenation if no mass - loss is allowed .",
    "clearly collisional mass loss may change the picture in this very special regime but we think the most important shortcoming of the approach is to assume the vms to be on the ms . as we will see below , in most cases , the average time between collisions is much shorter than the thermal timescale of a ms vms so that it structure is likely strongly affected by collisions and our sph mass - loss prescriptions would not be appropriate anyway .",
    "the extension of the runaway domain to larger systems opens the possibility that proto - galactic nuclei without mbh may be subject to runaway formation of a central massive object , despite relatively long relaxation times .",
    "present - day nuclei have a size of a few pc .",
    "however , using equation  ( [ eq : trunaway ] ) as a guide , a compact @xmath124pc nucleus with @xmath13 needs to be at least as massive as @xmath125 to experience collision - driven collapse in less than 3myr . for @xmath126pc ,",
    "the minimum mass is @xmath127 !",
    "so it seems that this process may operate in galactic nuclei only if they are born very compact or concentrated .",
    "indeed for @xmath128 , one would expect all clusters more compact than @xmath129pc to complete core collapse within 3myr , independent of their mass .",
    "our results show a relatively large dispersion in the runaway time when evolution is dominated by relaxation , in which case @xmath101 should be very close to the core - collapse time found in gfr04 , i.e. , @xmath130 ( with little variation from one simulation to another ) .",
    "the present results indicate a slightly faster evolution , @xmath131 , which is very likely the consequence of the use of a different code values found with different codes , in the case of the collapse of a single - mass model .",
    "models with a broad mass spectrum are more affected by particle noise than single - mass clusters ( at a given @xmath132 ) and display more intrinsic and code - to - code variation . ] .",
    "the larger intrinsic dispersion is also a property of the present code , linked to the use of local time steps ; they impose a scheme in which the selection of the next particle pair to evolve is a random process .    following this overview of our results for the complete set of standard simulations ,",
    "we proceed , in the following subsections to a more detailed description of the runaway process based on a few illustrative cases .",

    "we can not follow this `` post - collapse '' evolution very far because our code slows down considerably when reaching the runaway phase , as the central relaxation and collision times plummet . furthermore , as will be discussed in section  [ subsec : loss_cone ] , it is likely that our way of computing collision probabilities applies correctly to the vms only at the beginning of its growth .",

[ fig : coll_hist_lowcoll ] , where we follow five stars participating in collisions , including the runaway merger product .",
    "the parameters of the cluster are such that it undergoes core collapse in @xmath155myr .",
    "only a few collisions happen before deep core collapse , at which time one star detaches itself from the rest of the population by growing in a rapid succession of mergers .",
    "two characteristics of this runaway growth are its steepness and the fact that no other star experiences significant mass increase .",
    "the initial central velocity dispersion in this cluster is @xmath156 , a value for which we expect the sticky - sphere approximation to be accurate .",
    "[ fig : coll_hist_hicoll ] is an example of runaway in a cluster which is initially strongly collisional . in this case",
    ", many stars experience numerous collisions and start growing from the beginning of the evolution .",
    "nevertheless , only one of these objects experiences a very fast growth at the moment of ( collision - driven ) core collapse . here",
    "@xmath157 but the escape velocity from a @xmath78 vms on the ms is @xmath158 , so gravitational focusing is still effective , producing the steep increase of cross section with @xmath159 required for runaway . because relative velocities are still significantly lower than @xmath160 , we do not expect strong collisional mass loss but the critical @xmath161 for merger becomes significantly smaller than @xmath162 , making mergers less frequent than assumed here .    to study",
    "which stars contribute to the build - up of the vms , we draw merger trees .",
    "four examples are presented in figs  [ fig:2trees300k ] and [ fig:2trees3 m ] .",
    "the first is for two clusters with @xmath12 and @xmath163 , the second for @xmath12 and @xmath164 . in each figure , panel ( b ) shows the case of a smaller , initially more collisional cluster . in all cases , we follow the vms growth up to @xmath165 . the cluster in fig .",
    "[ fig:2trees300k]a has @xmath166pc , leading to collapse in @xmath167myr , just in time to produce collisional runaway before the massive stars would have left the ms . in this situation ,",
    "typical of clusters which first become collisional in deep collapse , the merger tree has a very simple structure , with most branches lacking sub - structure : the stars that merge with the vms ( the trunk ) are not themselves collision products .",
    "furthermore , a large majority of these impactors have masses around the tip of the imf , between 60 and 120@xmath168 .",
    "these stars add up to 92% of the vms mass .",
    "the distribution of the number of contributing stars ( the tips of the branches , i.e. , stars that are not themselves collision products ) is bimodal with one peak between @xmath169 and @xmath170 and another covering the @xmath171 ; it reflects the mf in the central regions ( gfr04 ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with fig .",
    "[ fig:2trees300k]b , obtained for a much more collisional cluster with @xmath172pc , which enters the runaway phase at @xmath173myr . here",
    "most stars merging with the vms were themselves produced by previous mergers and the contribution of lighter stars is larger , although the @xmath174 range still contributes 78% of the vms mass .",
    "the cause of the difference is that , in the more compact cluster , collisions occur from the beginning , when the cluster is not segregated yet ; in the larger cluster , virtually all collisions take place in the high - density core formed by the concentration of high - mass stars .",
    "the two clusters in fig .",
    "[ fig:2trees3 m ] , with @xmath175 stars and sizes of @xmath176pc and 0.1pc are both relatively collisional , as required for this @xmath65 value and this number of stars to experience core collapse in less than 3myr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : runaway_plane ] ) ; thus , they exhibit complex merger trees . again , in the more compact cluster , low - mass stars play a larger but not predominant role , with some 90% of the vms mass originating in stars more massive than 60@xmath168 .",
    "merger trees for @xmath13 clusters exhibit the same general characteristics and variety .",
    "in particular , the same kind of bimodal distribution in the masses of the contributing stars can be observed , with more stars in the @xmath177 range for clusters with shorter initial @xmath178 .",
    "it is instructive to examine the various timescales involved in the runaway process .",
    "this is done in figs  [ fig:2tscales300k ] and [ fig:2tscales3 m ] for the same four simulations as in figs  [ fig:2trees300k ] and [ fig:2trees3 m ] . in these diagrams , we follow the vms , merger after merger , making use of two ordinate axis , one to indicate its mass , the other to monitor important timescales .",
    "those are the time to the next collision @xmath179 , the time left on the ms @xmath180 ( if the star were left to evolve without further collision ) , and the ms thermal relaxation time , i.e. , the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) time . the latter is approximated here by @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the luminosity of the star ( close to the eddington limit for vms ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) . from 100 to @xmath81",

    "however , in all but the first case ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2tscales300k]a ) , we stopped the simulation before the vms left the ms , when the average interval between mergers was still much shorter than the remaining ms lifetime .    because it corresponds to a core - collapse time just slightly shorter than 3myr , the first simulation of the four is one of the exceptional few for which we could afford to integrate until stellar evolution caught up with collisions , as indicated by the convergence of the @xmath187 and @xmath180 curves . in most other cases ,",
    "@xmath180 still exceeded @xmath180 by orders of magnitude suggesting many more collisions to come when we decided to terminate the simulation . from the merger trees and the curve showing @xmath159 as function of the collision number ,",
    "there is only little sign of a decrease with time , as massive stars that have segregated to the centre are progressively depleted .",
    "such trend can be seen for the runs with @xmath83 stars ( in particular if one draws the complete merger tree past @xmath186 ) , but is not perceptible for a cluster of @xmath175 stars whose central parts constitute a larger reservoir of massive stars .",
    "indeed among @xmath83 stars forming a @xmath12 cluster , there is only about @xmath188 of stars more massive than @xmath189 in the core .",
    "an essential result is that , in the vast majority of cases the k - h time is ( much ) longer that the average time between successive collisions .",
    "this means that the vms is unlikely to relax to thermal equilibrium , i.e. , to the ms after it has merged with an impactor and before the next collision . in principle , then , it may be kept in a swollen state by repeated collisions and our assumptions of ms @xmath55@xmath56 relation and continuous nuclear burning ( to set @xmath190 ) are probably incorrect during runaway growth .",
    "this suggests a very different picture concerning the evolution of the vms in the runaway phase and the termination of the growth .",
    "the vms may grow larger and larger until it is so diffuse that it lets the smaller stars fly through it without the ability to stop them , hence bringing back the `` transparency saturation '' @xcite .",
    "another important effect is that the central nuclear reactions are very likely switched off in a merger product which expands as a result of shock heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the stellar evolution of the vms may be suspended .",
    "of course these effects will persist only as long as @xmath191 .",
    "when the collisions eventually become rarer from exhaustion of stars to collide with or because stellar evolution from normal massive stars drives core re - expansion at @xmath192myr the vms returns to the ms and to nuclear burning . given the complexity of interplay between repeated collisions and vms structure ( itself determining the probability and outcome of further collisions ) , it seems impossible to make any simple prediction as to what the final vms mass would be when it eventually leaves the ms . in future works",
    ", this situation may be studied by combining a stellar dynamics code with on - the - fly sph simulation to follow the vms structure collision after collision @xcite . for the time being , these aspects have to be considered as one central source of uncertainty regarding the outcome of the runaway phase .    putting aside the possible complications due to the non - ms structure of the vms",
    ", we can look at the changes in the runaway process introduced by a more realistic treatment of collisions between ms stars , as allowed by the sph results .",
    "figs  [ fig : coll_param_lowv ] and [ fig : coll_param_highv ] show when and why the sticky sphere approximation may become questionable .",
    "these diagrams show the impact parameter and relative velocity for all collisions that happened in two cluster simulations , one with @xmath193 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coll_param_lowv ] ) , the other with @xmath194 ( fig .",

    "a large majority of encounters happened with parameters leading to merger according to eq .",
    "13 of paper  i. in particular , all collisions but one in which the runaway object took part were in this regime .",
    "they had relative velocities smaller than @xmath195 and would have produced less than @xmath196% mass loss @xcite .",
    "consequently , treating _ all _ collisions as perfect mergers is certainly a very good approximation for system with comparable or lower velocity dispersion , including any reasonable globular cluster . in the high - velocity situation , a significant fraction of the collisions ( featuring the runaway object or not )",
    "should have left the stars unbound rather than produced a single merged object , suggesting that using the sph prescription to set the impact parameter for merger may affect the results . on the other hand",
    ", most collisions occurred at less than @xmath119 and would have produced no more than a few % mass loss .    to assess the impact of mass loss on the runaway mechanism , we have performed a few runs for which we assumed that all collisions result in a merger with some constant fractional mass loss @xmath197 , varying the value of @xmath197 .",
    "we show runaway growth sequences for @xmath198 , 0.05 and 0.10 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3massloss ] .",
    "one sees that @xmath199 is required to prevent the growth of a star more massive than a few @xmath200 . as typical impactors have a mass around @xmath201 , it is obvious why a vms of @xmath78 can only be grown through a sequence of merger if @xmath202 . the fact that we assume all mass lost to originate from the hydrogen envelopes also shortens the remaining ms lifetime of the collision product and prevents reaching @xmath203 .",
    "sph simulations show mass loss of at most a few percent for @xmath204 , so reaching @xmath205 ( on average ) would require really extreme conditions . the cluster with the highest velocity dispersion for which we have performed a simulation using the sph prescriptions is model ` k3 - 51 ` , with @xmath206 .",
    "it has the same parameters as the sticky - sphere run ` k3 - 61 ` and we obtain the runaway vms growth in a qualitatively similar fashion , although about 4 times more collisions are required to attain a given @xmath159 .",
    "the most noticeable difference is that the time required to enter the runaway phase @xmath101 is also about 4 times longer than in the sticky - sphere approximation ( see left - most open triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : trunaway ] ) .",
    "this is obviously a consequence of the collisions being about 4 times less efficient at driving collapse in this collision - dominated cluster . in cases with lower velocity dispersion , using the sph prescription make very little change to the conditions required to achieve fast collapse and collisional runaway or to the runaway itself .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_dmcoll ] , we plot the cumulative fractional mass loss for all collisions that took place in four simulations for clusters with initial central velocity dispersions ranging from @xmath207 to 1420@xmath208 .",
    "we see that all collisions yield @xmath209% for @xmath210 with an average @xmath211% . the cluster with the highest @xmath66 experiences a few completely disruptive collisions but only involving stars less massive than @xmath212 . even in this extreme case",
    ", @xmath213 is only of order 5% . for collisions involving a star more massive than @xmath48 ,",
    "the average mass loss is as low as 0.3% .",
    "the only case for which we find a qualitatively different evolution when using sph - generated collision recipes instead of pure mergers , is for @xmath12 , @xmath214 and @xmath215pc . in ` k3 - 55 ` , assuming pure mergers , we found runway , thanks to collisional rejuvenation that kept the vms on the ms for more than @xmath216myr . with collisional mass loss and a large fraction of collisions not resulting in mergers , the ( orderly ) growth of stars stopped at @xmath217myr , before any runaway star detached from the mass spectrum ( runs ` k3 - 65 ` and ` k3 - 56 ` ) .",
    "because a realistic treatment of collisions has so little impact on most results pertaining to the cluster evolution and runaway vms growth , it is no surprise that we find them essentially unchanged if , instead of our sph - based prescription , we implement the simple fitting formulae published by @xcite , which were derived from a smaller set of sph simulations .",

    "if the average stellar mass is as high as @xmath245 , the number of stars in that cluster is of order @xmath246 , too small for robust mc treatment with a broad imf and @xmath247 .",
    "we note , however that the condition for runaway suggested by gfr04 , @xmath248myr , predicts that many more of the mgg-11 models considered by @xcite should have experienced collisional runaway ( see fig .  [",

    "this disagreement indicates again that our simple @xmath62 criterion only applies to systems containing a sufficiently large number of stars . in particular , for relatively low @xmath249",
    ", binaries can form through three - body processes and suspend core collapse before collisions occur .",
    "furthermore , systems of very high concentration and ( relatively ) low number of stars , contain a very low number of high - mass stars in their core , initially .",
    "hence , a clean mass - segregation - induced core collapse of the type found in our mc simulations may not be possible .",
    "the mc treatment of collisions is based on the assumption that the two neighbouring particles picked up at a given step as potential collision partners are members of the same ( local ) distribution . in this approach",
    ", one does not actually test whether the orbits of the two particles would lead them to collide with each other .",
    "instead , it is based on the average collision probability between such stars in an imaginary volume over which the properties of the stellar population ( density , mass spectrum , velocity distributions  ) should be homogeneous . for this method to yield accurate collision rates",
    ", the cluster properties must be relatively constant over the range of radii used to estimate the local stellar density . a more subtle condition , in cases where one particle has unique properties and",
    "can not be thought of as a typical member of some continuous distribution , is that its orbit should allow it to explore a significant fraction of this imaginary volume ( for which the stellar density and collisions times are computed ) so that its collision probability is also relatively homogeneous .",
    "unfortunately , these conditions may cease to be fulfilled when the runaway star has grown to such a mass that it basically stays at the centre of the cluster with little radial motion in comparison with the size of the orbits of nearby stars .",
    "the situation then becomes similar to that of a massive ( or intermediate - mass ) black hole at a the centre of a galactic nucleus ( or globular cluster ) .",
    "while the vms grows by merging with stars coming into physical contact with it , the ( i)mbh destroys stars venturing into the roche zone and accretes ( some of ) their material . in both cases , stars must come very close to the cluster centre , i.e. , have very small pericentre distance @xmath250 , so the collision or disruption rate is dominated by stars on high - eccentricity orbits .",
    "how these orbits are repopulated by 2-body relaxation is known as the `` loss - cone replenishment problem '' @xcite .",
    "the basic difficulty is that relaxation may cause large relative changes in @xmath250 in only a small fraction of the relaxation time , i.e. , the time over which the energy of the orbit would be strongly affected . to give an illustration , for a keplerian orbit of eccentricity @xmath251 , the `` pericentre relaxation time '' is of order @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the usual ( energy ) relaxation time . let @xmath254 be the orbital period of the star ( from one pericentre passage to the next ) . for regions of phase space where @xmath255 , the loss cone is empty , while in the opposite regime it is full ( since relaxation replenishes loss - cone orbits as quickly as stars are removed through interactions with the central object ) .",
    "according to standard loss - cone theory , in most situations , the disruption rate is dominated by stars at the boundary between the two regimes .",
    "hence , to include loss - cone physics correctly into stellar dynamical models , one should in principle resolve the effects of relaxation on timescales much shorter than @xmath253 , actually as short as @xmath254 for stars in the critical regime .",
    "the mc scheme used here does not allow this directly because the time step @xmath256 of a given particle can only be a function of its present radial position @xmath56 , not of its eccentricity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath257 must be an increasing function of @xmath56 so that setting @xmath258 at any given @xmath56 would impose time steps at least as short as this for all particles interior to @xmath56 . to handle the loss - cone problem in a satisfying way despite of this , an approximate treatment of the effect of relaxation on timescales shorter than @xmath256 has been devised ; it is described in detail in @xcite . but",
    "this approach , as all standard loss - cone theories , is based on the assumption that the central object is rigorously fixed at @xmath259 ; in other terms , no account is made of its `` wandering '' through brownian motion .    in summary ,",
    "our present code allows us to follow the growth of a vms using two opposite simplifying assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) the `` standard collisional treatment '' which computes collision probabilities with the `` @xmath260 '' formula assuming a small central homogeneous box , ignoring small - number effects and the small amplitude of the vms motion . ( 2 )",
    "the `` loss - cone approach '' which neglects this motion altogether but looks at the possibility of collision between the vms and a given star with ( approximate ) account of the specific orbit of the star and its evolution ( due to relaxation ) on appropriately small timescales .",
    "a limitation of the second approach , as implemented in the mc code is that it only works for interactions with the central object leading to disappearance of the star in one pericentre passage . in consequence , here",
    ", we can only allow mergers but not fly - by collisions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_comp ] , a comparison is made of the results of both treatments for a cluster with @xmath13 , @xmath261 and @xmath262pc .",
    "obviously , after the first few collisions , the growth of the vms becomes much slower with the loss - cone approach , probably as a result of loss - cone orbits being rapidly depleted in the innermost region .",
    "in this situation , stellar evolution has a chance to catch up with mergers and to terminate the growth of the vms as the interval of time between successive collisions decreases . for this particular cluster model ,",
    "when stellar evolution is allowed , the runaway star still grows to more than @xmath263 before it leaves the ms ( models ` k8 - 16 ` and ` k8 - 17 ` ) .",
    "this happens around @xmath264myr but , thanks to collisional rejuvenation , the effective age of the vms ( its ms lifetime ) is only 1.4myr . if the collision rate is so reduced after the onset of runaway growth , clusters which experience core collapse within just a little less than 3myr can probably not form a vms more massive than a few hundred @xmath148 before growth is interrupted by the evolution of the vms or normal high - mass stars off the ms .",
    "the correct vms growth rate , assuming the same @xmath55@xmath56 relation and collision physics , is very likely between what is found with our two different treatments of the central object .",
    "which approach is the most accurate is difficult to tell .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "considering length scales pertaining to the interactions of the vms with the cluster indicates that they take place in a complex regime .",
    "we take as an example , simulation ` k8 - 29 ` for which we have the best data about the central conditions in the runaway phase .",
    "the mc simulation indicates that the vms has a wandering radius @xmath265 of a few @xmath266 ( in @xmath7-body units or pc ) by the time it has grown heavier than @xmath78 .",
    "this value is in agreement with a simple analysis based on the assumption of energy equipartition with the surrounding stars , @xmath267 , with @xmath268 , and equal amount of kinetic and potential energy in the cuspy density background of these stars , @xmath269 .",
    "however , even though the motion of a massive object in a background of lighter particles interacting with it gravitationally obeys energy equipartition approximately @xcite , the energy dissipation introduced by collisions can lead to non - equipartition , so the agreement may be fortuitous . in any case , the wandering radius of the vms is still much larger than its radius ( @xmath270pc ) so it can not , in principle , be considered strictly fixed at the centre . on the other hand , the central number density ( estimated inside @xmath271 for 18 successive snapshots )",
    "is @xmath272 , corresponding to an average distance between stars of @xmath273 and the influence radius of the vms is formally @xmath274 @xcite .",
    "these scales are significantly larger than @xmath265 , pointing to the breakdown of our standard collision treatment already when @xmath275 .",
    "the two approaches we have tried make strong simplifications of a situation that can probably only be treated correctly by direct orbital integration using , for instance , some hybrid numerical code in which the central region of the cluster is integrated with a direct @xmath7-body scheme , while the outer region is modelled in the fp approximation .",
    "this work is a continuation of our study of the dynamical evolution of young , dense stellar clusters .",
    "our goal is to determine under which conditions an imbh can form at the centre of such systems .",
    "we are exploring the collisional runaway route .",
    "this scenario applies to clusters in which the accumulation of massive main - sequence stars ( @xmath276 ) at the centre , through the relaxation - driven process of mass segregation , leads to the spitzer instability , thus triggering core collapse , before these stars evolve to become compact objects , i.e. , within @xmath16myr . as the central density of massive stars increases and their velocity dispersion decreases , direct collisions between stars must occur , leading to the possibility of successive mergers and the runaway formation of one very massive star ( vms , @xmath277 ) .",

    "taking advantage of the statistical nature of the mc algorithm , our code scales physical processes so that each particle may represent a given ( fixed ) number of stars , not necessarily one .",

    "furthermore , for very massive clusters ( @xmath283 ) , the core collapse is facilitated ( and sometimes driven ) by collisions themselves , an effect which extends the runaway domain to clusters of larger size than predicted by an analysis based solely on relaxation .",
    "such systems have velocity dispersions in excess of @xmath284 but we find that the collisional mass loss and the reduced merger cross section can not prevent runaway , even at @xmath285 .",
    "we never observe the formation of more than one vms . only in clusters that are initially collisional",
    "do collisions produce a high - mass tail in the stellar mass spectrum .",
    "most of the mass eventually incorporated into the vms originates in stars near the top of the imf .",
    "typically , for clusters that are not initially collisional , @xmath286% of the vms mass is contributed by stars in the @xmath174 range .",
    "this is due to the larger cross section of massive stars and , more importantly , to the fact that collisions take place in the collapsed core , which is dominated by these stars . in such clusters , most stars that experience a collision",
    "do so only once , namely when they merge with the growing vms . in very dense clusters where collisions are happening from the beginning of the evolution ,",
    "the contribution of lighter stars is slightly higher and a significant fraction of stars that merge with the vms have experienced at least one previous collision .",
    "changing the parameters of the imf modifies the condition for rapid core collapse but has little qualitative effect on the runaway process itself .",
    "in particular , clusters with a field kroupa imf @xcite , which has an exponent @xmath287 for massive stars , do experience runaway in essentially the same way as those with a salpeter imf ( @xmath23 ) , despite a much smaller total number of massive stars .",
    "if the upper cutoff of the imf is significantly lower than the assumed @xmath288 , core collapse will take longer but for @xmath289 , this is over - compensated by a longer ms lifetime . from one simulation we performed for @xmath290 , we predict that the region of parameter space leading to runaway is similar to what we found for @xmath288 .",
    "we found that in most circumstances , once the runaway has started , the average time between successive mergers becomes much shorter than the ms thermal relaxation timescale for the vms , @xmath183 .",
    "hence , its structure and response to further collisions may be greatly affected by its prior collision history .",
    "modelling the complex interplay between stellar dynamics , collisions , stellar structure and stellar evolution which should eventually determine the final mass of the vms is presently not possible . among the effects with potentially strong bearing on the runaway process is the depletion of loss - cone orbits that may come into play before the vms has reached @xmath291 as , being more massive than surrounding stars , it becomes confined to a very small central region of the cluster .",
    "assuming a strictly fixed central object and using the approximate treatment of loss - cone physics built into our mc code ( for the study of massive black holes in galactic nuclei ) , we have found a significant reduction in the vms growth rate ( after the first @xmath292 mergers ) but , in the few cases considered , the vms still grew to a few thousand @xmath148 before evolving off the ms and the average time between collisions , although @xmath293 times longer , remained below @xmath183 most of the time .",
    "our simulations allow us to establish the conditions for the onset of runaway collisions and to study the early vms growth .",
    "if globular clusters are formed with a concentration equal or higher than a @xmath13 king model ( and if primordial binaries can not prevent the runaway process ) , a significant fraction ( @xmath294% , see fig .  1 of paper  i )",
    "may experience this phase in the first few million years of their dynamical evolution .",
    "typically , a cluster containing @xmath295 stars at this concentration needs to have a half - mass radius smaller than @xmath296pc to experience runaway , but a proto - galactic nucleus with @xmath297 stars has to be more compact than @xmath298pc .",
    "many aspects of the runaway collision scenario and how we have approached it in our numerical simulations have been discussed already . in particular , the choice of physical ingredients considered and the uncertainties and simplifications involved in their treatment have been presented in paper  i. in the results section of the present paper , we have discussed other important uncertain aspects of the process , namely the impact of collisions on the structure and growth of the vms and the possible effects of loss - cone depletion . in this last subsection , we consider the role of interstellar gas .",
    "because the runaway scenario presented here has to operate within the first few myr of the cluster life , it has , in fact , to be considered in the framework of cluster formation , which takes place on a similar timescale .",
    "no only does it mean , as mentioned above , that stars below @xmath299 may still be on the pre - ms , with much larger radii than adopted here , but , more importantly , that a significant amount of residual gas may be present .",
    "observations show that when a cluster forms , not more than 30% of the gas is eventually turned into stars @xcite but that clusters like r136 or ngc3603 , as young as @xmath300myr , are already devoid of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such clusters , the expulsion of gas ( originally the dominant mass component ) is driven by the ionising radiation and winds of ob stars and occurs impulsively . a large fraction of the stars",
    "are then lost from the cluster and the remaining bound cluster swells quite dramatically @xcite , an event likely to terminate the collisional phase after @xmath301myr rather than @xmath79myr . in clusters with an escape velocity much higher than the typical expansion velocity of the ionised gas , i.e. , @xmath302 , complete expulsion of the gas probably only occurs when the first sn explodes",
    ".    the faster evolution due to the much smaller size of the cluster in the embedded phase counterbalances the possible reduction in the time available for collisional runaway . assuming that , when gas is expelled , the mass of the cluster @xmath58 ( including gas ) is reduced by a factor of @xmath303 and its size @xmath279 expands @xmath304 times , the true initial relaxation time ( @xmath305 ) should be of order 4 times shorter than what is inferred from observations of the gas - free cluster .",
    "furthermore , the collision time ( @xmath306 ) may have been some 1000 times shorter , suggesting that a large fraction of clusters may actually be collisional at birth .",
    "the standard theory of star formation , which assumes spherically symmetric accretion of gas on to the protostar , fails for stars more massive than @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "this problem led to the proposal that the truly primordial imf may not extend past @xmath150 and that mergers may be at least partially responsible for the formation of more massive stars @xcite . this would also naturally explain why these massive stars are preferentially found in the central regions of clusters that are possibly too young to have experienced relaxational mass segregation @xcite . to occur on a sufficiently short timescale , collisions require central stellar densities orders of magnitude higher than what is observed in those young clusters but similar to what it may have been in the embedded phase",
    ".    realistic simulations of embedded clusters should include the role of gas , since its mass is likely to be more than twice that in stars .",
    "especially important are the increased velocity dispersion and accretion from the ambient gas .",
    "the pioneering sph/@xmath7-body simulations of very early cluster evolution could only handle up to a few hundred stars @xcite .",
    "our mc results ( run ` k3 - 20 ` presented in section  [ subsec : otherimfs ] ) suggest that , in much larger systems , collisions would lead to the formation of just one ( very ) massive star rather than a continuous spectrum spreading from @xmath150 to @xmath92 .",
    "however , this result applies to clusters driven to core collapse by mass segregation .",
    "when the cluster is initially collisional , more stars should take part in collisions and a high - mass spectrum may develop in a more orderly way ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coll_hist_hicoll ] ) . also , the collisional phase may be terminated before a runaway collision sequence starts through gas expulsion by massive stars .",
    "our predictable result that evolution of the massive stars off the ms terminates the evolution towards core collapse stems from our assumption that all gas released by the stars is completely ( and instantaneously ) lost from the cluster .",
    "if the gas is not totally expelled , there may be no core re - expansion .",
    "the core may instead remain very dense .",
    "this opens the possibility for a longer - term collisional evolution but now there will be plenty of stellar bhs around that may destroy ms stars .    over a long timescale ,",
    "it is possible that star formation will convert the gas into new stars @xcite .",
    "all this becomes obviously quite intricate but would have to be included to treat realistically proto - galactic nuclei . nowadays , multi - phase dynamical simulations , including interstellar gas ( possibly in two phases ) , stars and dark matter , and the matter and energy exchanges between these components , are commonly performed to investigate the formation and evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works are based on the use of collisionless @xmath7-body codes coupled with sph . including detailed gas dynamics in models of relaxing clusters",
    "is extremely chalenging because the gas should possess a complex , non spherically symmetric structure , evolving on timescales much shorter than @xmath253 @xcite .",
    "note that , in clusters with very high velocity dispersions , where collisions may significantly contribute to gas production , some of it will probably be retained .",
    "indeed this can be seen in the extreme situation of a completely disruptive collision ( a rare occurrence ; see @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the total energy of the colliding stars is their kinetic energy at ( relatively ) large separation minus the sum of their individual binding energy ( a positive quantity , by definition ) .",
    "none of the stars can have a velocity higher than the cluster s escape velocity @xmath160 and because the binding energy is positive , the energy available per unit mass of stellar gas has to be smaller than @xmath307 so at least some gas must stay in the cluster to conserve energy .",

    "<S> we present a new study of the collisional runaway scenario to form an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh , @xmath0 ) at the centre of a young , compact stellar cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the first phase is the formation of a very dense central core of massive stars ( @xmath1 ) through mass segregation and gravothermal collapse . </S>",
    "<S> previous work established the conditions for this to happen before the massive stars evolve off the main sequence ( ms ) . in this and a companion paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the next stage by implementing direct collisions between stars . using a monte carlo stellar dynamics code </S>",
    "<S> , we follow the core collapse and subsequent collisional phase in more than 100 models with varying cluster mass , size , and initial concentration . </S>",
    "<S> collisions are treated either as ideal , `` sticky - sphere '' mergers or using realistic prescriptions derived from 3-d hydrodynamics computations . in all cases for which the core collapse happens in less than the ms lifetime of massive stars ( @xmath2myr ) , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the growth of a single very massive star ( vms , @xmath3 ) through a runaway sequence of mergers . </S>",
    "<S> mass loss from collisions , even for velocity dispersions as high as @xmath4 , does not prevent the runaway . </S>",
    "<S> the region of cluster parameter space leading to runaway is even more extended than predicted in previous work because , in clusters with @xmath5 , collisions accelerate ( and , in extreme cases , drive ) core collapse . </S>",
    "<S> although the vms grows rapidly to @xmath6 in models exhibiting runaway , we can not predict accurately its final mass . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the termination of the runaway process must eventually be determined by a complex interplay between stellar dynamics , hydrodynamics , and the stellar evolution of the vms . in the vast majority of cases , we find that the time between successive collisions becomes much shorter than the thermal timescale of the vms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our assumption that all stars return quickly to the ms after a collision must eventually break down for the runaway product , and the stellar evolution of the vms becomes very uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason , the final fate of the vms , including its possible collapse to an imbh , remains unclear .    </S>",
