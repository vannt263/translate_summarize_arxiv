    "over the past few decades , our understanding of the interior of the sun  its thermodynamic structure , internal rotation , and dynamics  has been revolutionized by the technique of helioseismology , the study of the frequencies and amplitudes of seismic waves that penetrate deep into the solar interior ( leibacher et al .",
    "1985 ; duvall et al . 1988 ; schou et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the high quality of the modeling in the solar case is made possible by the large number ( @xmath4 ) of modes visible in the sun .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of spatial resolution inherent in stellar observations limits the number of detectable modes in stars to only a few ( those with low degree @xmath5 ) . nonetheless , successful detection of even a few modes has the potential to provide greatly improved values for fundamental stellar parameters such as mass , abundance , and age ( gough 1987 ; brown et al .",
    "1994 )    while oscillations have been successfully detected on roap stars , @xmath6 scuti stars , and white dwarfs , these stars all show oscillation amplitudes several orders of magnitude larger than is expected from solar - like stars .",
    "more recently , however , a number of authors ( hatzes & cochran 1994a , 1994b ; edmonds & gilliland 1996 ) have reported the detection of periodic variability at levels of a few hundred @xmath7 and/or several millimagnitudes in a number of k giants . however",
    ", each detection is of only a single mode , and multimodal oscillations have yet to be unambiguously detected in any cool star other than the sun .    in march 1999",
    ", nasa launched the wide - field infrared explorer satellite , with the intent of carrying out an infrared sky survey to better understand galaxy evolution .",
    "unfortunately , within days of launch the primary science instrument on wire failed due to loss of coolant .",
    "however , the satellite itself continues to function nearly perfectly , and in may we began a program of asteroseismology using the wire s onboard 52 mm aperture star camera .",
    "below we report wire s probable detection of multimodal oscillations on a cool star , which is the first of its kind .",
    "the wire satellite star camera , a ball aerospace model ct-601 , consists of a @xmath8 site ccd with @xmath9 m pixels ( 1 arc minute on the sky ) and gain of @xmath10 , fed by a 52 mm , f/1.75 refractive optical system .",
    "the read noise of the system is 30 electrons .",
    "the pixel data is digitized with a 16 bit adc , and up to five @xmath11 pixel fields can be digitized and transmitted to the ground . for this work ,",
    "we used only one field , which permitted us to read out the ccd at a rate of 10 hz .",
    "the stellar image is somewhat defocused , but essentially all of the light falls on the central @xmath12 pixel spot .",
    "the spectral response of the system is governed entirely by the response of the ccd plus the optical system , and is approximately equivalent to the v+r bandpass .",
    "the wire satellite is in a sun - synchronous orbit which , when combined with constraints imposed by the solar panels , limits pointing to two strips , each approximately @xmath13 wide , located perpendicular to the earth - sun line .",
    "in addition , continuous observing is not possible .",
    "early in the program , we were able to obtain only 7 or 8 minutes worth of data during every 96-minute orbit .",
    "later , after viewing constraints were relaxed ( which involved scheduling software and onboard data - table modifications ) , observing efficiency rose to as much as 40 minutes per target per orbit  up to two targets are possible during any orbit .",
    "thus , with integrations every 0.1 s , we acquired continuous data segments of up to 24,000 observations .",
    "bias correction was performed on board the satellite , and further data reduction was accomplished using software developed at ipac .",
    "each @xmath11 pixel field was extracted by summing the flux in the central @xmath14 pixel region .",
    "although scattered light in the field is limited by the one - meter sun - shield mounted on the star camera , we performed a background subtraction using the flux from a 20-pixel octagonal annulus surrounding the central region of the image .",
    "finally , we converted our fluxes to an instrumental magnitude .",
    "after removal of thermal effects ( see below ) , the rms noise in the final reduced time series was typically comparable to the 1.8 mmag noise expected from pure photon statistics , although non - poisson noise is certainly present as well .",
    "the lack of a good flat field for the instrument was a concern , which we dealt with by rejecting those frames in which the mean centroid of the stellar image lay more than @xmath15 from the mean position , where @xmath16 is the mean standard deviation of the image centroid .",
    "this criterion applied to approximately 3.8% of the observations , and the vast majority of these observations were at the start or end of an orbital segment .",
    "overall , the satellite displayed excellent attitude stability during our run , with @xmath16 measured to be typically 0.7 arc sec or less ( laher et al .",
    "@xmath0 uma was the primary target for wire from 18 may through 23 june 1999 .",
    "it is a k0 iii star ( taylor 1999 ) with an angular diameter of @xmath17 ( hall 1996 ; bell 1993 ) . at the hipparcos distance of 38",
    "pc , this corresponds to a stellar radius of @xmath18 , in substantial agreement with the earlier value of @xmath19 derived by bell ( 1993 ) .",
    "the effective temperature of the star is variously reported as @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( cayrel de stroebel 1992 ) , with the latter value being the most recent ( taylor 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath0 uma is a member of a binary system , with a total system mass of @xmath22 ( soderhjelm 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral type of @xmath0 uma b is somewhat unclear , with f7  v most often cited in the literature ( see , e.g. , the sao catalog ) . however , on the basis of iue observations , kondo , morgan , & modisette ( 1977 ) estimate the secondary to be `` late a '' ( see also ayres , marstad , & linsky 1981 ) . in either case , however , the secondary makes only a small contribution ( @xmath23 ) to the total system luminosity , and should show oscillation frequencies quite different from those of the primary .    during the observation period ,",
    "wire made a total of @xmath24 observations of @xmath0 uma , after removal of those observations with poor pointing characteristics .",
    "the data were first phased at the period of the spacecraft , to determine if any obvious instrumental periodicities existed .",
    "this phasing showed the existence of a strong sinusoidal variation , with amplitude @xmath25 mmag .",
    "a thermistor is mounted on the star camera , and examination of data from this thermistor showed that these variations were in fact correlated with temperature variations of a few tenths of a degree .",
    "although a thermoelectric cooler ( tec ) is mounted on the ccd , the star tracker thermal design lowered the ccd temperature below the default setpoint , so the tec never actually turned on . in order to reduce the impact of this signal on our data analysis , we prewhitened the data by fitting and subtracting from the entire time series a sinusoid constrained to have the satellite orbital period ( the phase was allowed to vary ) .",
    "the best - fit sinusoid has an amplitude of 8.63 mmag , and its subtraction results in an rms residual of 2.05 mmag , compared to the 1.84 mmag expected from photon statistics .",
    "we also explored other means of fitting and removing the thermal signature , including high - order polynomial fits to the phased data .",
    "such approaches , while more complex than sine fitting , did not lead to any appreciable improvement in the fit , and were therefore discarded .",
    "the use of any of these thermal fitting procedures did not affect the peaks in the amplitude spectrum described below .",
    "in fact , these peaks were visible even before the application of any fit to the thermal variation , though removal of the thermal signature , by removing the largest single peak , did help to render them more easily visible .    data from the first portion of the run ( 18 may - 7 june ) were all in short ( @xmath26 ) segments , which obviously extended over a short range of orbital phase ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we were concerned that including these data in our sine fit would bias the result , so we decided to exclude them from our analysis .",
    "in addition , nasa responded to our expressed concern about the tec by lowering the set point on 18 june , and the ccd behavior subsequent to this had not yet reached an equilibrium point before the end of our run .",
    "thus , we excluded data taken after 18 june from the analysis as well , leaving only the 8 june  18 june window of approximately @xmath28 . shortening",
    "the time series clearly adversely affects our frequency resolution , but we felt that confidence in the data quality was the overriding issue .",
    "the data that were subjected to analysis are shown in figure 1 , after removal of the thermal variation .",
    "data were searched for periodicities using discrete fourier transform ( dft ; foster 1996 ) , lomb - scargle periodogram ( scargle 1982 ; horne & baliunas 1986 ) , and epoch - folding techniques ( davies 1990 ) which are essentially equivalent to phase dispersion modulation ( pdm ; see stellingwerf 1978 ; schwarzenberg - czerny 1998 ) .",
    "the scargle periodogram analysis was conducted as described in scargle ( 1982 ; see also hatzes & cochrane 1994ab ) ; the data were windowed using a parzen function and the resulting periodogram was oversampled by a factor of 8 in frequency space .",
    "the dft analysis was similarly oversampled , and implemented the clean algorithm of roberts , lehar , & dreher ( 1987 ) to remove alias peaks . when using the dft , the data were windowed using a parzen function , and 100 iterations of clean were performed . due to its relative slowness ,",
    "epoch - folding analysis was conducted only within the frequency range of interest , as identified by the scargle and dft analysis , and was used only to aid in interpretation of the results from the other two algorithms . in the discussion that follows",
    ", we will concentrate on the lomb - scargle periodogram results , though , in general , the three techniques gave similar results .",
    "figure 2 shows the window function for the time series .",
    "the upper frequency limit for the figure has been arbitrarily set at @xmath29 to enhance the visibility of the amplitude spectrum at frequencies near 1 mhz , while the lowest frequencies are shown in the inset .",
    "no significant features are present in the window function above 5 mhz .",
    "the large evenly spaced peaks correspond to the satellite orbital frequency and its aliases .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram for the time series is shown in figure 3 on the same frequency scale as the window function .",
    "the low - frequency inset shows ten significant peaks , and the frequencies and amplitudes of these peaks are given in table  1 ( derived from lorentzian fits ) , along with conservative formal error estimates derived from the half - width of the periodogram peaks .",
    "we note that periodograms of portions of the time series ( halves and thirds ) give results similar to that of the whole , with decreased frequency resolution , and that sine fits to these frequencies show coherent phasing in these different portions .",
    "unfortunately , the implementation of the on - board data collection on wire means that we lack simultaneous observations of a comparison star , and are thus essentially performing absolute photometry with an instrument not designed for that purpose .",
    "however , we have observed stars other than @xmath0 uma , and the sun - synchronous orbit of wire implies that most instrumental effects should be similar for all sources .",
    "the dashed line in the figure  3 inset shows the periodogram from a time series of @xmath30 , a b7  v star not expected to show significant low - frequency oscillations .",
    "the @xmath0 leo data set , which was obtained from 23 may through 3 june 1999 , consists of segments similar in length to those of @xmath0 uma , has similar rms noise to the @xmath0 uma time series , and was reduced in exactly the same manner .",
    "our object here is not to perform analysis of the @xmath0 leo data ( which might well benefit from a different approach than we have used for @xmath0 uma ) , but rather to show that the particular low frequency peaks in the periodogram of @xmath0 uma do not arise from either instrumental effects or the data reduction procedure itself .",
    "the larger peaks in the @xmath0 leo periodogram may arise from an imperfect removal of both long - term and orbital variations ; none show coherent phasing across different segments of the time series .",
    "the dissimilarity of the two periodograms increases our confidence that the peaks visible in the @xmath0 uma periodogram are due to the star itself , although it is of course possible that the instrumental behavior changes significantly for different targets .",
    "as is apparent from figures 2 and 3 , the family of peaks visible at low frequencies is repeated at higher frequencies , which leads to the difficulty of determining which set of peaks is the correct one .",
    "we can easily eliminate peaks above @xmath31 by examining the summed power spectrum of the individual orbital segments , which shows no significant power at these frequencies .",
    "we are therefore left with the problem of selecting between the set of peaks in the @xmath32 range and the similar set around @xmath33 .",
    "we believe that the low - frequency peaks are the physical solution and the higher - frequency set an alias for the following two reasons :    1 .",
    "the low - frequency peaks are always of larger amplitude than the alias peaks .",
    "while a resonance of stochastic noise with an alias frequency can enhance an individual alias peak such that it is larger than the corresponding true peak , this is unlikely to occur simultaneously for multiple peaks .",
    "we have performed simulations which confirm this reasoning .",
    "2 .   hatzes ( 1999 , private communication ) has searched for oscillations in @xmath0 uma using ground - based spectroscopic methods . he reports finding frequencies of 1.36 and 6.0 @xmath34 ( the latter less convincingly ) , although his observing run was too short to lend much confidence to the exact values .",
    "while not identical to the frequencies we report here , these frequencies are certainly comparable to our lower - frequency peaks rather than to the alias peaks .    though neither of these factors is conclusive on its own , we believe that together they indicate that we are on solid ground interpreting the observed peaks in the amplitude spectrum as stellar oscillations . of course , it remains possible that the observed variations are due to instrumental effects or to non - oscillatory stellar phenomena such as granulation .",
    "below we discuss the astrophysical implications of our results .",
    "a more detailed discussion , in the context of a complete stellar interiors model for @xmath0 uma a , can be found in guenther et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .      the frequency of the fundamental mode is determined primarily by structure in the envelope and so its determination requires a complete stellar model . however , we can easily determine the range in which it should lie .",
    "the fundamental period @xmath35 is given by ( christy 1966 ; 1968 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 should lie between the value of 0.038 for a polytrope with @xmath38 and 0.116 ( for @xmath39 ) .",
    "using the values of @xmath40 from interferometry and the mass @xmath41 appropriate to a k0 giant yields a fundamental mode of between 2.8 and 8.6 days .",
    "the lowest frequency that we see corresponds to a period of 6.35 days , so we identify it as the fundamental mode for @xmath0 uma .    as noted above , the average mode spacing for the first 8 modes is @xmath42 .",
    "the last two modes have much larger spacings , which we interpret as signifying that we are not detecting all of the possible oscillation modes for the star , presumably because they are not excited to large amplitudes .",
    "the large separation @xmath43 is related to the mean stellar density , as shown by cox ( 1980 ) : @xmath44 using the values appropriate to a typical k0 giant yields a predicted spacing of @xmath45 , about half the observed value . once again",
    ", this discrepancy can be accounted for by assuming that all modes are not excited . in particular ,",
    "if only even or odd - valued radial @xmath46 modes are excited , we would expect the observed large separation to be twice the predicted value .",
    "the simplest explanation is then that only the @xmath47 modes are excited , and the frequencies we observe correspond to radial oscillations of the star .",
    "the kjeldsen & bedding ( 1995 ) scaling law @xmath48 predicts oscillation amplitudes of @xmath49 for @xmath0 uma , which is essentially in agreement with our results . it should be noted that the wire data are obtained in white light and , consequently , phase differences in the oscillation amplitudes as a function of wavelength would tend to combine to reduce the observed amplitude .",
    "consequently , it is not surprising that the observed amplitudes are somewhat smaller than those predicted by theory .",
    "in addition , of course , extending a relationship derived for lower main sequence stars to giants is a risky enterprise ! nonetheless , the near - agreement between theory and observation may imply that the excitation mechanism for oscillations in @xmath0 uma is fundamentally similar to the solar mechanism ( presumably convection ; see , e.g. bogdan et al 1993 ) , unlike oscillations observed in other k giants , which show amplitudes an order of magnitude greater than those we have detected .",
