    "we study the optical physical sense of these profiles .",
    "finally , in section 4 we show an interesting relation between the profiles @xmath8 and the caustic of the given wave front , which also allows us to construct them from the caustic .",
    "let us remember some properties of the cartesian ovals .",
    "the ovals of descartes or cartesian ovals were introduced by descartes in 1637 in his dioptrique , dedicated to the study of light refraction .",
    "a cartesian oval is the locus of the points from which the distances @xmath9 and @xmath10 to two fixed points @xmath11 and @xmath12 , called foci , verify the bipolar equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants .",
    "observe that this equation includes the bifocal definition of conics for the particular cases of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( ellipse ) , or @xmath19 ( hyperbola ) .",
    "a cartesian oval has a third focus @xmath20 , and the oval can be defined by any two of the foci ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath21 goes to @xmath22 , the third focus goes to infinity and we get the conics .    the so - called complete cartesian oval is the set of curves associated to the bipolar equation @xmath23 only two of the four equations obtained from these double signs are not empty . if @xmath24 , they are closed curves , one interior to the other ( see figure  2 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "these two curves intersect only when two foci coincide . in this case",
    "we get the so - called limaon of pascal .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed study of these ovals .",
    "reference @xcite contains some applications of these ovals to holography .",
    "focuses in @xmath4 after refraction at the profile @xmath8 .",
    "this profile is the envelope of a family of interior descartes ovals @xmath27 with foci @xmath4 and @xmath28 ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the refractive indices . ]",
    "[ figuno ]    a complete cartesian oval is symmetric with respect to the straight line determined by the foci @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , if we consider @xmath11 and @xmath12 belonging to @xmath1 , the bipolar equation is the equation of a surface of revolution in @xmath1 with axis of revolution @xmath31 .",
    "since the intersection of this surface with any plane containing @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a complete cartesian oval , we have called this surface complete cartesian oval of revolution .",
    "the fact that makes interesting cartesian ovals of revolution in the context of geometrical optics is the following .",
    "consider a surface @xmath0 separating two media with refractive indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and two points @xmath11 and @xmath12 in medium @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . if we want that a ray coming from @xmath11 goes to @xmath12 , then the point @xmath32 where the ray cross @xmath33 must verify that @xmath34 be constant , but this shows that @xmath33 is part of a cartesian oval of revolution , as we see looking at eqn .. because the refractive indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related with the light velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the light vacuum velocity , the above condition is equivalent to say , that all the rays spend the same time going from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , and this is the fermat principle",
    ". we will see in section 3 , that only some relative position of the foci with respect to the complete oval of revolution and some portions of this oval have physical sense .    in what follows",
    "let @xmath27 denote the complete cartesian oval of revolution with foci @xmath4 and @xmath28 , satisfying eqn . for the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 equal to the refractive indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , and the optical path length between @xmath4 and @xmath38 , @xmath16 , equals to @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the envelope of the family @xmath40 .",
    "we will give an explicit parametrization of @xmath8 and from it we will determine which portion have physical sense as refracting profile .    from now on",

    "according to the definition of the envelope of a two - parameter family of surfaces ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the envelope @xmath8 of the family @xmath40 is the set of points @xmath48 such that exists @xmath49 verifying the equations : @xmath50 for @xmath51 being the standard coordinates in @xmath52 and @xmath53 a parametrization of w.    the envelope @xmath8 is therefore obtained by eliminating @xmath54 and @xmath55 between the following equations @xmath56    then , equation becomes @xmath57 which , is also the equation of the line @xmath58 , normal to @xmath5 at @xmath59 , and thus it follows that @xmath60 this proves that the normal line to @xmath5 at @xmath38 intersects the envelope @xmath8 at the points @xmath61 where the envelope itself is tangent to the cartesian oval @xmath27 ( see figure  2 ) .    in order to give an explicit parametrization of @xmath8 , we suppose that @xmath5 is oriented and we take @xmath62 to be the outward unitary normal vector field to @xmath5 .",
    "according to ( [ eqintersection ] ) , @xmath8 can be given by the parametric equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 has to be determined by the condition that @xmath41 , that is , @xmath65 has to verify .",

    "to see that @xmath65 is an immersion we have to verify that the vectors @xmath82 are linearly independent .",
    "if we chose a suitable parametrization in @xmath5 , we can assume that the vectors @xmath83 are orthonormals .",
    "with respect to the orthonormal base @xmath84 of @xmath1 , the two first components of the vectors @xmath85 form a @xmath86- matrix given by : @xmath87 where for the second identity we have used that @xmath88 .",
    "this matrix is singular if and only if @xmath89 is an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath90 which is the matrix associated to the second fundamental form of @xmath5 at @xmath59 with respect to the base @xmath91 of the tangent plane to @xmath5 ( see p. 141 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , its eigenvalues are the principal curvatures of @xmath5 at @xmath59 .",
    "it follows that the matrix ( [ eqmatrix ] ) is singular if and only if @xmath89 is a principal curvature of @xmath5 at @xmath59 , or equivalently , @xmath92 is a centre of principal curvature of @xmath5 at @xmath59 .",
    "then we have proved the following theorem :    [ 1 ] suppose that @xmath8 does not contain any centre of principal curvature of @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath8 is an immersed surface of @xmath1 .    according to the above theorem , the singularities of the refracting profiles @xmath8 are the points @xmath93 which are centres of principal curvature of @xmath5 .",

    "we will study now which sheets of @xmath8 are adequate as refracting and focusing profiles .",
    "that is , which sheets produce the wave front @xmath5 after refracting at them a spherical wave front emanating from @xmath4 , or equivalently , focus @xmath5 in @xmath4 .",
    "first of all , we will give an explicit parametrization of the family of complete cartesian ovals @xmath40 .    to reduce the problem to the 2-dimensional case",

    "it illustrates also the following discussion .",
    "the solution @xmath119 ( dashed line in figure  4(a ) ) , has two parts : one in the interior oval @xmath73 , and the other in the exterior oval @xmath74 .",
    "they correspond to the values of @xmath120 for which @xmath121 , and are separated by other two regions where @xmath122 .",

    "these four values of @xmath120 are the corresponding to the values of the angle between @xmath118 and the four tangent lines to the interior @xmath73 and the exterior @xmath74 ovals passing through @xmath4 .",
    "for the solution @xmath124 ( solid line in figure  4(a ) ) , we have an analogous decomposition .",
    "then both the interior and exterior ovals are made up of two pieces , one corresponding to @xmath119 ( dashed line in figure  4(a ) ) and the other corresponding to @xmath124 ( solid line in figure  4 ( a ) ) .",
    "when @xmath4 is in the interior of the ovals , @xmath125 never vanishes , so in this case , the exterior and interior ovals coincide with the ovals @xmath119 ( dashed line in figure  4(b ) ) and @xmath124 ( solid line in figure  4(b ) ) respectively",
    ".    a sheet of @xmath8 could have physical sense as refracting or focusing profile only when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are at different sides of the tangent plane to the sheet at any point of it , and a point @xmath65 being in that sheet must verify @xmath126 . on the other hand , for any @xmath28 , a point @xmath65 in the interior oval @xmath73 verifies ( see @xcite ) @xmath127 and a point @xmath65 of the exterior oval @xmath74 verifies @xmath128    from condition we know that the refracted ray at the point @xmath129 of a ray emanating from @xmath4 , passes through @xmath38 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "we know also by ( 2.7 ) that the normal line to @xmath5 at @xmath38 intersects the envelope @xmath130 at the points @xmath61 where the envelope itself is tangent to the oval @xmath27 .",
    "this fact together with the above observation means that the rays produced from the point source @xmath4 by refraction at @xmath130 are the normal rays to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we have proved the following result , which can be considered the main result of this paper .",
    "[ 3 ] let @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath130 be as defined above .",
    "then the profile @xmath130 refracts the rays emerging from @xmath4 into the normal rays to @xmath5 .",
    "in other words the theorem says that the wave front @xmath5 can be obtained from a spherical wave front emerging from @xmath4 after refraction at @xmath130 , or equivalently the profile @xmath130 focuses the wave front @xmath5 in @xmath4 .",
    "we can prove with an analogous reasoning that the sheet @xmath76 has a physical sense when we consider @xmath4 as a virtual source point .",

    "reasoning as before , we obtain that under these condition :    [ 5 ] any spherical wave front @xmath131 , convergent to @xmath4 from the medium of @xmath29 , after refraction at @xmath139 produces the wave front @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , the theorem says that the wave front @xmath5 after refraction at @xmath139 , produces a spherical divergent wave front @xmath131 with centre @xmath4 .",
    "a nice optical property can be deduced from theorems [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] .",

    "then a spherical wave front converging to @xmath4 and after refraction at @xmath139 , produces the wave front @xmath5 , and subsequent refraction at @xmath76 gives a divergent spherical wave front with centre @xmath4 ( see figure  4(b ) ) .",
    "this property can also have useful applications .",
    "notice that if we want to have physical sense , in all the above discussion we must exclude the region of the profile in which there are total reflection , that is , we have to exclude the points @xmath65 of the profile such that the corresponding incidence angle @xmath141 does not give a real value for the angle of refraction @xmath142 .",
