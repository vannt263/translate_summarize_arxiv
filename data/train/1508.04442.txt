    "the open stellar cluster ngc  6791 is one of the four open clusters that fall in the observed field of the _ kepler _ project @xcite .",
    "it is the oldest open clusters in the galaxy and contains many close and wide binary systems .",
    "however , only a few of them fall within _ kepler _ s view .",
    "studies of binary systems that are members of a cluster allow us to estimate both the age of the host cluster and its distance .",

    "are important old open clusters .",
    "binary systems that are member of clusters with different chemical composition are good targets to test how stellar evolution varies with composition , when we can determine their physical parameters and construct appropriate evolutionary models .",
    "the system v568  lyr resides at the main - sequence turn - off in the colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the cluster and this turn - off point gives us information on the age of the cluster .",
    "hence , the study of this particular system gives substantial information on both the stars and the cluster in which they reside .",
    "this is a crucial system , particularly given its detached configuration and accurate radial velocity curve and photometry .",
    "@xcite analysed the chemical composition of the stars at the turn - off of ngc  6791 with keck  +  hires spectra and estimated the metallicity to be more than twice that of the sun .",

    "previous studies on the metallicity of the cluster give the [ fe / h ] ratio as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed archival keck / hires spectra of main  sequence turn  off and evolved stars of ngc  6791 .",
    "they obtained c , n , o and na abundances .",
    "there are various methods to determine the age of the cluster but determination of the chemical composition is always an important factor .",
    "brogaard et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 ) used binary system properties of v568 lyr to estimate the age of the cluster to be @xmath12gyr consistent with other estimates of @xmath13gyr .",
    "there have been a number of photometric studies of ngc  6791 and some of its stars .",
    "@xcite observed the cluster with the @xmath14 filters of the @xmath15 m kpno telescope . @xcite",
    "obtained detailed @xmath16 observations with the @xmath17 m nordic optical telescope and obtained data for colour  magnitude and colour  colour diagrams .",
    "present comprehensive cluster membership and @xmath18 photometry of the cluster . using _",
    "photometry , @xcite studied solar - like oscillations of red giants of the cluster .",
    "photometric studies of some of the variable stars in ngc  6791 have also been made by , @xcite and .",
    "v568  lyr is a relatively long - period system so a full and accurate light curve of the system could not be obtained .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined its orbital period .",
    "later @xcite and performed light and radial velocity analyses of ground - based data and determined masses of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , radii of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the primary and secondary components .",
    "the field of ngc  6791 is rich in binary systems , most of which are members of the cluster .",
    "the systems v519  lyr , v522  lyr and v564  lyr are interacting close binary systems .",
    "there is no published spectroscopic study of these systems .",
    "v568  lyr is , on the other hand , a well - detached system and has excellent radial velocity curves .",
    "this , together with the new _ kepler _ light curve , makes it important to determine accurate physical parameters of its components and so provide better distance and age estimates . here ,",
    "owing to their high sensitivity and quality , we use public _ kepler _ observations supplemented with the radial velocity and abundance measurements of @xcite and . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the public _",
    "kepler _ data and the light curve and radial velocity data of v568  lyr are solved simultaneously . in the third section ,",
    "the parameters of the system and the distance to the cluster are determined . in the fourth section ,",
    "non - conservative binary evolutionary models are constructed with ev(twin ) and then these are compared with those of earlier studies .",
    ".basic properties of v568  lyr ( kic  2437452 ) .",
    "magnitudes , temperature and @xmath23 are from @xcite and and other parameters from the _ kepler _ input catalogue ( kic ) and simbad . [ cols= \" < , < , <",
    ", < \" , ]     when we leave the eccentricity as a free parameter during the solution it tends to zero . using the orbital parameters ( table  [ tab : lc ] ) we obtained the physical parameters of v568 lyr and list them in table  [ tab : v568lyr : phypar ] .",
    "while solving , the temperature of the sun is taken to be 5772  k and its bolometric magnitude to be 4.755 mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperatures of the components with the @xcite tables give the bolometric corrections as bc@xmath24 mag , and bc@xmath25 mag . using these bc values for _ v _ band",
    ", we then obtain the absolute magnitudes of the components .",
    "these new estimates of the system parameters , with the magnitudes and reddening , reveal the distance of the system to be @xmath26kpc .",
    "the masses we find are consistent with those found by .",
    "the radius of the primary star , on the other hand , is estimated to be @xmath27per cent larger while the secondary star is estimated @xmath28per cent smaller than in their study .",
    "these differences are most probably due to the higher accuracy of _ kepler _ data relative to ground - based observations .",
    "we have simultaneously solved the radial velocity and light curve of the detached and relatively long period binary v568  lyr and determined its orbital and physical parameters ( table  [ tab : v568lyr : phypar ] ) .",
    "the well - detached configuration of v568  lyr allows us to determine very accurate orbital and physical parameters ( tables  [ tab : lc ] and  [ tab : v568lyr : phypar ] ) .",
    "the distance to the cluster is found to be 4.26@xmath29kpc , equivalent to a distance modulus of @xmath30 mag .",
    "this is roughly consistent with other distance estimates .",
    "@xcite found a distance modulus of @xmath31 by analysing a cmd .",
    "@xcite found 12.6 using isochrones .",
    "@xcite obtained 12.613.6 again with isochrones .",
    "based on the fit to the white dwarf cooling sequence @xcite obtained distance scale as 13.50 . determined @xmath32 with binary system parameters .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath33 for the red giant stars .    to model this system and compare it with observations",
    "allows us to test our understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "v568  lyr , in particular , gives us the opportunity to estimate the age of the cluster .",
    "we made with the ev code @xcite and its much more powerful twin variant @xcite , both of which are based on the cambridge stars code @xcite .",
    "in single - star evolution , the effects of rotation and dynamo activity on mass  loss and the proximity of the companion are often not considered .",
    "the ev code admits various non - conservative processes to be applied to the primary component of the binary system . in the newer twin variant , _",
    "both _ components are solved _ simultaneously _ so that the effect of tidal dissipation on stellar rotation , orbital period and eccentricity and on dynamo activity , and hence on mass  loss , in both components are treated self - consistently .",
    "stellar winds carry off angular momentum by way of magnetic braking and this angular momentum can be extracted from the _ orbit _ if tidal dissipation is strong enough .",
    "we might imagine that tidal dissipation has played a role in the evolution of v568  lyr because its orbit is circular and many systems with @xmath34d are markedly eccentric .",
    "tidal dissipation leads to spin  orbit synchronization ( or pseudo - synchronization in eccentric orbits ) much more quickly than it causes circularization .",
    "it is not easy to determine the initial state of a binary system if the evolution is not conservative .",
    "we can reasonably assume that the initial masses were larger than now but it is not clear , without some trial and error , by how much they were larger .",
    "further , it is entirely likely that there is some non - linearity in the behaviour so that a straight - forward convergence procedure that assumes near - linearity may not in fact converge or at least converge badly .",
    "the metallicity of ngc 6791 has been estimated to be about two and a half times solar @xcite , rather surprisingly because the cluster is also estimated by them to be nearly twice the age of the sun .",
    "however the metallicity of the sun has itself been subject to recent downward revision @xcite although there is probably still some uncertainty because the new value seems to spoil the apparent agreement of earlier models of the sun with helioseismology @xcite .",
    "we have used the tabular data of the opal data base @xcite for @xmath35 , corresponding to nearly three times the value that @xcite obtained for the sun , and to about 2.5 times the solar metallicity as estimated by more recently by caffau et al .",
    "however we adopt this value mainly because it leads to much better agreement between the observational and theoretical luminosities , radii and masses of the components , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the zero - age helium abundance was taken to be @xmath36 , and the mixing - length ratio to be 2.0 .",
    "aspects of the code have been described in detail by eggleton ( 2006 ) and papers referred to therein .",
    "the only ( slight ) novelty is that convective core overshooting has been calibrated fairly carefully in a study by eggleton & griffin ( 2015 ) of 53 binaries almost all of which are evolved to giant or supergiant dimensions , where the issue of convective overshooting is much more challenged than by near - main - sequence stars including the present subject .",
    "the new model of overshooting in fact makes very little difference in the present case .    after some experimentation , we evolved a pair of stars with initial masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 , spin periods of 2 d each , an eccentricity of 0.3 and an orbital period of 15.79 days .",
    "we expect the orbital period to decrease if the orbit circularizes , but it is also influenced by magnetic braking and by mass loss .",
    "in addition , it will also increase as the orbit acquires angular momentum from the spins of the stars by tidal friction .",
    "the particular model of the non - conservative processes in the code ( @xcite , but see below ) led the system to evolve , after 7.733 gyr to roughly the observed period , masses , radii and temperatures ( cf table  [ tab : v568lyr : phypar ] ) : 14.42d , 1.0888 and 0.8285@xmath39 , 1.428 and 0.781 @xmath40 , 1.949 and 0.309@xmath41 , and temperatures 5712 and 4872k .",
    "we see that the secondary component model is rather too hot , large and luminous , but probably not unacceptably so ( 2  3% ) .",
    "4 shows the mean observed values ( @xmath42 in solar units and effective @xmath43 in kelvin ) as black squares , with an ` error cloud ' of dots distributed according to an assumed gaussian distribution with the standard errors as tabulated above .",
    "the blue circle is a point on the evolutionary track of the primary that is reasonably close to the observed value , and the blue asterisk is the coval point on the secondary s ( very short ) track , i.e. a point on the same isochrone as the primary .",
    "-0.2truein + -0.2truein    -0.2truein    however , in order to produce a nearly circular orbit we had to increase the model tidal friction by a factor of 100 , and even then the eccentricity , starting from a hypothetical 0.3 , was only reduced by a factor of 6 , which might just be compatible with the observations .",
    "we believe that the inadequacy of tidal friction is likely to be a problem for any other model , because 14.5 d is a rather long period for two near - main - sequence stars to have circularized their orbit , even in quite an old cluster @xcite .",
    "the fact that the two masses decreased by as much as @xmath44 per cent and @xmath45 per cent in the course of @xmath46gyr is perhaps noteworthy .",
    "single stars similar to either component would lose less mass but that is because they would have spun down to much slower rotation rates by magnetic braking in the absence of tidal friction .",
    "the same non - conservative model as used above , when applied to the sun , gives the observed solar - wind strength and alfvn radius , by design , at age @xmath47gyr .",
    "this model predicts a loss of @xmath48 per cent of the initial mass but almost all of this takes place in the first gyr when the sun is rotating in about @xmath49d or less .",
    "the lower - mass component of our binary loses mass faster , partly because its deeper convective layer is assumed to make it more active and partly because old k dwarfs are normally rotating even more slowly than the sun .",
    "this one is rotating substantially faster if it is synchronized , which it surely must be .",
    "we acknowledge the _ kepler _ team for giving public access to their corrected light curves and thank the anonymous referee for the careful reading and for suggestions .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "this study was supported by the turkish scientific and research council ( tbitak 111t270 , 112t766 and 113f097 ) .",
