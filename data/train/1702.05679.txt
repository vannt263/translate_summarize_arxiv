    "heterogeneous cellular networks with dense deployment of access points ( aps ) are anticipated to be a major component of 5 g networks .",
    "a challenge with such dense deployments is interference management .",
    "coordinated radio resource allocation across multiple cells is one approach for mitigating inter - cell interference . that includes joint scheduling across multiple cells over a fast timescale  @xcite as well as the assignment of resources across cells over a slower timescale  @xcite .",
    "whereas the former approach requires instantaneous knowledge of channel gains , the latter approach relies on statistical knowledge of interference .",
    "we consider the joint allocation of spectrum and user association in a large network with many aps .",
    "the objective is to optimize a network utility , such as average delay , given traffic statistics over a geographic region that change slowly relative to channel fading .",
    "our approach builds on our prior work @xcite in which for a network of @xmath0 aps and @xmath3 mobiles ( or user equipments ( ues ) ) , the spectrum is partitioned into @xmath7 _ patterns _ , corresponding to all possible subsets of active aps .",
    "the problem is to optimize the widths of spectrum segments , associated with the different patterns , along with the user association under each pattern .",
    "this has been shown to provide significant performance improvement in throughput enhancement and delay reduction @xcite .",
    "the original convex problem formulation in @xcite is not useful for large networks because the number of patterns grows as @xmath1 . in prior work  @xcite , we have reduced the number of variables to @xmath8 by recognizing that each link rate depends only on _ local _ patterns of active aps .",
    "the problem can then be redefined over sets of overlapping _ interference neighborhoods _ , associated with those local patterns .",
    "each ap has its own interference neighborhood , which captures the interference from nearby aps .",
    "the challenge with the approach in  @xcite is to ensure that the spectrum assigned to each particular ap is consistent across the neighborhoods to which it belongs . to accomplish that , the spectrum is discretized and a coloring algorithm is proposed to ensure that the local patterns of active aps are globally consistent .",
    "here we take a different approach to addressing the scalability problem .",
    "this is based on the fact that the solution is _ sparse _ , meaning that at most @xmath4 out of the @xmath7 possible patterns appear in the optimal allocation for a general network utility function .",
    "hence we reformulate the problem by dividing the spectrum into @xmath4 segments , rather than @xmath7 , and attempt to identify the pattern that should be associated with each segment .",
    "this effectively reverses the approach in  @xcite , which attempts to assign a segment of spectrum to each pattern . in this reformulation",
    ", we initially assume that any combination of patterns can be assigned to each of the @xmath4 segments .",
    "this problem is a convex relaxation of our original problem .",
    "the one - to - one mapping of spectrum segments to patterns is then enforced with an @xmath5 ( cardinality ) constraint .",
    "an algorithm for finding an approximate solution to this problem is presented based on a reweighted @xmath6 approximation of this constraint @xcite .",
    "the approach to scalability presented here has the advantage of eliminating the combinatorial coloring problem that arises in  @xcite . instead",
    ", a new @xmath5 constraint is introduced .",
    "although this does not simplify the original problem , it helps in finding an approximate solution , since the reweighted @xmath6 approximations for the @xmath5 constraints are known to perform well .",
    "numerical results indicate that this method generally gives better performance for a fixed computational complexity than the method in  @xcite .",
    "as in  @xcite , we consider a network containing the set of aps @xmath9 and the set of ues @xmath10 .",
    "each `` ue '' is actually associated with a particular location , and could refer to a group of nearby mobiles . the @xmath0 aps share @xmath11 hz of spectrum . for convenience ,",
    "we normalize @xmath12 .",
    "each ap can transmit on any part(s ) of the spectrum , which is homogeneous ( has the same distance attenuation ) .",
    "aps sharing the same spectrum interfere at ues within range of both transmitters .",
    "all transmissions are assumed to be omni - directional , although a similar set of problems can be reformulated with directional transmissions .",
    "we define a subset of active ( transmitting ) aps @xmath13 as a _",
    "pattern_. there are @xmath7 patterns , and a particular allocation of spectrum maps each pattern to a slice of spectrum .",
    "we denote an allocation as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the amount of bandwidth assigned to pattern @xmath16 .",
    "an example with three aps is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod ] .",
    "ap 1 owns @xmath17 exclusively ; shares @xmath18 with ap 2 ; shares @xmath19 with ap 3 ; and shares @xmath20 with both ap 2 and ap 3 .",
    "user association is determined by how the spectrum assigned to a particular ap is allocated to different ues .",
    "specifically , denote the fraction of total bandwidth used by ap @xmath21 to serve ue @xmath22 under pattern @xmath16 as @xmath23 , for @xmath24 .",
    "ue @xmath22 is then assigned to ap @xmath21 if @xmath25 for some @xmath26 .",
    "since the total bandwidth assigned to pattern @xmath16 is @xmath15 , we have @xmath27 the total bandwidth allocated to all patterns is then @xmath28 let @xmath29 denote the spectral efficiency of the link from ap @xmath21 to ue @xmath22 under pattern @xmath16 .",
    "this is measured over a _",
    "slow timescale _ , and is therefore an average over short - term fading .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is therefore determined by the distance between ap @xmath21 and ue @xmath22 , shadowing , and similar long - term characteristics of the interference links from aps in @xmath16 to ue location @xmath22 . for concreteness",
    "we assume @xmath30 where @xmath31 if @xmath24 and @xmath32 otherwise , @xmath33 is the transmit power spectral density ( psd ) at ap @xmath21 , @xmath34 is the power gain of link @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the noise psd at ue @xmath22 .",
    "we assume fixed , flat transmit psds over the slow timescale considered .",
    "the factor @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the average packet length ( bits ) , gives the units in packets / sec .",
    "the link gain @xmath34 includes pathloss and shadowing effects .",
    "clearly , @xmath39 if @xmath40 , i.e. , ap @xmath21 does not transmit on pattern @xmath16 . in practice",
    ", the spectral efficiencies can be measured as time - averaged channel gains .",
    "the total rate received by ue @xmath22 is therefore @xmath41",
    "the problem is to maximize a network utility function over the spectrum allocation and user association designated by @xmath42 , @xmath43 :    p0 [ eq : opt ] @xmath44    and constraints , , and , where the network utility function @xmath45 depends on the service rates to all ues .",

    "this assumes exponential packet lengths and backlogged interference  @xcite .    solving  [ eq : opt ]",
    "becomes prohibitively expensive as the network size grows , due to the inherit complexity from the @xmath7 global patterns .",

    "determining which @xmath4 active patterns appear in a solution is then the key challenge in solving  [ eq : opt ] .",
    "we first reduce the number of variables in from @xmath1 to @xmath8 by reformulating over _ interference neighborhoods _ based on local patterns  @xcite . due to pathloss , we assume interference vanishes beyond a certain distance .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the set of links with nonzero gains .",
    "hence each ue only receives power from aps within its neighborhood : @xmath56 from the ap side , each ap can only transmit to a collection of ues in a ap neighborhood with positive rates : @xmath57 we define the interference neighborhood for each ap @xmath21 as : @xmath58 i.e. , @xmath59 includes ap @xmath21 and all aps that interfere with it .",
    "an example with three aps ( denoted by @xmath60 ) and 2 ues ( denoted by @xmath61 ) is shown in fig  [ fig : localpattern ] .",
    "the set of nonzero links are @xmath62 .",
    "the ap neighborhoods are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ; and the ue neighborhoods are @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ap 1",
    "s interference neighborhood is @xmath68 , as ap 2 interferes with it at ue @xmath69 .",
    "ap 3 s interference neighborhood is @xmath70 , as ap 2 interferes with it at ue @xmath71 .",
    "ap 2 s interference neighborhood is @xmath72 , since ap 1 and ap 3 interfere with ap 2 at ue @xmath69 and ue @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the spectral efficiency of link @xmath35 only depends on the local patterns in @xmath73 , according to the definition of ue neighborhoods in  . therefore , for any link @xmath35 , the spectral efficiency under a global pattern @xmath16 is equivalent to its intersection with ue @xmath22",
    "s neighborhood @xmath73 : @xmath74    we next express each rate in terms of local patterns .",
    "we define bandwidth allocation variables within a local interference neighborhood @xmath75 as : @xmath76 [ line - through]*if we treat an interference cluster @xmath75 as a partition of all the global patterns , many global patterns are equivalent .",
    "* because all global patterns sharing the same overlap with @xmath75 contribute to the same local pattern of ap @xmath21 , @xmath77 represents the bandwidth allocated to link @xmath35 under local pattern @xmath78 .",
    "hence from ap @xmath21 s perspective , the bandwidth assigned to a local pattern @xmath78 must be the sum of the bandwidths assigned to all global patterns containing @xmath78 . the service rate of link @xmath35 , as defined in  ,",
    "can then be calculated as @xcite : @xmath79where we have used   and  , and the fact that only aps in @xmath73 transmit to ue @xmath22 with positive rate .      motivated by proposition [ thm : spec ] , we reformulate by dividing the spectrum into @xmath4 segments , and seek to assign a single pattern to each segment .",
    "proposition [ thm : spec ] implies that by optimizing this assignment we obtain a solution to [ eq : opt ] .",
    "[ line - through]*the number of local patterns in each local interference cluster is bounded despite the size of the network .",
    "the general idea is provided here .",
    "* let @xmath80 denote the bandwidth of the @xmath81th segment ( to be optimized ) .",
    "we now associate a set of variables @xmath82 ( for local neighborhoods ) and @xmath83 _ for each segment _ @xmath81 .",
    "we can therefore rewrite the rate in   as @xmath84 where the first sum is over the @xmath4 spectrum segments .",
    "apart from the addition of segment index , the @xmath82 variable is the same local bandwidth allocation variable defined in  .",
    "the amount of bandwidth assigned to local pattern @xmath78 in ap @xmath21 s interference neighborhood @xmath75 within segment @xmath81 is @xmath85 the total amount of spectrum assigned to @xmath75 satisfies @xmath86    we also introduce the following _ consistency constraint _ to ensure that the amount of spectrum allocated to an ap is consistent across any two neighborhoods @xmath75 and @xmath87 that contain it  @xcite .",
