    "<S> it is demonstrated that all observed fractions at moderate landau level fillings for the quantum hall effect can be obtained without recourse to the phenomenological concept of composite fermions . the possibility to have the special topologically nontrivial many - electron wave functions </S>",

    "<S> these gaps were calculated for some lattices in a simplified model .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental discovery of integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) by k.v klitzing ( 1980 ) and fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) by tsui , stormer and gossard ( 1982 ) was one of the most outstanding achievements in condensed matter physics of the last century .    </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that more than twenty years have elapsed since the experimental discovery of quantum hall effect ( qhe ) , the theory of this phenomenon is far from being complete ( see reviews @xcite,@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is primarily true for the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , which necessitates the electron  electron interaction and can not be explained by the one - particle theory , in contrast to the iqhe </S>",
    "<S> . the most successful variational many - electron wave function for explaining the 1/3 and other odd inverse fillings was constructed by laughlin(@xcite,@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation of other observed fractions was obtained by various phenomenological hierarchial schemes with construction of the `` daughter '' states from the basic ones ( haldane 1983,laughlin 1984 , b.halperin 1984 ) .    in those works , </S>",
    "<S> the approximation of extremely high magnetic field was used and all states were constructed from the states at the lowest landau level . however </S>",
    "<S> , this does not conform to the experimental situation , where the cyclotron energy is of the order of the mean energy of electron  </S>",
    "<S> electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this approach encounters difficulties in generalizing to the other fractions . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations also give a rather crude approximation for the realistic multiparticle functions , because the number of particles in the corresponding calculations on modern computers does not exceed several tens .    </S>",
    "<S> the most successful phenomenological description is given by the jain s model of `` composite '' fermions @xcite,@xcite , which predicts the majority of observed fractions . according to this model , </S>",
    "<S> electrons are dressed by magnetic - flux quanta with magnetic field concentrated in an infinitely narrow region around each electron . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that even number of flux quanta provides that these particles are fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of this additional magnetic field in the formalized theory leads to the so - called chern simons hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is described in details in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this theory gives an artificial 6-fermionic interaction whereas    the actulal calculations use quite crude mean field approximation of the `` effective '' magnetic field as the sum of the external magnetic field and some additional artificial field that provides the total magnetic flux quanta in accordance with jain s model of composite fermions .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we shall show how to remove some restrictions of jain - chern - simons model and obtain a more general and more simple model which does not change the standard coulomb interaction of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the main concept is associated with the notion of topological classification of quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> there is a number of topological textures in condensed matter physics : vortex lattices in a rotating superfluid , abrikosov vortices in superconductors , skyrmions in 2d electron systems at integer fillings of landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to give an exact topological classification of the multiparticle wave function for various physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> possibly the most simple and general definition can be done using canonical transformation of the field operators of the second quantization . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical transformation of the field operators is one which does not change their commutation relations . </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider the statistical transmutations which possibly can not be achieved at low energies considered in condensed matter physics . in general there must be the proper topological classification of the canonical transformations itself .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we consider the simplest case of the fermion canonical transformation not including spin degrees of freedom and assuming the full polarization of 2d electrons @xmath0 with @xmath1 ) having vortex kind singularities . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy fermi kind commutation relations if @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfy them . inserting these expressions into the standard hamiltonian for the interacting electrons ( with omitted spin indices )    @xmath6    </S>",
    "<S> we get a new hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we want to consider a set of periodic vortexlike singularities in @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> vector @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of weierstrass zeta function used in the theory of the rotating superfluids @xcite given by the converging series @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a complex coordinate on 2d plain , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the minimal complex periods @xcite of the vortex lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the phase factor @xmath15 will be simple function on 2d plain if @xmath16 and @xmath17 with integer @xmath18 of any sign . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath18 and the periods @xmath13 , @xmath14 define the topological class of multiparticle wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the transformed hamiltonian ( [ nham ] ) can not be restored to the initial form ( [ ham ] ) by any smooth finite transformation of the function @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> that makes it topologically stable . </S>",
    "<S> we shall investigate the pecularities of the ground state and excitations for this model at low temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> having in mind large magnetic fields it is interesting to consider the simplified version of the hamiltonian ( [ nham ] ) without the interaction term @xmath20 ^ 2\\chi d^2r.\\ ] ]    this hamiltonian has properties close to the hamiltonian with a constant magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the translation on any period @xmath21 of the vortex lattice gives an additional constant in the brackets @xmath22\\to   \\\\   [ -i{\\bf \\nabla}+&{\\bf \\nabla}\\alpha-\\frac{e}{c\\hbar}{\\bf a}({\\bf r})+   { \\vec \\delta}({\\vec \\tau})-\\frac{e}{c \\hbar}{\\bf a}(\\vec \\tau ) ] ,   \\end{split }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] due to the properties of weierstrass function @xmath23 and the linear dependence of the external vector potential @xmath24 at constant magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the additonal constant terms can be removed by the gauge transformation of the field operators @xmath2 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the proper magnetic translation does not change hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if we introduce the `` effective '' vector potential @xmath25 , the magnetic translation is given by the transformation @xmath26 for any real period of the vortex lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to connect @xmath27 with the `` effective '' magnetic flux through the unit cell of the vortex lattice given by the contour along it s boundaries @xmath28 on the other hand it can be calculated directly using the definition of @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the quantum of the flux , @xmath32 is the external magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> as was shown by e.brown ( 1964 ) @xcite , j.zak ( 1964 ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the simple finite representation of the ray group of magnetic translations can be obtained only for rational number of the flux quanta per unit cell , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the area of the unit cell of the vortex lattice , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are integers without common factors .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the situation for the vortex lattices is isomorphous to the case of uniform magnetic field with a rational number of the flux quanta per the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is possible to use all the argumentation following the paper @xcite in constructing of the finite representation for the ray group of magnetic translations . in order to construct </S>",
    "<S> the finite representation one must impose certain boundary conditions on the solutions of schroedinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest is the magnetic periodicity , @xmath37 where @xmath38 define the size of the sample , @xmath39,@xmath40 with integer @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it easy to show that any magnetically translated function @xmath2 according to ( [ mt ] ) will also satisfy ( [ mp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest realization is the vortex lattice consisting of exactly @xmath42 unit cells .    </S>",
    "<S> this conditions is the analog of born - von karman conditions in the absence of magnetic field . indeed in a large enough system the density of states </S>",
    "<S> practically does not depend on the exact form of boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> but the restriction to the finite representations is important .    </S>",
    "<S> the matrices of the representation are @xmath43 and the general matrix of the representation @xmath44     \\delta_{j , k - n_2}\\right\\}(\\rm{mod}\\ ,   n ) .     </S>",

    "<S> the sum of the squares of traces is @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the representation is irreducible . </S>",
    "<S> the square of the dimensionality is also @xmath45 therefore there can be no other nonequivalent representation . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionality of the representation gives @xmath36 fold degeneracy of the energy levels for hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the number of the equivalent representations in a regular representation is also @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> these equivalent representations depend on the choice of the gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the total effective vector potential giving nonzero flux through the unit cell of the vortex lattice with @xmath46 assuming @xmath47 , and the basic periods for the vortex lattice @xmath48 and @xmath49 with both components . </S>",
    "<S> let us take a magnetic cell containing @xmath36 cells in @xmath50 direction and only one cell in the @xmath51 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the states of the crystal of @xmath42 cells can be labelled by the quasimomentum @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the basic vectors of the reciprocal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> there is no translation in @xmath49 direction therefore we can put @xmath54 but there are @xmath55 translations in @xmath51 direction . because @xmath36 translations in that directions must give the phase @xmath56 we must put @xmath57 with @xmath58 . these equivalent representations together with @xmath36 times degeneracy due to the dimension of the representation </S>",
    "<S> give the regular representation of the translation group in @xmath42 cells crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> the limitation to the single magnetic cell @xmath59 can be easy removed by the consideration of the vortex lattices with dimensions @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 for integer @xmath63,@xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the representations of the larger group of @xmath65 operations can be formed from the already discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> for this group there are @xmath66 representations of dimensionality @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrices corresponding to the translations @xmath67,@xmath68 differ from the already given only by a phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> these representations can be labelled by a vector with reciprocal space components of @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 and possible values of @xmath73 are given by @xmath74 in general every vector @xmath75 corresponds to some irreducible representation of the translation group . </S>",
    "<S> the possible domain of @xmath75 is defined by the brilluin zone for the given periodical part of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> for the same gauge with @xmath76 the domain for @xmath77 will be unchanged by the constant part of the effective magnetic field with a nonzero flux . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is @xmath78 different values of the @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> but the domain for @xmath79 can be reduced if one introduces a new unit cell extended in @xmath50 direction with @xmath80 in order to have the integer number of the flux quanta . that reduced @xmath79 domain is @xmath81 smaller then in the basical reciprocal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of the different values for @xmath75 for the irreducible representations inside the reduced brilluin zone will be @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> it must be multiplied by @xmath36 due to the dimensionality of the representation giving @xmath83 various states equal to the number of states in the primary brilluin zone without constant part of the effective magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> that calculation is in a close analogy to the case of zero flux periodical magnetic field where the irreducible representations are abelian one dimensional representations of the translation group instead of the discussed @xmath36 dimensional irreducible representation . because vectors @xmath75 are quasicontinuous inside the reduced brilluin zone </S>",
    "<S> there is no energetical gaps inside this set of the states . </S>",
    "<S> if one takes only a part of this set there will be no energetical gap at the transitions to the rest empty states . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the set of @xmath83 states is divided by some gap from the analogous set with the higher energies like it was for the case of a zero flux periodical ; magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> that must be checked numerically .    at large magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) will be dominating in the full hamiltonian ( [ nham ] ) because it linearly depends on magnetic field while the interaction term is proportional to the square root of it . in this case the energy of the ground state including the interaction can be obtained by the perturbation theory @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the energy for the lowest set of the states giving the irreducible represemtations and the angle brackets denote the average over the slater determinant of the wave functions of the set . </S>",
    "<S> ( fully filled ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap dividing the ground state from the next set of states with the higher energies at large magnetic fields must be proportional to the value of the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in the performed experiments @xcite the linear dependence of the jump for electron chemical potential in a strong magnetic fields was observed for the fractions 1/3 and 2/3 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the gap must be obtained by the numerical calculation of bloch functions for the given representation and is dependent on @xmath18 , @xmath36,@xmath35 and periods @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see that in the model of the vortex lattices the gap does not depend exclusively on the interaction term like it was suggested in most of theoretical works based on the degeneracy of the ground landau level . </S>",
    "<S> opposite , it is almost independent from the interaction in strong magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of this paradox is the same as in the rotating superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the observed vortex lattices in a rotating superfluid is connected with the thermodynamic energy in the rotating frame @xmath87,where @xmath88 is the angular velocity and @xmath89 is the angle momentum of the superfluid . that requires the superfluid velocity to be equal to the velocity of the solid body rotation and the vortex lattice is a good approximation in a superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> really it is connected with a different dependence of the energy on the size of the system giving the preference to the solid body rotation irrespective to the microscopical internal structure of the superfluid .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous group analysis valid for a rational number of the flux quanta show that the energy gaps are opened at the special electron densities corresponding to one electron per each unit cell of the vortex lattice , that gives according to eq.([phi ] ) the electron density @xmath90 and must correspond to the filled set of bands obtained from @xmath91 states in the absence of the average magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath92 is the sample area . </S>",
    "<S> simple analysis states @xcite that this initial band is split into @xmath93 subbands , each being ( odd @xmath93 ) @xmath93- fold or ( even @xmath93 ) @xmath94-fold degenerate , and with the fraction of the number of states in each subband being ( odd @xmath93)equal to @xmath95 or ( even @xmath93 ) to @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total number of states in all subbands is @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> one can assume that , even in the presence of interaction , these states are separated from the higher - energy states by the greatest gap . </S>",
    "<S> note that the evenness of the @xmath18 number is immaterial , because the fermi commutation rules or the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fulfilled automatically and have no relation to the topological number @xmath18 unlike jain - chern - simons theory . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of any specific numbers of vortex flux quanta can be dictated by the ground - state energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the experimental electron density is defined by the gate voltages or the density of the compensating charge but the observation of the specific hall plato can be dictated by the value of the gap at the given temperature and the purity of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the observed fractions in fqhe correspond to the following tables :    @xmath98    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + as an example in fig . </S>",
