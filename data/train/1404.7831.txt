    ", the potential undergoes an instantaneous expansion ( adiabatic ) by decreasing the stiffness constant from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "as the process is instantaneous the distribution before and after expansion will not change and heat absorption will be zero . in the third step , the system is connected to a cold bath with lower temperature @xmath0 and isothermal compression of the trap is carried out by changing the stiffness as @xmath25 for @xmath26 . in the last step ,",
    "we carry out instantaneous adiabatic compression by varying the stiffness constant from @xmath23 to @xmath22 and simultaneously connecting the system to the hot bath .",

    "work optimized protocol is used by schmiedl and seifert @xcite whereas the protocol based on the concept of shortcut to adiabaticity is used by tu @xcite . however , their emphasis is on the possible correlation between efficiency at maximum power and c - a bound .",
    "our main motivation , namely to study the fluctuation of physical quantities , is different from earlier studies as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in this section , we analytically calculate the average thermodynamic quantities of our model system in the quasistatic limit . in this limit ,",
    "the duration of the protocol is much larger than all the relevant time scales , including the relaxation time .",
    "hence as protocol is changed , the system immediately adjusts to the equilibrium state corresponding to the value of protocol at that instant .",
    "first , we calculate the average work done on the particle in all the four steps of a cycle and the heat absorbed by it in the first isothermal step . finally , we calculate efficiency in the quasistatic limit .    in the first isothermal process ,",

    "the second step being instantaneous , no heat will be dissipated and the phase space distribution remains unaltered . correspondingly the average work done on the particle is equal to the change in its internal energy :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , is the normalization constant . similarly in the third step ( i.e. , isothermal compression step ) the average work done on the particle in the quasistatic limit is @xmath32 the average work done in the last step ( i.e. , second adiabatic step ) is given as @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",

    "the thermodynamic quantities are denoted by capital letters only for quasistatic limit , whereas , small letters are used to denote those quantities for finite time cycles .    according to our convention negative work done on the system implies extraction of work ; while , negative heat means that heat enters into the system .",
    "it is important to note from eq.([eq - q ] ) that in quasistatic limit heat flows from the bath to the system provided @xmath48 and similarly from eq.([eq - w ] ) work can be extracted from the system if @xmath49 therefore , in quasistatic regime our model system operates in three different modes of operation depending on the ratio of the temperatures of the thermal baths .",
    "first , when @xmath50 is maintained , work can be extracted and heat is absorbed from hot bath and it acts as an engine .",
    "second , when @xmath51 is set , heat is absorbed from the bath but we can not extract work . and finally when we have @xmath52 neither heat is absorbed nor the work is extracted",
    ". in this case work done on the system heats up the hot bath .",
    "therefore , there is a particular regime in parameter space where the system act as an engine .",
    "this is in contrast to the carnot engine which works for arbitrary temperature difference between two baths .",
    "the above mentioned condition is only valid in the quasistatic limit . for finite time cycle",

    "similar to the underdamped case , the reliability of the system to act as an engine increases with @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we discuss the performance characteristics of our system in the overdamped regime using an experimental protocol @xcite .",
    "the experimental protocol consists of only two steps , in which the two adiabatic steps of fig.([fig - pro ] ) are absent . in the quasistatic regime",
    "the system acts as an engine for any temperature difference and there is no bound on @xmath1 unlike our four step protocol @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the phase diagram will depend on the nature of protocol as well as on system parameters and is not unique . as discussed earlier ,",
    "most of the work fluctuations specially in quasistatic regime arise from two adiabatic steps . in the absence of these two steps",
    ", we have observed in our simulation that in the quasistatic regime , work distribution @xmath115 is sharply peaked like a delta function at @xmath182 ( analytical result ) @xcite .",
    "however , fluctuations in @xmath44 persist even in the quasistatic regime as a result of the relaxation process that follows when the system , in contact with the cold bath , is brought in direct contact with high temperature reservoir .",
    "the distribution of stochastic efficiency @xmath116 exhibits a qualitative differences .",
    "it has almost zero weight for @xmath183 in large @xmath21 limit and shows a broad double peak feature which is confined in the region @xmath184 . beyond @xmath185 a long tail",

    "we notice that fluctuations dominates over the mean value .",

    "we summarise our results in this section . we have carried out an extensive analysis of a single particle stochastic heat engine by manipulating a brownian particle in a harmonic trap with a periodically time dependent stiffness constant as a protocol .",
    "the cycle consists of two isothermal steps and two adiabatic steps similar to that of carnot engine .",
    "the proposed model is studied taking into account both the inertial and overdamped langevin equations .",
    "thermodynamic quantities , defined over microscopic phase space trajectory of our system , fluctuate from one cycle of operation to another .",
    "their magnitude depends on the trajectory of the particle during the cycle .",
    "this is done by using the methods of stochastic energetics .",
    "average value of thermodynamic quantities and their distribution functions have been calculated numerically in tpss .",
    "analytical results of average thermodynamic quantities have been obtained in the quasistatic regime .",
    "these results are consistent with the corresponding numerical results .",
    "we have reported several new results which were not addressed in earlier literature .",
    "the full phase diagram for operation of a system is given in both inertial and high friction regime .",
    "they differ from each other qualitatively . in both cases",
    "it is also shown that system acts as an engine provided the temperature difference is greater than a critical value ( unlike carnot engine ) .",
    "this critical value depends on system parameters and is consistent with analytical results in quasistatic limit .",
    "moreover , for fixed bath temperatures and system parameters there should be a critical cycle time above which the system acts as an engine .",
    "the mean of the stochastic efficiency is dominated by its fluctuations ( @xmath188 ) even in quasistatic regime , making the efficiency a non - self averaging quantity . for such cases",
    "mean ceases to be a good physical variable and one has to resort to the analysis for full probability distribution .",
    "this is one of our main result .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath189 .",
    "our analysis of model dependence of finite cycle time clearly rules out any simple universal relation ( e.g. , @xmath190 ) between efficiency at maximum power and temperature of the baths .",
    "time asymmetric periodic protocol makes engine less efficient . only in the quasistatic regime time asymmetry",
    "does not play any role .",
    "for given cycle time there are several realizations which do not work as a heat engine .",
    "these are referred to as transient second law violating trajectories .",
    "number of these realizations decreases as we increase @xmath21 .",
    "the fractions of realisations following second law with corresponding @xmath21 are reported earlier sections both in underdamped and overdamped regimes .",
    "thus for large cycle time the reliability of the system working as an engine increases .",
    "persistence of these realizations even in quasistatic regime can be attributed to the fluctuation of heat and work distributions .",
    "fluctuations in work are mainly attributed to two adiabatic processes connecting two isotherms , while fluctuations of @xmath44 result from the relaxation of the system , when brought in direct contact with high temperature reservoir from low temperature bath . .",
    "we have shown that in tpss @xmath55 exhibit strong correlation between variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 in small cycle time limit .",
    "however , it becomes uncorrelated as we approach quasistatic limit . for analytical simplicity",
    "it had been generally assumed in earlier literature that there is no correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath55 ( see for example @xcite ) .    in the inertial regime",
