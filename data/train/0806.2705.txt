    "so far , we have shown how the susy / non - susy duality proposed by aganagic et al . can have a corresponding type iia brane picture .",
    "apart from conventional ones , where anti - branes are wrapped on a cy by hand , the setup here involves changing the orientation of local two - cycles through a varying background ns - flux . this dose work because @xmath10-field gives a khler moduli @xmath11 of arbitrary sign to shrinking two - cycles and hence controls their flops . on type iia side ,",
    "we interpret this background as two crossing ns5-branes where @xmath12-branes appear naturally for flipped orientations .",
    "consequently , simultaneous presence of d4- and @xmath12-branes soon suggests a way to realize various kinds of susy / non - susy vacua via adjusting parameters the ns - flux contains .",
    "moreover , curved ns5-branes on @xmath13-plane with @xmath1 susy correspond to what has been known as the @xmath0 seiberg - witten theory .",
    "one can further add fi parameters to partially break @xmath1 down to @xmath2 . resorting to type iia brane pictures",
    ", we see this process is clearly visualized in figure [ partial susy ] .",
    "the final @xmath2 vacuum is arrived at once the tree - level superpotential @xmath14 takes the form of @xmath15 .",
    "we also considered m - theory lift . without @xmath16 perturbation ,",
    "the m - theory curve itself is either a degenerated seiberg - witten curve on @xmath13-plane or a loop equation of dv matrix model on @xmath17-plane . though adding higher @xmath16 terms has no effect on the planar loop equation , we find that @xmath2 effective superpotential which involves @xmath18-cycles on @xmath13-plane gets modified",
    ". in particular , it seems that the above partial susy breaking process can be described by deforming one given m - theory curve in order to incorporate quantum effects .",
    "it is thus of interest to compare this observation with field theory results found in @xcite .",
    "we leave these problems to future works .",

    "<S> we study the susy / non - susy duality proposed by aganagic et al . from type iia string and m - theory perspectives . we find that our brane configuration generalizes the so - called @xmath0 seiberg - witten theory on the one hand , and provides a way to realize non - susy vacua by intersecting ns5-branes on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue how the partial susy breaking from @xmath1 down to @xmath2 can be clearly visualized through the brane picture .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < \" , ]     finally , we comment on the partial susy breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath2 through the above brane picture . </S>",
    "<S> the partial susy breaking is discussed in @xcite for abelian gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> the non - abelian generalization is well investigated and established by authors of @xcite . according to these early works , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 theory is firstly perturbed by introducing a general prepotential of the form and its susy is broken down to @xmath2 thereof upon adding fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) parameters .    as mentioned throughout this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the prepotential @xmath3 describes how ns5-branes get deformed in @xmath4-space , see figure [ partial susy ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> three fi parameters correspond to the relative position of two ns5-branes in @xmath5-space . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth , turning on fi parameters means that two ns5-branes are separated from each other in @xmath5-space . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a new direction by which the bare coupling constant is measured should be defined due to the presence of fi parameters . in figure [ partial susy ] ( a ) , initial positions of d4-branes are not fixed . </S>",
    "<S> but if d4-branes still remain at their initial positions , they become non - parallel when the curved ns5-brane is pulled along @xmath6 , see figure [ partial susy ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , susy can no longer be maintained for an off - shell choice of @xmath7 vev . </S>",
    "<S> to recover susy , d4-branes should be re - distributed appropriately at critical loci , i.e. @xmath8 ( on - shell condition ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , since susy is recovered to @xmath2 , we can as well recognize the tree - level superpotential as @xmath9 with coefficients rescaled suitably , see figure [ partial susy ] ( c ) . to this end , the partial susy breaking mechanism can thus be understood pictorially from the _ extended _ brane configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> the above argument is valid only for the classical ( uv ) theory . in order to extend this picture to the full quantum theory </S>",
    "<S> , we need to replace the ns5/d4 system with a mqcd curve . pulling out </S>",
    "<S> one ns5-brane then corresponds to deforming the curve . </S>",
    "<S> the projective information of the mqcd curve contains both the _ extended _ sw curve and loop equation ( or , alternatively , generalized konishi anomaly equation ) of @xmath2 theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is interesting to see how these aspects transform according to the partial susy breaking deformation of the curve . </S>"
