    "<S> finds that only @xmath72-regular pair conjugacy classes contribute to the ground state dimension . defining @xmath73 a pair conjugacy class @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> is called @xmath72-regular if for all elements of the centralizer @xmath75 we have @xmath76 details of the derivation are given in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> since states from different pair conjugacy classes are linearly independent we conclude that the ground state degeneracy on a minimal torus is given by the number of @xmath72-regular pair conjugacy classes @xmath74 for which @xmath77=0 $ ] and @xmath78 is fulfilled . in the case </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath79 , i.e. the bosonic case , we obtain a classification of the ground state basis elements in terms of @xmath80-regular pair conjugacy classes as expected from the results of ref .  @xcite . in complete analogy to the bosonic setting the considerations on the minimal torus hold equally well on a torus of arbitrary size due to the axioms of stability under concatenation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fermionic toric code . </S>",
    "<S> _ to illustrate the formalism of fermionic mpo - injective fpeps we will elucidate how the ground state of the fermionic toric code hamiltonian as proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can be written as a fermionic tensor network satisfying the axioms of fermionic mpo - injectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic toric code hamiltonian is given in a string - net description . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen as the simplest solution of the self - consistency equations for fermionic twisted quantum double models , i.e. , the simplest triple @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> the local hilbert space is given by qubits represented by the group @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this group has only two second cohomology classes . choosing the 2-cocycle @xmath36 as a representative of the trivial cohomology class one obtains the usual bosonic toric code or the double semion model depending on the choice of @xmath42 , i.e. , the solution to the pentagon equation which is a usual 3-cocyclce equation in this case . </S>",
    "<S> choosing the non - trivial second cohomology class , in particular the normalized representative @xmath83 corresponds to the rule according to which fermionic creation and annihilation takes place in the fermionc toric code model . </S>",
    "<S> the two normalized solutions to the graded pentagon equation @xmath84 then correspond to the fermionic toric code model or its dual defined by choosing the fusion coefficient @xmath85 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ground state wave function of the fermionic toric code can be written in terms of @xmath58 tensors defined in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ ftc2cocycle ] ) , and ( [ ftcg3cocycle ] ) with the lattice geometry depicted in fig .  [ hex ] which is the dual of the physical lattice from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . by construction </S>",
    "<S> this tensor network is fmpo - injective . to prove that it is indeed the ground state of the fermionic toric code hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> one can verify that the tensor network is an eigenstate to each local projector . </S>",
    "<S> the property of being an eigenstate to the vertex projector is also already implied in the construction of the @xmath58 tensor . to check that the tensor network state is an eigenstate of the plaquette projectors we compute a local patch @xmath86 of the tensor network given in fig .  [ hex ] with open virtual boundary and act with the plaquette operator @xmath11 on the physical indices . </S>",
    "<S> one can use table  [ table_hamiltonian ] stating the matrix elements of @xmath11 explicitly in a suitable gauge to check that @xmath87 intuitively this can be understood by interpreting the plaquette operator as inserting a closed loop around the center of the hexagon . </S>",
    "<S> the contraction of the inner virtual index @xmath88 exactly compensates for that , i , e . , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> note that due to the anti - commutating grassmann variables it is not trivial to see that all sign - factors are indeed correct but it is a result of an explicit calculation . </S>",
    "<S> making use of the translation invariance of the lattice we have successfully verified that the tensor network state is the groundstate on any local region .    to calculate the ground - state degeneracy on a torus we use the formalism developed in the previous section . since @xmath91 is abelian </S>",
    "<S> there are four pair conjugacy classes . </S>",
    "<S> as the cocycle @xmath36 is symmetric the condition @xmath78 is fulfilled as well . </S>",
    "<S> next we check whether @xmath92 which is true for all @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily seen by noting that the ratio is one if any of the elements @xmath93 is equal to @xmath94 and if @xmath95 the ratio is also one , because the supercocycle @xmath42 is symmetric under permutation of the order of its arguments . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , each pair conjugacy class spans one ground - state dimension and the ground - state degeneracy on a torus is four which is in agreement with the result obtained directly on the physical level in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> .    _ summary and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this work , we have introduced a general tensor network formalism that is sufficiently versatile to capture topological order of quantum systems with a fermionic component . </S>",
    "<S> we hence generalise the idea of describing phases of matter using tensor network states to the fermionic realm . yet </S>",
    "<S> , this is only the beginning of an extensive program , needless to say : in future work , instances of symmetry - protected topological order will be discussed , as well as more subtle situations in which a global flow can not be identified @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will also be interesting to grasp modular matrices directly in this framework . </S>",
    "<S> it is the hope that this work can be seen as a further invitation to explore tensor networks to capture topological phases of matter .    _ </S>",
