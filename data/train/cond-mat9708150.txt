    "the insulator - metal ( i m ) transition and the role of electron - electron interaction in this transition is a problem of permanent interest , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that in the systems with strong disorder the interaction is in favor of delocalization because electrons may help each other to overcome the random potential . in clean systems",
    "the role of the interaction is opposite .",
    "it may create the so - called correlated insulator in a system which would be metallic otherwise . the wigner crystal ( wc ) is a good example of such insulator .",
    "wc in continuum is not an insulator itself , since it can move as the whole and carry current .",
    "however , due to shear modulus it can be pinned by a small disorder .",
    "the ground - state energy of the continuum wc and its zero - temperature melting was widely studied in the recent years both with and without magnetic field.@xcite    in contrast to the continuum case , the wc on a lattice can be an insulator without any disorder due to the umklapp processes in a host lattice .",
    "the wc on a lattice does not have any sound or soft plasma modes and its excitation spectrum has a gap .",
    "the great majority of the efforts made recently to study correlated particles on a lattice were restricted to the hubbard model or @xmath2 model ( see review ref .  ) .",
    "the so - called extended hubbard model with short - range and long - range interactions has been mostly considered for bosons in connection to the insulator - superconductor transition.@xcite in these papers supersolid and superfluid phases have been found .",
    "the bosons with infinite on - site repulsion are called hard - core bosons . in the case of the nearest - neighbor interaction the hard - core boson problem maps into ising - heisenberg spin hamiltonian .",
    "spinless fermions are similar to the hard - core bosons . in both systems",
    "the number of particles on a site is either zero or one . in 1d - case",
    "these two systems are equivalent if the interaction between particles does not permit them to penetrate through one another.@xcite    the 1d problem with the nearest - neighbor interaction at half filling is exactly soluble.@xcite this instructive solution shows that the transition is not of the first order and that the i m transition , as detected by the stiffness constant , appears at the same point as the structural transition.@xcite    very few works exist on the extended hubbard model for 2d fermions .",
    "pikus and efros@xcite have performed a computer modeling for 2d spinless fermions with coulomb interaction on a square lattice at filling factors @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "they argue that the lifting of the ground - state degeneracy with increasing @xmath5 is a very good diagnostic of the structural phase transition .",
    "they have also found a similarity between the systems of spinless fermions and hard - core bosons near the transition .    in this paper",
    "we study structural and i m transitions for spinless fermions at @xmath1 and 1/6 . to detect these transitions we use the ground - state splitting and the flux sensitivity@xcite respectively .",
    "the purpose of the work is to take advantage of the exact diagonalization technique and to study the modification of the low - energy part of the spectrum in a wide interval of the hopping amplitude @xmath5 all the way from the classical wc to the free fermion limit .",
    "our results for long - range and short - range interactions suggest a simple picture of the transition .",
    "the transition is related mainly to the modification of the two lowest branches of energy spectrum . at small",
    "@xmath5 these two branches are the wc state and the energy band of the defect with the lowest energy .",

    "we suggest the mechanism of the transition , analyze the role of the size effect in finite - cluster computations , and discuss the possibility that the delocalized phase above the i m transition is superconducting .",

    "we study rectangular clusters @xmath14 with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dimensionless vector potential @xmath15 in the hamiltonian is equivalent to the twist of the boundary conditions by the flux @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the energy spectrum is periodic in @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the period @xmath20 .    as a basis for computations we use many - electron wave functions at @xmath21 in the coordinate representation : @xmath22 .",
    "the total size of the hilbert space is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the area of a system , and @xmath25 is the number of particles .    the basic functions @xmath26 can be visualized as pictures , which we call _ icons_. some lowest energy icons are shown in fig .",
    "the energy of each icon is calculated as a madelung sum , assuming that the icon is repeated periodically over the infinite plane with a compensating homogeneous background .",
    "the icon with the lowest energy is a fragment of the crystal .",

    "the complete set of @xmath28 nontrivial values of * p * can be obtained by restricting * p * to the first brillouin zone of the background lattice .",
    "one wc is represented by a number of icons obtained from each other by the point - group transformations of the background lattice .",
    "note that the total number of allowed values of * p * for the wc is the property of the wc and it remains finite at infinite cluster size .",
    "contrary , an icon representing a point defect in a wc generates all vectors * p*. their total number is equal to the volume @xmath31 of the first brillouin zone of the background lattice .      in the macroscopic system",
    "all the states generated by the wc icon form the ground state degenerate at small @xmath5 .",
    "this degeneracy appears because the effective matrix elements which connect translated wc s are zero in the macroscopic limit .",
    "the total energy as a function of quasimomentum * p * has identical minima at all * p * generated by the wc icons .",
    "the spectra of excitations in the vicinity of these minima are also identical .    the charge density for the state with given quasimomentum * p * ( see eq .",
    "[ func ] ) is always the same at all sites of the host lattice .",
    "however , at small @xmath5 the correlation function indicates a long range order .",
    "any small perturbation , which violates translational invariance , splits the degeneracy in such a way that the ground state describes a single wc with a strong modulation of the charge density .",
    "the lifting of the ground state degeneracy at some critical value @xmath42 indicates a structural phase transition and restoration of the host lattice symmetry .",
    "the flux sensitivity of a macroscopic system is zero at small @xmath5 .",
    "it becomes non - zero at some finite value of @xmath5 which might be different from @xmath42 .",
    "we associate this transition with the i m transition@xcite .    for the finite system the following results can be obtained directly using the perturbation theory with respect to @xmath5 :    \\(i ) the ground state and the lowest excited states have a large common negative shift which is proportional to @xmath43 and to the total number of particles @xmath25 .",
    "this shift is the same for all low - lying states and does not affect the excitation spectrum of the system ;    \\(ii ) at @xmath1 the splitting of the ground state appears in the @xmath25-th order and is proportional to @xmath44 . at other filling factors the degeneracy of the ground state at @xmath21 is larger than two .",
    "the splitting is determined by matrix elements which are proportional to @xmath45 . for each matrix element",
    "the value of @xmath46 is equal to the number of hops necessary to obtain one crystalline structure from another and is proportional to @xmath25 ;    \\(iii ) the flux dependence of the ground state for the flux in @xmath47-direction appears in the @xmath48-th order and is proportional to @xmath49 in 2d case . in 1d",
    "the flux dependence appears in the @xmath25-th order and is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we conclude that both lifting of the ground - state degeneracy and appearance of the flux sensitivity occur very sharply and they can be used as convenient criteria for the structural and the i m transitions respectively .",
    "note that the correlation function is a less sensitive criterion for small clusters@xcite since it does not exhibit sharp behavior in the transition region .",

    "the energy @xmath51 is linear in @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that with increasing @xmath5 in this interval we go all the way from classical icons to free fermions .",
    "the ground state is almost degenerate at small @xmath5 and it splits into two states with increasing @xmath5 . as we have discussed above , this is a manifestation of the structural transition .",

    "the energy splitting between the lowest states with @xmath62 and @xmath54 is also shown . at small @xmath5",

    "the gss is zero . considering interaction as perturbation",

    "these analytical calculations are in a good agreement with the computational results at large @xmath5 given in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , b . in the case of sr interaction",

    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b shows that the dependencies @xmath72 for the lr and sr potentials are almost indistinguishable if all the energy scales for one of them are adjusted 10 times .",
    "this factor is just the ratio of zero-@xmath5 gaps @xmath52 for these two cases .",
    "thus , we come to a conclusion that @xmath42 depends on the type of interaction potential mostly through the value of @xmath52 .",
    "the same applies to the general structure of the low - energy spectrum of the system in the transition region as can be seen from comparison of fig .",

    "the degeneracy is high , however it remains the same in the infinitely large cluster .",
    "the primitive vectors of the wc at @xmath73 can not be obtained from each other by any symmetry operation on the host lattice .",
    "this means that the wc phase belongs to a _",
    "reducible _ representation of the symmetry group of the host lattice . following",
    "landau and lifshitz@xcite , the symmetry reduction in the second - order phase transition should be such that the low - symmetry phase belongs to an irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the high - symmetry phase .",
    "we conclude that the single second order phase transition is forbidden in this case . however , it can occur as a series of transitions , each reducing the symmetry one step further .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ fig4]a reminds the picture of multiple transitions .",
    "we think that each splitting of the energy levels generated by the wc icon manifests a structural transition .",
    "the cluster @xmath74 is too small to distinguish the critical intervals for each of these transitions .",
    "we can only conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , b that the critical interval @xmath65 for all of the structural transitions and i m transition is 0.010.03 .",
    "this interval is shown by vertical bars in fig .",
    "our data suggest the following mechanism of the transition .",
    "the width of the band of the lowest defect in the wc increases with @xmath5 such that its lowest edge comes close to the energy of the ground state@xcite ( see figs .  [ fig2]a , b , [ fig4]a , and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "strong mixing between the crystalline and defect states with the same quasimomentum occurs at this point .",
    "the avoided crossing appears between the ground state and the states in the defect band .",
    "one can interpret the avoided crossing in terms of the ground state which acquires a large admixture of defect states .",
    "this interpretation reminds the idea of zero - point defectons proposed by andreev and lifshitz.@xcite    in principle , one can imagine that the state with a quasimomentum * p * different from those generated by the wc icon becomes the ground state via a branch crossing .",
    "however , in all cases we have considered , we observe the avoided crossing between the crystalline state and the state in the defect band with the same * p*. assuming that this is the case for larger clusters , we conclude that the phase transition is not of the first order",
    ".    the proposed mechanism of the transition can be illustrated by the dependence @xmath75 at given @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , in 2d case the number of discreet values of * p * along any line in the first brillouin zone is small even for the largest 2d system we study . to clarify our understanding of the transition it is instructive to analyze the data for 1d systems .",
    "we have considered 1d systems with the nearest and next - nearest neighbor interaction@xcite and the system with lr interaction . in the latter case",
    "we study hamiltonian eq .  ( [ ham ] ) at filling factor @xmath1 and @xmath76 . in 1d",
    "we switch from the homogeneous background to the chain with @xmath77 charges for the empty and occupied sites respectively .    fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the results for the flux sensitivity vs. @xmath5 for different system sizes @xmath78 .",
    "the sharp exponential behavior indicates that the system becomes an insulator at small @xmath5 .",
    "this result clearly contradicts to the statement by poilblanc et al .",
    "@xcite that 1d coulomb system is metallic at all @xmath5 .",
    "an extrapolation to @xmath79 shown in the inset gives a rather wide interval for @xmath42 of the i m transition between 0.17 and 0.3 .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows few lowest eigenvalues for each quantized value of @xmath80 for a cluster of 28 sites with 14 particles .",
    "note that the spectrum has nontrivial symmetry around the points @xmath81 .",
    "this symmetry appears for even @xmath25 at @xmath1 as a result of the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "for even @xmath25 the wc icon generates two states with quasimomenta @xmath81 , which are degenerate at all @xmath5 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , at @xmath82 these states are separated by a gap from the continuum of states , generated by the icon of the point defect . at @xmath83",
    "the defect band broadens and , as a result , the gap decreases . however , the lowest eigenvalue at @xmath81 is still separated from the defect band , whereas the second eigenvalue belongs to it . at this point",
    "an avoided crossing starts to develop and the width of the gap remains almost unchanged from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . in the latter case , the lowest eigenvalue is no longer a separated point , but rather can be ascribed to the band . at @xmath85",
    "it becomes quite clear that the lowest eigenvalue belongs to the continuum spectrum .",
    "finally , the picture at @xmath86 is almost a picture for free fermions with the fermi momentum @xmath87 and with the lowest branch @xmath88 close to @xmath89 .",
    "the proposed mechanism of the transition implies that critical value of @xmath5 is determined by the energy @xmath52 of the lowest defect at @xmath21 .",
    "our 2d results are summarized in the table 1 .",
    "it shows for comparison the middle point @xmath90 of the critical interval @xmath65 and the zero-@xmath5 gap @xmath52 for all cases we have studied .",
    "one can see that both @xmath90 and @xmath52 changes by a factor of 10 depending on the filling factor and the type of the interaction potential .",
    "however their ratio @xmath91 is almost constant and is close to 0.5 in all cases .",

    "as can be expected from table 1 , the energy @xmath52 of the lowest excited state at @xmath21 may have much influence on @xmath90 .",
    "we show here that @xmath52 may have a strong size dependence in small clusters .",
    "this kind of a size effect can be called `` classical . ''",
    "the sr and lr potentials are very different in this aspect . in the case of sr interaction",
    "the defect with the lowest energy is the point defect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath52 on the cluster size is only due to the interaction of the defect with its images , which appear as a result of the periodic boundary conditions .    in the case of lr interaction the energy",
    "@xmath52 depends strongly on the size of the cluster for relatively small clusters .",
    "this dependence becomes stronger for smaller filling factors .",

    "however , for large enough clusters new dislocations seize to appear , so that @xmath52 does not decrease .",
    "since the energy of a dislocation is proportional to the size of the cluster , the point defect should win the competition in large enough clusters .    for @xmath1 and 1/3",
    "the point defect becomes the lowest excited state starting with the sizes @xmath74 and @xmath96 respectively . for @xmath97 and @xmath4",
    "we are unable to find this critical size .",
    "however , the increase of @xmath52 with @xmath78 assures that the point defect should eventually become the lowest excited state .",
    "our conclusion is that in the case of lr interaction one should expect a significant size effect in @xmath90 due to the classical size effect in @xmath52 .      since the classical size effect is negligible for the sr interaction we can analyze the `` quantum '' contribution to the size effect in @xmath90 comparing the results for different clusters .",
