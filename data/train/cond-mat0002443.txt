    "in physics , the idea of localisation is generally associated with disorder that breaks translational invariance .",
    "however , research in recent years has demonstrated that localisation can occur in the absence of any disorder and solely due to nonlinearity , in the form of _ intrinsic localised modes _ , also called _",
    "discrete breathers_.@xcite a rigorous proof of the existence of time - periodic , spatially localised solutions describing such nonlinear modes has been presented for a broad class of hamiltonian coupled - oscillator nonlinear lattices,@xcite but approximate analytical solutions can also be found in many other cases , demonstrating a generality of the concept of _ nonlinear localised modes_.    nonlinear localised modes can be easily identified in numerical molecular - dynamics simulations in many different physical models ( see , e.g. , ref . for a review ) , but only very recently the first experimental observations of spatially localised nonlinear modes have been reported in mixed - valence transition metal complexes,@xcite quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnetic chains,@xcite and arrays of josephson junctions.@xcite importantly , very similar types of spatially localised nonlinear modes have been experimentally observed in _ macroscopic _ mechanical @xcite and guided - wave optical @xcite systems .",
    "recent experimental observations of nonlinear localised modes , as well as numerous theoretical results , indicate that both effects , i.e. nonlinearity - induced localisation and spatially localised modes , can be expected in physical systems of very different nature . from the viewpoint of possible practical applications , self - localised states in optics seem to be the most promising ones ; they can lead to different types of nonlinear all - optical switching devices where light manipulates and controls light itself , by varying the input intensity . as a result",
    ", the study of nonlinear localised modes in photonic structures is expected to bring a variety of realistic applications of intrinsic localised modes .",
    "one of the promising fields where the concept of nonlinear localised modes may find practical applications is in the physics of _ photonic crystals _ [ or photonic band gap ( pbg ) materials ]  periodic dielectric structures that produce many of the same phenomena for photons as the crystalline atomic potential does for electrons.@xcite three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic crystals for visible light have been successfully fabricated only within the past year or two , and presently many research groups are working on creating tunable band - gap switches and transistors operating entirely with light .",
    "the most recent idea is to employ nonlinear properties of band - gap materials , thus creating _ nonlinear photonic crystals _ that have 2d or 3d periodic nonlinear susceptibility.@xcite    nonlinear photonic crystals or photonic crystals with embedded nonlinear impurities create an ideal environment for the generation and observation of nonlinear localised photonic modes . in particular ,",
    "such modes can be excited at nonlinear interfaces with quadratic nonlinearity,@xcite or along dielectric waveguide structures possessing a nonlinear kerr - type response.@xcite in this paper , we analyse nonlinear localised modes in 2d photonic crystal waveguides .",
    "we consider the waveguides created by an array of dielectric rods in an otherwise perfect 2d photonic crystal .",
    "it is assumed that the dielectric constant of the waveguide rods depends on the field intensity ( due to the kerr effect ) , so that waveguides of different geometries can support a variety of nonlinear guided modes .",
    "we demonstrate here that localisation can occur in the propagation direction creating a 2d spatially localised mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sol2d ] below ) .",
    "as follows from our results , the effective interaction in such nonlinear waveguides is nonlocal , and the nonlinear localised modes are described by a nontrivial generalisation of nonlinear lattice models with long - range coupling and nonlocal nonlinearity .",

    "as follows from the structure of the frequency spectrum , there exists a large ( 38% ) band gap that extends from the lower cut - off frequency , @xmath20 , to the upper band - gap frequency , @xmath21 . since the characteristics of a pbg material remain unchanged under rescaling , we can assume that this gap is created either in the infra - red or visible regions of the spectrum .",
    "for example , if we choose the lattice constant to be @xmath22 m , the wavelength corresponding to the mid - gap frequency will be @xmath23 m .",
    "the tm - polarised light can not propagate through the photonic crystal if its frequency falls inside the band gap .",

    "however , the analytical approach developed by mcgurn for that model did not take into account the field distribution via the explicit dependence of the coupling coefficients @xmath44 and , as a result , the equation ( [ sys : eq - e - disc ] ) was not solved exactly . moreover , the analysis of ref . was based on the nearest - neighbour approximation where the coupling coefficients are approximated as @xmath45 with constant @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    in a sharp contrast , in the present paper we provide a systematic numerical analysis of different types of nonlinear localised modes in the framework of a complete model .",
    "in particular , we reveal that the approximation of the nearest - neighbour interaction is very crude in many of the cases analysed .",
    "since the effective coupling coefficients are defined by the green function , this can be seen directly from fig .",

    "this result allows us to draw an analogy with a class of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations that describe nonlinear excitations in quasi - one - dimensional molecular chains with long - range ( e.g. dipole - dipole ) interaction between the particles and local on - site nonlinearities.@xcite for such systems , it was shown that the effect of nonlocal interparticle interaction introduces some new features in the properties of existence and stability of nonlinear localised modes .",
    "moreover , for our model the coupling coefficients @xmath44 can be either non - staggered and monotonically decaying , i.e. @xmath55 , or staggered and oscillating from site to site , i.e. @xmath56 .",

    "we have solved eq .",
    "( [ sys : eq - e - disc ] ) numerically and found that nonlinearity can lead to the existence of a new type of guided modes which are localised in both directions , i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the waveguide , due to the guiding properties of a channel created by defect rods , and in the direction of the waveguide , due to the self - trapping effect .",

    "similar to the results earlier obtained for the nonlocal nls models @xcite , we can expect here that nonlinear localised modes corresponding , in our notations , to the positive slope of the derivative @xmath70 are unstable and will eventually decay or transform into modes of higher or lower frequency .",
    "such a phenomenon is known as _ bistability _ , and in this problem it occurs as a direct manifestation of the nonlocality of the effective ( linear and nonlinear ) interaction between the defect rod sites .",
