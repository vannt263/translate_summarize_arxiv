    "non - gaussianity ( ng ) in primordial curvature perturbation is a key observational probe to study physics in early universe .",

    "variants of the simple inflationary models generate much higher levels of ng : multiple fields @xcite ; modulated reheating scenarios @xcite ; warm inflation @xcite ; ekpyrotic model @xcite .",
    "these ngs have been constrained using the cubic - order statistics ( i.e. , bispectrum ) from cmb temperature maps of wmap @xcite .",
    "so far ng analysis has been mainly focused on the measurement of primordial bispectrum .",
    "primordial trispectrum , the next higher - order term , also provides an important probe to differentiate inflation models .",
    "trispectrum is generally described into two different kinds of connected parts and their amplitudes is commonly parametrized by @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "full analysis of trispectrum is computationally very expensive because their number of configurations are enormous .",
    "minkowski functionals ( mfs ) are another powerful tool to constrain ngs from the aspect of morphological properties of the density structure .",
    "mfs and polyspectrum such as bispectrum and trispectrum are very different statistics .",
    "mfs are real - space statistics , whereas the polyspectrum is defined in harmonic space .",
    "mfs naturally incorporate the information of all orders of polyspectra and thus they are complementary to the commonly used measurement using polyspectra . according to the perturbative formulae of mfs derived by @xcite , the higher - order ng originated from primordial trispectrum is characterized with four kurtosis parameters , which is the summation over trispectrum with different weights on tetrahedron configuration .",
    "the computation of kurtosis parameters is much less expensive compared to the trispectrum estimator .",
    "mfs are model - independent statistics and hence they have a potential to serendipitously find ngs due to unknown sources that has not been explored .",
    "consistency check using different estimators from the standard one is thereby important to obtain more robust results .    in this paper , we first apply the perturbative formulae of mfs upto 2nd - order derived by @xcite to wmap 7-year data of cmb temperature anisotropies .",
