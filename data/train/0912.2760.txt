    "the properties of small metal clusters have enjoyed considerable interest in recent years .",
    "cluster properties can differ enormously from those of the bulk material due to the large surface - to - volume ratio and due to a remarkable sensitivity of the electronic structure to the cluster size and geometry.@xcite these properties are of interest in technological applications , e.  g.  for catalysis .",
    "@xcite from a conceptual point of view clusters pose fundamental questions in statistical mechanics of finite systems.@xcite    the melting process of small clusters is a complex phenomenon , the detailed rules of which are poorly understood . from early on it has been associated with isomer fluctuations @xcite .",
    "more recent investigations of _ isolated _ ni@xmath4al@xmath5 alloy clusters @xcite elucidate the relation between isomer fluctuations and the increase of entropy across the melting transition . a detailed overview about how the phase space grows with increasing particle number and the classification of isomers in terms of potential energy surfaces is given in ref .",
    "a general overview of structural properties of nanoclusters is found in ref .  .",
    "by contrast , the understanding of the melting of very large clusters and bulk materials is considerably better developed .",
    "it is believed to be a strongly inhomogeneous process . in large , free metal clusters",
    "melting starts in the outermost atom shell , at the interface to the vacuum , because there the thermal fluctuations of the particle density have the lowest energy cost.@xcite by feeding more heat into the cluster melting peals off shells from the solid cluster core , layer by layer . following this logic ,",
    "one concludes that melting in principle is a continuous transition  to the extent that each one of the individual layers carries its own melting temperature . for atomic clusters",
    "this is the rule rather than the exception , because typically each layer has its own atomistic structure .",
    "this behavior is reflected in the temperature dependence of the specific heat , @xmath6 , which is not necessarily a very sharply peaked function of temperature ( as is the case for bulk samples ) , but rather may exhibit a strong inhomogeneous broadening which reflects inter - shell averaging . a historical overview on `` continuous melting '' is given in ref .",
    "depending on the crystal orientation @xcite , the surface may melt already at temperatures well _ below _ the bulk melting point @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the molten layer is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "it increases continuously with increasing temperature and eventually it diverges  by definition  at the bulk melting temperature .",
    "( it is assumed here , that the thermodynamic state of the cluster interior is unique , i.  e. it becomes independent of geometry in the thermodynamic limit . )",
    "these observations can be treated theoretically in model calculations using different effective potentials @xcite as well as phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "coming back to small systems , this dependency of melting on surface crystallography suggests that surface melting phenomena in atomic clusters should exhibit pronounced size effects , i.  e. the melting behavior of two clusters , that differ in size only by one atom , can vary significantly . in particular , the ( atomic ) structure of closed ( atom ) shell clusters ( magic clusters ) is very sensitive to the addition of ad - atoms or vacancies @xcite .",
    "our paper offers a systematic study of selected al clusters in a range @xmath7 near their melting transition . here , @xmath0 is small enough , so that a simple extrapolation based on a the continuum theory is not applicable and new physics should emerge .",
    "our most crucial observation formulated in general terms : consider splitting the free energy of an @xmath0-atom cluster into a bulk and a surface contribution @xmath8 both terms , @xmath9 , depend on geometrical details of the cluster , i.  e. we expect them to become strictly independent of @xmath0 only in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "formally , @xmath9 are related to two reservoirs , called surface and bulk , with their own specific free energies .",
    "the reservoirs are coupled in the sense of the grand canonical ensemble , so they can exchange energy and particles . from this point of view",
    ", there is no reason why surface and bulk should have the same , or even a similar , melting temperature .",
    "@xcite a reason why in metal clusters both temperatures tend to be strongly correlated with one another , nevertheless , is that the interatomic forces at the surface and inside the bulk are similar .    based on monte - carlo simulations employing semi - empirical gupta potentials , we propose a general mechanism that can lead to a considerable splitting of the surface and bulk melting temperatures .",
    "consider a closed shell cluster , e.  g. al@xmath11 or al@xmath12 , with icosahedral symmetry .",
    "the outer shell of the ih@xmath12 can accommodate an additional atom , an `` impurity interstitial '' , by replacing the fivefold ring structure surrounding an edge atom by a sixfold _",
    "rosettelike _ ring .",
    "the formation of rosettelike structural excitations has been introduced already as a route to amorphisation of ih@xmath12 systems@xcite , and we propose that is relevant for the binding of adatoms in ih@xmath13 and as well .",
    "the impurity is mobile at the surface and its motion strongly assists surface melting .",
    "this is , because the atoms inside the meandering deformation field are pushed away from their favorite high symmetry , low energy site into a more shallow potential well at intermediate position .",
    "our explicit calculations strongly suggest , that by this mechanism the self diffusion of surface atoms can be dramatically enhanced indicating a significant reduction in the activation barrier for diffusion and similarly also of the surface melting temperature .",
    "since impurities do not enter the next ( second one counted from outside to inside ) cluster shell , there is no corresponding reduction there , so that only two different melting transitions should be discriminated .",
    "this effect may have been seen in two recent experiments .",
    "et al._@xcite have determined the latent heat and the melting entropy of sodium clusters , na@xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "their modeling of the data provides an excellent phenomenological description _ assuming _ the premelting of the cluster surface for non - magical @xmath0-values . the microscopic mechanism , that is responsible for this lowering of the surfaces melting temperature , remained unspecified , however . in subsequent theoretical work the experimental melting temperatures",
    "have been reproduced quantitatively for a selected set of clusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the microscopics of premelting of sub - magic clusters has been already understood in terms of the diffusion of vacancies @xcite .",
    "still , the effect of ad - atoms has not been explicitly analyzed , and the relation to elasticity theory ( strain ) remained unexplored .",
    "also , the specific heat of aluminum cluster cations has been measured recently in the interval @xmath16 by multicollision induced dissociation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the specific heat data for a number of clusters shows signatures of multiple transitions , which have tentatively been interpreted as solid - liquid transitions at the surface that occur below the onset of melting.@xcite",
    "to calculate the thermodynamics of an @xmath0-atom metal cluster , we employ a mc simulation in the canonical ensemble .",

    "the potential energy of the metal cluster can efficiently be modeled by effective many - body potentials .",

    "the two body term @xmath44 takes a value @xmath45 in the @xmath46th mc step .",
    "\\(ii ) one may also introduce the rms pair index @xmath47 to study the mc time evolution .",
    "the interest in this quantity stems from the following very general observation : consider a configuration space for an @xmath0-body system which has the property , that several regions exist where the free energy takes ( local ) minima .",
    "after a transient time interval ( `` warm up '' or partial equilibration period ) the mc dynamics starts to explore one of these minima .",
    "there will be a typical time scale ( corresponding to an activation energy ) involved , after which the entire @xmath0-body system migrates to a second , competing minimum where the procedure repeats itself .",

    "the delicate interplay between the special geometry of al@xmath12 and the low activation barrier for ad - atom diffusion in al@xmath13 and al@xmath99 does not prompt the expectation , that this specific mechanism is ubiquitous in all its details . nevertheless , there is a lesson to be learned about the more general case .",
    "one expects a lowering of the activation energy for surface diffusion of surface atoms of clusters with structures that derive from high symmetry parent states either by ( i ) punching in vacancies or ( ii ) by inserting ad - atoms into its outer shell . in such systems , there is a possibility for atomic motions , which are not just ring exchanges and which also do not require to break chemical bonds to first create a vacancy . since low diffusion barriers are also indicative of low melting temperatures , here is a mechanism by which surface melting may become a process that should be distinguished , in principle , from the melting of the bulk .",

    "we mention that the al@xmath121 clusters with @xmath122 and @xmath123 have maxima of the specific heat at temperatures larger than the al bulk melting temperature of @xmath124 .",
    "this observation is in line with the empirical investigation of the melting of small sn@xcite and ga@xcite clusters , which have revealed a possible stability of the solid phase of the particles beyond the melting temperature of the bulk material . in these cases",
    "the high cluster melting temperature was interpreted as a consequence of the rigidity of the specific ground state structures of the clusters .",
    "this interpretation found support from microcanonical molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations for c , si , ge , and sn clusters@xcite as well as for isokinetic md investigations of sn@xmath125@xcite and ga@xmath11 , ga@xmath126@xcite particles .",
    "we briefly touch upon the limit of large clusters , @xmath127 .",
    "there , we observe that @xmath128 , while @xmath69 does not appear to follow this trend . to understand this behavior , recall that @xmath84 is the temperature at which our mc time has become long enough , so we can observe an exchange of particles between the outer shell and its inner neighbor .",
    "then , @xmath129 implies that intershell exchange can not be observed  even with our very long observation times  unless we actually heat up the entire cluster to melt .",
    "this behavior is consistent with what one would expect for a macroscopic single crystal grain : as long as the crystalline structure of the surface is intact ( @xmath130 ) one has @xmath131 and interlayer - diffusion is strongly suppressed .",
    "however , after melting the surface layer no longer forces the atoms of its neighboring inner shell into a crystalline structure . hence , intra self diffusion within the second layer becomes ( almost ) as cheap energetically as was diffusion in the first layer , before .",
    "therefore , the second layer melts immediately after the first one , so at melting one has for the `` effective '' activation energies : @xmath132 . in other words : we recover the standard `` continuous melting '' scenario .",
    "in this paper we have argued , that certain metal clusters with an intermediate size may exhibit a property that can not be found in bulk materials : the activation energies for surface diffusion , @xmath76 , and interlayer diffusion , @xmath85 , are substantially different from one another : @xmath133 . since these activation energies are closely tied to melting temperatures , one expects that the outermost surface layer can exhibit its own melting transition , which is well separated from the bulk .",
    "the continuous melting of the cluster core should start only at much higher temperatures .",
    "the most dramatic decrease of @xmath76 has been found with al@xmath13 . in this case",
    ", it is the `` frustration '' of atomic bonds that originates from implanting an ad - atom into a closed shell system , which produces the effect .",
    "a related mechanism leads to a decrease in the surface melting temperature also for al@xmath66 and is expected to be active in clusters , where @xmath0 is slightly above some magical ( closed atom shell ) value @xmath134 .",
    "we mention , that a distortion of the outer cluster shell is also present in clusters with @xmath0 slightly below @xmath134",
    ". however , a hole is usually accommodated more easily than an ad - atom and therefore the decrease tends to be asymmetric : it is typically stronger for @xmath135 as compared to @xmath136 .",
    "monatomic , macroscopic and planar metal surfaces , that face the vacuum , do not easily allow for the frustration of surface bonds that we have observed with the metal clusters .",
    "an attempt to locally implant concentration of ad - atoms into macroscopic surfaces beyond a certain threshold would result in a metastable state that eventually would transform into another state without frustration , where the ad - atoms would have undergone island formation .",
    "on the other hand , our research suggests the design of materials with a surface melting temperature that is strongly diminished and separates from the bulk melting temperature by a controllable amount .",
    "the idea is to employ a monatomic core and a biatomic shell structure .",
    "the purpose of pressing foreign atoms into the outermost layer of the host material s crystal is to create local strain fields .",
    "since strain reduces the local melting temperature , heating up such a system could create puddles of molten host material on top of the solid , bulk core .",
    "clearly , the combination of host and implantation materials should satisfy at least two conditions : ( i ) the implantations should have a high solubility in the host material , but ( ii ) they should not easily diffuse away from the surface into the bulk of the crystal , either . whether indeed a combination of suitable materials can be found ,",
    "this we have to leave for future research .",
