    "in stochastic analysis for diffusion processes , the bismut formula @xcite ( also known as bismut  elworthy  li formula due to @xcite ) and the integration by parts formula are two fundamental tools .",
    "let , for instance , @xmath0 be the ( nonexplosive ) diffusion process generated by an elliptic differential operator on a riemannian manifold @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 be the associated markov semigroup . for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the bismut formula is of type @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the diffusion process starting at point @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a random variable independent of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the directional derivative along @xmath11 .",
    "when the curvature of the diffusion operator is bounded below , this formula is available with @xmath8 explicitly given by @xmath11 and the curvature operator .",
    "there exist a number of applications of this formula , in particular , letting @xmath12 be the density ( or heat kernel ) of @xmath2 w.r.t .",
    "a nice reference measure @xmath13 , we have , formally , @xmath14 from ( [ 1.1 ] ) one may also derive gradient - entropy estimates of @xmath2 and thus , the following harnack inequality introduced in @xcite ( see @xcite ) : @xmath15\\\\[-10pt ] \\eqntext{t>0 , p>1 , x , y\\in m , f\\in b_b(m),}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is determined by moments of @xmath17 and thus , independent of  @xmath9 .",
    "this type of harnack inequality is a powerful tool in the study of contractivity properties , functional inequalities and heat kernel estimates ; see , for example , @xcite  and references within .    on the other hand , to characterize the derivative of @xmath12 in @xmath18 , which is essentially different from that in @xmath7 when @xmath2 is not symmetric w.r.t .",
    "@xmath13 , we need to establish the following integration by parts formula ( see @xcite ) : @xmath19 for a smooth vector field @xmath11 and some random variable @xmath20 . combining this formula with ( [ 1.1 ] ) ,",
    "we are able to estimate the commutator @xmath21 which is important in the study of flow properties ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) , inequality ( [ 1.3 ] ) can be used to derive a formula for @xmath22 and the shift harnack inequality of type @xmath23 \\bigr ) ( x ) \\mathrm{e}^{c_p(t , x , y ) } , \\nonumber\\\\[-10pt]\\\\[-10pt ] \\eqntext{t>0 , p>1 , x , y\\in m , f\\in b_b(m),}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , is the exponential map on the riemannian manifold . differently from usual harnack inequalities like ( [ 1.2 ] ) , in ( [ 1.4 ] ) the reference function @xmath9 , rather than the initial point , is shifted .",
    "this inequality will lead to different heat kernel estimates from known ones implied by ( [ 1.2 ] ) .    before moving on ,",
    "let us make a brief comment concerning the study of these two formulas .",
    "the bismut formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) has been widely studied using both malliavin calculus and coupling argument ; cf . @xcite and references within .",
    "although ( [ 1.3 ] ) also has strong potential of applications , it is , however , much less known in the literature due to the lack of efficient tools . to see that ( [ 1.3 ] )",
    "is harder to derive than ( [ 1.1 ] ) , let us come back to @xcite where an explicit version of ( [ 1.3 ] ) is established for the brownian motion on a compact riemannian manifold . unlike the bismut formula which only relies on the ricci curvature , driver s integration by parts formula involves both the ricci curvature and its derivatives .",
    "therefore , one can imagine that in general ( [ 1.3 ] ) is more complicated ( and hence harder to derive ) than ( [ 1.1 ] ) .    to establish the integration by parts formula and the corresponding shift harnack inequality in a general framework , in this paper we propose a new coupling argument .",
    "in contrast to usual coupling arguments where two marginal processes start from different points and meet at some time ( called the coupling time ) , for the new - type coupling the marginal processes start from the same point , but their difference reaches a fixed quantity at a given time .    in the next section , we will introduce some general results and applications on the integration by parts formula and the shift harnack inequality using the new coupling method . the general result obtained in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "will be then applied in section  [ sec3 ] to a class of degenerate diffusion processes , in section  [ sec4 ] to delayed sdes and in section  [ sec5 ] to semi - linear spdes .",
    "we remark that the model considered in section  [ sec3 ] goes back to the stochastic hamiltonian system , for which the bismut formula and the harnack inequalities have been investigated in @xcite by using both coupling and malliavin calculus .",
    "as will be shown in section  [ sec2.1 ] with a simple example of this model , for the study of the integration by parts formula and the shift harnack inequalities , the malliavin calculus can be less efficient than the new coupling argument .",
    "in section  [ sec2.1 ] we first recall the argument of coupling by change of measure introduced in @xcite for the harnack inequality and the bismut formula , and then explain how can we modify the coupling in order to derive the integration by parts formula and the shift harnack inequality , and introduce the malliavin calculus for the study of the integration by parts formula . in the second subsection we present some applications of the integration by parts formula and the shift harnack inequalities to estimates of the heat kernel and its derivatives .    for a measurable space @xmath25 ,",
