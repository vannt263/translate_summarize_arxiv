    "recently a lot of efforts have been devoted to the study of spin dynamics and spin transport in semiconductor nano - structures in order to realize the spintronic device.@xcite in @xmath10-type zinc - blende semiconductors , electron spins are randomized by the dresselhaus and/or the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) which acts as an effective magnetic field @xmath11 with its direction and magnitude depending on the electron momentum @xmath12.@xcite in spatial homogeneous system the spin evolution is characterized by the spin relaxation time @xmath7 which describes the decay rate of spin polarization ; the steady - state spin transport is characterized mainly by the spin injection / diffusion length @xmath8,@xcite while the transient spin propagation is characterized by spin diffusion coefficient @xmath4.@xcite the relations among these three parameters and other parameters such as momentum relaxation time @xmath13 , charge diffusion coefficient @xmath14 and mobility @xmath15 have been actively discussed .",
    "it is understood that spin relaxation / dephasing is induced by the inhomogeneous broadening due to the soc together with the ( spin conserving ) scattering.@xcite the scattering provides a channel to speed up the spin dephasing but also slows down the spin dephasing by weakening the inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite the competing effects of scattering have different results on spin dephasing in different conditions . in weak soc or strong scattering regime , the out - of - plane spin relaxation time",
    "is expected to be @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath17 not only includes the contribution from conventional momentum scattering mechanisms such as electron - impurity and electron - phonon scattering , but also includes the contribution from electron - electron coulomb scattering which does not directly affect the charge transport properties.@xcite as for the steady - state spin injection problem , by assuming that the spin dynamics can be separated into two independent processes , spin diffusion and spin relaxation , the spin polarization is expected to decay exponentially along the injection direction with decay `` rate '' , i.e. , the spin injection length , @xmath9 , where @xmath4 and @xmath7 are two phenomenal parameters whose relations with other properties are yet to be determined.@xcite however in the presence of the soc , it has been proved that this assumption is oversimplified . by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations",
    ", it is shown that the effective magnetic field due to the soc alone causes the electron spin to process in real space even in diffusive regime.@xcite the spin polarization varies in the space as @xmath18 instead of simple exponential decay .",
    "the spin injection length @xmath8 and the spatial oscillation `` period '' @xmath19 are obtained by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations,@xcite the spin transport equations which include the contribution of the soc@xcite or the linear response theory.@xcite in the diffusive regime , @xmath8 and @xmath19 can be expressed by soc strength and momentum scattering time.@xcite as for the spin diffusion coefficient , it was widely assumed to be the same as the charge diffusion coefficient .",
    "later it was pointed out that spin coulomb drag ( scd ) , caused by the electron - electron coulomb scattering , should suppress the relative motion of electrons with different spins and thus reduce @xmath4.@xcite    a direct measurement of spin diffusion coefficient can be carried out by transient spin grating ( tsg ) experiments.@xcite with the assumption that spin diffusion and spin relaxation are independent of each other , the decay rate of tsg was written as @xmath20 , where @xmath2 is the wave - vector of the spin grating.@xcite however , from the lesson of steady - state spin injection one learns that the spin diffusion and relaxation are not separable even in the diffusive regime .",
    "this is further justified by the fact that the decay of tsg can be fitted to a double - exponential form instead of single exponential one.@xcite it is therefore still a question of how to get spin diffusion coefficient through tsg experiments .    in this article",
    "we study the temporal evolution of the tsg by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations .",
    "this paper is organized as following : in sec .",
    "[ kineticequation ] we first set up the kinetic spin bloch equations and apply them to solve the tsg problem .",
    "then we show the analytical solution of simplified equations and the numerical results of the full kinetic spin bloch equations . in sec .",
    "[ statictransport ] we study the relations among the spin relaxation time @xmath7 of a spatially homogeneous system , the spin injection length @xmath8 and the spatial oscillation period @xmath19 of the steady - state spin transport as well as @xmath4 of the transient spin transport .",
    "we conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "the system we study is the electron gas confined in a @xmath21 gaas quantum well ( qw ) with width @xmath22 grown along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "we assume that the well width is narrow enough so that only the lowest subband is occupied . with the help of the nonequilibrium green function method,@xcite",
    "one can write down the kinetic spin bloch equations@xcite by using gradient expansion and generalized kandanoff - baym ansatz :    @xmath24\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\left.{\\partial \\rho_{{\\bf k}}(x , t)\\over    \\partial t}\\right|_{\\mathtt{s}}. \\label{eq : kinetic } % \\end{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we assume that the transport direction is along the @xmath25-axis .",
    "@xmath26 is the density matrix whose diagonal elements @xmath27 represent the electron distribution functions with spin @xmath28(@xmath29 ) and momentum @xmath30 at position @xmath25 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements stand for the spin correlations between spin - up and -down electrons .",
    "the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinetic ] ) correspond to the drift driven by the electric field @xmath31 , determined by the poisson equation , and the diffusion of electrons , respectively .",
    "the fourth term describes the spin precession around the total magnetic field which is composed of the external magnetic field @xmath32 , the effective magnetic field @xmath11 due to the soc as well as the one from the hartree - fock term of the electron - electron coulomb interaction @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath11 contains the dresselhaus and the rashba terms:@xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the angle between @xmath25-axis ( the spin injection / diffusion direction ) and the @xmath36 crystal axis.@xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the dresselhaus coefficient.@xcite @xmath39 represents the rashba parameter which depends on the electric field along the growth direction of the qw .",
    "the scattering term @xmath40 includes all the scattering , i.e. , the electron - impurity , the electron - phonon and most importantly the electron - electron coulomb scattering .",
    "it is noted that in our calculation the electron - electron interaction is treated beyond the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the expressions for the hartree - fock and the scattering terms are given in detail in ref .  .",
    "the kinetic spin bloch equations describe the spin dynamics in the presence of drift , diffusion and spin precession . by choosing some specified initial and boundary conditions , one can obtain the evolution of the spin signal in time and real space by solving these equations for different systems . in order to study the tsg ,",
    "the initial spin polarization of the electrons is chosen to be a sinusoidal wave along the @xmath25-direction @xmath41 but uniform along the @xmath42-axis , where @xmath43 is the spatial period .",
    "using periodical boundary condition , one only needs to study the dynamics in one period of the space regime .    unless one makes some simplifications , the kinetic spin bloch equations are too complicated to be solved analytically . in this paper , we first present an analytical solution in the diffusive regime using simplified equations .",
    "this solution can only provide an intuitive vision of the tsg dynamics .",
    "we then present the numerical solution of the full kinetic spin bloch equations .      by neglecting the hartree - fock term , the inelastic scattering such as the electron - phonon and the electron - electron coulomb scatterings and the coupling to the poisson equation ,",
    "one is able to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinetic ] ) in diffusive regime when the scattering is strong enough , by using a similar method for calculating the spin relaxation as in refs .",
    ",    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the fourier component of the spin density function .",
    "the second term represents the diffusion term with the diffusion constant @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 with @xmath48 being the momentum relaxation time due to the electron - impurity scattering .",
    "the third term is the spin rotation caused by the non - vanishing net effective magnetic field @xmath49 due to the dp effect and the diffusion .",
    "the last term is the spin relaxation caused by the dp effect and the spin conserving scattering . for a system not far away from the equilibrium , @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the fermi distribution function .",
    "it is noted that similar results at low temperature have been obtained by different approach recently.@xcite    in the presence of both the dresselhaus and the rashba terms , the spin relaxation rates are highly anisotropic . in the weak soc regime ,",
    "the in - plane spin relaxation rates are characterized by two decay rates @xmath52 , corresponding to the spin relaxation along the characterized directions ( @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath54 ) axises respectively . while the out - of - plane relaxation rate is the sum of these two rates @xmath55 .",
    "note that , for the quasi - two - dimension system , the presence of the cubic dresselhaus term modifies the coefficient of linear dresselhaus term @xmath56 to be @xmath57 .",
    "this relation together with eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) are briefly derived in the appendix  a. without the spin rotation term , the evolution of the tsg is characterized by the decay rate @xmath58 . however , the spin rotation mixes the in - plane and out - of - plane spin dynamics . as a result ,",
    "the evolution is usually described by three relaxation rates .",
    "there are two special cases where the evolution can be described by two relaxation rates .",
    "the first one is in the system where only one of the dresselhaus and rashba terms is important so that the two in - plane spin dynamics become identical .",
    "the other is the spin injection / diffusion along @xmath59 and @xmath60 axises where the net effective magnetic field @xmath61 is parallel to one of the characteristic directions of the in - plane spin dynamics .",
    "thus it can only mix the remaining in - plane spin with the out - of - plane spin dynamics .",
    "the tsg evolution of these cases has a double - exponential form , @xmath62 with relaxation rates @xmath63 in which @xmath64 here @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is the spin relaxation time of the in - plane spin which mixes ( does not mix ) with the out - plane spin due to the net effective magnetic field . for spin injection / diffusion along @xmath59 axis , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for spin injection / diffusion along @xmath60 axis , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in the long wave length limit ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 become quadratic functions of @xmath2 , roughly correspond to the out - of - plane and the in - plane relaxation rates respectively .",
    "in general both of these two decay rates [ eq .  ( [ eq : decay ] ) ]",
    "are no longer simple quadratic functions of @xmath2 .",
    "if one uses the quadratic fitting to yield the spin diffusion coefficient , one either gets larger ( for @xmath74 ) or smaller ( for @xmath75 ) values than the true spin diffusion coefficient . the accurate way to get the information of spin diffusion coefficient should be from the average of these two rates @xmath76 which differs from the current widely used formula by replacing the spin decay rate by the average of the out - of - plane and in - plane ones .      the spin diffusion coefficient obtained by the simplified kinetic spin bloch equations",
    "does not include the contribution of the spin coulomb drag since the electron - electron coulomb scattering is neglected .",
    "moreover , the simplified equations are derived with only the elastic scattering . in the equations all of the relaxation times @xmath77 that appear in the diffusion coefficient @xmath78 , net effective magnetic field",
    "@xmath61 as well as the spin relaxation matrix are the same .",
    "for the inelastic electron - phonon scattering , it is still possible to write down eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) with same relaxation time @xmath77 by the elastic scattering approximation .",
    "this approximation is valid only for the electron - acoustic phonon scattering at high temperature and is not valid for the electron - lo phonon scattering .",
    "when the coulomb scattering is important , it gives different contributions to these relaxation times .",
    "on the one hand , the relaxation time @xmath77 in the spin relaxation matrix is affected by the whole coulomb scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "since the coulomb scattering among the same spin specie does not change the motion of the center of mass , it does not directly affect the spin diffusion coefficient .",
    "therefore the relaxation time @xmath77 in the spin diffusion coefficient is only affected by part of the coulomb scattering . for @xmath77 in the net effective magnetic field",
    ", it is even more complicated to analyze the role of the coulomb scattering since it is the joint result of diffusion and spin precession . therefore the relaxation times @xmath77 in the three different terms should be different in the present of the coulomb scattering .",
    "it would be extremely difficult to get the analytical results when the coulomb scattering is taken into account . in order to study the drag effect",
    ", we numerically solve the full kinetic spin bloch equations eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinetic ] ) , with all the scattering explicitly included .",
    "the numerical scheme is laid out in detail in appendix  b. for simplicity , we first consider the spin diffusion along ( 100 ) axis in a symmetrical qw in which the rashba term vanishes . in our calculation , the soc strength , the electron and impurity densities , and the qw width are chosen to be @xmath79  ev@xmath80,@xcite @xmath81  @xmath82 , @xmath83  @xmath82 and @xmath84  nm respectively .",
    "the material parameters are listed in detail in refs ..    our numerical results show that the temporal evolution of tsg can not be fitted by a simple exponential function with desirable accuracy . however ,",
    "if we use double - exponential function , the accuracy can be improved more than one order of magnitude .",
    "this justifies that the temporal evolution of the tsg has indeed double - exponential form in high temperature regime . in fig .",
    "1 we present the relaxation times of tsg as a function of the grating wave - vector @xmath2 for temperatures @xmath85 and 295  k. it is seen that @xmath86 decreases monotonically as @xmath2 increases while @xmath87 has a peak at some small @xmath88 .",
    "the wave - vector of the peak red - shifts when the temperature increases . in the inset of fig .",
    "1 , we show the ratio @xmath89 as the function of temperature for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "one finds that the ratio decreases with temperature .",
    "our results are in contrast to the predictions of earlier theoretical works that the ratio of these two decay rates and the position of the peak depend only on the soc and material parameters , but do not vary with the temperature.@xcite recent experiment showed that the ratio of these two decay rates are indeed decreases with the increase of the temperature.@xcite it is understood that the temperature dependence of the peak position and ratio between two decay times originate from the cubic @xmath90-term in the dresselhaus effective magnetic field . in earlier works",
    ", it was assumed that only the linear term is important .",
    "however , in wide quantum wells with high electron density , the cubic term becomes important .",
    "once the cubic term is considered , the peak @xmath88 moves from @xmath91 ( which is independent of temperature ) to about @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 increases with temperature , thus @xmath88 decreases .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath94 also originates from the contribution of the cubic dresselhaus term .    due to the natural of the numerical calculation ,",
    "it is not possible to show the results with all possible parameter combinations .",
    "however our qualitative conclusions are valid not just for this particular parameter set but for a large range of parameters . in order to check the quantitative accuracy of our numerical calculation",
    "we further show the spin relaxation times as functions of temperature together with the experimental data from ref .   in fig .",
    "2.curves in fig .",
    "2(a ) are the theoretical spin relaxation times of high mobility ( @xmath95  @xmath96/vs ) sample with @xmath97  @xmath98 , while the dots are the experimental data from ref .  .",
    "figure  2(b ) shows the result of low mobility sample ( @xmath99  @xmath96/vs ) with @xmath100  @xmath98 . in the calculation we use the finite square well assumption.@xcite all the parameters we use",
    "are chosen to be the experimental value if available , _ eg .",
    "_ the grating wave - vector , the electron density , the quantum well width , and the impurity concentration determined from the mobility .",
    "the only adjustable parameters are the spin - orbit coupling coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the calculation , @xmath38 is chosen to be @xmath101  ev@xmath80 and @xmath102  ev@xmath80 for the high and low mobility samples respectively and @xmath39 is set to be @xmath103 , close to the choice in ref .  .",
    "one can see from the figure that our theoretical results are in fairly good agreement with the experiment data .    in fig .",
    "3,we plot the decay rates @xmath104 and their average @xmath105 and difference @xmath106 as functions of @xmath2 at @xmath107  k. the decay rates @xmath108 fit poorly with a quadratic function of @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the average decay rate @xmath109 fits pretty well by the function @xmath110 .",
    "the resident error of the quadratic fitting for @xmath109 is two orders of magnitude smaller than those of @xmath108 .",
    "moreover we find that @xmath111 is very close to @xmath112 , inverse of the average of the in - plane and out - of - plane spin relaxation rate .",
    "for example , at @xmath107  k , @xmath111 is about @xmath113  ps compares to @xmath114  ps with @xmath7 calculated by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations for spacial uniform system with the same parameters.@xcite inspired by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , the coefficient of the quadratic term @xmath4 can be reasonably assumed to be the spin diffusion coefficient . in this way",
    "one can calculate the spin diffusion coefficient with the effect of coulomb drag included .",
    "the difference of @xmath115 and @xmath116 fits well as a linear function of @xmath2 .",
    "the linear coefficient of @xmath117 is about @xmath118 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay ] ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we present the spin diffusion coefficient calculated in the above mentioned method as a function of temperature . for comparison",
    ", we also include the charge diffusion coefficient , which is calculated by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations with the initial condition being the charge gradient instead of the spin gradient .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figure that @xmath119 . for spin - unpolarized charge diffusion ,",
    "the electrons move along the same direction and the coulomb scattering does not change the center - of - mass motion , therefore it does not change the charge diffusion coefficient directly . however , in the spin - polarized transport , spin - up and -down electrons move against each other and the coulomb scattering therefore slows down the relative motion of these two spin species and reduces spin diffusion coefficient .",
    "this is the so - called spin coulomb drag effect.@xcite from the figure one can tell that , in the temperature regime we study , as the temperature increases , both spin and charge diffusion coefficients decrease and their difference also decreases .",
    "therefore the coulomb drag is stronger in the low temperature regime .",
    "however , even at room temperature the coulomb drag is still strong enough to reduce the diffusion coefficient by 30  % .",
    "these results quantitatively agree with those of refs .  .",
    "it is also pointed out that the reduction of spin diffusion coefficient mostly comes from the coulomb drag .",
    "the soc only has slightly effect on the diffusion coefficient since the soc is very small compared to the fermi energy .",
    "the numerical result shows that removing the soc only changes spin diffusion coefficient up to one tenth percent for the system we studied .",
    "in this section we discuss how to obtain the steady - state spin injection information from the tsg signal , i.e. , to find out the relation between the steady - state spin injection length @xmath8 and spatial spin oscillation `` period '' @xmath19 and the spin diffusion constant @xmath4 together with the spin relaxation time @xmath7 .",

    "it is further noted from eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_s ] ) that _ the spin injection length @xmath8 is generally larger than @xmath127_. the only exception is when the spin injection is along @xmath59-direction for the qw with equal linear dresselhaus and rashba spin - orbit couplings . in this case",
    "@xmath128 , therefore the net effective magnetic field [ eq .  ( [ eq : hq ] ) ] vanishes .",
    "consequently the in - plane and out - of - plane spin modes do not mix .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for most of the cases , @xmath8 is in the same order of @xmath127 , although the former is usually larger .",
    "however , there are some special cases where @xmath129 , @xmath8 can be _ orders of magnitude _ different from @xmath127 . specifically , according to cheng _",
    "et al._,@xcite when the spin injection / transport direction is along @xmath60 in ( 001 ) qw , @xmath8 becomes larger and larger as @xmath39 approaches @xmath56 , _",
    "regardless _ of the direction of spin polarization . at the limit of @xmath130 ,",
    "the spin injection length trends to infinity when the cubic dresselhaus term is ignored and the spin oscillates with a spatial period of @xmath131.@xcite as @xmath7 is finite and @xmath4 changes little for different grating directions , there is no way to obtain infinite @xmath8 from @xmath127 .",
    "the infinite injection length and the finite oscillation period can also be understood from the tsg point of view . without the cubic dresselhaus term , @xmath132 approaches zero and @xmath133 when @xmath134 .",
    "consequently @xmath135 when @xmath130 .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that @xmath136 becomes infinite provided @xmath137 .",
    "therefore the steady - state spin injection along @xmath60 axis is dominated by this non - decay tsg mode which is responsible for the infinite spin injection length and the spatial oscillation period @xmath138 .",
    "when the electron - phonon and the electron - electron coulomb scatterings are taken into account , @xmath139 should be revised accordingly . unfortunately , there are no analytical expressions for @xmath7 , @xmath65 and @xmath140 when all the scatterings are included .",

    "moreover , for all the cases we study , @xmath19 and @xmath8 obtained from these two methods agree with each other very well . although we should point out that the accuracy of @xmath19 is higher than @xmath8 due to the numerical error analysis .",
    "since @xmath150 is close to 0 , its numerical error is much larger than @xmath142 .",

    "in conclusion , we study the evolution of tsg by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations with periodic boundary condition . from the simplified equations ,",
    "we analytically show that due to the spin precession the spin signal decays double - exponentially instead of simple exponentially , even in the diffusive regime . _ neither _ of these two decay rates are simple quadratic functions of the grating wave - vector @xmath2 .",

    "therefore it is more accurate to yield the diffusion coefficient from @xmath2 dependence of the average of the two decay rates .",
    "we further show that the corresponding solution from the full kinetic spin bloch equations which include all of the scattering mechanisms , especially the coulomb scattering , is also in the form of the double exponential decay . from the @xmath2-dependence of the average decay rate",
    ", one can calculate the spin diffusion coefficient with the coulomb drag effect included .",
    "it is shown that the coulomb drag effect is stronger in low temperature and decreases with the increase of temperature . however , even at room temperature the coulomb drag is still an important factor which reduces the spin diffusion coefficient markedly compared to the charge diffusion coefficient .    we also show that by using the tsg result one can obtain the characteristic steady - state transport parameters , such as the injection length and the spatial oscillation length , from diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and the spin relaxation times .",
    "we point out that in a system with the soc , the wildly adopted relation @xmath9 in the literature is generally quantitatively inaccurate and can be even qualitatively wrong for some special cases . the accurate way to extract the spin injection and spatial oscillation lengths directly from the tsg decay rates at different grating wave - vector , which are experimentally measurable , is proposed .",
