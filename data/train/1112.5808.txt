    "for such systems , previous workers proposed different control laws : the time - varying feedback laws @xcite , the discontinuous feedback laws @xcite , variable constraint control laws @xcite , and time - state control laws @xcite . for the deterministic systems , on the other hand , the authors of this paper propose the stochastic feedback laws via the stochastic control lyapunov functions @xcite .",
