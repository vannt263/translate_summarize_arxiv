    "at least two magnetars have associated supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the second class of radio - quiet inss includes colder ( apparently older ) nearby objects , showing soft thermal spectra with temperatures in a 50150 ev range and luminosities @xmath7@xmath8 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "at least some of these objects , sometimes dubbed _ dim isolated neutron stars _ , are likely ordinary rotation - powered pulsars whose radio beams are not observable from earth .",
    "third is a class of point - like x - ray sources found near the centers of snrs that can not be identified as active radio pulsars or magnetars",
    ". these _ central compact objects _ ( ccos ) , presumably inss , have thermal spectra with bb temperatures 0.20.5 kev and x - ray luminosities @xmath9@xmath4 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "we define a cco as an x - ray point source which ( 1 ) is found near the center of a snr , ( 2 ) shows no radio/@xmath10-ray counterpart , ( 3 ) shows no pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , ( 4 ) has a soft thermal - like spectrum .",

    "the size of the emitting region varied from 0.2 to 1.6 km .",

    "the faintness of these objects ( e.g. , h=2223 ) shows that the putative secondary companion is a dwarf of a very late spectral type ( later than m4 ) .",

    "_ rosat _ pspc observations of g347.30.5 ( pfeffermann & aschenbach 1996 ) showed a central point source , for which neither optical / radio counterpart nor x - ray pulsations have been detected ( slane et al .",

    "the combined  and _ xmm _ spectra of the cco can be reasonably fit with either a single bb ( @xmath73 kev , @xmath74 km ) or a steep pl ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the best fit to the cco spectrum is given by a bb+pl model , with @xmath76 kev and @xmath77 , similar to other ccos where the two - component model fits are constrained .",
    "the above - described spectral observations of ccos make it possible to examine the age dependence of the spectral parameters .",
    "figure 1 shows such dependences for the bb temperature and radius . since the observed",
    "cco spectra are similar to those of magnetars in quiescence , we added the data on a few axps and sgrs ( from mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we see from figure 1 that ccos , being on average younger than magnetars , have somewhat lower temperatures and smaller sizes , albeit with significant overlaps .",
    "interestingly , the overlap in the temperature - age diagram disappears if the kes 79 cco is attributed to the magnetar group . in this case",
    "the five ccos lie along a `` cooling branch '' , while the magnetars show no temperature - age correlation . if we consider ccos and magnetars as a single group , no significant temperature - age correlation is seen . on the other hand , the effective radii of ccos and magnetars do show positive correlation with age ( a hot spot spreads over the ns surface ?",
    "a hole in a ` screen ' gets bigger ? ) , with magnetars being on average older than ccos . in the luminosity - temperature diagram ( an analog of hertzsprung - russell diagram ",
    "2 ) the cco and magnetar populations almost do not overlap ( magnetars are hotter and more luminous ) , lying on the same ` sequence ' .    thus , at least some ccos appear to be relatives of axps and sgrs , but their relationship is not fully understood . on average , ccos are younger , perhaps colder , and their emitting areas are smaller than those of axps and sgrs .",
    "does it mean that ccos are actually young magnetars , not mature enough to develop characteristic properties of axps / sgrs ( e.g. , they have not spun down to the 512 s period range , or their crusts are still too durable to crack and cause bursts ) ?",
    "this hypothesis could , at least , explain the lack of pulsar activity in ccos , but it seems to be at odds with the properties of 1e  1207.45259 , the best - studied cco ( unless it is a different kind of object ) .",
    "to conclude , we now have strong reasons to believe that ccos are not black holes , and their radiation is not powered by accretion .",
    "very likely , they are isolated `` neutron stars '' ( perhaps composed of more exotic particles , e.g. , quarks ) , but at least most of them are not ordinary rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "apparently , their thermal - like x - ray emission emerges from a part of ns surface .",
    "we can speculate that the internal heat of the ns is somehow channeled into these small areas ( e.g. , by superstrong localized magnetic fields ) or most of the surface is covered by a thermo - isolating `` blanket '' or a `` screen '' opaque for soft x - rays .",
    "alternatively , the hot spots could be heated by some local sources ( dissipation of superstrong magnetic fields ? nuclear reactions ? ) .",
    "future x - ray timing and spectral observations , together with deep nir imaging , are needed to understand the true nature of ccos .",
