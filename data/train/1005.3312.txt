    "the interplay between spin density wave ( sdw ) ordering and superconductivity clearly plays a central role in the physics of a variety of quasi two - dimensional correlated electron materials .",
    "this is evident from recent studies of the phase diagram of the ferro - pnictides @xcite and the ` 115 ' family of heavy - fermion compounds @xcite . in the cuprates",
    ", it has been argued that @xmath4-wave superconductivity is induced by sdw fluctuations in a metal @xcite , and this has been the starting point for numerous studies of the complex phase diagram @xcite . in all these materials",
    ", there is a regime of co - existence between sdw ordering and superconductivity , and this opens the way to a study of the ` competition ' between these orders @xcite : this competition can be tuned by an applied magnetic field , as has been studied in a number of revealing experiments @xcite on the lsco and ybco series of superconductors .",
    "this paper will discuss a question that arises naturally in the study of such competing orders @xcite .",
    "we consider , first , the ` parent ' quantum critical point as that associated with the onset of sdw order , @xmath5 , in a metal . to access this point",
    "we have to suppress superconductivity in some manner , say by the application of a magnetic field .",
    "this parent critical point will occur at a value @xmath6 of some tuning parameter @xmath7 , which could be the carrier concentration or the applied pressure .",
    "we define @xmath7 so that @xmath8 is the sdw phase with @xmath9 ; see fig .",
    "[ totalshift ] .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is clearly material specific , and will depend upon numerous microscopic details .",
    "then , we turn our attention to the onset of sdw order within the superconductor ( sc ) ; we characterize the latter by a gap amplitude @xmath1 , and denote the critical value of @xmath7 by @xmath10 .",
    "the essence of the picture of competing orders is that the onset of superconductivity should shrink the region of sdw order , and hence @xmath11 .",
    "we will be interested here in particular in the magnitude of the shift @xmath12 .",
    "we will see that the shift is dominated by low energy physics , and so has a universal character .",
    "this shift @xmath12 played a central role in the phase diagrams presented in refs .  , and applied to the cuprates .",
    "recent work has shown that similar phase diagrams also apply to the pnictides @xcite and the 115 compounds @xcite . in the pnictides , a `` backbending '' of the onset of sdw order upon entering the sc phase , consistent with the idea of @xmath13 .",

    "the critical points in the metal are at @xmath14 , and under superconductivity , these shift to @xmath15 , towards the ordered phases .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=3 ]    let us begin by computing the shift @xmath12 in mean - field landau theory .",
    "the simplest free energy of the sdw and sc order parameters has the form @xcite : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the phenomenological parameter which controls the competition between the order parameters . examining the onset of a phase with @xmath18 in the superconductor with @xmath19",
    ", we conclude immediately from eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) that @xmath20 such a shift was a key feature of the theory in ref .  .",
    "the primary focus of the previous work was in the lower field region , where the superconductivity is well - formed , and @xmath1 is large .",
    "here it is appropriate to treat the superconductivity in a mean - field manner , and ignore pairing fluctuations , while treating spin fluctuations more carefully .",
    "the present paper turns the focus to higher fields , where eventually superconductivity is lost . here ,",
    "clearly , landau theory can not be expected to apply to the superconducting order .",
    "moreover , we expect the fermi surface of the electrons to be revealed , and a more careful treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom is called for .",
    "one of the primary results of our paper will be that the landau theory result in eq .",
    "( [ landaushift ] ) breaks down for small @xmath1 , and in particular in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "this is a consequence of the crucial importance of fermi surface physics in determining the position of the sdw transition at @xmath22 .",
    "instead , we will show from the physics of the `` hot spots '' on the fermi surface that the shift is larger , with @xmath23 for the competing order picture to hold , we require that @xmath24 . somewhat surprisingly , we will find that our results for @xmath25 are not transparently positive definite .",
    "different regions of the fermi surface contribute opposing signs , so that determining the final sign of @xmath25 becomes a delicate computation .",
    "in particular @xmath25 will depend upon the vicinity of ` hot spots ' on the fermi surface , which are special points connected by the sdw ordering wavevector .",
    "we will find that the immediate vicinity of the hot spots contributes a positive sign to @xmath25 , while farther regions contribute a negative sign .",
    "thus the primary competition between sdw and superconductivity happens at the hot spots , while other regions of the fermi surface which survive the onset of sdw order continue to yield an attraction between sdw and superconductivity .",
    "for the case where the two hotspots connected by the sdw ordering wavevector are equivalent under a lattice symmetry operation ( _ i.e. _ they have the same pairing gap and the same magnitude of the fermi velocity ) , we will find that distinct contributions to @xmath25 exactly compensate each other , so that @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the case that the two spots are not crystallographically equivalent ( which is the generic situation in both the cuprates and the pnictides ) , we will show that @xmath24 .",
    "a positive @xmath25 is indicated in fig .",
    "[ totalshift ] .",
    "we had considered the shift in sdw ordering due to superconductivity in a previous work @xcite . however , in that work , the metallic and superconducting states were not fermi liquids and bcs states respectively , but rather fractionalized states known as ` algebraic charge liquids ' @xcite . in this case , we found that the competition between sdw and superconductivity was robust , and always yielded a shrinking in the size of the sdw region .",
    "we will not consider such exotic states here , but work entirely within the framework of fermi liquid theory , in which the onset of superconductivity leads to a traditional bcs superconductor .",
    "in this context the interplay between sdw and sc in a fermi liquid is conveniently encapsulated in the ` spin - fermion ' model @xcite .",
    "we will find the same qualitative shift in the sdw critical point as found earlier @xcite , and the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ sdwshift ] )",
    ".    we will also generalize our methods to analyze the shifts in the quantum critical points of other orderings between the metallic and superconducting phases .",
    "specifically , we will consider charge density wave ( cdw ) order and ising - nematic order , @xmath27 .",
    "we will find that the cdw shift initially appears to be formally similar to eq .",
    "( [ sdwshift ] ) , but the coefficient @xmath25 is found to be exactly zero ; terms higher order in @xmath1 do indicate competition with superconductivity , but the cdw critical point shift is much smaller than the sdw s for ising - nematic order , @xmath27 , we will also find that the fermi surface result is similar to that in landau theory , as in eq .",
    "( [ landaushift ] ) .",
    "this smaller shift is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ totalshift ] .",
    "the weaker effect upon @xmath27 is due to its reduced sensitivity to the gap opened by superconductivity on the fermi surface .",
    "we will present a detailed discussion of the implication of these results for the pnictide and cuprate phase diagrams to section  [ conclusion ] . however , let us highlight here an important inference that will follow from our computations .",
    "we will argue that the experimental phase diagrams imply that ising - nematic ordering and sdw ordering are independent instabilities of the fermi surface for the cuprates .",
    "in contrast , for the pnictides , our conclusion will be that the sdw ordering is the primary fermi surface instability , and the ising - nematic ordering is a secondary response to the square of the sdw order parameter .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we will begin in section  [ spin - fermion ] by introducing our starting point , the spin - fermion model with the sdw fluctuation . within the spin - fermion theory ,",
    "we show that the sdw fluctuation induces the @xmath4 wave pairing for the cuprate and @xmath28 for the pnictides instead usual @xmath29 wave pairings in section [ instabilities ] . assuming the @xmath4 or @xmath28 wave pairings in each case , we extend the spin - fermion theory into the theory with pairing and other possible orders in section  [ theory ] . in section [ qcpshift ]",
    ", we show the quantum critical point shifts toward the ordered phase , which explicitly shows the competition between superconductivity and the sdw phase .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] presents our conclusions .",
    "we will study the system with sdw quantum phase transition in two dimensional system .",
    "the main ingredients of the spin - fermion model are fermi surfaces and the sdw order parameter .",
    "let us first consider generic microscopic hamiltonians for the cuprates and the pnictides .",
    "@xmath30 here , we consider `` minimal fermi surfaces '' for both materials , where @xmath31 correspond to the one band electron for the cuprates around the @xmath32 point , and for the pnictides , @xmath33 correspond to the hole and electron bands centered at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . all terms containing the sdw operators are in @xmath36 . in fig .",

    "within the spin - fermion model , we can address pairing problems naturally .",
    "if we consider the sdw fluctuation as a pairing boson , then we need to investigate plausibility of the pairing instabilities by the sdw .",
    "the basic idea is following .",
    "if we assume there is infinitesimal pairing , then the pairing becomes enhanced or suppressed by the integrating out higher energy - momentum contributions depending on the possibility of the pairing channel . in the fig .",
    "[ vertex ] such a pairing vertex is illustrated .",
    "note that the fermions with opposite momentums are paired , so the participating fermions in the pairing is not the same as ones in the sdw in general .",

    "as we can see , the vertex becomes irrelevant in the low energy limit in the rg sense .",
    "therefore , the sdw fluctuation can not mediate usual @xmath29 wave pairing for the cuprates and @xmath54 for the pnictides .    however , in the @xmath4 wave channel of the cuprates @xcite and the @xmath28 channel @xcite of the pnictides , the relative sign between the hotspots changes , given the pairing symmetries .",
    "such relative sign changes allow the pairing channel s enhancement .",
    "the pairing and its vertex correction are @xmath56 clearly , the alternative sign change induces enhancement of the @xmath4 , @xmath28 wave pairings in the low energy limit .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 and @xmath28 pairing is natural under the sdw fluctuations rather than usual @xmath29 and @xmath54 pairings in conventional theory . in the next sections",
    ", we assume the existence of the pairings in each case and incorporate them into the spin - fermion model in a manner consistent with symmetry .",
    "moreover , by symmetry consideration , we also introduce other possible order parameters such as a nematic order and charge density wave and extend our theory to incorporate them .",
    "notice that the vertex correction in the eq .",
    "( [ pairing ] ) is logarithmically divergent if we have finite correlation length .",
    "such behavior is a well - known signature of the conventional bcs theory .",
