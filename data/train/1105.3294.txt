    "low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) , if it exists , affects various low - energy phenomenology .",
    "the most prominent place to look for the effects of susy particles is the lhc experiment because it can provide a direct confirmation of the existence of susy particles . however , precision experiments , in particular , those related to flavor and/or cp violation , also put severe constraints on supersymmetric models .",
    "the masses of superparticles are required to be larger than @xmath0 to avoid flavor and cp constraints if there is no mechanism to suppress off - diagonal elements of the sfermion mass matrices and cp violating phases @xcite .",
    "such a large value of the superparticle masses are unacceptable from the naturalness point of view .",
    "one of the attractive mechanisms to avoid the susy flavor problem is the gauge mediation @xcite.for early attempts , see also @xcite . in the gauge mediation model , sfermion masses",
    "are generated via the interaction with gauge multiplet , so the degeneracy of the masses of sfermions which have same gauge quantum numbers is guaranteed .",
    "in such a framework , however , it is still non - trivial to avoid the susy cp problem .",
    "this is because , even in the gauge mediation model , new cp violating phases arise in operators which are flavor blind",
    ". in particular , relative phases among the gaugino masses , susy invariant higgs mass parameter , and the soft susy breaking bi - linear higgs mass ( i.e. , so - called @xmath1 parameter ) do not vanish in general , which often results in too large electric dipole moments ( edms ) of electron , neutron , and so on @xcite . as in other cases ,",
    "the susy cp problem is serious in the gauge mediation susy breaking scenario .",
    "so far , a possibility to solve the susy cp problem in the gauge mediation model is thought to consider a model in which the @xmath1 parameter vanishes at the messenger scale @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we reconsider the susy cp problem .",
    "we will concentrate on the effects of cp violating phases which have not been seriously considered before ; we study two important effects which are from ( i ) the breaking of the grand - unified - theory ( gut ) relation among the gaugino masses due to the gut symmetry breaking field , and ( ii ) the supergravity contribution to the @xmath1 parameter . as we see in the following , these possibly become sources of too large edms to be consistent with the current constraints .",
    "thus , even if one adopts a model with vanishing @xmath1 parameter at the messenger scale @xmath2 , which has been regarded as a solution to the susy cp problem , too large edms may be still induced .",
    "first , let us give an overview of the cp violating phases which are relevant to our study",
    ". in the present study , the most important cp violating phases are relative phases among the gaugino masses @xmath3 , the susy invariant higgs mass @xmath4 , and the soft - susy breaking higgs mass parameter @xmath1 .",
    "( in the following , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 correspond to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively . )    to see this , we denote the relevant part of the soft susy breaking terms as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gaugino field , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are up- and down - type higgs boson , respectively . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the following phases are invariant under the phase rotation of the mssm fields and hence are physical : the effects of the phases in the tri - linear coupling constants ( i.e. , the so - called @xmath15 parameters ) on edms do not have @xmath16 enhancement and are at most of the same order of those of @xmath17 . in our numerical calculation , effects of the phases of @xmath15 parameters are properly taken into account .",
    "@xmath18 if these phases are non - vanishing , they become the sources of edms ( and other cp violating quantities ) .",
    "thus , those phases are stringently constrained although , in many models , they are expected to be of @xmath19 . in order to solve the susy cp problem , it is inevitable to make all the phases of the gaugino masses equal ; otherwise , it is impossible to realize @xmath20 . in the simplest model of gmsb , this is the case because the gaugino masses obey the gut relation .",
    "one possibility of solving the susy cp problem is to adopt a model in which the @xmath1 parameter vanishes at the messenger scale @xcite . in the gauge mediation model ,",
    "the scalar tri - linear coupling constants at the messenger scale are expected to vanish ( at least at the one - loop level ) .",
    "thus , we can rotate away all the cp violating phases ( other than the ckm phase ) from the mssm lagrangian if all the phases in the gaugino masses are aligned . assuming that the low - energy effective theory below the messenger scale is the mssm",
    ", the @xmath1 parameter obeys the following renormalization group equation @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , are @xmath25 yukawa matrices for up - type quarks , down - type quarks , and leptons , respectively , while @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , are corresponding tri - linear scalar coupling matrices .",
    "in addition , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are gauge coupling constants for @xmath9 , and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "then , even if @xmath31 , @xmath1 at the electroweak scale is generated from the renormalization - group effect , which gives a viable higgs potential consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "another possibility is an accidental cancellation among the phases . even though such a cancellation requires a tuning of underlying parameters ,",
    "all the phases can be simultaneously made small if the relation @xmath32 is realized .",
    "this is the case if the gut relation among the gaugino masses holds .    in the following ,",
    "we do not specify the mechanism to generate the @xmath4 and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "our purpose is to study the effect of the gut symmetry breaking and the supergravity effect which have not been studied in detail .",
    "so we assume that @xmath17 vanish in the limit that the above mentioned effects are neglected .",
    "first , we consider the cp violation from the breaking of the gut symmetry . in simple models of gauge mediation which neglects the effects of gut symmetry breaking",
    ", it is guaranteed that @xmath32 .",
    "we start our discussion with a general case ; we parameterize the superpotential of the messenger sector as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote vector - like chiral multiplets which are in irreducible representations of the standard - model gauge group @xmath36 .",
    "( the gauge indices are implicit . ) here , @xmath37 is a coupling constant while @xmath38 a mass parameter . in some of gauge mediation models , in particular ,",
    "those adopting the iss mechanism of susy breaking @xcite , @xmath38 is non - vanishing @xcite , although there exist models with @xmath39 .",
    "( for models with @xmath40 , see also @xcite . ) as we will see , the existence of the mass parameter significantly affects the aspect of cp violation in the susy breaking parameters . in general",
    ", there may exist several multiplets in the same representation of @xmath41 ; those multiplets are distinguished by the indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 which run @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the number of @xmath34 and @xmath35 pair .",
    "then , the summation in eq .   is over all the irreducible representation of the @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , @xmath46 is the singlet superfield whose @xmath47-component is non - vanishing ; if there exists several singlet fields , we take their linear combination such that only @xmath46 acquires @xmath47-component vev .",
    "it should be understood that @xmath48 contains susy invariant mass of @xmath34 and @xmath35 arising from the vev of singlet fields other than @xmath46 .    at the leading order of @xmath49 ,",
    "the gaugino mass is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52-function coefficient of the gauge coupling constant @xmath53 due to the chiral multiplet @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , @xmath54 is the ratio between the susy breaking mass squared and the supersymmetric mass of the multiplet @xmath34 and is given by @xmath55^{-1}_{ji},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56^{-1}$ ] being the inverse matrix of @xmath57 .",
    "when there is no supersymmetric mass term ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) , we can easily see that the phases of all the gaugino masses are aligned ; indeed , in such a case , @xmath54 becomes @xmath59 and is independent of the parameters in superpotential .",
    "notice that this conclusion is independent of the assumption of gut .",
    "even if there exists supersymmetric mass term , the phases of gaugino masses become the same as long as the exact gut relations hold among @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath62 are in a same irreducible representation of gut group @xmath63 , the relations @xmath64 and @xmath65 are realized with neglecting @xmath66 breaking effects .",
    "the above relations , however , break down once we take account of the effect of @xmath63 breaking .",
    "it is obvious that the relation @xmath32 is not guaranteed if the gut relation @xmath64 or @xmath65 is somehow violated for @xmath34 and @xmath62 from the same multiplet of @xmath63 .",
    "violation may happen due to operators including the field responsible for the gut symmetry breaking @xmath67 .",
    "( we denote such a field @xmath68 . )",
    "we assume that all the higher - dimensional operators allowed by the @xmath63 exist with the cut - off scale of the order of the planck scale @xmath69 .",
    "then , their effects are expected to be proportional to powers of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the vev @xmath72 is expected to be of the order of the gut scale @xmath73 .",
    "importantly , the higher - dimensional operators not only induce the breaking of the gut relations but also provide a new source of cp violation because the coefficients of the higher - dimensional operators are complex in general . even though the effect of the higher - dimensional operator is expected to be suppressed by powers of @xmath74",
    ", it can be large enough to be constrained by present and future experiments .",
    "in particular , sizable edms can be generated , as we see below .",
    "the size of the breaking of the gut relation is determined by the structure of the superpotential , which depends on the properties of the @xmath63 breaking field @xmath68 and the vector - like messenger multiplet . in order to make our discussion concrete and quantitative",
    ", we consider the simplest gauge mediation model based on @xmath75 susy gut ; the messenger multiplet is assumed to consist of @xmath76 and @xmath77 representations of @xmath78 , which we denote @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath81 .",
    "thus , if the gut symmetry is broken by a field in @xmath82 representation , the effect of gut breaking can be of the order of @xmath83 ; otherwise , the effect is more suppressed . below the gut scale , the vector - like multiplets split into @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( which are from @xmath79 ) , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( which are from @xmath80 ) , whose transformation properties under the standard - model gauge group are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the first case is that @xmath63 is broken by a field which transforms as @xmath82 of @xmath78 , as in the minimal susy gut @xcite .",
    "we denote the gut breaking field as @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 and @xmath52 are @xmath78 indices , which run @xmath94 ) , whose vacuum - expectation value is parameterized as @xmath95 then the mass of @xmath96- and @xmath97-bosons is given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the gauge coupling constant at the gut scale .",
    "in this case , the effects of the breaking of the gut relation is proportional to @xmath100:gut symmetry breaking effect can be also on the mass terms , which may induce the edms .",
    "the sizes of the edms are of the same order of those with the gut symmetry breaking effect on the tri - linear term in the superpotential as far as the correction to the mass term is of the order of @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 where @xmath103 then , assuming @xmath104 , the gaugino masses are given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 here , we only consider the leading - order contribution from @xmath110 .    in this framework , we calculate the edms of the electron , the neutron and the mercury . as we will see below ,",
    "since the phase of @xmath1 is not aligned to those of gaugino masses , the physical phase @xmath17 become non - negligible , resulting in sizable edms . here , we take @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ; the phase is chosen to maximize the contribution to the edms . with this choice of the parameters ,",
    "the physical phase @xmath17 of the order of @xmath113 is induced , and this phase is large enough to be constrained from the present edm experiments .",
    "the electron edm gives a severe constraint on @xmath17 .",
    "the experimental bound on the electron edm is given by @xcite @xmath114 this bound should be compared to the susy contributions , which are dominated by chargino diagrams .",
    "the results are shown in panel ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : edm24 ] on @xmath115 vs.  @xmath16 plane ; here , the normalization parameter @xmath116 is varied to give the proper value of @xmath115 , while @xmath16 is calculated as a function of the @xmath1 parameter at the messenger scale @xmath117 . in panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", the messenger scales are taken to be @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the electron edm is more enhanced as @xmath16 becomes larger , which is due to the fact that the left - right mixing in the slepton sector is approximately proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "one important constraint on the mssm parameter space may be from the consideration of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of the muon .",
    "recent detailed analysis shows that the deviation between the experimental and theoretical values is at the @xmath120 level , which may be due to the physics beyond the standard model @xcite . assuming that the deviation is from the susy particles , the susy contribution to the muon mdm is @xcite @xmath121 in fig .",
    "[ fig : edm24 ] , we also show the region where the muon mdm becomes consistent with the above constraint .",
    "one can easily see that , in such a region , the electron edm becomes one order of magnitude larger than the experimental constraint if @xmath122 ( as far as the phase is of @xmath19 ) .",
    "hadronic edms also give stringent constraints on the size and the phase of @xmath123 . here",
    "we consider the neutron edm and the mercury edm , induced by the edms and chromoelectric dipole moments ( cedms ) of quarks .",
    "the experimental bound on the neutron edm is given by @xcite @xmath124 which should be compared with theoretical estimation @xcitethe contributions from the strange quark are also discussed in the literature @xcite , and this may be as important as contributions from the up and down quarks . with inclusion of the strange quark contribution , the constraint from the neutron edm can become as severe as the constraints from the mercury edm and the electron edm .",
    "@xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 being the edm and cedm of a quark , respectively . because the susy contributions to the down quark ( c)edm is enhanced by @xmath16 , and also because @xmath128 and @xmath129 have larger coefficient in eq.([eq : neutron_edm ] ) , susy contribution to @xmath130 is dominated by @xmath128 and @xmath131 in most of the cases .",
    "we have calculated @xmath130 , and the results are shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : edm24 ] with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 is marginally consistent for @xmath118 , while it is excluded for @xmath133 in the parameter region consistent with the muon mdm constraint .",
    "the constraint from the mercury edm is also stringent .",
    "the experimental bound is given by @xcite @xmath134 which can be translated to the upper bound on the cedms of quarks as @xcite @xmath135 the contours of @xmath136 are shown in panels ( e ) and ( f ) with @xmath137 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the constraint from the mercury edm is as stringent as the electron edm constraint .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : edm24 ] , the contours of @xmath31 are also shown , which correspond to vanishing @xmath17 in the absence of the gut relation breaking operator .",
    "one can see that , adopting the natural value of the @xmath123 parameter , the edms become too large to be consistent with the experimental constraints if we adopt .",
    "thus , if the breaking of the gut relation is due to an operator which is linear in @xmath63 breaking fields , the susy cp problem might remain even in models with vanishing @xmath1 parameter .",
    "= 0.8    next , we consider the case that @xmath78 is broken by a field in @xmath138 representation , as in the case of missing partner model @xcite;if the gut symmetry is broken by a field in a real ( but not adjoint ) representation of @xmath78 , the leading order contribution of the gut symmetry breaking is always @xmath139 as far as all the operators allowed by the @xmath78 symmetry are present . then , in those cases , the sizes of the edms are of the same order of the case with the gut symmetry breaking by a @xmath138 representation .",
    "we parameterize the vev as @xmath140 where , in the above expressions , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 run @xmath144 , while @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath143 run @xmath147 .",
    "( then , the @xmath96- and @xmath97-boson mass is @xmath148 . ) in this case , the effect of the @xmath78 breaking in the superpotential should be second ( or higher ) order in @xmath149 ; we consider the following superpotential : @xmath150 where @xmath151 in this case , the gaugino masses are given by @xmath152 with @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : edm75 ] , we show the edms with @xmath156 .",
    "we take @xmath157 , which maximizes the edms . in panels ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) , the messenger scale is taken to be @xmath158 , while @xmath159 in ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "the electron edm is shown in the panels ( a ) and ( b ) , while neutron edm are shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in addition , the results of @xmath136 are shown in panel , ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "as one can expect , the edm constraints are less severe compared to the case with @xmath82 representation .",
    "this indicates that the edm constraints can be avoided if operators linear in the @xmath63 breaking field are somehow forbidden .",
    "however , such models are testable if the experimental sensitivities on the edms are improved by two orders of magnitude .",
    "= 0.8    before closing this section , we comment on another effect , i.e. , renormalization group effect , which modifies the gut relation among the coupling constants .",
    "the renormalization group equations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 ( with @xmath162 being the wave - function renormalization factor ) is the anomalous dimension of the chiral superfield @xmath96 .",
    "then , the solutions of the above equations are given by @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath166 .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath167 .",
    "then , for multiplets @xmath34 and @xmath62 originating from the same multiplet of @xmath63 , the equality @xmath168 is realized if @xmath64 and @xmath65 at the gut scale .",
    "using the fact that @xmath169 become independent of the standard - model gauge group ( i.e. , @xmath170 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 ) as far as all the fields in the same multiplet of @xmath63 are contained in the summation , @xmath171 becomes universal and hence there is no relative phase among gaugino masses .",
    "next , we consider the phases from the supergravity effect .",
    "when the standard model is supersymmetrized , naturally we consider local supersymmetry , i.e. , supergravity .",
    "then , supergravity effect may also induce small but non - negligible cp violating phases .    concerning the phases @xmath17 , one should consider the effect on the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "@xmath15 parameters are also generated by the supergravity effect , and are also of the order of the gravitino mass .",
    "the effect of the phases in the @xmath15 parameters are at most of the same order of the that in @xmath1 because the contribution of the @xmath15 parameter does not have the @xmath16 enhancement .",
    "naturally , such an effect is estimated to be of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath172 .",
    "importantly , in general , the supergravity contribution to @xmath1 is complex , and its phase is not aligned to those of gaugino masses .",
    "thus , this becomes a new source of cp violation .    to study its consequence ,",
    "we calculate the edms taking account of the supergravity effects on the phase in @xmath1 parameter . here , we parameterize @xmath1 as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the supergravity contribution to the @xmath1 parameter , which is expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass . because we are interested in the gauge mediation model ,",
    "the gravitino mass is much smaller than the electroweak scale , and hence @xmath175 . as mentioned before",
    ", we do not specify the source of the dominant contribution @xmath176 ; we assume that @xmath177 as @xmath178 to derive a conservative constraint .",
    "in addition , we adopt the usual gut relation among the gaugino masses ; the @xmath123 and @xmath179 parameters used in the previous section are set to be zero .",
    "we calculate edms taking @xmath180 and @xmath181 . with this choice ,",
    "the phase @xmath17 is of the order of @xmath182 .",
    "the contours of constant edms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sugra ] .",

    "notice that the supergravity contributions to the off - diagonal elements of the sfermion mass matrices are typically @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the cp violations may put severer upper bound on the gravitino mass than the flavor violations .",
    "= 0.8    in the present framework , the edms are proportional to @xmath185 as far as @xmath186 is much smaller than @xmath187 .",
    "because @xmath186 is expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath172 , we can see that gauge mediation models with @xmath188 require some mechanism to suppress the phase in @xmath174 parameter ( and hence that in the gravitino mass ) relative to the gaugino masses if we take the anomaly in the muon mdm seriously .",
    "in this letter , we have studied the susy cp problem in gauge mediation model .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the effects of gut symmetry breaking and the supergravity effect .",
    "both of these effects possibly induce too large cp violating phase in the mssm parameters to be consistent with the experimental constraints on edms .",
    "it was considered that the susy cp problem can be avoided in the gauge mediation model in which @xmath1 parameter is not generated at the messenger scale .",
    "however , the cp violating phases discussed in this letter can not be eliminated even in such a model .",
    "in particular , the effect of the gut symmetry breaking spoils the gut relation among the gaugino masses if a mass term is introduced to the vector - like messenger multiplets ; consequently , the phases of the gaugino masses may become different . in the case that operators which are linear in @xmath63 breaking field are allowed , the edms are likely to be too large in the parameter region where the susy contribution to the muon mdm explains the discrepancy between the experimental and standard - model values . in other cases ,",
