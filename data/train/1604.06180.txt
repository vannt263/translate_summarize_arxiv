    "an excess of events containing two photons with invariant mass near 750 gev has been observed in 13 tev proton ",
    "proton collisions by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the cross section @xmath5 is estimated to be @xmath6 and there is no evidence of any accompanying excess in the dilepton channel  @xcite .",
    "if we interpret this excess as the two photon decay of a single new particle of mass @xmath7 then atlas data provide a hint of a large width : @xmath8 , while cms data prefer a narrow width .",
    "naturally , further data collected at the lhc should provide a clearer picture as to the nature of this excess .",
    "there has been vast interest in the possibility that the diphoton excess results from physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "most discussion has focused on models where the excess is due to a new scalar particle which subsequently decays into two photons e.g. @xcite ( for a recent discussion see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility that the new scalar particle is a bound state of exotic charged fermions has also been considered , e.g. @xcite .",
    "here we consider the case that the 750 gev state is a non - relativistic bound state constituted by an exotic _ scalar _ particle @xmath0 and its antiparticle , charged under @xmath1 as well as a new unbroken non - abelian gauge interaction .",
    "having @xmath0 be a scalar rather than a fermion is not merely a matter of taste : in such a framework a fermionic @xmath0 would lead to the formation of bound states which ( typically ) decay to dileptons more often than to photons ; a situation which is not favoured by the data .",
    "the bound state , which we denote @xmath9 , can be produced through gluon ",
    "gluon fusion directly ( i.e. at threshold @xmath10 ) or indirectly via @xmath11 ( i.e. above @xmath9 threshold : @xmath12 ) .",
    "the indirect production mechanism can dominate the production of the bound state , which is an interesting feature of this kind of theory .",
    "we take the new confining unbroken gauge interaction to be @xmath13 , and assume that , like @xmath1 , it is asymptotically free and confining at low energies . however , the new @xmath13 dynamics is qualitatively different from qcd as all the matter particles ( assumed to be in the fundamental representation of @xmath13 ) are taken to be much heavier than the confinement scale , @xmath14 .",
    "in fact we here consider only one such matter particle , @xmath0 , so that @xmath15 is assumed . in this circumstance",
    "a @xmath16 pair produced at the lhc above the threshold @xmath17 but below @xmath18 can not fragment into two jets .",
    "the @xmath13 string which connects them can not break as there are no light @xmath13-charged states available .",
    "this is in contrast to heavy quark production in qcd where light quarks can be produced out of the vacuum enabling the color string to break .",
    "the produced @xmath19 pair can be viewed as a highly excited bound state , which de - excites by @xmath13-ball and soft glueball / pion emission  @xcite .    with the new unbroken gauge interaction assumed to be @xmath13 the gauge symmetry of the sm",
    "is extended to @xmath20 this kind of theory can arise naturally in models which feature large colour groups  @xcite and in models with leptonic colour  @xcite but was also considered earlier by okun  @xcite . the notation _",
    "quirks _ for heavy particles charged under an unbroken gauge symmetry ( where @xmath21 ) was introduced in  @xcite where the relevant phenomenology was examined in some detail in a particular model .",
    "confining scale is low ( @xmath22 kev ) , a situation which leads to macroscopic strings @xcite . ] for convenience we borrow their nomenclature and call the new quantum number _ hue _ and the massless gauge bosons _ huons _ ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the phenomenological signatures of the bound states ( quirkonia ) formed depend on whether the quirk is a fermion or boson . here",
    "we assume that the quirk @xmath0 is a lorentz scalar in light of previous work which indicated that bound states formed from a fermionic @xmath0 state would be expected to be observed at the lhc via decays of the spin 1 bound state into opposite - sign lepton pairs ( @xmath24 )  @xcite . in fact , this appears to be a serious difficulty in attempts to interpret the 750 gev state as a bound state of fermionic quirk particles ( such as those of @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed consideration of a scalar @xmath0 appears to have been largely overlooked , perhaps due to the paucity of known elementary scalar particles . with the recent discovery of a higgs - like scalar at 125 gev",
    "@xcite it is perhaps worth examining signatures of scalar quirk particles .",
    "in fact , we point out here that the two photon decay is the most important experimental signature of bound states formed from electrically charged scalar quirks .",
    "furthermore this explanation is only weakly constrained by current data and thus appears to be a simple and plausible option for the new physics suggested by the observed diphoton excess .",
    "m4.1 cm m4.1 cm m3.0 cm m2.86 cm m2.1 cm   &   &   &   &     the scalar @xmath0 that we introduce transforms under the extended gauge group ( eq .  [ eq : gaugegroup ] ) as @xmath25 where we use the normalization @xmath26 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath0 also transforms non - trivially under @xmath27 is interesting , however for the purposes of this letter we focus on the @xmath27 singlet case for definiteness .",
    "since two - photon decays of non - relativistic quirkonium will be assumed to be responsible for the diphoton excess observed at the lhc , the mass of @xmath0 will need to be around 375 gev .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath0 is charged under @xmath1 so that it can be produced at tree - level through qcd - driven pair production .",
    "we present the production mechanisms in fig .",
    "[ fig : prod ] . to estimate the production cross section of the bound states , we first consider the indirect production mechanism which we expect to be dominant . here , a @xmath16 pair is produced above threshold and de - excites emitting soft glueballs / pions and hueballs : @xmath28 .",
    "we first consider the case where the confinement scale of the new @xmath13 interaction is similar to that of qcd .",
    "what happens in this case can be adapted from the discussion in @xcite , where a fermionic quirk charged under an unbroken @xmath2 gauge interaction was considered .",
    "as already briefly discussed in the introduction , the @xmath29 pairs initially form a highly excited bound state , which subsequently de - excites in two stages .",
    "the first stage is the non - perturbative regime where the hue string is longer than @xmath30 .",
    "the second stage is characterized by a string scale significantly less than @xmath30 : the perturbative coulomb region . here",
    "the bound state can be characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "de - excitation continues until quirkonium is in a lowly excited state with @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "imagine first that de - excitation continued until the ground state ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) is reached .",
    "given we are considering @xmath0 to be a scalar , the quirkonium ground state , @xmath9 , will have spin 0 , and is thus expected to decay into sm gauge bosons and huons .",
    "the cross section @xmath36 in this case is then @xmath37    since production is governed by qcd interactions , we can use the values of the pair production cross sections for stops / sbottoms in the limit of decoupled squarks and gluinos  @xcite . for a @xmath0 mass of 375 gev",
    "@xmath38 the branching fraction is to leading order : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the new @xmath13 interaction strength and we have neglected the small contribution of @xmath42 to the total width .",
    "[ 5a ] also neglects the decay to higgs particles : @xmath43 , which arises from the higgs potential portal term @xmath44 .",
    "theoretically this rate is unconstrained given the dependence on the unknown parameter @xmath45 , but could potentially be important .",
    "however , limits from resonant higgs boson pair production derived from 13 tev data : @xmath46 fb at @xmath47 gev @xcite imply that the higgs decay channel must indeed be subdominant ( cf .",

    "annihilations of excited states can also contribute .",
    "however those with @xmath35 will decay in the same way as the ground state .",
    "the only difference is that the excited states will have a slightly larger mass ( which we will estimate in a moment ) due to the change in the binding energy .",
    "this detail could be important as it can effectively enlarge the observed width .",

    "the mass degeneracy of the multiplet will be broken at tree - level by higgs potential terms along with electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "the net effect is that the predicted width of the @xmath81 bump can be effectively larger as there are @xmath82 distinct bound states , @xmath83 , ( of differing masses ) which can each contribute to the decay width .",
    "although each state is expected to have a narrow width , when smeared by the detector resolution the effect can potentially be a broad feature .",

    "in particular , the hueballs can become so heavy that the decays of the bound state into hueballs is kinematically forbidden .",

    "is sufficiently large , one can potentially have direct resonance production comparable or even dominating indirect production ( such a scenario has been contemplated recently in @xcite ) .",
    "naturally at such large @xmath72 the perturbative calculations become unreliable , and one would have to resort to non - perturbative techniques such as lattice computations . ]",
    "we now comment on the regime where @xmath14 is smaller than @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , if the @xmath13 confining scale is only a little smaller than @xmath99 then a light quark pair can form out of the vacuum , leading to a bound state of two qcd color singlet states : @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these color singlet states would themselves be bound together by @xmath13 gauge interactions to form the @xmath13 singlet bound state . since only @xmath13 interactions bind the two composite states ( @xmath100 and @xmath102 )",

    "therefore if the confinement scale of @xmath13 is smaller than that of qcd then the direct production rate becomes completely negligible relative to the indirect production mechanism .",
    "the rate of @xmath9 production is the same as that found earlier in eq .  [ eq : ind1 ] , but the branching ratio to two photons is modified : @xmath104 where , as before , we have neglected the small contribution of @xmath105 to the total width , and also the contribution from @xmath106 . in this regime",
    "somewhat larger values of @xmath58 can be accommodated , such as @xmath107 for @xmath51 . in a more elaborate framework",
    ", we nevertheless remark here that particles fitting its description are required for spontaneous symmetry breaking of extended pati - salam type unified theories @xcite . ]",
    "notice that in the @xmath108 regime the size of the mass splittings between the excited states becomes small as @xmath109 in eq .",
    "[ eq:8y ] .",
    "we therefore expect no effective width enhancement due to the excited state decays at the lhc in the small @xmath14 regime .",
    "of course a larger effective width is still possible if there are several nearly degenerate scalar quirk states , which , as briefly mentioned earlier , can arise if @xmath0 transforms nontrivially under @xmath27 .",
    "while the two photon decay channel of the bound state should be the most important signature , the dominant decay is expected to be via @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the former process is expected to lead to dijet production while the latter will be an invisible decay .",
    "the dijet cross section is easily estimated : @xmath112 the limit from 8 tev data is @xmath113 pb  @xcite .",
    "if gluons dominate the @xmath9 decays ( i.e. @xmath114 ) then this experimental limit is satisfied for @xmath115 . for sufficiently large @xmath41",
    "the invisible decay can be enhanced , thereby reducing @xmath116 . in this circumstance",
    "the bound on @xmath59 from dijet searches would weaken .",
    "the invisible decays @xmath111 are not expected to lead to an observable signal at leading order for much of the parameter space of interest . however , the bremsstrahlung of a hard gluon from the initial state : @xmath117 can lead to a jet plus missing transverse energy signature .",
    "current data are not expected to give stringent limits from such decay channels , however this signature could become important when a larger data sample is collected .",
    "note though that the rate will become negligible in the limit that @xmath41 becomes small .",
    "also , in the small @xmath14 regime , where the bound state is formed from @xmath118 and @xmath101 , the two - body decay @xmath119 ( @xmath4 ) will also arise as in this case the scalar quirk pair is not necessarily in the color singlet configuration .",
    "the decay rate at leading order is substantial : @xmath120 nevertheless , we estimate that this is still consistent with current data @xcite , but would be expected to become important when a larger data sample is collected",
    ".    another important signature of the model will be the @xmath121 and @xmath122 processes .",
    "the rates of these decays , relative to @xmath123 , are estimated to be : @xmath124 if @xmath0 transforms nontrivially under @xmath125 then deviations from these predicted rates arize along with the tree - level decay @xmath126 .",
    "we have considered a charged scalar particle @xmath0 of mass around 375 gev charged under both @xmath1 and a new confining gauge interaction ( assigned to be @xmath13 for definiteness ) .",
    "these interactions confine @xmath19 into non - relativistic bound states whose decays into photons can explain the 750 gev diphoton excess observed at the lhc . taking the new confining group to be @xmath2",
    ", we found that the diphoton excess required @xmath0 to have electric charge approximately @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "an important feature of our model is that the exotic particle @xmath0 has a mass much greater than the @xmath13-confinement scale @xmath14 . in the absence of light @xmath13-charged matter fields",
    "this makes the dynamics of this new interaction qualitatively different to that of qcd : pair production of the scalars and the subsequent formation of the bound state dominates over direct bound state resonance production ( at least in the perturbative regime where @xmath127 ) . since @xmath0 is a lorentz scalar , decays of @xmath16 bound states to lepton pairs",
    "are naturally suppressed , and thus constraints from dilepton searches at the lhc can be ameliorated .",
