    "( 5.0,4.5 ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    ( 0.0,4.0 )    [ sed ]    v4334  sgr ( sakurai s object ) is a low - mass ( @xmath3 ) star that is retracing its post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution along the hertzsprung - russell diagram following a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) @xcite . the star was discovered in early 1996 @xcite , and was found to be at the centre of a faint planetary nebula ( pn ) of diameter @xmath4 ( e.g. pollacco 1999 ) .",
    "it first appeared as an f supergiant , possibly with a hot dust shell @xcite .",
    "analysis of the optical spectrum for mid-1996 by asplund et al . revealed that sakurai s object had undergone a transformation to a hydrogen - deficient , carbon - rich star and that the elemental abundances of a range of species were close to those found in the r  crb stars .",
    "they also used the c@xmath5 ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 0 - 1 ) swan bands at 4740  and 5635  respectively to determine that the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio was in the range 1.5 - 5 .",
    "pavlenko et al .",
    "used the first - overtone co bands to determine that the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio was @xmath6 .",
    "this is substantially less than the value in ( for example ) the solar system ( @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 70 ; mathis 2000 ) and likely arises from second stage cno cycling following he burning in the vltp @xcite .    in 1998",
    ", sakurai s object was completely obscured by an optically thick dust shell from which ( as of december 2005 ) it has still not emerged .",
    "indeed analysis of the infrared ( ir ) spectrum showed that dust emission has been making an increasing contribution to the ir emission since 1997 april @xcite . since the major dust event of 1998 , the 1 - 5spectrum is black body - like and is that of the ejected dust shell .",
    "analysis of the post-1998 ir observations has shown that the dust is carbon , primarily in amorphous form @xcite .",
    "the 1 - 5spectra during the period 1999 - 2001 were consistent with massloss that increased from @xmath7 to @xmath8 for a gas - to - dust ratio 200 , appropriate for solar abundances ( note that a lower gas - to - dust ratio of 75 was suggested by evans et al .",
    "for the hydrogen - deficient , carbon - rich wind of sakurai s object ) . the maximum grain radius ( in a grain size distribution @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ) increased by a factor @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "sub - millimetre observations @xcite show that the flux density at 450  and 850  was still rising in 2003 , indicating that the massloss was being maintained ; the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) resembled a black - body at 360  k.    observations of [ n]@xmath12 and [ o]@xmath13 in the spectrum of sakurai s object in 2002 @xcite hinted that the stellar temperature had increased from @xmath14  k in 1997 to @xmath15  k. the reheating seems to be confirmed by recent observations at 8.6  ghz with the vla @xcite , which detected free - free emission from the newly - ionized gas .",
    "we describe here observations of sakurai s object with the infrared spectrometer ( irs ) @xcite on the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "sakurai s object was observed in stare mode with the irs on 2005 april 15 ut ( pid  03362 ; aor key 10840320 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained with both low and high resolution modes , covering the spectral range of 538 , and the red peak - ap array used to precisely centre the object in the irs slits .",
    "we executed five 6-second ramps for a total observation time ( including overheads ) of 1042.6  s. the spectra in the wavelength range @xmath16  were saturated and are not presented here .",
    "the spectrum was extracted from the version 12.3 processed pipeline data product using spice version 1.1 @xcite .",
    "high resolution segments were stitched together without any continuum normalization .",
    "the dust shell , which condensed and became optically thick in 1998 @xcite still dominates the ir sed from 538(see fig .",
    "[ sed]a ) .",
    "much of the scatter in the data in fig .",
    "[ sed]a consists of low - level features superimposed on the dust continuum ( see fig .",
    "[ sed]b ) , and will be discussed in detail in a future paper .",
    "the depression in the sed around 13likely is due to the superposition of many ro - vibrational bands of hydrocarbon molecules ( see  [ absorption ] below ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ i d ]      the sed is far from smooth over the entire irs wavelength range .",
    "there are several obvious absorption features superimposed on the dust continuum , at 13.688 , 14.025 , 14.135 , 15.079 , 15.918 , 16.085(see fig .",
    "[ sed]b ) .",
    "the only plausible identifications for these features ( see table  [ i d ] ) are h@xmath0cn , h@xmath1cn , hc@xmath17n , and the carbon chain molecules ( polyynes ) acetylene ( ) , diacetylene ( ) and triacetylene ( ) .",
    "we use the hcn features to estimate the columns of h@xmath0cn and h@xmath1cn , and temperature of the absorbing material . for h@xmath0cn",
    "we take einstein coefficients and other relevant data from harris , polyansky & tennyson , and partition functions from barber , harris & tennyson ; the corresponding quantities for h@xmath1cn were kindly provided by dr g. harris ( private communication ) .",
    "the optical depth in the hcn features was determined relative to a local continuum in the 1317  wavelength region .",
    "we consider an elementary model in which the absorbing gas is homogeneous and isothermal and located in front of the dust shell ; each hcn transition is assumed to have intrinsic width 10  @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and broadened by a gaussian having width corresponding to the resolution of the irs .",
    "the column density - temperature ( @xmath20 ) parameter space was searched , independently for h@xmath0cn and h@xmath1cn , to find the best fit ; we find ( see fig .  [ hcn ] )    1 .",
    "@xmath21  @xmath22 , @xmath23  k ( h@xmath0cn ) and 2 .",
    "@xmath24  @xmath22 , @xmath25  k ( h@xmath1cn ) .",
    "the greatest uncertainty is in the column rather than temperature ; the line profile is sensitive to the latter , while the former is more sensitive to the placement of the continuum .",
    "we do not expect the temperatures of the h@xmath0cn and h@xmath1cn regions to differ , and the above values of @xmath26 are consistent within the errors . for the purpose of discussion",
    "we take @xmath27  k , for which @xmath28  @xmath22 ( h@xmath0cn ) and @xmath29  @xmath22 ( h@xmath1cn ; see fig .",
    "[ hcn ] ) .",
    "this immediately gives us the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio as @xmath2 , consistent with the value @xmath6 obtained by pavlenko et al . from fitting the first overtone co bands in the near - ir , and with the vltp interpretation of sakurai s object .",
    "we note that the @xmath30 band of @xmath1c@xmath0ch@xmath5 is blended with the corresponding @xmath30 band of @xmath0c@xmath5h@xmath5 @xcite and , at the resolution of the spitzer irs , can not be used to provide an alternative estimate of the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio .",
    "similarly , we do not expect to see the effect of @xmath0c@xmath31c substitution in the polyynes in our data .",
    "however , for @xmath27  k and assuming the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio deduced from the hcn lines , the column density for  is @xmath32  @xmath22 , where we have taken partition functions from gamache , hawkins & rothman and spectroscopic data from the hitran database @xcite .      in view of the increased temperature of the stellar remnant @xcite",
    "we expect the appearance of ir fine structure lines as the wind is ionized . in the case of v605  aql , which is @xmath33  years ahead of sakurai s object in its evolution ,",
    "we clearly see [ ne ]  @xmath34  ( line flux @xmath35  w  m@xmath36 ) and [ ne ]  @xmath37(@xmath38  w  m@xmath36 ) in the spitzer irs spectrum , although the dust shell is clearly much cooler ( see fig .  [ v605 ] ) .",
    "however there is no evidence for the presence of these emission lines in the spitzer spectrum of sakurai s object , to a limit of @xmath39  w  m@xmath36 for both [ ne ] and [ ne ] , that we can attribute to increased ionization of the ejected gas as the effective temperature of the star increases .",
    "the temperature of the dust `` photosphere '' is @xmath40  k ( see  [ cont ] ) , so we seem to have the unphysical situation that the temperature of the absorbing gas ( @xmath41  k ) is greater than that of the dust .",
    "cernicharo et al .",
    "note that the 14  hcn feature can appear in emission if the hcn - bearing material is close to the star .",
    "the fact that it is in absorption in sakurai s object indicates that this material is unlikely to be close to the star , while the kinetic temperature of 450  k indicates heating by ultraviolet photons in a thin layer of gas . for this to occur",
    "the radiation must penetrate the optically thick dust shell , which is possible only if the dust distribution has strong asymmetry .",
    "the hcn column is @xmath42  @xmath22 , but his should be regarded as a lower limit because , as noted above , the geometry of the dust and hcn is likely to be more complex than we have assumed here .",
    "indeed high resolution ir spectroscopy @xcite around the he@xmath43 line suggests that the distribution of matter in the outflow from sakurai s object is not spherically symmetric , as our dusty modelling has assumed ( again underlining that the dust properties and distribution are not well known ) .",
    "rather the dust may be distributed in an equatorial ` torus ' , to which the he and hcn ` wind ' is orthogonal .",
    "although the spitzer irs does not give sufficient spectral resolution to determine a doppler shift for hcn , in the case of the he@xmath43 line there is clear evidence of outflow .",
    "tyne et al . found outflows with @xmath44 .",
    "however the deduced @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio should be relatively insensitive to the geometry .",
    "( 5.0,4 . )",
    "( 0.0,4.0 )      it is remarkable that the hydrogen - deficient , carbon - rich sakurai s object should display absorption lines of h - containing species .",
    "the presence of h - bearing molecules in the spitzer irs spectra ( fig .",
    "[ sed]b ) might imply that these features from material ejected by sakurai s object prior to its current hydrogen - deficient state .",
    "however the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio clearly demonstrates that the absorbing material must be a product of the vltp .",
    "( 5.0,4 . )",
    "( 0.0,4.0 )    it is therefore of interest to consider the origin of these species . in the case of irc+10@xmath45216 ,",
    "the proto - typical carbon - rich post - agb star , chemistry takes place in the photochemistry zone and polyynes are produced via the reactions : @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this requires the presence of c@xmath5h , which is formed from c@xmath5h@xmath5 by photodissociation , i.e. polyynes do not form before c@xmath5h@xmath5 is present .",
    "furthermore , cernicharo has shown , in the context of the proto - planetary nebula crl618 , that carbon - rich molecules are formed in the presence of a strong photodissociating radiation field .",
    "it generally seems the case therefore that the chemistry leading to these species requires the presence of radiation .",
    "such an environment might exist in the case of sakurai s object along the ` wind ' axis postulated in ",
    "however whether the chemistry that led to the hydrocarbons we see in sakurai s object is a relatively recent phenomenon , or whether it is the result of earlier chemical processes whose products have been ` frozen in ' is unclear .",
    "we have reported an observation of v4334  sgr ( sakurai s object ) with the spitzer irs .",
    "we find that the ir sed is dominated by the optically thick dust shell that still enshrouds the stellar remnant .",
    "the dust shell `` photosphere '' has a temperature @xmath40  k , while the temperature of the inner dust shell is inferred to be @xmath47  k. there is evidence that the condensation of new dust has ceased , and that the character of the dust has changed since 2001 .",
    "there are several prominent absorption features , which we attribute to hcn , acetylene and polyynes .",
    "the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio is @xmath11 ; this is substantially smaller than the solar system value ( @xmath48 ) and is consistent with ( a )  the cno cycling following the vltp , and ( b )  the value obtained from the ir first overtone co bands .",
    "we see no evidence for the presence of emission lines ( such as [ ne ]  @xmath34 , [ ne ]  @xmath37 ) that would be a signature of the anticipated increased @xmath49 of the star .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
