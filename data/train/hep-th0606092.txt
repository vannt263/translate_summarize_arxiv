    "quantum theories in the presence of background fields naturally arise in many different physical situations , like when considering the effects of classical gravitational or electromagnetic background fields on the vacuum persistence amplitude . besides , the consideration of ` classical ' backgrounds is sometimes an important intermediate step in the context of the functional quantization approach , whereby one considers ( trivial or non trivial ) classical backgrounds . those configurations",

    "this approach , introduced in  @xcite , has been adapted to the case of the electromagnetic field satisfying perfect conductor boundary conditions on the borders @xcite , and successfully applied to the calculation of casimir forces in different geometries @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to implement the boundary conditions as delta functions in the functional integral , and to write them in terms of auxiliary fields living on the boundaries . here",

    "we apply them , in the following sections , to calculate the effective action under different approximation schemes and simplifying assumptions . in section  [ sec : casimir ] , we consider the casimir energy for massless dirac fermions , which is derived from the effective action with a vanishing gauge field , for the special geometry of two parallel plates .    in section  [ sec : largem ] , we evaluate the effective action in a large-@xmath2 approximation , for the case on an arbitrary external gauge field .",
    "this yields a contribution coming from the boundary modes , which is local when the mass tends to infinity . in this section",
    ", we also discuss the same system from a different point of view : we start from the ` dual ' or bosonized version of the dirac field in the large - mass limit , which is a chern - simons action .",
    "this action is then constrained to satisfy the corresponding boundary condition , which now is a kind of ` perfect conductor ' boundary condition for the chern - simons gauge field .",
    "we obtain the resulting functional integral for the boundary modes , and compare with the previous result .    in section",
    "[ sec : linear ] , we consider the dependence of the effective action on the external gauge field , for the particular case of a linear wall .",

    "besides , when considering the large - mass limit , we shall also need to invoke an alternative description for the curve @xmath4 , obtained by introducing @xmath28 and @xmath29 , two orthogonal curvilinear coordinates for the plane , in such a way that @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath30 . since they are orthogonal coordinates , the square of @xmath31 can be written as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 may depend on @xmath28 and @xmath29 . a further simplification",

    "the @xmath28-constant lines are obtained by using the property that @xmath25 is tangent to them ( at every point on the curve ) .",
    "equipped with the previous definitions , we introduce bag - like boundary conditions on @xmath4 for the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the projectors : @xmath41 where the dot denotes the scalar product between ( spatial ) @xmath14-component vectors : @xmath42 . the conditions ( [ eq : bagbc ] ) ensure the vanishing , at all the points of @xmath4 , of @xmath43 , the normal component of the induced fermion current : @xmath44 here , the vacuum average @xmath45 is defined by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 means that the integration is constrained to verify the proper boundary conditions , we shall see how to implement them by the use of lagrange multipliers ( see below ) .",

    "this fact prevents the introduction of one - component weyl fermions as auxiliary fields , since their local ( point dependent ) definitions would render the apparent simplification illusory .",
    "we shall however , in some special situations , use weyl fermions : that will be the case when the normal vector @xmath63 is piecewise constant , like in the calculation of the casimir effect for parallel ` plates ' ( lines ) .",
    "the determinant factor on the rhs of ( [ eq : zf1 ] ) agrees with the would - be @xmath64 when the borders are sent to infinity ( i.e. , when there are no borders ) . since we are interested precisely in the effects due to the presence of borders , we shall factor out that contribution , considering instead : @xmath65 thus , the effective action corresponding to this functional is given by @xmath66    at this point , it is useful to disentangle from @xmath67 the purely casimir energy contribution from the part due to the external field : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is proportional to the casimir energy density @xmath70 , while @xmath71 , which vanishes when @xmath72 , is a measure of the effect of the borders on the response of the system to the external field .",

    "we see that ( [ eq : ward5 ] ) is relevant to the physical problem of imposing bag - like boundary conditions .",

    "if the former is not zero , the latter is necessarily different from zero .",
    "the explicit form for the anomaly is , in these coordinates ( @xmath87 , @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "thus the non - vanishing of the anomlous contribution depends only on the circulation of @xmath99 ( which is the tangential component of @xmath76 on @xmath4 ) at the times @xmath100 and @xmath12 .",

    "indeed , that is the usual set - up for the study of this phenomenon , which is dealt with in the context of the effective theory for the bulk , and the dynamics for the boundary modes is obtained therefrom  @xcite .",
    "of course , the gauge non - invariance could be cured by adjusting the matter content , or by imposing conditions on the external gauge field , like the invariance of the total magnetic flux through @xmath3 .",
    "let us derive now an expression for the fermion propagator by using this representation .",

    "@xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114    in section  [ sec : linear ] , we will find an explicit expression for the free fermion propagator in the presence of a linear wall .",
    "let us consider here the casimir term @xmath69 , for the physically interesting case of @xmath115 , evaluating it explicitly for a particular geometry .",
    "we first write this object more explicitly , in terms of the corresponding functional integral over auxiliary fields : @xmath116 the simplest non - trivial geometry is the one corresponding to the region : @xmath117 , so that @xmath118 is just the union of two lines : @xmath119 , corresponding to @xmath120 and @xmath121 , to @xmath122 . of course , in this case , the normal vectors shall be @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively . in order to parametrize the auxiliary fields ,",
    "we find it convenient to use @xmath125 as the ( common ) parameter , but using a label to distinguish the fields corresponding to the lower ( @xmath126 ) , and upper ( @xmath127 ) borders .",
    "then , @xmath128 where the ` action ' @xmath129 is defined by : @xmath130\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 .",
    "it should be clear now that , since these projectors are constant , the auxiliary fields @xmath132 , when multiplied by those projectors , are trivial functions of ( different ) one - component weyl fermions .",
    "namely , @xmath133 and @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and their adjoints , are one - component weyl fields .",
    "we may combine them into a two - component field @xmath137 : @xmath138 and write the action @xmath129 as : @xmath139 where @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "then we have , @xmath143 which is best evaluated by introducing a fourier transformation with respect to the coordinates @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we see that : @xmath146 then : @xmath147 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath148 is the length of the plates , and @xmath100 the extension of the ( euclidean ) time interval . in this expression , there is a ( divergent ) @xmath149-independent contribution which we attribute to the self - energy or each plate , plus a casimir energy ( energy per unit length ) : @xmath150 which can be easily integrated : @xmath151    an interesting feature of this result is that the casimir energy is already given by an _",
    "integral _ over the momenta which are parallel to the plates .",
    "thus , the series over the discrete momenta along the normal direction to the plates has already been summed up .    of course , both approaches are related , as can be easily seen by first noting that the eigenvalues of @xmath152 are identical to the squares of the eigenvalues of a dirac _ hamiltonian _ in @xmath153 dimensions ( with one of the spatial coordinates playing the role of the time ) .",
    "those eigenvalues are known to be  @xcite : @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "then we see that : @xmath156 \\;,\\ ] ] where we have neglected @xmath149-independent terms .",
    "the sum on the rhs of ( [ eq : series ] ) arises naturally when one evaluates the casimir energy by finding the eigenvalues of the dirac operator for the modes constrained to satisfy the bag boundary conditions .",
    "one can also obtain an expression similar to ( [ intcas ] ) for the casimir energy starting from its usual definition as the sum of the zero - point energies of the field modes , and using cauchy s theorem to write the sum as a contour integral in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "we shall approach this limit by following two different strategies : first , we shall begin with a quantized dirac field , implementing the approximations and simplifications that follow from the assumption that the fermionic mass is much larger than the other relevant dimensionful objects ; i.e. , the gauge field derivatives .",
    "our second approach amounts to start from the effective ` bosonized ' theory that follows by taking the large - mass limit beforehand , and introducing the boundary condition afterwards .      in the large mass limit",
    ", we can obtain some explicit results as a consequence of the fact that the kernel @xmath157 becomes _",
    "local_. we begin by noting that @xmath75 may be regarded as a regularized version ( with the fermion mass @xmath2 playing the role of an @xmath158 cutoff ) of the determinant of a _ local _ operator . indeed , taking into account the fact that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are orthogonal projectors at every point of @xmath4 , we may rewrite @xmath157 as : @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath160 , and @xmath161 and all its derivatives tend to zero when @xmath162 , it is evident that @xmath75 is a regularized version of another functional , which we denote by @xmath163 , defined as the result of taking the @xmath164 limit in @xmath75 : @xmath165_{m \\to \\infty } \\;=\\ ; \\int \\ ; { \\mathcal d } \\chi { \\mathcal d } { \\bar\\chi } \\ ; e^{- s_{loc } \\big({\\bar\\chi},\\,\\chi,\\,a \\big ) } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath166 and : @xmath167 is a local action , and we have neglected an infinite ( @xmath76-independent ) factor @xmath168 .",
    "it is important at this point to remark that , since the auxiliary fields behave as @xmath54 dimensional dirac fermions with a minimal gauge coupling , no infinity arises when removing the regulator ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "of course , this will not necessarily be the case in higher dimensions . besides , the regulator only affects the real part of the effective action ( namely , the modulus of the fermionic determinant ) .",
    "the imaginary part is of course still there , and requires its own regularization .",
    "note , however , that the imaginary part is also determined by the local action , since the ` regulator ' affects only the modulus of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator , and those are gauge invariant .",
    "it should be obvious that , to make further progress , it is convenient to write ( [ eq : defkloc ] ) more explicitly , in terms of coordinates which are more adapted to the geometry of @xmath4 . to that end , we invoke the coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 , introduced in the previous section , recalling that @xmath28 and @xmath170 actually coincide on @xmath4 , to see that the local action may be written as follows : @xmath171 where : @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 and @xmath175    note that there is no coupling to the component of @xmath76 that is normal to the curve .",
    "then , in the infinite mass limit , the effective action due to the presence of the boundary reduces to the one of a chiral fermion determinant : @xmath176 \\;.\\ ] ]    by our comment above on the imaginary part , it is clear that : @xmath177 where , of course , a regularization procedure has to be invoked ( as it has to be also in a local theory ) .      to describe a dirac field coupled to an external gauge field @xmath10 we may ,",
    "in the limit when the fermion mass is large ( in comparison with the momenta of the external fields ) use an approximate bosonization procedure  @xcite .",
    "the fermion @xmath178 boson mapping leads to a bosonic action , @xmath179 , whose leading form in a large - mass expansion is given by : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is a new gauge field , introduced to implement the duality , and @xmath182 is the chern - simons action : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is a constant .    the second term in ( [ eq : bosact ] ) corresponds to the standard coupling between current and external gauge field , since @xmath181 is related to the average value of the fermionic current , @xmath185 , by : @xmath186 a relation which is exact , i.e , independent of the approximation used to obtain the bosonized action .    the bosonized partition function _ in the absence of boundaries _ , @xmath187 ,",
    "can be defined as follows : @xmath188    to take into account the boundary conditions corresponding to the fermionic theory in this setting , we note that the mapping between the fermionic and bosonic representations for the current implies that we should impose : @xmath189 i.e. , the wall must behave like a ` perfect conductor ' for the @xmath181 gauge field , since there is no tangential component for its electric field on the border .",
    "note that this boundary condition is independent of the large mass expansion , since it only relies upon the exact mapping ( [ eq : dual ] ) between @xmath185 and @xmath181 .",
    "introducing now a new field @xmath190 , a lagrange multiplier field for the previous condition , we are lead to @xmath191 , the bosonized form of the partition function for the contribution due to the modes localized on the borders : @xmath192 where now @xmath193 where @xmath194 .",
    "when evaluating the gaussian integral , an important point arises as a consequence of the existence of a boundary term coming from an integration by parts . indeed , to perform the gaussian integral",
    "we need to rewrite the term that couples the bosonized current to the external field @xmath10 . after performing an integration by parts and applying gauss theorem",
    ", we see that : @xmath195 where @xmath196 to keep this boundary term amounts to reproducing the proper result , in particular for the anomalous behaviour of the effective action under gauge transformations .",
    "the gaussian integral over @xmath181 can now be performed , what yields an action @xmath129 for the lagrange multiplier field : @xmath197 where a ` bulk ' chern - simons term has been cancelled out , and : @xmath198 where @xmath199 , and @xmath200    it is straightforward to see that ( [ eq : sc ] ) has the same transformation properties as its fermionic equivalent .",
    "indeed , all the terms in @xmath201 except for the last one are invariant under gauge transformations restricted to the border : @xmath202 if the scalar field is also transformed : @xmath203 it is clear that the last term in @xmath129 does reproduce the chiral anomaly , since under the previous gauge transformation : @xmath204 which is , of course , consistent with the result obtained from the fermionic representation .",
    "the results agree when @xmath205 , which is the proper value for the bosonized theory with ` minimal ' regularization .",
    "in this section we calculate the free fermion propagator and the effective action for the particularly simple case of a linear boundary , which we assume to be at @xmath206 , with .",
    "let us first consider the free fermion propagator .",
    "using @xmath144 and @xmath145 as coordinates we write the free kernel @xmath207 as @xmath208 . inserting this expression into ( [ freeprop ] ) , after some algebra we obtain : @xmath209 @xmath210 where @xmath211 , and @xmath212    now we consider the evaluation of the effective action @xmath213 , which is given by @xmath214 with @xmath215 note that , in the previous expression , the dirac operator in the denominator will in general depend on @xmath216 , which does not commute with @xmath217 .",
    "thus , in general , no simpler expression may be written for ( [ eq : linear2 ] ) unless some simplifying assumptions are introduced .",
    "assuming that the @xmath10 s are smooth functions of @xmath218 in the region around @xmath120 , the leading term in a @xmath217 derivative expansion is @xmath219 @xmath220 or , @xmath221 latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : linear4 } \\langle x_0,x_1 | \\frac{-\\gamma_\\nu d_\\nu}{2 \\sqrt{-(\\gamma_\\mu d_\\mu)^2 + e^2 a_2 ^ 2(x_0.x_1,0)+ m^2 } } { \\mathcal p}_r    original problem , although at the expense of having to deal with a non - local theory .",
    "this non local kernel may properly be called the effective dirac operator for the boundary modes , in a _ microscopic _ representation .",
