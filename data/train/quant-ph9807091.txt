    "consider the following problem .",
    "alice and bob are far from each other , and they share one pair of spin-@xmath5 particles in entangled quantum state @xmath6 .",
    "all the manipulations alice and bob are alowwed to perform are local quantum operations and classical communication ( called lqcc or bi - local operations ) .",
    "it means that that , in particular , they can not exchange quantum bits or establish quantum interaction between their labs . now , suppose that alice wants to teleport an unknown state of some other spin-@xmath5 particle , but only if she is sure that the fidelity @xmath7 of the transfer is better than some given threshold @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . which states",
    "@xmath6 give alice nonzero chance that after some lqcc operations she can teleport being sure that the her requirement is satisfied ?",
    "the answer to this question will be one of the result of the presented paper .",
    "as one knows , quantum teleportation @xcite allows to transfer the quantum information through quantum entangled states as quantum channels ( supported by classical channels ) with the fidelity better than by means of classical channel itself @xcite .",
    "for example , two spin-@xmath5 particles in the maximally entangled state @xmath10 ( we shall call it singlet state , despite it is in fact local transformation of true singlet ) shared by a sender - alice - and a receiver - bob allows to transmit faithfully an unknown spin-@xmath5 state , with additional use of classical bits describing one of @xmath11 elementary messages . if the state shared by alice and bob is pure but not maximally entangled than one can perform _ conclusive _ teleportation @xcite",
    ". the main idea of the latter is that , given a particle in _ non - maximally _ entangled state @xmath12 providing small transmission fidelity @xmath7 , alice and bob can transform the state by some deliberate lqcc operations . as a result ,",
    "with some probability the final state provides much greater transmission fidelity ( usually the perfect one ) . in the proposed protocol @xcite",
    "the pairs of particles were treated _ non - collectively _",
    "i.e. each pair was processed separately .",
    "the concept of _ collective _ operations that involve interactions among different pairs , has been implemented for pure states in the protocol of _ concentration of entanglement _ by lqcc operations @xcite ( see @xcite for interesting consequences for entanglement measures and @xcite for analysis of probability distributions ) .",
    "it this approach some number of non - maximally entangled states is converted via lqcc operations into the less number of maximally entangled ones which can be used for instance for faithful teleportation process .    in realistic conditions , instead of pure entangled states",
    "alice and bob usually share mixed state that contains noisy entanglement .",
    "the latter case is more complex and it has longer history .",
    "popescu first has pointed out @xcite that mixed entangled states can allow for teleportation with significantly better fidelity than the one achieved by using only classical bits .",
    "he also showed @xcite that some non - collective lqcc operations can transform the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) werner entangled mixed states satisfying local hidden variable model @xcite into the two spin-@xmath15 states violating bell inequalities .",
    "subsequently , similar effect by means of local filtering for mixed two spin-@xmath15 states has been found @xcite ( see @xcite for pure state case ) . at the same time",
    "the important idea of _ distillation _ ( or _ purification _ ) of noisy entanglement has been worked out @xcite . here",
    "the aim is to convert some number of _ mixed _ inseparable states into less number of states close to maximally entangled pure one .",
    "the distillation protocols are usually accomplished by operating on collections of pairs rather than on single pairs .",
    "however , the single pair operations introduced in refs . @xcite have been shown to play an important role in the distillation protocol capable to distill _ all _ entangled two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , single pair operations are much simpler to perform experimentally @xcite .",
    "first general results concerning the limits for those operations have been provided by linden , massar and popescu @xcite and by kent @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to consider the question concerning the conclusive teleportation we asked at the beginning .",
    "we first reduce the question to the problem of single pair distillation . to this end",
    "we provide a number of tools which can be useful also in more general context .    in sec .",
    "[ isomorphism ] we consider the problem of equivalence between bipartite states and quantum channels .",
    "the connections between states and channels were considered in refs .",
    "it is clear that if we have channel , then we can produce a bipartite state sending a half of singlet down the channel @xcite .",
    "however , given a state , it is not clear , whether there is a channel , which can produce it in the above way . a way of ascribing channel to a given state is to perform teleportation via the state ( creating the teleportation channel ) one can now ask what channels can be produced by means of teleportation via a given mixed state . another question is the following @xcite : suppose that a mixed state was produced from a channel , by sending half of singlet .",
    "can we recover the channel by means of some ( probably very sophisticated ) teleportation scheme applied to the state ? this is the question of reversibility of the operation of producing states from channels . in sec .",
    "[ isomorphism ] we prove that the operation of sending half of singlet down the channel produces isomorphism between channels states having the reduced density matrix of one of subsystems maximally chaotic ( proportional to identity ) .",
    "the section [ fidelity - fraction ] is devoted to the problem of optimal fidelity of teleportation .",
    "we first consider families of states and channels connected via the above isomorphism .",
    "the states are singlets with admixture of completely mixed state @xcite ( generalization of two - qubit werner states @xcite ) which are the only states invariant under the @xmath16 twirling introduced in ref .",
    "the channels are the generalized depolarizing ones .",
    "we show that the families are not only connected via the isomorphism , but are also physically equivalent , i.e. the teleportation via state reproduces the channel .",
    "this generalizes similar observation for two - qubit werner states @xcite .",
    "we also introduce an operation on channels which is equivalent to twirling of the corresponding states .",
    "we show that average fidelity and the entanglement fidelity are invariants of the twirling operation .",
    "these are the main tools which allow us to prove a strict connection between the optimal fidelity @xmath0 of teleportation via a given state and the maximal singlet fraction @xmath1 attainable by means of trace preserving lqcc operations on single pair . namely we prove that there holds the equality @xmath17 .",
    "we emphasise here , that we consider the most general teleportation scheme which is possible .",
    "then the problem of optimal teleportation fidelity is reduced to the much less complicated ( but still nontrivial ) task of optimal increasing singlet fraction by means of trace - preserving lqcc operations .",
    "we illustrate the power of the result in sec .",
    "[ be ] applying it to the problem of optimal teleportation fidelity via bound entangled states ( the entangled ones which can not be distilled @xcite ) .",
    "this problem has been quite recently risen by linden and popescu @xcite who showed that some of bound entangled states do not provide better fidelity by teleportation via purely classical channel ( see @xcite in this context ) . here",
    "we prove that it is true for any bound entangled states and for the most general teleportation schemes .    in subsequent sections",
    "we apply the results to the problem of conclusive teleportation which is now reduced to the problem of conclusive increasing singlet fraction .",
    "we consider two concepts : ( i ) non - collective distillation , where alice and bob have a chance to obtain a perfect singlet and ( ii ) non - collective quasi - distillation ( in short quasi - distillation ) , where the perfect singlet can not be obtained , but there is nonzero chance to obtain arbitrarily high singlet fraction . from the results concerning non - collective distillation @xcite we know that for a broad class of mixtures it is impossible even to increase the singlet fraction . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the non - collective distillation is impossible for mixed states of full rank .",
    "here we address , in particular , the following question : does there exist a state which is not non - collectively distillable , but still is quasi - distillable ? to answer this question we determine ( in sec .",
    "[ distillation ] ) the class of the states which can be distilled ( we generalize the consideration taking into account the case of singlet of less dimension than the dimension of the system : this corresponds to fidelity teleportation with the average calculated over inputs restricted to less hilbert space ) . in sec .",
    "[ quasi - distillation ] we provide example of state which does not belong to this class , but can be quasi - distilled .",
    "then we slightly modify the state so that the new one can not be quasi - distilled having a threshold for singlet fraction which can not be exceeded .",
    "thus for sufficiently high required fidelity of teleportation , alice and bob have no chance to obtain the fidelity for this state .",
    "in this section we prove formally that the set of channels @xmath18 on the set of @xmath19-dimensional states is isomorphic to the set of density matrices @xmath6 acting on the hilbert space @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 ( the partial trace over the second system gives maximally mixed state ) . by channel",
    "we mean here completely positive , trace - preserving map @xcite . given a channel @xmath18",
    "one can ascribe to it a state @xmath22 , sending half of singlet state down the channel @xmath23 such a state must have the first reduction the same as the state @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath25 ) since , due to impossibility of action at a distance the local reduced density matrix of the remote half of @xmath24 can not be changed by any local action performed on the other half ( this is a `` physical '' version of the proof of this well known fact @xcite ) .",
    "now consider a given state @xmath6 , with first reduction equal to @xmath26 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , consider the spectral decomposition of the state @xmath27 let , e.g. , @xmath28 . then it can be represented as @xmath29 where @xmath30 . defining analogously @xmath31 for @xmath32",
    "we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "of course the map @xmath18 defined in this way is completely positive , since it is of the common stinespring form @xcite .",
    "it is also trace - preserving . to show it we only need to check whether @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "since the first reduction of our state @xmath6 is @xmath26 , we have for any operator @xmath36 @xmath37 now using the property that @xmath38 for any operator @xmath39 and the fact that the reduction of the singlet is @xmath26 we obtain @xmath40 for any @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that @xmath41 hence of course also @xmath42 .",
    "finally one should know that the channel @xmath18 is determined uniquely .",
    "suppose , that there are two maps @xmath18 and @xmath43 which produce the same state @xmath6 so that we have @xmath44 denote the difference @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath46 must be equal to @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , consider the operator basis constituted by the following operators @xmath48 . in that basis",
    "we have @xmath49 . substituting it into formula ( [ zero ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath50 where @xmath51 are matrix elements of @xmath46 in the basis @xmath52 .",
    "since the operators @xmath53 also constitute basis then it follows that all @xmath51 must vanish so that @xmath46 must be @xmath47 operator .",
    "then , we have shown that if two maps give raise to the same state @xmath6 then they must be equal , so that the formula ( [ map ] ) determines @xmath18 uniquely .",
    "thus it constitutes an affine _ isomorphism _ between channels and states of maximally mixed reduced density matrix on one of the subsystems .",
    "having proved the isomorphism , given a state @xmath6 we will denote by @xmath54 the unique channel satisfying ( [ map ] ) .",
    "conversely , given a channel @xmath18 we ascribe to it a state @xmath55 also by means of the formula ( [ map ] ) .",
    "note that so far this isomorphism has been established here only between channels i.e. completely positive trace - preserving maps and quantum states with one of subsystems being completely mixed .",
    "one can easily see that the isomorphism can be extended to all states if one abandon the condition of preserving the trace .",
    "then we have the one - to - one correspondence between the set of all states and the set of all completely positive maps .",
    "but we would like to stress here that we refer to a completely positive map as to a channel only if it is trace - preserving .",
    "let us now discuss the physical sense of the considered useful mathematical equivalence .",
    "if alice and bob are connected via a channel @xmath18 then they can create state @xmath22 by sending half of singlet down the channel . however , if they initially share the state @xmath22 , then can they say they dispose a channel @xmath18 ? as one knows , applying teleportation protocol , they , in fact , obtain some quantum channel .",
    "it remains an open question whether there exists some teleportation procedure which _ reproduce _ the channel @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it is highly probable that , in general , sending a half of singlet down the channel causes some _ irreversible _ lost of the capacity .",
    "thus , the mathematical equivalence would not imply the physical one in general .",
    "one knows that in some cases there is also a physical equivalence .",
    "namely , for the two - qubit werner state the corresponding channel ( quantum depolarizing channel ) can be retrieved by applying the standard teleportation protocol @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will show that the same reversibility holds for generalized depolarizing channel ( associated with the family of the @xmath4 invariant states ) .",
    "at the end of this section we define two parameters describing channels and states .",
    "we will use the same notation for states and for channels , but the parameters will of course have different interpretation .",
    "we will denote them by @xmath7 and @xmath56 .",
    "the first one is defined for channels in the following way @xmath57 where integral is performed with respect of the uniform distribution @xmath58 over all input pure states .",
    "it has the following interpretation : it is the probability that the output state @xmath59 passes the test of being the input state @xmath60 , averaged over all input states",
    ". we will call it fidelity of the channel .    for the states ,",
    "the parameter @xmath61 will denote the fidelity of the channel constituted by the standard teleportation via the the state @xmath6 .",
    "here we adjust the standard teleportation scheme @xcite so that it provides perfect transmission for the state of the form ( [ max ] ) rather than for the true singlet one ( as in original scheme ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 for states will denote simply the fraction of the singlet state given by @xmath62 .",
    "for the channels , we will denote by @xmath63 the entanglement fidelity of @xmath18 @xcite given exactly by @xmath64 .",
    "then if one sent half of singlet down the channel , the entanglement fidelity says how close is the output state to the input one . by definition ,",
    "@xmath56 is invariant under the isomorphism ( [ map ] ) .",
    "in this section we relate the optimal fidelity of teleportation via a given mixed state to the maximal singlet fraction attainable by means of _ trace - preserving _ lqcc operations .",
    "this will lead us in particular to the bound for fidelity of the conclusive teleportation in the case of quasi - distillation .",
    "our basic tool will be the novel twirling technique @xcite i.e. random application of @xmath4 unitary transformations .",
    "we also introduce _ twirling channels _ which is operation on channels analogous to twirling states .",
    "suppose that alice and bob share a pair of particles in a given state @xmath6 acting on the hilbert space @xmath65 and alice has a third particle in unknown state @xmath66 to be teleported .",
    "the standard teleportation scheme has been described in the introduction .",
    "the most general teleportation scheme is that bob and alice given the particles in states described above apply some trace - preserving ( hence without selection of ensemble ) lqcc operation @xmath67 to the particles they share and the alice s particle .",
    "after the operation the state of bob particle ( from the pair ) is to be close to the unknown state of the third particle .",
    "the final state of bob particle is given by the following formula @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{bob}\\ ] ] this establishes a quantum channel @xmath69 which maps the input state ( the state of the third particle ) onto the output one  the final state of bob particle @xmath70 this is a different way of ascribing a channel to the given state than the isomorphism ( [ map ] ) .",
    "it is determined by each established teleportation protocol @xmath67 , and in contrast to the isomorphism , it is in general not a one - to - one association : two different states @xmath6 and @xmath71 can give the same teleportation channel @xmath72 ( this was discussed in ref .",
    "the fidelity of a teleportation protocol @xmath67 ( via a given state @xmath6 ) is the fidelity of the arising channel @xmath73 . according to our definition of @xmath61 , given in the previous section",
    ", we have @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the standard teleportation protocol .",
    "we must stress here that , in general , we do not know whether @xmath76 for some protocol @xmath67 , even if the protocol could _ depend _ on @xmath6 .",
    "( thus we do not know whether the isomorphism implies also the physical equivalence , see previous section ) .",
    "a particular example where it is the case ( depolarizing channel ) will be discussed subsequently ( see subsection c ) .",
    "finally , let us consider the situation with restricted input i.e. if @xmath77 .",
    "then we must work with some established embedding of the space @xmath78 into the bob space @xmath79 ( of course the very form of the embedding is here irrelevant ) so that the formula ( [ fid2 ] ) for fidelity is well defined .",
    "consider the one - parameter family of states @xcite given by @xmath80 we will call them noisy singlets .",
    "they are the most natural generalization of the @xmath81 werner states @xcite .",
    "let us now calculate the two parameters @xmath7 and @xmath56 . to calculate @xmath7 consider the standard teleportation scheme via the state .",
    "the scheme produces fidelity @xmath82 for singlet state . for the completely random noise represented by the state @xmath83 ,",
    "the average final state of bob particle after the teleportation procedure is equal to @xmath26 and does not depend on the unknown state to be teleported .",
    "then , in this case the fidelity amounts to @xmath84 .",
    "thus for the noisy singlet we obtain @xmath85 the parameter @xmath56 amounts to @xmath86 the two parameters are related in the following way @xmath87 we see that the noisy singlet is uniquely determined by any of those parameters ( so one can use notation @xmath88 or @xmath89 if we use one of these parametrizations ) .",
    "the separability of the state @xmath90 can be characterized in a very clear way .",
    "namely it is @xcite separable if and only if @xmath91 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "recall that the noisy singlets are the only states invariant under @xmath4 transformations @xcite ( here the star denotes complex conjugation ) .",
    "any state @xmath6 , if subjected to @xmath4 twirling produces noisy singlet : @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "thus the singlet fraction is invariant under the twirling procedure .      the depolarizing channel @xcite is defined as follows @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the state acting on @xmath98 . from the formula ( [ dep ] ) follows that with probability @xmath99 the channel does not affect the input state , while with probability @xmath100 it completely randomizes the input state .",
    "now if we apply the considered channel to half of singlet we obtain the noisy singlet with the same parameter @xmath99 .",
    "thus we have the equivalence @xmath101 then it follows that @xmath102 .",
    "even more , we have _ full _ physical equivalence between depolarizing channel and noisy singlet : the channel can be reproduced by standard teleportation applied to noisy singlet ( this is compatible with similar observation in ref.@xcite for two - qubit case ) .",
    "thus we have the complete set of equivalences @xmath103 to prove the last equality consider the standard teleportation scheme of an unknown state through the state @xmath90 . as described in the previous subsection , with probability @xmath99 bob",
    "will obtain the input state undisturbed , while with probability @xmath100 he will end up with totally mixed state @xmath104 .",
    "thus any given input state @xmath97 is in the process @xmath105 transformed into the state @xmath106 .",
    "then it follows that also the parameter @xmath7 is the same for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , so that the formulas ( [ f ] ) , ( [ f ] ) hold also for the depolarizing channel , and any of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath7 determines it uniquely .",
    "here we will introduce an operation over the channels which is equivalent to @xmath4 twirling of states .",
    "namely for any channel @xmath18 one can consider a new one constructed in the following way . given the incoming particle , alice subjects it to a random unitary transformation @xmath109 , then",
    "sends it through the channel and informs bob , which unitary was applied .",
    "subsequently , bob , received the particle , applies the inverse transformation @xmath110 .",
    "now , we will show that , as expected , the following lemma is true .",
    "_ lemma 1.- _ any channel @xmath18 subjected to the twirling procedure becomes depolarizing channel with the same @xmath56",
    "i.e. we have @xmath111 with @xmath112 .    _",
    "proof.- _ let us first show that @xmath113 which can be illustrated by means of the following commutative diagram @xmath114 where the arrows @xmath115 denote the isomorphism ( [ map ] ) . that the diagram commutes can be verified directly @xmath116=\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int{\\rm d}\\ , u \\left [ i\\otimes u^\\dagger i\\otimes \\lambda(u^t\\otimes i p_+ u^*\\otimes i)i\\otimes u\\right]=\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int{\\rm d}\\ ,",
    "u \\left [ u^{*\\dagger}\\otimes u^\\dagger ( i\\otimes \\lambda)p_+ u^*\\otimes u\\right]=\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int{\\rm d}\\ , u u^*\\otimes u\\varrho_{\\lambda } u^{*\\dagger}\\otimes u^{\\dagger}= twirl(\\varrho_{\\lambda})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we used the identity @xmath117 @xcite and the invariance of the haar measure under hermitian conjugation .",
    "now , applying the isomorphism ( [ map ] ) we obtain that the channel @xmath118 is equal to the channel corresponding to the state @xmath119 .",
    "since the latter is noisy singlet , then the channel must be depolarizing one .",
    "let us compute entanglement fidelity of @xmath118 @xmath120 where we used definition of @xmath56 , its invariance under twirling states , and the equality ( [ twirl - iso ] ) .",
    "hence the entanglement fidelity is invariant under the twirling of channel .",
    "we have also the following lemma .    _",
    "lemma 2.- _ the channel fidelity @xmath7 is invariant under twirling .",
    "@xmath121    _ proof.- _ this follows from direct calculation of @xmath7 . namely the formula ( [ fid2 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath122 where @xmath60 is an arbitrarily established vector and the integral is performed over the uniform distribution on the group @xmath123 ( proportional to the haar measure ) .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath124 with @xmath125 unitary and @xmath126 representing the integration over haar measure .",
    "these two lemmas produce the following result .    _",
    "proposition 1.- _ for any channel @xmath18 one has @xmath127 _ proof.- _ the above equality is true for depolarizing channel , but as shown above both @xmath7 and @xmath56 are invariants of twirling , so that it must be also true for any channel .      here",
    "we will prove the main result of this section .",
    "namely we will relate the maximal fidelity of general teleportation scheme to the maximal possible fraction of singlet attainable by means of trace - preserving lqcc operations .",
    "this will reduce the problem of optimal teleportation scheme for a given mixed state to the less complicated problem of increasing singlet fraction .    _",
    "theorem.- _ let @xmath1 be the maximal possible fidelity ( overlap with the state @xmath24 ) which can be obtained from a given state @xmath6 by means of trace - preserving lqcc operation .",
    "then the maximal fidelity @xmath0 of teleportation via the state @xmath6 attainable by means of trace - preserving lqcc operations is equal to @xmath128    _ proof.- _ first we will prove that @xmath129 .",
    "suppose we have a teleportation channel of fidelity @xmath0 . from prop . 1",
    "it follows that entanglement fidelity @xmath56 of that channel satisfies @xmath130 .",
    "then sending half of singlet down the channel one produces state with @xmath56 satisfying relation ( [ optimal ] ) and @xmath1 is at least equal to @xmath56 .",
    "conversely , suppose that by trace - preserving lqcc operations a state @xmath71 of maximal @xmath56 has been obtained .",
    "apply twirling to this state .",
    "the resulting state is of the form ( [ ntryplet ] ) .",
    "then the fidelity @xmath7 of standard teleportation via this state satisfies the relation ( [ fntryplet ] ) .",
    "thus the standard teleportation will achieve the required @xmath7 which ends the proof .    _",
    "remark.- _ it can be seen that we can assume that the final singlet is less dimensional than the space @xmath131 .",
    "for example , one can consider maximal attainable fraction @xmath132 of @xmath133 singlet @xmath134 where @xmath135 . in this case , the formula [ optimal ] desribes the optimnal fidelity of teleportation for restricted input ( i.e. if the unknown state comes from the hilbert space of dimension @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "here we will apply the results of the previous section to the question of optimal fidelity of teleportation via bound entangled ( be ) states .",
    "these are the ones which are entangled ( are not mixture of product states ) but can not be distilled @xcite .",
    "linden and popescu asked the question , whether the be states allow for better fidelity than the one of purely classical teleportation ( i.e. the one where alice and bob have no prior entanglement so that the quantum information is sent via classical bits themselves ) . positive answer to the same question but in the context of states allowing local hidden variable model @xcite allowed to obtain nonclassical features of the states @xcite .",
    "now , for a class of be states , those authors obtained negative answer , taking into account more general teleportation scheme than the original one ( they allowed for arbitrary von neumann measurement of alice ) .    here",
    ", we are able to obtain the fully general answer",
    ". namely we will show that _ the optimal fidelity of teleportation via arbitrary be state is equal to the classical teleportation fidelity_.    let us first derive the expression for the classical teleportation fidelity . due to the proved theorem , it suffices to find maximal singlet fraction attainable via classical communication .",
    "this , however , reduces to determining the maximal possible singlet fraction of separable states . of course",
    ", it can not be greater than @xmath137 , since states with @xmath138 are entangled ( even free entangled i.e. distillable  explicit distillation protocol has been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the noisy singlet with @xmath139 is separable .",
    "hence , applying the formula ( [ optimal ] ) we obtain that the best fidelity of teleportation via classical channel is given by @xmath140 .",
    "consider now the be states .",
    "since the states with @xmath138 are free entangled , then the maximal possible @xmath56 for be states is also @xmath139 .",
    "then the maximal fidelity of teleportation via a given be state is also less than or equal to the @xmath141 .",
    "in fact it is equal , as having any be state one can simply get rid of it and perform classical teleportation attaining the fidelity @xmath141 .",
    "here we will consider the problem of conditional increasing of fidelity of teleportation i.e. conclusive teleportation @xcite . by the results of the section [ fidelity - fraction ] this question will be directly related to the problem of conditional increasing of singlet fraction .",
    "suppose that alice and bob has a pair in state for which the optimal teleportation fidelity is @xmath142 .",
    "suppose further , that the fidelity is too poor for some alice and bob purposes .",
    "what they can do to change the situation is to perform the so - called conclusive teleportation .",
    "namely , they can perform some lqcc operation with two final outcomes 0 and 1 .",
    "obtained the outcome 0 they fail and decide to discard the pair . if the outcome is 1 they perform teleportation , and the fidelity is now much better that the initial @xmath142 . of course , the price they must pay is that the probability of the success ( outcome 1 ) may be small .",
    "the scheme is illustrated on the figure 1 .",
    "a simple example is the following .",
    "suppose that alice and bob share a pair in pure state @xmath143 which is nearly product ( i.e. @xmath144 is close to 1 ) .",
    "then the standard teleportation scheme provides a rather poor fidelity @xmath145 @xcite . however , alice can subject her particle to filtering procedure @xcite described by the operation @xmath146 with @xmath147 , @xmath148 . here",
    "the outcome 1 ( success ) correspond to operator @xmath149 .",
    "indeed , if this outcome was obtained , the state collapses to the singlet one @xmath150 then , in this case perfect teleportation can be performed .",
    "thus , if alice and bob teleported directly via the initial state , they would obtain a very poor performance .",
    "now , they have a small , but nonzero chance of performing perfect teleportation .",
    "the main questions concerning the above scheme of conclusive teleportation are the following . which states can provide perfect conclusive teleportation ?",
    "more precisely , given a state @xmath6 , does there exist a nonzero probability @xmath99 of success , for which alice and bob end up with pure singlet ?",
    "confining now to the class of states which can not be converted into pure singlets one could ask : how large fidelity can be obtained ? as we will see , _ the fact that perfect conclusive teleportation is impossible does not , in general , mean that there is some fidelity threshold @xmath151 which can not be exceeded_.    to analyse the above questions , we will apply the tools worked out in previous sections . namely , there we have reduced the problem of optimal fidelity of teleportation to the problem of optimal increasing of singlet fraction .",
    "let us now apply this result to the present situation .",
    "namely for a given probability @xmath99 let @xmath152 denote the maximal fidelity of conclusive teleportation with this probability of success . from the theorem it follows that @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the maximal singlet fraction attainable with probability @xmath99 of success",
    "so to obtain results concerning fidelity of teleportation we do not need to consider conclusive teleportation scheme but the much simpler scheme of conclusive increasing singlet fraction .",
    "the scheme is illustrated on the figure 2 .",
    "again alice and bob , perform some lqcc operation with two outcomes .",
    "the outcome 0 denotes failure , while obtained the other outcome , alice and bob have the final state of higher fraction of singlet than the initial one .",
    "now the question concerning the fidelity of teleportation can be reformulated in the following way .",
    "for which states perfect singlet can be obtained ?",
    "for which states arbitrarily high fraction of singlet can be obtained ?",
    "finally , for which states there is a threshold for singlet fraction which can not be exceeded ?",
    "applying now the known results concerning increasing singlet fraction @xcite we obtain that there is such a treshold for the states of full rank ( i.e. with eigenvalues non - vanishing ) .",
    "however , we will provide the class of states of low rank , which do not allow for perfect conclusive teleportation , but still _ arbitrarily high fidelity _ can be obtained with nonzero probability ( the latter depend on how high fidelity we would like to have ) .",
    "we will also provide a class of states of low rank for which we prove that the threshold exists . as we will see the proof is surprisingly complicated .",
    "then the problem of determining whether a given state has an ultimate threshold for conclusive teleportation becomes highly nontrivial .",
    "the above problems are closely related to the problem of distillation @xcite by means of non - collective operations @xcite .",
    "namely , if for some state it is possible to obtain conclusively perfect singlets , then we have in fact a protocol of distillation , because we obtain a nonzero rate of produced singlets .",
    "then such a state is non - collectively distillable . in the case , where pure singlets can not be produced",
    ", the non - collective operations can not produce nonzero asymptotic yield .",
    "if still an arbitrary high singlet fraction can be obtained , we will call the state non - collectively _ quasi - distillable _ ( as in this paper we deal only with non - collective protocols , so we will say briefly quasi - distillable ) .",
    "the states which have the ultimate threshold of fraction of singlet we call non - quasi - distillable . in subsequent sections",
    "we will define the notions more precisely , and we will consider the relevant examples .",
    "let @xmath156 . as mentioned in introduction ,",
    "following the ideas presented in the papers @xcite , @xcite we use the following definition of noncollective distillation .",
    "_ definition .-",
    "_ one says that the @xmath157 state @xmath6 can be @xmath158 non - collectively distilled iff there exist operators @xmath159 , @xmath36 such that @xmath160    we shall need other notions yet .",
    "_ definitions .- _",
    "( i ) if the state has the schmidt decomposition @xmath161 then we shall call the number @xmath136 _ the schmidt rank of state @xmath12 _ and denote it by @xmath162 .",
    "\\(ii ) we also shall call _ product @xmath163 projection _ the product projection @xmath164 where the ranks of the projections @xmath165 , @xmath166 are @xmath167 , @xmath136 respectively .",
    "hilbert subspace of the space @xmath168 corresponding to any such projection we shall call _ product @xmath163 subspace_.    here we simply characterize the states which can be non - collectively distilled .    _ proposition 2.- _ a given @xmath157 state @xmath6 is @xmath158 non - collectively distillable iff there exists @xmath158 product projection @xmath169 such that @xmath170 is some pure ( possibly unnormalized ) projector of schmidt rank @xmath136 .    _ proof .-",
    "_    consider the given state @xmath6 that is non - collectively distillable .",
    "it means that there exists some @xmath171 such that @xmath172 and @xmath173 is ( possibly unnormalized ) maximally entangled vector of rank @xmath136 .",
    "note , that one can restrict to hermitian @xmath159 , @xmath36 .",
    "it follows from two simple facts : ( i ) for any @xmath159 , @xmath36 there exist @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and unitary @xmath176 , @xmath177 such that @xmath178 , ( ii ) product unitary transformation @xmath179 does not change schmidt rank .",
    "consider now hermitian @xmath159 , @xmath36 satisfying ( [ czysty ] ) .",
    "one can invert them on their supports : @xmath180 , @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183 are projections onto the supports of @xmath159 , @xmath36 . consider a new vector given by @xmath184 . as no product operator can increase the schmidt rank @xcite we have @xmath185 . since @xmath186 , we obtain that , in fact , @xmath187 . also , by definition of @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 one has @xmath192 the projector @xmath193 must have at least rank @xmath194 ( otherwise @xmath195 would have to be less than @xmath136 ) .",
    "if it has grater rank , then one can easily find ( via schmidt decomposition of @xmath196 ) the new projectors @xmath197 of rank @xmath194 that still convert @xmath6 into @xmath198 .",
    "thus , if @xmath193 has rank @xmath158 then we take @xmath199 , @xmath200 , otherwise @xmath201 , @xmath202 .",
    "suppose now , conversely , that there exists @xmath169 of rank @xmath194 such that @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "then @xmath196 is of the form ( [ dec ] ) .",
    "now , taking @xmath205 , @xmath206 , with @xmath207 ( see ( [ dec ] ) ) , one obtains that @xmath208 is maximally entangled state ( of schmidt rank @xmath136 , of course ) .",
    "note that the operator @xmath125 plays the role of the suitable local filter @xcite .",
    "now , applying suitable product uunitary transormation , we obtain ( after normalization ) the desired state @xmath209 .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "note that the above proposition provides the necessary and sufficient condition for noncollective distillation , which obviously does not automatically provide the best way to distill the state . from the proposition",
    "it follows directly that _ no mixed state of @xmath13 system can be converted into the maximally entangled state of the system_.    this is possible however for many states of the system @xmath157 , @xmath210 .",
    "simple examples of such states are the states of the form @xmath211 with reduced density matrix @xmath212 of the matrix @xmath71 orthogonal to the projector @xmath213 .",
    "the corresponding operators @xmath159 , @xmath36 turning such states into maximally entangled state are @xmath42 ( identity operator on the first subsystem ) and @xmath214 .",
    "one can ask whether it is possible by means of lqcc operations to make @xmath215 arbitrary close to 1 with nonzero probability even if the non - collective distillation ( [ nd ] ) is impossible .",
    "in fact one can imagine a sequence of lqcc operations producing better and better @xmath56 but with the probability tending to zero .",
    "then the corresponding denominators of the expression ( [ nd ] ) converge to zero , so that the hypothetical limiting operation does not exist .",
    "it corresponds to the existence of @xmath216 , @xmath217 such that @xmath218 the existence of such the operators we shall call the noncollective _ quasi - distillation _ as we allow corresponding sequence of probabilities @xmath219 to decrease to zero .",
    "it means that if such noncollective operations were performed on many pairs of particles then , unlike in the original distillation scheme @xcite , one would obtain zero yield @xcite of pure singlet states @xmath220 .",
    "now we are in position to present an example of the quasi - distillation process . in this section",
    "we shall focus on the quasi - distillation of the @xmath13 system to the maximally entangled state @xmath221 ( not to @xmath222 with @xmath135 ) . to be specific , we will deal with the case @xmath223 .",
    "the mixed state which can exhibit arbitrary high fidelity @xmath56 after non - collective local filtering is the following : @xmath224 following our remarks from previous section we know that the state , as a mixed one , can not be distilled to the maximally entangled state @xmath225 . according to the formula ( [ optimal ] )",
    "this means that it is impossible to teleport with the fidelity @xmath226 via the state @xmath227 .",
    "however it can be easily seen that the operations : @xmath228 , \\ \\",
    "diag [ 1,\\frac{1}{n},\\frac{1}{n}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] allow for quasi - distillation process ( [ nqd ] ) .",
    "indeed , then @xmath229\\ ] ] which after suitable normalisation leads to the desired result .",
    "the key point is that in the letter example the normalizing factor of the new state converges to zero i.e. we have increasing of the fidelity of the output state but , at the same time , the probability of obtaining this output state decreases to zero .",
    "now , according to ( [ optimal ] ) it means that it is possible to teleport with the fidelity @xmath7 arbitarily close to unity , although the value @xmath226 can not be achieved .",
    "now we shall see how the above situation dramatically change under seemingly not strong modifications of the input state ( [ st1 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "consider the following state @xcite @xmath230 for convenience let us introduce the notation @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 .",
    "the same arguments as before lead to the conclusion that there are no operators @xmath159 , @xmath36 such that @xmath234 .",
    "we will show that for the considered state , unlike for @xmath227 , even the second , weaker form of distillation of entanglement is impossible .",
    "let us assume , on the contrary , that ( [ nqd ] ) is possible .",
    "then the output states can be written as convex combinations of two states , the second one of them being certainly _ separable _",
    "@xmath235 \\frac{\\theta_{n}(p_{+ } ) } { \\langle\\theta_{n}(p_{+})\\rangle } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\left[(1-f)\\frac{\\langle\\theta_{n}(\\sigma_{+})\\rangle } { \\langle\\theta_{n}(\\varrho_{f})\\rangle}\\right ] \\frac{\\theta_{n } ( \\sigma_{+})}{\\langle\\theta_{n}(\\sigma_{+})\\rangle } \\label{limit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath236 ; the weights at both states have been put into squared brackets ( assume , for a while , that for all @xmath167 , we have @xmath237 and @xmath238 ) .",
    "since the limit state must be pure entangled state , the second weight must converge to zero .",
    "otherwise some of its subsequences would converge to the weight @xmath239 ( recall that any bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence ) .",
    "as both the set of states and the set of separable states are compact it would lead to the conclusion that the limit state of the sequence ( [ limit ] ) includes some separable state with the nonzero weight @xmath240 .",
    "such a state certainly could not be the pure entangled one .",
    "thus the weight @xmath241 must converge to zero .",
    "together with the normalization condition it implies immediately that the weight at the state @xmath242 must converge to unity .",
    "hence we have @xmath243 we also obtain that the ratio of the second weight to the first one must vanish in the limit of large @xmath167 .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath244    subsequently , we shall show that satisfaction of the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is impossible if only ( [ cond1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath245{\\langle\\theta_{n}(p_{+})\\rangle } $ ] , @xmath246{\\langle\\theta_{n}(p_{+})\\rangle } $ ] , @xmath247 .",
    "then the requirement ( [ cond2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath248 but , at the same time , calculating that @xmath249 ) we obtain via ( [ cond1 ] ) that @xmath250    vanishing of this limit , which is a product of three positive sequences implies that at least one of them , say @xmath251 , must converge to zero .",
    "but it means , turning back to ( [ cond2 ] ) , that @xmath252 ) requires ) because its schmidt decomposition can consist of at most two terms ( it can be easily seen by looking at the spectrum of the corresponding reduced density matrix ) . in this way we have obtained the required contradiction .",
    "finally , note that if the condition of nonvanishing of @xmath253 and @xmath254 for all @xmath167 is not satisfied , the result is still valid .",
    "indeed , if for all but finite number of components of the sequence @xmath253 vanish , then the limit state is separable ( hence certainly can not be quasi distilled ) .",
    "if the same holds for the sequence @xmath254 , then the state ( [ limit ] ) consits only of the first term and the proof still applies ( the limits containing @xmath254 can be replaced by zeros ) . if none of the above conditions is fulfilled , one can take a subsequence @xmath255 and @xmath256 with all components nonvanishing and apply the proof to the subsequence .",
    "thus we have proved that for the considered state the process ( [ nqd ] ) is impossible .",
    "in other words no lqcc operations performed on the ( [ st2 ] ) state can increase the fidelity @xmath257 upon some @xmath151 . following the results of section [ fidelity - fraction ]",
    "it means that the conclusive teleportation of the spin-1 state through the state @xmath258 can produce the fidelity of transmission at most equal to @xmath259 .",
    "we have developed the correspondence between states and channels .",
    "in particular we have exploited the equivalence between @xmath260 invariant states and the generalized depolarizing channel to provide a relation between the optimal fidelity of teleportation and the maximal attainable singlet fraction .",
    "if the maximal fraction @xmath56 of singlet obtained from the initial two spin - s state @xmath6 by means of trace - preserving lqcc operations is equal to @xmath1 then the best possible transmission fidelity @xmath7 of teleportation via state @xmath6 is @xmath261 .",
    "this result was applied to the case of conclusive teleportation .",
    "it gives the answer to the question announced at the beginning of this paper .",
    "namely , if alice wants to teleport only if she knows that the transfer fidelity is better than @xmath262 then the state _ must _ admit an lqcc operation converting it ( possibly with some probability ) into the state with singlet fraction greater than @xmath263 .",
    "it is interesting that the result does not depend on the kind of teleportation scheme and at the same time it involves an quantity @xmath56 which measures the degree of overlap of the channel state with the singlet state .",
    "the quantity was originally associated with the standard teleportation scheme @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this scheme alice performs her complete measurement ( required as a step of the scheme ) in maximally entangled basis .",
    "it suggests that the standard teleportation scheme might be optimal .",
    "as the concept of conclusive teleportation with good fidelity appeared to be connected with the possibility of increasing of the fidelity @xmath56 , we have considered the problem of noncollective distillation of the mixed state of two component system .",
    "it involves a conversion ( by means of noncollective lqcc operations ) of some @xmath264 ( @xmath265 ) channel state into the maximally entangled state @xmath225 or its @xmath158 counterparts ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "we have shown that the first kind of conversion is suppressed for mixed states ( this generalizes the result for @xmath266 singlets @xcite ) .",
    "thus there is an important difference between @xmath13 mixed and pure states as there are some pure states which can be converted in such a way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the states for which the second kind of conversion is possible have been characterized and the possibility of conversion of some @xmath267 ( @xmath268 ) states into the singlet state has been pointed out .",
    "then we have introduced the concept of quasi - distillation which means , by definition , the possibility of making via lqcc process the quantity @xmath56 arbitrary close to unity with nonzero probability but with the latter allowed to depend on the desired @xmath56 of output state .",
    "we focused on the _ noncollective _ quasi - distillation which is the possibility of making the fidelity @xmath56 of the state arbitrary close to unity in _ noncollective lqcc process_. it turned out that sometimes despite that a state can not be non - collectively distilled it allows for noncollective quasi - distillation .",
    "the key point is that the probability of achieving of the required fidelity is the less the higher the fidelity is .",
    "the examples of states which are quasi - distillable but not distillable via noncollective processes have been provided .",
    "they show that impossiblity of perfect tleleportation sometimes does not implies the treshold for fidelity of the conclusive teleportation i.e. sometimes it is still possible to teleport with @xmath7 arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "subsequently some modifications of those states have been considered that do not fall into the classes considered so far in refs.@xcite and for which the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be applied due to low rank of the matrix of the state .",
    "nevertheless we have shown by different technique that those states are not even quasi - distillable @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the conclusion that , in the noncollective lqcc operations regime , any state which can not be quasi - distilled _ never _ allow for conclusive teleportation with the fidelity better than some boundary value @xmath0 .",
    "this result has been achieved by means of general approach including _ all _ possible teleportation schemes .",
    "it was possible due to the application of the isomorphism between states and channels which seems to be promising technique in quantum information theory .",
