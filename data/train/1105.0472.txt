    "white dwarf asteroseismology offers the opportunity of directly constraining mass , core composition , envelope composition and stratification , spin rate , and magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "the zz  ceti h - atmosphere white dwarfs ( wds ) pulsate in normal modes of oscillation ( @xmath5-modes ) where buoyancy is the restoring force @xcite .",
    "these stars exhibit pulsations when they enter the instability region , a discrete strip in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane that spans 11,000 @xmath8 12,250k at @xmath9 .",
    "this strip has been extensively observed and constrained by numerous sources @xcite and is likely pure ; i.e. , all cooling wds pulsate as they evolve through the instability strip .",
    "these data offer insight into the evolution of wds @xcite .",
    "the lowest mass wd known to pulsate is he  0031 - 5525 at @xmath10 and @xmath11k and a mass of @xmath120.5@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the known zz  ceti pulsators are certainly c / o - core wds , where the theoretical understanding has been focused @xcite .    starting with @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "there has been a growing realization that many wds have @xmath14 , implying core masses lower than expected for c / o - core wds .",
    "these are expected to be he wds made from the truncated red giant branch ( rgb ) evolution of @xmath15@xmath13 stars @xcite . to form a he wd",
    ", a process removes mass from the h envelope , quenching the h - shell burning that grows the he core to ignition .",
    "two modes of evolution have been proposed to truncate rgb evolution : mass loss due to binary interaction and mass loss due to stellar winds .",
    "as a progenitor star ascends the rgb , its radius increases rapidly , eventually filling the roche lobe , and mass transfer begins . if unstable , this mass transfer initiates a common envelope event @xcite ejecting the envelope from the red giant as the he - core and companion spiral into shorter orbital periods @xcite .",
    "it is this physics that leads to the expectation that he wds should be in binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , surveys have uncovered significant numbers of he wds that do not appear to be in binary systems @xcite . in stars of high metallicity , the increased opacity in the envelope due to metals can drive very strong stellar winds that cause mass loss in excess of 0.5@xmath13 during the rgb phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that high metallicity stars may lose enough mass on the rgb due to stellar winds to avoid he core ignition and thus leave @xmath16@xmath13 he wds as remnants .",
    "direct evidence for this scenario is scarce , but may exist in the over - luminous low mass he wds in the globular cluster ngc  6791 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that this wind mass loss scenario can not produce low mass he wds .",
    "once formed , he wd evolution is different from that of c / o wds because nuclear burning may still play a significant role , especially when @xmath17@xmath13 .",
    "studies of millisecond pulsars suggest that many he wds are born with thick @xmath1810@xmath1910@xmath20 h envelopes @xcite .",
    "these thick h envelopes develop long diffusive tails into the he core where the higher densities and temperatures can cause them to ignite @xcite .",
    "this ignition highlights a dichotomy in the evolution of he wds . for he",
    "wds of @xmath210.180.20@xmath13 ( dependent upon metallicity ) the h envelopes are radially thin enough that thin - shell instabilities develop and a series of rapid thermonuclear flashes occur .",
    "these flashes burn away the envelope leaving only a thin layer of h which allows for rapid cooling on timescales of 10100s of myrs . for he",
    "wds of @xmath220.180.20@xmath13 , the nuclear burning is stable and provides a dominant energy source that slows the cooling evolution of the wd to timescales of several gyrs @xcite . from an observational standpoint , very low mass he wds ( @xmath230.2@xmath13 ) may spend significantly more time in a zz  ceti like instability strip than the higher mass he wds . however , no systematic search for their pulsations has been undertaken .",
    "this is the goal of our work .    some differences from the c / o - core zz  ceti stars are expected .",
    "@xcite used very low mass he wd models ( @xmath230.2@xmath13 ) with stable h burning envelopes and the brickhill convective driving criterion @xcite to locate he wd pulsation candidates .",
    "the result of this work is seen in the ",
    "blue \" edge boundary depicted between @xmath246.06.5 in figure [ fig : obscand ] . clearly , many theoretical issues remain in pinpointing the precise location of the blue edge , such as the effects of convective efficiency and the use of more detailed fully non - adiabatic calculations , which may move this boundary by several hundred kelvin @xcite . for normal mass",
    "he wds ( 0.20.45@xmath13 ) , the blue edge of the instability strip has not been theoretically determined ( though , see @xcite from some preliminary calculations ) and so we naively extrapolate the empirical boundary of the zz  ceti stars as determined by @xcite and connect it to the very low mass he wd boundary . given the many theoretical uncertainties and naive extrapolations , the boundary depicted in figure [ fig : obscand ] is meant only to highlight the parameter space in which to carry out our search .    in this paper",

    "we performed differential photometry using multiple comparison stars inversely weighted to their intrinsic variance over a single run of observation ( a technique similar to that used in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we ensure all comparison stars are non - variable by comparing each prospective star within the field - of - view with all others in every combination and use periodograms to ensure no periodic trends are present .",
    "we employ a variable aperture algorithm to optimize the signal - to - noise of our photometry in order to deal with the varying psf . for each observation ,",
    "a single representative frame was selected . for every star in the image we varied the size of the photometric aperture to find that size which optimized the signal - to - noise of the measurement .",
    "the optimum apertures were then scaled by the average fwhm of 2d - gaussians fitted to each star .",
    "for all other images the average fwhm of the stellar psfs was measured and then scaled using the appropriate optimum scaling .",
    "therefore , as the seeing fluctuates during an observation the apertures are adjusted larger or smaller ( a technique similar to that used in @xcite ) .",
    "once we have constructed the light curve for our target star there are often long timescale trends still present in the data , usually caused by the color - airmass effect .",
    "we correct for this effect by correlating our light curve with airmass and dividing a fitted trend from the light curve . for some observations",
    "this trend removal is insufficient as other systematics may be present ( e.g. variable sky background due to the moon ) .",
    "in these cases low order polynomials ( third order or less ) are used to remove this power .      to detect pulsations in our light curve",

    "low amplitude pulsations show pulse shapes that are closely approximated by sinusoids while high amplitude pulsations frequently show narrow peaks in their shape @xcite .",
    "we feel this justifies our use of a periodogram which is optimized for sinusoidal signals because the pulsations that are  in the noise \" are closely represented by sinusoids .",
    "high amplitude pulsations , though non - sinusoidal , should still be easily detected as they will likely be well above the noise .",
    "we have not found any significant pulsations from he wds . however , detection limits are still useful in both deciding if additional observations are required and constraining theory .",
    "we measure our detection limits by using signal injection and the properties of a lomb - scargle periodogram . for a periodogram normalized by the variance of the total light curve ,",
    "a false - alarm probability is naturally generated that states for @xmath54 independent frequency bins the probability that independent and normal noise produces power greater than @xmath55 in any of the frequency bins is @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "thus , a signal may be considered 90% significant if it has a false - alarm probability of 10% .",
    "however , our noise may not be precisely normal and independent due to potential unresolved pulsations and other systematic effects ( such as atmospheric correlated noise ) that may cause our data to be slightly correlated .",
    "this may cause us to slightly overestimate our detection limits .",
    "our simulations of normal random data distributed with the same errors as our light curves have shown , however , that this effect is minimal .",
    "we thus determine our detection limits by injecting sinusoidal signals , integrated over the observation s exposure times , at a single frequency and test all phases .",
    "we then increase the amplitude of the signal until 90% of all phases produce a peak in the periodogram at the injected frequency that is 90% significant .",
    "finally , all frequencies accessible by the data are tested with this method . a low frequency limit to the accessible frequencies is derived by testing the low frequency content of the comparison stars where we do _ not _ correct for color - airmass or other long period trends .",
    "we report the low frequency limit as the highest frequency where the red - noise power drops below the 50% false - alarm probability level .",
    "all frequencies below this limit will be affected by the color - airmass and long period trend corrections and are thus not reliable .",
    "for all observations , this low frequency limit is a few times larger than the sampling limit of the inverse of the observation length . in all cases in this paper ,",
    "the detection limits were largely independent of frequency allowing us to state one detection limit over a range of frequencies .",

    "* psr  j1911 - 5958a * was observed one time using the hst / wfc3 setup over 4 orbits .",
    "the photometric analysis for this object was uniquely different than all other objects . due to crowding in the field ( psr  j1911 - 5958a is in a globular cluster ) as well as the unique psf of hst ,",
    "aperture photometry is not the most precise method .",
    "psf - fitting photometry is ideal since the psf of the wfc3 instrument is well understood ( jay anderson , private communication ) .",
    "we used the psf - fitting software developed by jay anderson ( similar to @xcite ) to extract the photometry from our data . since most atmospheric and sky effects are nonexistent in space , variable aperture photometry was not required or used .",
    "we used 36 comparison stars with magnitudes between 17.525.0 to ensure the quality of our photometry . due to a stray light artifact ,",
    "our background was increased by @xmath1230% .",
    "no pulsations were detected to a limit of 16mmags over the frequency range of 0.05 - 3.25mhz .",
    "this object has a measured @xmath89 and @xmath90k with a derived model mass of 0.18@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "of the 12 objects we observed in this paper , seven are likely very low mass ( @xmath230.2@xmath13 ) he wds . whether or not these observations offer strong constraints on theory",
    "is currently an open matter .",
    "first we must consider the accuracy of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 measurements that place these objects within the predicted pulsation parameter space .",
    "unfortunately , very low mass wd atmospheres are not well understood . due to their low surface temperatures ( @xmath91,000k ) ,",
    "the h atmospheres are not sufficiently ionized and neutral broadening of the h absorption lines plays an important role .",
    "the theory of neutral broadening is not well understood and may account for significant errors in line widths ( @xcite ; private communication , detlev koester ) .",
    "as such , the reported errors on @xmath7 and @xmath6 for these objects are always the statistical error of the fit to theoretical atmosphere grids and do not take into account the uncertainties of the theory itself which can increase the uncertainty by as much as a factor of two or more ( private communication , detlev koester ) .",
    "further , the uncertainty of the atmosphere theory is likely not random but rather a shift in a specific direction in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane , affecting the parameter space location of all very low mass he wds .",
    "this is why nltt  11748 is such an important eclipsing binary system @xcite . as a potential double - lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary , it could offer high precision _ model independent _ determinations of both the mass and radius of the he wd component providing a high precision constraint on its gravity for which any atmospheric gravity measurement must match .    of added concern is the location of the instability strip  blue \" edge itself .",
    "@xcite derived the  blue \" edge to be where pulsation modes of eigenvalues @xmath92 and @xmath93 were driven .",
    "this offers a temperature upper limit to the @xmath92 instability strip because the  blue \" edge shifts redward when higher radial orders of @xmath94 are considered . in the few cases where",
    "pulsation mode eigenvalues have been identified observationally ( e.g. hl  tau  76 , @xcite ; g117-b15a and r548 , @xcite ) the highest amplitude observed modes range in @xmath94 from 1 to several 10s . if very low mass he wds preferentially only excite the higher radial order modes , then the blue edge could shift redward by a few 100k potentially removing our three best candidates from the potential instability region",
    ". uncertainties in the precise convective efficiency and the lack of a detailed non - adiabatic analysis could further shift this blue edge by another several 100k in either direction @xcite .",
    "an additional observational concern is whether our detection limits are truly meaningful . only nltt  11748 , lp  400 - 20 , sdss  j0822 + 2743 , and sdss  j1435 +",
    "3733 met our fiducial pulsation limit of 10mmags and only nltt  11748 , sdss  j1435 + 3733 , and sdss  j2240 - 0935 were observed more than once .",
    "it is well known that pulsation amplitudes can be small , 34mmag , and vary in detectability from one night to the next @xcite .",
    "therefore additional observations are required for many of our objects to both tighten their detection limits and gain multiple epochs of observation so that these null detections can be even more convincing .    finally , the theoretical analysis by @xcite involved only an extension of the brickhill convective driving criterion using adiabatic assumptions which may not be valid at the lower gravities of the very low mass he wds .",
    "further , very little theoretical work has been done between 0.2 - 0.45@xmath13 @xcite . to address these concerns , an extension of the non - adiabatic driving work by @xcite and @xcite",
    "should be used to firmly predict the location of the he wd instability strip .",
