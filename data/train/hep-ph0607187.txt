    "one of the great successes of dirac theory is the prediction of the magnetic moment of the electron . usually this is written in terms of the gyromagnetic ratio or g - factor , which is defined via the relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the magnetic moment of a particle of mass @xmath7 , charge @xmath8 , and spin @xmath9 .",
    "then for spin 1/2 the simple dirac theory makes the prediction @xmath4 , which is the value found experimentally ( except for very small corrections from photon loop effects ) for the electron , as well as for its standard model partners @xmath10 and @xmath11@xcite .",
    "feynman argued that the value @xmath4 could be generated in an intuitive fashion by generalizing the schrdinger equation for a spin 0 system of mass @xmath7 and charge @xmath8 interacting with an external vector potential @xmath12 @xmath13 to the form @xmath14 in the case of spin 1/2@xcite . using the pauli matrix identity @xmath15 the spin 1/2 schrdinger equation can be written in the alternative form @xmath16 wherein the hamiltonian is that of the simple spinless system accompanied by a magnetic moment interaction with g=2 .    of course , for charged spin 1/2 systems other than the @xmath17 , _",
    "e.g. _ , the proton or neutron , there exist large deviations from the dirac value@xmath18 on account of loop effects associated with the strong interactions@xcite . however , these are not fundamental systems , but rather are bound states of constituent quarks .",
    "it is then an interesting question to ask whether there is a corresponding `` natural '' value for the g - factor of fundamental systems having spin other than 1/2 .",
    "one answer to this question was given long ago by belinfante , who evaluated the magnetic moment of a simple spin 3/2 system and observed that the g - factor was 2/3 .",
    "combining this with known results for dirac ( spin 1/2 ) and proca ( spin 1 ) systems for which the g - factors are 2 and 1 respectively , belinfante proposed that for a system of spin @xmath0 , @xmath19@xcite , and this has become known as the belinfante conjecture .",
    "this result was proven for arbitrary spin by case and others nearly five decades ago@xcite and more recently by hagen and hurley@xcite and is based on the assumption that the interaction of the spinning system with the electromagnetic field is generated by the simple `` minimal substitution''@xcite @xmath20 that is known from classical electrodynamics to generate the interactions of a charged particle with an external vector potential@xcite . however , in order to check belinfante s proposal , we are limited by the fact that the only other manifestations of charged particles which do not interact strongly are the @xmath21 bosons , which have unit spin and therefore would be expected to have @xmath22 . in the tree level standard model , however , the charged w - boson is found to have @xmath23 , due to the requirement that it is also a gauge boson for the electroweak interaction@xcite .",
    "below we shall show how this feature comes about and will argue that in fact the `` natural '' value for the g - factor of a fundamental system of spin @xmath0 is @xmath24_independent of @xmath0!_. this is not a new suggestion , and rather has been reached by a number of authors in recent years . in particular the work of ferrara , porrati , and telegdi shows that compton scattering from targets of mass @xmath7 and arbitrary spin violates unitarity at photon energy @xmath25 unless @xmath24@xcite , while for those readers looking for a broad and very interesting historical summary as well as some of the constraints posed by general relativity , the article by pfister and king is required reading@xcite .",
    "we shall give below a more limited set of arguments , which , however , we believe are more than enough to buttress the case .    in the next section",
    "then we review how the g - factor can be identified in a given relativistic lagrangian , using the cases of spin 1/2 and spin 1 as examples .",
    "( an alternative approach , based on a nonrelativistic reduction , is presented in the appendix . ) in section 3 we demonstrate why the charged w - boson has a g - factor which differs from that suggested by belinfante and cite specific arguments why one might expect the prediction @xmath4 to be generally valid for systems of arbitrary spin .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in a brief concluding section .",
    "in order to motivate the belinfante conjecture , we need to see how to extract the g - factor from a given relativistic lagrangian .",
    "this can be done in a number of ways .",
    "a standard method is to use a nonrelativistic reduction , as demonstrated in the appendix .",
    "however , one can also identify the g - factor directly by isolating the magnetic interaction in the lagrangian , as we show here .",
    "we begin by reviewing how the dirac value@xmath4arises for spin 1/2 .",
    "the well - known dirac lagrangian for a free spin 1/2 particle is @xmath26 making the minimal substitution  eq .",
    "[ eq : ms]this becomes for the case of a charged system @xmath27 and we can identify the interaction lagrangian by picking out the piece of the lagrangian proportional to @xmath28 @xmath29 by use of the free dirac equation for the fields @xmath30 eq . [ eq : in ] can be rewritten as @xmath31\\ ] ] then using the matrix identity @xmath32 the interaction lagrangian may be written in the so - called gordon form as@xcite @xmath33 where we have defined @xmath34 the first component of eq .",
    "[ eq : co ] is a convective term which is not of interest to our present focus .",
    "rather we examine the second term , which involves the total derivative , and observe that it can be rewritten in the form @xmath35 where we have integrated by parts and used the fact that @xmath36 is antisymmetric in the indices @xmath37 . finally , noting that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the spin operator",
    ", we isolate the magnetic interaction @xmath41 and read off the well - known result @xmath4 .",
    "of course , this prediction is not expected to be exact . in the case of the electron ,",
    "photon loops make small @xmath42 corrections , while , in the case of the proton , strong interaction corrections yield large modifications of @xmath43 .",
    "such corrections , usually called the `` anomalous '' magnetic moment@xmath44can be accounted for phenomenologically by inclusion of a so - called pauli term in the dirac equation@xcite @xmath45    as mentioned above , it has been proven rigorously that , for arbitrary spin , inclusion of the electromagnetic interaction by the minimal substitution yields the `` natural '' value for the magnetic moment given by the belinfante conjecture@xcite .",
    "the proofs are rather formal , and we eschew the temptation to reproduce them here .",
    "rather we shall examine only the case of unit spin , in order to demonstrate how higher spins are handled .",
    "this is an important case , however , because there exists a fundamental charged particle that is analogous to the electron in that it does not participate in the strong interactions and therefore may be expected to carry its `` natural '' value of the magnetic moment .",
    "this is the charged w - boson , which is the carrier of the weak interaction , and can be used to check of these ideas . before discussing the @xmath21 , however , we demonstrate how the minimal prediction for a spin one magnetic moment comes about .",
    "the lagrangian which describes a free neutral spin one system is that given by proca@xcite @xmath46 b^\\beta(x)\\ ] ] and in the case of a spin 1 particle which is charged , we can introduce the electromagnetic interaction as before by making the minimal substitution @xmath47b^\\beta(x)\\ ] ] we isolate the single photon piece of the interaction lagrangian @xmath48b^\\beta(x)-\\eta_{\\alpha\\mu}(\\nabla_\\beta b^{\\alpha\\dagger}(x))b^\\beta(x)\\ ] ] which , as before , can be rewritten as a linear combination of total derivative and @xmath49 pieces as @xmath50b^\\beta(x)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { ie\\over 2}(\\eta_{\\mu\\beta}\\nabla_\\alpha-\\eta_{\\mu\\beta}\\nabla_\\alpha)(b^{\\alpha\\dagger}(x)b^\\beta(x))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting the convective component , we focus on the total derivative term , which , integrating by parts , assumes the form @xmath51 defining matrix elements of the spin operator via@xcite @xmath52 the interaction lagrangian becomes @xmath53 finally , dividing by the factor 2 m , which accounts for the normalization of the unit spin states , we find the belinfante result for the g - factor@xmath54",
    ".      as discussed above , the electron magnetic moment agrees with its `` natural '' value given by the belinfante conjecture up to small terms due to photon loop corrections , but how about the charged w - boson , which is the unit - spin analog of the electron in that there can be no strong interaction corrections ? from eq .",
    "[ eq : be ] , we would expect a g - factor having the value unity , but in the tree level standard model the correct number is predicted to be twice this value , and this prediction is confirmed experimentally@xmath55@xcite .",
    "what is going on , and why is such a large shift to be expected ?",
    "the answer can be found in the simple lagrangian which describes the charged w and the requirement that it be a yang - mills field_i.e .",
    "_ , that the electroweak interaction is a gauge theory@xcite .",
    "this means that the spin one lagrangian which contains the charged - w has the proca form @xmath56 but the su(2 ) field tensor @xmath57 contains an additional term on account of the required gauge invariance@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the su(2 ) electroweak coupling constant .",
    "this `` extra '' term in the field tensor is responsible for the interactions involving three and four w - bosons . for our purpose , however , we pick out only the term involving a pair of charged w - bosons @xmath60 where here the field tensors involving the w - boson are of the simple form @xmath61 we see that there appears to be an additional triple - w coupling . however , this is illusory . in the standard model",
    "there is no neutral w - boson .",
    "rather the field @xmath62 is a linear combination of the photon and neutral @xmath63-boson fields , @xmath64 with the weinberg angle @xmath65 determining the mixing@xcite . since the combination @xmath66 is equal to the electric charge @xmath8 , the ww lagrangian in eq .",

    "[ eq : sm ] , increases the predicted g - factor from its belinfante value@xmath69to its standard model value@xmath70 .",
    "in the previous section we have noted two very different results concerning a `` natural '' value of the g - factor . in the first ,",
    "the simple minimal substitution was shown to agree with the belinfante conjecture@xmath1while in the second an `` extra '' term required by gauge invariance gave the result @xmath4 for the spin 1 @xmath21 gauge boson and agrees with the proposal that the `` natural '' value should @xmath24 , independent of spin .",
    "these predictions coincide in the case of spin 1/2 , but differ for higher spin .",
    "so far , we have dealt only with the case of spin 1/2 and spin one , and we need additional input in order to deal with higher spin .",
    "it would be nice to be able to use experiment to decide the case , but this is not possible for there exist only two cases of charged particles which do not participate in the strong interactions  the electron ( or its partners the muon or tau ) and the w - boson .",
    "thus extension of our ideas beyond spin one requires theoretical input .",
    "below we discuss in turn at least three such theoretical reasons which suggest that the correct answer is @xmath24 .",
    "the first argument comes from study of compton scattering from a spin-@xmath0 target at high energy@xcite , @xcite .",

    "they arise from the born diagrams via the @xmath76 piece of the spin - one propagator @xmath77 and reveal that if we take the limit as the charge stays fixed and the mass becomes small the compton amplitude will diverge , violating unitarity at a photon energy @xmath78 _ unless the gyromagnetic ratio has the value @xmath4 !",
    "_ remarkably , the condition @xmath4 has been demonstrated by ferrara , porrati , and telegdi to assure the absence of @xmath75 terms _ for arbitrary spin_@xcite , which is certainly suggestive that the `` natural '' value of the g - factor should be @xmath24 .",
    "the gerasimov , drell , hearn sum rule relates the anomalous magnetic moment of a system of spin @xmath0 to a weighted integral over polarized photon cross sections .",
    "it was originally derived for the nucleon and has the form @xmath79 where here @xmath44 is the anomalous magnetic moment , while @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the laboratory frame scattering cross sections involving a polarized nucleon target and circularly polarized photons whose helicity is parallel , antiparallel to the target spin . it is derived simply by assuming analyticity of the compton amplitude together with crossing symmetry and convergence and is a very fundamental sum rule about which much has been written@xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies have shown that it is satisfied in the case of a nucleon target@xcite.the gdh sum rule is also closely connected to the celebrated bjorken sum rule@xcite @xmath82 which relates the difference of polarized proton and neutron inclusive electron scattering structure functions to the axial decay constant of the neutron . for these reasons the gdh sum rule can be considered to be very fundamental and generally valid for arbitrary targets even though it has been experimentally verified only for the nucleon .",

    "if as in the nucleon case , we define what is measured here as the _ anomalous magnetic moment _ , then we see that this anomalous moment is defined in terms of the difference of the experimental g - factor from a bare value@xmath84again supporting the suggestion that the `` natural '' value of the g - factor should be @xmath24 , independent of spin .      using powerful ( string - based ) techniques , which simplify conventional quantum field theory calculations , it has recently been demonstrated that the elastic scattering of gravitons from a target of arbitrary spin must factorize@xcite , a feature that had been noted ten years previously by choi et al . based on gauge theory arguments@xcite .",
    "that is , a ( in harmonic gauge ) graviton is a particle of spin 2 whose polarization vector @xmath85 can be written as a simple product of the corresponding spin one photon polarization vectors @xmath86 the elastic scattering of gravitons from a target of arbitrary spin is constructed from the four diagrams shown in figure 2 , consisting of two born diagrams , a seagull term , and the graviton pole diagram .",
    "the factorization theorem asserts that for scattering from a target of spin @xmath0 , the graviton scattering amplitude can be written in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the elastic graviton scattering amplitude , @xmath89 is the elastic compton amplitude from a target of spin @xmath0 , and f is the kinematic factor @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 being the fine structure and newton constants respectively .",
    "the full graviton scattering amplitude could in principle have terms proportional to @xmath75 from the born diagrams and the propagator of the spin-@xmath0 system .",
    "however , _ this does not occur_. this can be seen in the case of a spin one system from the form of the half - off - shell energy - momentum tensor , which determines the gravitational coupling @xmath93 taking @xmath94 to be physical@xmath95but @xmath96 to be an off - shell intermediate state momentum , we find that when @xmath97 is contracted with the @xmath75 piece of the spin one propagator@xmath98the result is _ independent _ of @xmath99 @xmath100 the coefficient @xmath75 in the spin one propagator has cancelled .",
    "thus no term proportional to @xmath75 survives in the born amplitude and this vanishing of terms which diverge as @xmath101 can be shown to be a general property regardless of the spin of the target .",
    "according to the factorization condition , the vanishing of @xmath75 terms in the gravitational amplitude can only result from the vanishing of such terms in the corresponding compton amplitude , which we have already seen occurs _ only _ if the value @xmath24 is chosen , so from an additional standpoint we see that the `` natural '' value for the g - factor is @xmath4 .",
    "above we have examined the question of whether there exists a `` natural '' value for the gyromagnetic ratio of a fundamental particle of spin @xmath0 .",
    "one might think that this question was answered long ago when belinfante conjectured and others proved the assertion that when minimal substitution is used in order to generate the electromagnetic interactions os a system of spin @xmath0 , the resulting g - factor is given by @xmath102 however , while this prediction is consistent with the case of the electron , we showed that in the standard model of electroweak interactions the only other example of a charged fundamental particle ",
    "the @xmath21 boson  does not agree with this prediction .",
    "rather , due to gauge invariance , the result @xmath103 is found .",
    "we then went on to argue that , while there are no additional experimental cases , the `` natural '' value @xmath4 for all systems is supported by at least three theoretical arguments :    * use of @xmath24 guarantees the vanishing of terms proportional to @xmath75 in the compton scattering amplitude from a system of spin @xmath0 , whose presence would violate unitarity at the very low energy scale @xmath104 .",
    "* the fundamental gdh sum rule allows experimental measurement of the _ anomalous _ magnetic moment for a system of arbitrary spin @xmath0 , where the anomalous moment is @xmath105 with @xmath24 being the `` natural '' value of the g - factor .",
    "* based on the result that the graviton scattering amplitude from a system of spin - s must factorize into a product of compton amplitudes , the vanishing of @xmath75 terms in the graviton amplitude is found to result from the choice @xmath24 in the corresponding compton amplitude .",
    "although for simplicity we shall not discuss them here there exist even more reasons for this assertion@xcite,@xcite .    *",
    "the only known example of a completely consistent theory of interacting particles of spin greater than two is string theory , and for open strings it is possible to obtain the exact equations of motion for massive charged particles of arbitrary spin , moving in a constant , external electromagnetic background .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath24 for all spins@xcite . * the classical relativistic equation of motion of the polarization vector @xmath106 in a homogeneous external electromagnetic field is given by the bargmann , michel , telegdi or bmt equation@xcite @xmath107 which simplifies for @xmath24 independent of the spin of the particle .",
    "* in general relativity the @xmath108 limit of the kerr - newman metric describing spacetime around a charged spinning mass results in an electromagnetic field in flat space with @xmath4 . additional arguments from general relativity can be found in @xcite .    for these and other reasons",
    "then , it appears that the `` natural '' value for the g - factor is @xmath24 regardless of spin .",
    "since there are no experimental manifestations of this result outside of the electron and @xmath21-boson systems , this discussion could be argued to be somewhat metaphysical , but the totality of the arguments given above together with the standard model value of the @xmath21 moment would seem to constitute a rather compelling case .",
