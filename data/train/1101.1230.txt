    "geometrical frustration and quantum fluctuation provide a promising route to unconventional states in magnetism , including various types of spin liquids characterized by the absence or emergence of unconventional orders of chirality or multipoles in three spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice structure offers a prototypical stage where the geometrical frustration prevents the magnetic dipole long - range order ( lro )  @xcite .",
    "one class of magnetic pyrochlore oxides  @xcite which have been most intensively studied is a dipolar spin ice , e.g. , dy@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2 and ho@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum variants of the spin ice have attracted great interest  @xcite , which include tb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , tb@xmath6sn@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , and pr@xmath6sn@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , pr@xmath6ir@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , yb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , and er@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite .    in the dipolar spin ice ,",
    "large @xmath7 ising magnetic moments ( @xmath8 ) of dy@xmath9 and ho@xmath9 ions , each of which points either inwards ( `` in '' ) to or outwards ( `` out '' ) from the center of the tetrahedron , interact with each other mainly through the magnetic dipole interaction  @xcite .",
    "this gives a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor coupling , forming the `` 2-in , 2-out '' ice rule  @xcite and leaving macroscopically degenerate ground states because of geometrical frustration .",
    "the spin dynamics is quite slow and the quantum effects are almost negligible .",
    "recently , quantum effects have been observed with inelastic neutron - scattering experiments on the spin - ice related compounds , tb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , tb@xmath6sn@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , and pr@xmath6sn@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "pr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = zr , sn , and ir ) shows no magnetic dipole lro but a ( partial ) spin freezing at @xmath10-@xmath11 k  @xcite .",
    "pr@xmath6ir@xmath6o@xmath2 shows a metamagnetic transition at low temperatures only when the magnetic field is applied in the [ 111 ] direction  @xcite , as in the spin ice .",
    "a chiral spin liquid  @xcite has been detected through the anomalous hall effect  @xcite at zero magnetic field without magnetic dipole lro in pr@xmath6ir@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "unlike the dipolar spin ice , the curie - weiss temperature @xmath12 is antiferromagnetic for the zirconate  @xcite and iridate  @xcite .",
    "the stannate shows a significant level of low - energy short - range spin dynamics in the energy range up to a few kelvin  @xcite , which is absent in the classical spin ice .",
    "vital roles of the planar components have also been experimentally observed in yb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2 and er@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "obviously , quantum fluctuations enrich the otherwise classical properties of the spin ice .",
    "the mechanism in which the quantum fluctuations indicated by these observations appear depend on the rare - earth ions , including the difference in kramers and non - kramers ions .",
    "a relatively small localized magnetic moment reduces the magnetic dipole interaction , allowing for an important role of the superexchange interaction , as in the case of pr@xmath9 ions  @xcite and also expected for nd@xmath9 , sm@xmath9 , and yb@xmath9 ions because of their small moment amplitudes , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively , for isolated cases . in the case of tb@xmath9 ions , the presence of low - energy crystalline electric field levels also plays a role  @xcite . remarkably , the large @xmath4 coupling and the crystalline electric field for localized @xmath16 electrons makes the superexchange interaction highly anisotropic  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the strength of the anisotropy depends on the properties of local magnetic doublets of rare - earth ions , producing the variety of experimentally observed low - temperature magnetic properties which are mentioned above .",
    "theoretically , it is expected that this anisotropic superexchange interaction drives _ quantum phase transitions among the spin ice , quadrupolar states having nontrivial chirality correlations , and the quantum spin ice _ for non - kramers magentic doublets .    as for kramers doublets , on the other hand , understandings of yb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2 are rather controversial .",
    "yb localized @xmath16 magnetic moments are believed to almost lie perpendicular to the @xmath7 directions , unlike dy , ho , and pr cases .",
    "it has a ferromagnetic curie - weiss temperature @xmath17  k and a first - order transition has been observed at 0.24 k with the specific heat measurement  @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that a neutron - scattering experiment on the single crystal shows a lro in the low - temperature phase  @xcite , while a combined study using neutron diffraction and mssbauer and @xmath18sr spectroscopies  @xcite and the polarized newtron - scattering  @xcite on the polycrystals have indicated that the magnetic dipole correlation remains dynamic .",
    "recent neutron - scattering experiments have clarified a [ 111 ] rod scattering intensity in the paramagnetic phase  @xcite , which has been phenomenologically analyzed by taking into account the anisotropic superexchange interaction  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a microscopic derivation of an effective quantum pseudospin-@xmath0 model , which takes the sum of the magnetic dipole interaction and the superexchange interaction , in terms of atomic kramers doublets of yb@xmath9 ions for the frustrated magnet yb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = ti and sn ) on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the ground state of an isolted yb@xmath9 ion is characterized by the eightfold degenerate manifold @xmath19 . in the pyrochlore oxide yb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2 , the @xmath20 crystalline electric field partially lift the degeneracy , yielding the kramers ground doublet @xmath21 with @xmath22 , real coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25  @xcite , and the eigenstate @xmath26 of the total angular momentum @xmath27 , where the local coordinates @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are site - dependent , as explicitly given in [ app : coordinates ] . in particular , the quantization axis @xmath30 is always taken to be parallel to the @xmath7 direction that points from the yb site to the center of one of the two tetrahedrons to which the yb@xmath9 ion belongs .",
    "this ground doublet is energetically well separated from the first excitated doublet by 620  k  @xcite .",
    "the ground doublet has the following nonvanishing ising and transverse components of the total angular momentum @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    ", it does not contribute to the atomic quadrupole moment , as is clear from @xmath35    let us asign the pauli matrices @xmath36 to a psedospin-@xmath37 that operates on the subspace for the the atomic doublet at the site @xmath38 . then , the localized magnetic dipole moment is given by @xmath39 , \\label{eq : m}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are reasonably close to experimental values 4.27 and 1.79 , respectively , for yb@xmath6ti@xmath6o@xmath2  @xcite , with @xmath42 being the land factor .",
    "this sharply contrasts to the non - kramers magnetic doublet of pr@xmath9 ions , where @xmath43 only contributes to the magnetic dipole moment and @xmath44 to the magnetic quadrupole moment  @xcite .",
