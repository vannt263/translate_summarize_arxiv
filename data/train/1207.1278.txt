    "the `` grand - canonical fluctuation catastrophe '' @xcite of the ideal bose gas has been the subject of longstanding attention since the early days of quantum statistical mechanics @xcite ( for a comprehensive review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the epithet _",
    "_ refers to the pathologically large occupation - number fluctuations predicted for the condensate mode below the condensation temperature @xmath0 in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "such a prediction is pathological because the fluctuations must in fact become small and eventually vanish as atoms condense into the ground state as the temperature @xmath1 approaches zero .",
    "this anomaly is resolved by the introduction of weak interparticle interactions , but for a strictly ideal bose gas the problem must be considered within the canonical or microcanonical formalisms @xcite , corresponding to a diffusively isolated system with a fixed total number of particles , in order to obtain physically sensible results .    the advent of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in trapped atomic gas experiments  @xcite has lead to a revival of interest in the condensate number fluctuation problem  @xcite , as the isolation of these systems by the trapping potential makes them practically ideal realizations of the restricted statistical ensembles with finite and well - defined total particle numbers .",
    "parallel developments of experimental techniques to probe these systems via the measurement of atom - field correlations  @xcite such as the two - point , two - body coherence function  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the bosonic creation and annihilation field operators , respectively , allow us to reformulate the problem in terms of the spatial coherence of the bose field .    within the grand - canonical description of the ideal bose gas",
    "one finds that the second - order coherence at zero spatial separation is given by @xmath5  @xcite , even in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "this is simply the matter - wave analog of the celebrated hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) effect of photon `` bunching ''  @xcite  a two - particle interference effect due to the fundamental symmetry of many - body bose wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "this prediction , while being correct for high - temperature gases  @xcite , is at variance with the expectation that a bose system at temperatures well below @xmath0 should exhibit higher - order coherence and thus @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this discrepancy arises directly from the spuriously large fluctuations of the condensate occupation in the grand - canonical ensemble , and is therefore resolved in a noninteracting gas by adopting a canonical - ensemble treatment of the atom - number fluctuations in the ground state  @xcite , or by the introduction of weak interparticle interactions .    in this article",
    "we show that the canonical ensemble treatment of the ground state ( condensate mode ) occupation fluctuations also reveals an additional and counterintuitive effect : an _ anticorrelation _ dip @xmath8 in the two - body coherence function evaluated at particular finitely separated ( @xmath9 ) points @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result for noninteracting , bosonic atoms , as density anticorrelation effects are usually associated with either strong repulsive interactions in bosonic systems  @xcite or pauli blocking in fermionic systems  @xcite .",
    "we show here that the anticorrelation of density fluctuations in the trapped ideal bose gas arises from the intrinsic _ amplitude _ anticorrelation of excited single - particle trap eigenstates through their interference with the condensate mode .",
    "this effect becomes pronounced when the lowest lying excited trap eigenstates are highly populated , but requires also that the condensate mode itself exhibits partial second - order coherence , and is thus obscured by the fluctuation catastrophe in a grand - canonical calculation of @xmath12 .",
    "the two - body coherence function of a harmonically trapped ideal bose gas has previously been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works , the canonical ensemble treatment of the condensate - mode population fluctuations was implemented only to the leading order  an approximation that is well justified for systems containing a very large number ( @xmath13 ) of atoms . while this is sufficient for describing the primary effect of condensation on @xmath12  the establishment of local second - order coherence @xmath7  the restriction to very large @xmath14 also implies a vanishingly small anticorrelation dip . as we show here , the anticorrelation dip reaches appreciable sizes only in systems containing @xmath15@xmath16 atoms . in this regime",
    ", however , the leading - order approximation of the condensate population fluctuations becomes inadequate for quantitatively predicting the magnitude of the dip .",
    "here we treat the condensate - mode fluctuations exactly , using a numerical implementation of a recurrence relation for the canonical partition function  @xcite and its relation to the full counting statistics of the condensate mode population  @xcite .",
    "our treatment therefore provides a more complete and quantitatively accurate description of the two - body coherence function of a harmonically trapped ideal bose gas . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : relation - to - practice ] , the ideal - gas regime in which a canonical treatment of fluctuations is necessitated , and in which the anticorrelation dip is expected to occur , is within reach of modern experimental atomic - physics techniques .",
    "moreover , the ideal - gas analysis we present here serves as an instructive prototype for closely related anticorrelation effects in interacting - gas experiments  @xcite , which will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on a system of @xmath14 noninteracting bose atoms confined to a three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic trapping potential with frequencies @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the eigenstates of the trap by @xmath18 , and their corresponding energies by @xmath19 .",

    "an anticorrelation dip @xmath76 at finite @xmath77 is clearly visible for all three temperatures considered .",
    "this dip can easily be understood in terms of two - particle interference between excited modes of the trap and the condensate mode .",
    "any given excited mode of the trap @xmath78 has a spatial structure , varying from positive to negative with @xmath10 ( for simplicity we consider the real hermite modes of the trap ) .",
    "thus when this mode interferes constructively with the condensate ( which has a uniform phase across its extent ) at , e.g. , a point where @xmath79 , it must correspondingly interfere _ destructively _ at a point where @xmath80 .",
    "this interference produces a positive density fluctuation at the former point , and a negative density fluctuation at the latter point , and provides the basic mechanism for the anticorrelation of density fluctuations between the two points .",
    "however , the condensate mode must be at least partially coherent ( @xmath81 ) in order for this tendency towards anticorrelation to overcome the ( positive ) correlation between fluctuations at the two points due to the hbt effect .",
    "thus the anticorrelation dip is not observed in a grand - canonical treatment , due to the fluctuation catastrophe . a more detailed discussion of this fundamental mechanism is given in appendix  [ append : physical_origin ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) we plot the minimum value of @xmath58 as a function of the temperature of the gas . for comparison , the second - order coherence @xmath62 at the trap center",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) . by the arguments in appendix  [ append : physical_origin ]",
    "we expect that the magnitude of the dip in @xmath58 below the uncorrelated level of unity is , at leading order , approximately proportional to the peak fractional occupation @xmath82 of the first excited state ( along @xmath77 ) , which can be estimated to scale roughly as @xmath83  @xcite , and the results of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) are consistent with this scaling .",
    "the anticorrelation is thus more pronounced for systems containing smaller numbers of atoms , and becomes essentially negligible for @xmath13 atoms .",
    "we also note that the second - order coherence @xmath62 at the trap center does not precisely approach unity as @xmath84 [ inset to fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) ] , but in fact tends towards the @xmath85 result appropriate to a fock state of @xmath14 atoms  @xcite , illustrating the precision to which we obtain the second - order coherence in this limit .",
    "a second dependence of the anticorrelation dip on the total atom number @xmath14 is that the peak anticorrelation effect occurs at progressively higher temperatures as the atom number is increased .",
    "this can also be understood on the basis that the magnitude of the anticorrelation dip should be approximately proportional to @xmath86 : the peak value of @xmath86 in the ideal gas occurs at increasingly higher temperatures approaching @xmath69 as the atom number @xmath87  @xcite , and indeed the temperature at which the maximal anticorrelation appears is reasonably well predicted by the temperature at which the product @xmath88 ( not shown ) attains its peak value , though is somewhat skewed to lower temperatures due to the dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath1 .",
    "we note also that the dip of @xmath58 below unity broadens and becomes centered around increasing @xmath77 as the temperature of the system is lowered .",
    "this is easily understood in terms of decreasing ( positive ) contributions to @xmath58 due to hbt bunching of atoms in excited modes , which obscure the anticorrelation effect , as the temperature is reduced .     for an ideal bose gas of @xmath57 atoms in a highly anisotropic trapping potential ( @xmath90 ) .",

    "this is a particularly important case as the anisotropic confinement , for temperatures well below the excitation energy in the tightly confined transverse dimensions ( @xmath96 , where we have assumed @xmath97 ) , gives access to one - dimensional ( 1d ) physics which can be quite distinct from 3d physics  @xcite .",

    "we note , however , that some ( comparatively small ) anticorrelation can also be seen at , e.g. , @xmath120 , which is evidently due to the intrinsic amplitude anticorrelation of _ even _ ( excited ) hermite modes , illustrating that it is not solely the first hermite ( dipole ) mode which contributes to the density anticorrelation feature .    finally in this section , we note that we have applied our methodology to the case of @xmath57  atoms in a purely 1d trap , and compared the results for @xmath121 ( which agree very closely with the plotted case of @xmath90 ) with the correlations of this system estimated using monte - carlo sampling of the canonical ensemble in the coherent - state representation  @xcite .",

    "although further analysis would be required to disentangle the effects of interactions and finite expansion times on the measured correlations , it nevertheless seems natural to associate these experimental results with the fundamental physical mechanism discussed in this article : amplitude anticorrelations of excited modes yield density anticorrelations upon interfering with the condensate . in particular , at temperatures close to @xmath0 , we expect that the effects of interactions are relatively subdued , serving at leading order to simply restructure the single - particle excitations of the trap into hartree ",

    "+ 1 the physical origin of the anticorrelation dip in the second - order coherence function is the intrinsic _ amplitude _ anticorrelation of the excited energy eigenstates of the trap . the underlying mechanism can be illustrated using a simple two - mode model , consisting of the first two energy eigenmodes of a 1d harmonic trap ; i.e. , the ground mode @xmath178 and the `` dipole '' mode @xmath179 .",
    "we make minimal assumptions as to the correlations of the two modes : we assume that there are no amplitude or number correlations between the two modes ( @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively ) , and that the excited mode is incoherent , @xmath182 , while allowing for partial coherence of the condensate mode , @xmath183 . with these basic assumptions",

    "we consider the second - order coherence between the turning points @xmath187 of the dipole mode ( between which the amplitude anticorrelation is largest ) : we have @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , and thus @xmath190 clearly , in the case that the condensate mode is incoherent ( @xmath191 ) , @xmath192 . to obtain @xmath193",
    "we in fact require @xmath194 .",
    "thus partial coherence of the condensate is required in order for the dip to arise , which explains why the anticorrelation is only visible for @xmath195 , and is obscured in a grand - canonical treatment . moreover , as @xmath86 becomes small compared to @xmath38 , the value of @xmath89 required to observe the dip becomes smaller , consistent with the observation that the anticorrelation effect weakens as @xmath84 . considering the case that the condensate is perfectly coherent @xmath49 , in the limit @xmath196 we obtain @xmath197 ( where @xmath198 )  which gives a useful characterization of the dependence of the magnitude of the dip on the occupations of the two modes .",
    "this simple model obviously generalizes to the case of the gas in thermodynamic equilibrium , in which higher trap modes also produce density anticorrelations upon interfering with the condensate  though the dipole modes are expected to yield the dominant contribution to the effect , due to the relative magnitude of both their antinodes and their occupations at equilibrium .",
    "finally , we note that the anticorrelation effect can easily be understood in terms of the classical picture of hbt interferometry of optical fields  @xcite : consider the field @xmath199 radiated by an incoherent source @xmath131 ( @xmath200 ) , at two points @xmath201 and @xmath202 between which @xmath199 exhibits a @xmath203 phase difference [ @xmath204 . in the presence of a second field @xmath205 , uncorrelated with @xmath199 , that exhibits zero relative phase between @xmath201 and @xmath202 , the measured intensities at the two points will exhibit an anticorrelation @xmath206 , provided that the field @xmath207 exhibits sufficient coherence @xmath208 to overcome the hbt bunching effect .",
    "the only difference in the present case of a trapped bose gas is that no propagation is necessary to observe the effect , as the phase differences between spatial points arise naturally from the structure of harmonic - oscillator energy eigenmodes ."
