    "accretion onto a supermassive black hole is generally regarded to be powering active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . for a steady keplerian accretion disk around a black hole with mass @xmath11 ,",
    "the released energy via viscosity dissipation is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , the eddington luminosity @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath19 is independent of the specific mechanism of viscosity stress . in the regime of the standard accretion disk around a massive black hole",
    ", the disks can not produce x - ray emission .",
    "models of the accretion disks with hot corona have been suggested in order to explain the observed x - ray emission ( liang & price 1977 ) . in a popular model , a fraction @xmath8 of @xmath19",
    "is assumed to be released in the hot corona and the left ( @xmath20 ) in cold disk , but the transportation of angular momentum is mainly taking place in cold disk ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; svensson & zdziarski 1994 , kawaguchi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , the factor @xmath8 remains open since we poorly understand how the process happens in the disk .",
    "the important roles of the magnetic field turbulence have been realized in transportation of angular momentum ( balbus & hawley 1991 , tout & pringle 1992 , turner et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) and formation of the hot corona ( galeev et al .",
    "1979 , stella & rosner 1984 , merloni & fabian 2002 , liu et al . 2002 , turner 2004 , kuncic & bicknell 2004 ) .",
    "the maxwell stress is capable of transporting the angular momentum in the disk ( balbus 2003 ) .",
    "numerical simulations show the actual physical processes inside the disks are very complicated ( balbus & hawley 1991 , stone et al .",
    "1996 ; blaes 2002 ; blaes & socrates 2003 ; machida & matsumoto 2003 ; igumenshchev et al .",

    "we noted that these simulations are based on the assumption of radiative inefficiency , and can not be directly applied to explain observations . the seminal paper by galeev et al .",
    "( 1979 ) showed that the gravitational energy will be mainly released in the hot corona since the strong buoyancy and magnetic field reconnection inevitably lead to the formation of the hot corona above cold disk ( stella & rosner 1984 ) .",
    "the formation of the hot corona is most likely naturally related with the transportation of angular momentum , the factor @xmath8 can be thus obtained if the magnetic stress and energy transportation are assumed ( merloni & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "this may lend us a possible opportunity to test the working magnetic stress from hard x - ray observations .",
    "there is growing evidence in the galactic black hole candidates for that the hot corona becomes weak when @xmath21 increases ( see a review of mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) .",
    "however it is elusive how the hot corona changes with @xmath21 in agn disks .",
    "two problems remain open : 1 ) what is the proper magnetic field stress ?",
    "2 ) how to connect the two processes of angular momentum transportation and the energy release in the hot corona ?    in this _ letter _ , we look into the hard x - ray data of radio - quiet agns to see @xmath21-dependence of hard x - rays and consider the roles of magnetic turbulence in the disks .",
    "we found a strong correlation between the factor @xmath8 and the eddington ratio , implying that the energy release is driven by the eddington ratio and the importances of magnetic turbulence .",
    "table 1 gives the data of the present sample , which is composed of 56 objects consisting of 29 narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) and 27 broad seyfert 1 galaxies ( bls1s ) .",
    "col ( 1 ) is the name of the objects , col ( 2 ) the 2 - 10kev luminosity from _ asca _ observations in units of erg  s@xmath22 , col ( 3 ) the photon index between 2 - 10 kev , col ( 4 ) the bolometric luminosity in units of erg  s@xmath22 , col ( 5 ) the black hole mass in the units of solar mass .",
    "col ( 6 ) gives some notes on the objects , indicating the references of x - ray luminosity and photon index as well as the references or methods of the estimations of the black hole mass , bolometric luminosity .",
    "the black hole masses are estimated by    table 1 the sample    0.2 cm    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     fig 1 shows the plot of photon index , @xmath4 , and fraction of x - ray emission , @xmath1 , versus the eddington ratio , @xmath0 . except for phl 909 , the x - ray photon indices almost keep a constant for bls1s with a mean value of @xmath23 . there is a trend for nls1s : the higher is accretion rate , the steeper is the x - ray spectrum as @xmath24 .",
    "we find the pearson s correlation coefficient of @xmath25 is 0.37 for nls1s .",
    "the difference of @xmath26 relations in bls1s and nls1s show an interesting evidence for the bi - modal accretion in seyfert 1 galaxies . however , it is interesting to note that there is a strong correlation of @xmath4 and the eddington ratio @xmath2 for the entire sample , @xmath27 with the pearson s coefficient @xmath28 and probability @xmath29 .",
    "we use the least square method of multivariate regression and find a very strong correlation @xmath30 with coefficient @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the @xmath33-test ( much larger than @xmath34 at @xmath35 level of confidence ) .",
    "this correlation can be rewritten as @xmath36 from which an interesting conclusion follows : the hot corona is mainly controlled by the eddington ratio .",
    "shows this correlation .",
    "the correlation shows that the corona becomes dramatically weak with increases of the eddington ratio .",
    "while the eddington ratio is low , a larger fraction of the energy will be released in the hot corona .",
    "a naive expectation is that the magnetic stress responsible for the transportation of angular momentum increases with the accretion rates . otherwise the accretion would be halted because of the inefficient transportation .",
    "however , this does not agree with the observed correlation , which indicates that the dissipation in the cold disk ( not in the hot corona ) becomes more efficient with increases of the accretion rates .",
    "successful models of the hot corona should address this issue explicitly .",
    "the correlation of @xmath37 shows that the hard x - ray spectrum becomes harder with increases of @xmath2 , confirming the results of lu & yu ( 1999 ) and gierlinski & done ( 2004 ) .",
    "this is usually explained by that the seed photons efficiently cool the hot corona with increases of @xmath21 .",
    "however , this explanation could be replaced by that the hot corona really becomes weak since @xmath3 .",
    "indeed this agrees with that the broad line seyfert 1 galaxies have strong reprocessing of hard x - ray , such as in ngc 5548 ( clavel et al . 1992 ; chiang et al . 2000 ) , evidenced by that optical and uv variations follow the hard x - ray . in nsl1s",
    "the reprocessing is rather weak , such as akn 564 ( shemmer et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 4051 ( done et al . 1990 ) and iras 13224 - 3809 ( young et al .",
    "assuming that the energy transportation from the cold disk to the hot corona is by buoyancy driving the magnetic tubes across extent of the disk , merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) proposed the fraction of the energy transported by magnetic buoyancy to be @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the transporting velocity , @xmath40 the magnetic pressure and the dissipated energy @xmath41 via viscosity stress @xmath42 .",
    "we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 alfvn velocity and the constant @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "0.5 cm [ fig2 ] according to eq.(4 ) , table 2 gives the properties of the factor @xmath8 for six distinct types of the magnetic stresses based on different assumptions .",
    "comments are given in table 2 based on the correlation ( eq .",
    "3 ) . cases 1 ) , 3 ) , 4 ) and 6 ) predict properties inconsistent with the correlations in figure 1b , thus they could be ruled out . only cases 2 ) and 5 ) are possible since they provide characters of the hot corona consistent with the correlation .",
    "specifying the magnetic stress , we can solve the structure of disk and the factor @xmath8 at each radius formulated in svensson & zdziarski ( 1994 ) as described by merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) and merloni ( 2003 ) .",
    "we define the radial - averaged fraction @xmath49 , @xmath50 so that we can compare with the observation , if the magnetic stress is assumed .    in case 2 ) the magnetic pressure @xmath51 is originally suggested by stella & rosner ( 1984 ) , who argued the buoyancy controls the growth of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic stress is simply scaled by the gas pressure .",
    "such a stress can stabilize the thermal instability of the cold disk ( svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) . on the other hand , ichimaru ( 1975 ) argued that the growth of the magnetic field may be controlled by the reconnection and gave a magnetic pressure tensor @xmath52 ( case 5 ) .",
    "this stress has been extensively studied by many authors ( burm 1985 , szuszkiewicz 1990 ) .",
    "recently merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) and merloni ( 2003 ) derived this simple formulation based on analytical work ( blaes & socrates 2001 ) and 3-d mhd numerical simulation ( turner et al .",
    "2002 ) of magneto - rotational - instability in radiative accretion disks .",
    "figure 2 . shows the results of @xmath49 for the magnetic stresses @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "we find that @xmath49 is not sensitive to the black hole mass .",
    "more interesting thing in figure 2 is that the slope of @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) is insensitive to both the black hole mass and the viscosity @xmath56 , but only sensitive to the magnetic stress .",
    "these properties of the theoretical relation of @xmath54 allow us to test the working magnetic stress in disk .",
    "we have @xmath57 for the merloni & fabian s model whereas @xmath58 for the stella & rosner s .",
    "mf02 predicts a flatter slope than the observation .",
    "sr84 model has a steeper slope , but it matches the observational correlation @xmath59 within the uncertainties in the present sample .    a more fiducial test on the magnetic stress requires the accurate estimations of the black hole masses , bolometric luminosity and the total hard x - ray luminosity from observations .",
    "the near future observations of _ integral _ can provide entire hard x - ray spectra of a large sample so as to test the disk - corona models .",
    "the future 3-d mhd numerical simulations including the hot corona should be tested by the plot of @xmath60 .",
    "with the estimations of the black hole masses in radio - quiet agns , we find the hard x - ray spectrum index and @xmath61 strongly correlate with the eddington ratio .",
    "these correlations directly indicate that the fraction @xmath8 is controlled by the eddington ratio .",
    "such a correlation can be explained by the magnetic turbulence that plays two roles in transporting angular momentum and forming the hot corona .",
    "the correlation @xmath62 favors the magnetic stress @xmath9 in the present sample .",
