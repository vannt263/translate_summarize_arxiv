    "solar wind plasma is an admixture of waves , structures , and turbulent fluctuations that comprises multitude of length and time scales . owing to a great deal of disparity in the time and spatial scales , solar wind plasma exhibits rich and complex dynamical evolution .",
    "since the solar wind plasma is strongly magnetized , the presence of waves and their consequent interactions with fluctuations complicate our understanding of many aspects .",
    "for instance , the solar wind fluctuations yield a composite spectrum [ @xcite ] as described in the schematic of figure 1 .",
    "this spectrum describes the power spectral density ( psd ) as a function of frequency and can be divided into five distinct regions .",
    "the frequencies smaller than @xmath0 hz , namely region i , lead to a psd that has a spectral slope of 1 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the region ii extends from @xmath0 hz to or less than ion / proton gyrofrequency where the spectral slope exhibits an index of 3/2 or 5/3 .",
    "the latter , a somewhat controversial issue , is characterized essentially by fully developed turbulence .",
    "the region ii connects to the region iii by means of a spectral break at lengthscales corresponding to ion inertial lengthscales and frequencies corresponding to ion gyrofrequencies .",
    "the onset of the spectral break is disputed .",
    "this regime is often referred to as dissipative regime which exhibits a psd with a much broader spectral slope that varies between 2 and 5 [ @xcite ] .",
    "notably , the dynamics of the lengthscales in this region can not be described by the usual compressible or incompressible mhd models that possess characteristic frequencies smaller than ion gyro frequencies .",
    "a two fluid mhd model needs to be invoked to examine the dynamics of these high frequency and fast time scale processes .",
    "what is notable in these spectra is the waves in different regimes that interact with the turbulent fluctuations and influence the cascade dynamics [ @xcite ] . despite their prominent existence in different regimes , less is understood about the evolution of these waves and their dynamical role in governing the turbulent spectrum .",
    "for example , it is argued that the spectral break results from the damping of ion cyclotron waves .",
    "the latter is contrasted by shaikh & zank [ @xcite ] who report that hall forces could play a critical role in producing the spectral break .",
    "similarly , the excitation and interaction of whistler waves in high frequency turbulence has been disputed recently [ @xcite ] .",
    "motivated by these issues , we in this paper investigate linear waves in strongly magnetized plasma that are relevant to the understanding of the solar wind turbulence spectra depicted in fig 1 .",
    "our main objective here is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the propagating linear waves in strongly magnetized plasma especially in the regimes iii , iv and v of fig 1 .",
    "we further concentrate on a high beta plasma , because the solar wind plasma fluctuations are characterized typically by a high beta plasma beyond 1 au ( astronomical unit ) .        in section 2 ,",
    "we describe our two fluid model that contains all possible modes in the magnetized solar wind plasma . a generalized linear dispersion relation is derived . in section 3 ,",
    "we describe various possible roots , corresponding to modes .",
    "this section also describes the solution of the generalized dispersion relation and focuses on waves especially associated with a high beta ( pressure and magnetic energy ratio ) plasma .",
    "section 4 deals with the effect of plasma beta on the propagation characteristics of dispersive waves .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in section 5 .",
    "we start with a two - fluid model ( ion with suffix @xmath1 and electron with suffix @xmath2 ) . using usual notations and with finite electron mass ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath3 , the ion and electron continuity equations , momentum equations , energy equations together with the maxwell s equation ( neglecting displacement current ) are written as ( in cgs gaussian unit )    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the ion and electron number densities , @xmath9 are the ion and electron mass , @xmath10 are the ion and electron velocity , @xmath11 are the ion and electron pressure,@xmath12 are ratio of the specific heats for ions and electrons , respectively , and * e * is the electric field and * b * is the magnetic field .",
    "we use the linearized forms of the above equations with the following perturbation scheme for any variable @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 with @xmath15 are constant and uniform in space .",
    "we assume the space - time dependence of a perturbed variable @xmath16 as , @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "further , we introduce the plasma displacement vector @xmath18 as , @xmath19 , with @xmath18 as a vector . from the linearized equations for ion and electron continuity equations , and the energy equations ,",
    "one gets , ( replacing   @xmath20 ) the following :    @xmath21    the linearized form of ( [ ampere1 ] ) after combining with linearized form of ( [ farad1 ] ) , can be written as , ( with @xmath22 ) ,    @xmath23    finally , we write the linearized forms of momentum conservation equations as :    @xmath24    where we used @xmath25 and replaced @xmath26 the displacement vector for electron by the relation obtained from ( [ ampere2 ] ) , i.e.,@xmath27 and introduced the electron inertial length @xmath28 ,   @xmath29 being the electron plasma frequency . from eqn . ( [ ampere2])taking a dot - product with * k * , and also using the continuity equation ( [ mconpresie2 ] ) we get @xmath30    where the second equation denotes the quasineutrality condition . equations ( [ momconi2 ] ) and ( [ momcone2 ] ) are our starting equations for deriving the dispersion relation for a two fluid plasma .",
    "we followed the procedures adopted by ishida et al .",
    ", to get the dispersion relation and we omit the derivation in this work for brevity .",
    "we proceed by adding both the equations , eliminating the perturbed electric field @xmath31 in terms of @xmath32 using ( [ momconi2 ] ) and finally taking the dot product of the resulting equation for @xmath32 with three independent vectors , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the unit vector along the unperturbed magnetic field @xmath36 .",
    "the final generalized dispersion relation reads as    @xmath37\\left[\\omega^4-k^2(v_a^2+c_s^2)\\omega^2 + k^2v_a^2k^2c_s^2\\cos^2\\theta\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\omega^2k^2 d_e^2(\\omega^2-k^2c_s^2)\\right]= \\omega^2v_a^2k^2d_i^2 k^2\\cos^2\\theta ( \\omega^2-k^2c_s^2);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the ion plasma frequency , and @xmath40 is the angle between the wave vector * k * and unperturbed magnetic field @xmath36 , and @xmath41 are the alfvn speed and sound speed , respectively .",
    "this dispersion relation ( [ dispersie1 ] ) incorporates both the ion and electron inertial length scales , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively",
    ". moreover , equation ( [ dispersie1 ] ) is essentially the same as the dispersion relations obtained by earlier authors in refs [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is easy to see that for electron mass @xmath44 , which is equivalent to putting @xmath45 , eqn .",
    "( [ dispersie1 ] ) reduces to @xmath46\\left[\\omega^4-k^2(v_a^2+c_s^2)\\omega^2 + k^2v_a^2k^2c_s^2\\cos^2\\theta\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\omega^2v_a^2k^2d_i^2 k^2\\cos^2\\theta ( \\omega^2-k^2c_s^2);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the usual hall mhd dispersion relation obtained by ishida et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] . for both @xmath47 eqn .",
    "( [ dispersie1 ] ) reduces to the dispersion relation for an ideal mhd , showing the existence of shear alfvn wave , fast and slow magnetosonic waves .",
    "+ from the dispersion relation ( [ dispersishi ] ) ishida et al [ @xcite ] have shown some interesting effects of the presence of ion inertial length .",
    "it is shown that for the limit @xmath48 , the incompressible mhd alfvn wave becomes compressible and the mhd compressible slow wave becomes incompressible .",
    "while we postpone similar studies for the inclusion of electron inertial length for our future work , we shall study the effects of plasma @xmath49 on the linear waves in solar wind from the dispersion relation ( [ dispersie1 ] ) .",
    "for that we normalize the frequency @xmath50 by some characteristic frequency @xmath51,so that the dimensionless frequency @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be some characteristic speed .",
    "thus @xmath54 will be some characteristic length , choosing @xmath55 , and note that @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are alfvnic and sonic mach numbers .",
    "we next normalize @xmath50 by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the phase velocity , and @xmath61 is the normalized phase velocity .",
    "the linear phase velocity relation can then be expressed as    @xmath62= \\left[v_p^4-(1+\\beta)v_p^2 + \\beta\\cos^2\\theta + v_p^2(kd_e)^2(v_p^2-\\beta)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & = v_p^2(kd_i)^2 \\cos^2\\theta(v_p^2-\\beta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so the final form of the dispersion relation given by eqn.([dispdimless ] ) is essentially an equation showing the angular dependence of normalized phase velocity to plasma @xmath49 and the ion electron inertial length scales .",
    "we have developed a matlab code to solve the generalized dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ dispdimless ] ) .",
    "the dispersion relation is 6th order in frequency .",
    "hence six roots are expected .",
    "three roots correspond to forward and the remaining three represent backward propagating waves .",
    "the generalized dispersion relation , eq .",
    "( [ dispdimless ] ) , spans a wider parameter regime and exhibits a variety of waves for various angle , beta , length - scales comparable with the electron and ion inertial skin depths . in this paper",
    ", we nonetheless restrict ourselves to the parameter regime that is a representive of the solar wind plasma corresponding to the length scales that are associated with the ion cyclotron frequency .    as a first step , we verify the consistency of our equation by comparing it with the mhd waves @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "we use @xmath63 that reduces the dispersion relation to the usual compressible mhd relation .",
    "we retrieve mhd waves that are consistent with ref @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig ( 1a ) that describes a phase velocity variation of the mhd waves as a function of angle between the propagation wave vector and the mean magnetic field , i.e. @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "we find three forward propagating modes with positive phase velocity that co - exist with three backward propagating modes with negative phase velocity .",
    "it is noteworthy that the shear alfvn and slow modes are partially overlapped . in this regime ,",
    "linear dynamics is entirely governed by the magnetosonic waves which is shown by the top curve in fig ( 1a ) .",
    "a pure magnetic perturbation propagating orthogonal to the constant magnetic field in this regime behaves electrostatically and tends to move as a magnetosonic mode .",
    "we next investigate the effect of a finite plasma beta on the propagation of the small scale magnetized waves to explore their dynamics in regimes iii and iv in fig ( 1 ) .",
    "we choose parameters @xmath66 that are characterize the high frequency modes between regions ii and iii . since this parameter regime is not drastically different than the typical mhd regime , a non trivial modification in the dispersion of mhd waves is expected . for instance , the linear dynamics in this regime is governed predominantly by the higher frequency and short scale waves , namely kinetic alfvn and magnetosonic waves . the density perturbation becomes significant in this regime .",
    "the dispersion of high frequency kinetic alfvn , shown in fig ( 2b ) , differs significantly from that in fig ( 2a ) .",
    "the phase velocity of the kinetic alfvn waves is increased , while the obliquely propagating kinetic alfvn modes continue to remain unaffected .",
    "the shear alfvn / slow modes decouple clearly .",
    "the fast modes travel with higher phase speed , whereas the slow modes propagate slower ( than in fig 2a ) .",
    "it is further clear from fig ( 2b ) that the propagation of the fast / slow modes depends crucially on the alignment of their wave vector relative the mean magnetic field . for a highly oblique propagation",
    ", these waves hardly move .",
    "figure ( 2c ) describes a regime where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is a regime where mhd modes are drastically altered and low frequency whistler modes start to play critical role . shown in fig ( 2c ) ,",
    "the top curve is the whistler branch that survives whereas the bottom curves are reminiscent of mhd modes ( alfvn and fast / slow ) .",
    "as seen in fig ( 2c ) , the whistler modes have higher frequency and phase speeds .",
    "they propagate predominantly along the field lines , whereas oblique whistlers have smaller phase speeds . at an angle @xmath69",
    ", the whistler modes do not propagate .",
    "they are transformed into high frequency electrostatic modes .",
    "figure ( 2c ) describes waves that possess length scales smaller than the ion inertial length , but bigger than electron inertial length scale .",
    "we can retrieve the small scale waves by choosing the small characteristic length scales of these waves relative to the ion inertial and electron inertial length scales .",
    "this is shown in fig ( 3 ) .",
    "this figure is further consistent with fig ( 2 ) where the dynamics of small scale is described by choosing a relatively small magnitude of @xmath70 compared to @xmath42 and @xmath43 lengths .    .",
    "note that the phase velocity of the small scale wave is consistent with fig ( 2).,width=453 ]",
    "we next investigate effect of plasma beta ( ratio of plasma pressure and magnetic energy ) on the propagation of dispersive waves in the solar wind plasma .",
    "we keep the angle of propagation constant ( @xmath71 ) and vary plasma @xmath49 and study the waves corresponding to the small and large scale modes .",
    "a snap shot for the large scale waves is shown in fig ( 4 ) that depicts effects of low ( fig 4a ) and high ( fig 4b ) plasma beta on the propagating waves .",
    "we find that the large scale alfvn and slow waves continue to remain unaffected with regard to the beta varation .",
    "the propagation speed of the fast waves appears to grow linearly with the plasma beta .",
    "hence there is a dramatic speed enhancement occurs for the fast waves .",
    "this is shown in fig ( 4b ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that the propagation property of the dispersive waves corresponding to the small scale modes does not depend critically on the plasma beta .",
    "almost all of these small scale waves remain unaffected relative to the beta variation .",
    "this is shown in fig ( 5a ) for the low beta regime , whereas fig ( 5b ) describes the effect of high plasma beta on the small scale dispersive waves .",
    "a major outcome of work is the inclusion of electron and ion inertia in strongly magnetized waves associated with a high beta plasma .",
    "we invoked a two fluid or hall mhd model to examine the dynamics of these high frequency and fast time scale processes .",
    "we see that for the length scales @xmath72 , where there the turbulent spectra shows a different power law behavior , the linear waves are significantly modified .",
    "it is clear from our work that the evolution of the linear waves in the mhd regime is modifed significantly in the dissipative or dispersive regime where @xmath73 .",
    "this is the regime where solar wind turbulence is affected non trivially by the linear collision less waves .",
    "we find from our linear theory that mhd modes , such as alfvn and fast / slow waves , are inconsequential in the small scale @xmath73 regime .",
    "this is because the mhd modes are relatively large scale and low frequency modes in comparison with the kinetic alfvn and/or whistler modes that are typically excited in the @xmath73 regimes of fig ( 1 ) . because of the great disparity in the length and time scales , the waves in the two distinct regimes ( i.e. regimes iii , iv and v in fig 1 ) do not couple efficiently",
    "consequently , the linear dynamics of modes in the regimes iv and v is governed predominantly by fast and whistler modes respectively . the latter have a greater phase velocity relative to the mhd modes .",
    "our results are important particularly to understand linear waves in the solar wind turbulence in the regime where small scale fluctuations exhibit dispersive characteristics [ @xcite ] .",
