    "double neutron star binaries ( dnss ) are observed in the field of the milky way and in globular clusters , so they can form through two different channels : ( i ) evolution of primordial massive star binaries , formed in the galactic field ( field scenario ; narayan , paczynski & piran 1992 ) , and ( ii ) dynamical formation , through three - body interactions in globular clusters ( gcs ) involving the exchange of a light star companion of a neutron star with an incoming isolated neutron star ( gc scenario ; grindlay , portegies zwart & mc millan 2006 ) .    in this letter",

    "we compare the model results with the redshift distribution of the sample of _ swift _ sgrbs in the first two years of operation , with the aim of disentangling the relative importance of the two sgrb populations at different cosmic epochs .",
    "in this section we compute the intrinsic formation history of sgrbs for the two scenarios : the field scenario , where dnss correlate with the overall star formation and the dynamical one inside gcs .    in the field scenario , the intrinsic formation rate , defined as the number of bursts per unit time and unit comoving volume at redshift @xmath1 , @xmath3 is given by the convolution of the massive star binary formation rate and a delay time distribution function @xmath4 .",
    "the delay is the time interval between the formation of the massive star binary and the merging of the dnss due to gravitational wave emission .",

    "( 2006 ) considered @xmath16 proportional to the observed star formation rate .",
    "here we explore here three different possibilities for @xmath16 :    * model gc1 : constant between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and null outside this interval , as suggested from studies of gc formation in the cosmological context ( kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ) ; * model gc2 : obtained from the gc age distribution of the spiral galaxy m31 ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) ; * model gc3 : obtained from the gc age distribution of the elliptical galaxy m87 ( cohen , blakeslee & ryzhov 1998 ) .    for a comparison with hopman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we explore a model where @xmath16 follows the star formation rate , here computed following hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) , and referred as model gc4 .    as regard to the function @xmath19 ,",
    "the delay time is the sum of the interval between the formation of the gc and the dynamical formation of the dns , plus the dns coalescence time due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "the first time interval is set equal to the core - collapse time since , only after the gc has experienced core - collapse , the rate of dns formation due to gravitational encounters becomes relevant ( hopman et al .",
    "so the delay function @xmath20 is the convolution of the core ",
    "collapse time distribution and the gravitational wave coalescence time distribution .",
    "following hopman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the former is computed from the compilation of the half - mass relaxation times and concentrations of the observed gcs in our galaxy by harris ( 1996 ) combined with the core - collapse time distribution from quinlan ( 1996 ) .",
    "the latter is obtained from three - body simulations of encounters between single neutron stars and target binaries in gcs .",
    "the resulting distribution of eccentricities and orbital periods of the simulated dns binaries yields a delay function @xmath21 ( cerutti 2007 ) in close agreement with hopman et al .",

    "we assume a luminosity function described by a double power - law    @xmath44    with @xmath45 ( schmidt 2001 ) in order to reduce the number of model free parameters .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we fit the differential photon flux distribution of sgrbs with @xmath48 s detected by batse in the 50 - 300 kev band ( paciesas et al .",
    "we consider the observed photon fluxes in the 64 ms timing window , restrict our fitting procedure to @xmath49 ph s@xmath50 @xmath51 for which the detector response is efficient , and adopt a effective field of view for batse , defined as @xmath52 of 1.8 yr .",
    "the best fit parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "we obtain a reasonable fit to batse data in all formation scenarios by adjusting the free parameters of the model . in this work",
    "we neglect the presence of a possible contamination from soft gamma - ray repeaters at low redshifts ( hurley et al .",
    "2005 ) which is still difficult to quantify ( see chapman et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we then compute the expected sgrb rate in the 15150 kev band of _ swift _ adopting a field of view @xmath53 sr , and a 2-year mission . for a correct comparison between model results and _ swift _ data , we calculate the photon peak flux for _ swift _ sgrbs in a timing window similar to the one used on batse .",
    "peak fluxes of swift grbs are calculated on different integration times , spanning from 64 to 448 ms , in order to match common significance criteria and compatibly with the duration of the peak itself .",
    "these are consistent within uncertainties with the corresponding values integrated on a fixed 64-ms window .",
    "this makes the comparison with batse well grounded .",
    "the photon fluxes @xmath54 for the sgrbs observed with _",
    "swift _ are collected in table  2 .",
    "the few _ swift _ detections do not allow to construct a reliable differential peak flux distribution .",
    "however , we expect @xmath55 sgrbs per year with @xmath56 ph s@xmath50 @xmath51 for all our models , in agreement with the 7 sgrbs per year detected by _",
    "swift _ at the same flux limit .",
    "note that this is a lower limit since we do not consider here sgrbs that are identified in the ground analysis ( e.g. , grb  051114 ) and those long grbs that could be tentatively ascribed to the short category ( e.g. , grb  060614 , and 060505 ) .",
    "lowering the _ swift _ photon flux threshold down to 1 ph s@xmath50 @xmath51 , the expected sgrb detections largely exceed the number of identified sgrbs .",
    "this fact may be related to a different energy band and trigger procedure of _ swift _ and batse .",
    "we thus choose the threshold of 2 ph s@xmath50 @xmath51 as measured in a 64 ms timing window as reliable detection limit for _",
    "in table  2 we list all sgrbs detected by _ swift _ until march 2007 with , when present , the redshift .",
    "we note that grb  050509b , 050906 , and 051210 are not included in our analysis being their photon flux in the 64 ms timing window below the threshold limit we adopted . to be conservative , we assume that grb  050813 lies at @xmath57 instead of @xmath58 . the shaded area in fig .  1 accounts for the observed cumulative @xmath1distribution including the uncertainties due the lack of a secure redshift determination for some sgrbs .",
    "model results computed for the different dns formation channels are shown in fig .  1 : solid line refers to the field scenario , dot  short dashed for gc1 , dotted for gc2 , dashed for gc3 , and dot  long dashed for gc4 . for the field scenario our fit is close to model ( ii ) of guetta & piran ( 2007 ) .",
    "for the gc scenario , we note that in spite of the different assumptions of the gc formation rate , the expected sgrb @xmath1distributions are not remarkably different .",
    "the key result is that dnss from dynamical interactions in gc may account only for the lowest redshift sgrbs , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "we find that only 412% of sgrbs in gc should lie above @xmath60 .",
    "this result is expected owing to the longer delay times in the formation and coalescence of dnss in gcs relative to the field .",
    "field dnss form earlier and for this reason they can account for the sgrb distribution above @xmath61 instead , the field scenario results inconsistent with _ swift _ data below this redshift .",
    "this appears to be little affected by our choice of @xmath62 in the luminosity function , although the best  fit parameters in table 1 may vary significantly .",
    "hopman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) first noticed that sgrbs at low@xmath1 may come from dynamical formation of dnss in gcs and possibly ascribed all the sgrbs in the _ swift _ catalogue to this formation channels .",
    "we find here that _ swift _",
    "2-year data seem favour a bimodal origin of sgrbs : the nearby , low@xmath1 bursts resulting preferentially from dynamical forming dnss , whereas distant , high-@xmath1 bursts resulting from the coalescence of primordial dnss following the cosmic star formation history .",
    "although current uncertainties are very large and the data sample poor , we can try to quantify the relative weight of the two channels . in order to reproduce the observed limits on the redshift distribution of sgrbs , almost 30%70% of sgrbs detected by _",
    "swift _ should come from primordial ns - ns binary mergers if models gc1 or gc3 are considered . for model gc2",
    "this fraction increases up to 5080% .",
    "we can rewrite these results in terms of the ratio between the intrinsic formation rates at @xmath42 in the two channels , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "we find that @xmath64 for model gc1 and gc3 , and @xmath65 for gc2 . a large sample of sgrb detection and host identifications are needed in order to confirm these findings .",
    "we have shown that current _ swift _ data seem to point towards a dual nature of sgrb formation : low@xmath1 sgrbs may arise from the coalescence of dnss forming in gcs through dynamical collisions , whereas high@xmath1 bursts can represent the end ",
    "result of dns mergers born in the field from primordial massive binary stars .",
    "a way to falsify this bimodality is by considering the correlation between sgrbs and the host galaxy type ( gam - yam et al .",
    "2005 ; zheng & ramirez - ruiz 2007 ; berger et al . 2007b ; shin & berger 2007 ) .",
    "we expect that sgrbs from the gc channel should be found preferentially in early type galaxies where the bulk of gcs resides , although we can not completely exclude a few in spirals . on the contrary",
    ", field sgrbs can be hosted in both early and late type galaxies given the wide distribution of delay times ( section 2 ) .",
    "since the dynamical channel produces sgrbs at low@xmath1 , we expect to find a excess of sgrbs in early type galaxies below @xmath66 . at present",
    "it is still premature to exploit this issue in a statistically meaningful manner and we may just confine ourselves to the analysis of sgrbs in the current limited sample . up to now",
    ", four sgrbs have been localised in early - type galaxies ( grb  050509b , 050724 , 050813 , and 060502b ) , whereas six have secure late - type hosts ( grb  051221a , 060801 , 061006 , 061210 , and 061217 , berger 2007 ; _ hete - ii _ grb  050709 at @xmath67 ; fox et al .",
    "2005 ; covino et al .",
    "2 shows the fraction of sgrb hosts in early ( shaded area ) and late ( white area ) below @xmath68 and above , respectively .",
    "we note indeed that low@xmath1 sgrbs are associated preferentially to early - type galaxies while the high@xmath1 ones are located in late - type . the large off  set of grb  050509b and 060502b may support further the association of these sgrbs with dnss formed dynamically in gcs ."
