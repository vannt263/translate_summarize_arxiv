    "we motivate our studies on simulations of an electro - magnetic particle - in - cell ( empic ) method and an optimal combination of the different components .",
    "pic methods are an important tool to understand the plasma dynamics through solution of the electrostatic and electro - magnetic equations , see the classical introduction in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while pic is extremely application driven , the standard schemes as discussed in @xcite has to be adapted for the different problem , e.g. strong external magnetic field , see @xcite and @xcite , electro - static or electro - magnetic applications , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further the different numerical ideas to solve the time - dependencies , e.g. explicit or implicit schemes , has an extremely influence to the numerical stability of the pic codes .",
    "for example , an explicit solver with integration time step @xmath0 had to satisfy @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the electron plasma frequency , see @xcite or the courant - friedlich - levy condition @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wave phase velocity .",
    "further the grid solver has to satisfy the electron debye length @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the debye length and @xmath7 is a constant of order @xmath8 .    in the following three parts of the pic scheme",
    "are involved and given as :    * pusher ( scheme to solve the mesh - free equation of motions ) .",
    "* solver ( scheme to solve the mesh - based potential equations ) .",
    "* interpolation ( approximation schemes to couple the mesh - free parameters with the mesh parameters )    all three parts are important and we have to deal with their numerical error to reduce the full error of the pic approximation .",
    "second , the physical constraints , as conservation of mass , momentum and energy are important to the physical experiments and should be conserved by the underlying schemes .",
    "we concentrate on improving the pusher part ( time - integrator ) to reduce the errors of the particle tracking and to optimize the computational amount .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we discuss the mathematical model .",
    "the different time - integrator methods are presented in section [ integrator ] . in section [ num ]",
    ", we present the numerical approaches of the electro - static model and in section [ num2 ] we discuss the benefits of improved integrators to the electro - magnetic model .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ concl ] .",
    "in the following , we present the two models , which are numerically analyzed in the experiments with different time - integrator methods .      for the electro - static model , we deal with the following equations .",
    "the equations of motions ( microscopic scales ) are given for the electro - static model as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the position and velocity of a particle , @xmath11 is the charge and @xmath12 is the mass of the particle .",
    "further we have the additional electro - static equations which are solved on the grid ( macroscopic scales ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric potential and @xmath14 is the electric field , which are given self - consistent , see @xcite .    while the microscopic scales are solved with ode solvers , and spatial mesh - free methods .",
    "the idea of the electrostatic pic is instead of calculating the equation of motion for each charged particle , one can solve it for so called `` super particles '' , representing thousands of real particles .",
    "further the solvers for the poisson equations are based on a grid .",
    "for such equations we have also very fast grid based solvers , e.g. iterative schemes as ilu or superlu .    to connect the particles , which are moving grid - less to a grid and vice versa .",
    "we have to define an interpolation , between the particles and the grids .",
    "we have to define a interpolation function @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the grid - point and @xmath17 the position of the super - particle @xmath18 .    with this interpolation function the weighting of the particle charge @xmath19 of the particle @xmath18 at",
    "the the position @xmath17 to the grid - point @xmath20 gives the particle charge density at this grid point @xmath21 @xmath22 with the cell size @xmath23 and @xmath24 the number of particles .",
    "further the time - steps have to resolve the langmuir wave propagation and the cell size have to resolve the electron debye - length .      for the electro - magnetic model",
    ", we deal with the following equations .",
    "the equations of motions ( microscopic scale ) are given as : @xmath25 where we have additional the magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "further the electro - magnetic equations , which are solved in the pic scheme on the grid ( macroscopic scales ) are given as : @xmath27    for the electromagnetic pic ( empic ) , we have to extend the classical electrostatic pic , with respect to the magnetic fields .",
    "the particles in the field have additional influence due to the magnetic fields , means the trajectories are also influences with the magnetic field .    here",
    ", we have to taken into account an extension of the standard integrators , see @xcite .",
    "in the following , we discuss the different ideas :    * explicit schemes , * implicit schemes , * hamiltonian - based schemes .",
    "explicit schemes are forward schemes , while need not additional steps , e.g. inversion , to obtain the next solution , see @xcite .    by the way , due to the simple algorithms , the explicit integrators have the drawback of the restrictions to the time - steps . especially for the pic method , we have taken into account :    * debye - length ( smallest spatial ) : @xmath28 , @xmath6 debye - length .",
    "* langmuir frequency ( smallest time - steps ) : @xmath29 , @xmath30 plasma frequency .    such restrictions neglect large time - steps and reduce the effectively in the numerical computations . in the following example [ exam_1 ]",
    ", we present a simple explicit integrator applied to an electro - magnetic model .",
    "[ exam_1 ] explicit boris integrator , see @xcite : @xmath31 where the intermediate solutions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are computed a separated third step ( see strang - splitting in equation ( [ stran_1_1])-([stran_1_2 ] ) .",
    "the idea of the implicit integrators , are to remove the need to resolve such small scales ( debye length and langmuir frequency ) .",
    "the unsolved scales are kept in an approximate way allowing the coupling and energy transfer with larger and slower scales that are instead fully resolved .",
    "* direct implicit methods , see @xcite . * implicit moment methods ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the implicit schemes have the advantage of larger time - steps .",
    "they are important in the electro - magnetic models , while the light - wave propagation is important . for the explicit schemes we have the restriction @xmath34 of the stability , while for the implicit schemes it is not necessary , see @xcite .",
    "we deal with the following boris - integrator , which is done implicit , see @xcite : @xmath35    to conserve the physical behavior also with implicit methods , we have to be taken into account , that in the larger time - step , the underlying fluctuations are frozen or at least static .",
    "for example , we neglect the small scales , example quantum mechanical effects , e.g. de haas - van alphen effect .",
    "de haas  van alphen effect , which is a quantum mechanical effect in which the magnetic moment of a pure metal crystal oscillates as the intensity of an applied magnetic field b is increased .",
    "the period , when plotted against @xmath36 , is inversely proportional to the area @xmath37 of the extremal orbit of the fermi surface , in the direction of the applied field .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath37 is the area of the fermi surface normal to the direction of @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian - based methods are taken into account the conservation of the symplecticity with respect to the hamiltonian - form .",
    "such orbit integrator methods are based on the ideas to reformulate the equation of motion in electric and magnetic fields , see @xcite .",
    "based on the reformulation of the equation of motions ( [ electro_mag_1])-([electro_mag_2 ] ) to a hamiltonian form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "further in the case of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field , we have also to derive the hamiltonian .",
    "in the following , we apply the different time - integrator methods with respect to their efficiency and their accuracy of the numerical results . we test :    * euler - forward integrators ( a - b splitting ) , * boris integrator ( strang - splitting ) , * boris integrator with space filters ( energy conserved method ) .",
