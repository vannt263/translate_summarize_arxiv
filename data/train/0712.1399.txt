    "the exact computation of correlation functions for strongly correlated quantum systems has been one of the major problems for years .",
    "although , in general , this is exceedingly difficult to achieve , several analytical approaches especially in 1d quantum integrable models have been provided to derive exact or manageable expressions of correlation functions .",
    "for instance , the low - energy behavior of correlation functions for gapless models can be systematically obtained by conformal field theory @xcite . on the other hand , for systems with finite spectral gaps ,",
    "the long - distance and -time asymptotics are investigated by ( finite - temperature ) form factor expansions ( see @xcite for recent developments ) .",
    "an alternative approach , which has been developed in these several years particularly for the spin-1/2 xxz chain , is to combine the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite with solutions to the quantum inverse problem for local spin operators @xcite . using this , kitanine _ et al _ derived multiple integral representations for zero - temperature correlation functions of the xxz chain with an external field @xcite .",
    "their representations can be regarded as natural extensions of the results based on the @xmath0-vertex operator approach @xcite , which is restricted to the zero - magnetic field case .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is that the formulation can be flexibly generalized to finite temperature and/or time dependent case @xcite by combining a lattice path integral formulation .",
    "furthermore , by considering a continuum limit of the xxz chain , correlation functions of the 1d boson system with delta function interaction can be obtained at finite temperature @xcite ( see also @xcite for the zero - temperature case ) .    beyond spin systems ,",
    "more recently we further extended the method to the calculation of correlation functions for fermion systems . by use of the fermionic @xmath1-operator @xcite acting directly on the fermionic fock space ,",
    "we have derived multiple integral representations of zero - temperature correlation functions for an interacting spinless fermion model with arbitrary particle density @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the former results to the finite - temperature case by use of the quantum transfer matrix technique utilizing a concept of path integral @xcite . especially considered here is the equal - time one - particle green s function .",
    "our formula agrees with previously known results in the following three limits : the zero - temperature , infinite - temperature and the free fermion limits .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we review the quantum transfer matrix method for the spinless fermion model , and express the correlation function in terms of matrix elements of the monodromy operator . in section 3",
    ", we present the key ingredients of the computation for the correlation function .",
    "the multiple integral representation for the equal - time one - particle green s function at finite temperature with arbitrary particle density is summarized in the main theorem . in section 4 ,",
    "the three special limits are evaluated .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a brief discussion .",
