    "one example involves high - eccentricity migration of giant planets : tidal dissipation in the planet is responsible for circularizing the planet s orbit , leading to the creation of hot jupiters ( e.g. wu & murray 2003 , fabrycky & tremaine 2007 , correia et al .",

    "2012 , storch & lai 2014 ) constraints can not easily be explained by simple viscous dissipation in the turbulent fluid envelope ( goldreich & nicholson 1977 ) . while several mechanisms based on wave excitation and dissipation in the envelope ( ocean ) have been studied ( e.g. ogilvie & lin 2004 , ivanov & papaloizou 2007 ; see ogilvie 2014 for a review ) , it remains unclear whether they can provide sufficient dissipation .",
    "dissipation in the solid cores of giants planets is another possible source of dissipation .",
    "previous works ( remus et al . 2012 , storch & lai 2014 , remus et al . 2015 ) have employed analytical formulae for the tidal dissipation in a two - layer planet consisting of a uniform , incompressible , viscoelastic core and a uniform non - dissipative ocean ( e.g. dermott 1979 ) .",
    "these works demonstrate that , while there are significant uncertainties in the rheologies of the solid core , it is in principle possible for dissipation in the core to be substantial enough to account for existing constraints , particularly the dependence of dissipation on the tidal forcing frequency ( storch & lai 2014 ) .",

    "we now consider the effects of viscous dissipation in the solid core . according to the correspondence principle ( biot 1954 )",

    "visco_elastic core . in general",
    ", the complex @xmath12 depends on the tidal forcing frequency @xmath52 in the rest frame of the planet , and its actual form depends on the rheology of the solid ( e.g henning et al .",
    "2009 , remus et al .",
    "thus the complex @xmath53 also depends on the forcing frequency .",

    "see storch & lai ( 2014 ) for the more general case of a perturber on an eccentric orbit .",
    "note that @xmath58 includes contributions both from dissipation into heat , which occurs solely in the viscoelastic core , and from the torque @xmath59 that acts to synchronize the rotation rate of the planet with the orbital frequency of the perturber .",

    "heat = - _ s t_z .",
    "in this section we present several sample applications of the formulae derived in the previous section . first we consider planets with non - dissipative cores , then generalize to a complex shear modulus and compute the tidal dissipation .      in figure 1",

    "our nominal reference value for @xmath12 is that of undamaged rocky material at earth - like pressures and temperatures , @xmath63 kbar .",
    "damaged rocky , or icy material can have a lower shear modulus @xmath64 kbar ( goldsby & kohlstedt 2001 , henning et al .",
    "however , little is known about both the composition of giant cores and the behavior of rocky / icy materials under high pressures and thus the value of @xmath12 is largely a free parameter .",
    "based on fig . 1",
    ", we note that the love numbers generally behave as expected .",
    "cores with higher shear moduli are harder to deform , resulting in smaller love numbers .",
    "planets with cores of larger radii have more mass concentrated in the center , and thus @xmath1 decreases as a function of @xmath10 . at @xmath65 ,",
    "i.e. in the absence of a core , @xmath1 correctly defaults to the standard value for an @xmath0 envelope , @xmath66 . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the core mass is equal to planet mass , i.e. the envelope has zero mass but still artificially extends to @xmath61 . in this case @xmath1 and @xmath4 default to values for a bare core : h_2c,0 = ,  k_2,0 = ( ) ^5 .",
    "[ h0k0 ]    in figure 2 we present the love numbers for a planet with a core of constant mass , @xmath68 , as a function of the core shear modulus @xmath12 , for three different core radii . for the range of core sizes considered ( up to @xmath69 ) , changing the shear modulus by @xmath70 orders of magnitude",
    "apparently hardly changes the surface tidal @xmath1 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "core radius plays a slightly more important role , with smaller cores yielding smaller @xmath1 , as expected ( note this is opposite to fig .",
    "1 because here we are keeping core mass rather than core density constant ) . perhaps surprisingly , smaller cores are deformed more than larger cores ( top panel ) .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the amount of deformation depends on @xmath71 , the ratio of the core shear modulus to the the gravitational rigidity @xmath72 of the core , with larger ratios yielding smaller deformations ( cf .",
    ". [ h0k0 ] ) . for constant core mass ,",
    "this ratio scales as @xmath73 , and therefore the core deforms less at higher radii .",
    "we now consider tidal dissipation of a viscoelastic core , modeled by a complex shear modulus .",
    "we take _ 1 + i _ 2 , and assume the simplest viscoelastic model - the maxwell model , such that ( henning et al .",
    "2009 ) _ 1 & = & , + _ 2 & = & - , where @xmath52 is the forcing frequency in the reference frame of the planet , and @xmath74 is the maxwell frequency given by @xmath75 , where @xmath12 is the normal shear modulus of the core and @xmath76 the viscosity of the core . under the maxwell model ,",

    "figure 3 shows tidal dissipation rates , characterized by @xmath79 $ ] , as a function of the forcing frequency , for different values of @xmath12 and @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath76 only enters into the expression for @xmath12 through the ratio @xmath80 , it is not surprising that changing @xmath76 simply shifts the tidal dissipation curve horizontally without changing the strength ( fig .",
    "3 , bottom ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath12 is more complicated ( fig .",
    "3 , top panel ) and can shift the curve up / down as well . since @xmath12 does not directly affect the viscous properties of the core , it makes sense that a change in @xmath12 shifts the curve such that the tidal response on the viscous side ( @xmath77 ) remains unchanged .      an analytical formula for the tidal number",
    "@xmath1 was previously derived for giant planet models with uniform envelope density ( dermott 1979 ) .",
    "recent works have used viscoelastic dissipation in the solid cores of such models to explain the amount of tidal dissipation inferred from the evolution of jupiter s and saturn s satellites ( remus et al .",
    "2012 , remus et al . 2015 ) and from constraints on high - eccentricity migration of hot jupiters ( storch & lai 2014 ) . in figure 4",
    "we compare the dissipation levels in planets with @xmath0 vs uniform - density envelopes .",
    "while we do not attempt to explore the full parameter space here , figure 4 suggests that the difference between the two depends most strongly on the density of the core , with the @xmath0 dissipation being stronger in more compact cores by as much as a factor of few .",
    "while in this work we focus mainly on gas giants , the formulae presented in section 3 do not assume the core radius to be small .",
    "thus , in principle , they may be applied to super - earths - with the caveat that super - earths are not likely to be well - described by @xmath0 envelopes . in figure 5",
    "we present the love numbers for a super - earth analogue similar to kepler-11d ( lissauer et al .",
    "2013 ) , consisting of a solid core and a @xmath0 gas envelope that is @xmath81 by mass , but @xmath82 by radius . in this case",
    "the effect of the `` core '' shear modulus on the surface @xmath1 is significant when @xmath12 is varied by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "we have presented a general method of computing the tidal love numbers of giant planets consisting of a uniform elastic solid core and a non - uniform fluid envelope .",

    "these expressions are valid for any core size , density , and shear modulus .",
    "they allow us to compute the tidal dissipation rate in the viscoelastic core of a planet by using a complex shear modulus that characterizes the rheology of the solid core .",
    "our results improve upon previous works that are based on planetary models with a solid core and a uniform ( @xmath2 ) envelope . in general",
    ", we we find that while for diffuse ( low density , larger size ) cores , the dissipation rates of the @xmath2 envelope models can be higher than the @xmath0 models , for more compact cores the @xmath0 envelope models have higher dissipation rates by as much as a factor of few .",
    "while we have focused on analytical expressions for the love numbers in this paper , our method and equations can be adapted for numerical computation of the real ( non - dissipative ) love numbers for any envelope equation of state .",
    "in particular , they can be used to study tidal distortion of super - earths , which typically contain a h - he envelope ( a few percent by mass ) surrounding a rocky core ( e.g. , lissauer , dawson & tremaine 2014 ) , or tidal distortion in gas giants with more realistic equations of state .",
    "it is possible that for some exoplanetary systems , particularly those containing hot jupiters , the tidal love number @xmath1 can be constrained or measured using secular planet - planet interactions ( e.g. mardling 2010 , batygin & becker 2013 ) .",
    "this would provide a useful probe of the interior structure of the planet .    in the presence of viscosity in the solid core , additional",
    "work is still needed to obtain the tidal viscoelastic dissipation rate even when numerical results for the real love numbers are available .",
