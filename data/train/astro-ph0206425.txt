    "the recent identification of a supernova at @xmath0 ( riess et al .",

    "linder ( 1988a ; 1988b ) has examined the physical nature of various quintessence components ; with @xmath6 equating to non - relativistic matter ( dust ) , @xmath7 being radiation and @xmath8 , a classical cosmological constant .",

    "the value of the quintessence component , @xmath13 , influences our view of the universe , modifying the various distances used in mapping the cosmos . this paper concerns itself with the influence of @xmath13 on angular diameter distances , especially in relation to the determination of the hubble s constant from the measurement of time delays in gravitational lens systems . unlike local determinations of hubble s constant ( e.g. freedman et al . 2001 ) , the cosmological nature of gravitational lenses means that they are more sensitive to the underlying cosmological parameters .",

    "while there has been a resurgence in quintessence cosmology , the generalized cosmological equations for such universes were presented more than a decade ago by linder ( 1988a;1988b ) , including a generalized form of the dyer - roeder equation for the evolution of a bundle of rays traveling from a distant source ( dyer & roeder 1973 ) . expressing the angular diameter distance as @xmath16 , the generalized beam equation is given by @xmath17\\dot{r } + \\sum_w   \\frac{3 r ( 1+w)\\alpha_w(z)\\omega_w(z)}{2(1+z)^2 }   = 0   \\label{linder}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the density , in units of the critical density @xmath19 , of a contributor to the total energy - density of the universe with an equation of state @xmath20 , and where @xmath3 is its pressure and @xmath4 is its density .",

    "here , @xmath24 is a generalized form of the hubble parameter and is given by ; @xmath25^\\frac{1}{2 } \\label{hubble}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , is related to the overall curvature of the universe .",
    "@xmath28 is a generalized form of the deceleration parameter and is given by @xmath29 finally , equation  [ linder ] also contains the parameter @xmath30 which represents how much of the fluid lies in the beam and influences the the evolution of a ray bundle . for a universe containing matter , the solution to equation  [ linder ] with @xmath31 represents the classic dyer - roeder ` filled beam ' distance , while @xmath32 is the ` empty beam ' distance ( dyer & roeder 1973 ) .    when solving equation  [ linder ] , the boundary conditions need to be defined .",

    "filled - beam distances @xmath34 are employed .",
    "refsdal ( 1964 ) was the first to note that cosmological parameters could be determined from the measurement of a time delay between the relative paths taken by light though a gravitational lens system .",
    "since the discovery of multiply - imaged quasars , this has become the goal of a number of monitoring campaigns ( e.g. cohen et al .",
    "2000 ; oscoz et al . 2001 ; patnaik & narashima 2001 ) , although these analyses are frustrated by degeneracies in the derived mass models .",
    "the cosmological model simply enters the determination of hubble s constant ; @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the normalized angular diameter distances between and observer @xmath37 , lens @xmath38 and source @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the measured time delay between an image pair .",
    "giovi & amendola ( 2001 ) examined the influence on a quintessence component on gravitational lens time delays and the determination of hubble s constant .",
    "their analysis , however , was mainly concerned with the influence of the clumping of material and the dependence on @xmath14 of whether distances are empty - beam or full - beam . here , a different approach is considered ; solving equation  [ linder ] , equation  [ hubbletime ] is evaluated for a range of quintessence components . for the study ,",
    "the redshifts of the lens and source in seven gravitational lens systems that are favourable for time delay measures were considered [ table  2 in giovi & amendola ( 2001 ) , q0957 + 561 and b1608 + 656 ] , plus two fiducial redshift pairs of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "while there are currently no lensed systems with established time delays at these particular redshifts , there are several potential systems ; e.g. the quadruple lens h1413 + 117 at a redshift of 2.55 , with a lens redshift , established from prominent absorption features , at @xmath43 and he1104 - 1805 at a redshift of 2.31 and an estimated lens redshift of @xmath44 .",

    ".[table1 ] the minima for the curves in figure  [ fig1 ] for the various cosmologies under consideration . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig5 ] presents the results of undertaking this procedure for various samples of gravitational lens systems .",
    "the left panel presents the probability distribution for the quintessence equation of state @xmath13 while the right hand panel is the corresponding distribution in hubble s constants ; note that all the distributions have been normalized to a peak value of one .",
    "the top row is for a sample of ten gravitational lens systems , akin to the situation today , followed by 50 , 100 and 500 systems .",
    "ten thousand realizations were undertaken for each sample size .",
    "each line on the plot corresponds to a different level of uncertainty in the gravitational lens time delay as outlined in the previous paragraph .",
    "clearly today , where there are but a handful of gravitational lens systems for which we have determined the time delay , with overall uncertainties exceeding 5 - 10% , then the resultant hubble s constant and @xmath13 that can be derived from the sample are unlikely to accurately represent the underlying values .",
    "table  [ table3 ] presents the 95% confidence interval for the estimation of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the various samples . increasing the sample size",
    "greatly improves the situation , although even with 500 lenses and 15% noise , the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not strongly constrained .",
    "one is led to conclude , therefore , that a large sample of lenses with very accurately determined time delays and lens models is required to significantly determine the the underlying cosmological parameters . given the observational effort in such a task , other approaches to probing the cosmological equation of state are likely to prove more fruitful .",
    "given this , the analysis was not extended to consider the smaller influences of quintessence evolution ( see section  [ evolve ] ) .",
    "can the current observations of time delays in gravitational lens systems tell us anything about the equation of state of the quintessence component ? in recent years , dedicated monitoring of a number of lensed systems has provided accurate @xmath46 time delay determinations ( e.g. fassnacht et al .",
    "1999 ; koopmans et al . 2000 ) .",
    "an examination of the hubble s constant derived from such studies reveals that , typically , it is less than the value determined from local studies , even accounting for standard cosmological differences ( e.g. impey et al . 1998 ; koopmans et al .",
    "2001 ; winn et al .",
    "this very question was also recently addressed by kochanek ( 2002 ) who suggests that this discrepancy is potentially due to galaxies possessing concentrated dark matter halos with a constant mass - to - light ratios , at odds with expectations from cold dark matter structure models . here , an alternative solution is considered .    examining the panel in figure  1 corresponding to an @xmath47 cosmology",
    ", it is apparent that choosing @xmath48 ( equivalent to setting @xmath6 ) results in almost the lowest possible determination of @xmath14 .",
    "considering a cosmology with a classical cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) increases the determined value of @xmath14 by @xmath49 ( dependent upon the source and lens redshifts ) , but as noted above , the currently determined values still tend to lie below the 72@xmath50 derived locally ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) . assuming that the gravitational lens models are correct , one way to reach concordance between the two approaches is that @xmath15 ; such a conclusion is consistent with the recently derived limit of @xmath51 from an analysis of a combination of cosmic microwave background , high redshift supernovae , cluster abundances and large scale structure data ( wang et al .",
    "2000 ; bean & melchiorri 2001 ) .",
    "while tantalizing , however , it must be conceded that the current differences in the approaches are not statistically significant , especially given the relatively large uncertainty in the modeling of gravitational lens mass distributions ( see , for example , the range of @xmath14 values obtained from the modeling of pg 1115 + 080 ; kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "given a large sample of gravitational lens systems , however , the determination of a systematic difference in the derived hubble s constant could be made .",
    "this paper has investigated the role of a quintessence component on angular diameter distances , specifically their influence on the determination of hubble s constant from the measurement of a time delay in multiply imaged quasars .    for flat universes , with an unevolving quintessence component , its seen that , for a gravitational lens system in which the time delay has been measured , the resultant hubble s constant is dependent upon the value of the equation of state parameter @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , the dependence of the determined value of the hubble s constant as a function of @xmath13 possesses a minimum which is independent on the lens and source redshift .",
    "several models of evolving quintessence were also examined , consisting of a linear evolution of the equation of state with redshift .",
    "the cosmologies resulted in significantly different forms of the angular diameter distance .",
    "hence , our view of the cosmos would be different in the various cosmologies .",
    "when considering the specific combination of angular diameter distances that constitute the cosmological contribution to the gravitational lensing determination of hubble s constant , it is seen that the resulting variations between cosmologies is very small , a matter of only a few percent , relative to an unevolving case with the same present day constitution .",
    "a number of monte carlo simulations of the determination of hubble s constant and the quintessence equation of state , @xmath13 , were undertaken to explore the efficacy of this approach .",
    "these revealed that the present situation with only a handful of lensed systems does not allow an accurate determination of the cosmic equation of state , and that at least an order of magnitude more lenses are truly required to provide a reasonably robust determination of the underlying cosmology .",
    "the next generation of all - sky surveys are presently underway ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey ) or are being planned ( e.g. vista , prime ) , and these datasets will greatly increase the number of lensed quasars available for monitoring studies .",
    "cooray & huterer ( 1999 ) estimate that @xmath52 lensed quasars will be identified from the sdss database alone , and a much larger number can be expected from the deeper vista and prime surveys .",
    "the number of these sources amenable for follow - up monitoring campaigns will naturally be much smaller , but one can confidently expect a sample of several hundred systems to eventually become available .",
    "however , given the effort required to first find such systems , as well as monitor them to determine the time delays and the modeling procedure , it is likely that @xmath13 will be first determined using one of the other various techniques currently being proposed .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that gravitational lens time delays are likely to prove poor probes of the universal equation of state .",
    "the anonymous referee is thanked for comments that improved the paper .",
