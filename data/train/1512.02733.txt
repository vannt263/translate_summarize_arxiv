    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies sets the rate at which galaxies grow and evolve and is the one of the most important measures for understanding the hierarchical build - up of our universe over cosmic time .",
    "large scale simulations , however , have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore some process ( or processes ) must be able to stop , or `` quench , ''",
    "star formation before the galaxy grows to be too big .",
    "the answer seems to lie in supermassive black holes ( smbh ) which nearly all massive galaxies harbor in their centers .",
    "smbhs grow through accretion of cold material ( active galactic nuclei ; agn ) , and the huge loss of gravitational energy of the cold material is converted into radiation that is evident across the whole electromagnetic spectrum and manifests itself as a bright point source in the nucleus of galaxies .",
    "the agn can deposit this energy into the ism of its host galaxy through jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or powerful outflows that either heat the gas or remove it altogether , i.e. `` feedback '' processes ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    indirect evidence of this `` feedback '' has been observed through the simple , scaling relationships between the mass of the smbh and different properties of the host galaxy such as the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge , the bulge mass , and the bulge luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the relative tightness of these relationships suggests a strong coevolution of the host galaxy and smbh .",
    "much debate remains however as to the exact mechanism of agn feedback and whether or not it plays a dominant role in the overall evolution of galaxies especially in light of new observations at both low and high @xmath5 that seem to deviate from the well - established relationships ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed review ) .",
    "evidence for agn feedback though should also manifest itself in the sfr of its host galaxy , therefore much work has also focused on the so - called starburst - agn connection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "well - calibrated indicators , such as h@xmath6 emission and uv luminosity , are significantly , if not completely , contaminated by the central agn .",
    "many studies therefore turn to the infrared ( ir ) regime ( @xmath7 @xmath1 m ) where dust re - emits the stellar light from young stars .",
    "dust fills the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies and plays an important part in the heating and cooling of the ism and the general physics of the galaxy . while dust contributes very little to the overall mass of a galaxy ( @xmath8 ) , the radiative output , mainly in the infrared ( ir ) regime , can ,",
    "on average , constitute roughly half of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy @xcite , although there is an enormous range in the fraction .",
    "dust efficiently absorbs optical and uv emission and re - radiates it in the mid- and far - infrared ( mir , fir ) depending on the temperature as well as grain size @xcite .",
    "recently formed o and b stars produce the majority of the optical and uv light in galaxies , therefore measuring the total ir light from dust provides insights into the current ( @xmath9 myr ) star formation rate ( sfr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although for very passive galaxies where the current sfr is much lower than it was earlier , ir emission can be an overestimate due to dust heating by an older stellar population.(e.g .",
    "* )    however , dust is also the key component in obscuring our view of agn .",
    "dust heated by the agn is thought to primarily live in a toroidal - like structure that encircles the agn and absorbs its radiative output for certain lines of sight .",
    "the dusty torus is used to explain the dichotomy of agn into seyfert 1 ( sy 1 ) and seyfert 2 ( sy 2 ) within a unified model @xcite .",
    "like o and b stars in star - forming regions , the agn outputs heavy amounts of optical and uv light , and like dust in the ism the dusty torus absorbs and re - emits this as ir radiation .",
    "spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models @xcite as well as observations @xcite suggest the torus mainly emits in the mir ( @xmath10 @xmath1 m ) with the flux density dropping rapidly in the fir ( @xmath11 @xmath1 m ) .",

    "this makes sense within the context of multiple temperature components .",
    "photometry from nearby wavelengths should be produced from closely related temperature components .",
    "the weak correlation between 70 and 500 @xmath1 m indicates the emission in these wavebands does not originate from closely related processes .",
    "70 @xmath1 m emission comes from much hotter and smaller dust grains than 500 @xmath1 m and several processes could provide an explanation . since this is an agn sample , there could be a strong contribution from agn heated dust at 70 @xmath1 m , whereas at 500 @xmath1 m , agn related emission would likely be negligible .",
    "this is supported by our findings in @xcite where we showed that the 70 @xmath1 m luminosity is weakly correlated with agn luminosity .",
    "further , in @xcite we found that the bat agn morphologies at 70 @xmath1 m were concentrated in the nucleus potentially indicating an agn contribution .",
    "the weak correlation , however , can also be explained if non - star - forming processes also contribute to the 500 @xmath1 m emission .",
    "while in non - agn galaxies , the majority of 70 @xmath1 m emission is most likely due to small , stochastically heated dust grains around hii regions , @xmath31 @xmath1 m emission is likely produced by the heating of larger dust grains in the diffuse ism by older stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the disconnect between the stellar populations would produce significant scatter in the correlation between 70 and 500 @xmath1 m .",
    "a third possibility is that synchrotron radiation produced by radio jets associated with agn can contribute to the fir , especially the longest wavelengths as seen in some radio - loud galaxies @xcite .",
    "this non - thermal emission would be completely unrelated to the thermal emission at 70 @xmath1 m , thereby producing a weaker correlation between the luminosities at those wavebands . in a later section",
    "we will show there are indeed some radio - loud sources in our sample where synchrotron emission dominates the spire emission , although the fraction of sources is quite low .",
    "when we break the sample down into sy 1 s and 2 s we do not find much difference between the correlation coefficients .",
    "this shows that sy 1 s and 2 s are not different in terms of their overall fir emission and the same processes are likely producing the fir emission .",
    "sy 1 s do show a slightly weaker correlation between the _ herschel _ luminosities especially the ones involving 500 @xmath1 m .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that most radio - loud agn are classified as sy 1 s so synchrotron emission is contributing strongest at 500 @xmath1 m compared to the other wavebands .",

    "ultra - hard x - ray luminosity directly probes the current strength of the agn because it likely originates very close to the smbh .",
    "the 14195 kev luminosity then provides an unambiguous measure of the agn power especially for compton - thin sources .",
    "if we want to determine whether the agn contributes in any way to the fir luminosity , the first check would be to correlate the 14195 kev luminosity with each waveband s luminosity .",
    "@xcite ran correlation tests for the pacs wavebands finding a weak , but statistically significant correlation between the 70 and 160 @xmath1 m luminosity and the 14195 kev luminosity for sy 1 s but not for sy 2 s .    using the same methods as we did to measure strengths of the correlations between each _ herschel _ luminosity , we measured the correlation between each spire and 14195 kev luminosity .",
    "the last lines of each section of table  [ tab : wave_corrs ] lists the results of the correlation tests and figure  [ fig : lum_spire_bat ] plots the correlations with gray arrows indicating upper limits .    for the agn sample as a whole , no significant correlation exists between the spire and 14195 kev luminosity .",
    "all of the @xmath33 , after accounting for the partial correlation with distance , are below 0.1 with @xmath34 either at or above 5% .",
    "however , when we break the sample up into sy 1 s and sy 2 s and redo the correlation tests , we find a very weak correlation between the 250 and 350 @xmath1 m luminosity and ultra - hard x - ray luminosity for sy 1 s only ( @xmath35 and 0.10 ) .",
    "sy 2 s @xmath33 are consistent with no correlation with @xmath36 for all three wavebands .",
    "this continues the trend with what was found in @xcite where only sy 1 s were found to have a weak correlation between the bat luminosity and the pacs waveband luminosities .",
    "the partial correlation coefficients were @xmath37 and @xmath38 for sy 1s and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for sy 2 s at 70 and 160 @xmath1 m respectively ( see table 3 of * ? ? ? * ) * * * * .",
    "we note however that except for the 70 @xmath1 m waveband , none of the correlation coefficients are @xmath41 away from a null correlation coefficient .",
    "so even though @xmath42 , these are all quite weak correlations between the _ herschel _ wavebands and bat luminosity for sy 1 s . at 500 @xmath1 m , the correlation completely disappears .",
    "as we discuss in @xcite , this extends the trend observed in the mir where strong correlations have been measured between the 9 , 12 , and 18 @xmath1 m luminosities and the bat luminosity @xcite but moving towards longer wavelengths the correlation degrades rapidly as shown in @xcite for 90 @xmath1 m emission .",
    "clearly then , at long wavelengths ( @xmath43 @xmath1 m ) , emission from dust unrelated to the agn dominates most galaxies .",
    "however , we must still explain why sy 1 s retain a weak correlation while sy 2 s do not .",
    "@xcite discussed in detail several theories for why sy 1 s would show a different correlation between the _ herschel _ luminosities and bat luminosity .",
    "these included an intrinsically different bat luminosity distribution for sy 1 s and sy 2 s and the addition of compton - thick ( ct ) agn in the sy 2 sample .",
    "several authors have found that the sy 2 luminosity function breaks at a significantly lower luminosity than for sy 1s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low bat luminosity ,",
    "then , there are more sy 2 s than sy 1 s as is evident in figure  [ fig : lum_spire_bat ] .",
    "@xcite showed that at low agn luminosity the correlation between sfr and agn luminosity flattens .",
    "this can be explained one of two ways : 1 . ) only at high agn luminosity is there a direct connection between star formation and agn activity .",
    "2 . ) at high agn luminosity , the ir - related agn emission overwhelms any star - forming related ir emission even at long wavelengths .",
    "regardless of the physical reason , the flattening of the sf - agn relationship at low luminosity could explain the correlation differences seen between sy 1s and sy 2s since sy 2s are preferentially found at lower luminosity than sy 1s .",
    "@xcite tested this for the pacs wavebands and found that only using high luminosity objects did not improve the x - ray - to - ir correlation for sy 2 s .",
    "we repeated this test with the spire luminosities and limited the samples to only agn with bat luminosity greater than @xmath44 ergs s@xmath20 . for both sy 1 s and sy 2 s",
    "the correlations become insignificant , likely because of the reduction in number of sources used in the analysis .",
    "it is then inconclusive whether or not a difference in intrinsic agn luminosity is the cause of the differences in correlations between x - ray and ir luminosity for sy 1 s and sy 2 s .",
    "the other possibility is that ct sources are contaminating the sy 2 sample .",
    "this would have an effect if the high column density ( @xmath45 @xmath27 ) material obscuring the agn scatters 14 - 195 kev photons out of our line sight causing a lower measured bat luminosity .",
    "@xcite identified 44 either confirmed ct agn or likely ct agn based on x - ray hardness ratios in our sample .",
    "we removed these likely ct sources and redid the correlation tests , finding no difference from before just as @xcite found .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that ct sources are the cause of the difference between the sy 1 and sy 2 correlations .",
    "given the inconclusiveness of the first test limiting the sample to high luminosity objects , we can only speculate about the reason for the difference in correlations .",
    "however , @xcite did find that restricting the sample to high luminosity objects increased the strength of the correlation for sy 1 s but not sy 2 s in the pacs wavebands .",
    "it is possible then that either a direct physical link between the sfr and agn luminosity that is only evident in high luminosity agn or increased contamination of the agn to the ir sed is causing the relatively stronger correlation in sy 1s but not sy 2s .",
    "what is conclusive is that the spire emission from the agn host galaxies on average is not strongly contaminated by agn - related emission given the small values for the correlation coefficients even for sy 1 s .      while in the previous sections , we examined the absolute luminosities of each spire waveband and the correlations between each other and other wavebands ( pacs and bat ) , in this section we examine the spire colors ( i.e. flux ratios ) .",
    "colors in general provide measures of the shape of the sed .",
    "different objects and mechanisms produce significantly different sed shapes across the same wavelength regime , therefore colors can be used to separate distinct populations from each other especially when groups display the same absolute brightnesses .",
    "we investigate two colors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that probe the rayleigh jeans tail of a modified blackbody if the dominant process producing the emission is cold dust .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] plots the kde of the two colors .",
    "the top row compares the distribution of the colors ( @xmath2 on the left and @xmath3 on the right ) from the bat agn and hrs samples .",
    "while the hrs galaxies are local like the bat agn , one major difference is the stellar mass distribution .",
    "the hrs sample contains more low stellar mass galaxies while the bat agn are strictly found in galaxies with stellar mass ( @xmath46 ) values above @xmath47 m@xmath48 @xcite .    as @xcite",
    "show , fir colors can be affected by the physical properties of the galaxy , especially the colors probing the cold dust such as the ones we are investigating here . therefore , we broke the hrs sample into two groups , a high mass group ( @xmath49 m@xmath48 ) and low mass one ( @xmath49 m@xmath48 ) indicated in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] by the solid and dashed green lines .",
    "stellar masses for the hrs were obtained from @xcite .",
    "we also plot the theoretical color of the modified blackbody with a dust temperature of 20 k and emissivity ( @xmath50 ) of 2.0 and 1.5 , values typical of normal , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the hrs high mass group and bat agn display nearly identical color distributions for both colors whereas the hrs low mass group is skewed toward lower colors . results of a k - s test show that the hrs high mass group and bat agn colors are drawn from the same parent population with a @xmath51 and 22% for @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . on the other hand",
    "the hrs low mass group colors are significantly different from the bat agn with @xmath52 values much less than 1% .",
    "this is consistent with what was found in @xcite , who showed that the spire colors for the hrs sample were affected by the metallicity of the galaxy with metal rich galaxies displaying larger flux ratios and a higher @xmath50 than metal poor ones .",
    "given the strong , positive relationship between metallicity and @xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is exactly in line with what is seen in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] . the hrs high mass group and bat agn display colors closer to the ones expected for a modified blackbody with @xmath53 while the low mass hrs group are closer to @xmath54 .            in figure",
    "[ fig : color - color ] we plot both colors together for the hrs and bat agn .",
    "nearly all of the hrs galaxies are concentrated along a main locus as well as many of the bat agn .",
    "we also plot the expected colors for a modified blackbody with varying temperature between 10 and 60 k and an emissivity of either 2.0 ( green line and squares ) or 1.5 ( purple line and diamonds ) . each square or diamond represents an increase of 5 k starting at 10 k in the lower left .",
    "the main locus for both samples is clearly aligned with a modified blackbody with temperatures between 1530 k. @xcite fit the fir sed of the hrs sample using a single temperature modified blackbody finding exactly this range of temperatures and an average emissivity of 1.8 .",
    "further these values are consistent with dust in the milky way , andromeda , and other nearby galaxies @xcite .      in the bottom rows ,",
    "we compare sy 1 s and sy 2 s .",
    "based on the results of our analysis in section  [ sec : det_rate_lum_dist ] , we would expect sy 1 s and sy 2 s to show the same distribution of colors .",
    "indeed this is the case as both distributions in both colors peak at nearly the same values and have nearly the same spread .",
    "k - s tests reveal the colors for the two seyfert types are drawn from the same parent population with @xmath55 for @xmath2 and @xmath56 for @xmath3 .      while the bulk of the spire colors are very similar between the hrs and bat , and the two seyfert types , one noticeable difference is a distinct bump in the color distribution around 0.75 .",
    "this bump is absent in the hrs sample and mainly is made up of sy 1s . with both flux ratios less than one , this indicates a monotonically rising sed that is in stark contrast with the rapidly declining sed characteristic of a modified blackbody .",
    "the equation for a modified blackbody is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the standard planck blackbody function with a temperature of @xmath59 .",
    "the bump seen in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] is very evident in figure  [ fig : color - color ] as a separate population in the lower left - hand corner .",
    "specifically 6 bat agn and one hrs galaxy occupy the region of color - color space where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "based on the theoretical curves , these exceptional colors can not be explained as either a different temperature or emissivity .",
    "rather an entirely different process is producing the fir emission in these galaxies and since the colors indicate essentially a rising sed , we suspected synchrotron radiation as the likely emission mechanism with its characteristic increasing power law shape with wavelength .",
    "further there seems to be a horizontal spread in the distribution of the bat agn in figure  [ fig : color - color ] that is clearly not evident in the hrs .",
    "also this effect is not seen figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] and the kdes because it only becomes evident when analyzing the two colors together .",
    "both samples span the same range of colors , however their distribution in color - color space is different .",
    "this is characterized by a large group of bat agn above and to the left of the main locus and @xmath62 line ( purple ) as well as a smaller group of agn below and to the right of the main locus and @xmath63 line ( green ) .",
    "the latter group can be explained simply from a decrease in temperature and increase in emissivity up to a beta value of 3.0 ( cyan line in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] ) , indicating the prevalence of large amounts of cold dust .",
    "the former group could be explained by a decrease in the emissivity closer to around values of 1.0 ( gray line ) , however this would require the dust temperature to increase to values above 60 k , not typical of regular star - forming galaxies .",
    "rather these high temperatures ( 70100 k ) are near the expected temperatures for dust heated by the agn , which show characteristic peaks in their sed between 2040 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "if the agn is affecting the colors of these sources more than the ones on the main locus then there should be some correlation between the offset from the main locus and an indicator of agn strength such as x - ray luminosity .",
    "to quantify the offset from the main locus , we fit the sed of all of the sources in figure  [ fig : color - color ] using a modified blackbody ( eq .  [ eq : mod_blackbody ] ) with a fixed emissivity of 2.0 to measure the excess or deficiency of observed 500 @xmath1 m emission compared to the model .    with the emissivity fixed at 2.0 ,",
    "there are only two free parameters , the dust temperature and normalization .",
    "we fit the sources within a bayesian framework using uniform priors for the logarithm of the normalization and dust temperature and a standard gaussian likelihood function . to sample the posterior probability density function , we use the ` emcee ` package @xcite that implements the affine - invariant ensemble sampler for markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "for the model fitting , we only use 160 , 250 , and 350 @xmath1 m flux densities .",
    "we exclude the 500 @xmath1 m data point because our aim is to compare the expected 500 @xmath1 m emission from the model with the observed one and do not want the fitting influenced by the observed emission .",
    "we also exclude the 70 @xmath1 m flux density because it can be dominated by emission from hotter dust heated by young stars in dense star - forming regions or the agn itself @xcite .",
    "each sample from the mcmc chain contains values for the parameters of the modified blackbody that are likely given the posterior distribution . from all of these parameters",
    ", we calculated 40000 modeled 500 @xmath1 m emission and `` excess '' using the following equation : @xmath64 @xmath4 then represents a fractional excess ( or deficiency ) as compared to the model emission .",
    "a deficiency would be indicated by a negative value for @xmath4 . the final excess value associated with the source",
    "is then determined as the median of all of the excess values . in figure",
    "[ fig : color - color_excess ] we plot the same color - color diagram as in figure  [ fig : color - color ] with each point colored by its measured @xmath4 .        in general",
    ", points with low values of the @xmath3 color show high values of @xmath4 and vice versa for high values of the @xmath3 color .",
    "points along the main locus are scattered around @xmath65 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 can quantify a source s distance from the main locus and allows us to study possible causes for this excess emission at 500 @xmath1 m .",
    "we first measure the correlation between @xmath4 and radio loudness .",
    "agn historically have been classified into two groups based on how bright their radio emission is compared to another waveband , usually optical .",
    "these groups are `` radio - loud '' and `` radio - quiet '' agn with the former group showing bright radio emission and the latter faint radio emission relative to the optical or x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "while originally radio - loud and radio - quiet agn seemed to form a dichotomy , the consensus now seems to be that there is a broad distribution of radio - loudness rather than a bimodality @xcite .",
    "further , the original radio loudness parameter , @xmath66 which measured the ratio of the radio to optical luminosity , was shown to underestimate the radio loudness especially for low - luminosity seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "rather @xmath67 which measures the nuclear radio to x - ray luminosity ratio was confirmed to be a better radio - loudness indicator given x - rays are less affected by obscuration and contamination from the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , for the bat agn , we use @xmath68 to measure the radio - loudness with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    for @xmath71",
    "we first cross - correlated the bat agn with the first and nvss databases which provide 1.4 ghz flux densities over all of the northern sky .",
    "first flux densities were preferred over nvss due to the much better angular resolution ( 5 `` vs. 45 '' ) . since _",
    "swift_/bat was an all - sky survey , nearly half of the bat agn were not included in either first or nvss . for these southern sources we turned to the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ? * ) which surveyed the southern sky at 843 mhz .",
    "finally , for the remaining sources missing radio data , we performed a literature search and found 5 ghz fluxes from various other studies @xcite . to convert all flux densities to 1.4 ghz",
    ", we assumed a power - law spectrum , @xmath72 , that is typical for synchrotron emission .        figure  [ fig : excess_vs_rx ] plots @xmath73 against @xmath68 to test our hypothesis that the excess 500 @xmath1 m emission is related to the radio loudness of the agn .",
    "in the left panel we plot all of the sources together to show the full range of @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , the six agn with the largest values of @xmath73 exhibit high values of radio loudness ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "these six agn are hb 890241 + 622 , 2masx j23272195 + 1524375 , 3c 111.0 , 3c 120 , pictor a , and pks 2331 - 240 and all are well known radio - loud agn .",
    "they correspond to the six sources in figures  [ fig : color - color ] and [ fig : color - color_excess ] that lie in the lower left hand corner .",
    "further , the lone hrs galaxy seen in figure  [ fig : color - color ] among the six bat agn is the radio galaxy m87 , whose jets and radio activity have been studied extensively . based on this , we prescribe color cutoffs that can easily separate radio - loud agn from radio - quiet agn and normal star - forming galaxies : @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see dashed lines in figure  [ fig : color - color_excess ] ) .",
    "while radio - loudness can explain the most extreme values of @xmath73 , it does not explain the more moderate ones .",
    "in the right panel of figure  [ fig : excess_vs_rx ] , we zoom in on the agn with @xmath75 .",
    "visually there does not appear to be any strong correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath73 and the spearman rank correlation coefficient between them is -0.15 , weak and in the opposite sense of what would be expected if synchrotron emission was contaminating the 500 @xmath1 m emission .    to explore even further",
    ", we analyzed the correlations between @xmath73 and two agn - related indicators , the _ swift_/bat luminosity , @xmath76 , and the 3.4 to 4.6 @xmath1 m flux ratio ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the 3.4 ( @xmath78 ) and 4.6 ( @xmath79 ) @xmath1 m fluxes for the bat agn were obtained from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allwise catalog accessed through the _ nasa / ipac _ infrared science archive ( irsa )",
    ". details of the compilation of _ wise _ fluxes for the bat agn will be available in an upcoming publication ( shimizu et al . in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath76 can be used as a measure of the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the agn , unaffected by host galaxy contamination or line - of - sight absorption .",
    "@xmath77 has been shown to be an effective discriminator between agn - dominated and normal star - forming galaxies that has both high reliability and completeness @xcite in magnitude units for selecting agn . in flux units",
    "this changes to @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite also show that as the fraction of emission coming from the host galaxy increases @xmath77 increases as well making it a good measure of the relative contribution of the agn to the infrared luminosity .",
    "[ fig : excess_vs_agn ] shows the relationships between both @xmath81 ( left panel ) and @xmath77 ( right panel ) with @xmath73 after removing the six radio - loud agn .",
    "both parameters display noticeable correlations with @xmath73 with @xmath81 positively correlated and @xmath77 negatively correlated .",
    "we calculated spearman rank correlation coefficients finding values of 0.49 and -0.49 respectively .",
    "pearson correlation coefficients are 0.30 and -0.50 respectively reflecting the more linear relationship between @xmath73 and @xmath77 than the one between @xmath73 and @xmath81 .",
    "all correlations have a probability of a null correlation less than 0.01% . in the right panel",
    "we also plot the @xcite cutoff for agn - dominated galaxies where values to the left of this line indicate agn - dominated colors .",
    "both panels indicate that the strength of the agn in the host galaxy is possibly having an effect on the spire colors .",
    "a stronger agn in relation to the host galaxy is causing deviations from a standard modified blackbody in the form of a small but noticeable 500 @xmath1 m offset .    without longer wavelength data ,",
    "however , its impossible to determine the exact cause of the 500 @xmath1 m excess so we can only speculate . submillimeter excess emission has been observed in a number of objects including dwarf and normal star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the small and large magellanic clouds @xcite and even our own milky way @xcite .",
    "various explanations have been proposed including the presence of a very cold ( @xmath82 k ) component @xcite , grain coagulation that causes the emissivity to increase for colder temperatures @xcite , fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and an increase in magnetic material in the ism @xcite .",
    "while all of these explanations are certainly still possible to explain the excess seen in the bat agn , they lack any direct connection to the strength of the agn .",
    "further , a key result from all of the previous work is that the submillimeter excess is more prevalent in very metal - poor galaxies ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "all of the bat agn reside in high stellar mass galaxies @xcite and given the mass - metallicity relationship @xcite should also be quite metal rich .    rather , we speculate the excess is related to radio emission more closely associated with the agn itself .",
    "several studies of the radio properties of agn have revealed a millimeter excess around 100 ghz @xcite that is likely due to either an inverted or flat sed between cm and mm wavelengths . because @xcite found the excess mainly in low luminosity agn similar to sgr a * , they invoked advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) that produce compact nuclear jets to explain the inverter or flat seds",
    ". however the sample of @xcite was composed of x - ray bright agn including high eddington ratio ( @xmath84 , a measure of the accretion rate relative to the eddington limit ) sources where an adaf is unlikely .",
    "@xcite instead use the radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratio to argue that the high - frequency radio emission originates near the x - ray corona of the accretion disk given the ratio s similarity to that found for stellar coronal mass ejections ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the compact nature of the radio emission .",
    "magnetic activity around the accretion disk in the core of the agn would then be responsible for the excess and if magnetic activity increases with @xmath84 , this could explain the relationship seen with @xmath81 as well as @xmath77 .",
    "this strengthens the need for a more comprehensive survey of agn in the mm wavelength range as it could clearly reveal interesting physics possibly occurring near the accretion disk .",
    "we have produced the _",
    "herschel_/spire maps for 313 agn selected from the _",
    "swift_/bat 58 month catalog in three wavebands : 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 m . combined with the pacs photometry from @xcite , the spire flux densities presented in this paper form the complete fir seds for a large , nearby , and relatively unbiased sample of agn .",
    "we used two methods for measuring the flux densities : timeline fitting for point sources and aperture photometry for extended and undetected sources .",
    "we summarize below the results of our statistical analysis and comparison to the _ herschel _ reference survey sample of normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "* sy 2s are detected at a higher rate than sy 1s , and after accounting for upper limits , sy 2 s have slightly higher spire luminosities than sy 1 s . however the effect is small and indicates that on average , the global fir properties of agn are independent of orientation . * using a partial correlation survival analysis to account for the luminosity - distance effect and upper limits , we find all of the _ herschel _ luminosities are correlated with each other suggesting the process ( or processes ) producing the emission from 70500 @xmath1 m is connected .",
    "luminosities with the smallest wavelength difference ( i.e. 160 and 250 @xmath1 m ) are much more correlated than pairs further apart ( i.e. 70 and 500 @xmath1 m ) , in agreement with different temperature components associated with different wavebands . while this could point to the agn affecting the shorter wavebands more than the longer ones and increasing the scatter , it can also be explained by an increased contribution from older stellar populations to the emission at longer wavelengths . *",
    "none of the spire luminosities are well correlated with the 14195 kev luminosity , a proxy for the bolometric agn luminosity .",
    "the agn , in general , is unlikely to be strongly affecting either the 250 , 350 , or 500 @xmath1 m emission , however sy 1s do show a very weak correlation at 250 and 350 @xmath1 m . removing ct sources does not improve the correlation for sy 2 s .",
    "it remains to be seen what the exact explanation is for the difference in correlations between sy 1s and sy 2s but possible explanations include a direct link between star - formation and agn luminosity that is evident only at high luminosity or increased contamination by the agn .",
    "* we compared the spire colors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the colors of the hrs galaxies .",
    "the bat agn have statistically similar spire color distributions as the high stellar mass ( @xmath85 m@xmath48 ) hrs galaxies .",
    "this further emphasizes that on average , the fir emission of agn host galaxies is likely produced by cold dust in the ism heated by stellar radiation just as in normal star - forming galaxies without an agn .",
    "* we did find anomalous colors for 6 bat agn with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the fir seds for these agn are dominated by synchrotron emission from a radio jet rather than thermally heated dust . *",
    "another group of agn with less anomalous colors but still removed from the main locus were analyzed by fitting the seds with a modified blackbody and calculating a 500 @xmath1 m excess .",
    "we found the 500 @xmath1 m excess is not related to radio loudness , but is well correlated with the 14195 kev luminosity and @xmath77 ( 3.4/4.6 @xmath1 m ) color from _",
    "wise_. we speculate this is possibly related to the millimeter excess emission recently seen in agn caused by coronal emission above the accretion disk .",
    "future work will focus on combining the photometry from @xcite and this paper as well as archival data to perform detailed sed modeling to investigate the local starburst - agn connection and the agn contribution to the fir .",
