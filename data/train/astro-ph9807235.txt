    "box 299 , 2200 ag noordwijk , the netherlands + @xmath11 universities space research association , huntsville , al 35800 +      the x - ray ( 2 - 20 kev ) phenomenology of galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) has been widely studied ( see and for recent reviews ) .",
    "the bhcs have many similarities in their phenomenology , in that similar x - ray spectral hardnesses are accompanied by similar fast - timing behavior ( 0.01 - 100 hz ) . often , it is this similarity of behavior alone which identifies an individual x - ray source as a bhc , when this source has no measured mass - function , and it presents correlated x - ray spectral and timing behavior which is similar to that observed from bhcs which do have a ( high , 3 m@xmath12 ) measured mass - function .",
    "this x - ray phenomenology is largely composed of three `` states '' , historically tied to the observed source intensity , which has evolved to be tied to the source photon spectral hardness .",
    "the `` soft / high '' state ( hs ; historically , when the 1 - 10 kev source flux was high ) is marked by a soft photon spectrum dominated by an `` ultra - soft '' black - body component , with @xmath13 1 kev , and weak ( @xmath14 few % ) rms ( root - mean - square ) variability which is a power - law as a function of frequency , of slope @xmath14 1 .",
    "the `` hard / low '' state ( ls ) is marked by a hard photon spectrum dominated by a power - law component , and constant % rms below some frequency ( @xmath14 0.01 - 10 hz ) , decreasing roughly as a power - law above this frequency .",
    "the `` very high '' state ( vhs ) is marked by the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) with frequencies between 3 - 10 hz .",
    "in addition , an `` off '' state ( in which the source is quiescent ) is generally included in any phenomenology .",
    "more recently , an `` intermediate state '' ( is ; ) has been recognized , in which the variability is band - limited , constant below some break frequency ( @xmath15 hz ) and decreasing above this , while the energy spectrum shows both an ultra - soft black - body component and a power - law component @xmath1610 kev .",
    "the distinction made between this state and the hs and ls are the simultaneous presence of the ultra - soft and power - law energy spectral components , with band - limited broad - band noise ( bbn ) variability and ( in gs 1124 - 68 ) the presence of qpo at source fluxes below that of the so - called `` high state '' .    as a structure for phenomenologically characterizing bhcs ,",
    "the state paradigm lacks quantitative value .",
    "for example , cyg x-1 may be observed in the soft / high state .",
    "one might well ask , how high ?",
    "since `` high '' describes the observed flux , the uncertainty in distances to bhcs makes it difficult to inter - compare the behavior of objects on this basis .",
    "there currently exists no gradation of states , no formal quantitative test to determine if a particular source occupies a state or not , or `` how much '' it occupies a state .",
    "the description of additional `` states '' , without somehow tying them through some invariant observational parameter to other `` states '' does not illuminate the relationship between the various states .",
    "in addition , it seems reasonable that the bhcs do not occupy `` states '' at all , but that bhc behavior changes slowly as a function of its observables , since individual bhcs are observed to have a wide range of luminosities , spectral hardnesses and power density spectra , rather than three or four of these . as such ,",
    "investigating bhc behavior as a function of continual variables may be a useful observational approach .    in an individual source ,",
    "observational states are defined on the basis of qualitative changes in its power - spectrum and energy - spectrum , which are observed to be strongly correlated .",
    "it seems likely that the instantaneous accretion rate ( @xmath17 ) is the underlying variable parameter responsible for the observed changes in source behavior .",
    "however , between different sources , other parameters  such as the mass of the black hole , or the stellar type of its companion  may also come into play in determining the observed source intensity behavior .",
    "comparisons in behaviors between different objects therefore may eventually provide observational handles on these parameters .",
    "the combined use of color - color diagrams ( ccds ) and the contemporaneous timing behavior  usually indicated by the strength of source variability and its functional dependence on frequency in power density spectra ( pds )  has quite successfully revealed regularities in the complex qpo and bbn timing behavior of gs  1124 - 68 @xcite and gx  339 - 4 @xcite . following this work",
    ", it was found that in the vhs , in which the qpo are found , the pds ( apart from the qpo ) can be like those in the hard / low state , or like those in the soft / high @xcite . in a similar vein",
    ", it has been shown that , as the fraction of the total intensity due to the power - law spectral component increases above 10% , the % rms variability increases , as well @xcite ; the variability behavior of gs  1124 - 68 was demonstrated to be correlated to the strength of its hard - spectral - component , which had been long suspected .",
    "the ccd vs. fast - timing s approach was first used in x - ray astronomy to untangle correlated timing and spectral / intensity behavior of non - pulsing neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; ) .",
    "consequently , it has become clearer what the accretion rate is when the various distinct behaviors of these objects are observed . more detailed theory on the spectral and timing behavior has been produced , as well as proposals for the relationship between the behavior of neutron - star lmxbs and that of bhcs and pulsars ( , b ; see for review ) .    we have completed a study of the simultaneous spectral and timing behavior of ten bhcs observed with  ( ) .",
    "a description of bbn behavior of these sources is being presented elsewhere (;",
    "hereafter ) . here",
    ", we describe and discuss the spectral and energy dependence of qpo in the four sources which exhibit them in the  data ( gs  1124 - 68 , gx  339 - 4 , cyg  x-1 and gs  2000 + 25 ) and the strength and frequency dependence of the underlying bbn .",
    "these results are a summary of analyses presented in greater detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have examined the source spectral state , as characterized by its location on a ccd , and simultaneous timing properties .",
    "we find that bhcs show qpo typically when they have a spectral hardness ratio between the hard / low state and soft / high state .",
    "when we follow the timing behavior of the two objects which exhibit this qpo ( gx  339 - 4 and gs  1124 - 68 ) as a function of spectral hardness , changes in behavior of the qpo and the underlying bbn indicate that the so - called vhs is a transition between the hard / low state and the soft / high state .",
    "this has important implications for the origin of the qpo , as an indicator of this transition , perhaps being produced by interaction between two distinct physical processes responsible for the hs and ls phenomena .    an important note on terminology : historically , `` low state '' was applied to describe the behavior of bhcs when the source intensity was low , and `` high state '' for when it was high .",
    "we are faced with a descriptive problem , in that the behavior of the bhcs we describe herein  aside from intensity , and the presence of qpo  is indistinguishable from that observed from the `` low state '' , or the `` high state '' .",
    "it is a common aspect of theories of bhc accretion to ascribe the low state to one physical component , such as a geometrically thick accretion disk or a spherical corona , and the high state behavior to another , such as a geometrically thin accretion disk ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper we use the terms `` low state '' and `` high state '' not to indicate source intensity , but behavior which is ascribed to the respective physical components we mention above .",
    "all x - ray data on s ( bhcs ) in the present work were obtained with the large area counter ( ) on the the  satellite @xcite .",
    "the  on - board  had a geometric area of @xmath14 4000 cm@xmath5 , a nominal energy range of 1 - 37 kev , divided into 48 energy channels , with energy resolution of 18% @xmath19 . the time resolution of the data , depending on the data - acquisition mode , was typically between 0.001 - 16 sec .",
    "the data used in the ccd are described in detail elsewhere (; app .",
    "briefly , our data are drawn from all data acquired by  during observations of each of ten x - ray black hole candidates ( ) , which had energy resolution sufficient to produce our hardness ratios ( see also below ) .",
    "all data were corrected for background , deadtime , and aspect . following these corrections , we produced hardness ratios using three bands ",
    "the  ( 2.34.6 kev ) , the  ( 4.69.2 kev ) and the ( 9.218.4 kev ) .",
    "these bands were combined into the  (  / ) and the  (  / ) , which we use to produce the ccd .",
    "each point represents 128 seconds of contiguous integration time .",
    "only points which have error bars in both colors showing significantly measured hardness ratios ( @xmath164@xmath20 ) are shown ( the remainder are discarded ) .",
    "due to inadequate background subtraction , not all data acquired by  on a particular source is used in this ccd .",
    "thus , the ccd is biased against fainter intensities , for which either the background subtraction techniques employed or counting statistics in a 128-sec integration were inadequate .",
    "after all selections were applied , a total of 680 ksec ( of 1500 ksec ) of data from all sources were used in the ccd .",
    "the ccd is presented in sec .",

    "the effect of galactic absorption is minimized ( although not eliminated ) by using a high lower energy bound ( 2.3 kev ) .",

    "the effect of galactic absorption in the 2.3 - 4.6 kev energy range is small  for a black - body of kt=0.5 kev , the changes by @xmath2210% between 1.4 @xmath21 and 6.0 @xmath21 ; at 25 @xmath21 , this becomes a 30% effect in the 2.34.6 kev energy range .    throughout the present work",
    ", we refer to spectral `` states '' , typically as indicated by the contemporaneous  value . for brevity",
    ", we use a progression of letters ( a , b , c , d ... , j ) which indicate a range of  space , each half a decade wide in logarithmic space , increasing in sequence with increasingly hard spectrum ( a is @xmath23  @xmath24 , b is @xmath25  @xmath26 , etc . ) .",
    "the width of these ranges was arbitrarily chosen , with the idea that the source behavior does not vary significantly within a single range .",
    "this is not always the case , particularly when qpo are observed , and it then becomes necessary to further subdivide the data based on the spectral values into `` sub - states '' ( _ e.g. _  f1 , f2 , ... ) .",
    "however , the letters a - j , are retained for convenience in referencing the timing analysis to a simultaneous spectral indicator .      in table",
    "[ tab : timingdata ] , we show the quantity of data which are available to us for the timing study , separated by source and time resolution . in all ,",
    "853 ksec are available for the fast - timing analysis ; of this , 305 ksec have time resolution of or better than 0.06250 sec .",

    "the resulting frequency range is 0.12564 hz .      using raw data selected from those listed in table  [ tab : timingdata ] ( listed in greater detail in app .",
    "b of rutledge ) , we produced ffts in three separate energy bands : the  ( = 2.34.6 kev ) ,  ( = 4.69.2 kev ) , ( = 9.218.4 kev ) and in the summed  ( = 2.318.4 kev ) .",
    "this produced a library of low- , medium- , and high - frequency ffts in three independent photon energy ranges and one summed photon energy range from which we draw to produce pds , based on the selection criteria we apply for any given analysis .    to produce a composite pds ,",
    "individual ffts are selected by the , measured during the time period covered by the fft .",
    "each individual fft is made into a single pds , its calculated dead - time corrected poisson level subtracted , and the resulting power corrected for background and instrumental deadtime .",
    "finally , all the resulting pds are averaged together into a single pds . the uncertainty in the power at each frequency is taken to be the measured standard deviation in the power divided by the square root of the number of measurements .",
    "thus , the uncertainty in the power contains any ( non - biased ) systematic uncertainty in the poisson - subtraction , dead time and background % rms correction factors .",
    "these pds are logarithmically rebinned , and overlapping frequency ranges are dropped in the pds with the lesser integrated time .",
    "for example : with 50 medium - frequency ffts and 200 high frequency ffts , the medium - frequency ffts represent 64 s @xmath27 50 = 3200 s of data , while the  ffts represent 8 s @xmath27 200 = 1600 s of data .",
    "therefore , all the data @xmath228 hz would be dropped in the high - frequency pds , and then the two pds are merged .    the final frequency range of the composite pds is 0.0009764 hz or less if data of sufficient contiguous duration or time resolution are not available , and is normalized as , and corrected for dead time and background .    the data of the high , medium and low frequency range parts of the single pds are not necessarily taken at the same time .",
    "thus , this type of pds is subject to systematic uncertainties due to changes in the pds within a single selection criteria .",
    "in addition , there may be more data available in one frequency range than in others .    for each of the ten individual objects , we produced four composite pds ( of the low , medium , and high energy range , and for the full intensity range ) from data selected by  to be in each of the coarse spectral hardness bins ( a , b , c , ... ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorccd ] and described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ccd ] .",
    "we used these pds to investigate the dependence of bbn variability on spectral hardness , to search for the presence of qpo and understand the dependence of qpo properties on spectral hardness and photon energy .",
    "there are , at times , intensity `` spikes '' which occur in the data , a few msec in duration , which are typically not due to source variability , but instead to a variety of background sources ( some of these spikes were due to geomagnetically trapped particles from orbiting nuclear power generators .",
    "these events , and the observed 2 - 37 kev pha spectra , are discussed further elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "we systematically excluded these spikes from our analysis , as they can produce significant , measurable power across all frequencies . when a single time bin is found",
    "in which the number of counts is 20 @xmath20  ( calculated from the intrinsic scatter of the data used for that particular fft ) greater than the mean number of counts , that value was replaced by a value randomly selected from a set of bins in the data used for that fft .",
    "such events , even if real , are identifiable as discrete events , which are not our primary focus .      in practice",
    ", the models adopted to fit a pds may not be ideal , or even formally acceptable according to statistical tests .",
    "discrepancies may be systematic  for example , due to the skew of a quasi - lorentzian peak which is not accounted for in the model  or they may be due to excursions from simply parameterizable continuum behavior in the pds  that is , deviations from the model which are non - biased , like random scatter , but statistically significant .",
    "there exists no _ a priori _ reason that such biased and noisy pds should not exist .",
    "thus , while it is desirable to fit the models as closely to the data as possible , there can be a trade - off between the accuracy and simplicity of a model .",
    "these parameterizations are not physically motivated , and thus their utility is to accurately describe pds using a small set of numbers .    for the present study , we desire simple parameterizations which adequately describe pds from all 10 sources .",
    "we avoid the introduction of new parameters , apart from switching to a more reasonable parameterization .",
    "we use a maximum - likelihood fitting method ( least @xmath28 ; ) , and quote the 1@xmath20 single parameter uncertainties , the reduced @xmath28 , and the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we use a number of models , most of which have become widely used in describing pds of x - ray binaries , to fit the observed power ( p ) as a function of frequency ( @xmath29 ) to the pds .",

    "anti-_correlation above some spectral hardness ; in addition , all three objects show power - law pds behavior when the centroid frequency is correlated with spectral hardness , and band - limited pds behavior when the centroid frequency is anti - correlated with spectral hardness .    the differences between the behavior of cyg  x-1 and that which we observe from gx  339 - 4 and gs  1124 - 68 is that the qpo ( in cyg x-1 ) are considerably broader qpo ( q1 compared with q10 ) , and the 2 - 20 kev flux is only moderately greater than its low state flux , and still below that of its high state @xcite , while gx  339 - 4 and gs  1124 - 68 were observed with @xmath14 2 - 20 kev intensities greater than periods where `` high state '' behavior was observed .",

    "however , the change in dependence of the qpo centroid frequency on spectral hardness , associated with the change in the bbn variability is suggestive that the phenomena of cyg  x-1 observed during transition between low and high state is the same as that which we describe of gs  1124 - 68 and gx  339 - 4 in their very high state , in spite of the differences in @xmath14 2 - 20 kev intensity .",
    "we conclude that the conditions for transition between the two states occur at luminosities both above ( in the case of the very high state ) and below ( in the case of the intermediate state ) the high - state in bhcs .",
    "we can not exclude that the assumption that the 2 - 20 kev flux ( usually thought to correspond to @xmath17 ) is a monotonic indicator of states is not correct .",
    "for example , gs  2023 + 33 exhibited spectral and timing behavior which has been classified as `` low state '' ( spectrally hard , with band - limited noise ) , even at its highest luminosity  although much caution must be employed in interpreting this behavior , as gs  2023 + 33 was a peculiar x - ray transient in more than one way ( cf . ) .",
    "the strength of the underlying bbn variability is ( in gs  1124 - 68 ) on average decreased by the presence of qpo .",
    "one might interpret this to mean that , while the physical process producing the vhs qpo is distinct from that of the bbn variability , there is nonetheless interaction between the two processes which affects the strength of the bbn variability .",
    "it does not follow naturally from any other observed behavior that , as a function of spectral hardness , the variability ratio should be low ( @xmath141 ) , _ increase _ with increasing spectral hardness toward the transition point (  @xmath14 0.055 , where it is 4 ) , and then _ decrease _ with increasing spectral hardness .",
    "this therefore represents a significant and interesting phenomenon , which requires further discussion .",
    "it implies that the spectrum of the qpo is ( in the low state ) similar to the spectrum of the bbn variability ; as the source spectrum evolves toward the high state , the qpo spectrum becomes spectrally hard , relative to the bbn variability , becoming maximally spectrally hard relative to the bbn variability at the same  as when the qpo centroid frequency is at its maximum ; and then , as the spectrum evolves further toward the high state , the spectrum of the qpo again softens toward the spectrum of the bbn variability .",
    "( we emphasize here that `` evolution '' is as a function of spectral hardness , not of time ) .",
    "there exists no _ a priori _ reason that the qpo photon spectrum should at any time be in any way similar to the bbn variability photon spectrum  the variability ratio could , in principle , take on any value between 0 and infinity . that the lowest observed values of the variability ratio indicate that the qpo energy spectrum is similar to the bbn energy spectrum suggests that the qpo itself is due to the same mechanism as the bbn variability , which for some unknown reason becomes enhanced at a particular frequency .    in summary , the observed dependence on spectral hardness of the bbn variability",
    "while qpo are observed from gx  339 - 4 and gs  1124 - 68 , and their position on the color - color diagram spectrally intermediate to the low - state and high - state indicate that the so - called very high state qpo is due to interaction between the physical component responsible for low state behavior and that responsible for high state behavior .",
    "our comparison with qpo observed from cyg  x-1 at lower luminosity , during transition between the low and high states , indicate that these qpo may also be due to such interaction .",

    "<S> by comparing positions on a spectral color - color diagram from 10 black hole candidates ( bhcs ) observed with  ( ) with the observed broad - band noise ( 0.001 - 64 hz ; bbn ) and quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) variability , we find that the so - called `` very high state '' is spectrally intermediate to the soft / high - state and hard / low - state . </S>",
    "<S> we find a transition point in spectral hardness where the dependence of the bhc qpo centroid frequency ( of gs  1124 - 68 and gx  339 - 4 ) on spectral hardness switches from a correlation to an anti - correlation ; where the bbn variability switches from high - state to low - state ; and where the spectral hardness of the qpo relative to that of the bbn variability is a maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this coincidence of changing behavior in both the qpo and the broad - band variability leads us to hypothesize that the qpo is due to interaction between the physical components which dominate the behaviors of bhcs when they occupy the hard / low and soft / high states . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that these qpo should be observed from bhcs during transition between these two states . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with qpo and bbn behavior observed during the 1996 transition of cyg  x-1 supports this hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> we also report 1 - 3 hz qpo observed in gs  2000 + 25 and cyg  x-1 in the hard / low state , and we compare these to the qpo observed in gs  1124 - 68 and gx  339 - 4 .    </S>",
