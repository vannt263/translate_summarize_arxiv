    "there is currently growing interplay between physics of hadrons ( especially the properties of hadrons in dense matter which might reflect spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration ) , the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( from which one might extract hadron properties in dense matter ) , and the physics of compact objects in astrophysics ( which needs as inputs the information gained from the first two fields ) . a notable example is the kaon ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , which , being a goldstone boson with strangeness , plays a special role in all the three fields mentioned .    ever since the pioneering work of kaplan and nelson @xcite on the possibility of kaon condensation in nuclear matter , a huge amount of theoretical effort has been devoted to the study of kaon properties in dense matter , based mostly on the su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "kaons , as goldstone bosons with strangeness , play a special role in the development of hadron models .",
    "the mass of the strange quark is about 150 mev , which is , on the one hand , considerably larger than the mass of light ( up and down ) quarks ( @xmath3 mev ) , but on the other hand , much smaller than that of the charmed quark ( @xmath4 gev ) . in the limit of vanishing quark mass",
    "the chiral symmetry is good , and systematic studies can be carried out using chiral perturbation theory for hadrons made of light quarks . since its mass is not negligibly small as compared with the typical qcd chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath5 gev , the expansion in terms of the strange quark mass is much more delicate . in spite of this ,",
    "chiral perturbation calculations have been extensively and quite successfully carried out in the recent past for the study of kaon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) and antikaon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) scattering .",
    "part of the reason for this success , at least in free space , can be attributed to the availability of a large body of experimental data which can be used to constrain the various parameters in the chiral lagrangian . in studying kaon properties in nuclear matter , a new scale , namely the nuclear fermi momentum @xmath8 , is introduced .",
    "this renders the chiral perturbation calculation in matter much more subtle than that in free space .",
    "it is very important to have experimental data available so that the predictions of chiral perturbation calculations can be tested .",
    "kaonic atom data provide information on this , but is restricted to very low densities @xcite . for the study of kaon condensation ,",
    "densities much higher than that accessible by kaonic atoms are involved .",
    "this can only be obtained by analysing heavy - ion collision data on kaon spectra and flow .",
    "measurements of kaon spectra and flow have been systematically carried out in heavy - ion collisions at sis ( 1 - 2 agev ) , ags ( 10 agev ) , and sps ( 200 agev ) energies @xcite . by comparing transport model predictions with experimental data",
    ", one can learn not only the global reaction dynamics , but more importantly , the kaon properties in dense matter .",
    "of special interest is kaon production in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies , as it has been shown that particle production at subthreshold energies is sensitive to its properties in dense matter @xcite .",
    "recently , high quality data concerning @xmath9 and @xmath10 production in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies have been published by the kaos collaboration at gsi @xcite .",
    "the kaos data show that the @xmath10 yield at 1.8 agev agrees roughly with the @xmath9 yield at 1.0 agev .",
    "this is a nontrivial observation .",
    "these beam energies were purposely chosen , such that the q - values ( the difference between the available center - of - mass energy and the threshold ) for @xmath11 and @xmath12 are identical and both are about @xmath13 mev .",
    "near their respective production thresholds , the cross section for the @xmath10 production in proton - proton interaction is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath9 production @xcite .",
    "in addition , antikaons are strongly absorbed in heavy - ion collisions , which should further reduce the @xmath10 yield .",
    "the kaos results of @xmath14 indicate thus the importance of kaon medium effects which act oppositely on the @xmath9 and @xmath10 production in nuclear medium , and can thus provide useful information on kaon properties in dense matter .    studies of neutron star properties also have a long history , both observationally and theoretically . a recent compilation by thorsett quoted by brown @xcite shows that well - measured neutron star masses are all less than 1.5@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , most of the theoretical calculations based on conventional nuclear equation of state ( eos ) predict a maximum neutron state mass above 2@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the eos can , therefore , be substantially softened without running into contradiction with observation .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed that can lead to a soft eos .",
    "brown and collaborators suggested that kaon condensation might happen at a critical density of 2 - 4@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the existence of many @xmath10 mesons implies the coexistence of a large number of protons that are needed to neutralize the negative charge of @xmath10 mesons @xcite .",
    "based on this , brown and bethe also proposed the interesting possibility of the existence of a large number of low mass black holes in the galaxy @xcite .    in the first part of this paper , section 2 , we review various theoretical approaches for studying kaon properties in nuclear medium",
    ". we shall focus on the limitations and possible uncertainties in each approach . in the second part , section 3",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of kaon production in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies .",
    "we will discuss in detail the elementary kaon and antikaon production cross sections in hadron - hadron interactions , which are the major sources of uncertainties in the transport model study of particle production in heavy - ion collisions . by comparing transport model predictions with experimental data ,",
    "we try to extract kaon in - medium properties at high densities .",
    "this information is very useful for the development of chiral perturbation theory for finite density .",
    "this also provides guidance for the study of kaon condensation in neutron stars , which is the focus of section 4 .",
    "we calculate neutron star masses based on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) of furnstahl , tang and serot @xcite . without kaon condensation , the maximum neutron star mass",
    "is predicted to be about 2.0@xmath0 , which reduces to about 1.5@xmath0 once kaon condensation is introduced .",
    "the paper ends with summary and outlook in section 5 .",
    "ever since the pioneering work of kaplan and nelson @xcite on the possibility of kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter , many works have been devoted to the study of kaon properties in nuclear matter .",
    "there are two typical approaches to this problem .",
    "one was initiated by kaplan and nelson , and is based on the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the other has been pursued by schaffer _",
    "et al . _ and knorren _",
    "based on the extension of the walecka - type mean field model from su(2 ) to su(3 ) . in other words",
    ", it follows the traditional meson - exchange idea for hadron interactions .",
    "this latter approach has also been developed by the jlich group for the description of kaon - nucleon scattering in free space @xcite .",
    "in addition , kaon properties in dense matter have been studied using the nambu@xmath16jona - lasinio model @xcite , treating the kaon as quark - antiquark excitation , and phenomenological off - shell meson - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "although quantitatively , the results from these different models are not completely identical , qualitatively , a consistent picture , namely in nuclear matter the kaon feels a weak repulsive potential and the antikaon feels a strong attractive potential , has emerged . in this section",
    "we will discuss mainly the results of the chiral perturbation theory and the meson - exchange model .",
    "the interactions between pseudoscalar mesons ( pion , kaon , and eta meson ) and baryons ( nucleon and hyperon ) are described by the su(3)@xmath17su(3)@xmath18 nonlinear chiral lagrangian which can be written as @xmath19 + { \\rm tr}{\\bar b}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m_b)b\\nonumber\\\\ & + & i{\\rm tr}{\\bar b}\\gamma^\\mu[v_\\mu , b ] + d{\\rm tr}{\\bar b}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^5\\{a_\\mu , b\\ } + f{\\rm tr}{\\bar b}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^5[a_\\mu , b]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & a_1{\\rm tr}{\\bar b}(\\xi m_q\\xi+{\\rm h.c.})b + a_2{\\rm tr}{\\bar b}b(\\xi m_q\\xi+{\\rm h.c.})\\nonumber\\\\ & + & a_3[{\\rm tr}m_q\\sigma+{\\rm h.c.}]{\\rm tr}{\\bar b}b.\\label{lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath20 is the baryon octet with a degenerate mass @xmath21 , and @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the pseudoscalar meson octet .",

    "( [ lag2 ] ) is the usual weinberg - tomozawa term ; it gives rise to a repulsive vector potential for @xmath9 , and an attractive vector potential for @xmath10 .",
    "the one that goes with the kaon mass is usually called kaplan - nelson term ; it provides scalar attraction for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and thus reduces their mass .",
    "the amount of scalar attraction is linearly proportional to the kaon - nucleon sigma term , @xmath41 . from eq .",
    "( [ skn ] ) we see that @xmath41 depends on three coefficients , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . while the first two coefficients are relatively well determined from the baryon mass splitting @xcite , the dominant term , @xmath44 , is only poorly known , mainly because of the large uncertainties in the nucleon strangeness content .",
    "on the other hand , the kaon - nucleon sigma term can be related to pion - nucleon sigma term , @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the latter is relatively well determined to be about 45 mev @xcite , @xmath46 where the strangeness content of nucleon is defined as @xmath47 from the particle data book @xcite , we know that the average mass of the light quark is @xmath48 mev . there is a large uncertainty in the strange quark mass @xmath49 which ranges from 100 to 300 mev @xcite .",
    "there is also a large uncertainty in the nucleon strangeness content , which ranges from 0 to about 0.3 @xcite .    in the mean - field approximation and",
    "including only the weinberg - tomozawa and the kaplan - nelson terms , the kaon dispersion relation in nuclear matter is then given by @xmath50 where * p * is the three - momentum of the kaon . from the dispersion relation , the kaon energy in medium can be obtained , i.e. , @xmath51^{1/2 } + { 3\\over 8}{\\rho_n\\over f^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for the antikaon , @xmath52^{1/2 } -{3\\over 8}{\\rho_n\\over f^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the scalar attraction depends on nucleon scalar density @xmath53 , which is model dependent @xcite .",
    "there are a number of corrections to these simple mean - field results .",
    "below we discuss some of them .",
    "_ range term : _ at the same order in chiral perturbation theory as the kaplan - nelson term is the energy - dependent range term .",
    "this has been studied in great detail in refs .",
    "it has been shown that the range term reduces the scalar attraction and can be approximately included , with @xmath54 mev , by multiplying the kaplan - nelson term by a factor @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "note that in the nuclear medium , the kaon effective mass increases , while that of the antikaon decreases .",
    "therefore , while the range term is very important for @xmath9 , it is less so for @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , the scalar attraction for @xmath9 is different from that for @xmath10 .    _",
    "brown - rho scaling : _ in the nuclear medium , the pion decay constant @xmath56 may decrease @xcite . at finite density , this can be easily seen from the gell - mann@xmath16oakes@xmath16renner relation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , brown and rho has shown that the scaling in @xmath56 is instructive in linking the chiral lagrangian in free space to walecka mean - field model for finite nuclei .",
    "the enhancement of low - mass dileptons in heavy - ion collisions might be considered as empirical evidence for this scaling @xcite . including this scaling , the vector attraction for @xmath10 increases significantly .    _",
    "short - range correlations : _ at high densities , a simple mean - field type treatment of kaon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon interactions might be inadequate .",
    "the effects of short - range correlations in nucleon - nucleon and kaon - nucleon interactions were studied by pandharipande , pethick , and thorsson @xcite , and were found to reduce the scalar attraction significantly .",
    "there will , however , be a tendency for the effects from scaling in @xmath56 and short range correlation to cancel each other .",
    "_ @xmath57 and coupled - channel effects : _ the isospin averaged @xmath58 scattering length is negative in free space @xcite , implying a repulsive @xmath10 optical potential in the simple impulse approximation .",
    "however , a systematic analysis of the kaonic atom data shows that the @xmath10 optical potential is deeply attractive , with a value of about 200@xmath59 20 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xcite . unlike the kaon which interacts with nucleons relatively weakly",
    "so that the impulse approximation is reasonable , the antikaon interacts strongly with nucleons so we do not expect the impulse approximation to be reliable .",
    "the antikaon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) interaction at low - energy is strongly affected by the @xmath57 which is a quasi bound state of an antikaon and a nucleon in the isospin @xmath60 channel and can decay into @xmath61 channel @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle one needs to carry out a coupled - channel calculation for @xmath7 , @xmath62 and @xmath61 including the effects of @xmath57 in both free space and in nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "this has been studied in detail by weise and collaborators @xcite . in effective chiral lagrangian",
    ", however , one can also introduce @xmath63 as a fundamental field , which is consistent with phenomenological @xmath7 scattering amplitudes and branching ratios @xcite .",
    "because of pauli blocking effects on the intermediate states , the possibility of forming a bound @xmath7 state ( @xmath57 ) decreases with increasing density , leading to a dissociation of @xmath63 in nuclear medium .",
    "this induces a transition of the @xmath10 potential from repulsion at very low densities to attraction at higher densities @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , that , because of the diminishing role of @xmath57 in dense matter , the prediction for the kaon condensation threshold is relatively robust with respect to different treatments of @xmath57 .    in view of large uncertainties in @xmath41 and difficulties in treating systematically high - order corrections ,",
    "we adopt in this paper a more phenomenological approach .",
    "we assume that the effects from the scaling in @xmath56 and short - range correlations approximately cancel each other .",
    "furthermore , we introduce two free parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which determine the scalar attractions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that these are density independent , although in principle they should be density dependent , since the range term , the scaling in @xmath56 , and the short - range corrections are all density dependent . the kaon and antikaon energy in the nuclear medium",

    "we try to determine @xmath64 and @xmath65 from the experimental observables in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "since the kaon - nucleon interaction is relatively weak as compared to other hadron - nucleon interactions , impulse approximation is considered to be reasonable for the kaon potential in nuclear matter , at least at low densities .",
    "this provides some constraint on @xmath64 . using @xmath70 gev@xmath71@xmath69",
    ", we find that at normal nuclear matter density @xmath72 @xmath73 , the @xmath9 feels a repulsive potential of about 20 mev .",
    "this is in rough agreement with what is expected from the impulse approximation using the @xmath6 scattering length in free space .",
    "note that as @xmath74 approaches zero , @xmath75 therefore @xmath70 gev@xmath71@xmath69 implies @xmath76 mev .",
    "this is exactly the value determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting the @xmath6 scattering length .",
    "determination of the @xmath65 is more delicate , as impulse approximation does not apply .",
    "the @xmath65 should show stronger density dependence than @xmath64 , as the effects of @xmath77 and coupled - channels are both strongly density dependent .",
    "we will try to determine this value by fitting to heavy - ion data .",
    "we find that , when using the model of furnstahl , tang , and serot @xcite for dense matter , @xmath78 gev@xmath71@xmath69 provides a good fit to the @xmath10 data in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies . since the @xmath10 production chiefly proceeds at the high densities ( @xmath79-@xmath80 ) , the value of @xmath65 determined here needs not apply to lower densities , e.g. , those sampled in kaonic atoms .    with these two parameters we show in fig .",
    "[ kmass ] the effective masses of kaon and antikaon defined as their energies at zero momentum .",
    "it is seen that the kaon mass increases slightly with density , resulting from near cancellation of the attractive scalar and repulsive vector potential . the mass of the antikaon drops substantially . at normal nuclear matter density , the kaon mass increases about 4% , in rough agreement with the prediction of impulse approximation based on @xmath6 scattering length .",
    "the antikaon mass drops by about 22% , which is somewhat smaller than what has been inferred from the kaonic atom data @xcite , namely , an attractive @xmath10 potential of @xmath81 mev at @xmath15 .    from their in - medium dispersion relations , we can define the kaon and antikaon potential as the difference between its energies in the medium and in free space @xcite , @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "kaon and antikaon potentials at two different momenta are shown in fig .",
    "the open circle in the figure is the @xmath9 potential expected from the impulse approximation using the kaon - nucleon scattering length in free space @xcite .",
    "the solid circle is the @xmath10 potential extracted from the kaonic atom data @xcite .",
    "the chiral lagrangian as given above does not describe properly the nuclear matter properties .",
    "therefore in most of the studies about kaon condensation in density matter , the nuclear matter properties are obtained based on some form of walecka - type mean - field model ; e.g. , in this work we use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has imposed chiral constraints on the mean field .",
    "the question then is , as put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , whether it is possible to describe the kaon - nucleon interaction using the idea of meson - exchange . this has been addressed by schaffer _",
    "@xcite for symmetric nuclear matter , and by knorren _",
    "@xcite for more general case as encountered in neutron stars .    in the meson - exchange picture , the scalar and vector interaction between kaon and nucleon",

    "first , they depend on the strength of the scalar and vector fields , which might be constrained from the nuclear matter properties .",
    "second , they depend on the coupling constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in the simple quark model , @xmath93 , since there is only one light quark in kaon .",
    "the relation for scalar couplings is more subtle , since there is no fundamental scalar meson ; it represent correlated s - wave two - pion exchange .    by analysing kaon - nucleon scattering in the meson - exchange model , and by fitting to experimental data ,",
    "one may be able to determine these coupling constants .",
    "this is the approach adopted in refs .",

    "this is analogous to the case of nuclear matter saturation , namely , one can not apply directly the coupling constants in the bonn model to the walecka - type mean - field model for nuclear matter saturation .",
    "starting from the bonn model for nucleon - nucleon interaction , one can carry out dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculation to study nuclear matter properties . in the same sense , one can study kaon properties in nuclear matter starting from the jlich kaon - nucleon ( and antikaon - nucleon ) interactions , by solving in - medium scattering equation ( the so - called g - matrix ) .",
    "this kind of approach should provide a consistent way of study hadron systems containing strangeness degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the most important ingredients in the transport model study of particle production in heavy - ion collisions is the elementary particle production cross sections in hadron - hadron interactions . at sis energies , the colliding system consists mainly of nucleons , delta resonances , and pions .",

    "one of the advantages of a model calculation is that the isospin average can be done explicitly .",

    "the first detailed analysis of the experimental data was carried out by randrup and ko @xcite .",
    "they proposed the following parameterizations for the available data @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the maximum momentum of kaon given by @xmath124 with @xmath115 the total energy and @xmath125 the mass of hyperon in the final state .",
    "based on experimental data and isospin analysis , randrup and ko also obtained the following isospin - averaged cross sections @xmath126 where @xmath127 is either lambda or sigma hyperon .",

    "the slopes of the kaon spectra in the two cases also differ . with a repulsive potential ,",
    "kaons are accelerated during the propagation , leading to a larger slope parameter as compared to the case without kaon medium effects .",
    "the results for the @xmath10 kinetic energy spectra are shown in fig .",

    "this is similar to the findings of cassing _ et al .",
    "also , with the inclusion of kaon medium effects , the slope parameter of the @xmath10 spectra decreases , since the propagation of antikaons in their attractive potential reduces their momenta .    as mentioned earlier , the kaos observation that the @xmath10 yield at 1.8 agev is similar to @xmath9 yield at 1.0 agev is an indication of the kaon medium effects .",
    "this can best be seen in our results by looking at their ratio as a function of kinetic energy .",
    "this is done in fig .",

    "we can also see more clearly the effects of kaon and antikaon mean - field potentials on the shapes of their momentum spectra .",
    "it is seen that without kaon medium effects , the @xmath268 ratio decreases from about 7 at low kinetic energies to about 1 at high kinetic energies . in central collisions",
    "the ratio of their total yield is @xmath269 , which is much greater than the kaos observation of about 1 . since the antikaon absorption cross section by nucleons increases rapidly at low momentum , low - momentum antikaons are more strongly absorbed by nucleons than high - momentum ones",
    "this makes the @xmath268 ratio increase with decreasing kinetic energies . when medium effects are included , we find that the @xmath268 ratio is almost a constant of about 1 in the entire kinetic energy region , which is in good agreement with the experimental data from the kaos collaboration @xcite , shown in the figure by open circles .",
    "the ratio between their total yields in the central collisions is @xmath270 , very close to the kaos observation of about 1 . as mentioned , the shapes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra change in opposite ways in the presence of their mean - field potential .",
    "kaons are ` pushed ' to high momenta by the repulsive potential , while antikaons are ` pulled ' to low momenta .",
    "if there were no antikaon absorption , or if the absorption cross section were independent of antikaon momentum , the @xmath268 would increase with kinetic energy because of propagation in the mean - field potential .",
    "a ` flat ' @xmath268 spectra is thus highly nontrivial , which must be result from the combined effects of mean - field and energy - dependent antikaon absorption .",
    "an accurate experimental measurement of this ratio can thus be very useful in determining whether there are medium effects or not on kaons in nuclear matter .      in figs .",
    "[ kmt10 ] and [ kmt193 ] we show the @xmath9 transverse mass spectra at mid - rapidity in central ni+ni collisions at 1.0 and 1.93 agev , respectively .",

    "finally , we show in fig .",

    "this is in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "the @xmath9 yield , on the other hand , increases by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "its beam energy dependence is about @xmath275 .",
    "the difference between the beam energy dependence of pion and kaon yield reflects the fact that at these energies kaon production is ` subthreshold ' or near - threshold , while pion production is well above the threshold .",
