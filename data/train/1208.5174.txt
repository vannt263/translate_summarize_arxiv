    "the study of quantum limits on linear amplifiers became important in the 1960s with the invention and use of masers as microwave amplifiers .",
    "initial investigations  @xcite led to the realization that quantum mechanics requires all phase - preserving linear amplifiers to add noise , thereby degrading the signal - to - noise ratio of the input signal . for a high - gain linear amplifier , the minimum amount of added noise , when referred to the input of the amplifier , is equivalent to half a quantum at the operating frequency  @xcite . for a quantum - limited input signal ,",
    "this means a doubling of the input signal s zero - point noise and a halving of the input signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this fundamental quantum limit is expressed formally as a bound on the second moment of the noise added by a phase - preserving linear amplifier .",
    "a comprehensive review article reprises the development and elaboration of this fundamental quantum limitation on the operation of linear amplifiers  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", microwave - frequency amplifiers , based on the josephson effect , have very closely approached the fundamental quantum limit on second - moment added noise  @xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "workers in quantum optics have formulated techniques for determining photon correlation functions without using photon counting , instead using the linear detection that at optical frequencies comes from homodyne detection  @xcite .",
    "researchers working with linear amplifiers at microwave frequencies have refined and elaborated these techniques into methods for determining the noise properties of signals input to a linear amplifier and of the added amplifier noise  @xcite .",
    "these methods have been used to determine moments of amplifier noise well beyond second moments  @xcite , to measure photon correlation functions of input microwave signals  @xcite , to do quantum tomography on itinerant ( wave - packet ) microwave photons  @xcite , and to study squeezing of microwave fields  @xcite .",
    "all these developments motivate an investigation of quantum limits on all moments of the added noise or , equivalently , on the entire distribution of added noise .",
    "second moments are sufficient to characterize the added noise if it is gaussian ; measuring higher moments allows one both to check the gaussianity of the added noise and to characterize the performance of linear amplifiers more thoroughly . here",
    "we consider the case of phase - preserving amplification of a single bosonic mode , which we call the _ primary mode _ and which has annihilation operator  @xmath0 .",
    "we characterize the input and output noise in terms of symmetrically ordered moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 or , equivalently , in terms of symmetrically ordered moments of the input and output quadrature components . with this convention , the noise is described completely by the input and output wigner functions of the primary mode .",
    "we show here that regardless of how a phase - preserving linear amplifier is realized physically , it is equivalent to a parametric amplifier , i.e. , an amplifier in which the primary mode undergoes a two - mode squeezing interaction with a single _ ancillary mode _ , which has annihilation operator @xmath2 . the strength of the parametric interaction determines the amplifier s gain , and the noise added by the amplifier is distributed according to the wigner function of the ancillary mode s initial state @xmath3 . characterizing completely the noise properties of a phase - preserving linear amplifier",
    "thus amounts to giving the initial state of this effective ancillary mode , even though the amplifier might be nothing like a parametric amplifier .",
    "a quantum - limited ( ideal ) linear amplifier corresponds to the case where @xmath3 is the vacuum state .",

    "this implies an uncertainty principle , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the difference between an operator and its expectation value , @xmath15 , and hence @xmath16 is the variance of @xmath17 .",
    "we can think of the signal as being carried by a single - mode field @xmath18 the annihilation operator is a complex - amplitude operator for the field ; the expectation value of the field , @xmath19 , oscillates with the amplitude and phase of @xmath20 .",
    "the variance of @xmath21 characterizes the noise in the signal ; for phase - insensitive noise , this variance is constant and given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the symmetric variance of  @xmath0 .",

    "the symmetric variance  ( [ eq : asecmom ] ) obeys an uncertainty principle , @xmath25 the lower bound is the half - quantum of zero - point ( or vacuum ) noise .",
    "the first inequality is saturated if and only if the noise is phase insensitive , i.e. , @xmath26 , the second if and only if the quadrature uncertainties have minimum uncertainty product .",
    "both inequalities are saturated if and only if the mode is in a coherent state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the displacement operator for mode  @xmath0 .",
    "we use a two - slot notation for the displacement operator , partly so as to identify the mode the displacement operator pertains to and partly so that by putting a c - number in both slots , as in @xmath29 , we have a convenient notation for two - dimensional fourier transforms  @xcite .",
    "the objective of phase - preserving linear amplification is to increase the size of an input signal by a ( real ) multiplicative amplitude gain @xmath30 , regardless of the input phase , while introducing as little noise as possible .",
    "the amplification of the input signal can be expressed as the transformation @xmath31 of the expected complex amplitude .",
    "perfect _ linear amplifier would perform this feat while preserving the signal - to - noise ; in the heisenberg picture , the primary mode s annihilation operator , not just its expectation value , would transform from input to output  as @xmath32 the second - moment noise would be amplified by the power gain @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "the amplifier s output would be contaminated by the same noise as the input , blown up by a factor of @xmath33 , but the amplification process would not add any noise to the amplified input noise .",
    "alas , quantum mechanics prohibits free lunches : there are no perfect phase - preserving linear amplifiers ; the transformation  ( [ eq : ioperfect ] ) does not preserve the canonical commutation relation and thus violates unitarity .",
    "physically , this is the statement that amplification of the primary mode requires it to be coupled to other physical systems , not least to provide the energy needed for amplification ; these other systems , which can thought of as the amplifier s internal degrees of freedom , necessarily add noise to the output .",

    ", however , quantum mechanics extracts its due : any phase - preserving linear amplifier must add noise , which is equivalent to half a quantum at the input in the limit of high gain .    in this paper we consider the full set of quantum constraints on the operation of a single - mode phase - preserving linear amplifier , going well beyond the usual emphasis on second moments and gaussian noise .",
    "our main result is that any phase - preserving linear amplifier is equivalent to a parametric amplifier with a single ancillary mode that begins in a physical state @xmath3 .",

    "we expect our main result to generalize in the obvious way : at each frequency , the amplifier will be equivalent to a parametric amplifier , with an ancillary mode that provides the frequency - dependent gain at that frequency ; the joint state of all the ancillary modes will have to be physical , but the ancillary modes will not have to be independent , even in the case of time - stationary noise .",
    "the second moments of the added noise will be expressed in terms of a spectral density of added noise , which will obey the usual quantum limit  @xcite . for gaussian noise , the added - noise spectral density will be the entire story , but for a nongaussian amplifier , there will not only be the possibility of nongaussian ancillary - mode states , as in a single - mode amplifier , but also the possibility of entanglement among the ancillary modes at different frequencies .",
