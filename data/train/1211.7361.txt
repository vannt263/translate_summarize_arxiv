    "the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations is well measured on cosmological scales using the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure @xcite .",
    "these observations provide compelling evidence that the fluctuations originated in an era of inflation .",
    "however , there is a great deal of new information waiting to be accessed in small - scale fluctuations and in higher - order statistics ( non - gaussianity ) . in this paper",
    "we explore both new regimes by examining how object number counts constrain the probability distribution of primordial fluctuations . by looking at very small objects ( primordial black holes and ultracompact minihalos ) ,",
    "we constrain the power in fluctuations on smaller scales than the cmb and large scale structure currently probe , @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "since these objects are also very rare , we constrain the level of non - gaussianity by limiting the abundance of extreme primordial overdensities .    counts of rare objects are a useful probe of the primordial inhomogeneities in the gravitational field and their evolution : different objects probe different scales , different cosmological eras , and different particle physics and astrophysics . primordial black holes ( pbhs ) have been used as a probe of small - scale power for many years @xcite .",
    "their abundance limits the allowed fluctuation power on very small scales , but the constraint is weak compared to the numbers expected from extrapolating a scale - invariant spectrum down from cmb scales @xcite .",
    "more recently , a much stronger constraint on small - scale power was obtained by considering ultracompact minihalos ( ucmhs ) of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the only drawback of this approach is that the strongest limits @xcite require dark matter to annihilate into standard model ( sm ) particles , which can then be sought using standard indirect dark matter detection techniques @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ucmh constraints on the small - scale power obtainable by microlensing @xcite are still stronger than pbh constraints , and apply even for non - annihilating dark matter .",
    "the abundance of pbhs was also considered early on as a probe of non - gaussianity @xcite . in a non - gaussian distribution",
    ", the number of rare objects is different from the gaussian expectation , and rarer objects are typically sensitive to higher moments of the distribution .",
    "number counts pick up _ any _ deviation from gaussianity in a model - independent way and provide complementary constraints to those on the individual correlation functions , such as the shape of the 3-point function in momentum space ( the bispectrum ) . however , there are important limitations on what can be learned from number counts on both the analytic and observational sides .",
    "first , in general one only knows the non - gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) approximately , usually in terms of a few of the lowest - order moments .",
    "this limits how far out onto its tail the distribution is known , and so limits the utility of looking at very rare objects to constrain particular models .",
    "furthermore , the best controlled approximations to weakly non - gaussian pdfs are asymptotic expansions , so for a given level of non - gaussianity one trusts the expansion only so far out onto the tail . the greater the level of non - gaussianity , the more limited the range of utility of the asymptotic expansion . on the observational side",
    ", one must know the amplitude of fluctuations ( the variance of the distribution ) very precisely in order to find sharp constraints on the level of non - gaussianity .",
    "the relationship between mass and the observable signature of the objects must be also be known accurately and precisely .",
    "finally , extremely rare objects are not necessarily expected to be present in any finite sample ( e.g. in any single survey or even our universe ) , which makes drawing conclusions from their absence , or from very small number statistics , difficult .",

    "our results generalize all previous work on weakly non - gaussian models , demonstrating how constraints can be obtained from any object abundance and for any weakly non - gaussian distribution .",
    "we use an extended press - schechter @xcite approach where the abundance of an object is determined by the overdensity required for its formation ( @xmath10 ) , the mass variance smoothed over the region that forms the object ( @xmath11 ) , and similarly smoothed higher - order moments of the density fluctuations .",
    "these variables can be straightforwardly computed for _ any _ object : one need only compute the collapse threshold and smoothed statistics ( by propagating the primordial fluctuations forward to the appropriate time of formation using transfer functions and a growth factor ) .",
    "this method is a straightforward extension of previous work on an analytic , weakly non - gaussian mass function for galaxy clusters @xcite .",

    "in addition , we consider a wider range of non - gaussian scenarios by parameterizing deviations from gaussianity with both the value of the dimensionless skewness ( @xmath13 ) and a rule for how the higher moments scale with respect to the skewness .",
    "most previous work assumes one particular choice , but physical mechanisms generating the primordial fluctuations do not all follow that pattern , and the distinction is important for interpreting constraints . by demonstrating the computational limits of the edgeworth expansion , we also clarify why strongly non - gaussian models must be evaluated on a case - by - case basis .",
    "although we focus on small - scale constraints from pbhs and ucmhs in this work , the techniques we develop are equally applicable to limits on the abundances of high - redshift clusters , which provide strong constraints on non - gaussianity on larger scales @xcite .",

    "there is a straightforward mapping between the dimensionless skewness and the power spectrum and bispectrum of any particular model ( and choice of cosmological parameters ) .",

    "we have assumed that both the power spectrum and @xmath63 parameters are constant over the range where the integrals peak , @xmath64 , which is not too restrictive since only about a decade in @xmath37 contributes significantly to the integrals .",
    "the dimensionless moments are straightforward to calculate for any inflation model , and the hierarchical and feeder scalings we use are representative of the full range of primordial non - gaussianity that has its origin in the particle physics of inflation . since the moments are determined from a perturbation - theory expansion of some lagrangian , they do indeed scale in a simple way depending on a single parameter that determines the overall level of interaction together with order - one coefficients .",
    "any scenario where the non - gaussian interactions can be modeled by a single source , including inflaton self - interactions and curvaton models , gives rise to the hierarchical scaling .",
    "scenarios where non - gaussian fields couple to the primary source of curvature perturbation to generate the non - gaussianity have the feeder scaling or a hybrid of the two types .",
    "since a pure feeder scaling is the most non - gaussian scaling ( for a given skewness ) known to be generated from inflation , the purely hierarchical and purely feeder scalings nicely bracket the behavior of all known inflation models .    finally ,",
    "although we are dealing with much smaller scales than what is seen in the cmb , the behavior of the power spectrum and higher - order correlations on all scales can be computed in any given inflation model .",
    "so , the parameters constrained by probes of very small scales provide complementary constraints on the models . in addition , models where the non - gaussianity changes on small scales typically have correlated changes in the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "the two effects are not arbitrary , as both come from the dynamics of the fields sourcing inflation .",
    "a full study of the relationship between the evolution of the power spectrum and amplitude of non - gaussianity has not yet been done for a very wide variety of models , but see figures 1 and 2 in @xcite for an example .",
    "our joint constraints on the power spectrum and non - gaussianity are particularly valuable for these models .",

    "this plot gives a sense of how accurately the variance of fluctuations must be known in order for number counts to provide an independent constraint on non - gaussianity using petrov expansions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath113 in the left panel of figure [ fig : deltanu ] , then adding weak non - gaussianity in a controlled way has the same effect on the abundance of rare objects as increasing @xmath11 by @xmath114 .",
    "if the uncertainty in @xmath11 exceeds @xmath115 , then number counts with the corresponding value @xmath29 can not independently constrain non - gaussianity without knowing the full pdf of the density fluctuations .",
    "the right hand panel of figure [ fig : deltanu ] shows the maximum fractional change in the abundance @xmath29 that results from adding controlled non - gaussianity for a given object and fixed variance ( so fixed @xmath88 ) : @xmath116/\\beta(0,\\nu_\\mathrm{c})$ ] .",
    "notice that the primary limit on how much @xmath29 can change is our ability to accurately determine the pdf .",
    "since the feeder scaling produces a distribution that is overall much more non - gaussian than the hierarchical for a fixed value of @xmath13 , we can not accurately calculate at as large of @xmath88 ( rarer objects ) or for as large of shifts in @xmath29 as for the hierarchical case .",
    "again , the effects of more non - gaussian distributions can be computed if one knows the full distribution rather than just a finite number of moments .",
    "for a gaussian spectrum of fluctuations , the present - day fractional density of black holes has typically been used to constrain the spectral index @xmath117 under the assumption of a scale - free spectrum @xcite .",
    "the resulting bound , @xmath118 ( based on e.g. veritas searches at @xmath119mpc@xmath1 @xcite ) , is easily satisfied by the current experimentally measured value @xmath120 @xcite , with little or no running . in terms of generalized , scale - dependent gaussian power spectra , pbhs",

    "stronger constraints than this can be found if the analysis is done using a top - hat window function rather than a gaussian , which is arguably a more correct method @xcite .",
    "present observational bounds on pbhs @xcite limit @xmath123 to values ranging from @xmath124 for solar mass pbhs , to @xmath125 for a small range of pbh masses around @xmath126 g , to @xmath127 for even smaller masses .",
    "a pbh mass @xmath128 corresponds to horizon mass @xmath129 @xcite , and therefore wavenumber @xmath130 here @xmath131mpc@xmath132mpc@xmath1 @xcite and @xmath133 @xcite are the wavenumber and horizon mass respectively at equality , and @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 @xcite are the respective degrees of freedom at equality and the time of horizon entry .",
    "we use the current limits on @xmath123 from @xcite , along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalbeta ] ) and the requirement that it represents a well - behaved expansion , to determine the range of values of @xmath137 that are excluded by non - observation of pbhs . for this calculation",

    "we give our limits in figure [ fig : ucmh+pbh ] as a function of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations at any given @xmath37 : @xmath138 we show the excluded areas as dark shaded regions , for both hierarchical and feeder scaling , and at three different example scales .",
    "the corresponding limits on @xmath29 at these scales are @xmath139 ( @xmath140mpc@xmath1 ) , @xmath141 ( @xmath142mpc@xmath1 ) and @xmath143 ( @xmath144mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "more positive non - gaussianity ( larger @xmath48 ) results in stronger exclusions , up until the point at which our expansion eq .",

    "the excluded regions shrink with additional non - gaussianity , as more of the available parameter space is made inaccessible by the increasingly poor behavior of the expansion .",
    "ucmhs were initially discussed in early papers by berezinsky and collaborators @xcite , and have been recently studied in the context of lensing signatures @xcite , gamma - ray and neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation or decay @xcite , and impacts on the cmb @xcite . to date the strongest limits come from gamma - ray observations @xcite , indicating that @xmath145 for a scale - free spectrum , and @xmath146@xmath147 for generalized spectra , on scales corresponding to @xmath148mpc@xmath1",

    "whilst 2-year source searches ( e.g.  @xcite ) and corresponding diffuse data are available , we conservatively adopt 1-year sensitivities to be certain that no dark matter sources were found in the observing period we consider .",

    "our gamma - ray limits assume the canonical thermal cross - section for dark matter annihilation ( @xmath151@xmath152s@xmath1 ) into @xmath153 quarks and anti - quarks , and a relatively conservative dark matter mass of 1tev ( smaller masses would result in stronger limits ) .            in figure [",
    "fig : ucmh+pbh ] , we show the ability of ucmhs and pbhs to exclude different values of @xmath48 for the two scaling scenarios , as a function of the departure of the underlying gaussian power from the current gaussian limit .",
    "dark shaded regions are excluded at 95% confidence level ( cl ) . by expressing the underlying gaussian power _",
    "relative to present limits on gaussian power _ from each class of compact object , it is possible to compare the limits on @xmath154 from ucmhs and pbhs directly . although ucmhs provide a much stronger limit than pbhs on the gaussian power ( as known from @xcite ) , pbhs provide a stronger lever arm for constraining non - gaussianity below their gaussian limit than ucmhs . on the other hand ,",
    "our expansion is well - behaved to larger @xmath48 for ucmhs , allowing them to exclude stronger non - gaussianities than pbhs .",
    "the reference power @xmath155 that we have used for normalising the curves shown in figure [ fig : ucmh+pbh ] is the observational limit on the gaussian power at each scale .",
    "for pbhs at @xmath156mpc@xmath1 , this corresponds to @xmath157 . for ucmhs ,",
    "the limit on the gaussian power is much stronger .",
    "precisely how much stronger depends on the latest redshift at which ucmhs can be assumed to undergo gravitational collapse . assuming that only objects collapsing before a redshift of @xmath158 form ucmhs , the reference power is @xmath159 at @xmath160mpc@xmath1 , and @xmath161 at @xmath162mpc@xmath1 .",
    "setting @xmath158 follows earlier work @xcite , and is a very conservative choice .",
    "the defining characteristic of a ucmh is that it forms in isolation from a spherical collapse ; the processes of radial collapse and secondary infall give ucmhs extremely steep dark matter density profiles , thereby distinguishing them from halos formed at late times .",
    "exactly when the approximation of radial infall breaks down is not yet known @xcite , as this depends sensitively on the velocities of dark matter particles and interactions between growing overdensities .",
    "more detailed simulation work is sorely needed to answer this question . in principle ucmhs",
    "may form at lower redshifts , as long as the presence of different - sized overdensities does not spoil the assumption of spherical collapse .",
    "the smaller the redshift , the more unlikely it is that this requirement will be fulfilled .",
    "later collapse redshifts allow smaller amplitude perturbations to form ucmhs , reducing @xmath21 and increasing @xmath163 for a given combination of @xmath48 and @xmath164 .",
    "if ucmhs continue to be formed as late as @xmath165 , their non - observation begins to constrain non - gaussianities on small scales , even if the power spectrum is near the level observed on cmb scales : @xmath166 at @xmath160mpc@xmath1 , and @xmath167 at @xmath162mpc@xmath1 .",
    "we stress again however , that there exists _ no observational evidence whatsoever _ that the power on small scales is actually this low ( see figure [ fig : planckps ] ) ; even with a very conservative collapse redshift of @xmath158 ucmhs therefore place significant new constraints on non - gaussianity at small scales .",
    "we have provided a general technique for using the abundance of any object to constrain weakly non - gaussian statistics of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "we suggest precise criteria for the amplitude of non - gaussianity that can be accurately constrained using petrov - type expansions and emphasize that there is not a one - to - one mapping between the overall level of non - gaussianity and the size of the skewness ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is important when using the abundance of rare objects to constrain non - gaussianity : number counts are sensitive to _ any _ deviation from gaussianity , but a measured value of @xmath29 does not constrain a parameter like @xmath42 ( typically interpreted as the amount of skewness ) without additional information about the higher moments of the pdf .    in general pbhs",
    "provide stringent constraints on non - gaussianities only in the presence of fluctuations with relatively large variance , from @xmath168 at intermediate ( @xmath160mpc@xmath169 ) and small ( @xmath170mpc@xmath169 ) scales , to @xmath171 at very small scales .",
    "notably though , at very small scales pbhs provide the only available limit on the allowed amount of non - gaussianity .",
    "ucmhs provide stronger constraints , and so may be more likely to eventually also constrain non - gaussianity , but do not reach as small scales as pbhs .    for both ucmhs and pbhs , it is straightforward to map our constraints on @xmath13 to constraints on a non - gaussian parameter in the primordial fluctuations .",
    "for example , for the local ansatz @xmath172 $ ] the smoothed , integrated , dimensionless skewness @xmath173 @xmath174 is very nearly equal to @xmath175 .",
    "for this case , if the variance is large enough , the abundance of ucmhs constrains @xmath176 and pbhs constrain @xmath177 on smaller scales .",
    "however , it is important to remember that this does not mean ucmhs are less powerful  quite the opposite . for the constraint from either object",
    ", the maximum value of @xmath42 corresponds to @xmath178 , so those values of @xmath42 correspond to equally non - gaussian distributions .",
    "the difference in constraints phrased as a value of @xmath42 comes from the difference in the variance of the fluctuations .",
    "for reference , recall that on cmb scales , where the amplitude of fluctuations is currently measured , @xmath179 corresponds to @xmath180 .    to constrain non - gaussianity ,",
    "both pbhs and ucmhs require significantly more power than extrapolating the cmb spectrum from the standard six parameter fit would suggest , but pbhs require even more power than ucmhs .",
    "so , given a prediction for the power on small scales , ucmhs are more likely to constrain non - gaussianity .",
    "in addition , current observational constraints on cosmological models that allow more than six parameters show that additional power on small scales is hardly ruled out .",
    "figure [ fig : planckps ] shows the power spectra allowed by fits to the _ planck _ satellite data @xcite .",

    "cmb @xmath5-distortion can also constrain non - gaussianity , but the nature of the constraints on both characteristics is qualitatively different . first , cmb @xmath5-distortion is sensitive to the total power in fluctuations over a wider range of scales , while the objects are sensitive to the power only very near the scale of the object , @xmath194 .",
    "second , @xmath5-distortion is sensitive to only the squeezed limit of the bispectrum rather than the total skewness .",
    "that is , this measurement can constrain the amplitude in the correlation of three momentum modes with @xmath195 @xcite . if non - gaussianity follows the local ansatz ( which has a strong signal in the squeezed bispectrum ) , a futuristic cmb probe like pixie @xcite could constrain @xmath196 for a scale - invariant power spectrum and @xmath179 for an enhanced small - scale power spectrum that saturates current bounds ( @xmath197 in both cases ) @xcite . as can be seen from the top two panels in figure [ fig : ucmh+pbh ] ,",

    "<S> we describe a general procedure for using number counts of any object to constrain the probability distribution of the primordial fluctuations , allowing for generic weak non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this procedure to use limits on the abundance of primordial black holes and dark matter ultracompact minihalos ( ucmhs ) to characterize the allowed statistics of primordial fluctuations on very small scales . </S>",
    "<S> we present constraints on the power spectrum and the amplitude of the skewness for two different families of non - gaussian distributions , distinguished by the relative importance of higher moments . </S>",
    "<S> although primordial black holes probe the smallest scales , ultracompact minihalos provide significantly stronger constraints on the power spectrum and so are more likely to eventually provide small - scale constraints on non - gaussianity . </S>"
