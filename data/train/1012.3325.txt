    "in 2003 , the bes collaboration observed a significant narrow near - threshold enhancement in the proton - antiproton ( @xmath0 ) invariant mass spectrum in the radiative decay @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the enhancement can be fitted with either an @xmath17-wave or a @xmath18-wave breit - wigner resonance function . in the case of the @xmath17-wave fitted form ,",
    "the mass and the width are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . in 2005 ,",
    "the bes collaboration observed a resonance state @xmath8 in the @xmath21 invariant mass spectrum in the process @xmath22 with the breit - wigner mass @xmath23 and the width @xmath24 , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath8 was confirmed by the bes collaboration in the radiative decay @xmath25 with a statistical significance larger than @xmath26 , the fitted mass and width are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the mass is consistent with the besii result @xcite , while the width is significantly larger .",
    "furthermore , the bes collaboration observed two new resonances @xmath11 and @xmath9 in the @xmath29 invariant mass spectrum with statistical significances larger than @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the measured masses and widths are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite .",
    "many theoretical works were stimulated to interpret the nature and the structure of the new resonance @xmath8 , such as the @xmath0 bound state @xcite , the pseudoscalar glueball @xcite , and the radial excitation of the @xmath36 @xcite , the threshold cusp @xcite , etc .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "liu , ding and yan study the decay widths of the second and the third radial excitations of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath37 and @xmath36 with the @xmath38 model , and observe that the interpretation of the @xmath39 and @xmath8 as the second radial excitations of the @xmath37 and @xmath36 crucially depends on the measured mass and width of the @xmath39 , and suggest that there may be sizable @xmath0 content in the @xmath8 , and the @xmath11 and @xmath9 can not be understood as the third radial excitations of the @xmath37 and @xmath36 respectively , the @xmath9 probably is a mixture of the @xmath40 and glueball .    in ref.@xcite",

    "the strong couplings to the virtual intermediate hadronic states ( for example , the @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc ) can change the bare masses which originate from the quark - gluon interactions significantly , and enrich the pure @xmath47 states with some baryon - antibaryon components . in the present case , the input parameters of the bethe - salpeter equation should be readjusted to obtain reasonable predicted masses if the coupled - channel effects are considered .",
