    "recently , some of the strongly correlated materials are attracting renewed interests because of a possibility for a new and efficient themoelectric device.@xcite especially , the compounds called as the kondo insulators@xcite show rather large thermopower at low temperatures , being suitable for a refrigerator without coolant in the lower temperature range .",
    "it seems , however , that the theory for the thermoelectric effects has not yet been fully developped for the insulators and for the systems with strong correlation .    in this article",
    ", we will focus on the theory of the thermoelectric effect in insulators and point out for the first time that the famous kelvin s relations , which were analyzed and established by lord kelvin@xcite 150 years ago , must be modified in the case of the insulators at low temperature limit .",
    "next , we will discuss effects of many - body interactions on the thermoelectric coefficients and give a formula for the heat current .",
    "we will also explain how the behaviour of the thermopower due to the non - interacting electrons or holes in ordinary semiconductors might be changed in the kondo insulators with strong correlations at low temperatures .",
    "lord kelvin@xcite analyzed a system depicted in fig . 1 which consists of the metals a and b. the temperature difference between b and c is set equal to @xmath0 .",
    "( note that the direction of the gradient is opposite to that in ref.@xcite ) a unit charge is quasi - statically moved along the path abcda .",
    "thereby the peltier heat @xmath1 is emitted at b and @xmath2 is absorbed at c. the thompson heat @xmath3 is emitted between bc and @xmath4 is absorbed between ab and cd . on transfering the charge from d to a the work @xmath5 is done outwards due to the thermoelectric voltage .",
    "thus we can set up the following equations to express the first and the second laws of the thermodynamics : @xmath6 @xmath7 and derive the famous kelvin s relations : @xmath8 where the seebeck coefficient is related to @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that the absolute seebeck coefficient is given by @xmath11 for the semiconductors at low temperatures when the carriers are electron - like , hence @xmath12 . here ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the conduction band edge and the chemical potential , respectively .",
    "however , according to the first equation in ( [ eq : onsager ] ) , @xmath15 , whereas @xmath16 must vanish at @xmath17 due to the second equation in ( [ eq : onsager ] ) .",
    "the former means that one can remove finite amount of heat from the body at absolute zero temperature , violating the third law of the thermodynamics .",
    "this contradiction seems to have occured because we have neglected the work necessary to move a negative charge from the bottom of the conduction band at @xmath18 to the region in the middle with the band edge @xmath19 when @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this case",
    ", we have to add a term @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kelvin1 ] ) , which leads to the modified kelvin s relations , @xmath23 @xmath24 in deriving these equations , we have replaced @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the diverging behavior of @xmath26 at low temperature limit can be understood as due to the necessary ` work ' @xmath27 to move a charge from the lower to the higher bottom of the conduction bands at low temperature limit .",
    "the heat which can be removed ( @xmath28 ) must vanish at @xmath21 in this representation , and the finite value @xmath29 is an artifact of regarding the work to be done as the heat to be removed .",
    "( see fig.[fig : cooling ] to understand how the cooling apparatus works as a thermodynamic cycle . )",
    "onsager s relation ( eq.([eq : onsager ] ) ) does not hold , since the linear response theory is not applicable in the present case at @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 still holds but @xmath31 at @xmath21 . note that the equations ( [ eq : neweq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : neweq2 ] ) hold only at the low temperature limit and a more general expressions at arbitrary temperature are still to be found .",
    "thereby , the inclusion of the nonequilibrium effects will be necessary .     and",
    "@xmath19 , when a positive charge is moved from left to right.,width=302 ]",
    "a general theory for the thermoelectric transport has been developped by mahan,@xcite and recently by kontani@xcite further , based on the fermi liquid theory .",
    "it should be noted that the heat conveyed by the carriers is not equal to @xmath32 but a correction due to the interaction exists .",
    "for example , the heat current is given by @xmath33 for the hubbard model , where @xmath34 denotes the fourier transformation from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the seebeck coefficient , however , can be expressed by the following simple formula @xmath37 with @xmath38 ^ 2/\\pi n$ ] when the vertex corrections ( vc s ) can be neglected , as would be the case for the heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "vc s can not be neglected for high @xmath39 cuprates.@xcite it should be noted that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat - current ] ) due to the interaction does not appear in the factor @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seebeck - boltzmann ] ) .",
    "it is because all the interaction effects were absorbed in the green s function ( and in the vc s ) .",
    "the electronic states of the kondo insulators can be described most simply by the periodic anderson model at half - filling .",
    "( a more realistic model will be discussed in @xcite . )",
    "the coulomb interaction between f - electrons produces a finite imaginary part of the self - energy at finite temperatures .",
    "this makes the quasi - particle density of states finite within the gap at @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the seebeck coefficient of the kondo insulators becomes metal - like @xmath42 at low but finite temperatures,@xcite whereas @xmath43 at higher temperatures .",
    "it could be the case that @xmath26 vanishes as an activation type @xmath44 at the low temperature limit .",
    "these predictions are qualitatively consistent with the observed behaviors,@xcite but the effect of the nonstoichiometry may not be neglected .",
    "both interpretations seem possible for analyzing the experimental results .",
    "the thermoelectric effect in insulators or semiconductors was reinvestigated theoretically .",
    "it was found that the famous relations established by lord kelvin for the thermoelectric coefficients must be modified at low temperature limit in order to be consistent with the third law of the thermodynamics .",
    "many - body effect was also discussed and it was noted that @xmath42 or @xmath45 at low temperatures due to the interaction effect . to elucidate the low temperature behavior , it may be necessary to consider the nonequilibrium effect of coupled electron and phonon systems .",
