    "the conventional understanding about heavy - ion collisions is that when there is a hard scattering of partons , a high-@xmath0 jet is created and one studies the correlation of hadrons either within the same jet or on opposite sides .",
    "the unconventional scenario is that it is possible to detect a high-@xmath0 hadron without an identifiable high-@xmath0 jet , and thus there would be no correlation of particles above the background .",
    "both possibilities will be covered in this review .",
    "the former is important because that is how we learn about the properties of the hot and dense medium through jet quenching .",
    "the latter cautions us from regarding every high-@xmath0 particle as being a part of a jet . whether correlation exists or not depends on the hadron species , the medium from which they are produced , the kinematical region where they are detected , etc . but most important of all is the dynamical properties of the partons just before and during hadronization .",
    "thus both possibilities are essential to a complete understanding of the medium created in heavy - ion collisions .    for jet correlation",
    "we consider near- and far - side correlations in @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , as well as auto - correlation . for no jet correlation",
    "there are three areas where the phenomenon is expected to occur : @xmath2 and @xmath4 production , @xmath5 and @xmath6 production at large @xmath3 , and at large @xmath0 at lhc . only ideas and results will be presented here , quantitative details being referred to the original papers .",
    "since most of the existing data on jet correlation are for @xmath7 gev / c , and for @xmath8 even lower , fragmentation is not a reliable mechanism for hadronization at those intermediate momentum ranges @xcite .",
    "most of the quantitative calculations that can reproduce the data are based on the recombination model ( rm ) .",
    "we give here a brief overview of such studies .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution of associated particles in the same jet that contains the trigger particle has been calculated in the rm , where the thermal - shower parton recombination plays the dominant role @xcite . the results are shown in fig .  1 for both ( a ) @xmath9 and ( b ) @xmath10 collisions at 200 gev at various centralities . evidently , there is little dependence on centrality in @xmath9 collisions , but significant dependence in @xmath10 collisions .",
    "those results are in accord with the data .",
    "2 shows the recent data from star presented at hp06 @xcite .",
    "the solid line for @xmath11 correlation @xcite agrees well with the square points for @xmath12 correlation in @xmath10 collisions .              on the away side",
    "there are data for @xmath13 gev / c and @xmath14 gev / c from star @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "3 . from the ratio of @xmath15 shown in",
    "( d ) it is clear that there is suppression at @xmath16 gev / c but enhancement at @xmath17 gev / c .",
    "that is quite understandable as the consequence of jet quenching in the higher @xmath8 region and soft - parton regeneration in the lower region .",
    "so far there has been no quantitative theoretical calculation that reproduces these properties of the data .",
    "gev / c and @xmath18 gev / c @xcite.,width=188 ]    for jet tomography it is necessary to go to higher trigger momentum , where the medium modified fragmentation function can be more reliably applied @xcite .",
    "star has data with @xmath19 in the 8 - 15 gev / c range @xcite .",
    "the away - side jets show diminishing peak heights as @xmath8 is increased . to quantify that behavior",
    "the trigger - normalized fragmentation function @xmath20 is studied , where @xmath21 is the trigger - normalized momentum fraction @xmath22 , proposed by wang @xcite .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "4 is @xmath20 vs @xmath21 on the away side for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the straight lines are drawn to indicate the universality of the @xmath21 dependence among @xmath24 and @xmath25 collisions , claimed by star , if the points at @xmath26 are ignored .",
    "it seems that if the lowest point for @xmath9 min bias is also ignored , the best fit for that collision system would be a straight line with a lower slope , in comparison with which the data points for the @xmath25 system would fall off faster with @xmath21 . to focus on the ratio @xmath27 , as shown in the lower panel of fig .  4 , may be misleading , since all three @xmath20 deviate strongly from linear extrapolations at @xmath28 , while their ratios reveal no such deviation .",
    "our point here is to register an alert for the possible transition of the hadronization mechanism between @xmath29 and @xmath30 regions .",
    "the higher @xmath21 region is dominated by fragmentation and exhibits universality , while the lower @xmath21 region shows signs of enhancement due to the contribution from recombination .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath31 ratio should be measured on the away side .",
    "its dependence on @xmath21 would reveal the proportion of the two mechanisms : the larger @xmath32 is , the more is the participation of recombination , which is a property of the rm that has been established in the study of single - particle distributions @xcite .          turning next to the correlation in @xmath3 and @xmath2 on the near side ,",
    "we recall the characteristic of the star data @xcite that show a peak in @xmath35 sitting on top of a pedestal that stretches over the interval @xmath36 . the pedestal may well be influenced by the effect of longitudinal expansion @xcite . in the rm",
    "we have been able to reproduce both the peak and the pedestal , as shown in fig .",
    "5 @xcite , by relating the thermalization of the soft partons generated by the energy loss of the hard parton to the pedestal with @xmath37 mev .",
    "the peak is due to the recombination of the secondary shower parton with the thermal parton , the primary shower parton being responsible for the trigger particle .",
    "the prediction for the distribution in @xmath38 agrees well with the data @xcite . at higher trigger momentum",
    "the hard partons originate closer to the surface , so less energy is lost to the medium , and the pedestal phenomenon goes away .",
    "compared to the near - side correlation , there are far more theoretical studies done on the @xmath38 distribution on the away side , since that is where the properties of hard parton propagating through a dense medium are revealed .",
    "various suggestions have been made , such as mach cone , cherenkov gluons and radiation , color wake , jet quenching and fragmentation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most of the suggestions describe the collective response of the medium to the passage of a hard parton .",
    "such a response , especially in the case of mach cone , would result in enhancement of hadron production on both side of the recoil jet in every triggered event so that the @xmath38 distribution would exhibit a double bump structure around @xmath39 , as has been observed for @xmath40 and @xmath41 gev / c @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the problem is presented by chiu at this meeting @xcite .",
    "a parton multiple scattering model is constructed to reproduce the dip - bump structure in the data of @xcite by allowing the recoil parton to undergo multiple scattering as it traverses the dense and expanding medium with random scattering angle in the forward cone at each step .",
    "the parton loses energy at each step so it may be absorbed by the medium if the trajectory has a long path length .",
    "the exit tracks have the characteristics that they bend persistently in one direction and leave the medium in a few steps . while each track in this semi - classical description may not be realistic , the general features after averaging over all tracks present a sensible modeling of deflected jets .",
    "the main phenomenological feature is that there is at most one deflected jet per triggered event , but the event - averaged @xmath38 distribution exhibits the symmetrical dip - bump structure around @xmath42 , as shown in fig .",
    "the dashed line is the pedestal due to thermalized soft partons generated by energy loss .",
    "the solid line above the pedestal describes the hadron distribution due to the exit partons .",
    "when the event generator is applied to the case with higher trigger momentum in the range @xmath43 gev / c @xcite , there is only one peak on the away side at @xmath39 , with its height and width in agreement with the data shown in fig .  7 for ( a ) @xmath44 gev / c and ( b ) @xmath45 gev / c .",
    "distribution on the away side .",
    "data are from @xcite . dashed line is the calculated pedestal , and solid line includes the deflected jets @xcite.,width=302 ]     distribution on the away side for @xmath46 gev / c and ( a ) @xmath47 gev / c and ( b ) @xmath48 gev / c.,width=302 ]      the advantage of studying autocorrelation is that two particles are treated on the same footing and that a larger set of angular relationships between two shower partons in the same jet is included in the study of correlation compared to the analysis in which one particle is treated as a trigger and the other as the associated particle . the usual correlation function ( cumulant ) , @xmath49 , is defined in terms of the momenta @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the two particles , which in turn can be expressed in terms of angular differences and sums @xmath52 , ignoring their magnitudes if the emphasis is on @xmath33 and @xmath34 analysis .",
    "autocorrelation @xmath53 is the integral of @xmath54 over @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "no ambiguous subtraction procedure is used .",
    "data from star have been analyzed yielding a wealth of information on autocorrelation @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath57 @xcite.,width=226 ]    in the rm autocorrelation is studied by considering two shower partons in a jet oriented in all possible directions in the jet cone .",
    "they hadronize by recombination with thermal partons for @xmath0 in the intermediate region @xcite . in fig .  8",
    "is shown the normalized autocorrelation function for the width of the jet cone being @xmath58 .",
    "of course , other values of @xmath59 can be considered , resulting in different shapes of @xmath53 .",
    "that is where one envisions the possibility of extracting the width of the jet cone from the data by comparing the structure in fig .  8 , or its projections to either @xmath60 or @xmath61 , with similar experimental plots .",
    "so far the data on autocorrelation is for @xmath0 too low to be used meaningfully in the above sense , since there is no significant contribution of shower partons at low @xmath0 .",
    "before we go into specific problems that depart from the conventional situation where correlation always accompanies hadrons produced at high @xmath0 , let us discuss in general the physics of hadron correlation at high @xmath0 . as we have seen in the previous section , when an event is triggered by a high @xmath0 particle",
    ", it is usually due to a jet that supplies not only the trigger particle , but also other particles in the same jet , as well as a recoil jet that sends particles in roughly the opposite direction .",
    "thus the detection of high-@xmath0 particles is a necessary consequence of high-@xmath0 partons , but is it sufficient ? as for how high is `` high @xmath0 '' , we first consider the case where @xmath0 is around 4 gev / c at rhic , and later between 10 and 20 gev / c at lhc .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for single - particle inclusive distribution in the @xmath62 gev / c range the dominant mechanism of pion production in @xmath63 collision at 200 gev is the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons .",
    "that is the way that the medium effect is taken into account in the rm for the production of high-@xmath0 pions and protons .",
    "the recombination of thermal partons among themselves is important at lower @xmath0 .",
    "the shower partons are generated by high @xmath0 partons in hard scattering , so indeed the pions and protons produced at high @xmath0 are the necessary consequences of high-@xmath0 partons .",
    "but what if the hard scattering processes are suppressed for dynamical and kinematical reasons ? then in the absence of shower partons the thermal partons would emerge as the only partonic source for hadronization even for particles at @xmath64 gev / c or higher .",
    "although the consideration here is only for single - particle distribution , it is clear that the nature of correlation would be drastically altered when the suppression of hard scattering removes the dynamical origin of high-@xmath0 correlation of the usual kind .",
    "indeed , one should not expect any correlation if the particles produced are of thermal origin .",
    "the scenario described above turns out to show up in two cases : @xmath2 and @xmath4 production at mid - rapidity , and @xmath6 and @xmath5 production at forward rapidity .",
    "another special case involves not so much the lack of hard scattering , but too many of them at lhc . in that case correlation can not stand out above the background , so the detection of dynamical correlation should yield null result .        since @xmath2 and @xmath4 are made of strange quarks only , if they are to be produced by hard scattering , the relevant processes involve either ( a ) a high-@xmath0 non - strange parton that creates an @xmath65 shower parton , or ( b ) a high-@xmath0 @xmath65 parton by direct scattering . in the former case the @xmath66 showering process",
    "is suppressed , while in the latter case the direct production of high-@xmath0 @xmath65 quark is suppressed . in either case",
    "the distribution of @xmath65 shower parton is weak , so thermal - shower recombination is not important in the intermediate @xmath0 region . that leaves only the thermal @xmath65 partons to recombine to form @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "in fig .  9 are shown the @xmath0 distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath4 for all combinations of thermal @xmath67 and shower @xmath68 recombination @xcite , assuming @xmath69-function for the recombination functions .",
    "notice how much lower the contributions involving @xmath70 are compared to the dashed lines that are nearly completely covered by the solid lines that represent the sums .",
    "thus in the intermediate @xmath0 region those distributions are approximately exponential , which reveals he thermal nature of the recombining partons .",
    "the agreement with the existing data in feb 2006 is excellent .",
    "subsequently , star has extended those data to higher @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "10 @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath2 points at high-@xmath0 deviates from the straight - line extrapolation of @xcite , although the @xmath4 points seem to retain the exponential behavior out to 5.5 gev / c .",
    "the theoretical reason for the up - bending of @xmath2 is currently under investigation .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 being linearly rising up to @xmath72 gev / c is nevertheless very remarkable .",
    "the linearity of the line in the inset is due to dimensional differences in the equations for 2 and 3-quark recombination of thermal partons , but the significance is in the thermal nature of the partons .",
    "thus we find that the @xmath65 quarks are thermal out to 2 gev / c , a range of validity far wider than one normally associates with statistical distribution for @xmath73 gev / c .",
    "one may infer from this result that the medium has the characteristics of a quark - gluon plasma , which are : ( a ) strange quarks are enhanced , and ( b ) they are thermalized .",
    "now let us return to the issue about correlation .",
    "since figs .",
    "9 and 10 indicate that the spectrum of @xmath4 is exponential out to @xmath74 gev / c , a property that is interpreted in the rm as being of thermal origin without the involvement of hard partons , then there can be no hadrons correlated with the observed @xmath4 up to 6 gev / c that are not in the background @xcite .",
    "this prediction is currently under active investigation by star .",
    "the production of hadrons at large @xmath3 is another situation where hard scattering is suppressed .",
    "if the hadronization process is fragmentation , then a hard parton must first be scattered to nearly the kinematical boundary in order for it to fragment to a hadron at large @xmath3 .",
    "but since such hard scattering must vanish at the kinematical boundary , it is highly suppressed just inside the boundary . on the other hand , hadronization by recombination",
    "involves the additivity of parton momenta so nothing needs to vanish ; indeed , the distribution of produced hadron can vary smoothly across the kinematical boundary separating the fragmentation region ( fr , @xmath75 ) and the trans - fragmentation region ( tfr , @xmath76 ) @xcite . for example , three quarks at @xmath77 can recombine and form a baryon at @xmath78 .",
    "that is not possible in @xmath79 collisions , since all three forward moving quarks must come from the projectile proton .",
    "but in @xmath80 collisions the three quarks can originate from different nucleons in the projectile nucleus , so each having @xmath77 is not forbidden .",
    "there are two complications in forward production at moderate @xmath0 in @xmath80 collisions that are absent at high @xmath0 and mid - rapidity .",
    "one is the degradation of longitudinal momentum that has been referred to as `` baryon stopping '' in an archaic language .",
    "the other is the regeneration of soft partons due to energy loss by the leading partons .",
    "the former has been studied in detail in @xmath79 collisions @xcite and then in @xmath80 collisions @xcite .",
    "the latter is considered in @xcite .",
    "the regeneration of soft partons does not matter too much to the production rate of forward proton , for which valence quarks dominate , but its effect on pion production is significant . since these are non - perturbative processes , the calculations are model dependent and data guided .",
    "the most recent data that are relevant are from brahms for @xmath81 at @xmath82 gev @xcite , where the @xmath0 distribution is given . with both @xmath3 and @xmath0 known ,",
    "it is possible to determine @xmath83 .",
    "unfortunately , just as @xmath83 approaches 1 , the analysis of the @xmath0 distribution is stopped , although events have been detected with some particles having @xmath84 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath0 up to 2.2 gev / c , the charged particle spectrum shows exponential behavior @xcite ; it corresponds to @xmath83 in the mid - fragmentation region between 0.4 and 0.9 .",
    "our study in the rm has been able to reproduce both the @xmath0 distribution and the @xmath31 ratio @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "there are no shower partons contributing because hard scattering is suppressed in the fr . the solid line in fig .",
    "10 for @xmath85/2 $ ] that includes @xmath86 and @xmath87 approximates the average charged particles , based on @xmath5 and @xmath6 distributions that are determined by the recombination of thermal partons only , including the regenerated soft partons .",
    "the agreement with data is good .",
    "note that the @xmath31 ratio in fig .",
    "12 reaches as high as 2 at @xmath88 gev / c .",
    "that is impossible by parton fragmentation , but in recombination it is actually difficult to keep it as low as 2 unless there is substantial regeneration of antiquarks .",
    "the reason is that valence quarks dominate in the fr so the formation of proton by recombination is much easier than to form pion due to the scarcity of antiquarks whose density depends sensitively on the regeneration effect .",
    "the degradation factor @xmath89 has been adjusted to reproduce the data @xcite .",
    "since no shower partons are involved in the above calculations , no hard partons are needed for @xmath92 gev / c , neither are they available due to the suppression of hard scattering in the forward region .",
    "thus there are no jets , and one should not expect to observe any hadrons correlated at any @xmath0 .      at lhc",
    "it is predicted that there can be a large number of jets , yet no jet structure is likely to be observed @xcite .",
    "that is very peculiar , and therefore interesting to verify .",
    "the reasoning is very nearly the opposite of those in the previous two subsections .",
    "it is anticipated that the jet multiplicity is high at lhc , roughly 100 in @xmath93 .",
    "since the shower partons generated by a high-@xmath0 parton are distributed in a jet cone of non - negligible size , the overlap of jet cones of neighboring jets is unavoidable when the density of jets is high .",
    "the probability of that overlap may be difficult to calculate , but given two or three colinear partons arising from two adjacent jets , their recombination to form pion and proton is easy to calculate in the rm .",
    "thus if we allow the overlap probability @xmath94 to vary over a wide range , from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , we can determine the range of single - particle distribution of @xmath6 and @xmath5 in the region @xmath97 gev / c , high enough to leave out the thermal partons , and low enough to have high jet density .",
    "in @xcite such a calculation has been done with the results shown in fig .",
    "the parameter @xmath98 refers to the suppression factor of hard partons emerging from the super - dense medium , and is related to @xmath99 . at rhic",
    "it is @xmath100 @xcite . since it is unknown at lhc , two reasonable values",
    "are used in fig .  13 .",
    "the more important dependence of the distributions is on @xmath94 .",
    "the pion distributions in the left panel reach their limiting behavior of no 2-jet recombination at @xmath101 , but the proton distributions on the right continue to decrease in magnitude at small @xmath94 .",
    "the interpretation is that proton is so much more abundantly produced because of 3 quark recombination that even at @xmath101 the 2-jet contribution is larger than the 1-jet contribution , which is for @xmath102 ( not shown ) . since it is expected that @xmath94 decreases with @xmath0 , a form @xmath103",
    "is used to see how the distributions approach the 1-jet limit at high @xmath0 . that is shown by the heavy lines in fig .",
    "for @xmath6 they approach the limiting curves before @xmath0 reaches 20 gev / c , but for @xmath5 they do not .",
    "since for @xmath104 gev / c the average jet multiplicity is less than 2 in @xmath105 , @xmath106 is expected to decrease much faster than @xmath107 , so the heavy line for @xmath5 should rapidly join the @xmath102 line beyond .        the important phenomenological consequence of the above results is the ratio @xmath32 that is insensitive to @xmath98 . that ratio is shown in fig .",
    "14 . for fixed @xmath94",
    "the curves increase with @xmath0 , reflecting the dominance of 3-quark recombination . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the heavy lines show that @xmath32 decreases from 20 to 5 , but is significantly higher than that of the one - jet case , shown by the light solid lines in the same figure .",
    "such a large @xmath31 ratio at such a high region of @xmath0 is a result that differs spectacularly from what one expects from fragmentation in the conventional approach to high-@xmath0 physics .",
    "in addition to the surprisingly large @xmath31 ratio , there is also the unusual correlation characteristics . at rhic , where there is a jet , there are correlated hadrons . but at lhc so many jets are produced , they are part of the background . since hadrons in the @xmath109 gev / c range are not the fragments of any super - hard parton at much higher @xmath0 , but are the recombination products of semihard partons at lower @xmath0 that are numerous in every event , treating a detected hadron as a trigger does not eliminate any other hadrons formed by other jets in the same event . that is , there are many associated particles , all of which are part of the background .",
    "thus it is not possible to find any correlated particles distinguishable from the background @xcite . that property is independent of @xmath34 , since recoil partons are weaker than the ambient jets produced near the surface on the far side .",
    "data on these predictions can provide crucial guidance to the understanding of high - density medium whose emitted particles at high @xmath0 has usually been described in a framework that may have to be modified ."
