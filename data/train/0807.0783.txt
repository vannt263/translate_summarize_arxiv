    "one of the most important open problems in mathematics is the    ( generalized riemann hypothesis ) every @xmath18 function , associated with a dirichlet character @xmath19 , is zero - free in the open half - plane @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    ", we enlarge the set of @xmath21 to dirichlet series with periodic coefficients , and investigate what can be shown in the opposite direction about zeros in @xmath22 . for the distribution of zeros of these meromorphic functions in the whole complex plane , we refer to chapter 11 of the book by steuding @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be a positive integer .",
    "let @xmath24 be the @xmath23-dimensional hilbert space of dirichlet series @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is a @xmath23-periodic sequence of complex numbers , and with the scalar product given by @xmath25 it is well known that these dirichlet series @xmath2 have a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane with at most one simple pole at @xmath26 .",
    "we shall denote this meromorphic continuation by @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the set of primitive characters that induce the dirichlet characters modulo @xmath23 . for @xmath28 in @xmath27 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the subspace of @xmath24 generated by the functions @xmath30 where @xmath31 divides @xmath32 .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 ( respectively @xmath34 ) the number of zeros of the function @xmath35 in the rectangle @xmath4 , @xmath5 , counted with their multiplicities ( resp . without their multiplicities ) .",
    "we begin with a structural theorem for @xmath24 .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath23 be a positive integer .    1 .   the functions @xmath36 , where @xmath31 runs through the divisors of @xmath23 , and @xmath19 is a dirichlet character modulo @xmath37 , form an orthogonal basis of @xmath24 .",
    "we have the orthogonal decomposition @xmath38    thus every function @xmath1 can be written in a unique way as @xmath39 where the @xmath40 are dirichlet polynomials that satisfy certain specific conditions . ignoring these conditions for the moment",
    ", we get a much larger set of functions , for which we have the following result .",
    "let @xmath41 be a finite set of at least two primitive dirichlet characters , and let @xmath42 be a family of non - zero dirichlet polynomials .",
    "define @xmath43 then there exists a number @xmath44 such that , for all real numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath45 and all sufficiently large @xmath12 , we have @xmath46    for the upper bound for the number of zeros , we come back to the smaller set of dirichlet series with periodic coefficients .",
    "[ thm3 ] let @xmath0 be a non - zero periodic sequence .",
    "then @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    combining these three results",
    ", we finally get the result that motivated this paper .",
    "[ thm4 ] let @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath23-periodic sequence such that @xmath2 does not belong to one of the subspaces @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",

    "thus the functions @xmath58 with @xmath52 turn out to be a kind of `` primitive function '' for all those @xmath1 with @xmath23-periodic @xmath0 , which conjecturally do not vanish in @xmath56 .",
    "we recall that the dirichlet characters are exactly the arithmetic functions which are both periodic and completely multiplicative .",
    "what are the roles of these two properties for the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) ?",
    "what we find here about the zeros of dirichlet series with periodic coefficients , confirms the commonly held idea that in any proof of grh , the euler product , which comes from complete multiplicativity , must play a significant role .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] follows easily from the orthogonal basis of @xmath23-periodic sequences canonically associated with dirichlet characters modulo @xmath23 , which has been used , and perhaps discovered , by codec , dvornicich , and zannier @xcite , lemma 1 .",
    "the case @xmath59 in theorem [ thm2 ] follows from @xcite , theorem 2 , of kaczorowski and kulas .",
    "they use the classical way to get zeros off the critical line , which is to apply a strong joint universal property for the dirichlet l - functions .",
    "but , as far as we know , that method requires that one works within the strip @xmath60 . to get zeros in the half - plane @xmath61 ,",
    "we use here a kind of weak joint universal property for the dirichlet l - functions .",
    "this leads us to add a new tool into the picture : the brouwer fixed point theorem ( see lemma [ lem2 ] ) .",
    "theorem [ thm3 ] is an explicit form of the upper bound of steuding @xmath62 more precisely , the proof of the slightly weaker @xmath63 appears in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the upper bound is stated in theorem 11.3 , but the proof is given only in the analog situation of the extended selberg class . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we give here the details of the proof in our situation of dirichlet series with periodic coefficients , and take the opportunity to make the dependence on @xmath64 explicit .    for theorem [ thm4 ]",
    ", the lower bound @xmath65 appears in the paper of laurinikas @xcite with the condition @xmath66 , and the restriction that the sequence @xmath15 be a linear combination of at least two dirichlet characters modulo @xmath23 .",
    "\\(i ) for a dirichlet character @xmath19 modulo @xmath37 , we denote by @xmath67 the arithmetic function defined by @xmath68 with the usual convention that @xmath69 if @xmath70 is not a positive integer . by lemma 1 of @xcite ,",
    "the functions @xmath67 form an orthogonal basis for the @xmath23-periodic sequences @xmath71 with scalar product @xmath72 .",
    "the result now follows from @xmath73    \\(ii ) we are going to apply part ( i ) and a change of basis in each @xmath51 .",
