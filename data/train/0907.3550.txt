    "the origin and evolution of the galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) @xmath0 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) is one of the most exciting open problems of modern astrophysics . @xmath0",
    "centauri belongs to the galactic gc system but , due to its complex stellar population and unusual large mass ( @xmath5 ) it has been often considered the relic of a larger stellar system , such as a dwarf galaxy ( see lee et al .  1999 ,",
    "villanova et al .  2007 and references therein ) .",
    "in these last few years , the availability of high- accuracy photometry and multi - object spectroscopy prompted the discovery of additional unusual features like the discrete structure of its red giant branch ( rgb  lee et al .",
    "1999 , pancino et al .",
    "2000 , rey et al .",
    "2004 , sollima et al.2005 ) , the peculiar  and still not poorly understood  age distribution ( sollima et al .",
    "2007 , villanova et al .  2007 and references therein ) , the distinct kinematical properties of the various stellar components ( sollima et al .  2005 ) .",
    "an additional level of complexity has been added by the discovery by anderson ( 1997 ) and bedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that , over a range of at least 2 mag , the cluster main sequence ( ms ) splits into two separate sequences , the bluer ms being more metal - rich than the red one ( piotto et al .",
    "apparently , the only way to account for both the spectroscopic and photometric observations is to assume that the blue ms is populated by stars with an extremely large initial helium content ( @xmath6 piotto et al .",
    "2005 , lee et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "@xmath0 cen also displays an  horizontal branch ( hb ) , characterized by a very extended blue tail , with gaps ( see whitney et al .  1994 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 cen , together with ngc 2808 ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 6715 ( rosenberg , recio - blanco & garca - marn  2004 ) , ngc 6388 and possibly ngc 6441 ( busso et al .",
    "2007 ) , shows  stars at the very hot end of its hb ( whitney et al .",
    "1998 , dcruz et al .",
    "this feature consists of a significant number of objects located at hotter effective temperatures than the hot end of the hb observed in other gcs with blue tails , such as ngc 6752 ( momany et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) and fainter than the bluest end of the canonical zero age hb ( zahb ) , by up to about 0.7 mag in the uv photometric filters .",
    "the presence of these peculiar stellar objects can not be explained by canonical stellar evolution ( salaris & cassisi 2005 ) .    a few years after their discovery , brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed to explain the origin of  stars via the  scenario .",
    "this scenario was first envisaged by castellani & castellani  ( 1993 ) , who proposed that stars that lose an unusually large amount of mass along the rgb will leave the branch before the occurrence of the he flash , and will move quickly to the ( helium - core ) white dwarf cooling curve before eventually initiating helium burning .",
    "the evolution of these so - called  differs significantly from that of stars which undergo the helium flash at the tip of the rgb .",
    "in fact , in this case the large entropy barrier of the efficient h - burning shell prevents the products of helium fusion from being mixed within the surface convective region .",
    "these stars will thus evolve to the zahb without any change in their envelope composition .",
    "by contrast , stars that ignite helium on the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling curve have a much less efficient h - burning shell , and will undergo extensive mixing between the he - core and the h - rich envelope , as predicted by sweigart ( 1997 ) and brown et al .",
    "the exact development of the he - flash induced mixing has been investigated on the basis of fully evolutionary models firstly by cassisi et al .  (",
    "2003 ) and more recently by miller bertolami et al.(2008 ) .",
    "the exact chemical composition of the envelope at the end of this process depends on the strength of the he - flash , i.e. on when  along the wd cooling sequence the he ignition occurs .",
    "irrespective of the computational details , all investigations predict a large increase of the surface abundance of he and a significant enhancement of the carbon abundance in the envelope .",
    "an alternative scenario for explaining the presence of  stars is related to the observed split of the ms .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were the first to suggest that  stars are the progeny of the he - rich ms . at odds with the he - flash induced mixing scenario , if  stars were to be explained by the helium - enrichment scenario , their surface he abundance should not exceed the value estimated for the blue ms ( @xmath70.38 ) and c should not be enriched at all .",
    "interestingly enough , we now know that ngc 2808 , the other gc hosting  stars , shows also the splitting of its ms in three distinct sequences ( dantona et al.2005 , piotto et al .  2007 ) .    early spectroscopic measurements for 12  candidates performed by moehler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) confirmed that these stars are indeed both hotter and on average more he - rich than the canonical extreme hb stars . a more recent analysis ( moehler et al .",
    "2007 ) has shown that at least @xmath315% of the hottest hb stars in @xmath0 cen have a surface he abundance larger than predicted by the he enrichment scenario .",
    "in addition , the most he - rich stars also have enhanced surface carbon abundance , in good agreement with the he - flash induced mixing scenario . from these spectroscopic observations",
    ", it appears that the he enrichment scenario can not account for all stars .",
    "quite recently , an additional puzzling result has been obtained by calamida et al .",
    "they measured the ratio of white dwarfs ( wds ) to ms star counts to be is at least a factor of two larger than the theoretical value predicted from the ratio of carbon - oxygen ( co ) core wd cooling times to ms lifetimes .",
    "this discrepancy can be solved only by assuming the presence of a significant fraction ranging from 10% to 80% , depending on their masses of he - core wds .",
    "to gain additional information about the evolutionary properties of the various subpopulations harbored by this cluster , we take advantage of a rich and nearly complete acs on board hst photometric optical data - set for the hb of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the color - magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) shows a prominent and well populated feature at the faint end of the hb .",
    "the density of stars in this feature is definitely higher than immediately beyond its brighter , cooler end .",
    "our aim is to investigate how this feature relates to the  discovered in uv filters and , more generally , what are the constraints imposed by the observed hb population on the progeny of the blue ms subpopulation .",
    "section  2 describes the data and an analysis of the  population based on the comparison with suitable evolutionary models . in section  3 ,",
    "we compare observed star counts along the hb with theoretical expectations for the ratio between the progeny of the blue and red main sequences ; a summary follows in section  4 .",
    "the data set used in this work consists of a mosaic of @xmath8 fields obtained with the acs / wfc ( go-9442 , pi a.  cool ) through the f435w and f625w filters .",
    "each of these fields has one short ( about 10 s ) and three long exposures ( about 340 s ) in both f435w and f625w .",
    "the acs / wfc mosaic covers the inner @xmath9 centered on the cluster .",
    "the images were reduced and presented in anderson & van der marel ( 2009 ) using the software described in great detail in anderson et al .",
    "briefly , the program finds and measures each star in all exposures simultaneusly by fitting a spatially - variable effective point - spread function .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were transformed into the acs vega - mag flight system following the procedure given in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using the zero points of sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the psfs used here were constructed from the bright , isolated stars in the many exposures , using the approach discusses in anderson & king ( 2006 ) , wherein we model psf as the sum of a spatially variable but temporally constant part and a spatially constant but temporally variable perturbation , to account for breathing - related focus changes .",
    "even this sophisticated model can not account for all the subtle variations of the hst psf , so to deal with the residual psf errors and to account for possible reddening variations across the field , we used a method similar to that adopted in milone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and sarajedini et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "this method involves fitting the average cluster sequence with a msrl ( main - sequence ridgeline ) , examining how the stars within a local region may lie systematically to the blue or red of this sequence , and constructing a spatial correction to remove this systematic trend .",
    "the maximum correction made here was 0.034 mag in color , but is typically less than 0.01 mag .",
    "artificial - star tests indicate that the completeness is greater than 95% for all stars along the hb .",

    "this chemical composition is consistent with the metal content of the main stellar component of @xmath0 centauri ( [ fe / h]@xmath121.7 , e.g.  villanova et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , this reddening corresponds to e(b - v)=0.15 and @xmath14=0.63 using the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction law with @xmath15=3.1 .",
    "the estimated true distance modulus is therefore @xmath16=13.69 .",
    "this quick estimate of distance and reddening is sufficient for the purposes of this investigation , and compares very well with @xmath17 obtained from the work by thompson et al .",

    "we wish to notice here that the models employed in this distance / reddening estimate and in the rest of this paper do not take into account the effect of radiative levitation of metals in the atmospheres of hb stars , that appears to be efficient in objects with @xmath20 hotter than @xmath311@xmath21000  k ( see , e.g. grndahl et al .  1999 ,",

    "figure  [ cmd2 ] displays the fit of our reference zahb ( solid line ) to the photometry of the hb stars .",
    "the constraint on @xmath22 comes essentially from the overdensity of stars at and around the knee of the observed hb distribution [ i.e. , around ( f435w@xmath2f625w)@xmath23 , whereas the reddening is constrained by the fit to the bright vertical part of the blue hb .",
    "the stars at the red end of the knee [ f435w@xmath2f625w ) between @xmath30.3 and 0.5 mag ] appear to be largely evolved off the zahb , and the red part of the hb is only very sparsely populated . beyond the blue edge of the knee",
    "the number of hb stars also decreases sharply .",
    "three selected hb evolutionary tracks for 0.57 , 0.60 and 0.63 @xmath4 are also plotted , to show the approximate mass range corresponding to the knee of the hb distribution . at the blue end of the observed hb we have marked ( thin solid line ) the boundary of a well populated ( about 400 objects ) almost vertical , clump - like feature , that extends also well below the theoretical zahb , by @xmath240.5  mag in f435w .",

(",

    "it is therefore necessary to investigate whether the fraction of hb stars in the  is compatible with the fraction of he - rich stars seen along the ms phase . to answer this question we have estimated theoretically the fraction of hb stars expected to be generated by the he - rich subpopulation .",
    "we have first calculated the differential luminosity function ( i.e. number of stars per magnitude interval ) for both an isochrone with the reference composition and a he - rich one ( same compositin of the he - rich hb models ) from the ms to the tip of the rgb .",
    "we have used a salpeter mass function and assumed that the two populations are coeval , with an age of 13.5  gyr .",
    "the relative number of ms stars in the two populations has been normalized by requiring that the number ratio of the he - rich to the reference ms population is equal to 0.92 , consistent with the value observed in this field by bellini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the stars in the magnitude interval between f435w=20.9 and 22.1 . with the normalization in place ,",
    "the theoretical luminosity functions provide the ratio of objects at the tip of the rgb belonging to the two populations .",
    "this value corresponds , in turn , to the ratio of the rates with which rgb stars of both populations are fed onto the hb .",
    "it turns out that the rate for the he - rich component is about 30% of the value for the reference population .",
    "this result is practically unaffected when we decrease the age by @xmath31  gyr for the he - enhanced population .",
    "an age decrease of this order of magnitude is expected in case the latter population is produced from the ejecta of stars belonging to the reference population .",
    "the result is also only marginally affected by the choice of an initial mass function different than the salpeter s one , because the mass range spanned in the ms normalization is not large .",
    "we have recomputed this ratio using a flat mass function and one with a power - law exponent @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting ratio changes by only @xmath180.5% .    to estimate the relative number of he - rich to reference composition progeny along the hb , is necessary to multiply the 30% value obtained before by the ratio between their hb evolutionary times . from fig .",
    "[ cmd2 ] one can notice that along the hb the progeny of the he - rich population has to be located at f435w fainter than @xmath2417.2 - 17.4 mag , given that at brighter magnitudes the he - rich zahb is overluminous compared to the observed hb .",
    "this corresponds to masses smaller than @xmath33 . at f435w fainter than 17.4  mag",
    "the majority of stars is concentrated in the , and we therefore assume a typical hb mass equal to 0.460@xmath4 for the he - rich progeny ( see fig  [ cmd3 ] ) .    on the other hand , the typical mass of the reference hb component has to be between @xmath30.57 and @xmath30.63  @xmath4 , corresponding to the objects along the extremely well populated knee of the observed hb ( see fig  [ cmd2 ] ) .",
    "masses in this range have all extremely similar central he - burning lifetimes , differing by less than 5% , and as representative value we employed the lifetime of the 0.60 @xmath4 model .    with these estimates the theoretical hb lifetime ratio results to be equal to @xmath31.6 , the he - rich progeny being longer lived .",
    "the expected ratio between the progeny of the he - rich component and the progeny of the reference population is therefore equal to @xmath34 . on the observational side ,",

    "any contamination of the hb at f435w@xmath3517.4 by the progeny of the reference population [ as expected in case moehler et al .",
    "( 2007 ) results were to be valid also for this cluster field ] would exacerbate this discrepancy .",
    "our result implies that at least @xmath315% ( about 100 objects ) of the expected he - rich hb stars are unaccounted for .",
    "this means that their rgb progenitors have lost enough mass to avoid central he - ignition , and ended up along the he - core wd sequence .",

    "<S> we investigate a peculiar feature at the hottest , blue end of the horizontal branch of galactic globular cluster @xmath0 centauri , using the high - precision and nearly complete catalog that has been constructed from a survey taken with the _ advanced camera for survey _ on board the hubble space telescope , that covers the inner @xmath1 arcminutes . </S>",
    "<S> it is a densely populated clump of stars with an almost vertical structure in the f435w-(f435w@xmath2f625w ) plane , that we termed . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with theoretical models leads to the conclusion that this feature must necessarily harbor either hot flasher stars , or canonical he - rich stars progeny of the blue main sequence sub - population observed in this cluster or a mixture of both types , plus possibly a component from the normal - he population hosted by the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a strong constraint coming from theory is that the mass of the objects in the  has to be very finely tuned , with a spread of at most only @xmath30.03  @xmath4 . by comparing observed and theoretical star counts along both the h- and he - burning stages </S>",
    "<S> we then find that at least 15% of the expected he - rich horizontal branch stars are missing from the color - magnitude diagram </S>",
    "<S> . this missing population could be the progeny of red giants that failed to ignite central he - burning and have produced he - core white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion supports the scenario recently suggested by calamida et al .  </S>",
