    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) from molecules has attracted a great deal of attention , due to the amazing application in probing the molecular structure and electron dynamics with attosecond and @xmath0ngstrm resolutions@xcite .",
    "a rich set of new physical phenomena such as the spectral minimum have been experimentally observed @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the target molecules were impulsively excited into a rotational wave packet by a moderately intense pump pulse to achieve the field - free alignment @xcite .",
    "and then a more intense probe pulse at a certain time delay with respect to the pump pulse was focused into these partially aligned molecules to generate the high - order harmonics .",
    "the distribution of the angle between the molecular axis and the polarization of the probe pulse varies with the time delay .",
    "therefore , to simulate these pump - probe experiments , the alignment distribution of the molecules at a certain time delay should be taken into account . in previous theoretical works ,",
    "two alternative methods were adopted to take into account the partial alignment of molecules . in refs.@xcite , a noncoherent superposition of the harmonic intensities convolved with the angular distribution",

    "@xcite , a coherent sum of the harmonic emissions is employed to simulate the hhg from partially aligned molecules .",
    "the spectral minimum is one of the most important phenomena observed in the molecular hhg . both the interference of the harmonic emissions from different nuclei in a molecule and the interference of the harmonic emissions from multiple channels can modulate the harmonic spectrum and induce a spectral minimum @xcite . with a detailed analysis of these minima , the information about the molecular structure and electron dynamics can be extracted @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the harmonic spectrum is also modulated due to the effect of the partial alignment of molecules @xcite , which is inevitable in the actual experiment .",
    "whereas how the interference of the harmonic emissions from molecules at different alignment angles affects the harmonic spectrum is seldom investigated . knowing this interference effect may provide a route to quasi - phase - matching .",
    "moreover , it helps us correctly extract the information about the molecular structure and electron dynamics .    in this paper , we investigate the interference effect of the harmonic emissions from molecules at different alignment angles . by comparing the harmonic spectra obtained with the coherent and noncoherent superpositions of the harmonic emissions with those measured in experiment",

    "we perform a detailed analysis of the interference effect at different time delays and with different degrees of alignment .",
    "it is shown that the anomalous harmonic cutoff phenomenon observed in a recent experiment @xcite and the shift of the spectral minimum position with decreasing the degree of alignment can be explained by the interference effect of the harmonic emissions from molecules at different alignment angles .",

    "an obvious minimum occurs only in the spectrum obtained by employing the coherent superposition . moreover , the spectral minimum position ( 60.3 ev ) is the same as that measured in ref .",
    "therefore , only the coherent superposition of the harmonic emissions from molecules aligned at different angles can fully describe the hhg from partially aligned molecules .",
    "although some features of the hhg can be reproduced by the noncoherent superposition of the harmonic emissions as shown in fig . 1 and",

    "3(a ) , the harmonic emissions near the cutoff exhibit two - center interference minima around @xmath46 , which is accompanied by a phase jump of @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the harmonic emissions are divided by the @xmath46 angle into two parts that have @xmath47 phase difference .",
    "for the first part @xmath48 , the corresponding harmonic phases are around @xmath49 , while for the second part @xmath50 , the phases are around @xmath51 . as a result , when coherently superposing the harmonic emissions at different alignment angles , the interference of the harmonic emissions will modulate the observed spectra , depending on the corresponding angular distribution . in figs .",

    "the co@xmath35 molecules are mostly aligned along the laser polarization direction ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the corresponding weighted angular distribution maximizes at @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",

    "the emissions at the alignment angles below and above @xmath46 contribute almost equally to the high - order harmonics near the cutoff , i.e. the contributions of the two parts with @xmath47 phase difference are comparable .",
    "hence the harmonics near the cutoff are significantly suppressed due to the destructive interference . as a result , the harmonic spectra present cutoff recessions with respect to those around 21.1 ps and 21.81 ps . from the above analysis , one can see that the anomalous cutoff phenomenon results from the interference of the emissions from molecules aligned at different angles .",

    "the associated phase jump by @xmath56 occurs at a small angle .",

    "3(b ) , the angular distribution at the delay 21.1 ps for the co@xmath35 molecules maximizes at @xmath53 .",

    ", the minimum appears at a higher energy 60.3 ev .",
    "hence , the interference of the harmonic emissions at different alignment angles significantly shifts the spectral minimum position .     as 0.57 ( dash - dotted red line ) , 0.50 ( dashed green line ) and 0.43 ( solid blue line ) . the harmonic spectra for @xmath33 as 0.57 and 0.50 are vertically shifted for clarity .",
