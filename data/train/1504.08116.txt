    "random fluctuations due to low - copy number phenomena inside the microscopic cellular volumes have been an object of intense study in recent years .",
    "it is now widely recognized that deterministic modeling of chemical kinetics is in many cases inadequate for capturing even the mean behavior of stochastic chemical reaction networks , and several studies have explored the discrepancy between deterministic and stochastic system descriptions @xcite .    despite the all - pervasive stochasticity , cellular processes and responses proceed with surprising precision and regularity , thanks to efficient noise suppression mechanisms also present within cells .",
    "the structure and function of these mechanisms has been a topic of great interest @xcite , and in many cases still remains unknown .",
    "moreover , recent theoretical works on enzymatic reaction schemes with a single or a few enzyme molecules @xcite have repeatedly shown that low - copy enzymatic reactions demonstrate a stochastic behavior that can lead to markedly different responses in comparison to the predictions of deterministic enzyme kinetic models .    in this work",
    "we investigate the properties of a possible noise suppression mechanism for an enzymatic reaction with a small and fluctuating number of active enzymes . under certain conditions , presented in @xcite",
    ", this system displays an increased sensitivity to enzyme fluctuations , a phenomenon that has been termed _",
    "stochastic focusing_.    stochastic focusing has been presented as a possible mechanism for _ sensitivity amplification _ : compared to a deterministic model of a biochemical network , the mean output of the stochastic version of the system can display increased sensitivity to changes in the input , when the input species has sufficiently low abundance .",
    "consequently , it has been postulated that stochastic focusing can act as a signal detection mechanism , that converts a graded input into a `` digital '' output .",
    "the basic premise of @xcite has been that fluctuations in the `` input '' species are sufficiently rapid , so that any rates that depend on the signaling species show minimal time - correlations .",
    "we show that if this condition fails , i.e.  when the fluctuations in the input signal are slow compared to the average lifetime of a substrate molecule , stochastic focusing can result in a dramatic increase in substrate fluctuations , a fact also acknowledged in the original publication .",
    "increased sensitivity to input changes does not only come at the cost of extremely high output noise levels ; as we will demonstrate here , systems operating in this regime are also extremely sensitive to variations in reaction rates , which in fact precludes robust signal detection by stochastic focusing .",
    "for the first time since its introduction we could study the steady - state behavior of this system analytically , by formulating and solving the equations for the conditional means and ( co)variances @xcite .",
    "motivated by our observations on the open - loop , stochastically focused system , we investigated the system behavior in the presence of a plausible feedback mechanism .",
    "we treated the enzyme as a noisy `` controller '' molecule whose purpose is to regulate the outflux of a reaction product by  directly or indirectly  `` sensing '' the fluctuations in its substrate . for the sake of simplicity and clarity",
    ", we focused on very simple and highly abstracted mechanisms , but we should remark that several possible biochemical implementations of our feedback mechanism can be considered .",
    "our premise was that the great open - loop sensitivity of a stochastically focused system with relatively slow input fluctuations creates a system with very high open - loop gain , which in turn can be exploited to generate a very robust closed - loop system once the output is connected to the input .",
    "our simulation results confirmed this intuition , revealing a dramatic decrease in noise levels and a significant increase in robustness in the steady - state mean behavior of the closed - loop system .",
    "such a system no longer functions as a signal detector , but rather behaves as a strong homeostatic mechanism .",
    "moreover , we observed that the steady - state behavior of the means in a stochastically focused system with feedback can be captured quite accurately by the corresponding deterministic system of reaction rate equations , despite the fact that the stochastic system still operates at very low copy numbers .",
    "noise attenuation through feedback and the fundamental limits of any feedback system implemented with noisy `` sensors '' and `` controllers '' have been studied theoretically in the recent years , and some fairly general performance bounds have been derived in @xcite .",
    "we should note that , despite its generality , the modeling framework assumed in @xcite does not apply in our case , since our system contains a controlled degradation reaction , whereas @xcite considers only control of production .",
    "more specifically , @xcite examines the case where a given species regulates its own production through an arbitrary stochastic signaling network . in this",
    "setting , it is shown that , no matter the form or complexity of the intermediate signaling , the loss of information induced by stochasticity places severe fundamental limits on the levels of noise suppression that such feedback loops can achieve .",
    "on the other hand , it is still unclear what type of noise suppression limitations are present for systems such as the one studied here , and a complete analytical treatment of the problem of regulated substrate degradation seems very difficult at the moment .    a first attempt to analyze the noise properties of regulated degradation was presented in @xcite , which examined such a scheme using the linear noise approximation ( lna ) @xcite . as the authors of that work pointed out , however , the lna is incapable of correctly capturing the system behavior ( i.e. means and variances ) beyond the small - noise regime , due to the nonlinear system behavior .",
    "we verified this inadequacy , not only for lna , but for other approximation schemes as well , such as the langevin equations @xcite and various moment closure approaches @xcite .",
    "perhaps this is the reason why , contrary to regulated production , the theoretical noise properties of regulated substrate degradation have received relatively little attention .    with the rapid advancement of single - molecule enzymatic assays @xcite",
    ", we expect that the study of noise properties of various low - copy enzymatic reactions , including the proposed feedback mechanism described here , will soon be amenable to experimental verification .",
    "it also remains to be seen whether the proposed feedback mechanism is actually employed by cells to achieve noise attenuation in enzymatic reactions . at any rate ,",
    "the noise attenuation scheme presented here could be tried and tested in synthetic circuits through enzyme engineering @xcite .",
    "in this section we formulate and analyze a simple biochemical reaction network capable of exhibiting the dynamic phenomenon of stochastic focusing .",
    "it is shown that in the stochastic focusing regime , the system acts as a noisy amplifier with an inherent strong sensitivity to perturbations .",
    "it follows that without modifications , the network can not be used under conditions requiring precision and regularity .",
    "we consider the simple branched reaction scheme studied in @xcite and shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1_ol](a ) . in this scheme ,",
    "substrate molecules @xmath0 enter the system at a constant influx , and can either be converted into a product @xmath1 or degraded under the action of a low - copy enzyme ( or , equivalently , converted into a product that leaves the system ) .",
    "while the number of enzymes in the system is assumed constant , enzyme molecules can spontaneously fluctuate between an active ( @xmath2 ) and an inactive ( @xmath3 ) form .",
    "the generality of this model and its sensitivity to variations in the active enzyme levels is further discussed in the supplement ( sections 1 and 2 ) .",
    "recent single - enzyme turnover experiments have shown that single enzyme molecules typically fluctuate between conformations with different catalytic activities , a phenomenon called _ dynamic disorder _ @xcite . in the simple model considered here",
    ", the enzyme randomly switches between two activity states .",
    "the stationary distribution of @xmath2 in this case is known to be binomial @xcite ; that is , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total number of enzymes in the system and @xmath6 , such that the mean @xmath7 .",
    "the basic ( empirically derived ) conditions for stochastic focusing @xcite are that the magnitude of active enzyme fluctuations is significant compared to the mean number of active enzymes , while the total number of enzymes is low .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the level of @xmath2 fluctuates rapidly compared to the average lifetime of @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules . without this assumption ,",
    "the noise in @xmath2 can be greatly amplified by @xmath0 and transmitted to @xmath1 .",
    "the first assumption ( large enzyme fluctuations and low abundance ) is maintained in our setup .",
    "however , we shall dispense with the second assumption .",
    "we further postulate that @xmath0 ( possibly a product of upstream enzymatic reactions ) enters the system at a high input flux ( large @xmath8 ) and that there exists a strong coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , in the sense that a few active enzymes can strongly affect the degradation of @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath15 ( strong coupling between enzyme and substrate ) 4 .",
    "@xmath16 is small ( e.g.  below 10 ) .",
    "these conditions are motivated via a short theoretical and numerical analysis in the supplement ( section 1 ) .",
    "when they hold , we expect the amount of @xmath0 to fluctuate wildly as @xmath2 varies over time and these fluctuations to propagate to @xmath1 . in the rest",
    ", we will refer to this motif as the ( open - loop ) _ slowly fluctuating enzyme _ ( sfe ) system .",
    "the computational analysis of this and similar systems has thus far been hindered by the presence of the bimolecular reaction , which leads to statistical moment equations that are not closed @xcite , while the presence of stochastic focusing presents further difficulties for any moment closure method . in this work ,",
    "we circumvent these difficulties by formulating and solving the conditional moment equations @xcite for the means and ( co)variances of @xmath0 and @xmath1 conditioned on the enzyme state ( whose steady - state distribution is known ) .",
    "this enables for the first time the analytical study of the steady - state behavior of this system ( more details can be found in the supplement , section 3 ) .",
    "chiefly , the equations for the first two conditional moments of the sfe system are in fact closed , i.e.  they do not depend on moments of order higher than 2 , and thus do not require a moment closure approximation despite the fact that the unconditional moment equations themselves are open .",
    "we next use these analytic equations to shed new light on the properties of the network under consideration .      according to the method of conditional moments ( mcm ) @xcite ,",
    "the chemical species of a given system are divided into two classes .",
    "species of the first class , collectively denoted by @xmath17 , are treated fully stochastically , while species of the second class , denoted by @xmath18 , are described through their conditional moments given @xmath17 .",
    "more analytically , the mcm considers a chemical master equation ( cme ) @xcite for the marginal distribution of @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and a system of conditional means ( @xmath20 $ ] ) and higher - ordered centered moments ( e.g. conditional variances @xmath21 $ ] ) for the @xmath18 species . in the case of the sfe network , by taking @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we see that @xmath17 is independent of @xmath18 and its evolution is described by a cme whose stationary solution is known . moreover , the system of conditional means and ( co)variances of @xmath18 given @xmath17 turns out to be closed .",
    "we thus begin by examining the behavior of the system as the enzyme activation rate is varied while keeping other parameters unchanged . assuming a fixed @xmath24 , @xmath25 is directly related to @xmath26 , the average number of active enzymes .",
    "thus , any changes in @xmath26 are assumed to be driven by @xmath25 , which means that the two can be used interchangeably .",
    "we present the performance of the open - loop system with respect to @xmath26 wherever possible , as we find this more intuitive .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig1_ol](b ) show that the stationary means of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( denoted by angle brackets throughout the paper ) depend very sensitively on @xmath26 , as one would expect from a stochastically focused system .",
    "moreover , owing to the relatively slow switching frequency of enzyme states , the stationary distributions of substrate and product are greatly over - dispersed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_ol](c ) .    apart from the enzyme activation rate , the catalytic degradation rate ( @xmath27 ) is also expected to affect noise in the system , as it controls both the timescale and magnitude of substrate fluctuations : as @xmath27 increases , the rate of substrate consumption grows as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of a change in the number of active enzymes is also magnified .",
    "we can study the interplay of @xmath25 and @xmath27 by varying both simultaneously , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dscan](a ) .",
    "although @xmath25 has a much more pronounced effect on substrate and product means and variances , the interplay of @xmath27 and @xmath25 is what determines the overall noise strength in the system , as the third row of plots shows .    ) and @xmath27 for @xmath28 ( notice the logarithmic scales ) . *",
    "( b ) * closed - loop sfe system with substrate feedback : steady - state means , variances and cvs of substrate and product as a function of @xmath25 ( which determines the average number of active enzymes ) and @xmath27 for @xmath29 .",
    "logarithmic scales are preserved to make comparisons with fig .",
    "[ 2dscan ] easier , although the range of variation is much smaller in this case . ]    from the above analysis , we deduce that the open - loop motif amplifies both small changes in the average number of active enzymes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1_ol](b ) ) , as well as temporal fluctuations in the active enzyme levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig1_ol](c ) ) : for intermediate values of @xmath25 , the cv and ff of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are much greater than zero .",
    "this implies that the instantaneous flux of substrate through the two alternative pathways experiences very large fluctuations , which would propagate to any reactions downstream of @xmath0 .      the increased sensitivity of the sfe network to fluctuations in the active enzyme would suggest sensitivity with respect to variations in reaction rates . to verify this",

    "that is , every parameter was perturbed according to the following scheme : @xmath30).\\ ] ] for each perturbed parameter set , the steady - state conditional moment equations were solved to obtain the means , variances and noise measures for both the substrate and product .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : pert_open_closed ] ( dashed lines ) , where the large parametric sensitivity of the system can be clearly seen . global sensitivity analysis of the mean , variance and cv histograms @xcite reveals that the total number of enzymes ( @xmath31 ) has the largest effect on all these quantities , with the enzyme activation / deactivation rates ( @xmath32 ) coming at second and third place .",
    "although one could argue that @xmath25 and @xmath24 are biochemical rates that are uniquely determined by molecular features of the enzyme , the total number of enzyme molecules would certainly be variable across a cellular population .    .",

    "the great reduction in sensitivity of the closed - loop sfe system in comparison to the open - loop can be easily observed .",
    "[ fig : pert_open_closed ]    taken together , the results of this section and the previous one suggest that the operation of the sfe reaction scheme in fig .  [ fig1_ol](a ) as a signal detection mechanism ( the original point made in @xcite ) is severely compromised when the system operates in the regime defined by our set of assumptions : besides amplifying enzyme fluctuations , the system responds very sensitively to parametric perturbations .",
    "these features render the enzyme a highly non - robust controller of the substrate and product outfluxes , which can fluctuate dramatically in time .",
    "in addition , reaction rates have to be very finely tuned to achieve a certain output behavior , for example a given mean and variance , or a given average substrate outflux .",
    "it is a well - known fact in control theory that negative feedback results in a reduction of the closed - loop system gain @xcite .",
    "however , this reduction is exchanged for increased stability and robustness to input fluctuations , and a more predictable system behavior that is less dependent on parameter variations .",
    "systems with large open - loop gain tend to also display extreme sensitivity to input and parametric perturbations , and can thus benefit the most from the application of negative feedback .",
    "we shall examine the operation of the sfe network under feedback by assuming that @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) affects the rate of activation of the enzyme , for example by controlling its activation rate .",
    "we will call this new motif the _ closed - loop _ sfe system , to differentiate it from the open - loop system presented above .    according to the closed - loop reaction scheme ( fig .",
    "[ closed_scheme](a ) ) , the activation rate of @xmath3 becomes @xmath34 ( @xmath35 being @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , where @xmath36 models activation by @xmath35 , thus creating a negative feedback loop between the system input and output .",
    "our only requirement for @xmath36 is to be nondecreasing ( e.g.  a hill function ) . to facilitate our simulation - based analysis",
    ", we will assume that @xmath36 arises from the local , piecewise linear approximation of a hill function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ closed_scheme](b ) . in this case , the form of @xmath36 is controlled by two parameters : @xmath37 ( the `` gain '' ) and @xmath38 ( the point beyond which feedback is activated ) .",
    "finally , @xmath25 can be thought of as the `` basal '' activation rate in the absence of the regulating molecule .",
    "we should note that the proposed form of feedback regulation is fairly abstract and general enough to have many alternative biochemical implementations .",
    "it is possible , for example , for the enzyme activity to be allosterically enhanced by the cooperative binding of @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( termed substrate and product activation respectively in the language of enzyme kinetics ) , giving rise to a hill - like relation between effector abundance and enzyme activity @xcite . in this work",
    "we will work with the abstract activation rate function defined above .",

    "we study the sfe network under the influence of negative feedback .",
    "we should point out that we characterize the open- and closed - loop systems with respect to the same features ( noise and robustness ) , not to directly compare them , but because these features play an important role in the function of both mechanisms .",
    "whenever we use the open - loop system as a baseline for assessing closed - loop system properties , scale - independent measures are used since this allows for the evaluation of relative distribution spreads . this principle",
    "is only disregarded in fig .",
    "[ n_pert_cfeed ] below .    for our first test",
    ", we use the same settings and parameters as those of fig .  [",
    "2dscan](a ) , only this time we add a feedback term from the substrate to the enzyme activation rate .",
    "increasing the gain @xmath37 or shifting the activation point @xmath38 to the left results in a decrease of both means and variances of substrate and product .",
    "for the ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath38 values considered , the means change by at most a factor of 2.5 , while the variances by about 5 times . at the same time , the cvs vary by about 50% and the corresponding fano factors by a factor of 5 .",
    "moreover , as the analysis in the supplement ( section 5 ) shows , the cvs of both species become relatively flat as @xmath37 and @xmath38 increase , while the fano factor gets very close to 1 as @xmath37 increases for small values of @xmath38 , indicating that the resulting substrate and product stationary distributions are approximately poissonian in this regime . for the analysis that follows , we fix @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the feedback function @xmath41 .    with the above choice of feedback parameters ,",
    "we first study the sensitivity of the closed - loop sfe system to variations of the two key parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath27 . as fig .",
    "[ 2dscan](b ) demonstrates , means and variances ( and , consequently , cvs ) of substrate and product become largely independent of @xmath25 , except for very large values of @xmath27 ( similar results are obtained for product feedback ) .",
    "moreover , noise of substrate and product is dramatically reduced in comparison to the open - loop sfe system , while the variation of means and variances is now quite small , despite the large ranges of @xmath25 and @xmath27 values considered .",
    "it is also worth noting that the fano factors of both substrate and product are very close to one for a large range of parameters .    interestingly ,",
    "if we quantify noise reduction by the ratio of open - loop vs.  closed - loop cv , we observe that noise reduction is maximal where the open - loop sfe system noise is greatest , as demonstrated by comparing fig .",
    "[ closed_scheme](c ) with fig .",
    "[ 2dscan](a ) .",
    "another striking effect of feedback regulation of enzyme activity is that the closed - loop sfe system becomes much less sensitive to parameter variations in comparison to the open - loop case .",
    "applying the same parametric perturbations described in ",
    "[ sub_pert_open ] , we obtain the histograms of fig .  [",
    "fig : pert_open_closed ] ( continuous lines ) . as it becomes apparent , the histograms corresponding to the closed - loop sfe system are several orders of magnitude narrower compared to the open - loop .",
    "moreover , despite the relatively large parametric perturbations , variability in substrate and product statistics of the closed - loop sfe system is largely contained within an order of magnitude .    as it was pointed out in ",
    "[ sub_pert_open ] , variability in biochemical reaction rates can be considered `` artificial '' , however changes in the number of enzymes , @xmath31 , are to be expected in a cellular population .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study how variations in @xmath31 alone are propagated to the substrate and product statistics . assuming that both the open- and closed - loop systems operate with the same average number of active enzymes for the `` nominal '' value of @xmath42 , fig .",
    "[ n_pert_cfeed](a , b ) shows how the substrate mean and variance vary as @xmath31 is perturbed around this value , both in the open- and closed - loop systems ( with substrate feedback ) . to achieve the same average number of active enzymes for @xmath42 , the closed - loop sfe system was simulated first , and the mean number of active enzymes",
    "was recorded .",
    "this number was then used to back - calculate an appropriate @xmath25 value ( keeping @xmath24 fixed ) for the open - loop sfe system .",
    "panel ( c ) also shows how the distribution of active enzymes differs in the two systems for @xmath42 .",
    "the cyan line corresponds to a binomial distribution , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is determined by the @xmath25 and @xmath24 values of the open loop .",
    "the red distribution is obtained from simulation of the closed loop and is markedly different from a binomial .",
    "the difference is especially significant at the lower end , as small values of @xmath2 lead to fast accumulation of @xmath0 .",
    "similar results are obtained for product feedback .    , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and feedback parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "in the open - loop sfe system all parameters were kept the same , except for @xmath25 , which was set to 0.1572 to achieve the same mean of @xmath2 that the closed - loop sfe system achieves for @xmath42.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      a further remarkable by - product of feedback in the closed - loop sfe system is the fact that the mean of the stochastic model ends up following very closely the predictions of the ode equations for the deterministic system .",
    "this behavior becomes more pronounced as the number of available enzymes ( @xmath31 ) grows , while the average number of active enzymes ( @xmath52 ) remains small . under this condition",
    ", one can think of enzyme activation in the original system as a zeroth - order reaction with rate @xmath53 , and the active enzyme abundance to be described by a birth - death process with birth rate @xmath53 , death rate @xmath24 and poisson stationary distribution with parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the accuracy of the ode approximation to the mean substrate levels in the case of substrate feedback can be demonstrated using the same type of parametric perturbations with those employed in  [ sub_pert_open ] .",
    "all nominal parameters were kept the same for this test , except for @xmath24 , @xmath53 and @xmath27 , which were set equal to 1 , 5 and 100 respectively ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "we compare the mean of the stochastic model with the ode prediction in the case of substrate feedback with @xmath57 , and define the relative error @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the equilibrium solution of the ode model . in this",
    "setting , a set of 5000 random perturbations leads to an average relative error of 1.5% with standard deviation 0.96% , which clearly shows that the ode solution captures the mean substrate abundance with very good accuracy indeed ( note that the same holds for the mean of @xmath1 , since it depends linearly on the mean of @xmath0 ) .",
    "very similar results are obtained in the case of product feedback .",
    "the above observations are even more striking , if we take into account 1 ) the fact that the closed - loop sfe system is still highly nonlinear and 2 ) the intrinsic property of stochastically focused systems to display completely different mean dynamics when compared to the ode solutions .",
    "an explanation of this behavior can be given by examining the moment differential equations . in the limiting case considered in this section , denoting @xmath60 the production rate of active enzyme , we obtain @xmath61    the last two terms on the right - hand side of denote the covariance of the substrate enzymatic degradation rate with active enzyme and the covariance of the enzyme activation rate with the substrate .",
    "both covariances are expected to be positive at steady state , which implies that the terms act against each other in determining the steady - state covariance of substrate and active enzyme . in turn",
    ", a small value of this covariance ( compared to the product @xmath62 ) implies that the mean of @xmath0 can be approximately captured by a mean - field equation , where @xmath63 has been replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "this is indeed the case in our simulations , where @xmath64 turns out to be @xmath652030 times smaller than @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "the open - loop value of @xmath64 is about 30 times larger than the closed - loop one .",
    "this comes as no surprise , as one expects substrate and active enzyme to display a strong negative correlation , which is the cause of the discrepancy between stochastic and deterministic descriptions of stochastically focused systems .",
    "similar observations can be made when @xmath31 is small ( e.g.  around 10 ) , however the relative errors become at least one order of magnitude larger .",
    "we believe that this can be attributed to the fact that the enzyme activation propensity depends both on the abundance of inactive enzyme and the substrate / product abundance , which increases the inaccuracy of the odes .",
    "as we have already demonstrated , the closed - loop sfe system is remarkably robust to parametric perturbations of the open - loop model .",
    "however , in all of our numerical experiments we have kept the parameters of the feedback function @xmath36 fixed to a few different values . here",
    "we examine the opposite situation , in which only the controller parameters are free to vary while the rest are held constant .",
    "we therefore consider the problem of regulating the mean of @xmath0 around a fixed value with feedback from @xmath0 .",
    "the problem can be posed as follows : @xmath66 where both the mean and variance of @xmath0 depend on the feedback function parameters .",
    "[ optimal_feedback ] shows the contour lines of @xmath67 , obtained via stochastic simulation over a wide range of @xmath37 and @xmath68 values for @xmath69 .",
    "it can be observed that @xmath67 is more sensitive to @xmath68 than @xmath37 : beyond a certain @xmath37 value , the function quickly levels off .    based on our simulation runs",
    ", the optimal feedback parameters turned out to be @xmath70 ( the maximum @xmath37 value considered for the plot ) and @xmath71 ( given the inevitable uncertainty in @xmath67 due to sampling variability , the true optimal value should be close to this ) .",

    "this system has already been shown to display stochastic focusing , a sensitivity amplification phenomenon that arises due to nonlinearities and stochasticity whenever only a few enzyme molecules are present in the system .",
    "we have additionally shown that when the enzyme activity evolves on a slow timescale compared to that of the substrate , very large fluctuations can be generated in the system . moreover ,",
    "the dynamics of the system is extremely sensitive to variations in its reaction rates .",
    "both these observations imply that this simple model is not appropriate for robust signal detection .",
    "we asked how the system behavior would change in the presence of a feedback mechanism , so that the `` controller '' molecule ( @xmath2 ) could sense the fluctuations in @xmath0 ( its substrate ) or @xmath1 ( the product of the alternative reaction branch ) .",
    "we have shown that noise decreases dramatically in the presence of feedback , while the robustness of the average system behavior is boosted significantly .",
    "consequently , the focused system with feedback ends up behaving almost as predictably as a mean - field ode model , even when the number of active enzymes is very small .",
    "there exist several biochemical systems which in certain aspects match the main ideas behind the sfe motif , i.e.  display stochastic fluctuations in enzyme activity / abundance and substrate / product feedback activation .",
    "for example , it was recently discovered @xcite that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor sos and its substrate , the ras gtpase , are involved in a feedback loop where sos converts ras - gdp ( inactive ) to ras - gtp ( active ) and , in turn , active ras allosterically stabilizes the high - activity state of sos .",
    "another prominent example is microrna post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression @xcite , where a microrna may mediate the degradation of a target mrna , while the protein arising from this mrna in turn activates the microrna transcription .",
    "yet another instance is the heat shock response system in _",
    "@xcite : here the @xmath74 factor , which activates the heat - shock responsive genes , is quickly turned over under the action of the protease ftsh at normal growth temperatures . after a shift to high temperature ,",
    "@xmath74 is rapidly stabilized and at the same time it also activates the synthesis of ftsh .",
    "the ftsh - mediated degradation of @xmath74 is under negative feedback .",
    "finally , it is known that mrna decapping ( a process that triggers mrna degradation ) is controlled by the decapping enzyme dcp2 , which fluctuates between an open ( inactive ) and closed ( active ) form .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that the closed conformation of the enzyme is promoted by the activator protein dcp1 together with the mrna substrate itself @xcite .",
    "we should stress , however , that it is still unclear if any of the aforementioned examples display all the dynamic features of the motif considered in this work .",
    "speaking generally , due to the required levels of measurement accuracy , it is difficult to find examples that exactly match the conditions considered here with current experimental techniques .",
    "however , it is certainly conceivable that this will be achieved in the future .",
    "an interesting feature of our system is that homeostasis is achieved with a very small number of controller molecules ( in the order of 10 ) , which are able to maintain the output at a very low level with fluctuations that are  to a good approximation  poissonian .",
    "we have considered two alternative feedback schemes : in the first the substrate directly affects the activation rate of the enzyme ( a case of substrate activation ) , while in the second the product of the alternative reaction branch is used as a `` proxy '' for the substrate abundance .",
    "note that the flux through the @xmath0-@xmath1 branch is many orders of magnitude smaller than the flux in the @xmath3-regulated branch .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 branch can thus be thought to act as a `` sensor mechanism '' , used to control the high - flux branch of the system . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this type of feedback has not yet been observed in naturally occurring reactions .",
    "finally , it is worth to note that one could achieve this type of regulation with an `` unfocused '' system , in which the coupling between enzyme and substrate ( parameter @xmath27 ) would be much smaller .",
    "this would imply , however , that the number of enzyme molecules needed to achieve the same substrate levels would have to be much greater , and this could entail an added cost for a living cell .    in summary , to regulate a low - copy , high - flux substrate via an enzymatic mechanism such as the one considered here , there are three possibilities : a ) use of a low number of controller enzymes and strong coupling between enzyme and substrate ( which results in stochastic focusing and noise ) , b ) use of a high - copy enzyme and weak coupling ( with the associated production cost ) or c ) use of a low - copy controller with feedback : an alternative which , as we have demonstrated , leads to a remarkably well - behaved closed - loop system .",
    "it is thus conceivable that cellular feedback mechanisms have evolved to exploit the nature of stochastically focused systems to achieve regulation of low - copy substrates with the minimal number of controller molecules .",
    "we expect that the rapid development of experimental techniques in single - molecule enzymatics will soon enable the experimental verification of our findings and possibly the discovery of similar noise attenuation mechanisms inside cells .",
    "finally , our results can be seen as a first step towards the rational manipulation of noise properties in low - copy enzymatic reactions .",
    "this work was financially supported in part by the swiss national science foundation ( a.m .- a . and m.k . ) and the swedish research council within the upmarc linnaeus center of excellence ( s.e . and p.b . )",
    "the main point of our analysis here is to determine the _ sensitivity _ of a branched - reaction product to changes in the activation rate of an enzyme and in this way provide some justification for our modeling choices .",
    "the rationale behind this analysis is that one can not hope to control the mean - let alone the variance - of a product , if its statistics are not sensitive to changes in the enzyme . with this in mind , we examine the following branched reaction system :    @xmath75    the system consists of the following :    * an enzyme @xmath3 , that is found in low copy numbers and therefore its fluctuations have a significant impact on system behavior . * a high - copy , low - noise enzyme ( not shown ) , responsible for the conversion of @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , we can assume that @xmath0 `` matures '' into @xmath1 without the help of an enzyme .",
    "in both cases , this reaction can be considered to be first - order , even if it is enzymatic . * two products , @xmath1 and @xmath76 , which are produced from @xmath0 * the substrate species , @xmath0 , which plays the most critical role .",
    "@xmath0 enters the system through a zeroth - order reaction , and can have two alternate fates : it can either be converted to @xmath1 or @xmath76 .",
    "the initial sensitivity question can be now posed more precisely : which of the two reaction products , @xmath1 or @xmath76 , is more sensitive to changes in the activation rate of @xmath3 ?",
    "apart from the system structure , we are making the following assumptions regarding the reaction rates :    * the bimolecular reaction rate ( @xmath27 ) is large compared to the first - order reaction rate of @xmath0 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "that is , most of the influx of @xmath0 is directed towards @xmath76 .",
    "this assumption amplifies the effect of the nonlinear kinetics in the system ( in the opposite case , the bimolecular reaction could be considered as a perturbation in an almost - linear network ) . *",
    "the influx of @xmath0 to the system is high , i.e. @xmath8 is also large . *",
    "the rates of @xmath3 are such that @xmath3 has low copies and high noise ( this was already stated above ) , so that we can not replace @xmath3 by its mean in the bimolecular reaction .",
    "we now want to see what happens to the steady - state means @xmath78 and @xmath79 when @xmath25 varies . in the case of @xmath80 ,",
    "the situation is simple : @xmath78 follows the behavior of @xmath81 , @xmath82    thus , our focus shifts from @xmath1 to @xmath0 in this case . if the mean of @xmath0 is sensitive to changes in @xmath3 , we know that @xmath1 will be sensitive as well .",
    "this is precisely the case when stochastic focusing is present .    in the case of @xmath76 ,",
    "the situation is different : we expect it to be so , because in order to produce a @xmath76 molecule , we need both @xmath3 and @xmath0 to be present . therefore , if @xmath3 hits zero , @xmath0 will inevitably accumulate ( since we assumed that the rate of the alternate path , @xmath77 , is small ) , but no @xmath76 will be produced .",
    "instead , while @xmath3 stays at zero , @xmath76 will _ drop _ with a speed that depends on @xmath83 .",
    "once @xmath3 returns to non - zero numbers , the accumulated amount of @xmath0 will be converted into @xmath76 in a strong production burst .",
    "depending on @xmath83 , this may result in a brief burst of @xmath76 , or may go unnoticed ( when @xmath83 is small enough , the burst will happen , because @xmath76 can not be removed fast enough from the system ) .",
    "we thus see that @xmath76 can display a more complex behavior than @xmath1 .",
    "we next turn to the mean of @xmath76 . since @xmath84 ,",
    "let us assume first that @xmath85 . in this case , the first - moment equation for @xmath0 will give @xmath86    note that the mean of @xmath0 does not appear there , because we assumed no first - order degradation .",
    "the equation says that the steady - state mean of the product of @xmath3 with @xmath0 is constant , _ independently of _ @xmath25 . turning to the equation of the first moment of @xmath76",
    ", we then get @xmath87 which shows that @xmath76 is also not affected in its mean by changes in the rates of @xmath3 .",
    "intuitively , we can see why it is plausible for the mean of @xmath76 to remain constant , by looking at the bimolecular reaction that produces it : when @xmath25 increases , the mean of @xmath0 drops and vice versa .",
    "thus , the average production rate of @xmath76 can not change that much  and in fact , does not change at all in the limiting case @xmath88 .    using this observation",
    ", we can understand also why @xmath79 is not sensitive to @xmath25 when @xmath77 is non - zero but small : while in this case the above relations do not hold exactly , we still expect them to hold with good precision ( simulation verifies that ) . overall then , we see that @xmath76 is relatively insensitive to changes in @xmath25 , compared to @xmath1 , and it makes sense to consider @xmath76 as the target for regulation .    it should be noted that the above arguments hold only for the _ means _ of @xmath1 and @xmath76 . we do not expect the variance of @xmath76 to be equally insensitive to the noise in @xmath3",
    ", however it is not entirely clear how @xmath76 could be used in a noise - suppressing feedback mechanism .        to get a feeling for the scaling of the different constants we consider the equilibrium solutions to the ode model of the network .",
    "the following three relations are immediate : @xmath89    assuming the mean lifetime of the substrate and the enzyme to be about the same we may pick the units of time such that @xmath90 . as we are interested in stochastic",
    "focusing , a low copy - number phenomenon , we further prescribe as a _ base case _ that @xmath91 . combined with and this implies @xmath92 with the enzymatic rate parameter @xmath27 still free and  given , we can next consider the rate for the inflow of enzyme @xmath93 to be an adjustable parameter which controls the amount of product @xmath76 .    using  and  we arrive at the relation @xmath94 for any given rate @xmath27 and desirable setpoint @xmath95 , can be solved for the value of @xmath93 that makes @xmath96 .",
    "we now define the _ gain _ @xmath97 as the response to a 50% decrease of enzyme from the base case @xmath98 , @xmath99 with @xmath100 , @xmath76 does not respond ( i.e.  is insensitive ) , and @xmath101 can be considered a perfect transmission .    in the table below values from using have been computed for different values of the rate constant @xmath27 .",

    "we here consider a more realistic enzymatic reaction mechanism for the degradation of the substrate @xmath0 , which includes the formation of an enzyme - substrate complex .",
    "as we will see , this more detailed mechanism implies an overall behavior which is similar to the sfe model studied in the main paper    the mechanism is displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : enzyme_saturation_mech ] . according to this scheme , active enzyme ( @xmath103 ) and substrate",
    "have to first form a complex before @xmath0 is degraded .",
    "if the enzyme spontaneously switches to its inactive form while bound to @xmath0 , we assume that the complex dissociates .        with the additional reactions ,",
    "the open - loop system becomes again analytically intractable , as the conditional moment equations are no longer closed .",
    "we will therefore base our analysis on the behavior of the corresponding deterministic system . to further simplify the task",
    ", we will first assume a fixed number of active enzymes , @xmath104 , i.e. ignore the enzyme ( de)activation reactions .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the substrate flux towards @xmath1 is much smaller than the flux into the enzymatic reaction and therefore set @xmath105 .",
    "under these conditions , one can verify that the steady - state concentration of substrate and free ( active ) enzyme are given by the following expressions :    @xmath106    we see that the existence of a finite positive steady - state for the system depends on the relation of @xmath107 with the ratio @xmath108 , which connects the rates of substrate influx and the catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme .",
    "in other words , if there is not a sufficient number of active enzymes in the system , there is no finite and positive steady - state ; instead , the number of substrate molecules tends to infinity , as the existing free enzyme molecules are completely saturated and can not process all incoming substrate molecules .",
    "when an alternative fate is available for the substrate ( e.g. its conversion to @xmath1 ) , the system will of course be stable , as the alternative pathway will absorb the excess substrate .",
    "however , if @xmath77 is small compared to @xmath109 , the resulting steady - state substrate concentration , expected to be close to @xmath110 , will be large .    now , let us consider the case where @xmath107 is varied externally .",
    "as it approaches @xmath108 from above , the steady - state concentration of @xmath0 quickly diverges to infinity .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to imagine that if active enzymes fluctuate slowly , randomly and close to the critical value @xmath108 , this will result in dramatic fluctuations in @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : c_saturation ] , the cv of @xmath0 was reduced from about 2 to about 0.38 and the fano factor from about 900 to about 1.73 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",

    "<S> moreover , we observe that the discrepancy between deterministic and stochastic descriptions of stochastically focused systems in the evolution of the means almost completely disappears , despite very low molecule counts and the additional nonlinearity due to feedback .    </S>",
    "<S> the reaction mechanism considered here can provide a possible resolution to the apparent conflict between intrinsic noise and high precision in critical intracellular processes . </S>"
