    "it has been realized for some time that particle physics experiments using cosmic beams may be sensitive to planck scale physics@xcite .",
    "neutrino telescopes in particular have unmatched sensitivity to violations of lorenz invariance ( livs ) and the equivalence principle by exploiting the high statistics observations of the guaranteed high energy atmospheric neutrino beam in conjunctions with methods demonstrated by the superkamiokande and macro collaborations@xcite .",
    "livs are the sources of observable flavor oscillations caused by the different speed of light of the three neutrino flavors .",
    "while the atmospheric neutrino data will reach pev energy , the observation of cosmic beams may extend the neutrino sample to eev energy .",
    "of particular interest in this context is the observation of high energy neutrinos from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) whose short - time burst nature make more direct tests of lorenz invariance possible .",
    "their energy is such that the measurements may be sensitive to modifications of lorenz symmetry associated with planck scale physics@xcite .",
    "lorenz invariance can be tested by measuring the travel times of particles over cosmic distances .",
    "the method is familiar from pulsar observation@xcite .",
    "the pulsar provides a clock at the time of emission .",
    "it has recently been suggested that more sensitive observations can be made by measuring the relative time of photon and very high energy neutrino emission by grbs  @xcite .",
    "the photon emission in a burst lasting seconds starts the clock for a neutrino whose early or delayed arrival time @xmath0 will be a signature of liv .",
    "note that at the energies relevant to this problem neutrinos are , like photons , massless particles .",
    "the measurement conceptually tests , in an essentially model - independent way , liv associated with the possible breakdown of lorenz symmetry at the planck scale . in some theories unifying quantum mechanics and gravity the continuous spacetime of general relativity becomes quantized in volumes that can not be further subdivided",
    ". particles with very high energy and small wavelength may sense this spacetime foam and be delayed , just like photons traveling through a crystal .",
    "the phenomenology can be discussed as a generic modification of the dispersion relation @xmath1 for particles with energy @xmath2 .",
    "the time delay of a particle with energy @xmath3 emitted at redshift @xmath4 ( distance @xmath5 ) is @xmath6 a sensitive test requires good timing @xmath0 , high energy @xmath3 and large distances @xmath5 .",
    "back - of - the - envelope is sufficient to conclude that grbs provide the opportunity to reach the planck scale , i.e @xmath7 , at least for n=1 , although there is little sensitivity for higher values of n. it is also misleading .    as will become clear as the arguments in this paper develop , it will be challenging to ever argue that the delay of a high energy neutrino relative to the light of a grb requires liv rather than a straightforward astrophysics explanation associated with the poorly understood nature of the source .",
    "we will argue indeed that the fireball phenomenology of grbs can accommodate the emission of high energy neutrinos over timescales from seconds to days and beyond .",
    "emission over such timescales is actually expected , as we will argue further on .",
    "in particular , we will give an example in the next section how delays of very high energy neutrinos by more than 1,000 seconds from the start of the photon display , can be accommodated by fireball phenomenology rather than by liv .",
    "this renders the implementation of the proposal in reference@xcite more challenging .",
    "we here also revisit an alternative proposal to exploit the emission of two neutrinos from a single grb@xcite . even though the neutrino rate from grbs is expected to be order 10 per kilometer squared per year@xcite , events with two neutrinos are not rare@xcite .",
    "this is because neutrinos are mostly produced by relatively nearby and relatively energetic bursts .",
    "as an example we refer to the calculation of reference@xcite .",
    "the large burst - to - burst fluctuations can be seen from their figure 2 .",
    "although their conservative estimates predict less than 10 events per year , applying poisson statistics we anticipate that bursts with 2 neutrinos should be observed within 2 year intervals .    we will emphasize how grb fireball phenomenology anticipates a very attractive timing of the neutrino emission , with tev neutrinos produced before , pev neutrinos in coincidence with , and eev neutrinos after the photon display .",
    "i.e. higher energy particles come later and a reversal of this order can provide us with evidence for liv .",
    "we finally confront the additional problem that kilometer - scale neutrino telescopes do not measure neutrino energy directly . for the dominant @xmath8 signal the detector only measures the energy - loss of the secondary muon when it passes through the detector@xcite .",
    "we will derive the probability distribution of neutrino energies that accommodates the observed energy in the detector .",
    "our results on energy measurement presented should be of interest beyond their application to the problem considered here .",
    "the problem is less severe for electron and tau neutrinos where the detectors are total absorption calorimeters for the secondary showers produced by the neutrino interactions@xcite .    in the end",
    "we conclude that revealing planck - scale physics with icecube may be possible , but will be challenging . reading",
    "the time of the astrophysical grb clock is not straightforward and the energy of the neutrinos is not directly measured .",
    "we point out scenarios where the first problem can be overcome , in the meantime we will just have to wait for observations that will clearly define the dilemma , if any .",
    "the second problem is interesting and impacts all observations with high energy neutrino telescopes . a straightforward solution is to do the science with electron and tau neutrinos only .",
    "the energy of their secondary showers can be measured with a linear energy resolution of 20% .",
    "though grbs represent a background - free signal in neutrino telescopes because of the clustering in time and in direction , the event rates are still uncertain . they will exceed 10 events per kilometer square year , in the case where the baryon loading in grb fireballs accommodates the observed cosmic rays . with the low event rates anticipated doing the planck science with showers",
    "may not be a practical solution and we may be forced to explore the long range of the secondary muons in order to collect the enhanced rates expected for muon neutrinos .",
    "their better pointing will also facilitate background rejection .",
    "how well one reconstructs muon energy of individual events has to the best of our knowledge not been systematically analyzed .",
    "our results should be of interest beyond their application to the problem considered here .",
    "we here review how grbs produce a sequence of tev , pev and eev neutrinos separated in time .",
    "they provide a clock with later time implying higher energy .",
    "we propose to exploit this feature for measuring particle delays signaling liv .",
    "gamma ray bursts are perhaps the best motivated sources of high - energy neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the collapse of massive stars to a black hole has emerged as the likely origin of the  long \" grbs with durations of 10 seconds on average .",
    "the grb rate is consistent with the rate of supernovae with progenitor masses exceeding several solar masses . in the collapse of the massive star",
    "a fireball is produced which expands with a highly relativistic velocity powered by radiation pressure .",
    "the fireball eventually runs into the stellar material that is still accreting onto the black hole .",
    "if it successfully punctures through this stellar envelope the fireball emerges to produce the grb display .",
    "while the energy transferred to highly relativistic electrons is thus observed in the form of radiation , it is a matter of speculation how much energy is transferred to protons .",
    "the phenomenology that successfully describes grb observations is that of a fireball expanding with highly relativistic velocity , powered by radiation pressure .",
    "the observer detects boosted energies emitted over contracted times ; without this a description of the extreme observations is impossible .",
    "the millisecond variations of the grb flux require an original event where a large amount of energy is released in a very compact volume of order @xmath9 km .",
    "the dynamics of the fireball is actually reminiscent of the physics of the early expanding universe .",
    "initially , there is a radiation dominated soup of leptons and photons and few baryons .",
    "it is hot enough to freely produce electron - positron pairs . with an optical depth of order @xmath10 ,",
    "photons are trapped in the fireball .",
    "it can not radiate .",
    "this causes the highly relativistic expansion of the fireball powered by radiation pressure . the fireball will expand with increasing velocity until it becomes transparent and the radiation is released in the display of the grb . by this time",
    ", the expansion velocity has reached highly relativistic values of order @xmath11 .    with a relativistic expansion of @xmath11 it may be possible that protons are accelerated to energies above @xmath12ev in the fireball that accommodates the grb observations@xcite .",
    "grbs within a radius of 50 - 100 mpc over which protons can propagate in the microwave background , may therefore be the sources of the ultra high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "the assumption that grbs are the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays does determine the energy of the fireball baryons . accommodating the observed cosmic ray spectrum of extragalactic cosmic rays requires roughly equal efficiency for conversion of fireball energy into the kinetic energy of protons and electrons . in this scenario",
    "the production of neutrinos of 1001000tev energy in the grb fireball is a robust prediction because pions , and therefore neutrinos , are inevitably produced in interactions of accelerated protons with fireball photons@xcite .",
    "there are several other opportunities for neutrino production following the chain of events in the production of a grb .    * tev neutrino production in the stellar envelope @xmath1310 seconds before the grb display",
    ". + the core collapse of massive stars has emerged as the likely origin of the  long \" grb with durations of tens of seconds .",
    "the fireball produced is likely to be beamed in jets along the rotation axis of the collapsed object .",
    "the mechanism is familiar from observations of jets associated with the central black hole in active galaxies .",
    "the jets eventually run into the stellar material that is still accreting onto the black hole .",
    "if the jets successfully puncture through this stellar envelope they will emerge to produce a grb .",
    "while the fireball penetrates the remnant of the star , the fast particles in the tail will catch up with the slow particles in the leading edge and collide providing another opportunity for pion production yielding neutrinos of tens of tev energy .",
    "bursts within a few hundred megaparsecs ( @xmath14 bursts per year as well as an additional unknown number of `` invisible '' bursts from failed grbs ) may actually produce large rates of tev neutrino events in a kilometer - scale detector and , possibly , observable rates in a first - generation detector such as amanda@xcite .",
    "interestingly , failed jets that do not emerge will not produce a visible grb but do produce observable neutrinos@xcite . * pev neutrino production inside the expanding fireball for a duration of  10 seconds coincident with the grb .",
    "+ the production of pev neutrinos in cosmic ray producing grb fireballs is a robust prediction@xcite .",
    "neutrinos are inevitably produced in interactions of accelerated protons with fireball photons . as the kinetic energy in fireball protons increases with expansion , a fraction of their energy is converted into pions once the protons are accelerated above threshold for pion production . * eev production in the interstellar medium over minutes  days after the grb display .",
    "+ afterglow observations show that external shocks are produced when the grb runs into the interstellar medium . the hadronic component in the fireball",
    "can be rapidly depleted by means of photopion process on time scales of @xmath15seconds .",
    "it has been argued that this  aftershock \" explains the accumulating evidence from recent swift observations for a second high energy component in the grb as well as for the sharp decline of the x - ray light curves that take place over similar timescales@xcite .",
    "this is the phase in which the highest energies are reached , 100eev for cosmic rays and 1eev for the secondary neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino rates are predicted to be low in icecube but represent an opportunity for radio or acoustic detectors such as rice with high threshold , but also larger effective area@xcite .",
    "+ it is this last phase of neutrino production that will interfere with the proposal of jacob and piran@xcite . optimistically assuming that one will make multiple observations and that , contrary to evidence , grbs are somehow standard candles , one could still try to distinguish liv from astrophysics induced delays by establishing the linear dependence of the time delay on the distance ; see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delt ] ) .",
    "while the arrival time of neutrinos is measured with microsecond accuracy , determination of the energy is a considerable challenge .",
    "both are required to test liv .",
    "in neutrino telescopes , neutrinos are detected through the observation of erenkov light emitted by charged particles produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "the neutrino induced events can be categorized as either muon tracks or showers .",
    "cosmic ray muons and muons from charged current ( cc ) @xmath8 interactions are the origin of tracks .",
    "showers results from neutrino interactions  @xmath17 cc interactions , and neutral current ( nc ) interactions initiated by all three flavors  inside or near the detector .",
    "because of the large range of muons , kilometers to tens of kilometers for the energies considered here , the effective volume of the detector for muon neutrinos is significantly larger than the instrumented volume .",
    "furthermore , the angular resolution for muon tracks is superior to that for showers .",
    "for example , for icecube the angular resolution for muon tracks @xmath18  @xcite which allows a search window of solid angle @xmath19  sd , while for showers the angular resolution is significantly worse .",
    "while the large effective volume and the better background rejection of atmospheric backgrounds because of the superior angular resolution favors the observation of muon neutrinos , measurement of their energy is indirect .",
    "neutrino telescopes only measure the energy @xmath20 deposited by the muon when traversing the detector which is only indirectly related to the original neutrino energy .",
    "particle physics determines the probability @xmath21 distribution for the parent neutrino energy of a muon track that deposits an energy @xmath22 inside the detector : @xmath23 @xmath24 is the incident neutrino spectrum , @xmath25 is the differential neutrino cc interaction cross section and @xmath26 represents the probability that a muon produced with energy @xmath27 arrives at the detector with energy @xmath28 after traveling a distance @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath29 is obtained by propagating the muons through the ice taking into account energy losses from ionization , bremsstrahlung , @xmath30 pair production and nuclear interactions  @xcite .",
    "the details of the detector are encoded in the effective area @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the minimum muon track length required for the event to be detected .",
    "@xmath33 is the normalization factor obtained from @xmath34 .",
    "we show in fig.[fig : penem ] the probability distribution function @xmath21 ( for convenience we plot it as @xmath35 ) as a function of the neutrino energy for different values of @xmath22 and for two different neutrino spectra , a broken spectrum @xmath36 and a continuous spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "we used the parametrization for @xmath31 given in ref.@xcite which describes the response of the icecube detector after all backgrounds have been rejected ( this is achieved by quality cuts referred to as  level 2 \" cuts in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and we fix @xmath38 m.     probability distribution for the parent neutrino energy of a muon track event which deposits an energy @xmath22 at the detector for different values of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 gev as labeled in the figure . the left panel was obtained for a broken neutrino spectrum ( eq.([eq : broken ] ) ) with @xmath41 gev while the right panel corresponds to a continuous @xmath42 spectrum . ]",
    "the figure illustrates the challenge in experimentally determining the presence of an effect which depends on the original neutrino energy based on the observation of a muon track event . we can furthermore infer the even bigger challenge for the case of establishing ( or constraining ) the violation of lorentz invariance from the observation of the arrival times of two muon events with different energy from a single grb , a case we discuss next .",
    "in principle one could test the hypothesis of liv from the observed arrival times , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , of two neutrino events from a single grb by confronting @xmath45 with @xmath46 given in eq.([eq : delt ] ) . here",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the time difference of production of the two neutrinos _ at the source _ and not at arrival .",
    "it is not directly observed .",
    "assuming we can infer @xmath47 , then for @xmath48 @xmath49 where we have defined @xmath50 numerically for @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "however , as illustrated in fig.[fig : penem ] , inferring @xmath56 from the measured values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 of two muon tracks is highly non - trivial .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 one can determine the relevant probability distribution of the parent neutrino energy difference @xmath59 as : @xmath60 ( equivalently one can build the corresponding probability distribution for any combination @xmath61 . )     probability distribution for the parent neutrino energy difference of two muon track events which deposit an energy @xmath62 and @xmath58 inside the detector for different values of @xmath63 and @xmath63 as labeled in the figure .",
    "this distribution is for a @xmath64 neutrino spectrum . in all cases",
    "but we are showing @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 hence the apparent difference in normalization of the curves . ]",
    "we show in fig.[fig : fdelta ] the value of @xmath68 for @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 gev and @xmath70 gev and @xmath72 gev . from the figure we see that ,",
    "because of the relatively broad spectrum of the parent neutrino energy distributions , one can not rule out relatively large parent neutrino energy differences even if the two observed muon track events deposit the same energy at the detector .",
    "conversely , only for very different deposited energies one can establish that the parent neutrino energies were different with high cl .",
    "more quantitatively for a given pair of observed events with @xmath62 and @xmath58 from a single grb we can determine : @xmath73 from eqs.([eq : xi ] ) and ( [ eq : probdel ] ) one can compute the probability for @xmath74 which corresponds to the observation of a pair of events from a single grb with @xmath57 and @xmath58 and arrival times @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    as illustration",
    "we show in figs.[fig : con46 ] and [ fig : con48 ] the ranges of @xmath75 which can be inferred from the observation of two muon track events with @xmath70 gev and @xmath76 gev and with @xmath70 gev and @xmath77 gev respectively , as a function of the ratio of the arrival time difference and the time difference at production .",
    "allowed ranges of the liv scale factor @xmath75 with probability bigger than @xmath78 and @xmath79 from the observation of two track events from a single grb with @xmath80 and @xmath71 gev as a function of the ratio of between the observed time difference and the time difference at production in the grb .",
    "this is shown for an assumed continuous @xmath64 neutrino spectrum.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]        * what one observes is in all cases compatible with no liv if the model predicts @xmath81 , hence the asymptotic peaks which reach @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the upper and lower right panels at @xmath81 .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : con46 ] , if the deposit energy of the two events are not different enough , the allowed range of @xmath75 include very low values .",
    "thus no meaningful bound on the scale of liv can be set .",
    "* when the deposited energies of the two events are very different and one assumes that @xmath84 , one can set a lower bound on the scale of liv .",
    "for example for @xmath80 gev and @xmath72 gev we find at 99.9% probability that @xmath85 * in the absence of an argument for @xmath86 , the conclusion is that one has to be observing liv .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : con46 ] , if the two events deposit energies which are not different enough the observation is compatible with a very wide range of scales of liv and with both signs of the effect .",
    "* when the deposited energies of the two events are very different the determination of @xmath75 becomes better as implied by the narrow width of the allowed regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : con48 ] . also one sign is favored : it is more likely that @xmath75 has the opposite ( same ) sign than @xmath47 if the @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "finally , the estimates assume negligible background from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "one expects of the order of 200 muon track events a year with @xmath89 gev arriving from any direction with zenith angle @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this means that , on average , the expected number of atmospheric background events in an angular bin of @xmath19  sr and in a time interval of @xmath91 is @xmath92\\simeq \\ , 2 \\times 10^{-8}\\;\\ ; \\frac{\\delta t_{obs}}{min}\\ ] ] so as long as the observed time window is at most of the order of months the atmospheric background can be safely neglected even if one of the events has deposited energy as low as @xmath93 gev .",
    "observing the less frequent @xmath94 and @xmath95 events could present us with a solution to the energy measurement problem . because of oscillations over cosmic distances the grb flux will be equally distributed over the three neutrino flavors .",
    "neutrino telescopes detect the cherenkov light radiated by secondary particle showers produced by neutrinos of all flavors . these include the electromagnetic and hadronic showers initiated by @xmath94 and @xmath95 as well as by neutral current interactions of neutrinos of all flavors . because the size of these showers , of order 10 m in ice , is small compared to the spacing of the pmts , they represent , to a good approximation , a point source of cherenkov photons radiated by the shower particles . these trigger the pmts at the single photoelectron level over essentially spherical volume , slightly elongated in the direction of the initial neutrino , whose radius scales linearly with the shower energy@xcite .",
    "whereas the smaller first - generation telescopes mostly exploit the large range of the muon to increase their effective area for @xmath8 , kilometer - scale detectors can fully exploit the advantages associated with the detection of showers initiated by @xmath94 and @xmath96 :    1 .",
    "they are detected over both northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "the background of atmospheric neutrinos is significantly reduced . at higher energies the muons from @xmath97 decay , the source of atmospheric @xmath98 , no longer decay and relatively rare k - decays become the dominant source of background electron neutrinos .",
    "3 .   @xmath96 are not absorbed , but degraded by energy in the earth .",
    "critical in this context is that , depending on energy , electron and tau neutrinos deposit 0.5 - 0.8% of their energy into an electromagnetic shower initiated by the leading final state lepton .",
    "the rest of the energy goes into the fragments of the target that produce a second subdominant shower . for ice ,",
    "the cherenkov light generated by shower particles spreads over a volume of radius 130 m at 10tev and 460 m at 10eev , i.e. the shower radius grows by just over 50 m per decade in energy .",
    "the measurement of the radius of the lightpool mapped by the lattice of pmts determines the energy and turns neutrino telescopes into total absorption calorimeters .",
    "note that even a contained  direct hit \" by a 10 eev neutrino will not saturate a km@xmath99 detector volume .",
    "so , even for eev neutrinos , icecube will not saturate and their energy spectrum can be measured .",
    "the drawback of the use of shower events are the lower statistics and the worse angular resolution .",
    "although , in principle , grbs represent a background - free signal in neutrino telescopes because of the clustering in time and in direction , the event rates are still uncertain . they will exceed 10 events per kilometer square year , in the case where the baryon loading in grb fireballs accommodates the observed cosmic rays . with the low event rates anticipated doing the planck science with showers",
    "may not be a practical solution .",
    "furthermore their worse pointing will also difficulty background rejection .    in the end",
    "we will have to await the actual observations to draw any conclusions regarding the reality of observing planck physics with neutrino telescopes .",
    "we have argued that the existing back - of - the - envelope estimates are unlikely to be realized and have described the realistic background on which the possibility of observing planck physics will have to be pursued .",
    "the problem is undoubtedly important given the absence of clear alternatives .",
