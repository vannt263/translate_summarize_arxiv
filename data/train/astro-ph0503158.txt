    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are simple stellar populations ( single age , single metallicity ) that help to trace the formation history of their host galaxy .",
    "gcs are also powerful tools in revealing the halo kinematics and dynamics , if large samples of globular cluster radial velocities can be obtained .",
    "ngc 5128 , the central galaxy in the centaurus cluster 3.9 mpc away , and the nearest readily accessible giant e galaxy , provides a unique and exciting possibility to study the dynamics and formation history through its globular cluster system ( gcs ) .",
    "however , finding its clusters individually is a difficult job : at its moderately low galactic latitude of @xmath3 , field contamination by both foreground stars and background galaxies is significant , and the gcs can not be distinguished by only image morphology , object size , or color .",
    "thus except for the very expensive and time - consuming approach of resolving the gcs into individual stars by ( say ) hst imaging , radial velocity determinations provide the only definitive method for classifying a candidate object in the ngc 5128 field as a genuine gc .",
    "ngc 5128 has a statistically determined total population of @xmath4 globular clusters , giving it a low specific frequency @xmath5 ( harris , harris , & geisler 2004 , hereafter hhg04 ) .",
    "an @xmath6 value this low ( in the range occupied by large spiral galaxies ) is suggestive of a merger origin @xcite ; other indicators of mergers are the faint isophotal shells in the halo of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the activity in the inner 5 kpc region indicated by the visible dust lane , the recent star formation , and the presence of gas .",
    "the gcs , with its wide mixture of cluster metallicities and perhaps ages , should provide many additional clues to the formation history surrounding this giant elliptical . an excellent starting point for",
    "any such discussion is to have as large as possible a list of individual , certainly identified gcs through radial velocity measurements .",
    "previous work has led to a list of 215 confirmed gcs in ngc 5128 with radial velocity measurements ( peng , ford , & freeman 2004 , hereafter pff04 ) .",
    "many hundreds more clusters remain to be found . in this paper ,",
    "the first of a new series of studies of the gcs in this unique galaxy , we present new velocity measurements and the discovery of 31 new gcs .",
    "the wide - field photometry study of the ngc 5128 field in the washington @xmath7 system by @xcite provides a list of 327 gc candidates having globular - cluster - like colors and slightly nonstellar morphology .",
    "this list provides the basis for our new radial velocity survey .",
    "observations were taken at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4 m telescope in april 2004 . the hydra multi - object fibre - fed spectrograph , with @xmath8 diameter field of view ,",
    "was used with the kpgl1 grating and @xmath9 binning in dispersion , giving a spectral resolution element of approximately 3.5 binned pixels ( fwhm ) .",
    "the spectral coverage was @xmath10  @xmath11  @xmath12 , extending from ca ii h+k at the blue end to the mgb features at the red end at 1.18  / px . of our three assigned nights ,",
    "two were lost to clouds , and the third had poor seeing throughout ( @xmath13 ) . nevertheless , we successfully observed two hydra field configurations , both centered on the galaxy .",
    "total exposure times were @xmath14 sec for the first field and @xmath15 sec for the second .",
    "the data reduction was performed through the _ dohydra _ package within iraf , following the normal sequence of preprocessing described on the hydra webpages .",
    "the raw images were overscan and bias subtracted , and the detector was flat - fielded with milk flats ( daytime sky exposures ) using a diffusing filter in front of the hydra fibres .",
    "cosmic rays were subtracted with a laplacian edge detection method @xcite .",
    "spectral throughput and dispersion corrections were applied based on the standard continuum lamp and hydra henear penray lamp to obtain wavelength calibrated spectra .",
    "removal of background light from each object spectrum includes both the uniform dark - sky illumination and ( for the gc candidates close to the galaxy center ) the bulge light from ngc 5128 itself . to trace both effects",
    ", we placed 40 - 50 fibers in each hydra field configuration on blank - sky positions sprinkled across the entire field , then plotted the mean intensity of each sky fiber versus radius from galaxy center .",
    "the data showed that the bulge light profile was well matched by a @xmath16 radial dependence ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for radii larger than @xmath17 , the galaxy bulge light contamination was negligible and we simply subtracted the average of the sky spectra at these larger radii from all the object spectra . for the inner objects , we then removed the additional bulge light contamination through appropriate radial scaling of the average bulge sky spectrum .      from the fully preprocessed and background - subtracted spectra , we derived radial velocities obtained through fourier cross - correlation , using the _ fxcor _ task in the _ radial velocity _ iraf package .",
    "the spectrum of each candidate object was correlated against a template spectrum of known velocity and the correlation peak was fit with a lorentzian function .",
    "our template spectrum was constructed from the sum of five of the previously known bright gcs in ngc 5128 ( c7 , c11 , c17 , c19 , and c20 ) , which we observed in both of our hydra fields and which have well determined velocities taken from pff04 .",
    "thus , the template was very well tuned to the the spectral features in the gcs that we are searching for since it was built from exactly the same type of object .",
    "ngc 5128 has a systemic velocity of 541 km s@xmath18 @xcite and an internal stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath19 km s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these features allow a clean velocity separation between gcs and foreground stars in the milky way or background galaxies .",
    "as shown ( e.g. ) by pff04 , the foreground stars have velocities almost all less than @xmath20 km s@xmath18 , while any faint background galaxies will have velocities of many thousands of km s@xmath18 . any objects that fall in the range @xmath21 km s@xmath18 ( and drawn from the candidate list pre - selected by image morphology , magnitude and color ) will therefore be near - certain gcs .    from both hydra fields combined , we obtained radial velocity measurements for 86 candidate gcs and 43 previously known gcs .",
    "the previously known clusters were used to help establish the zero point of our velocity scale and check the internal measurement uncertainties ( see below ) . of the candidates , we found 31 with @xmath22 km s@xmath18 , which we identify as newly discovered gcs .",
    "of these 31 , 5 are x - ray sources previously detected by @xcite . in table",
    "[ newgc ] , we list the data for these gcs .",
    "successive columns give the identification number ( whh prefixes denote our new objects ) , coordinates , radial distance from the center of ngc 5128 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 photometry from hhg04 , radial velocity , and velocity uncertainty from the _ fxcor _ solution .    of the 55 remaining candidates , 24 are definite foreground stars with @xmath24 kms@xmath18 , and 31 are likely background galaxies ;",
    "these are listed in table  [ fsbg ] .",
    "the objects with null results for the radial velocity are ones whose spectra had a poor correlation with the gc template spectrum , suggestive of a background galaxy with either very large redshift or spectral features very different from the template . confirming 31 candidates as gcs out of the 86 candidates observed yields an encouraging 36% hit rate given the extremely high field contamination level , and demonstrates the value of rigorous preselection by color and object morphology ( see the discussion of hhg04 ) .",
    "table  [ knowngc ] lists the resulting radial velocity measurements of the 43 previously known gcs remeasured in this study .",
    "the identification number prefixes c , g , or pff_gc are originally listed by @xcite and pff04 .",
    "figure [ positions ] shows the locations of the newly confirmed and previously known gcs .",
    "whereas most previous surveys have concentrated on fields along the isophotal major axis of ngc 5128 ( along a line running sw to ne ) , it is worth noting that many of our newly identified gcs lie along the less well studied minor axis parallel to the inner dust lane .",
    "there are likely to be many more to be found still .",
    "figure [ fsgc ] shows the velocity distribution of the gcs and foreground stars measured from this study ; the two types of objects are clearly distinguished by radial velocity at @xmath25 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the analysis of the gcs radial profile by hhg04 showed that the majority of gcs lie within @xmath26 from the galaxy center , with the main contribution of the clusters residing in an even more compact environment within @xmath27 .",
    "our new sample of 31 gcs has a median value of @xmath28 .",
    "the mean radial velocity difference between the previously known clusters in our study and those of pff04 is less than 10 km s@xmath18 , well within the standard deviation of the mean ( see below ) .",
    "the zero point of our velocity scale therefore needs no adjustment .",
    "the raw spectra of clusters whh-12 , whh-25 , whh-31 , pff_gc-073 , and the non - gc candidates 100 , 133 , and 136 had a few intensity spikes that could not be removed in the preprocessing stage .",
    "these regions were artificially removed before the cross - correlation solutions , resulting in higher than normal velocity uncertainties ( see tables  [ newgc ] &  [ fsbg ] ) .    for the previously known cluster c10",
    ", we measure @xmath29 km s@xmath18 .",
    "this differs quite a bit from the pff04 measurement of @xmath30 km s@xmath18 , but it agrees well with @xcite ( @xmath31 km s@xmath18 ) and also with the new measurement from @xcite ( 836 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "we therefore believe our measurement to be in the correct range .",
    "there is one candidate for which the velocity solution revealed a second correlation peak only slightly smaller than the highest peak that is automatically found and fit by the _",
    "fxcor _ task . for whh-22 ,",
    "the highest correlation peak yields @xmath32 km s@xmath18 , clearly classifying this object as a gc ; but a second peak yields @xmath33 km s@xmath18 , which would classify it as a foreground star .",
    "visual inspection of the candidate spectrum shows hydrogen and calcium line strengths consistent with those for clusters .",
    "we keep this object as a probably gc , but with these uncertainties in mind .",
    "a strong secondary peak was also revealed for the known cluster , pff_gc-060 .",
    "the highest peak gives @xmath34 km s@xmath18 , but a second peak gives 217 km s@xmath18 , which would put it on the borderline between gcs and foreground stars .",
    "its spectrum does not have high enough signal - to - noise to determine upon visual inspection whether or not it is a cluster .",
    "however , this object has been measured by pff04 to have @xmath35 km s@xmath18 , agreeing with our highest peak correlation value .    for three previously known gcs , c21 , pff_gc-089 , and pff_gc-064 , the highest correlation peak fit generated by _ fxcor _ yielded radial velocities that were inconsistent with previous measurements",
    ". a closer look at the correlated spectra shows a second strong correlation peak in all cases . choosing the secondary peak gave @xmath36 km s@xmath18 for c21 ( compared with @xmath37 km s@xmath18 from pff04 ) and @xmath38 km s@xmath18 for pff_gc-089 ( compared with @xmath39 km s@xmath18 from pff04 ) .",
    "c21 has also been previously measured by @xcite to be at @xmath40 km s@xmath18 .",
    "for these two objects we therefore adopted the second correlation peaks . the known cluster , pff_gc-064 , measured in both field configurations , presents a slightly different problem : the initial poorly correlated fit in field 1 nominally classified it as a possible background galaxy .",
    "yet , there is a second strong correlation peak with @xmath41 km s@xmath18 , agreeing with the field 2 result for the same object of @xmath42 km s@xmath18 and also with the pff04 measurement of @xmath43 km s@xmath18 .",
    "there are three other candidates measured in both field configurations , 43/44 , 109/110 , and 101 .",
    "their radial velocities classified these objects as possible background galaxies , with their averaged radial velocities as displayed in tables  [ fsbg ]",
    ". objects 43 and 44 in the candidate list of hhg04 turn out to be the same object , and similarly candidates 109 and 110 are the same .",
    "lastly , we note that 12 of the hhg04 candidate objects measured in this study turned out to be previously known gcs . these objects are listed in table  [ overlaps ] .",
    "the radial velocity uncertainties we quote in the tables are from the _ fxcor _ solutions .",
    "generally , these are well correlated with the object s apparent magnitude and thus the signal - to - noise of the spectra .",
    "figure  [ resultserrmag3 ] shows the nominal radial velocity uncertainties plotted versus v magnitude .",
    "the new gcs ( excluding whh-12 , whh-25 , and whh-31 ; see above ) with @xmath44 had a mean @xmath45 km s@xmath18 and s / n @xmath46 per pixel in the continuum region near @xmath47 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the mean uncertainty was @xmath49 km s@xmath18 and s / n @xmath50 per pixel .",
    "we tested the _",
    "fxcor _ uncertainties in several ways .",
    "first , the comparison between our velocities and those of pff04 for 42 clusters in common ( excluding c10 as mentioned above ) is shown in figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "the standard deviation of the differences between the two studies was @xmath5144.5 km s@xmath18 .",
    "if the two studies have comparable internal uncertainties , then this suggests that for gcs brighter than @xmath52 the typical uncertainty of our measurements is no larger than @xmath53 km s@xmath18 , in agreement with the _ mknoise _ simulations in fig .",
    "[ resultserrmag3 ] ( see below ) .",
    "another internal test was to compare the velocities for objects that we measured in both hydra field settings .",
    "there were 13 such gcs measured twice , 12 of them brighter than @xmath54 : c2 , c6 , c13 , c14 , c18 , c19 , c20 , c26 , c37 , c38 , c44 , pff_gc-056 , and pff_gc-064 ( @xmath55 mag ) .",
    "for these , the mean velocity difference between the two fields was 3.9 km s@xmath18 , with a standard deviation of @xmath5122.3 km s@xmath18 , again consistent with fig .",
    "[ resultserrmag3 ] .    finally , we compared the _ fxcor _ uncertainties with those generated from simulated noisy spectra , adding gaussian noise to the template spectrum with the iraf _",
    "artdata.mknoise _ task .",
    "several dozen of these artificial spectra were cross - correlated against the original template spectrum and the resulting radial velocity uncertainties plotted against the s /",
    "n for each noisy spectrum .",
    "the results verify that for s / n @xmath56 per pixel ( corresponding roughly to @xmath44 ) , the velocity uncertainty was smaller than @xmath57 km s@xmath18 .",
    "fainter than this , the uncertainty rises exponentially , reaching @xmath58 km s@xmath18 at s / n @xmath59 per pixel ( or @xmath60 ) . in fig .",
    "[ resultserrmag3 ] , the solid line shows the velocity uncertainty increasing with v magnitude , from the _ mknoise _ simulations .",
    "this ideal line is the minimum uncertainty due only to random noise , providing a lower boundary to the observed uncertainties .    in summary , we find that the results generated by _ fxcor _ ( with its uncertainities",
    "as listed in tables  [ newgc ] , [ fsbg ] , &  [ knowngc ] ) provide estimates of the internal velocity uncertainties that are quite close to the estimates from simulations and from comparisons with previous data",
    ". this may in large part be because we deliberately used a standard velocity template which accurately matches the program objects .",
    "we conclude that the internal uncertainties of our measured velocities are near @xmath61 km s@xmath18 for the very brightest clusters , increasing to @xmath58 km s@xmath18 for the ones at @xmath60 or fainter .",
    "a new analysis of the radial velocities and kinematics of the confirmed gcs in ngc 5128 , with a much enlarged cluster sample over that used in pff04 , will be discussed in a later paper @xcite . for the present , we provide here only a brief discussion on the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ mdf ] shows the mdf for a total of 299 gcs in ngc 5128 that are radial - velocity members _ and _ that have available @xmath0 photometric indices : 168 are previously confirmed clusters ( pff04 ) , 31 are the new clusters from this study , and 100 more are from the upcoming study of @xcite .",
    "although there are a few dozen other highly probable gcs that have recently been found in ngc 5128 from image morphology studies @xcite , we restrict the current discussion to an almost certainly `` pure '' sample generated by the combination of object color , morphology , and radial velocity .    the dereddened colors @xmath62 from hhg04 were transformed to [ fe / h ] through the conversion derived by @xcite calibrated through the milky way cluster data .",
    "we adopt a foreground reddening value of @xmath63 for ngc 5128 , corresponding to @xmath64 . because the transformation is slightly nonlinear",
    ", the uncertainty in [ fe / h ] is a function of metallicity . for a typical color uncertainty @xmath65 , the corresponding uncertainty in [ fe / h ] is near @xmath66 dex at the metal - poor end , decreasing to @xmath67 dex at the metal - rich end .",
    "the mdf , binned in steps of @xmath68 } = 0.10 $ ] , is shown in figure [ mdf ] , along with the same distribution for the milky way clusters ( data from * ? ? ?",
    "as has been found in all previous studies of ngc 5128 starting with @xcite , the mdf is extremely broad and populated by roughly equal numbers of metal - poor and metal - rich clusters .",
    "the color bimodality of ngc 5128 has recently been confirmed by @xcite in 4 different photometric indices .",
    "they used spectroscopic line indices of h@xmath69 versus [ mgfe]@xmath70 to suggest the blue gc population was metal - poor and old ( @xmath71 gyr ) and the red gc population was metal - rich and young ( mean age @xmath72 gyr ) .",
    "a bimodal - gaussian distribution ( shown in fig .  [ mdf ] ) provides a reasonable fit to the total mdf , but not as cleanly as in many other giant galaxies including the milky way ( plotted for comparison in the lower panel of the figure ) .",
    "the fit of the bimodal model to the mdf is not well constrained , allowing a wide range of particular combinations of gaussians .",
    "the two centroids shown , at @xmath1 } = -1.46 $ ] and @xmath2 , are similar to the fit obtained by hhg04 ( see their figure  10 ) from a smaller cluster sample .",
    "the metal - poor part of our entire sample makes up @xmath73 of the total population and the metal - rich part @xmath74 , in close agreement with hhg04 .",
    "it does not seem likely that internal differential reddening of the clusters is an important factor in creating the color spread , since reddening - generated differences in color of several tenths of a magnitude would be needed to move a cluster from the metal - poor mode to ( e.g. ) [ fe / h ] @xmath75 , yet all the objects with @xmath0 photometry lie clearly outside the dust lane and into the clear regions of the bulge and halo ( see * ? ? ? * for extensive discussion ) .",
    "as has long been realized , the milky way mdf ( bottom panel in figure  [ mdf ] ) provides a clean match to the bimodal - gaussian model , with peaks at @xmath1 } = -1.58 \\pm 0.05 $ ] and @xmath76 .",
    "the standard deviations are 0.32 and 0.23 for the metal - poor and metal - rich subpopulations , both narrower than their counterparts for ngc 5128 .",
    "both centroids are slightly but noticeably more metal - poor than those in ngc 5128 .    by comparison ,",
    "the mdf of the m31 globular clusters shows [ fe / h ] peaks that are more similar to ngc 5128 .",
    "@xcite find m31 centroids of @xmath1 } = -1.44 \\pm 0.03 $ ] and @xmath77 .",
    "thus , it is likely that if ngc 5128 is a product of major mergers , then it would need m31-sized galaxies as progenitors , rather than systems like the milky way which have lower - metallicity clusters .",
    "if we assume that ngc 5128 was built through a series of mergers extending for several gigayears , then the gcs might contain a wide range of ages .",
    "thus the mdf shown here , based on photometric metallicities from @xmath0 with the assumption that all the clusters are homogeneously old , would underestimate the true metallicity of younger clusters .",
    "this effect would artificially increase the spread in the mdf and partially blur out a distribution that was intrinsically bimodal .",
    "the classic age / metallicity degeneracy for broad band colors prevents us from distinguishing this alternative from an intrinsically broad , even mdf .",
    "figure [ fehv ] displays the ngc 5128 sample divided into bright ( @xmath78 ) and faint ( @xmath79 ) clusters .",
    "interestingly , the fainter sample appears to have a higher proportion of metal - rich clusters than the brighter sample . a direct least - squares correlation of [ fe / h ] versus v magnitude shows no significant trend within the larger scatter in [ fe / h ] .",
    "it is possible that we are simply seeing an intrinsically broad and uniform spread of cluster metallicities , in which the younger and more metal - rich ones tend to be of somewhat lower mass or luminosity , consistent with the age differences suggested by pff04 .",
    "a wide range of ages would further increase the apparent spread of the mdf as seen in fig .",
    "[ fehv ] .",
    "further spectroscopic studies and more detailed modelling will be needed to test these speculations . in later analyses",
    "@xcite we will discuss the age distributions and kinematics of the cluster system further .    in figure [ fehrad ] ,",
    "the cluster metallicities are displayed as a function of projected galactocentric radius .",
    "both metal - poor ( @xmath1 } > -1.0 $ ] ) and metal - rich ( @xmath1 } < -1.0 $ ] ) clusters have been found extending out to a radius of @xmath8 ( @xmath80 kpc ) .",
    "however , beyond @xmath81 , there are double the number of metal - poor compared to metal - rich clusters .",
    "the mean metallicity beyond this distance is @xmath1 } = -1.21 $ ] with a standard deviation of 0.47 . as is discussed in more detail in hhg04",
    ", this change in ratios of subpopulations is not likely to be due to selection bias and is therefore probably intrinsic to the system .",
    "we present new radial velocities for 86 globular cluster candidates selected from @xcite .",
    "the results show 31 newly identified clusters with @xmath22 kms@xmath18 , 24 definite foreground stars with @xmath24 km s@xmath18 , and 31 probable background galaxies .",
    "we also obtained velocities for 43 previously known gcs in ngc 5128 .",
    "the internal uncertainty in our @xmath82 measurements ranges from @xmath61 km s@xmath18 at the bright end of the sample ( @xmath83 to @xmath84 km s@xmath18 at @xmath60 .    combining our data with previously published material , we derive a metallicity distribution for the gcs based on 299 clusters .",
    "a bimodal distribution with centroids at @xmath1 } = -1.46 $ ] and @xmath2 provides an approximate fit to the mdf , though not highly accurate , and the data hint that the relative proportions of metal - poor and metal - rich clusters may change with luminosity .",
    "two possible interpretations are that ( a ) we may be seeing the combined effects of a several - gy internal age spread in the cluster system , combined with a trend for the younger clusters to be progressively less massive , or ( b ) the mdf is genuinely broad and evenly distributed , unlike the more cleanly bimodal mdfs seen in other giant galaxies .",
    "we greatly appreciate the data reduction advice and support provided by knut olsen at ctio , and also advice regarding uncertainty tests from david james at vanderbilt university .",
