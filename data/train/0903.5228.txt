    "in particle theory phenomenology , model building fashions vary with time and because the present lack of data ( soon to be compensated by the large hadron collider ) does not allow discrimination between models some fashions develop a life of their own . in the present talk we take the apparently retrogressive step of imposing the requirement of renormalizability , as holds for quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the standard electroweak model , to show that non - abelian flavor symmetry becomes then much more restrictive and predictive . in a specific model we show that a normal neutrino mass hierarchy is strongly favored over an inverted hierarchy .    for several years",
    "now there has been keen interest in the use of @xmath1 as a finite flavor symmetry in the lepton sector , especially neutrino mixing . in particular , the empirically approximate tribimaximal mixing of the three neutrinos can be predicted .",
    "it is usually stated that either normal or inverted neutrino mass spectrum can be predicted .",
    "we revisit these two questions in a minimal @xmath1 framework with only one @xmath1-*3 * of higgs doublets coupling to neutrinos and permitting only renormalizable couplings .",
    "for such a minimal model there is more predicitivity regarding neutrino masses .",
    "although the standard model was originally discovered using the criterion of renormalizability , it is sometimes espoused that renormalizability is not prerequisite in an effective lagrangian .",
    "nevertheless , imposing renormalizability in the present case is more sensible because it does render the model far more predictive by avoiding the many additional parameters associated with higher - order irrelevant operators .",
    "our choice of higgs sector also minimizes the number of free parameters .",
    "it is sufficiently important to emphasize the concept that every result mentioned in this talk would be impossible without imposing renormalizability .",
    "although it has been fruitful in low - energy qcd , heavy - quark effective theory and technicolor this idea is inappropriate to fundamental model building in particle phenomenology .",
    "the group @xmath1 is the order g=12 symmetry of a regular tetrahedron @xmath2 and is a subgroup of the rotation group @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 has irreducible representations which are three singlets @xmath4 and a triplet @xmath5 . in the embedding",
    "@xmath6 the * 3 * of @xmath1 is identified with the adjoint * 3 * of @xmath3 .",
    "since the only higgs doublets coupling to neutrinos in our model are in a * 3 * of @xmath1 , it is very useful to understand geometrically the three components of a * 3*.    a regular tetrahedron has four vertices , four faces and six edges .",
    "straight lines joining the midpoints of opposite edges pass through the centroid and form a set of three orthogonal axes . regarding the regular tetrahedron as the result of cutting off the four odd corners from a cube , these axes are parallel to the sides of the cube .",
    "with respect to the regular tetrahedron , a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the * 3 * such as @xmath7 , as will be used , clearly breaks so(3 ) to u(1 ) and correspondingly @xmath1 to @xmath8 , since it requires a rotation by @xmath9 about the 3-axis to restore the tetrahedron .    at the same time",
    ", we can understand the appearance of tribimaximal mixing with matrix    @xmath10    and our definitions are such that the ordering @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfy    @xmath13    assuming no cp violation , the majorana matrix @xmath14 is real and symmetric and therefore of the form    @xmath15    and is related to the diagonalized form by    @xmath16    substituting eq.([tbm ] ) into eq.([diag ] ) shows that @xmath14 must be of the general form in terms of real parameters @xmath17 : @xmath18    which has eigenvalues    @xmath19    the observed mass spectrum corresponds approximately to @xmath20 which requires either @xmath21 or @xmath22 . for a normal hierarchy , @xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "for an inverted hierarchy @xmath24 and @xmath21 or @xmath25 .",
    "now we study our minimal @xmath1 model to examine the occurrence of the majorana matrix eq.([abc ] ) and the eigenvalues eq.([masses ] ) .",
    "we assign the leptons to @xmath26 irreps as follows    @xmath27    the lepton lagrangian is    @xmath28 + { \\rm h.c.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29-doublet higgs scalars are in @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the charged lepton masses originate from @xmath32 and are , to leading order , disconnected from the neutrino masses if we choose a flavor basis where the charged leptons are mass eigenstates .",
    "the @xmath33 masses break the @xmath34 symmetry but change the charged lepton masses only by very small amounts @xmath35 at one - loop level .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos have mass matrix    @xmath36    we take the vev of the scalar @xmath37 to be    @xmath38    whereupon the dirac matrix is    @xmath39    the majorana mass matrix @xmath14 is given by    @xmath40    technical details are provided in arxiv:0806.1707 .",
    "our conclusion is that the @xmath1 model in a minimal form does favor the normal hierarchy .",
    "we have considered a more restrictive model based on @xmath1 than previously considered .",
    "the theory has been required to be renormalizable and the higgs scalar content is the minimum possible .",
    "we have required that the neutrino mixing matrix be of the tribimaximal form .",
    "we then find that the masses for the neutrinos are highly constrained and can be in a normal , not inverted hierarchy .",
    "most , if not all , previous @xmath1 models in the literature permit higher - order irrelevant non - renormalizable operators and their concomitant proliferation of parameters and hence allow a wide variety if possiblities for the neutrino masses .",
    "we believe the renormalizabilty condition is sensible for these flavor symmetries because of the higher predictivity .",
    "the next step which is the subject of the rest of this talk is whether the present renornmalizable @xmath1 model can be extended to a renormalizable @xmath0 model .",
    "it is necessary but not sufficent condition for this that a successful renormalizable @xmath1 model , as presented here , exists .",
    "the first use of the binary tetrahedral group @xmath41 in particle physics was @xcite by case , karplus and yang in 1956 who were motivated to consider gauging a finite @xmath0 subgroup of @xmath29 in yang - mills theory . this led fairbairn , fulton and klink ( ffk ) in 1964 to make an analysis@xcite of @xmath0 clebsch - gordan coefficients as a flavor symmetry , @xmath0 first appeared @xcitein 1994 motivated by the idea of representing the three quark families with the third treated differently from the first two .",
    "since @xmath0 is the double cover of @xmath1 , it was natural to suggest that @xmath0 be employed to accommodate quarks and simultaneously the established @xmath1 model building for tribimaximal neutrino mixing .",
    "we shall discuss such a @xmath0 model with simplifications to emphasize the largest quark mixing , the cabibbo angle , for which we shall derive an entirely new formula @xcite as an exact angle .",
    "recall that charged lepton masses arise from the vacuum expectation value    @xmath42    where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "neutrino masses and mixings come from the see - saw mechanism and the vev    @xmath45    we shall now promote @xmath1 to @xmath0 keeping renormalizability and including quarks .",
    "the left - handed quark doublets @xmath46 are assigned under @xmath47 to    @xmath48    and the six right - handed quarks as    @xmath49    we add only two new scalars @xmath50 and @xmath51 whose vevs    @xmath52    provide the @xmath53 masses .",
    "in particular , no @xmath0 doublet ( @xmath54 ) scalars have been added .",
    "this allows a non - zero value only for @xmath55 .",
    "the other angles vanish making the third family stable . and",
    "@xmath56 are related to @xmath57 masses . ]",
    "the allowed quark yukawa and mass terms are    @xmath58    the use of @xmath0 singlets and doublets for quark families in eqs.([ql],[qr ] ) permits the third family to differ from the first two and thus make plausible the mass hierarchies @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the nontrivial ( @xmath62 ) quark mass matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 will be respectively denoted by @xmath65 and @xmath66 and calculated using the @xmath0 clebsch - gordan coefficients of fairbairn , fulton and klink . dividing out @xmath67 and @xmath68 in eq.([yquark ] ) gives @xmath69 and @xmath70 matrices ( @xmath71 )    @xmath72    @xmath73    let us first consider @xmath69 of eq.([umatrix ] ) .",
    "noting that @xmath74 we may simplify @xmath69 by setting the electron mass to zero , @xmath75 .",
    "this renders @xmath69 diagonal leaving free the c , u , @xmath76 and @xmath77 masses .",
    "this leaves only the matrix @xmath70 in eq.([dmatrix ] ) which predicts both @xmath55 and @xmath78 .",
    "the hermitian square @xmath79 is    @xmath80    which leads by diagonalization to a formula for the cabibbo angle    @xmath81    or equivalently @xmath82 close to the experimental value footnoteexperimental results are from pdg2008 ; see references therein .",
    "@xmath83 .",
    "our result of an exact angle for @xmath55 can be regarded as on a footing with the tribimaximal values for neutrino angles @xmath84 .",
    "note that the tribimaximal @xmath85 presently agrees with experiment within one standard deviation ( @xmath86 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our analagous exact angle for @xmath55 differs from experiment already by @xmath87 which is probably a reflection of the fact that the experimental accuracy for @xmath55 is @xmath88 while that for @xmath85 is @xmath89 .",
    "it is thus very important to acquire better experimental data on @xmath85 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 to detect their similar deviation from the exact angles predicted by tbm .",
    "our result for @xmath78 from eq.([dddagger ] ) is exactly @xmath92 compared to the central experimental value @xmath93 in a simplified model whose generalization to an extended scalar sector including @xmath0 doublets can avoid @xmath94 and thereby change @xmath78 due to mixing of @xmath57 with the @xmath95 quark .",
    "this @xmath96 extension of the standard model is an first step to tying the quark and lepton sectors together , providing calculability , and at the same time reducing the number of standard model parameters .",
    "the ultimate goal would be to understand the origin of this discrete symmetry .",
    "since gauge symmetries can break to discrete symmetries , and gauge symmetries arise naturally from strings , perhaps there is a clever construction of our model with its fundamental origin in string theory .",
    "renormalizability and simplification of @xmath97 then @xmath47 models lead to :          k.m . case , r. karplus and c.n .",
