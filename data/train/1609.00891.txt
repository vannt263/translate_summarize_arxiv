    "the energy distribution problem @xcite is one of the fundamental problems in communication engineering .",
    "it aims at finding the energy distribution of signals in time and frequency domains .",
    "in particular , researchers take particular note of finding the signals with maximum energy concentration in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously . in the early 1960 s , d. slepian ,",
    "h. landau and h. pollak @xcite have found that the prolate spheroidal wave functions ( pswfs ) are the most optimal energy concentration functions in a euclidean space of finite dimension .",
    "the pswfs , also known as slepian functions , are bandlimited and exhibit interesting orthogonality relations .",
    "they are normalized versions of the solutions to the helmholtz wave equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates . from then on , theory and numerical applications of these functions",
    "have been developed rapidly .",
    "they are often regarded as somewhat mysterious , with no explicit or standard representation in terms of elementary functions and too difficult to compute numerically .",
    "the one - dimensional pswfs have so far mainly been developed in two different directions .",
    "one is that fast and highly accurate methods have been deeply developed for the approximation of the pswfs and their eigenvalues @xcite . from a computational point of view , the pswfs provide a natural and efficient tool for computing with bandlimited functions defined on an interval @xcite .",
    "they are preferable to classical polynomial bases ( such as legendre and chebychev polynomials ) . on the other hand , analytical properties of the pswfs",
    "have been proposed of the more general context of a variety of function spaces such as hypercomplex and cliffordian spaces and under different integral transforms @xcite .",
    "the frequency domain has indeed been considered not only under the fourier transform , but also under more general ones such as the fractional fourier transform @xcite , linear canonical transform ( lct ) @xcite and so forth . over the past few years",
    "the pswfs have come to play a very active part in some problems arising from applications to physical sciences and engineering , such as wave scattering , signal processing , and antenna theory .",
    "these applications have stimulated a surge of new ideas and methods , both theoretical and applied , and have reawakened an interest in approximation theory , potential theory and the theory of partial differential equations .    in the present paper , we discuss the energy concentration problem of bandlimited quaternionic signals under the quaternionic fourier transform , which is a generalization of the fourier transform to quaternionic signals @xcite .",
    "quaternions were first applied to the fourier transform within the general context of solving problems in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging by r. r. ernst in the 1980s @xcite . in the quaternionic language",
    "the hamiltonian multiplication rules @xcite make the underlying elements of having a non - commutative property leading to the main difficulty for the analysis of some basic properties of those elements in certain spaces . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are no previous works considering the energy concentration problem in a non - commutative structure as in the case of the quaternionic ( or , more general , the clifford ) algebra .",
    "this understanding can be the basis for more generalizations .",
    "for this reason , the purpose of the present paper is to develop the energy extremal properties between the time and frequency domains involving quaternionic signals .",
    "we find that the quaternionic prolate spheroidal wave functions ( qpswfs ) preserve the high energy concentration in both the time and frequency domains under the quaternionic fourier transform .",
    "although we concentrate mainly on fourier bandlimited signals , it however might also be applied for lct bandlimited cases as is shown in one of our preceding papers @xcite .",
    "the body of the present paper will cover the following sequence of topics : in section [ s2 ] , we collect some basic concepts of quaternionic analysis and quaternionic fourier transform to be used throughout the paper .",
    "section [ s3 ] introduces the qpswfs .",
    "the qpswfs are ideally suited to study certain questions regarding the relationship between quaternionic signals and their fourier transforms .",
    "we prove that the qpswfs are orthogonal and complete on both the square integrable space of finite interval and the two - dimensional paley - wiener space of bandlimited quaternionic signals .",
    "section [ s4 ] describes the time - limited and bandlimited quaternionic signals and their corresponding properties using the qpswfs . in section [ s5 ] , we present the energy extremal properties of the qpswfs in the time and frequency domains .",
    "in particular , if a finite energy signal is given , the possible proportions of its energy in a finite time - domain and a finite frequency - domain are found , as well as the signals which do the best job of simultaneous time and frequency concentration .",
    "we find that the qpswfs can reach the extreme case of the energy relationships .",
    "in section [ s6 ] , the qpswfs are used in the bandlimited extrapolation problem and achieved good results .",
    "section [ s7 ] concludes the paper .",

    "hamilton in 1843 . it is a kind of hypercomplex numbers related to the rotations in three - dimensional space , which likes complex numbers used to represent rotations in the two - dimensional plane .",
