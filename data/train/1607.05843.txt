    "we deal with point - like electrons and such mechanism of generating effective three - particle interactions is absent .",
    "however , atoms have electronic shell structure and interactions between valence electrons are modified by the stronger bound core electrons , which form a kind of inhomogeneous dielectric medium .",
    "this is known as the core - polarization , or the screening effect and is described by the diagrams of the type of fig .",

    "the loop in this diagram includes the sums over all core states @xmath5 and all possible states @xmath6 above the core .",

    "this approach combines the configuration interaction ( ci ) method for treating valence correlations with mbpt for core - valence and core - core correlations . since then this method was used for calculations of various properties of polyvalent atoms with several closed core shells @xcite .",

    "two very important experimental steps toward development of new frequency standards with these systems and subsequent application to the search for a possible variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath6 were recently completed .",

    "we expect that valence @xmath16 orbitals have large overlap with the core shell @xmath30 , significantly enhancing three - particle interactions . since prediction of accurate transition energies in these highly - charged ions is crucial for rapid experimental progress , it is important to evaluate the tei contributions in these systems , which have been so far omitted in all relevant hci calculations .",
    "in this paper we study the role of such effective three - electron interactions in the spectra of polyvalent atoms and ions .",

    "the core - valence and core - core correlations are treated using the linearized coupled - cluster method in the single - double approximation @xcite instead of the second order mbpt used in the ci+mbpt approach .",
    "a complete treatment of the tei at the ci+ao level involves modification of the tei diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_3n].c to the form presented in fig .  [ fig_3cluster ] , where one coulomb - breit interaction is substituted by the respective cluster core - valence amplitude @xcite",
    ". however , we find it sufficient to carry out ci+ao calculations of the wavefunctions and then treat tei corrections within the second order mbpt for the systems of interest .",
    "our initial approximation corresponds to the hartree - fock potential of the core , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of core electrons .",
    "such approximation completely neglects interactions between valence electrons and may be too crude for some neutral polyvalent atoms @xcite , but is sufficiently good for hcis .",
    "next , we form an effective hamiltonian for valence electrons : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hamiltonian in the frozen - core approximation , which includes coulomb - breit interactions between valence electrons and the core potential @xmath35 .    the energy - dependent operator @xmath39 accounts for the core polarization effects , such as in fig .  [ fig_3n].b .",
    "in the second order of mbpt this operator is a three - electron operator . in higher orders it is the @xmath40-electron operator , where @xmath40 is the number of valence electrons ( we assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the total number of electrons in the system ) . at this stage",
    "we neglect three - electron and many - electron interactions and consider operator @xmath43 as a two - electron operator .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath43 are given in refs .",
    "we use the davidson algorithm to find @xmath44 lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath45 ( typically @xmath46 ) .",
    "selection rules for three - electron matrix elements are much weaker than for two - electron ones and the number of nonzero matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian drastically increases .",
    "consequently , the matrix becomes less sparse .",
    "forming and diagonalizing such matrix in a complete configurational space is impractically time - consuming .",
    "instead , we include tei by forming a small @xmath47 matrix using eigenfunctions from the previous stage of the computation .",
    "diagonalization of this matrix gives us eigenvalues with tei corrections .",
    "this approach radically reduces the number of required three - electron diagrams without significant loss of accuracy .",

    "<S> we study effective three - particle interactions between valence electrons , which are induced by the core polarization . </S>",
    "<S> such interactions are enhanced when valence orbitals have strong overlap with the outermost core shell , in particular for the systems with partially filled @xmath0-shell . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in certain cases the three - particle contributions are large , affecting the order of energy levels , and need to be included in high - precision calculations . </S>"
