    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are the most populous , old and dense stellar aggregates in the galaxy .",
    "they are formed by millions of stars , whose age , distance and chemical composition can be determined with great accuracy . for this reason gcs play a crucial role in the current understanding of stellar and dynamical evolution and they represent the ideal target to constrain the interplay between the `` environment '' and the evolution of stars .",
    "the average age of galactic gcs ( ggcs ; @xmath0 gyr ) is typically significantly larger than the time - scales in which the internal dynamical processes occur ( meylan & heggie 1997 ) . during their evolution",
    ", gcs can survive the early expansion triggered by primordial gas expulsion and mass loss due to stellar evolution , then their evolution is mainly driven by two - body relaxation thus reaching higher central concentrations and eventually the core collapse , while loosing stars through the boundary set by the tidal field of their host galaxy ( see for example heggie & hut 2003 ) .",
    "two - body relaxation drives the long - term dynamical evolution of gcs . because of this physical process",
    ", heavier objects tend to sink toward the cluster centers ( mass segregation ) , while less massive stars are forced towards more external orbits .",
    "the typical time - scale in which two - body relaxation occurs scales with the number of stars ( spitzer 1987 ) and it is typically of the order of 1 - 2 gyr in gcs ( meylan & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "the internal dynamics of stellar aggregates affect objects of any mass and it can be efficiently probed by means of massive test particles , like blue straggler stars ( bsss ) , binaries and millisecond pulsars ( e.g. ferraro et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) . among them , bsss have been successfully used for this purpose , since they are numerous and relatively easy to measure . indeed , ferraro et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have shown that the bss radial distribution can be efficiently used to rank clusters according to their dynamical age . using this approach ,",
    "evidence of mass segregation has been observed in all gcs studied so far , with only very few exceptions : @xmath1 centauri , ngc  2419 , palomar  14 , terzan  8 and arp  2 , where the bss radial distribution has been found to be indistinguishable from that of any other population ( ferraro et al . 2006 ; dalessandro et al .",
    "2008b ; beccari et al .",
    "2011 ; salinas et al . 2012 ) .",
    "in general , for clusters that havent reached relaxation yet , the radial distribution of stars of any mass is expected to be the same ( apart from possible primordial dissimilarities ) .",
    "the lack of mass segregation in ngc  2419 has been confirmed by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2012 ) studying the the radial variation of the luminosity function ( lf ) of main sequence ( ms ) stars at different radii , while it has been questioned for palomar  14 by frank et al .",
    "( 2014 ) who observed an increase of the slope of the stellar mass function for increasing distance from the cluster center , as expected for relaxed systems .    as a part of a large observational campaign aimed at deriving the binary fraction in the external regions of ggcs , we present results about the dynamical state of the low mass ( @xmath2 ; harris 1996- 2010 edition ) gc ngc  6101 .",
    "this is an old ( @xmath3 gyr , dotter et al .",
    "2010 ) , metal poor ( @xmath4=-1.98 $ ] ; carretta et al . 2009 ) galactic halo gc , with a low concentration ( @xmath5 ; harris 1996 ) .",
    "a recent analysis of its rrlyrae content ( cohen et al . 2011 ) revealed that ngc  6101 is an oosterhoff type ii cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the metallicity of the cluster , but it is unusual for its kinematical properties .",
    "in fact ngc  6101 is one of the very few metal - poor gcs in the galaxy with a retrograde motion . because of its peculiar kinematical properties it has been possibly connected ( martin et al . 2004 ) to the canis major dwarf galaxy .",
    "the stellar content of ngc  6101 has been studied by sarajedini & da costa ( 1991 ) and later on by marconi et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter m01 ) . in particular m01 performed a detailed analysis of the radial distributions of different stellar populations of ngc  6101 .",
    "they found that horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and bss are more centrally concentrated than ms - turn off stars .",
    "they interpreted this behavior as evidence of mass segregation among different populations .    in this study",
    "we investigate the dynamical state of ngc  6101 by using three diagnostics : the radial distribution of _",
    "( i ) _ bsss , _",
    "( ii ) _ ms binaries , and _ ( iii ) _ genuine ms stars with different masses . according to these three indicators , and at odds with the results of m01",
    ", we find that ngc  6101 does not show evidence of mass segregation .",
    "we compare this observational fact with theoretical expectations and the new dynamical timescale estimates obtained from the newly derived structural parameters .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  2 we present the details of our observations and the adopted data reduction procedures ; in section  3 we derive the main structural parameters of the cluster ; in section  4 the bss radial distribution is analyzed and compared to that of the reference populations ; in section  5 we study the binary content of ngc  6101 at different distances from the center and in section  6 we analyze the radial variations of the luminosity and mass function of ms stars .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized and discussed in section  7 .",
    "the data set used in this paper consists of a combination of images obtained with both the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and ground based facilities ( see figure  1 ) .    for the analysis of the bss radial distribution ( see section  4 ) , we used two publicly available catalogs .",

    "the @xmath12 pixels mit red- optimized ccd mosaic in the standard resolution mode ( @xmath13 ) was adopted for these observations , thus to sample the largest possible field of view ( fov ; @xmath14 ) .",
    "three pointings complementary to the _ acs _ sample have been set up ( see figure  1 ) starting from @xmath15 ( and reaching @xmath16 ) from the center of the cluster . for each pointing , eight images in the @xmath11 band with exposure time @xmath17 sec each and four in @xmath10 with @xmath18 sec , have been obtained .",
    "a dither pattern of few arcsec has been adopted to allow a better reconstruction of the point spread function ( psf ) and avoid ccd blemishes and artifacts .",

    "2014 ) by using ` daophotii ` ( stetson 1987 ) . for each frame we selected several tens of bright , not saturated and relatively isolated stars to model the psf , which turned out to be well reproduced by a moffat function ( moffat 1969 ) .",

    ", a fit was forced with ` daophotii / allframe ` .",
    "for each star different magnitude estimates in each filter were homogenized and their weighted mean and standard deviation were finally adopted as star magnitude and photometric error ( see for example ferraro et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "we used the stars in common with the stetson photometric secondary standard catalog ( stetson 2000 ) to report the instrumental magnitudes to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 johnson bands .",
    "instrumental coordinates ( x , y ) have been reported to the absolute ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) system by using the stars in common with the gsc2.3 catalog and the cross - correlation tool ` cataxcorr ` . at this stage",

    "they have been combined to form a single catalog that we defined _",

    "a color equation was adopted to calibrate the @xmath30 band , while a zeropoint was enough for the @xmath32 band .",
    "instrumental coordinates have been reported to the absolute system for each of the eight wfi chips using the stars in common with gsc2.3 , as done before .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 cmd is shown in the right panel of figure  3 .",
    "we emphasize that for all catalogs , the magnitudes are in the johnson - cousin photometric system . to avoid confusion , in the following",

    "we used the _ acs _ and _ wfi _ data sets to compute the density profile of ngc  6101 from direct star counts . in particular , the sample is composed of all stars in the _ acs _ catalog and those in the complementary _ wfi _ data - set .",
    "we used stars with @xmath38 to avoid incompleteness and saturation problems .",
    "as done in other works ( see for example dalessandro et al .",
    "2013a ) , we divided the fov in 17 concentric annuli ( five of them are in the _ acs _ fov ) centered on the center of gravity ( c@xmath39 ) , which we have adopted to be the one reported by goldsbury at al .",
    "( 2010 ; @xmath40 , @xmath41 )",
    ". each annulus has been then split in an adequate number of sub - sectors ( ranging from two to four ) according to the local density of stars and the angular coverage in the _ wfi _ fov .",
    "number counts have been calculated in each subsector and the corresponding densities were obtained dividing them by the sampled area .",
    "particular attention has been paid to incomplete area coverage of the _ wfi _ data set starting from @xmath42 and to the inter - chip gaps .",
    "the stellar density of each annulus was then defined as the average of the subsector densities , and its standard deviation was computed from the variance among the subsectors .",
    "we made sure to guarantee some radial overlap between the two samples in order to homogenize the two portions of the density profile .",
    "the resulting surface density profile is shown in figure  4 .",
    "we estimated the contribution of the galactic field background by averaging the densities of the five outermost measures , corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "we obtain an average background density of @xmath44 stars arcsec@xmath45 .",
    "we have verified that the observed background density is fully consistent with that obtained by using the besancon galaxy model simulation ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) covering an area of @xmath46 centered on the position of ngc  6101 and for stars in the same magnitude limit used to build the density profile .",
    "this density has been subtracted to the observed density profile to obtain a  decontaminated \" density distribution ( solid symbols in figure  4 ) . as apparent from the figure",
    ", the background in the external regions of ngc  6101 does not appear to be constant at odds with what expected , but it mildly increases as a function of the distance .",
    "this behavior introduces some uncertainties on the background density estimate .",
    "however we have checked that variations of the background density within intervals compatible with the observations do not affect significantly the density distribution .",
    "we fit the radial density profile by using an isotropic single - mass king model ( king 1966 ) following the procedure fully described in miocchi et al .",
    "the model best - fitting the observed density profile has a concentration @xmath47 and core radius @xmath48 , which yield a tidal radius @xmath49 .",
    "we also derive the projected half light radius ( effective radius ) @xmath50 .",
    "the newly determined structural parameters are in partial disagreement with those found in the literature and they make ngc  6101 more concentrated and extended than previously thought . in particular , @xmath51 is compatible within the errors with the one listed by harris ( 1996 , @xmath52 ) , while the values of @xmath53 ( and as a consequence @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 are much larger than in harris ( 1996 ; @xmath5 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "the same result comes out also from the comparison with the values obtained by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) , who quote @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we argue that the difference between our parameters and the literature is mainly due to the fact that both harris ( 1996 ) and mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) made use of non homogeneous surface brightness profiles that are limited to the innermost @xmath60 from the center not allowing for an appropriate background subtraction .",
    "we have estimated the distance modulus and reddening of ngc  6101 by comparing its cmd to that of m  30 ( ngc  7099 ) .",
    "m  30 can be used as a template for this analysis since it has a similar metallicity ( @xmath4=-2.33\\pm0.2 $ ] ; carretta et al .",
    "2009 ) and its distance has been robustly determined because of its proximity . to guarantee homogeneity , we compared the _ acs _ sample of ngc  6101 with the cmd of m  30 obtained with the same instrument within the same survey ( sarajedini et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we reported the cmd of m  30 in the absolute plane @xmath61 by adopting as distance modulus @xmath62 and reddening @xmath63 ( ferraro et al .",
    "2009 ) . to overlap the cmds and align all the main evolutionary sequences in the absolute plane ( see figure  5 ) , we needed to adopt @xmath64 and reddening @xmath65 for ngc  6101 , which yield to a true ( unreddened ) distance modulus @xmath66 and thus to a distance @xmath67 kpc .",
    "we used these values throughout the paper .",
    "these values are slightly larger than those obtained in the literature , but in most cases they are still compatible within the errors . in particular , harris ( 1996 ) report @xmath68 and @xmath69 , sarajedini & da costa ( 1991 ) found @xmath70 and @xmath71 , m01 obtained @xmath72 @xmath73 , while cohen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) estimated @xmath74 @xmath73 from the average luminosity of rrlyrae stars and zahb fit .",
    "bsss in gcs are commonly defined as those stars located along an extrapolation of the ms , in a region brighter and bluer than the turn - off ( to ) point in the optical cmd ( sandage 1962 ) .",
    "their location suggests that they are more massive than the current cluster population ( see for example ferraro et al .",
    "2006 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "indeed observational evidence ( shara et al . 1997 ; gilliland et al . 1998 ; fiorentino et al .",
    "2014 ) showed that bsss have masses of @xmath75 compared to a mass of @xmath76 for stars at the ms - to of an old stellar system .",
    "because of their mass , bsss are heavily affected by dynamical friction and thus they can be used as natural test particles to probe the internal dynamics of stellar aggregates . in particular , their radial distribution has been found to probe the efficiency of dynamical friction ( mapelli et al . 2006 ; alessandrini et al . 2014",
    "; miocchi et al . 2015 ) .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2012 ) suggested that the bss radial distribution can be used to define the so called _ dynamical clock _ which is a powerful indicator of the cluster dynamical age . in this picture gcs with a flat bss radial distribution are dynamically young stellar systems and they are defined as _ family i _ gcs , clusters with a bimodal radial distribution have intermediate dynamical ages ( _ family ii _ ) , while those with a centrally peaked and monotonically decreasing bss distribution are dynamically old ( _ family iii _ ) .",
    "the bss population of ngc  6101 has been studied by sarajedini & da costa ( 1991 ) and m01 . in particular m01",
    "studied also the bss radial distribution by using a combination of hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( defined _ `` hst '' sample _ ) and ground based data ( _ `` ground '' sample _ ) corresponding to the _ danish _ sample defined in section  2 . by using cumulative radial distributions and kolmogorov - smirnov tests , they concluded that bsss have a large probability ( 84@xmath77 ) to have been extracted from the same parent population as hb , while hb and tip rgb stars being more centrally concentrated than ms - to stars .",
    "they interpreted these results as evidence of mass segregation .",
    "we studied the bss population of ngc  6101 by using the _ acs _ and _ danish _ data sets . in detail , the final sample consists of stars in the _ acs _ catalog and those present in the _ danish _ data set and complementary to the _ acs _ fov ( see figure  1 ) . in this way the central region of ngc  6101",
    "is homogeneously covered up to a distance @xmath78 ( corresponding to about @xmath79 ) from @xmath80 .",
    "while the _ wfi _ data set covers a larger fov and ensures a complete sampling of the cluster up to @xmath54 , we preferred this combination of catalogs for the bss analysis because of the better photometric quality of the data ( see figures  2 and 3 ) .",
    "as done in previous works ( see for example ferraro et al .",
    "1997 , 2004 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007a , b ; dalessandro et al . 2008a and",
    "reference therein ) , in order to study the bss radial distribution , we need a homogeneous selection of bsss and at least one reference stellar population . for the case of ngc  6101 we selected hb , rgb and ms - to stars as reference .",
    "bsss have been selected following the definition of stars bluer and brighter than to .",
    "the selection box shown in figure  6 follows the well defined bss sequence brighter than @xmath81 .",
    "an additional constraint on the color ( @xmath82 ) has been adopted to avoid contamination and blends from ms and sgb stars . in this way we selected 52 bsss , 33 in the _ acs _ fov and 19 in the complementary _ danish _ sample . because of the more conservative selection criteria adopted in this work , the bss sample is smaller than the one obtained by m01 , who identified 73 bss adopting different magnitude and color selections . as for the reference populations , we selected rgb stars along the rgb and having @xmath83 . with these limits we selected a total of 510 rgb stars , 328 in the _ acs _ sample and 182 in the _ danish _ one .",
    "we selected hb stars following their well defined sequence for @xmath82 to minimize the impact of field contamination .",
    "in fact , as apparent from figure  6 , the galactic field describes a vertical sequence in the color range @xmath84 .",
    "the hb selection box is shown in figure  6 and encloses 137 stars . by using the list of known rrlyrae stars ( liller 1981 ; cohen et al .",
    "2011 ; fitzgerald et al .",
    "2012 ) , we identified 11 stars in common , seven in the _ acs _ and four in the _ danish _ fovs .",
    "the rrlyrae falling outside the hb selection were added to the hb sample . in this way",
    "we count 102 and 42 hb stars in the _ acs _ and _ danish _ samples respectively . in order to provide a direct comparison with m01",
    ", we used also ms - to stars as additional reference population .",
    "they have been selected approximately within the limits @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "it is worth noting that in this magnitude range , ms stars have a completeness of @xmath87 both in the _ acs _ ( see section  5.1 ) and in the complementary data - set ( m01 ) .",
    "we count 3125 ms - to stars in total , 2375 in the _ acs _ and 750 in the complementary _ danish _ fovs .",
    "we obtained an estimate of the galaxy field contamination by using the besancon galaxy model simulation ( see section  3 ) .",
    "we counted the number of stars lying in the adopted @xmath7 selection boxes .",
    "we find 125 and 455 galactic field ms - to and rgb stars respectively , yielding densities @xmath88 stars arcsec@xmath45 and @xmath89 stars arcsec@xmath45 .",
    "we do nt find any field star falling in the boxes adopted to select hb and bss stars .",
    "we first compared the bss cumulative radial distribution to those of the reference populations .",
    "as done in dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2013b ) , we took into account the effect of galactic field contamination by statistically decontaminating the rgb and ms populations .",
    "we divided the fov into four concentric annuli centered on @xmath80 and for each of them we randomly subtracted a number of stars corresponding to the average field densities quoted above .",
    "the decontaminated cumulative radial distributions are shown in figure  7 .",
    "as apparent , the four populations show very similar behaviors .",
    "indeed when a ks test is applied , we obtain probabilities @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 that they are extracted from a different parent population . since they are well below the canonical probability limit of @xmath93 , we can conclude that in all cases the differences in the observed radial distributions are not significant . also , we obtain that the radial distributions of the parent populations ( hb , rgb and ms ) are consistent with all being extracted from the same parent distribution .",
    "these results are in good agreement with what found by m01 as far as the analysis is limited to hb , rgb and bss stars , while a different behavior is observed for ms stars .",
    "in fact , m01 found the bss population to be significantly more centrally segregated than ms stars . in order to compare more accurately our results with m01 , we used also their _ `` hst '' sample _ and selected stellar populations using the same boxes defined above . also in this case",
    ", we do not find any significant difference among the radial distribution of rgb , hb and bss and that of ms stars .",
    "we also analyzed the radial distribution of the specific frequencies @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the number of stars in the corresponding population .",
    "we divided the fov into four concentric annuli centered on @xmath80 and in each of them we counted the number of bss and that of the reference population stars .",
    "galaxy field contamination has been accounted as described above .",
    "the radial distributions of the specific frequencies are shown in figure  8 . in all cases , and in agreement with what observed from the cumulative radial distributions , we find that these ratios are almost constant over the entire extension of the _ acs _ + _ danish _ fov ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "we computed also the double normalized ratio ( @xmath99 , where pop = rgb and bss .",
    "@xmath100 is the luminosity sampled in each annulus and estimated by using the best - fit king model , distance modulus and reddening derived in section  3 , @xmath101 is instead the luminosity sampled in the entire field of view . ] ; ferraro et al .",
    "1993 ) for bss and rgb stars .",
    "in particular , for the same annuli used before , we estimated the sampled luminosity using the best - fit king model discussed in section  3 , a distance modulus @xmath102 and reddening @xmath103 .",
    "we find that the @xmath99 is constant for both rgb stars and bsss as expected for any post - ms population ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) .",
    "the same result is obtained when hb and ms stars are considered .",
    "although this analysis does not cover the entire extension of ngc  6101 ( it is limited to @xmath104 ) , we note that the considered data - sets sample about the @xmath105 of the total luminosity of the cluster . on the basis of what observed in tens of gcs ( ferraro et al .",
    "2012 ) , we do not expect any significant deviation from the general behavior at larger distances .",
    "therefore we can safely conclude that the bss radial distribution of ngc  6101 is flat ( i.e. , indistinguishable from that of the reference populations ) .",
    "such a distribution is not common for gcs and it has been observed only in few other cases so far ( @xmath1 centauri - ferraro et al .",

    "palomar  14 - beccari et al .",
    "2011 ; ter  8 and arp  2 - salinas et al .",
    "2012 ) . as for those gcs ,",
    "a flat bss radial distribution is a strong indication of the absence of mass segregation in ngc  6101 .",
    "the fraction of binaries is an essential component of the formation and evolutionary processes of stellar systems . in",
    "dynamically active aggregates as gcs , binaries are thought to promote the formation of exotic objects like bsss , x - ray sources and millisecond pulsars ( see e.g. mc crea et al . 1964 , paresce et al .",

    "2003 ; pooley & hut 2006 ; xin et al .",
    "binaries are typically more massive than the average single star mass in gcs ( @xmath106 ) , therefore they tend to sink towards the center of gcs because of dynamical friction . as a consequence ,",
    "also their radial distribution can be an useful tool to constrain the dynamical state of gcs .    up to now , three main techniques have been used to measure the binary fraction : _",
    "( i ) _ radial velocity variability ( e.g. mathieu & geller 2009 ) , _ ( ii ) _ search for eclipsing binaries ( e.g. mateo 1996 ; cote et al .",

    "the basic idea is that the magnitude of the binary system corresponds to the luminosity of the primary star ( more massive ) increased by that of the companion .",
    "stars on the ms obey a mass - luminosity relation , hence the luminosity of the binary system is a function of the mass ratio @xmath107 of the two components ( where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the masses of the primary and secondary , respectively ) .",

    "@xmath128 was then determined from the comparison between the artificial and the observed cmds : the value of @xmath138 providing the best match between the two cmds is adopted as global binary fraction @xmath128 . in particular , from the simulated catalog we computed the ratio @xmath141 between the number of binary stars defined as before and that of the synthetic ms population .",

    "in relaxed stellar systems , the slope of the lfs is expected to vary as a function of the distance from the cluster center , with indexes decreasing as the distance increases , because of the differential effect of mass segregation .    to study the lf of ngc  6101 we used the _ acs _ and _ fors2 _ samples .",
    "we selected a sample of bona - fide stars along the ms , defined as those stars located within @xmath150 from the mean ridge line , where @xmath19 is the combined photometric uncertainty in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands .",
    "we used the same radial bins defined in section  5 for the binary fraction analysis . for each radial interval we obtained the completeness - corrected lf for stars fainter than @xmath151 and reaching the magnitude limit where the completeness parameter @xmath120 is @xmath130 .",

    ", it well reproduces the behavior observed in the more external radial bins after a proper normalization .",
    "the key result of figure  12 is that , in the range of magnitude and radial extension ( @xmath152 ) covered by our analysis , the shape of the different lf is clearly the same and any subtle difference lies well within the combined uncertainty of the lfs and of the adopted normalization .",
    "we derived the mass function ( mf ) of the same bona - fide stars used for the lf and within the same magnitude limits .",
    "masses have been obtained by using the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) mass - luminosity relation .",
    "the mfs obtained in the same radial bins as the lfs are shown in figure  13 .",
    "the mf obtained in the _ acs _ sample goes down to @xmath153 , while it reaches at most @xmath154 in the _ fors2 _ data set . as done before , we used the mf of the innermost radial bin as reference , and we normalized the more external ones to this by using number counts in the mass range @xmath155 .",
    "as apparent from figure  13 , and in agreement with what obtained from the analysis of the lfs , all mfs are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "three distinct indicators , namely the radial distribution of bsss , binaries stars and the lf of ms stars have been investigated to study the mass segregation in ngc  6101 .",
    "we have traced this effect by using stars in a wide range of masses , going from @xmath156 , corresponding to the lowest mass ms stars , up to @xmath157 reached by the highest mass bsss and binaries .",
    "the results clearly indicate that the cluster do not show evidence of mass segregation up to @xmath122 ( @xmath158 ) from the cluster center .",
    "only few other ggcs are known to be in such a dynamical state : massive systems ( @xmath159 ) , namely @xmath1  centauri ( ferraro et al .",
    "2006a ) and ngc  2419 ( dalessandro et al .",
    "2008b ) , and three gcs that are at the low mass end distribution ( @xmath160 ) , namely palomar  14 ( beccari et al . 2011 ) , ter  8 and arp  2 ( salinas et al .",
    "similarly to these clusters , ngc  6101 can be considered dynamically young .",
    "starting from the new structural parameters obtained in section  3 , we derived the central ( @xmath161 ) and half mass radius ( @xmath162 ) relaxation times following the formulae by spitzer ( 1987 ) .",
    "we adopted the same values of @xmath163 and @xmath28 used in section  4.2 , which yield a distance from the sun @xmath164 kpc ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we estimated the total cluster mass @xmath165 by adopting an integrated v magnitude @xmath166 ( harris 1996 ) and a mass - to - light ratios @xmath167 and 2.07 ( maraston et al .",
    "1998 ) , appropriate for a salpeter and kroupa imf respectively , and for a population of metallicity @xmath4=-2.25 $ ] and age @xmath168 gyr .",
    "we obtained @xmath169 which gives a central mass density @xmath170 pc@xmath171 .",
    "we thus obtained @xmath172 gyr and @xmath173 gyr .",
    "the value of @xmath174 is consistent with what reported by harris ( 1996 ) , while @xmath175 is about three times larger than the harris value ( @xmath176 gyr ) and more than five times larger than the one derived by mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 ( @xmath177 gyr ) .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with @xmath55 being larger than previous estimates reported in the literature .",
    "we note however that both @xmath174 and @xmath175 are significantly smaller than the age of ngc  6101 ( @xmath178 gyr ; dotter et al .",
    "therefore some evidence of mass segregation should be visible , at odds with the observed flat distribution of bss and binaries , and the constant slope of the mf lfs . in the cases of ngc  2419 and palomar  14 , @xmath162 has been estimated to be @xmath179 gyr ( dalessandro et al .",
    "2008b ; sollima et al . 2011 ) , in good agreement with the observational evidence of a lack of mass segregation , at least in the external regions .",
    "however also for ngc  2419 , the central relaxation time is significantly smaller ( @xmath180 gyr ) than the age of the cluster ( @xmath181 gyr ) and ferraro et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found for @xmath1  centauri a relatively short relaxation time ( @xmath182 gyr ) , as for ngc  6101 . in the case of @xmath1  centauri a number of possibilities to understand this apparent disagreement between observations and theoretical results were examined .",
    "cluster rotation can play a role .",
    "in fact angular momentum tends to keep stars out of the core , balancing the effect of mass segregation ( spurzem 2001 ) .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath1 centauri could have been hundreds of time more massive in the past than observed today .",
    "indeed it has been suggested to be the relic of a partially disrupted galaxy ( bekki & freeman 2003 ; tsuchiya et al .",
    "the same argument can be applied to ngc  2419 ( van den bergh & mackey 2004 ; mackey & van den bergh 2005 ) and the extended tidal tails observed around palomar  14 ( sollima et al .",
    "2011 ) would suggest that it experienced quite recent and efficient tidal stripping events .    for the case of ngc  6101 no evidence of internal rotation are known .",
    "however we may speculate that ngc  6101 could have experienced a quite complex dynamical history . by means of dynamical simulations , martin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that ngc  6101 can be associated to the canis major dwarf galaxy accreted to the galactic halo after an encounter between the dwarf and the dark matter halo of the milky way .",
    "indeed the kinematical properties of ngc  6101 are atypical for systems with its metallicity and age .",
    "in fact it is one of the very few metal - poor and old ggcs with a retrograde motion ( geisler et al .",
    "1995 ; rutledge et al .",
    "mackey & gilmore ( 2004 ) suggested that the existence of old gcs with large cores in a relative proximity to the galactic center ( as for the case of ngc  6101 ) can be explained by the fact that they follow wide orbits in which they spend little time close to the galactic center .",
    "alternatively , they could have been accreted only recently by the galactic halo .    in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that a linear fit to the mfs in figure  12 limited to the stars with @xmath183 gives a power - law index @xmath184 . with such a value and with the new estimate of the central concentration obtained in section  3 ( @xmath185 )",
    ", ngc  6101 would nicely fit the correlation found by de marchi , paresce & pulone ( 2007 ) according to which less concentrated gcs tend to have flatter mfs .",
    "this behavior was interpreted by the authors as an indication of a more efficient loss of low mass stars via evaporation and tidal stripping in less concentrated clusters . to support this possibility , evidence of tidal arms and distortions",
    "should be searched for this cluster .    on the other hand , the observational facts collected in the case of ngc  2419",
    ", @xmath1 cen and ngc  6101 suggest that the current theoretical estimates of the central relaxation time are extremely rough and must be used ( at least in absolute terms ) with caution . on the other side",
    "the nice agreement among the different mass segregation indicators used in the case of ngc  6101 provides additional support to the use of the radial distribution of bss ( the so called `` dynamical clock '' ) as a powerful indicator of the dynamical evolution of stellar systems ( ferraro et al .",
    "in fact , among the adopted mass - segregation indicators , bsss are significantly brighter than the others ( ms stars and binaries ) , their analysis is simpler and less prone to observational bias ( as completeness ) and assumptions .",
