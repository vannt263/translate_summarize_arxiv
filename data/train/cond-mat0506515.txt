    "the unusual physics of the cuprates , and specifically the occurrence of high-@xmath5 superconductivity ( sc ) in them @xcite , continues to be one of the forefront problems in physics . even though numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain this puzzling system ( _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a consensus has not been reached yet .",
    "the cuprates , as well as related systems of interest , are characterized by such a complexity that it may make it unrealistic , at present , to predict the different aspects of their behavior by a precisely solvable model or numerical calculations .",
    "their complexity involves single - particle @xcite , many - body @xcite , and lattice effects @xcite , as well as the occurrence of nanoscale inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "even though approximate numerical calculations , and solutions of simple models , have been helpful @xcite , an approach incorporating results of different schemes may be necessary for the _ global _ understanding of the cuprates . in spite",
    "that a rigorous analytical or numerical solution of the incorporated scheme , in its globality , is beyond reach at present , it provides an insight to the understanding of the physics of the cuprates , which is missing when models which describe the system partially are applied .",
    "such an approach , including a minimal framework within which different aspects of the physics of the cuprates could be described correctly , has been worked out by the author @xcite . within this emerging ` global theory ' of the cuprates ( gtc ) their puzzling physics , including the occurrence of high-@xmath5 sc , can be understood as the result of a behavior typical of their structure within the regime of a mott transition @xcite .",
    "a solution has been studied , corresponding to a state where translational symmetry within the cuo@xmath1 planes is disturbed by dynamical stripe - like inhomogeneities .",
    "signatures of such inhomogeneities have been observed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs .",
    "they accommodate the competing effects of hopping and antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange on large-@xmath0 electrons , and their existence had been predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "these inhomogeneities provide quasi - one - dimensional segments in which the behavior of the electrons is described in terms of separate carriers of charge and spin @xcite .",
    "since these carriers are strongly coupled to electrons in the regions where spin and charge are inseparable , a two - component scenario is obtained of heavy and light charge carriers , coupled through spin carriers .",
    "the speed of the dynamics of the stripe - like inhomogeneities is self - consistently determined by the width of spin excitations around the af wave vector @xmath7 .",
    "small - width excitations , and slow dynamics , are obtained in the sc state , and to some degree in the pseudogap ( pg ) state @xcite .",
    "this theory was found to provide a highly - plausible explanation to _ all _ the anomalous properties of the cuprates that were studied by it .",
    "this includes the systematic anomalous behavior of the resistivity , hall constant , and thermoelectric power ( tep ) @xcite , and of spectroscopic anomalies @xcite . also were explained the low- and high - energy spin excitations around @xmath8 , including the neutron - resonance mode @xcite , and its connection to the peak - dip - hump structure observed in tunneling and arpes @xcite .",
    "pairing was shown @xcite to be induced by the energy gain due to the hopping of pair states perpendicular to the stripe - like inhomogeneities .",
    "pairing symmetry was predicted to be of the @xmath9 type , but to include features not characteristic of this symmetry @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the cuprates was found @xcite to result from an interplay between pairing and coherence within the regime of the mott transition .",
    "both pairing and coherence are necessary for sc to occur .",
    "coherence without pairing results in a metallic fermi - liquid ( fl ) state .",
    "incoherent pairing results in the pg state , consisting of electrons and localized electron pairs . at low temperatures ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the stripe - like inhomogeneities partially freeze in the pg state into a glassy `` checkerboard '' structure @xcite , and the electrons become localized .",
    "this results in the opening of localization minigaps on the fermi surface ( fs ) ; they contribute to the pg , and their size determines the lower doping limit of the sc phase . if sc is suppressed , the borderline between the fl and the pg states persists down to @xmath11 , where a metal - insulator - transition ( mit ) quantum critical point ( qcp ) occurs @xcite .",
    "a nanoscale heterogeneity was predicted @xcite , especially in the underdoped ( ud ) regime , consisting of `` perfectly '' sc regions which become completely paired for @xmath12 , and `` pg - like '' sc regions , where pairing remains partial as in the pg state .",
    "a distribution of such regions of different degrees of pairing has been observed by stm @xcite .",
    "this heterogeneity is expected to be intrinsic , and set in below @xmath5 even in very pure samples .",
    "its scale is larger than that of the dynamical stripe - like inhomogeneities , which are also intrinsic and essential for high-@xmath5 sc @xcite .",
    "injection of pairs , similar to the one occurring in p ",
    "n junctions in semiconductors , is expected in junctions including slices of a cuprate in the sc state and in the pg state , resulting in the observed `` giant proximity effect '' ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "similarly to transport , optical properties detect the electrons _ within _ the crystal , with no transfer of electrons into , or out of it ( as occurs _",
    "e.g. _ in tunneling or arpes ) .",
    "thus , even though their theoretical evaluation involves an integration over the brillouin zone ( bz ) , they still could be very sensitive to fine many - body effects .",
    "the relevance of optical results to the theoretical predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite has been mentioned there just in passing .",
    "here it is demonstrated how this gtc naturally explains a variety of optical results ( whichever were tested by it ) , detailed below , part of which have been lacking a satisfactory understanding so far .",
    "the partial glover ",
    "tinkham sum rule ( f  sum rule ) @xcite , over the conduction band , is studied .",
    "the gtc is applied to understand observed `` violations '' of the sum rule through @xmath5 , due to the transfer of spectral weight from energies @xmath13ev to the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath14 ) @xcite . also the optical signatures of @xmath6-axis collective modes @xcite are understood .    the physical interpretation of the optical density to mass ( @xmath2 ) ratio , derived , _",
    "e.g. _ , through the f - sum rule is clarified .",
    "the gtc is shown to explain `` tanner s law '' @xcite , under which the above ratio is about 45 times the contribution to it from the drude part of the optical conductivity @xmath15 , which happens to be just a little greater than the ratio @xmath16 based on the low-@xmath10 superfluid density @xmath17 .",
    "the approximate factor of four is connected to the periodicity within the stripe - like inhomogeneities .",
    "the increase in this factor in the heavily ud regime , as well as the occurrence of a constant effective mass of carriers through the transition to the af regime @xcite , are also understood .    the optical quantity @xmath18 is shown here to be _ not _ identical with the quantity obtained through the relation @xmath19 from measurements of the penetration - depth @xmath20 by methods like @xmath21 ( as has been observed @xcite ) , due to a difference between the many - body effects on them . in the second case",
    "the gtc predicts @xcite a boomerang - type behavior in the overdoped ( od ) regime , in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "but , as is shown here , no such behavior is expected for the optical @xmath22 , also in agreement with experiment @xcite .    within the gtc , the dynamical stripe - like inhomogeneities",
    "are intertwined with low - energy spin excitations around @xmath8 ( including the resonance mode ) , which contribute narrow peaks only in the pg and sc states .",
    "it is demonstrated here that their optical signatures have been observed @xcite in these states at energies on the edge of the gap , and within it .",
    "this theory is also shown to explain the different optical signatures of the pg in the @xmath6-direction and in the @xmath3-plane .",
    "namely the observation of a depression , within the pg energy range , of the optical conductivity @xmath23 , in the @xmath6-direction @xcite , but of the optical scattering rate @xmath24 in the @xmath3-plane @xcite .",
    "the sharp drop in this scattering rate below @xmath5 @xcite is also predicted by the gtc .",
    "the existence of the qcp in the phase diagram @xcite results in marginal - fermi - liquid ( mfl ) @xcite behavior of the scattering rate above @xmath5 , close to the qcp @xcite , and to critical behavior of optical quantities @xcite .",
    "`` uemura s law '' , under which @xmath25 in the ud regime @xcite , has been understood @xcite on the basis of the pairing phase `` stiffness '' @xcite .",
    "also the optically - derived `` homes law '' @xcite , under which @xmath26 , for cuprates in the entire doping ( @xmath27 ) regime , both in the @xmath3-plane , and in the @xmath6-direction , and also for low-@xmath5 sc s in the dirty limit , is shown to be consistent with the gtc .",
    "the validity of this law in the cuprates is related to the existence of quantum criticality there @xcite .",
    "even though homes law is an approximate one ( presented in a log  log scale ) , its coexistence with uemura s law in the ud regime implies that the dc conductivity at @xmath5 varies considerably less with @xmath27 ( in this regime ) than its variation at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "this behavior is predicted by the gtc as well , and also are understood apparent deviations from uemura s law in the heavily ud regime @xcite .",
    "_ ab - initio _ calculations @xcite in the cuprates indicate that the electrons in the vicinity of @xmath28 could be analyzed in terms of a band ( corresponding dominantly to copper and oxygen orbitals within the cuo@xmath1 planes ) for which large-@xmath0-limit approximations are adequate , which is somewhat hybridized to other bands for which small-@xmath0-limit approximations may be suitable .",
    "a perturbation expansion in @xmath0 is inadequate for the large-@xmath0 orbitals , and they are treated by the auxiliary - particles approach @xcite .",
    "thus , within the cuo@xmath1 planes , a large-@xmath0 electron in site @xmath29 and spin @xmath15 ( which is assigned numbers @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ) is created by @xmath33 , if it is in the `` upper - hubbard - band '' , and by @xmath34 , if it is in a zhang - rice - type `` lower - hubbard - band '' .    here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are creation operators of `` excessions '' and `` holons '' , and @xmath37 are creation operators of `` spinons '' .",
    "if either the excessions , or the holons are ignored , than the large-@xmath0 band could be treated within the @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 ( or @xmath38@xmath39@xmath41@xmath40 ) model .",
    "the auxiliary - particle approach is applied here using the `` slave fermion '' method @xcite , within which the holons / excessions are fermions and the spinons are bosons .",
    "this method had been successful treating antiferromagnetic ( af ) systems , and implies taking good account of the effect of af correlations . for rigorous treatment",
    ", one should in principle impose in each site the constraint : @xmath42 .    in order to treat this constraint properly , an auxiliary hilbert space is introduced within which a chemical - potential - like lagrange multiplier is used to impose the constraint on the average .",
    "but since the physical observables are projected into the physical space as combinations of green s functions , whose time evolution is determined by the hamiltonian which obeys the constraint rigorously , it is expected that it would not be violated as long as justifiable approximations were used .    the dynamics of the stripe - like inhomogeneities",
    "is approached adiabatically , treating them statically with respect to the electrons dynamics . the striped structure @xcite consists of narrow charged stripes forming antiphase domain walls between wider af stripes . since the spin - charge separation approximation ( under which two - auxiliary - particle spinon ",
    "holon / excession green s functions are decoupled into single - auxiliary - particle green s functions ) is valid in one - dimension , it is justified to assume the existence of effective spinless charge carriers within the narrow charged stripes , but not within the whole cuo@xmath1 plane ( as is assumed in rvb theory @xcite ) .",
    "the spinons are diagonalized by applying the bogoliubov transformation for bosons @xcite : @xmath43 spinon states , created by @xmath44 , have bare energies @xmath45 with a v - shape zero minimum at @xmath46 .",
    "bose condensation results in an af order of wave vector @xmath47 . within the lattice",
    "bz there are four inequivalent possibilities for @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 , thus introducing a broken symmetry .",
    "one has @xcite : @xmath51    holons ( excessions ) within the charged stripes are referred to as `` stripons '' ; they carry charge @xmath52 but no spin , and are created by fermion operators @xmath53 .",
    "a starting point of localized stripon states is assumed , due to the fatal effect of imperfections in the striped structure on itineracy in one dimension .",
    "this assumption is supported by the atomic - scale structure observed recently by stm @xcite , which is consistent with a fluctuating domino - type two - dimensional arrangement of stripe - like inhomogeneities .",
    "such a two - dimensional arrangement has been predicted by the author @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 wave vectors of the stripon states present @xmath54-symmetrized combinations of localized states to be treated in a perturbation expansion when coupling to the other fields is considered .",
    "away from the charged stripes , creation operators of approximate fermion basis states of spinon  holon and spinon  excession pairs are constructed @xcite . together with the small-@xmath0 states they form , within the auxiliary space , a basis to `` quasi - electron '' ( qe ) states , carrying charge @xmath52 and spin @xmath55 , and created by @xmath56 . the bare qe energies @xmath57 form quasi - continuous ranges of bands within the bz .",
    "atomic doping in the cuprates is taking place in inter - planar layers ( such as in the chains in ybco ) between cuo@xmath1 planes , and orbitals of the doped atoms contribute states close to @xmath28 .",
    "these states hybridize with the qe bands , and provide charge transfer to the planes with doping .",
    "the qe bands are spanned between the upper and lower hubbard bands and the vicinity of @xmath28 , with more holon - based states closer to the lower hubbard band ( relevant mainly for `` p - type '' cuprates ) , and more excession - based states closer to the upper hubbard band ( relevant mainly for `` n - type '' cuprates ) .",
    "as the doping level @xmath27 is increasing , more qe states are moving from the hubbard bands to the vicinity of @xmath28 , and the system is moving from the insulating to the metallic side of the mott transition regime .",
    "as was mentioned above , the treatment of the constraint , within the auxiliary space , introduces an additional chemical - potential - like lagrange multiplier .",
    "since the stripons carry only charge , while the qe s carry both charge and spin , their treatment involves two `` chemical potentials '' , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( corresponding to qe s and stripons , respectively ) whose values are determined by the correct charge , and averaged constraint .",
    "hopping and hybridization terms introduce strong coupling between the qe , stripon , and spinon fields , which is expressed by a hamiltonian term of the form ( for p - type cuprates ) : @xmath60 + h.c .",

    "the stripe - like inhomogeneities are strongly coupled to the lattice @xcite , and it is the presence of stripons which creates the charged stripes within them . also the matrix elements in @xmath61 , are sensitive to the atomic positions @xcite .",
    "consequently @xcite , the spinons are renormalized , being `` dressed '' by phonons , and thus carry some lattice distortion ( but no charge ) in addition to spin @xmath55 .",
    "such phonon - dressed spinons are referred to as `` svivons '' , and they replace the spinons in the @xmath61 vertex .",
    "this results in strong coupling between electronic spin excitations and cu  o optical phonon modes @xcite , and the existence of an anomalous isotope effect @xcite .",
    "the effect of spin - lattice coupling has been studied by eremin _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "plane.,width=312 ]    the physical signature of the auxiliary fields , considering only the large-@xmath0 band , within the @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 model , is demonstrated in fig .  1",
    ". an adiabatic `` snapshot '' of a section of a cuo@xmath1 plane , including a stripe - like inhomogeneity , is shown . within the adiabatic time scale",
    "a site is `` spinless '' either if it is `` charged '' , removing the spinned electron / hole on it ( as in `` stripon sites '' in fig .  1 ) , or if the spin is fluctuating on a shorter time scale ( due to , _ e.g. _ , being in a singlet spin pair ) .",
    "in this description , a site ( bare ) stripon excitation represents a transition between these two types of a spinless site within the charged stripes , a site ( bare ) svivon excitation represents a transition between a spinned site and a fluctuating - spin spinless site , and a site ( bare ) qe excitation represents a transition between a spinned site and a charged spinless site within the af stripes .",
    "the @xmath62 vertex introduces self - energy corrections to the qe , stripon , and svivon fields @xcite .",
    "since the renormalized stripon bandwidth is considerably smaller than the qe and svivon bandwidths , a phase - space argument could be used , as in the migdal theorem , to ignore vertex corrections .",
    "self - consistent expressions were derived @xcite for the self - energy corrections , and spectral functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , for the qe , stripon , and svivon fields , respectively . the auxiliary - particle energies @xmath66 are renormalized to : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the self energy . due to the quasi - continuous range of qe bands ,",
    "the bandwidth renormalization is particularly strong for the stripon energies , resulting in a very small bandwidth , and limited itineracy due to hopping via intermediary qe",
    " svivon states .",
    "the small stripon bandwidth introduces @xcite a low - energy scale of @xmath69ev , and an apparent `` zero - energy '' non - analytic behavior of the qe and svivon self energies within a higher energy range ( analyticity is restored in the low - energy range ) .",
    "this behavior results in qe and svivon scattering rates with a term @xmath70 , as in the mfl approach @xcite , but also with a constant term , resulting in a logarithmic singularity in @xmath71 at @xmath72 ( which is truncated by analyticity in the low - energy range ) .",
    "consequently the qe self - energy has a kink - like behavior of the renormalized qe energies @xmath73 around zero energy @xcite .",
    "a typical renormalization of the svivon energies , around the v - shape zero minimum of @xmath74 at @xmath48 , is shown in fig .  2 , where the major effect is due to the truncated logarithmic singularity in the svivon self energy . the svivon spectral functions @xmath75 vary continuously around @xmath72 , being positive for @xmath76 and negative for @xmath77 .",
    ".,width=312 ]    the renormalization of the svivon energies changes the physical signature of their bose condensation from an af order to the observed stripe - like inhomogeneities ( including both their spin and lattice aspects ) .",
    "the structure of @xmath65 and @xmath78 around the minimum at @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) determines the structure of the inhomogeneities .",
    "striped structure of the type shown in fig .  1 results from a direction - dependent slope of @xmath79 at small negative energies .",
    "the speed of the dynamics of these inhomogeneities depends on the linewidth of @xmath78 at small negative energies , which is large , unless the system is in a pairing state ( thus the sc or pg state ) , where svivon scattering at such energies is suppressed due to the gap @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of the stripe - like inhomogeneities becomes sufficiently slow for them to be detected only in a pairing state , in agreement with experiment .",
    "for the renormalized svivons , @xmath80 and @xmath81 do not diverge at @xmath48 , as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . but",
    "still the values of both of them are large in the negative-@xmath79 region around this point ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and thus this region contributes significantly to processes involving svivons . by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the coupling between qe s , stripons , and svivons of this region , are particularly strong when @xmath82 . on the other hand , a relatively smaller contribution is obtained to such processes from the positive-@xmath79 regions , especially when they are sufficiently away from @xmath48 , where by eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "since the stripons are based on states in the charged stripe - like inhomogeneities , which occupy about a quarter of the cuo@xmath1 plane @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) , the number of stripon states is about a quarter of the number of states in the bz .",
    "the @xmath54 values mostly contributing to these states reflect , on one hand , the structure of the stripe - like inhomogeneities , and on the other hand , the minimization of free energy , achieved when they reside mainly at bz areas where their coupling to the qe s and svivons , is optimal .",
    "this occurs @xcite for stripon coupling with svivons around @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and with qe s at bz areas of highest density of states ( dos ) close to @xmath28 , which are found in most of the cuprates around the `` antinodal '' points @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "if ( from its four possibilities ) @xmath48 were chosen at @xmath87 , then the bz areas in those cuprates , which the @xmath54 values contributing to the stripon states mostly come from , would be @xcite at about a quarter of the bz around @xmath88 .",
    "creation operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 of stripon states , which are an even and an odd combination of states at @xmath91 and @xmath92 , were demonstrated @xcite to be compatible with the striped structure shown in fig .  1 , in areas where the stripes are directed along either the @xmath93 or the @xmath94 direction .",
    "the electronic structure obtained here for the cuprates provides a hopping - energy - driven pairing mechanism .",
    "diagrams for such pairing , based on transitions between pair states of stripons and qe s , through the exchange of svivons , were presented in ref .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite , within the @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 model , that there is an energy gain in inter - stripe hopping of pairs of neighboring stripons through intermediary states of pairs of opposite - spin qe s ( where a svivon is exchanged when one pair is switched to the other ) , compared to the hopping of two uncorrelated stripons , through intermediary qe  svivon states ( since the intermediary svivon excitations are avoided ) .",
    "the contribution of orbitals beyond the @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 model to the qe states results in further gain in stripon pairing energy , due to both intra - plane and inter - plane pair hopping .",
    "this pairing scheme provides eliasherg - type equations , of coupled stripon and qe pairing order parameters , which can be combined to give bcs - like equations ( though including strong - coupling effects ) for both of them in the second order @xcite . to study these equations , a domino - type two - dimensional arrangement of stripe - like inhomogeneities , including crossover between stripe segments directed in the @xmath93 and the @xmath94 directions ,",
    "was assumed @xcite , and found later to be consistent with stm results @xcite .",
    "an overall @xmath9-type pairing symmetry was obtained @xcite , under which pair correlations are maximal between opposite - spin nearest - neighbor qe sites , and vanish between same - spin next - nearest - neighbor qe sites ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "sign reversal is obtained @xcite for the qe order parameter through the charged stripes .",
    "thus , the lack of long - range coherence in the details of the stripe - like inhomogeneities , especially between different cuo@xmath1 planes , results in features different from those of a simple @xmath9-wave pairing ( especially when @xmath6-direction hopping is involved ) , as has been observed @xcite .      within the gtc @xcite , the phase diagram of the cuprates is largely the consequence of interplay between pairing and coherence within the regime of a mott transition .",
    "the pairing mechanism , which depends on the stripe - like inhomogeneities , is stronger when the af / stripes effects are stronger , thus closer to the insulating side of the mott transition regime .",
    "consequently , the temperature @xmath95 , below which pairing occurs , decreases with the doping level @xmath27 , as is sketched in the pairing line in fig .",
    "3 . on the other hand , phase coherence ,",
    "be it of single electrons or of pairs , requires the energetic advantage of itineracy around @xmath28 , which is easier to achieve closer to the metallic side of the mott transition regime .",
    "thus the temperature @xmath96 , below which coherence occurs , increases with @xmath27 , as is sketched in the coherence line in fig .  3 .",

    "( 3 ) , let us write it as : @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the average number of pairs in the volume of a slice of thickness @xmath109 around a plane parallel to the cuo@xmath1 planes ( assumed to be squares of length @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 is a pair s mass , and @xmath112 is the closest wave - vector point ( within a plane ) to the pairs @xmath113 ground - state point .",
    "thus the phase stiffness is related to the energy needed ( due to lattice discreteness ) to excite a macroscopic number of pairs from the single - pair ground state to the first excited state .",
    "thus , in the pg state , single - pair states are occupied ( though _ not _ macroscopically ) up to energies @xmath114 ( which are a considerable fraction of the pairs bandwidth ) .",
    "consequently moderate interactions , mixing between @xmath115 pair states ( such as induced by phonons ) , are likely to mix them , resulting in bipolaron - like localized pair states .    the application of a compressive strain , in this regime , results in the increase of @xmath116 , and thus also of @xmath96 and @xmath5 [ see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] . and",
    "indeed , arpes results in lsco thin films @xcite show that @xmath5 rises under such a strain . as was discussed above",
    ", the increase in @xmath96 is consistent with a move towards the metallic side of the mott transition regime , which is reflected in the increase of the width of the bands around @xmath28 under this strain @xcite .    when a junction is made , including slices of a cuprate in the sc state and in the pg state , an injection of pairs is expected to occur between them , as in p ",
    "n junctions in semiconductors .",
    "consequently , the density of pairs in a range within the pg side of the junction could exceed the phase - stiffness limit of eq .",

    "this explains the observation of a gpe in trilayer junctions of cuprate thin films @xcite , oriented both in the @xmath3 plane , and in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "unlike the regular proximity effect , where the range is determined by the coherence length , the range of the gpe is determined by the range where injection of carriers between the sc and pg slices occurs .",
    "this range is not related to the coherence length , and could be larger by more than an order of magnitude from it , as is observed @xcite .      in order to understand the natures of the sc and pg states , let us regard the qe and stripon ( bogoliubov ) energy bands obtained through their bcs - like equations @xcite : @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 are related to the observed pairing gap @xcite , as will be discussed below .",

    "since the stripons reside in about a quarter of the bz around @xmath123 , @xmath124 does not vary much from its mean value @xmath125 , and an @xmath126-wave pairing factor is relevant for it .",
    "thus , at low @xmath10 : @xmath127    the stripon bandwidth @xmath128 has been estimated from tep results @xcite ( see below ) to be @xmath69ev , and by the measured @xmath100 ( see fig .  3 ) and the above expression",

    "thus the pg state consists of _ both _ paired and unpaired stripons .",
    "since an sc ground state is normally characterized by complete pairing for @xmath133 , an _ intrinsically _ heterogenous sc state is obtained there @xcite , with nanoscale perfectly sc regions , where , locally , @xmath134 , and partial - pairing pg - like regions , where @xmath131 locally , but sc still occurs in proximity to the @xmath135 regions .",

    "the degeneracy of the paired states in a perfectly sc state is maintained by the dynamics of the stripe - like inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "thus the free - energy gain in this state keeps them dynamical to @xmath12 .",
    "this is not the case in the pg state ( and also within pg - like regions in an heterogenous sc state ) , where these inhomogeneities partially freeze at low @xmath10 into a glassy checkerboard structure @xcite . within this structure",

    "energy is gained by creating partial or complete minigaps for the unpaired carriers ( which may result in an additional superstructure @xcite ) ; but even if there is no real gap within the whole bz , the unpaired carriers would become anderson - localized due to their low dos in the low-@xmath10 disordered glassy structure . and",
    "indeed , low-@xmath10 upturns are observed in the electrical resistivity in the pg states , either for low @xmath27 , or if the sc state is suppressed , for @xmath103 , by applying a magnetic field @xcite , or by doping @xcite .",
    "when such a suppression occurs , the pairing and coherence lines ( see fig",

    "the heterogeneous existence , in an sc state , of perfectly sc and pg - like partial - pairing regions , discussed above , has been observed by stm @xcite through the distribution in the heights and widths of the gap - edge peak ( widened due to scattering of svivons to unpaired stripons and qe s ) .",
    "these stm results also show @xcite that , unlike the gap - edge peak , the low energy excitations near the sc gap minimum are not affected by this heterogeneity .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction @xcite [ see eq .",
    "( 8) ] that the sc gap is determined , around its zeroes at the nodal points , by the qe gap @xmath121 .",
    "the magnitudes of the qe energies @xmath154 around the nodal points , are _ below _ the range of @xmath161 , and convoluted stripon  svivon states , which may hybridize with them , correspond to svivons which are _ not _ at the vicinity of @xmath48 , and to energies @xmath162 of magnitudes _ above _ @xmath161 .",
    "thus the hybridization between them is insignificant ( see fig .  2 and the discussion following it ) , and the linewidths of the qe states around the nodal points are small in the sc state , and do _ not _ vary between the perfectly sc and pg - like regions , as the gap - edge states do .",
    "as was mentioned above , the formation of the glassy ( checkerboard ) structure in the pg state , and the pg - like sc regions , is self - consistently intertwined with the formation of ( at least partial ) minigaps and the localization of the unpaired stripons .",

    "qe states are extended over a larger range in space than the size of the sc regions , and those with the above localization gaps can participate in the pairing process only if these gaps are ( approximately ) smaller than their pairing gaps .",
    "since the qe bandwidth is much larger than @xmath163 [ see eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] , they become almost completely paired at low @xmath10 ( also in the pg state ) , except for the qe states which have too big localization gaps to participate in the pairing process , and those at the vicinity of the nodal points . the minimal doping level @xmath164 @xcite , for which sc pairing occurs , is determined by the condition that for @xmath165 the number of qe states , which have sufficiently small localization gaps to be coupled to stripon states in the pairing process @xcite , drops below the minimum necessary for the pairing to occur .",
    "consequently , arpes measurements in the sc as well as the pg state @xcite , show that parts of fs around the antinodal points disappear , due to the formation of the qe gap ( including parts which are due to localization , and parts which are due to pairing ) . on the other hand , arcs of the fs",
    "remain around the zero-@xmath121 nodal points , where unpaired qe states persist at low @xmath10 , and become localized for @xmath12 .",
    "such arcs continue to exist also for @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath166 regime is characterized by `` diagonal stripes '' , where the stripon states do not contribute at @xmath28 @xcite , and transport is due to the qe s on the nodal arcs ( with the rest of the fs missing ) .",
    "the modulation caused by the diagonal stripes , in a direction perpendicular to them , could be the reason for the minigap observed @xcite by arpes in the nodal direction in this regime .",
    "resistivity ( @xmath167 ) measurements through @xmath168 @xcite confirm the low-@xmath10 localization on the nodal fs arcs ( whether it is anderson localization , or due to a minigap ) , and show a monotonous variation of @xmath169 with @xmath27 , which is not affected ( except for the occurrence of sc ) by the change in the striped structure or the af transition .",
    "this indicates that the qe s on the nodal fs arcs are hardly affected by the change in the striped structure .",
    "their hopping is likely to be dominated by @xmath39 processes @xcite , which do not disturb the af order .",

    "there are two possible mechanisms ( or their combination ) for an accompanying transfer of spectral weight from the hubbard bands to the vicinity of @xmath28 , both driven by the free energy gain in the sc state .",
    "the first one is that this transfer of spectral weight is associated with the increased itineracy of the pairs in the superfluid .",

    "( 4 ) ] , obeys approximately ( thus when presented on a log  log scale ) the relation @xmath423 ( both sides in the equation possess the same units ) .",
    "this relation , known as homes law , is obeyed in the cuprates in almost the entire doping regime , both in the @xmath3-plane , and in the @xmath6-direction , and in other sc s which behave according to dirty - limit approximations . in a subsequent paper , homes _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that this law should be valid in the dirty - limit , and in the intermediate - scattering regime , when it applies to transport in the _",
    "normal state_. the reason is that the @xmath424 spectral weight , which condenses into the superfluid @xmath292-funcion term in @xmath23 , approximately scales then as the product of @xmath425 and the sc gap , which approximately scales as @xmath5 .",
    "thus , in the regime of validity of homes law , it could be expressed as : @xmath426    as was discussed above , @xmath367 in the cuprates corresponds to the intermediate - scattering regime in the normal state , with most of the drude carriers turning into a superfluid .",
    "but the drop in @xmath427 below @xmath5 ( seen in fig .  6 ) , predicted by the gtc , turns them into clean - limit sc s .",
    "the @xmath6-direction conductivity was discussed above as being described by the dirty - limit both above and below @xmath5 , and also through the josephson tunneling scenario , which was shown @xcite to result in eq .",
    "( 28 ) too .",
    "thus , the gtc is consistent with the applicability of homes law in the cuprates , both in the @xmath3-plane , and the @xmath6-direction , and it could be expressed there as : @xmath428    this expression is the consequence of the mfl behavior @xcite , due to quantum criticality , and thus @xcite the existence of one energy scale , which is the temperature . the coexistence of homes law with uemura s law [ see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ] in the ud regime implies , by eq .  ( 28 ) , that @xmath425 does not vary much with @xmath27 there ( in agreement with experiment @xcite , except when localization starts above @xmath5 ) , which was shown above to be the consequence of the decrease in @xmath412 [ and by eq .",
    "( 30 ) , also in @xmath5 ] in the pg state .",
    "( 30 ) connects high @xmath5 in the cuprates with a high scattering rate , which lead also to an mit .",
    "the existence of sc close to the boundary of mit s has been pointed out by osofsky _",
    "zaanen @xcite suggested that homes law implies that @xmath5 in the cuprates is determined , approximately by the condition that the scattering rate in the normal state is becoming at @xmath5 as high as is permitted by the laws of quantum physics .",
    "here it was shown that the high scattering rate is strongly decreased below @xmath5 , since it is determined by the same interactions which determine pairing .",
    "the success of the gtc in providing the understanding of a variety of puzzling optical properties of the cuprates , in addition to its earlier success in explaining many other anomalous properties of these materials , strengthens the point of view that the occurrence of high-@xmath5 sc in them requires the proximity of a mott transition .",
    "it suggests the occurrence of spin - charge separation in the cuprates @xcite , _ but _ only due to the existence of dynamical inhomogeneities , which provide quasi - one - dimensional structures .",
    "it also predicts an intrinsic origin to the static nanoscale heterogeneity observed in the ud regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gtc supports the opinion that the same interactions which play a major role in the determination of the electronic structure of the cuprates , also primarily determine pairing , transport , and other anomalous properties in them .    even though a complete rigorous first - principles proof on the validity of the gtc is still beyond reach , due to the complexity of the global scheme , and many of its results",
    "are still obtained on a qualitative level , the mounting evidence on the global scope of its applicability points very strongly to its validity for the cuprates .",

    "<S> a theory has been worked out for the cuprates , which is based on the major features of their first - principles - derived electronic structure , including the contribution of a large-@xmath0 band . within this theory the puzzling physics of the cuprates </S>",
    "<S> is shown to be a behavior specific of their structure , within the regime of a mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> the translational symmetry within the cuo@xmath1 planes is disturbed by dynamical stripe - like inhomogeneities , which provide quasi - one - dimensional segments where the large-@xmath0 scenario of separation between spin and charge is materialized . however , these charge carriers gain itineracy only due to the coupling with electrons in the regions where spin and charge are inseparable . consequently a two - component scenario is obtained of heavy and light charge carriers , which are coupled through spin carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the theory could explain all the anomalous properties of the cuprates that were studied by it , including those observed in transport , tunneling , arpes , and neutron - scattering results , the pairing mechanism and its symmetry , the observed phase diagram , and the occurrence of intrinsic nanoscale heterogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> here this theory is applied to study a variety of puzzling optical properties of the cuprates , and again provides a natural explanation , for each property tested . </S>",
    "<S> this includes `` violations '' of the f  sum rule , tanner s law , homes law , uemura s law , the behavior of the @xmath2 ratio with doping , the behavior in the heavily underdoped and overdoped regimes , states within the gap and on its edge , the drop in the @xmath3-plane scattering rate below @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the gap - like behavior of the @xmath6-direction optical conductivity below @xmath4 , and @xmath6-direction collective modes .    # </S>",
