    "the wenchuan earthquake of may 12 , 2008 occurred in the sichuan province of the people s republic of china . this m7.9 event ruptured along the border of the longmen",
    "shan margin of the tibetan plateau in the west and the sichuan basin in the east .",
    "the earthquake s nucleation point was at long=103.364 and lat=30.986 at about 16 km depth .",
    "the epicentral error is 5 km and the focal depth estimation error is 10 to 15 km @xcite .    the beichuan fault system , consisting of listric and nnw dipping reverse faults , broke 250 - 300 km parallel along the longmen shan thrust belt ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .",
    "this intra - continental region has been extensively studied both prior to and after the m7.9 earthquake in 2008 , including a ) paleo - seismicity studies @xcite , b ) instrumental recordings of the seismicity prior to and after the mainshock ( 1970 - 2009 ) @xcite , c ) inversion data analyses of teleseismic body waves of the mainshock @xcite , d ) studies on coseismic ground deformations @xcite . finally , the trigger mechanism of the 2008 m7.9 wenchuan earthquake has been debated since the earthquake s occurrence @xcite .",
    "some studies suggest that the mainshock might have been triggered by pore pressure diffusion within the earth s crust resulting from a nearby artificial lake , the zipingpu water reservoir @xcite .",
    "other studies reject the hypothesis of triggering due to pore pressure diffusion @xcite .",
    "it can be anticipated that the earthquake cycle was already in its late stage in 2005 and close to failure conditions , because the wenchuan earthquake ruptured in 2008 .",
    "but , did the surface loading affect the earthquake cycle and the initial rupture ?",
    "how many years of equivalent tectonic loading would the artificial loading advance the clock of the mainshock and how much of the coseismic slip would it produce ?",
    "this study shows that observations and data modeling support the initial argument that lithostatic stress changes and the poroelastic response of the earth s crust due to the weight of the zipingpu reservoir on the earth s crust most likely triggered the 2008 m7.9 wenchuan earthquake @xcite .",
    "the article provides further evidence that a ) surface loading due to water mass accumulations within the zipingpu water reservoir in the minjiang river valley between 2005 and 2008 induced coulomb failure stress changes in the earth s crust and b ) triggering stress perturbations beneath the artificial lake likely advanced the clock of the wenchuan earthquake , while affecting the initial rupture propagation .",
    "furthermore , the water reservoir impounding generated static triggering stress perturbations in the earth s crust beginning in 2005 that biased daily stress alterations due to tidal elongations of the moon and the sun .",
    "furthermore , it could have changed the natural earthquake cycle and advanced the clock of the 2008 wenchuan earthquake by several decades .",
    "instrumentally recorded seismicity with magnitudes up to 5.0 was observed in this region before 2004 @xcite .",
    "paleoseismic studies also show evidence of quaternary reverse faulting in the longmen shan region .",
    "radiocarbon analyses ( @xmath6c ) , for example , indicate that the last major earthquake ( m@xmath07.9 ) might have occurred between 4 and 10kyr ago @xcite . moreover , deformation measurements suggest the longmen shan is a transition part between both a stable continental region ( sichuan basin ) with strain rates @xmath7yr@xmath8 and an active continental region ( tibet plateau ) with strain rates @xmath9yr@xmath8 .    the area where the mainshock nucleated tends to have low horizontal and vertical tectonic deformation rates of @xmath101.0@xmath11.0 mm yr@xmath8 , resulting in less seismic activities when compared to a ) the seismic hazard regions in the quiangtan block ( southwest ) and the kulun mountains ( northwest ) and b ) the mesozoic deformation period @xcite .",
    "high shear - wave velocity structures and bouguer - gravity structures indicate a mechanically strong mid crust ( 10 - 20 km ) and a cratonic - like lithosphere of the sichuan basin ( fig .",
    "1a ) , in particular , in the yangtze block along the sw longmen shan at the border to the songpan - garze block @xcite .",
    "yao et al .  suggested a more unstable lower part of the crust ( @xmath420 km ) along the longmen shan which could be explained by low shear - wave velocity structures @xcite .      between october 2005 and may 2008 shallow seismicity patterns ( @xmath010 km )",
    "were observed on the beichuan fault system along a @xmath1020 km long part of the lower minjiang river valley parallel to the extension of the zipingpu water reservoir @xcite .",
    "such shallow seismicity could be indicative for earthquakes in a stable continental crust @xcite .",
    "however , lei et al . , reported that the seismicity change might be associated with a continuous water accumulation by the zipingpu dam in the minjiang river valley almost three years prior to the rupture of the mainshock @xcite . at the northern end of the valley ,",
    "the minjiang river flows into the chengdu plain of the sichuan basin .",
    "the artificial water reservoir extended sub - parallel to the beichuan fault segment bt1 about 1.5 km westward and bt2 less than 1.0 km eastward ( figs .  2 and 1 ) .",
    "after continuous impounding , the water level peaked twice in october 2006 and october 2007 at water reservoir capacity of 1.10 10@xmath11m@xmath12 ( upper water level ) which is equivalent to a mass of 1.10 billion metric tonnes ( gt ) . between october 2007 and may 12 2008",
    "the reservoir was , again , seasonally drained to a remaining volume of 0.32 10@xmath11m@xmath12 ( lower water level ) .",
    "lei et al .  first mentioned that the seismic events of magnitudes ranging between 0.5 and 3.9 might have illuminated a destabilization process on bt during the loading period of the water reservoir .",
    "prior to the surface loading , the correlation coefficient between the water level and the daily event rate ( 383 days ) is -0.18 ( fig .  3 ) . since may 2005 - the start of the flooding season - a positive correlation exists between the water level ( mass of water ) and the micro - seismicity beneath the water reservoir . with a coefficient of 0.69 , the correlation is strongest between 2005 and 2006 during the first 366 days of loading . between 2006 and 2007",
    "the correlation is weaker with a coefficient of 0.62 .",
    "thus , it could be anticipated that the earthquake nucleation processes started already in 2006 .",
    "numerical inversion data of teleseismic body waves ( p - waves ) show that the mainshock described a complex rupture process on the beichuan fault segment bt1 ( fig .",
    "1b ) @xcite . during the first 15 - 20 seconds ,",
    "a reverse fault focal mechanism dominated at and above the nucleation point of the mainshock @xcite .",
    "the rupture propagated with a coseismic slip of up to 4 m on bt1 upwards toward the minjiang river valley .",
    "thus , it propagated directly to the surface loading area of the zipingpu water reservoir .",
    "after 20 seconds , the rupture propagation process changed to a right - lateral nne strike - slip mechanism ne of the minjiang river valley @xcite .",
    "an exact first order solution of stress states below the surface loading area ( lower and upper water reservoir ) in the minjiang river valley ( fig .",
    "2 ) is according to boussinesq s classical solution @xcite .",
    "boussinesq s solution for point loads is based on the assumption that the modulus of elasticity is constant within a homogeneous 3-dimensional half - space ( earth s crust ) .",
    "moreover , the principle of linear superposition is also assumed to be valid .",
    "for the given problem , surface areas of the lower and upper water level with arbitrary geometry were discretized in @xmath13 @xmath14 m@xmath2 elements ( e.g. , 50@xmath1550 m@xmath2 ) . with respect to the surface elements ,",
    "a.  love developed a method to analytically determine stress states at a depth @xmath16 beneath any uniform un / load @xmath17 with the area @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this analytical solution is free of any elastic constant and can be defined for each 2-d surface element @xmath19 :    @xmath20    @xmath21,\\ ] ]    and where @xmath22 is the mass change and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 describes the fraction of @xmath17 in the vicinity beneath @xmath25 and ranges between 0 and 1 .",
    "the un / loads @xmath17 induce a positive / negative vertical stress alteration @xmath26 superimposed over all @xmath27 , whereas @xmath28 0 is compression . @xmath29",
    "also changes the horizontal stress components , due to the elastic response of the crust ( hook s law ) : @xmath26 and @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 is the poisson s ratio .",
    "it is likely that @xmath32 , because horizontal principal strains @xmath33 are very small and can be assumed to be @xmath34 in 11 - 19 km depth , where faults are generally locked in the longmen shan region @xcite .",
    "table [ modelquantities ] shows the 3-dimensional model quantities that were taken into account to determine the lithostatic stress perturbations in the earth s crust .",
    "stress states were determined on 7@xmath154 km@xmath2 large fault elements of the double - listric beichuan fault system ( bt1,2 , and 3 ) near the artificial reservoir in the minjiang river valley .",
    "thus , @xmath27 and the resulting static coulomb failure stress @xmath35 :    @xmath36    were calculated on each fault element with respect to the lower and upper water level in the minjiang river valley ( fig .",
    "2 ) , whereby @xmath37 is the effective normal stress .",
    "@xmath35-values were used for further estimations of the clock advancements @xmath38 with respect to 4 kyr , 7 kyr , and 10 kyr earthquake cycles of the fault system ( this methodology is described the next section ) .",
    "pore - pressure diffusion most likely played a major role for the micro - seismicity ( m@xmath04 ) that was observed beneath the water reservoir , according to the study of lei et al .",
    "thus , drained conditions might have existed in shallower depth ( @xmath010 km ) in the paleozoic rocks and the permeable mesozoic rocks .",
    "this suggests that the poroelastic response due to the lithostatic stress alterations of the surface loading played a minor role under these geological conditions .",
    "thus , the skempton coefficient @xmath39 was assumed to lie between 0.5 and 0.7 @xcite .",
    "@xmath40    where @xmath41 is the change of the mean stress .    in undrained conditions ( @xmath410 km ) the pore pressure @xmath42 increased due to the poroelastic effects and destabilized bt1 and bt2 within the low permeable proterozoic granitic rocks .",
    "the poroelastic response tends to increase with both depth ( confining pressure ) and fracture density @xcite .",
    "the skempton coefficient @xmath39 , which describes the strength of the poroelastic response , was assumed to range between 0.7 and 0.8 in 10 - 23 km depth .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath39 is additionally amplified up to 0.85 , due to a higher fracture density @xcite near the intersection regions of bt1 and bt2 in 15 - 17 km and at the south end of bt1 in direction to the intersection with the wenchuan maowen thrust fault wmt ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the mohr - coulomb failure criteria indicates that the poroelastic response dominated only on steep dipping fault segments ( @xmath460@xmath43 ) .",
    "geomechanical parameters , which were used to determine triggering stress perturbations , are summarized in table [ modelquantities ] .",
    ".model quantities for determining the coulomb failure stress on the beichuan fault system due to the surface loading in the minjiang river valley ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ model - results ]",
    "this study suggests that surface loading of at least 320 million metric tons of water , which accumulated in the zipingpu water reservoir in the minjiang river valley between 2005 and 2008 , most likely triggered advanced china s wenchuan m7.9 earthquake of may 12 , 2008 , while enhancing a reverse - fault rupture propagation within the first 20 seconds .",
    "specifically , 3-dimensional geomechanical modeling results based on a rate - and - state dependent friction law show that static triggering stresses brought parts of the benchuan thrust fault system nearby the water reservoir closer to failure and advanced the clock of the mainshock by up to six decades .",
    "conversely , other fault segments , directly beneath the reservoir , were brought away from failure due to the weight of the reservoir .",
    "the estimated slip of equivalent tectonic loading that was produced by the water reservoir on the beichuan fault system indicates a strong correlation with the observed coseismic slip during the mainshock of may 12 , 2008 .",
    "the highest correlation coefficient of 0.93 was found for an earthquake cycle of 10 kyr .",
    "moreover , correlations become weaker with decreasing recurrence time of the earthquake cycle .",
    "this confirms results of previous paleoseismicity studies , which show evidence that the longmen shan and , in particular , the pengguan massif is characterized by a @xmath47 kyr seismic cycle for major m@xmath47 earthquakes .",
    "the author is grateful to think geohazards for its generous financial support .",
    "he also thanks the five anonymous reviewers for their constructive critiques and c.h .",
    "scholz and l.  seeber from lamont - doherty earth observatory for their suggestions and comments to improve this manuscript .",
    "everyday , the moon and sun cause tidal elongations on earth @xcite .",
    "these daily pull / push effects , in turn , induce stabilizing and destabilizing stresses on preexisting fault zones in the earth s crust and are independent from any geological forces on earth , including endogenous forces ( e.g. , volcanism , tectonics ) and exogenous forces ( e.g. , erosion , sedimentation ) .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that tidal stress changes have weak effects on triggering medium- to large - size earthquakes @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be anticipated that any triggering stress perturbation on the earth s crust must exceed at least stress levels resulting from the tidal elongation of the earth .",
    "analytically , it can be shown how high these tidal stress changes are .",
    "let s assume , @xmath44 is the earth s gravitational potential , which results from both attraction force and centrifugal force of the earth and moon / sun .",
    "tidal forces @xmath45 , however , deform @xmath44 :              with the lunar tidal constant @xmath52 = 2.6206 m@xmath2s@xmath53 and the solar tidal constant @xmath54 = 1.2068 m@xmath2s@xmath53 , the radius of the earth @xmath55 and the mean radius of the earth @xmath56 = 6371.221 km . assuming the earth is a sphere ( @xmath55 = @xmath56 ) , the general form of vertical surface displacement is          thus , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 are amplified at the zenith ( @xmath50 = 0@xmath43 ) by 0.356 m and 0.164 m. on the other hand , they are depressed at the nadir ( @xmath50 = 90@xmath43 ) by 0.178 m and 0.082 m. the peak - trough difference for the moon is 0.534 m and 0.246 m for the sun .",
    "both vertical displacements induce maximal shear stresses @xmath61 and normal stresses @xmath62 on preexisting faults ( e.g. , dipping 45@xmath43 ) in the earth s crust with an average shear modulus of about @xmath63 = 30 gpa and friction angle of , let s assume , @xmath64 of 29@xmath43 :                          burchfiel , b.c .",
