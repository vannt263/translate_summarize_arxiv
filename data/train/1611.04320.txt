    "stable distributions ( also called _ lvy distributions _ ) , belong to the most important classes among probability distributions with many applications .",
    "they have been firstly investigated by gnedenko and kolmogorov @xcite as limiting distributions of sums of i.i.d .",
    "random variables . as a consequence ,",
    "they are form - invariant under the operation of convolution .",
    "therefore , they serve as approximating distributions in many systems , where the temporal correlations are not so strong .",
    "these include evolutionary programming  @xcite , complex systems  @xcite or stochastic processes  @xcite .",
    "one of the important applications can be found in financial modelling . since the pioneering works of mandelbrot and fama in the 1960s @xcite , stable distributions are known to play an important role in realistic financial market modeling , notably because they allow the market prices to jump at any time at any value , which is caused by the power - law decay in tails parts .",
    "the events are sometimes called black - swan events , after a popular book by n.  n.  taleb  @xcite . during the past few years",
    "it has become more and more obvious that such dramatic drops occurred more often that predicted by gaussian models , demonstrating even more clearly the pertinence of @xmath0-stable modeling in option pricing theory @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there have been introduced several other sophisticated models including truncated lvy distributions  @xcite , multifractal volatility  @xcite or jump processes  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , stable option pricing has not achieved as great popularity as the classic black - scholes theory .",
    "the are two simple facts which can explain this injustice .",
    "first , an @xmath0-stable driven price ( or log - price ) does not , in general , possess finite moments .",
    "this results to an infinite option price .",
    "an interesting particular case occurs when the _ asymmetry _ of the stable distribution , traditionally denoted by @xmath4 $ ] , takes the extreme value @xmath5 . in this case",
    "it is known that all the moments exist and are finite @xcite , ensuring the option price to remain finite . this option pricing model based on stable distributions with extreme asymmetry",
    "was introduced by carr and wu @xcite and is called _",
    "finite moments log stable ( fmls ) _ model .",
    "second , due to the fact that stable distributions can not be ( with very few exceptions ) expressed analytically , all related models , including option pricing model , could be expressed in the form of integral representations .",
    "these representations often include special functions and/or complex integration .",
    "this is naturally not so attractive for practitioners , because the understanding of the model requires knowledge of advanced mathematical techniques as well as sophisticated numerical tools .",
    "first attempt at establishing a general closed formula has been made in @xcite , where the authors have derived a closed analytic pricing formula valid for any @xmath61,2]$ ] , under carr and wu s condition @xmath5 .",
    "however , this condition can be regarded as rather restrictive and not always realistic , notably for illiquid markets .",
    "it would be a great advance to have a closed pricing formula any @xmath0 and @xmath7 ( where these two parameters are to be calibrated later from market observations ) and give a finite result . in this article",
    "we prove such a formula and make numerical applications which demonstrate its efficiency .",
    "the strength of this result lies not only in the simplicity and efficiency of the formula , but also in the fact that it extends analytically to any value of @xmath4 $ ] , thus removing the a priori divergence of the model for @xmath8 .",
    "the formula of course recovers the a priori convergent cases ( carr - wu , black - scholes ) ; the existence of a finite price , even when the model is expected to diverge , is the result of a mellin - regularization process for the lvy propagator , and is a particular example of a borel summation @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes option pricing model driven by stable distribution with arbitrary asymmetry , including proper hedging policies .",
    "section 3 derives closed formula for the stable option pricing model .",
    "section 4 discusses some numerical applications , as speed of convergence of the formula or parameter estimation of the real data .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the log-_lvy - stable _ model is a non - gaussian model into which the price is assumed to be described by the stochastic differential equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the _ lvy _ distribution .",
    "naturally , logarithmic returns @xmath11",
    "( @xmath12 is eliminated due to stationarity ) are distributed by this distribution .",
    "lvy distribution is most commonly defined via its fourier transform , which reads  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14    the _ stability parameter _ @xmath15",
    "$ ] influences the overall behavior of the distribution , especially its tail decay ( for @xmath16 we recover gaussian distribution ) . in this paper",
    ", we will consider lvy distributions with stability @xmath17 which are known to be financially relevant and are sometimes called _ lvy - pareto distributions _",
    "the main reason is that sample paths of prices given by eq .",
    "are continuous _ almost everywhere_. the parameter @xmath4 $ ]",
    "is called _ asymmetry _ or _ skewness _ parameter and influences the asymmetry of the distribution . for @xmath18",
    ", we obtain a symmetric distribution .",
    "parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 play the role of location parameter , resp .",
    "scale parameter and we consider the _ standard case _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath21 @xmath22 , if not specified differently .",
    "lvy distributions have _ heavy - tails _ ; in other words they decay polynomially as @xmath23 for large @xmath24 with two exceptions . for @xmath16 , we get gaussian distribution , which decays exponentially , and for @xmath25 , we get the distribution with one heavy tail ( for @xmath26 we have positive heavy tail , and vice versa ) and the other tail with exponential decay ( for @xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "the main issue when dealing with lvy @xmath0-stable models is that the finiteness of the option price is guaranteed only in one very specific case .",
    "particularly , the existence of the exponential expectations @xmath28 \\ , = \\ , \\mathbb{e } \\left [   e^{-\\sigma l_{\\alpha,-\\beta}(t ) } \\right ] \\,\\ ] ] or equivalently , the convergence of the bilateral laplace transform , is only guaranteed when @xmath5 @xcite ; this choice of @xmath7 , reasonable for very liquid and organized markets , is , however , too specific to describe satisfactorily less liquid financial assets .",
    "we shall note that the probability distribution of log - returns @xmath29 is given as the fundamental solution ( i.e. the green function ) of the fractional partial differential equation @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the _ riesz - feller derivative _ , a 2-parameter operator defined by its action in the fourier space @xcite : @xmath32 parameter @xmath33 plays the role of diffusion coefficient and will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "parameter @xmath1 , which can be entirely determined by @xmath0 and @xmath7  @xcite , is an equivalent description of the asymmetry and is confined to a region known in fractional analysis as the _ feller - takayasu diamond _",
    "@xcite : @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath18 and @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 ) .",
    "as discussed above , infinite moments of prices , resp",
    ". diverging laplace transform of stable distributions can be serious issues in pricing of options driven lvy processes . in the next sections ,",
    "we discuss two important approaches of option pricing based on conceptually different ideas of risk elimination and hedging policy in order to understand the option pricing procedure .",
    "pricing of derivatives is based on two aspects : proper modelling of underlying asset and appropriate hedging policy .",
    "naturally , different hedging policies can lead generally to different option prices .",
    "this is also influenced by our understanding of _",
    "risk_. in this section , we will show that different hedging policies can not only lead to different option pricing , but in some cases , like in the case of @xmath0-stable distributions with arbitrary asymmetry , can lead to pathological outcomes .",
    "the main idea of the risk neutral approach is to create a risk - less portfolio , i.e. to eliminate the risk completely .",
    "the resulting option pricing rule can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 with theta being so - called _ ramp function _ @xmath40 for @xmath41 , otherwise @xmath42 .",
    "probability measure @xmath43 is the risk - neutral measure equivalent to the original price measure @xmath44 .",
    "the radon - nikodym derivative exists and can be for exponential processes expressed as    @xmath45\\ ] ]    the _ characteristic exponent _",
    "@xmath33 has its origins in the esscher transform  @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath46 which is nothing else than the logarithm of ( double - sided ) laplace transform . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the laplace transform exists only if @xmath5 and is equal to @xmath47    if @xmath48 , then because of the lvy divergence of the moments , @xmath33 becomes infinite and therefore the risk neutral option pricing approach may not be relevant .",
    "nevertheless , it is necessary to admit , that the pathology is related to exponential description of price evolution , which is based on idealized assumption of continuous stochastic processes and logarithmic returns .",
    "this approach is indeed mathematically attractive . on the other hand , in some cases , like here",
    ", it can lead to pathological or inappropriate description .",
    "however , this can be overcome in several ways . for option pricing",
    ", the inability of creating a complete hedging policy does not mean that one can not price the option  risk - minimal strategies can be set up to obtain fair option prices , as shown in the next subsection .",
    "bouchaud and sornette have proposed an original way for finding the optimal hedging strategy and for recovering the call price @xcite .",
    "let @xmath49 be the bank wealth and @xmath50 , the total variation of the bank wealth . at time",
    "@xmath51 the bank has @xmath52 shares , the true variation of its wealth @xmath49 is only due to the fluctuation of the share price @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the total bank wealth is governed by the equation , for a process @xmath54 and a given strategy @xmath52 : @xmath55 the total variation of the bank has to be zero @xmath56 , because no counterpart should be left out .",
    "the previous equation becomes : @xmath57 @xmath58 , because @xmath59 is posterior and then uncorrelated to the value of @xmath60 .",
    "for the unbiased case @xmath61 @xmath62 which is equivalent to @xmath63^+ \\ , p(s_t , t|s , t)\\ ] ] for any probability distribution @xmath64 .",
    "within this framework , it is possible to use the same ansatz as for risk - neutral approach .",
    "but since the option prices should be finite , it requires the finiteness of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the question is if the parameter @xmath33 can be regularized and if yes , what are the possible regularization approaches .",
    "the most direct condition that one can impose to be sure that the option price remains finite is @xmath65 , ( which , in the feller - takayasu representation , corresponds to @xmath66 ) ; this model was introduced by carr and wu @xcite under the name of _ finite moment log stable model_. under this _ maximal negative skewness _",
    "hypothesis , a closed formula for the option price has been derived in @xcite . in this case",
    "is @xmath33 given by eq .  .",
    "if @xmath8 , we know the model presents an a priori divergence that needs to be regularized .",
    "truncation - based techniques have been developed @xcite to give a sense to the model .",
    "our approach is different  introducing suitable mellin - barnes representations into the propagator and then integrating over the green variable ( that is , inverting the order of integration between the mellin and the green variables ) , we will bring back the problem to the computation of a series of residues which turns out to be convergent for any characteristic parameter @xmath33 ( now regarded as a parameter to be fitted or to be estimated from the data ) , and any asymmetry . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath33 becomes not only an extra parameter of the model , but it has actually its clear financial meaning .",
    "we have shown that if @xmath33 is given by eq .  , it is possible to create a risk - less portfolio , so the risk is _",
    "completely eliminated_. on the other hand , the larger @xmath33 is , the larger risk remains unhedged .",
    "this regularization provides us with a powerful pricing formula which recovers the cases already known to be convergent ( i.e. black - scholes and carr - wu model with appropriate @xmath33 ) and extends analytically to any asymmetry .",
    "the underlying mathematical techniques ( distributional aspects of the mellin transform , as well as residue theory in @xmath2 ) are exposed with full details in @xcite .",
    "this section extends previous two sections and introduces option pricing under log - lvy stable process with arbitrary asymmetry .",
    "additionally , we derive a series representation with help of distributional mellin calculus in @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting formula can be efficiently used for practical calculations as well as for parameter estimations .      under an @xmath0-stable process",
    ", the price of an european call can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath67^+ \\times \\frac{1}{(-\\mu \\tau)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha } } } g_{\\alpha,\\theta}\\left(\\frac{y}{(-\\mu \\tau)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}}\\right ) { \\mathrm{d}}y\\ ] ] the lvy propagator is a particular case of the bouchaud - sornette formulation where the green function @xmath68 has been expressed as the inverse fourier transform of the lvy characteristic function , which satisfies the fractional pde .",
    "these green functions have been extensively studied e.g. in @xcite , and can be expressed as mellin - barnes integrals : @xmath69    in the next , we introduce two useful integral representations . first , payoff function @xmath70^+$ ] can be represented as a mellin - barnes integral with fundamental strip @xmath71 .",
    "the integral has the following form : @xmath72^+ \\ , = \\ , \\frac{k}{2i\\pi } \\int\\limits_{c_s - i\\infty}^{c_s+i\\infty } -\\frac{e^{-(r+\\mu ) \\tau s - ys}}{s(s+1)}\\big(\\frac{s}{k}\\big)^{-s}\\ , ds\\ ] ] this can be shown by a straightforward calculation , see @xcite for a complete proof .",
    "second , the exponential @xmath73 appearing in the option pricing formula can be rewritten as @xmath74 with the fundamental strip @xmath75 . this representation is a very direct consequence of the mellin - barnes representation for the exponential function .",
    "note that , in all rigor , it needs @xmath33 to be negative to hold because we are integrating along the line @xmath76 .",
    "this is fulfilled for stable processes with @xmath77 . replacing the last two integrals into eq .   and",

    "this vector characterizes the area @xmath104 which defines the region of all residues necessary to sum up in order to represent the original mellin - barnes integral as a convergent residue sum .",
    "further aspects of multidimensional mellin calculus and all technical details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it is immediate to show that characteristic quantity associated to @xmath105 is @xmath106 thus , we must consider the singularities situated in the half plane @xmath107 that is , located below the line @xmath108 it is fundamental to note that , under the condition @xmath27 , the slope of @xmath109 is positive and therefore singularities in @xmath110 are singularities right of @xmath109 .",

    "naturally , this continuation lacks of the probabilistic interpretation , but on the other hand highlights some remarkable properties , such as the existence of two opposites values of @xmath1 into which the option prices seem to intersect for all values of @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta1 ] .",
    "another remarkable feature is that , when an option is at the money , its price is entirely determined by the stability parameter @xmath0 , and is not sensitive to the asymmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] ) .",

    "the dotted lines represent the theoretically accessible values of @xmath1 in the feller - takayasu diamond ; interestingly , the call prices can be extrapolated smoothly outside the feller - takayasu diamond , and all intersect in two opposite points , independently of the underlying price . ]    .",
    "note that the values of the call prices are very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 ; for instance , for the classical mandelbrot calibration of the cotton price ( @xmath152 ) , the gaussian ( black - scholes ) model dramatically underestimates the call value inside the feller takayasu diamond .",
    "the lower ( resp .",

    "according to the moneyness .",
    "a negative value of @xmath1 will underestimate ( resp .",

    "when @xmath0 is closed to @xmath155 ( cauchy distribution , with a mean becoming infinite ) and when @xmath16 ( gaussian distribution ) , the call value is not sensitive to the asymmetry , which is an expected behavior .",
    "remarkably , this `` asymmetry - independent '' behavior also occurs when the option is at the money ( middle graph ) . ]    , for @xmath156 . except when the option is at the money , the impact of the asymmetry is very significant , even when restrained to the feller - takayasu diamond ( here @xmath157 $ ] ) , and would be even bigger when letting @xmath1 out of the diamond .",
    "this strong asymmetry - dependence points out the restrictive aspect of the carr - wu hypothesis . ]",
    "finally , table  [ fig : series ] presents the residue coefficients for particular choice of parameters and demonstrates the speed of convergence .",
    "we deduce that the formula converges very quickly after a few terms ( the precision is @xmath158 for @xmath159 ) .",
    "this is an important step overcoming technical difficulties when dealing with lvy processes : so far , the relevant quantities were usually calculated via inverse fourier transform , inverse mellin transform or other similar integral transforms , which are relatively time consuming .",

    "actually , this is not surprising , because @xmath7 is very close to @xmath164 , so one can not expect a large improvement .",

    "the first attempt has be made by introduction of truncated lvy which makes the option price finite .",
    "however , probably because of necessary estimation of a cut - off , there have not become consensually acknowledged .",
    "carr and wu , in a second attempt , introduced a maximal asymmetry hypothesis in the distribution , but this constraint , well adapted to very liquid markets , may fail at describing realistically risky assets which often have an almost symmetric heavy tail .",
    "another practical drawback can also be pointed out : the absence of a simple closed pricing formula in the european case , except in a very limited class of stable distributions makes these models unappealing to practitioners .",
    "there is no doubt than the success of the black and scholes paradigm is , for a great part , due to the existence of a simple and easily understandable formula .    by introduction of the @xmath2 mellin calculus @xcite and its further generalization to the distributional mellin calculus@xcite",
    ", we have derived a closed formula for the generic class of lvy distributions which recover all the cases already known to be convergent and is to be regarded as the non - gaussian analogue to the black - scholes formula , this `` analytic extension '' ( in fact a particular case of a borel summation ) removes the artificial divergence and regularizes the model in a very natural way .",
    "we have discussed the efficiency of the formula and demonstrated the performance of this option pricing approach on the real financial data .",
    "we hope than the distributional mellin calculus in @xmath2 will be used to solve other mathematical problems and other financial models ( notably models driven by double - fractional space - time diffusion ) and , mainly , we do hope than the pricing formula ( [ levy_arbitrary_closed_mu ] ) will help to popularize stable option pricing and will contribute to change the paradigm in financial mathematics .",
