    "our object of study in this paper is the critical value function in hggstrm s divide and color ( dac ) model @xcite .",
    "this is a stochastic model that was originally motivated by physical considerations ( see @xcite ) , but it has since then been used for biological modelling in @xcite as well and inspired several generalizations ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "our results concerning the location of the phase transition give a clear picture of the behavior of the dac model on two important lattices and lead to intriguing open questions .",
    "our analysis will be based on the same principles as @xcite , where confidence intervals were obtained for the critical value of bernoulli bond and site percolation on the 11 archimedean lattices by a modification of the approach of @xcite .",
    "the main idea in @xcite is truly multidisciplinary and attractive , namely to reduce a problem which has its roots in theoretical physics by deep mathematical theorems to a situation in which a form of statistical testing by numerical methods becomes possible .",
    "our other main goal with this paper is to demonstrate the strength of this strategy by applying it to a system which is essentially different from those in its previous applications . in particular , in the dac model , as opposed to the short - range dependencies in @xcite and the i.i.d .",
    "situation in @xcite , one has to deal with correlations between sites at arbitrary distances from each other .",
    "we believe that the method of @xcite has a high potential to be used in a number of further models ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite where a very similar approach is followed ) and deserves higher publicity than it enjoys at the moment .    given a graph @xmath6 with vertex set @xmath7 and edge set @xmath8 and parameters @xmath9 $ ] , the dac model on @xmath6 is defined in two steps : first , bernoulli bond percolation with density @xmath4 is performed on @xmath6 , and then the resulting open clusters are independently colored black ( with probability @xmath10 ) or white ( a more detailed definition will follow in the next paragraph ) . note that this definition resembles the so - called random - cluster ( or fk ) representation of the ferromagnetic ising model , with two important differences : a product measure is used in the dac model in the first step instead of a random - cluster measure with cluster weight @xmath11 and the second step is more general here in that all @xmath12 $ ] are considered instead of only @xmath13 .",
    "now we set the terminology that is used throughout , starting with an alternative ( equivalent ) definition of the dac model which goes as follows .",
    "first , an _ edge configuration _",
    "@xmath14 is drawn according to the product measure @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability measure on @xmath17 with @xmath18 . in the second step ,",
    "a _ site configuration _ @xmath19 is chosen by independently assigning state @xmath20 with probability @xmath10 or otherwise @xmath21 to each vertex , conditioning on the event that there exists no edge @xmath22 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the probability measure on @xmath25 associated to this procedure by @xmath26 .",
    "an edge @xmath27 ( a vertex @xmath28 ) is said to be _ open _ or _ closed _",
    "( _ black _ or _ white _ ) if and only if it is in state @xmath20 or @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "we will call the maximal subsets of @xmath7 connected by open edges _",
    "bond clusters _ , and the maximal monochromatic connected ( via the edge set of @xmath8 , not only the open edges ! ) subsets of @xmath7 _ black _ or _",
    "white clusters_. we write @xmath29 for the bond cluster of a vertex @xmath28 in the edge configuration @xmath30 and use @xmath31 to denote @xmath32 for arbitrary sets @xmath33 .",
    "note that the measure @xmath26 is concentrated on the set of pairs @xmath34 such that for all edges @xmath35 , @xmath36 whenever @xmath37 .",
    "when this compatibility condition is satisfied , we write @xmath38 .    for infinite graphs @xmath6",
    ", there are two types of phase transitions present in the dac model in terms of the appearance of infinite @xmath20-clusters ; first , there exists @xmath39 $ ] such that @xmath40there exists an infinite bond cluster@xmath41 is @xmath21 for @xmath5 and @xmath20 for @xmath42 .",
    "second , for each fixed @xmath4 , there exists @xmath43 such that @xmath40there exists an infinite black cluster@xmath41 is @xmath21 for @xmath44 and _ positive _ for @xmath45 . for more on the different character of these two types of phase transitions ,",
    "see @xcite . a key feature of the dac model ( as noted in @xcite )",
    "is that while it is close in spirit to the ising model , its simulation is straightforward from the definition and does not require sophisticated mcmc algorithms . in this paper , we will exploit this feature in order to learn about the values and various features of the _ critical value function _ @xmath46 .",
    "monotonicity and continuity properties of the function @xmath46 for general graphs have been studied in @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on two specific graphs , namely the _ square lattice _ @xmath0 and the _ hexagonal lattice _ @xmath1 ( see figure [ lattices ] ) , for which @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our reason for this restriction is twofold : first , these two are the most commonly considered planar lattices ( apart from the triangular lattice @xmath2 , for which the critical value function @xmath49 has been completely characterized in @xcite ) , whence results about these cases are of the greatest interest . on the other hand , the dac model on these lattices enjoys a form of duality ( described in section [ duality - subsection ] ) which is a key ingredient for the analysis we perform in this paper .",
    "fixing @xmath50 , it is trivial that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , and it easily follows from classical results on bernoulli bond percolation that @xmath53 ( see @xcite for the case @xmath54 ) .",
    "however , there are only very loose theoretical bounds for the critical value when @xmath55 : the duality relation ( [ rcplusrcstaris1 ] ) in section [ duality - subsection ] below and renormalization arguments as in the proof of theorem 2.6 in @xcite give that @xmath56 for all such @xmath4 , and proposition 1 in @xcite gives just a slight improvement of these bounds for very small values of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , our ultimate goal here is to get good estimates for @xmath57 with @xmath55 .",
    "we end this section with an outline of the paper .",
    "section [ fsc - section ] contains a crucial reduction of the infinite - volume models to a _",
    "situation by a criterion that is stated in terms of a finite sublattice but nonetheless implies the existence of an infinite cluster .",
    "this method , often called static renormalisation in percolation , is a particular instance of coarse graining .",
    "we then describe in section [ confidence - interval - section ] how the occurrence of this finite size criterion can be tested in an efficient way and obtain confidence intervals for @xmath57 as functions of uniform random variables ( proposition [ confintprop ] ) .",
    "finally , we implement this method using a ( pseudo)random number generator , and present and discuss the numerical results in section [ results - section ] .",
    "in this section , we will show how to obtain an upper bound for @xmath57 by deducing a finite size criterion for percolation in the dac model ( proposition [ fscpropositionforp>0 ] ) .",
    "this criterion , which is a quantitative form of lemma 2.10 in @xcite , will play a key role in sections [ confidence - interval - section][results - section ] . to enhance readability ,",
    "we will henceforth focus on the case @xmath54 and mention @xmath58 only when the analogy is not straightforward .",
    "accordingly , we will write @xmath59 and @xmath3 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , and denote the edge set of @xmath0 by @xmath62 .",
    "let us first recall a classical result ( lemma [ 1deplemma ] below ) concerning 1-dependent percolation",
    ".    given a graph @xmath63 , a probability measure @xmath64 on @xmath65 is called _ 1-dependent _ if , whenever @xmath66 and @xmath67 are vertex - disjoint edge sets , the state of edges in @xmath33 is independent of that of edges in @xmath68 under @xmath64 .",
    "it follows from standard arguments or from a general theorem of liggett , schonmann and stacey @xcite that if each edge is open with a sufficiently high probability in a 1-dependent bond percolation on @xmath0 , then the origin is with positive probability in an infinite bond cluster .",
    "currently the best bound is given by balister , bollobs and walters @xcite :    _ ( @xcite)_[1deplemma ] let @xmath64 be any 1-dependent bond percolation measure on @xmath69 in which each edge is open with probability at least @xmath70 .",
    "then the probability under @xmath64 that the origin lies in an infinite bond cluster is positive .",
    "now , suppose that the lattice @xmath0 is embedded in the plane the natural way ( so that @xmath71 has coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "we consider the following partition of @xmath74 ( see figure [ partition ] ) : given parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we take @xmath77 and define , for all @xmath78 , the @xmath79 squares @xmath80\\times [ jk+\\ell , jk+\\ell + s],\\ ] ] the @xmath81 rectangles @xmath82\\times [ jk-\\ell , jk+\\ell ] , \\ ] ] the @xmath83 rectangles @xmath84\\times [ jk+\\ell , jk+\\ell + s],\\ ] ] and what remains are the @xmath85 squares @xmath86\\times [ jk-\\ell , jk+\\ell ] .",
    "$ ]    . ]",
    "we will couple @xmath87 to a @xmath20-dependent bond percolation measure .",
    "define @xmath88 , as follows .",
    "to each horizontal edge @xmath89 , we associate a @xmath90 rectangle @xmath91 and the event @xmath92 that there exists a left - right black crossing in @xmath93 ( _ i.e. _ , a connected path of vertices all of which are black which links the left side of @xmath93 to its right side ) and an up - down black crossing in @xmath94 ( see figure [ blackpaths ] ) .",
    "witnesses the occurrence of @xmath92 . ]    here and below , a vertex in the corner of a rectangle is understood to link the corresponding sides in itself . for each vertical edge @xmath95",
    ", we define the @xmath96 rectangle @xmath97 and the event @xmath98up - down black crossing in @xmath93 and left - right black crossing in @xmath99 . for each edge @xmath100",
    ", we also consider the event @xmath101there exists a bond cluster which contains a vertex in @xmath93 and a vertex at graph distance at least @xmath102 from @xmath103 , and define @xmath104 . now for each configuration @xmath105 , we determine a corresponding bond configuration @xmath106 as follows : for all @xmath100 , we declare @xmath27 open if and only if @xmath107 holds ( _ i.e. _ , we define @xmath108 if and only if @xmath109 ) .",
    "finally , we define the probability measure @xmath110 on @xmath111 .",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath64 is a 1-dependent bond percolation measure . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath112 are two vertex - disjoint edges in @xmath62 , then the corresponding rectangles @xmath113 and @xmath114 are at graph distance at least @xmath115 from one another , hence @xmath116 and @xmath117 are independent . given that @xmath118 and @xmath119 do not hold , the bond clusters in @xmath93 and @xmath114 are colored independently of each other . keeping this in mind ,",
    "a short computation proves the independence of @xmath120 and @xmath121 under @xmath59 , which implies the 1-dependence of @xmath64 .",
    "note also that the function @xmath122 was chosen in such a way that if @xmath123 contains an infinite open bond cluster , then @xmath124 contains an infinite black cluster .",
    "such configurations have zero @xmath87-measure for @xmath125 . finally , note that @xmath126 is the same for all edges @xmath100 .",
    "these observations combined with lemma [ 1deplemma ] imply that , denoting @xmath127 by @xmath128 , we have the following result .",
    "[ fscpropositionforp>0 ] given any values of the parameters @xmath129 , if @xmath4 and @xmath10 are such that @xmath130 then @xmath131 .",
    "note that proposition [ fscpropositionforp>0 ] is indeed a finite size criterion since the event @xmath132 depends on the state of a finite number of edges and the color of a finite number of vertices . a similar criterion , which will imply a lower bound for @xmath3 , will be given in section [ lowerbound - subsection ] .",
    "a concept that is essential in understanding site percolation models on @xmath133 is that of the _ matching lattice _ @xmath134 which is a graph with the same vertex set , @xmath7 , as @xmath135 but more edges : the edge set @xmath136 of @xmath134 consists of all the edges in @xmath8 plus the diagonals of all the faces of @xmath135 ( see figure  [ lattices ] ) .",
    "the finiteness of a monochromatic cluster in @xmath135 can be rephrased in terms of circuits of the opposite color in @xmath134 and vice versa ; see @xcite for further details .",
    "we say that @xmath137 is a _ black _ @xmath138__-component _ _ in a color configuration @xmath139 if it is a black component in terms of the lattice @xmath134 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath140 for all @xmath141 and @xmath142 is connected via @xmath136 ) .",
    "accordingly , there is yet another phase transition in the dac model on @xmath135 at the point where an infinite black @xmath138-component appears ; formally , for each fixed @xmath143 $ ] , one can define @xmath144 as the value such that @xmath145there exists an infinite black @xmath138-component@xmath41 is @xmath21 for @xmath146 and positive for @xmath147 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that there is an intimate connection between all the critical values in the dac model that we mentioned so far ; namely , for all @xmath55 , @xmath148 actually , this relation was proved only for @xmath54 , but essentially the same proof gives the result for @xmath58 as well .",
    "the importance of this result here is that due to the duality relation ( [ rcplusrcstaris1 ] ) , a lower bound for @xmath57 may be obtained by giving an upper bound for @xmath144 .      as in section",
    "[ upperbound - subsection ] , we will focus on @xmath54 since the case @xmath58 is analogous ; we denote @xmath149 here and in the next section by @xmath150 .",
    "obviously @xmath3 itself is an upper bound for @xmath150",
    ". however , a better bound may be obtained by a slight modification of the approach given in section [ upperbound - subsection ] . for each @xmath100 , let @xmath93 and @xmath118 be as in section [ upperbound - subsection ] , define @xmath151 by substituting black @xmath138-component for black component in the definition of @xmath92 , and take @xmath152 . then , by similar arguments as those before proposition [ fscpropositionforp>0 ] and using ( [ rcplusrcstaris1 ] ) , we get the following :    [ fscstarpropositionforp>0 ] given any values of the parameters @xmath129 , if @xmath4 and @xmath10 are such that @xmath153 then @xmath154 , and hence @xmath155 .",
    "the main idea in @xcite is to reduce a stochastic model to a new model in finite volume by criteria similar in spirit to those in section [ fsc - section ] and do repeated ( computer ) simulations of the new model to test whether the corresponding criteria hold .",
    "the point is that after a sufficiently large number of simulations , one can see with an arbitrarily high level of confidence whether or not the probability of an event exceeds a certain threshold . by the special nature of the events in question , statistical inferences regarding the original , infinite - volume model may be made from the simulation results .    to be able to follow this strategy",
    ", we will have to refine propositions [ fscpropositionforp>0][fscstarpropositionforp>0 ] as those are concerned with the state of finitely many objects , but still in the infinite - volume model .",
    "the adjusted criteria that truly are of finite size are given below , see ( [ gtildeee ] ) and ( [ gtildeeestar ] ) . finding an efficient way of performing the simulation step involves further obstacles .",
    "the main problem is that it would be unfeasible to run a large number of separate simulations for different values of @xmath10 to find , for a fixed @xmath4 , the lowest value of @xmath10 such that both ( [ gtildeee ] ) and ( [ gtildeeestar ] ) seem sufficiently likely to hold",
    ". we will tackle this difficulty with a stochastic coupling , which is the simultaneous construction of several stochastic models on the same probability space .",
    "such a construction will enable us to deal with _ all _ values of @xmath12 $ ] at the same time and is very related to the model of invasion percolation .",
    "after the description of the coupling , a `` theoretical '' confidence interval ( meaning a confidence interval as a function of i.i.d.random variables ) for @xmath3 is given in proposition [ confintprop ] .",
    "the numerical confidence intervals obtained by this method using computer simulations will be presented in section [ results - section ] .",
    "note also that the inequalities ( [ gtildeee ] ) and ( [ gtildeeestar ] ) implicitly involve the parameters @xmath156 and @xmath157 whose choices may influence the width of the confidence intervals obtained ; this issue is addressed before the proof of proposition [ confintprop ] .",
    "our methods in this section work for a general @xmath158 ; we note that substantial simplifications are possible in the case @xmath159 ( _ i.e. _ , in the absence of correlations ) , see @xcite .",
    "fix @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and define the rectangle @xmath162\\times [ 0,s+2\\ell ] $ ] .",
    "note that for a configuration @xmath163 , one can decide whether @xmath164 ( respectively @xmath165 ) holds by checking the restriction of @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",

    "we are interested in the following question : for what values of @xmath10 does @xmath185 ( respectively ,",
    "@xmath186 ) hold ?",
    "the first step is to look at the edges in @xmath30 in @xmath187 to see if there is a bond cluster which connects @xmath188 and the boundary of @xmath189 .",
    "if no such connection is found , it is easy to see that there exists a _ threshold value _",
    "@xmath190 $ ] such that for all @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and for all @xmath193 $ ] , we have that @xmath194 .",
    "indeed , the color configurations are coupled in such a way that if @xmath195 and @xmath194 then @xmath196 , since all vertices that are black in @xmath197 are black in @xmath198 as well .",

    "i.e. _ , if there is a connection in @xmath30 between @xmath188 and the boundary of @xmath167 , we know that neither of @xmath205 or @xmath206 has occurred . hence , in that case , we define @xmath207 , which preserves the above `` threshold value '' properties as @xmath208=(r_1^*,1]=\\varnothing $ ] .    now ,",
    "if we want a confidence interval with confidence level @xmath209 where @xmath210 is fixed , we choose positive integers @xmath211 and @xmath212 in such a way that the probability of having at least @xmath211 successes among @xmath212 bernoulli experiments with success probability @xmath70 each is smaller than ( but close to ) @xmath213 .",

    "in fact , with very small ( @xmath226 ) probability , @xmath227 can occur .",
    "otherwise , for unreasonable choices of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , taking a too small @xmath157 in particular , it could happen that there is a connection in the bond configuration between @xmath188 and the boundary of @xmath167 in at least @xmath228 experiments out of the @xmath212 , in which case @xmath224=[0,1]$ ] indeed contains @xmath3 but gives no new information .",

    "we implemented the method described in the previous section in a computer program , and the results for parameter values @xmath245 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 are given below .",
    "we stress again that although the method in section [ confidence - interval - section ] that determines a confidence interval for @xmath57 is mathematically rigorous , the results below are obtained by using the random number generator @xcite , therefore their correctness depends on `` how random '' the generated numbers are .",

    "this suggests that the dac model on @xmath0 or @xmath250 is qualitatively different from the dac model on the triangular lattice , where the critical value of @xmath10 is @xmath13 for all subcritical @xmath4 ( see theorem 1.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath251 would mean that the difference disappears as @xmath4 converges to .",
    "the fact that the difference should disappear was conjectured by one of the authors ( vb ) and federico camia , based on the following heuristic reasoning . near @xmath252 , the structure of the random graph determined by the bond configuration ( whose vertices correspond to the bond clusters , and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding bond clusters are adjacent in @xmath135 ) is given by the geometry of `` near - critical percolation clusters , '' which is expected to be universal for @xmath11-dimensional planar graphs .",
    "this suggests that the critical @xmath10 for @xmath4 close to its critical value should not depend much on the original underlying lattice , and we expect the convergence of @xmath57 to @xmath13 to be universal and hold in the case of any @xmath11-dimensional lattice .",
