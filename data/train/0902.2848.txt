    "sipms are excellent photosensors for low - intensity light detection . with increasing light intensities , however , their response becomes non linear requiring monitoring . in the calice ahcal prototype we installed an led / pin - diode - based monitoring system to measure the sipm gain ,",
    "monitor the sipm response for fixed light intensities and record the full sipm response function when necessary .",
    "we also record the reverse bias voltage of each sipm and the temperature measured by five sensors in each layer with a slow - control system , since the sipm response is very sensitive to changes in these parameters .",
    "we studied the sipm response function in test beam calibration runs .",
    "if we find an analytic function that parameterizes the sipm response , the monitoring system might be simplified .",
    "the exact shape would be measured once on the test bench before installation .",
    "the raw energy in a cell measured in units of adc bins , @xmath0 $ ] , is converted into units of mips via a calibration factor @xmath1 $ ]    @xmath2 = \\frac{q^{meas}_{cell}[adc]}{c^{mip}_{cell}[adc ] } \\cdot f^{-1}_{sat}(q^{meas}_{cell}[pixel]),\\ ] ]    where @xmath3)$ ] is the non - linear response parameterized as a function of pixels .",
    "it includes an intercalibration factor matching the pixel and mip calibration scales @xcite .",
    "we measure the sipm gain with low - intensity led light , the position of the mip peak with muons and the non - linearity by varying the led light intensity . gain and light yield vary with temperature ( reverse bias voltage ) as @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "the standard procedure consists of adjusting @xmath6 and @xmath7 for temperature changes . here , corrections are instantaneous but non - local , since @xmath8 is measured frequently at five positions per layer during a run . since the gain of each cell",
    "is measured several times a day , we could also correct @xmath7 for gain changes by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this procedure is local but not instantaneous .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy ] shows energy and energy resolution measurements of 10 50  gev positrons in comparison to simulations @xcite .",
    "the data is corrected for saturation and temperature effects using cell - wise gain and mip calibration constants and layer - wise average temperature correction factors .",
    "the reconstructed energy is linear up to 30  gev . at 50  gev deviations from linearity increase to @xmath10 suggesting the need for a refined analysis procedure .",
    "the energy resolution fits the standard form containing a stochastic term , a constant and a noise term .",
    "the bare simulations demonstrate that detector effects are important .",
    "simulations that include detector effects , however , are still too optimistic and require refinements .",

    "we extract sipm and pin diode raw data from lcio files , perform pedestal subtraction with vcalib runs , apply gain corrections , and use intercalibration constants . for each vcalib value we perform gaussian fits to the sipm and pin diode response to determine mean values and their errors .",
    "we plot the pin - diode response versus the sipm response after rescaling the pin - diode values to start at a common origin with a slope of one .",
    "so far we analyzed four calibration runs from the cern test beam in 2006 and 2007 @xcite .    at itep , the response of all 7608 sipms was measured prior to installation into the ahcal prototype using calibrated led light shone directly onto the sipm .",
    "figure  [ fig : curves ] ( top ) shows the itep measurements after scaling raw data to start at a common origin with slope one .",
    "the curves fit to @xmath11 , where the saturation @xmath12 and @xmath13 are free parameters . in the test beam the sipm response",
    "is measured with high - gain and low - gain preamplifier settings .",
    "since the curves do not fit to @xmath14 , we constructed the function    @xmath15,\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 and @xmath18 are free parameters in the fit .",
    "the latter is a scale factor that accounts for mismatch between high - gain and low - gain regions . with simpler forms we obtained fewer successful fits .",
    "r0.5                figures  [ fig : curves](middle , bottom ) show response curves of a typical sipm for itep and test beam data , respectively .",
    "fitting all available sipms in the four calibration runs , we get 5060@xmath19 successful fits . in the 31 - 07 - 07 run @xmath20 of all fits were successful , @xmath21 failed due to a small confidence level and @xmath22 failed due to malfunctioning of the sipm or pin diode . for successful fits , parameter @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) peaks at @xmath25  @xmath26 with fwhm of @xmath27 .",
    "apart from a few outliers at higher values , a spike near zero is visible .",
    "parameter @xmath13 peaks near @xmath28 with fwhm of @xmath29 , while parameter @xmath30 lies around @xmath31 with fwhm of @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : saturation](left ) shows saturation values for 12 - 07 - 07 and 31 - 07 - 07 calibration runs . for the later run , the saturation peaks near @xmath33 pixels and has a width of fwhm@xmath34 pixels , while for the earlier run the peak is shifted upward by @xmath35 pixels .",
    "this is consistent with expected temperature variations that are not corrected for .",
    "in addition , we see a long tail up to @xmath36 pixels in both runs that is also visible in itep data .",
    "this results from a particular batch of sipms with a lower internal resistor causing multiple pixel excitations during illumination .",
    "a comparison of saturation values of sipms in modules 315 for four runs taken in 2006 and 2006 shows no degradation thus confirming stable operation in the test beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : saturation](right ) shows a comparison of saturation values measured in the 31 - 07 - 07 run and at itep .",
    "the itep data peak around @xmath37 pixels with a fwhm of @xmath38 pixels indicating that nearly all 1156 pixels in the sipms are triggered . here , the sipms were illuminated directly by leds , while the light transport in the test beam is rather complex .",
    "the sipm records the light from a 1  mm thick wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fiber coupled via an air gap .",
    "though a 0.2  mm air gap is sufficient for a full illumination of all pixels , losses may occur due to imperfect alignment of the fiber and sipm .",
    "because of the large discrepancy between itep and test beam data , the non - linearity corrections are presently based on the itep saturation measurements with an additional scaling by the ratio of saturation values measured for each sipm in the test beam and at itep .",
    "we found an analytical function that successfully parameterizes about @xmath20 of the sipm response curves in the calice ahcal prototype . in order to improve this close to @xmath39 we need to investigate causes for poor fits and test other analytical functions .",
    "the present studies show that the sipm operation in the cern test beam is stable .",
    "we observe a discrepancy of saturation values measured at itep and in the test beam of about @xmath40 , which may be caused by a misalignment of the wls fiber and the sipm .",
    "we need to verify that we can model temperature and voltage changes in the sipm response curves and we need to extend our studies to include 2008 test beam data at fermilab .    at the present level of understanding a full monitoring system",
    "is necessary that allows us to measure the full sipm response any time .",
    "the system , however , may be simplified .",
    "two options are under discussion .",
    "the first option is based on the present monitoring system but foresees long clear fibers , each illuminating one row of tiles rather than individual tiles .",
    "this would reduce the number of leds but it may not achieve sufficient light intensities in all tiles ( see j. zalesak s talk  @xcite ) .",
    "the second option consists of embedding one led per tile eliminating fibers but requiring a huge number of led s .",
    "system tests started to optimize led positions , check the homogeneity of the response and test different led types .",
    "the light calibration is compared to the response of a radioactive source .",
    "the system will be temperature controlled .",
    "first tests show no cross - talk , but optimization for dynamic range and led uniformity is needed .",
