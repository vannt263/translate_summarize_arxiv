    "on the basis of thermodynamical considerations and quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) calculations , nuclear matter , in conditions of high temperature and density , is expected to undergo a phase transition to a deconfined state : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "these conditions can be recreated in high energy nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "non - central nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions are characterized by an initial geometrical anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane ( the plane defined by the beam direction and the impact parameter ) . as a consequence of the different pressure gradients in the in - plane and out - of - plane regions ,",
    "this spatial anisotropy is converted to a momentum anisotropy of produced low-@xmath6 particles .",
    "the momentum anisotropy can be quantified via a fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle with respect to the estimated reaction plane .",
    "the second coefficient of this expansion @xmath3 is called elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of heavy - flavour hadron production is sensitive to the degree of thermalization of heavy quarks in the expanding medium and to the path length dependence of their energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the d meson azimuthal anisotropy measurements presented in this report are performed with the alice detector  @xcite using the 2011 data sample collected with a minimum bias trigger given by the coincidence of signals in the vzero scintillators and the silicon pixel detector ( spd ) and a trigger tuned to enhance the sample of 50% most central collisions , based on the vzero signal amplitude , which is used to classify the events according to centrality .",
    "the analyses have been peroformed with @xmath7 pb  pb collisions in the centrality class 3050%,@xmath8 in 1530% and @xmath9 in 07.5% .",
    "the azimuthal direction of the event plane , which estimates the reaction plane direction , is determinated from the distribution of charged tracks in the @xmath10 pseudo - rapidity interval of the time projection chamber ( tpc ) using the equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the second harmonic event plane and @xmath13 is the angle of the @xmath14 track in the alice reference frame .",
    "the event plane resolution ( @xmath15 ) was computed considering each event as splitted in 2 sub - events , made of randomly combined tracks and associated to the correspondent event plane angle , following the prescription in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting event plane is flat to about 2% level and its resolution is 0.86 in the 3050% centrality class , 0.9 in 1530% and 0.75 in 07.5% .",
    "d meson reconstruction in alice is based on the invariant mass analysis of fully reconstructed hadronic decay topologies of these channels : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the separation of about a few hundred @xmath19 m between the primary and the secondary vertices , peculiar of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay , is exploited to reduce the combinatorial background . in alice ,",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed with a six layers silicon tracker ( inner tracking system ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "in particular , the silicon pixel detector ( spd ) provides a measurement of track impact parameter to the primary vertex with a resolution better than 65 @xmath19 m for tracks with @xmath20 .",
    "particle identification is provided by the time of flight measurement in the time - of - flight detector for kaons with @xmath21 and by the specific energy deposit in the tpc . for high-@xmath6 particles ,",
    "a selection is applied in order to reject protons without loosing possible kaons .",
    "the contribution of signal candidates with wrong mass assignement to the final state hadrons was found to be negligible and it does not bias the signal extraction .",
    "further details on the analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed d meson candidates is considered in the in - plane and out - of - plane regions defined as @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , where @xmath24 is the azimuthal angle of the reconstructed candidate with respect to the event plane @xmath12 .",
    "an invariant mass analysis , based on a gaussian fit , is used to obtain the signal yield in the two regions ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "assuming that the reconstruction and selection efficiency is indipendent of @xmath24 , it is possible to directly compute the elliptic flow from the formula ( [ eq_v2_raa ] , left ) , where @xmath15 is the event plane resolution .",
    "@xmath27 the @xmath28 measurement is based on the comparison between the yield measured in aa collisions and the cross section measured in pp collisions , scaled by the overlap nuclear function , as shown in formula ( [ eq_v2_raa ] , right ) . for this analysis ,",
    "the yields @xmath29 and @xmath30 were corrected for acceptance and efficiency as a function of @xmath6 , using pythia + hijing monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",

    "the main contributions come from uncertainties on the yield extraction and from the topological cut selection .",
    "the former is estimated using different background functions in the fitting precedure , different mass range , and a bin counting method .",
    "the analysis was also repeated with three different sets of topological cuts .",
    "yield extraction and cut variation systematic uncertainties are estimated to be at maximum 0.05 absolute value , for the @xmath3 analysis .",
    "the signal sample considered contains a fraction of d mesons coming from b decays , thus the measured elliptic flow is a combination of prompt and secondary d meson anisotropy .",
    "the feed - down correction uses as input pqcd calculations of b production , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting systematic uncertainty on @xmath3 is up to @xmath33 , including a conservative variation of the unknown @xmath4 and @xmath3 of d meson from b decays .",
    "the centrality dependence of the event plane resolution in the centrality range considered was also taken into account , together with the uncertainty on the resolution .",
    "for the 30 - 50% centrality class , these uncertainties were found to be @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the small difference of efficiencies in the two @xmath24 region was found to give a negligible contribution to the @xmath3 uncertainties .",
    "the d meson anisotropy was measured in the 3050% centrality class : for @xmath0 in the range @xmath36 , @xmath1 in @xmath37 and @xmath2 in @xmath38 .",
    "the three results are compatible within statistical uncertainties and all are compatible with the alice measurement of charged hadrons in the same rapidity region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmesv2 ] , left ) .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath3 measurement was also performed in the centrality classes 1530% and 07.5% in the range @xmath39 .",
    "the results for the first two @xmath6 intervals show a hint of increasing @xmath3 from central to semi - peripheral collisions , as reported in fig.[fig : dmesv2 ] , right .",
    "@xmath3 was measured using two - particles correlation methods as well .",
    "the results are consistent with those based on the event plane .",
    "the measurement of the d meson anisotropy was compared to theoretical predictions  @xcite : it was observed that a simultaneous description of the anisotropy and of the @xmath4 suppression is challenging for models .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath4 in the two azimuthal regions , in - plane and out - of - plane , was measured in the range @xmath40 .",
    "the measurement shows more suppression in the out - of - plane region with respect to the in - plane one , suggesting a path length dependence of heavy quark energy loss , which is expected to be the dominant effect at high @xmath6 ( fig .",

    "the whdg  @xcite and powlang  @xcite models show a good agreement with out - of - plane results while they somewhat oversuppress the in - plane yields .",
    "this high-@xmath6 feature is present also for the bamps model  @xcite , which instead can describe the data in the low-@xmath6 range .",

    "the measurement of the @xmath0 @xmath4 around two orthogonal directions with respect to the event plane , in the 3050% centrality class , indicates a larger suppression in the out - of - plane direction , where the initial overlap region of the two nuclei is more elonged , suggesting a path lenght dependence of heavy - quark energy loss .",
