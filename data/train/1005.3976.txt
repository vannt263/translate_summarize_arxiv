    "a parity meter couples two qubits and allows to measure whether the qubits are in the even subspace spanned by the even states @xmath0 or in the odd subspace spanned by the odd states @xmath1 .",
    "a particular basis for these two subspaces are the four bell states , which are the maximal entangled states for two qubits . as these bell states are also eigenstates of the parity operator for two qubits , a parity measurement drives the qubits into a bell state and constitutes a source of entanglement .",
    "the parity detection is thus of special importance in the possible implementation of quantum computation schemes.@xcite     is the phase accumulated by the electrons passing through the upper ( lower ) arm of the mzi over a length l. these phases depend on the state of the qubits . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the capacitances characterizing the double quantum dots ( dqds).,width=226 ]    realizations of parity meters for charge and spin qubits have been discussed considering a quantum point contact ( qpc ) as detector.@xcite the purpose of our work is to investigate parity detection of charge qubits with the help of a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) as shown in fig .",
    "the mzi is the simplest possible type of interferometer .",
    "it has recently been implemented in a two - dimensional electron gas in the quantum hall regime with electron motion along edge states.@xcite a discussion which compares the mzi with a second order two - particle interferometer is presented in ref . .",
    "the non - linear behavior of the mzi has received much experimental @xcite and theoretical attention.@xcite in the following we assume that the applied voltages are small and the mzi is operated within its linear response regime.@xcite the mzi coupled to qubits in its arms has the advantage that the two qubits are ( on the mesoscopic scale ) far away from each other .",
    "therefore they are not subject to mutual coulomb interaction .",
    "an additional advantage is that the mzi is tunable both through a variation of the applied magnetic field and through gate voltages .",
    "these gate voltages allow to determine the length of the interferometer arms and to control the transparency of the qpcs which act as beam splitters .",
    "admittedly the fabrication of such a sample is not simple since one of the qubits would have to be built in the interior of the corbino disk . as a consequence",
    "its gates can only be biased with wires which will bridge the conducting region of the interferometer .",
    "our analysis of the parity detection is based on a formulation which takes into account that a quantum measurement lasts a finite time .",
    "this assumes that the detector is only weakly coupled to the system .",
    "such weakly coupled detectors are typical for on chip detectors in mesoscopic physics and have led to a strong theoretical development.@xcite previous works have shown that linearly or quadratically weakly coupled detectors such as qpcs distinguish in general three currents .",
    "their measurement process allow purification of a mixed state and entanglement of the qubits.@xcite in subsequent work trauzettel _",
    "_ @xcite have shown how to use a qpc as a parity detector .",
    "the investigation of entanglement generation finds that the detector still distinguishes three states @xcite , two states which are detectable in repeated measurements belonging to the two parity classes and a time - dependent state which oscillates between the parity classes .",
    "these results follow from a qubit hamiltonian formulated in the @xmath4-basis . in this work",
    "we treat qubits without tunneling and show that the detector can be set to measure only two currents .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe our setup ( see fig .   [ fig1 ] ) . in section iii , we give the conditions for the mzi to operate as parity meter and in section iv , we investigate its heisenberg efficiency .",
    "the efficiency is determined by the ratio of the measurement time of the detector and the dephasing time of the qubits.@xcite we find that a properly tuned mzi parity detector has maximal efficiency , i.e. it is a quantum limited detector . in section v , we show that the measurement performed by the mzi as parity meter entangles the dqds with probability one when each dqd is initially in a superposition state . we also investigate in this last section another interesting property of this parity detection : for this particular class of initial states",
    ", if the odd current is measured , we know into which odd bell state the qubits are driven .",
    "this makes the mzi an efficient parity detector and , for initial superposed states , a deterministic source of entanglement .",
    "the electronic mzi is built in a quantum hall bar by using two qpcs as beam splitters .",
    "the qubits are spatially separated so that they do not interact directly with each other .",
    "the interaction takes place between each qubit and the charges of the corresponding arm and is described with the help of geometrical capacitance coefficients , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : @xmath5 determines the coupling of the charge on the dqd to the charge on the arm , @xmath6 determines the coupling between the dots , and @xmath7 is the capacitance of the dqd to the ground . for simplicity , here , the capacitances are assumed to be the same for each qubit .",
    "the regime of weak coupling between the detector and the dqds is defined by @xmath8 .",
    "additionally , to control the system , we can tune the aharonov - bohm flux , the length of the arms , and the transmission and reflection probabilities of the qpcs .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the mzi .",
    "@xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the qubits .",
    "we assume no tunneling between the dots , @xmath13 , and the same bias for the two dqds , @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 .",
    "the pauli matrices for the upper and lower qubits are @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the interaction hamiltonian",
    "@xmath18 the expressions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the charge operators of the qubits which couple to the charge on the arms of the interferometer .",
    "the mach - zehnder detector considered here is a linear detector in the sense that qubits couple linearly to the charge in the arms of the mzi through the @xmath21 operator .",
    "as the qubit hamiltonian is also in the @xmath22-basis , there is no relaxation process for the dqds due to the coupling with the detector . as shown in more detail in the next section investigating the mzi as parity meter , the parity operator @xmath23 commutes with both @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that , in this configuration , the mach - zehnder detector is a quantum non demolition detector ( qnd - detector ) of the parity classes.@xcite this is to say that repeated measurements will find the qubits in the same parity class , the mzi detects only two stationary currents .",
    "this is an important distinction between previous works on entanglement generation which use a qubit hamiltonian in the @xmath24-basis @xcite and the investigation presented here . to precise @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath25 are the potential operators on the upper and lower arms respectively .",
    "they depend on the bare charge and on the screening charge on the arms due to the presence of the dqds.@xcite this interaction hamiltonian implies that the electrons transiting in the arms of the mzi are sensitive to the charge in the dqds only if this charge is in the dot close to the arm . as a consequence , electrons on arm",
    "@xmath26 will acquire during their transfer a phase @xmath27 due to the magnetic flux , due to the length of the arm @xmath28 and due to the state of the dqds : @xmath29 @xmath30 is the additional phase depending on the state of the dqds and @xmath31 is the magnetic flux between the arms . for simplicity",
    "we consider both arms having the same length @xmath32 and the electrons are sensitive to the dqds over a length @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the fermi wavevector , see fig .",
    "equations  ( [ phase1 ] ) and ( [ phase2 ] ) should be viewed only as abbreviations , since in reality the phases and the transmission probability @xmath35 to be given in the next section are c - numbers depending on the state of the qubits .",
    "thus instead of writing operators in eqs .",
    "( [ phase1 ] ) and ( [ phase2 ] ) we should index these quantities with the corresponding qubit states . here",
    "we avoid such a heavy notation and keep operators .    in the next sections",

    "( [ current_phase_2]-[current_phase_3 ] ) , only one current @xmath48 for the odd states will be measurable if the incremental phases @xmath30 for electrons in upper and lower arms are the same : @xmath51    assuming eq .",

    "although this measurement is not a true parity measurement , it already allows entanglement between the qubits as investigated with a qpc coupled to two dqds.@xcite in our work we want a true parity meter with advantages for the entanglement probabilities as discussed in the next section .",
    "equations  ( [ current_phase_1 ] ) and ( [ current_phase_4 ] ) and fig .  [ current]b show that measuring only one current @xmath49 for the even states is possible if the magnetic flux is set to @xmath54 providing a maximum or minimal transmission . to be specific , in the reminder of the work , we will choose @xmath55 to be at the maximum of transmission .         and",

    "it depends then on the states of the qubits _ only _ through the parity operator @xmath60 : @xmath61    this measurement operator @xmath62 allows parity measurement and the creation of entanglement .",
    "indeed @xmath62 has two eigenvalues @xmath63 of degeneracy 2 , corresponding respectively to the even parity class and to the odd parity class .",

    "these bell states are of particular interest as they share the properties to be the maximal entangled states for two qubits and to have a definite parity .",
    "a key property of the qubit hamiltonian @xmath12 considered in this work is that its dynamics conserves the parity of the bell states : @xmath66 it is the parity measurement in the @xmath21-basis combined with the qubit hamiltonian @xmath12 and the coupling in this @xmath21-basis ( no relaxation process ) that allows the mzi to act as parity meter for the dqds during the entire measurement process . in this sense , this weak measurement procedure is the analog of a qnd measurement of parity classes . + in the next section we will investigate the efficiency of the mzi as parity meter to show that it acts as an ideal detector .",
