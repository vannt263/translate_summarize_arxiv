    "among the most massive and luminous stars in the galaxy @xmath0 carinae is possibly the most enigmatic and intriguing object .",
    "unique features , e.g. variable emissions and the outbursts that occured during the 1800 s , which generated the homunculus - the giant bipolar gas structure surrounding the star - , made difficult the understanding of the real nature of this object .",
    "its periodicity in the observed light curves and spectral lines at all wavelengths indicated its binary nature with @xmath4 years ( damineli 1996 , corcoran et al .",
    "2001 , stahl et al . 2005 ) .    from the x - ray light curve and",
    "spectra it is possible to infer the existence of a strong wind - wind shock , expected for an o - type or wolf - rayet ( wr ) companion star ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ) .",
    "however , since there is no direct observation of the individual stars of the system it is difficult to precisely derive its orbital parameters , e.g. the eccentricity , inclination and periastron position , and indirect methods have to be used .",
    "the periodic variations in the x - ray light curve , which is originated by the wind - wind shocked gas during periastron passage , has already provided some clues on this issue ( corcoran 2005 ) .",
    "similarly , the sharp drop in flux has also been observed at optical ( fernndes - lajs et al .",
    "2008 ) , infrared ( whitelock et al . 2004 ) and radio wavelengths ( duncan & white 2003 , abraham et al .",
    "2005a ) , but with different duration .",
    "corcoran et al . ( 2001 ) assumed that the `` eclipse - like '' dips are produced by increased absorption in the stellar envelope . in this scenario ,",
    "the orbital plane should closely intercept the line of sight and the periastron should be located in opposition regarding the observer .",
    "falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham ( 2005 ) proposed a different scenario , in which the remnant post - shocked gas could increase the optical depth and explain the observed x - ray light curve if the periastron passage is close to conjunction . in a further work , it was also possible to reproduce the radio light curves under this assumption ( abraham et al .",
    "2005b ) . the same process could be invoked to explain the decrease in optical and infrared fluxes .",
    "although x - rays , optical , infrared , and radio light curves may provide clues on the orbit of the system , and even be used on the accurate estimation of the stellar wind properties , it is well known that modelling spectral line profiles is the best method to determine orbital parameters of binary systems , in general , with good precision .",
    "damineli ( 1996 ) , studying the hei@xmath5 , reported a periodicity of 5.5yrs in the spectroscopic events , the epochs in which the line disappear .",
    "steiner & damineli ( 2004 ) studying the higher excitation energy lines of he ii , on the other hand , reported a peak in intensity right before periastron passage .",
    "compared to the x - ray light curve , the similarity reveals that they may have the same origin .",
    "further studies , with higher resolution spectra ( martin et al .",
    "2006 ) , have shown that , not only the line intensities vary within the 5.5yrs period , but also their profiles .",
    "they concluded that the line source might be more complex than simply atmospheric emission , and the decline in flux can not be explained only by eclipsing models .",
    "nielsen et al . ( 2007 ) attempted to explain the line - profiles assuming that the emission is the combination of a major component originated in the stellar wind , and other minor contributions at different velocities , which origin is not clear . from the line velocity curve , they inferred an eccentricity @xmath6 , and that periastron should be placed near opposition .",
    "falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham ( 2007 ) showed that line profile variability is expected from emission originated in the wind - wind interaction zone .",
    "its study showed to be a powerful tool in determining the orbital parameters of wr30a ( falceta - gonalves , abraham & jatenco - pereira 2008 ) , where by fitting synthetic profiles to the observational data , it was possible to determine the inclination and eccentricity of the orbit . also , using the line velocities obtained directly from the primary o - star , it was possible to constrain the stellar masses .",
    "in the @xmath0 carinae binary system , observations of direct and homunculus reflected emission show multi - peaked spectral lines , with profiles and intensities that vary with orbital phase .",
    "stahl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the heii @xmath7  emission lines measured towards the central object and the se lobe of the homunculus presented different profiles , in contradiction to what would be expected assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "abraham & falceta - gonalves ( 2007 ) showed that the conical wind - wind shock region could be the main source of the observed excess in the heii @xmath7  line profiles . to reproduce",
    "both the direct and homunculus reflected line profiles it was necessary to assume that the homunculus axis does not coincide with the axis of the orbital plane .",
    "however , due to the limited amount of data , which were restricted to orbital phases very close to periastron passage , it was not possible to lift the degeneracy regarding the inclination of the orbital and homunculus axis . in all cases , the observed velocity curve , as well as the line profiles , are well reproduced only if periastron occurs near conjunction .",
    "in the present work we extended the analysis of abraham & falceta - gonalves ( 2007 ) , applying this model to the h paschen 8 line reflected by the homunculus se lobe observed by stahl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and derive , for the first time , the orbital and homunculus axis inclination . in section 2",
    "we describe the model and the adopted geometry for the system ; in section 3 we show the results , followed by the conclusions in section 4 .",
    "as the massive and supersonic winds of the two stars collide , they create a wind - wind interaction region , structured as two shocks at both sides of the contact discontinuity where the wind momenta are equal .",
    "as described in luo , mccray & mac - low ( 1990 ) , the geometry of the contact discontinuity is asymptotically conical , with an opening angle @xmath8 given by :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass loss rates and @xmath13 and @xmath14 the wind velocities of the primary and secondary stars , respectively .     regarding the line of sight and @xmath15 regarding the homunculus axis .",
    "it is assumed that the angle between the line of sight and homunculus axis is of @xmath16 ( davidson et al .",
    "2001 , smith et al .",
    "2004).,width=302 ]    at the shock surfaces the compressed gas reaches temperatures of @xmath17k and emits free - free radiation , mostly at x - ray wavelenghts .",
    "as this gas flows along the shock structure , it cools down to recombination temperatures and becomes denser ( abraham et al .",
    "2005a , b ; falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham 2005 ) .",
    "at this stage , it could possibly be the source of he and h lines , explaining some of the features observed in the spectra of massive binary systems ( falceta - gonalves , abraham & jatenco - pereira 2006 , 2007 ) .    the model , proposed in falceta - gonalves et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , considers the emission from each subvolume of the conic shaped shock structure between the stars .",

    "2 , it is possible to obtain synthetic line profiles and compare them to the observations , as it was done with the heii @xmath7  emission line ( abraham & falceta - gonalves 2007 ) . to fit the lines reflected by the homunculus , it is also necessary to take into account the angle between the homunculus axis and the line of sight @xmath26 , and the inclination of the homunculus axis with respect to the orbital plane .    in fig .",
    "1 we describe the geometry of the system as we assumed in the model . here ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath15 represent the inclination of the los and of the homunculus axis with respect to the orbital axis , respectively . in this case , we may write the relationship between these angles as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the angle between the projection of the homunculus axis into the orbital plane and the line of sight . following davidson et al.(2001 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we will consider the angle between the homunculus axis and the los close to @xmath29 .",
    "stahl et al . ( 2005 ) presented vlt / uves observations of the line emission reflected by the se lobe of the homunculus , carried out from december 2002 to march 2004 , or phase interval between 0.9 and 1.127 , including the minimum event of 2003.5 .",
    "the paschen p8 line profile presented strong variability , with clear p cygni absorption , probably related to the stellar wind .",
    "also , in all observations , two prominent excess emission bumps are visible , which we interpreted as extra emission from the shock region .",
    "the digitalized excess emission velocity profiles are shown in figure 2 as filled circles , corrected by the expansion velocity of the homunculus @xmath30 km s@xmath31 .",
    "the numbers at each spectrum represent the date of the observation ( jd - 2.400.000 ) .",
    "the observed peaks reflected by the homunculus pole occurred at @xmath32 km s@xmath31 and @xmath33 km s@xmath31 , while direct observations towards the central star revealed @xmath32 and @xmath34 km s@xmath31 ( weis et al .",
    "this difference shows that , at least part of the observed emission has an anisotropic origin .",
    "we assumed that this latitude dependence is connected to the emission from the conic shock region .",
    ".parameters and input values [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we applied the model described in the section 2 to the observational data . for the wind parameters we used @xmath35 m@xmath36 yr@xmath31 , @xmath37 km s@xmath31 , @xmath38 m@xmath36 yr@xmath31 , @xmath39 km s@xmath31 , which results in @xmath40 and , from eq . 1 , we obtain @xmath41 . for the flow along the conic surface we assumed @xmath42 km s@xmath31 and @xmath43 ( abraham & falceta - gonalves 2007 ) . because of the size of the homunculus , we must also take into account the delay in the light travel from the wind - wind interaction zone to the reflection nebula . the data obtained from the reflection of the expanding nebula corresponds to an emission that occurred in a phase previous than that observed directly towards the central star .",
    "this delay is particularly important for this model because a difference in the phase of the emission corresponds in a difference in the orientation of the shock cone regarding the homunculus and , therefore , a difference shift velocity .",
    "the time delay may be calculated as :    @xmath44    considering an expansion of 100 km s@xmath31 since the outburst about 160 years ago , we get @xmath45 days . therefore , in order to precisely fit the model , we must subtract 20 days in the orbital phase and determine the actual orientation of the shock cone for the given phase angle .",
    "for the determination of the orbital phases we used the epoch of conjunction as june 29 , 2003 ( abraham et al .",
    "2005b ) , @xmath46 and an angle between periastron and conjunction @xmath47 ( abraham & falceta - gonalves 2007 )    in table 1 we show the input parameters of the model and their corresponding values . in the present work the input parameters , shown in table 1 ,",
    "are fixed .",
    "we will briefly discuss the role of each of them on the obtained results later in the paper . finally , we fitted the observational data using eq .",
    "2 , together with eq .",
    "3 , for an optically thin gas ( @xmath48 ) . in falceta - gonalves et",
    "al . ( 2007 ) it has been shown that optically thick wind - wind shocks result in single peaked profiles , while the data of paschen lines of @xmath0 car presented double - peaked profiles at all phases . in order to obtain the best fitting set of values of @xmath21 and @xmath15 , we calculate the synthetic line profiles for the observed epochs for the range @xmath49 to @xmath50 , independently for @xmath21 and @xmath15 , in steps of @xmath51 . the observed data and three of the best models we fitted are shown in fig .",
    "the lines represent the models for different values of @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is noticeable from the modeled spectra that the line profiles are very sensitive to changes in the orbital inclination regarding both the observer and the homunculus .",
    "the best fit , i.e. the minimum cumulative error for all orbital phases , is obtained for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , i.e. an angle between the orbital plane and the line of sight of @xmath54 , in agreement with the radio detection of the almost edge - on gas disk formed around the system .",
    "note that the error of @xmath51 represents the  resolution \" of the sets of @xmath21 and @xmath15 that we have calculated . due to a small degeneracy between @xmath21 and @xmath15 for small values of @xmath55 ,",
    "it is not possible to reduce the imprecision in the determination of these parameters .    the most important issue regarding these results is that the homunculus and the orbital plane axis are not aligned , as usually assumed ( see steiner & damineli 2004 , martin et al .",
    "2006 , okazaki et al 2008 ) . since the homunculus is assumed to be coincident with the stellar rotation axis at the epoch when the outburst event occurred",
    ", we may conclude that the stellar and orbital momenta were not parallel ( or even close to that ) .",
    "considering other massive binary systems , it is well known that the relaxation timescales for close binary systems are short , of order of hundred to a few thousands of years ( e.g. tassoul 1990 ) .",
    "_ should we expect the orbital and stellar angular momenta to coincide after the stellar evolution ( @xmath56 yr ) due to tidal relaxation ? _      close massive binary systems are known to present strong tidal torques ( lecar , wheeler & mckee 1976 ) , which result in i- ) orbital circularization , ii- ) stellar rotation synchronization with the orbital period and iii- ) alignment of stellar and orbital angular momenta .",
    "the last is particularly important considering the results obtained in this work .    to verify the plausibility of a non - aligned orbital and stellar momenta scenario ,",
    "we may estimate the relaxing timescale of the @xmath0 carinae system .",
    "several authors have addressed the problem is the past ( e.g. zahn 1977 , hut 1982 , eggleton , kiseleva & hut 1998 ) . the gravitational pull force acting on each star results in the non - spherical distribution of the stellar mass .",
    "however , since the stars are moving fast in close binaries , the orientation of the tides are not coincident with the direction of the centers of mass .",
    "the extra force component is responsible for the net torque that changes the energy and angular momentum of the orbital motion and stellar rotation .",
    "in particular , hut ( 1982 ) studied the dynamical evolution of close binary systems with high eccentricity due to tidal friction between the two stars - a scenario we believe is correct for @xmath0 carinae . in the case of high eccentricity , and a ratio of rotation to orbital angular momenta @xmath57 ,",
    "the orbital and stellar angular momenta tend to become parallel for timescales of order :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the apsidal motion constant , @xmath60 is the distance between the stars at periastron passage , @xmath61 is the ratio between the stellar masses , @xmath62 , @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath64 is the moment of inertia , @xmath65 the angular velocity and @xmath66 the radius of the primary star ,    @xmath67^{1/2 } d^{-3/2},\\ ] ]    is the orbital angular velocity at periastron , and :    @xmath68    where @xmath24 is the constant time lag of the tidal axis with respect to a coordinate system corotating with the primary star .",
    "the apsidal motion constant @xmath59 depends on the internal structure of the star , and is typically of the order of @xmath69 .    from eqs . 5 - 7",
    "it is clear that the relaxing timescale of the system depends on several poorly known parameters , though an estimation is still possible . for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74s",
    "we have @xmath75s , or @xmath76yr , for @xmath77 . from the parameters used in this estimation ,",
    "the ratio @xmath78 is the main unknown .",
    "typically , we would expect a ratio @xmath79 for a relaxed system , but a ratio @xmath80 for a young wide binary system . in this case",
    ", the relaxation timescale would be even larger and our conclusions unchanged .",
    "typically , the lifetime of stars with @xmath81m@xmath82 is @xmath83 myr",
    "( schaller et al . 1992 ) . therefore , we may conclude that @xmath0 carinae system , during its evolution up to the outburst in the 19th century , had not enough time to relax , and we should not expect the orbital and rotation angular momenta to be aligned .",
    "interestingly , this also reveals that the orbital high eccentricity ( @xmath84 ) may be primordial , even though it could also be a result of the massive mass ejection events .",
    "although many authors agree about the binary nature of @xmath0 carinae , its orbital parameters and orientation are still poorly known . from the x - ray and radio light curves , as well as the spectral line velocity curves , it is possible to derive high eccentricity ( @xmath84 ) ( ishibashi et al .",
    "1999 , abraham et al .",
    "2005b , falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham 2005 ) .",
    "also , from the spectral line profiles it was believed that the periastron should happen in opposition to the observer , with @xmath85 , if one assumes that the emission comes exclusively from the stellar winds ( davidson 1997 , nielsen et al .",
    "abraham & falceta - gonalves ( 2007 ) showed that the wind - wind shock region can be responsible for the heii4686 emission excess , and consistently fit the observed spectra .",
    "however , in this case the periastron should occur near conjunction instead ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "regarding the orbital inclination , it is commonly assumed that the orbital plane should be nearly aligned with the homunculus equator ( davidson 1997 , smith et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is inclined @xmath87 with respect to the observer . in contradiction to that",
    ", high resolution radio observations show the presence of a gas torus surrounding the system , which seems to be seen edge - on ( duncan & white 2003 ) , indicating that the orbit may not be aligned with the homunculus . in this scenario",
    ", the torus would also be responsible for the shell - like effect seen in the x - ray light curve ( falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham 2005 ) .    in this work we studied the possibility of the orbital plane and the homunculus not being aligned . for that",
    ", we used the hydrogen paschen 8 line spectral profiles obtained from the se lobe of the homunculus .",
    "this line is supposed to originate in the central system and reflected by the expanding gas .",
    "the observed excess flux presented two peaked line profiles , which velocities change with the orbital phases .",
    "this behaviour is common in massive binary systems where the line emission originates in the wind - wind interaction zone",
    ". the conical shock surface would be resposible for an anomalous two peaked profile with velocities changing during the orbital period as the line of sight is intercepted by different vector projections of the flowing gas , as detailed in falceta - gonalves , abraham & jatenco - pereira ( 2006 ) .",
    "we applied the synthetic line profile model , considering the emission from the central system , and derived the reflected fluxes at the se lobe of the homunculus .",
    "we fixed the stellar and orbital parameters @xmath88 , @xmath46 , @xmath42 km s@xmath31 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( abraham & falceta - gonalves 2007 ) , and left the orbital inclination regarding the line of sight ( @xmath21 ) and regarding the homunculus axis ( @xmath15 ) as fit parameters .",
    "we showed that the line profiles are very sensitive to changes in the orbital inclination regarding both the observer and the homunculus axis .",
    "therefore , this method has revealed helpful in constraining the orbital orientation of the system .",
    "the best fit was obtained for @xmath91 and @xmath52 .",
    "this result shows that the line of sight must lie close to the orbital plane ( @xmath92 ) , as indicated by radio observations and theoretical models regarding the x - ray light curve .    in the presented calculations ,",
    "most of the orbital and stellar parameters were fixed , based on previous references ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is important though to understand if changes in any of these would reflect in major changes on our results and conclusions .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit is a well - known parameter as it is constrained by the velocity curves of several spectral lines - we should expect its value to vary within the range @xmath93 .",
    "a different eccentricity would simply change the orbital phase , in which a given synthetic line would fit the data , therefore being irrelevant for the synthetic profiles .",
    "the same occurs for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "actually , @xmath94 is also related to the curvature of the shock cone . the turbulence amplitude @xmath23 , on the other hand , is responsible for the broadness of the synthetic line profiles .",
    "since the observed broadness for each peak is unchanged at different orbital phases , its value is also irrelevant on the determination of @xmath21 and @xmath15 . it is important though to remember that @xmath23 presents a degeneracy with @xmath98 , i.e. if the system has a smaller value of @xmath98 , we would need a larger value of @xmath23 to account for the same line broadness being @xmath99 directly obtained from the observed line velocities , but it has no influence on the determination of the inclination of the orbital plane . among the fixed parameters ,",
    "@xmath8 is the only strongly correlated with @xmath21 and @xmath15 . as fully discussed in falceta - gonalves et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , a sequence of synthetic profiles may be well reproduced if an increased value of @xmath8 is balanced by a decrease of @xmath21 , regarding the line of sight . however , considering the observed profiles , this degeneracy is limited to the range in which @xmath100 because , otherwise , models with @xmath101 result in single peaked profiles in certain orbital phases .",
    "since the observational data presents two - peaked profiles in all phases we may constrain @xmath100 . fortunately , @xmath8 depends on the stellar winds of the two stars , which are approximately well constrained to provide @xmath102 .",
    "this range of possible @xmath8 values is coherent with the obtained range of @xmath103 , regarding the line of sight .    also , the results show that the homunculus axis is not perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "this suggests that the stellar angular momentum , probably coincident with the homunculus axis , is not aligned with the orbital motion .",
    "we explained this fact showing that the relaxing timescale for momenta alignment and orbital circularization of @xmath0 carinae is longer than the stellar lifetime .",
    "this fact also explains the high eccentricity of the system ( @xmath104 ) , since tidal interactions did not have enough time to circularize the orbit .",
    "it is true though that the outburst occured in the 19th century could have been responsible for large changes in the orbital parameters as well .",
    "finally , direct observations toward the central star revealed an increase in p cygni absorption during the minimum ( davidson et al .",
    "2005 ) , as opposed to the polar data , which shows almost constant absorption .",
    "this fact tell us that the main responsible for this absorption is not the primary star wind but , if the orbital plane is close to the los , the secondary star wind or the remaining post - shocked gas within the star and the observer .",
