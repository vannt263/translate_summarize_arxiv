    "instanton - induced processes in the standard electroweak theory are known to lead to baryon and lepton number violation .",
    "although t hooft @xcite showed several years ago that such phenomena are utterly suppressed by the factor @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the @xmath2 gauge coupling constant ) , several authors @xcite explored the possibility that this exponential suppression factor can be overcome at high energies by the phase space which corresponds to multiparticle production .",
    "the key observation is that the @xmath3- instanton induces to leading semiclassical approximation effective point - like interactions which involve all the fermionic left - handed @xmath2-doublets of the theory ( four per generation ) and any number of higgs and gauge bosons .",
    "the inclusive cross section of the baryon and lepton number violating two fermion scattering can then be calculated as the imaginary part of the forward @xmath4 scattering amplitude depicted in fig.1 @xcite . as a result",
    ", this inclusive cross section appears to grow exponentially with energy and can conceivably become unsuppressed at energies of the order of the sphaleron @xcite mass .",
    "this leading order behavior may , however , be drastically altered by higher order corrections well before the energy reaches the sphaleron mass and consequently , these phenomena may remain unobservable at all energies .",
    "several authors @xcite actually , have suggested that this could be the case if multiinstanton corrections were to be taken into account .",
    "corrections to the @xmath4 scattering amplitude consisting of linear instanton - antiinstanton chains in alternating order were considered , with particle exchange allowed only between successive instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "dorey and mattis @xcite , however , using the valley method @xcite , pointed out that inclusion of non - nearest neighbor instanton - antiinstanton as well as instanton - instanton and antiinstanton - antiinstanton interactions could render these chain graphs unimportant at the relevant energies .",
    "this , however , may not happen if dorey s result on the non linear @xmath5 @xmath6model applies in the realistic case too .",
    "the imaginary part of the chain graphs being ultraviolately divergent , requires the introduction of an appropriate cut - off .",
    "finally , these graphs do not include initial state corrections and thus , are not expected to alter the high energy behavior of the leading semiclassical approximation @xcite,@xcite .    in this work",
    "we choose to deal with a class of ladder graphs shown in fig.2 .",
    "the imaginary part of these graphs turns out to be finite and can , in principle , be unambiguously calculated .",
    "they can , in some sense , be thought as including initial state corrections too since the incoming particles enter in different instanton vertices .",
    "in addition , such ladder graphs are known to dominate the high - energy behavior in ordinary field theories.we should emphasize , however , that including the ladder graphs of fig.2 does not solve the problem of initial state corrections . indeed",
    ", the entire picture of separated instanton - antiinstanton chains is an uncontrolled approximation at energies where such chains actually become important .",
    "consider the inclusive cross section , @xmath7 , of the b and l violating reaction @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of fermion generations ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent quarks and leptons respectively and we have ignored for simplicity the production of gauge particles . in the leading instanton approximation , @xmath13 can be determined by first calculating the forward @xmath14 scattering amplitude in euclidean space as shown in fig.1 .",
    "then , @xmath7 is given by the imaginary part acquired by this amplitude after rotating the total incoming euclidean particle momentum @xmath15 to minkowski space @xmath16 .",
    "the expression corresponding to the euclidean space forward scattering amplitude is @xcite,@xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 is a constant given by @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the scale sizes of the instanton and the antiinstanton , @xmath22 is their euclidean separation , @xmath23 the electroweak breaking scale , g the gauge coupling and @xmath24 is the renormalization point .",
    "the function @xmath25 , to leading semiclassical order ( or for @xmath26 ) , can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the exponential factor in the formula above , corresponds to the higgses in the final state of reaction ( 1 ) , whereas the second factor corresponds to the @xmath30 fermions which are also being produced .",
    "since we are interested in the high energy behavior of @xmath7 , we can assume throughout this work that all fermions and higgs bosons are effectively massless .",
    "we will first consider the integral over the instanton - antiinstanton separation @xmath31 this integral converges at infinity for @xmath32 , but diverges badly at @xmath33 .",
    "this virulent ultraviolet divergence in euclidean space is due to the attractive nature of the coulomb potential @xmath34 resulting from higgs particle exchange between the instanton and the antiinstanton and is an artifact of the leading semiclassical approximation .",
    "we , thus , define a regularized integral @xmath35 by removing from the range of integration a four - dimensional disc of finite radius @xmath36 centered at the origin . performing the angular integrations",
    ", we obtain @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the well - known meijer function .",
    "the contour @xmath39 is a loop starting and ending at @xmath40 and encircling the poles of @xmath41 once in the negative direction . since @xmath42 is positive",
    ", one can show that the contour @xmath39 can be distorted to become parallel to the imaginary axis and lying in the strip @xmath43 . then substituting eq.(8 ) in eq.(7 ) and interchanging the order of integrations",

    "we will now turn to the calculation of the euclidean space ladder graphs shown in fig.2 .",
    "the graphs , after rotating @xmath67 and taking the imaginary part , constitute an important class of multiinstanton corrections to the leading semiclassical approximation of @xmath13 . the forward scattering amplitude which corresponds to the ladder graph with @xmath68 rungs @xmath69",
