    "social norms are the basis of a community . they are often adopted and respected even if in contrast with an agent s immediate advantage , or , alternatively , even if they are costly with respect to a naive behavior .",
    "indeed , the social pressure towards a widespread social norm is sometimes more powerful than a norm imposed by punishments .",
    "it is well known that the establishment of social norms is a difficult task and their imposition is not always fulfilled .",
    "this problem has been affronted by axelrod in a game - theoretic formulation  @xcite , as the foundation of the cooperation and of the society itself .",
    "axelrod s idea is that of a repeated game .",
    "although in a one - shot game it is always profitable to win not following any norm , in a repeated game there might be several reasons for cooperation  @xcite , the most common ones are direct reciprocity and reputation . in all these games ,",
    "the crucial parameters are the cost of cooperation with respect to defeat , and the expected number of re - encounters with one s opponent or the probability that one s behavior will become public .",
    "one can assume that these aspects are related to the size of the local community with which one interacts and the fraction of people in this community that share the acceptance of the social norm .",
    "indeed , the behavior of a spatial social game is strongly influenced by the network structure  @xcite .    in the presence of a social norm",
    ", people can manifest a conformist or a non conformist or contrarian attitude , characterized by the propensity to agree or disagree with the average opinion in their neighborhood .",
    "contrarian agents were first discussed in the field of finance  @xcite and later in opinion formation models  @xcite .",
    "contrarian behavior may have an advantage in financial investment .",
    "financial contrarians look for mispriced investments , buying those that appear to be undervalued by the market and selling those that are overpriced . in opinion formation models , contrarians gather the average opinion of their neighbors and choose the opposite one .",
    "reasonable contrarians do not violate social norms , _",
    "i.e. _ , they agree with conformists if the majority of neighbors is above a certain threshold .    models of social dynamics have been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we model the dynamics of a homogeneous community with different degrees of reasonable contrarianism .",
    "one of the main motivations for this study is that of exploring the possible behavior of autonomous agents employed in algorithmic trading in an electronic market .",
    "virtually all markets are now electronic  @xcite and the speed of transaction require the use of automatic agents ( algorithmic trading )  @xcite",
    ". our study can be consider as an exploration of possible collective effects in a homogeneous automatic market .",
    "we consider a simplified cellular automaton model  @xcite .",
    "each agent can have one of two opinions at time @xmath0 , and we study the parallel evolution of such agents , which can be seen also as a spin system .",
    "a society of conformists can be modeled as a ferromagnet and one of contrarians as an antiferromagnet .",
    "each agent changes his opinion according to the local social pressure or what is the same , the average opinion of his neighbors . in spin",

    ", each agent changes its opinion according to a transition probability that takes into account the average opinion of his neighbors , that is , the local social pressure and the adherence to social norms .",
    "the neighborhoods are fixed in time .",
    "the transition probability depends on a parameter @xmath2 , analogous to the spin coupling in the ising model , which is positive for a society of conformists ( ferromagnet ) and negative for one of contrarians ( antiferromagnet ) .",
    "for a one dimensional society where the neighborhood of each agent includes its first @xmath3 nearest neighbors , @xmath3 is the connectivity , the average opinion fluctuates around the value 1/2 , regardless of the values of the parameters of the transition probability .",
    "simulations of the one - dimensional version of the model show irregular fluctuations at the microscopic level , with short range correlations  @xcite .",

    "the well - stirred assumption is often not sustainable from the experimental point of view .",
    "however , it may well be that there is a small fraction of long - range interactions ( or jumps ) , that might justify the small - world effect .",
