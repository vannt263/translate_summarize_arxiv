    "an accurate definition of the redshift distribution of radio sources at faint flux densities has become particularly important in the last decade for both radio astronomy and cosmology .",
    "it is critical , for example , in testing radio - source unification ( e.g. jackson & wall , 1998 ) , and in large - scale structure studies ( e.g. loan et al .",
    "1997 , magliocchetti et al .",
    "1999 ) to permit the conversion of angular clustering estimates to the spatial clustering estimates required to evaluate structure formation models .",
    "classical large - scale - structure studies have used wide - area optical and ir surveys to measure the clustering of galaxies , but these are limited to low redshifts , with a peak redshift selection of @xmath11 ( e.g. apm , maddox et al . , 1990 ; iras , fisher et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "deep small - area surveys such as the hubble deep field north ( williams et al . , 1996 ) or",
    "the cfrs survey ( lilly et al . , 1995 ) have been used to measure clustering to much higher redshifts ( see e.g. le fevre et al . , 1995 ; magliocchetti & maddox , 1998 ) ,",
    "but they probe small volumes and can measure clustering only on small scales ( @xmath12 mpc ) . on the other hand radio objects are detected to high redshifts ( @xmath13 ) and sample a much larger volume for a given number of galaxies , so that they have the potential to provide information on the growth of structure on large physical scales .",
    "recently , clustering statistics in deep radio surveys have been measured ( cress et al . , 1997 ; loan et al . , 1997 ;",
    "baleisis et al . , 1997 ; magliocchetti et al . ,",
    "1998 ) and these analyses have shown radio sources to be reliable tracers of the mass distribution , even though they may be biased ( magliochetti et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "however the relationship between angular measurements and the physically meaningful spatial quantities is highly uncertain without an accurate estimate of the redshift distribution of radio objects @xmath7 ( magliocchetti et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the current estimates of @xmath7 for radio sources at mjy levels are largely based on predictions from the local radio luminosity functions and evolution ( see e.g. dunlop & peacock , 1990 ) , and are poorly defined .",
    "indeed the predictions require the knowledge of more than one luminosity function .",
    "deep radio surveys ( condon & mitchell , 1984 ; windhorst et al . , 1985 ; fomalont et al . ,",
    "1993 ) have shown a flattening of the differential source count @xmath14 below s @xmath15 mjy .",
    "this flattening is generally interpreted as due to the presence of a population of radio sources differing from the radio agn which dominate at higher flux densities .",
    "condon ( 1984 ) suggested a population of strongly - evolving normal spiral galaxies , while others ( windhorst et al .",
    ", 1985 ; danese et al . , 1987 ) claimed the presence of an actively star - forming galaxy population .",
    "observations supported this latter suggestion ; the identifications of many of the faint sources are with galaxies with spectroscopic and photometric properties similar to ` iras galaxies ' ( franceschini et al . , 1988 ; benn et al . ,",
    "the model predictions of @xmath7 at faint flux densities from the luminosity functions of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) diverge greatly because of inadequate definition of the radio agn luminosity functions ; but in addition the contribution to @xmath7 of the starburst population needs consideration . in order to define @xmath7 and the population mix at mjy levels ,",
    "we have observed radio sources from the first survey ( becker et al . , 1995 ) using the wyffos multi - object spectrograph on the william herschel telescope in 8 1-degree diameter fields .",
    "we show how these observations constrain both the form of @xmath7 and the population mix at s @xmath10  mjy for @xmath16 .",
    "section 2 of the paper introduces this radio sample , while sections 3 and 4 describe acquisition and reduction of the data . in sections 5 , 6 and 7 we present the radio , spectroscopic and photometric properties of the sample .",
    "section 8 is devoted to the analysis of the observed @xmath7 and comparison with models ; the conclusions are in section 9 .",
    "the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ) survey ( becker , white and helfand , 1995 ) began in the spring of 1993 and will eventually cover some 10,000 square degrees of the sky in the north galactic cap and equatorial zones . the vla is being used in b - configuration to take 3-min snapshots of 23.5-arcmin fields arranged on a hexagonal grid .",
    "the beam - size is 5.4  arcsec at 1.4  ghz , with an rms sensitivity of typically 0.14  mjy / beam .",
    "a map is produced for each field and sources are detected using an elliptical gaussian fitting procedure ( white et al . , 1997 ) ; the @xmath17 source detection limit is @xmath181  mjy .",
    "the surface density of objects in the catalogue is @xmath19 per square degree , though this is reduced to @xmath20 per square degree if we combine multi - component sources ( magliocchetti et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the depth , uniformity and angular extent of the survey are excellent attributes for investigating the clustering properties of faint sources .",
    "we used the 4 april 1998 version of the catalogue which contains approximately 437,000 sources and is derived from the 1993 through 1997 observations covering nearly 5000 square degrees of sky , including most of the area @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "this catalogue has been estimated to be 95 per cent complete at 2  mjy and 80 per cent complete at 1  mjy ( becker et al . ,  1995 ) .",
    "for the purpose of determining the redshift distribution , the precise position of the fields is not crucial , although several factors were taken into account when choosing which to observe .",
    "the fields must span a range of ra s to ensure they could be observed at low zenith distance throughout the allocated nights .",
    "the fields are at as high galactic latitude as possible to reduce the probability of confused optical identifications and to ensure low galactic extinction ( the allocated time meant the fields had to be on opposite sides of the galactic plane ) .",
    "we also cross - checked with fields which will be observed as part of the int wide - field camera survey , and chose our fields to overlap with these , so that deep optical images will be available in the near future .    these constraints lead to the choice of three main areas : @xmath25 ( which covers the iso elais field ) ; @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we also observed a field adjacent to the elais field , and one on each side of the @xmath26 , and @xmath28 fields .",
    "the areas actually observed are shown in figure [ fig : fields ] , and the field centres are listed in table  [ table_fields ] .",
    "the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) has a prime - focus corrector with an atmospheric - dispersion compensator that provides a field of view of one degree in diameter .",
    "autofib2 is a robotic positioner , which places up to 120 optical fibre feeds in the focal plane , each fibre collecting light from a @xmath29 diameter patch of sky .",
    "the fibres are fed to wyffos which is a multi - object spectrograph , at one of the wht nasmyth foci .",
    "the spectrograph can use a range of gratings offering 30 - 500  / mm dispersion .",
    "we chose to use the 600 lines / mm grating with the tek1024@xmath30 ccd , which gives a dispersion of @xmath31   per pixel , and a resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "for a central wavelength at 6000  this set up gives spectra from @xmath32to @xmath33 .",
    "the fibres on wyfoss cover 2.7 arcsecs on the sky , but to obtain the best throughput , they must be positioned to an accuracy of @xmath34 or better .",
    "the astrometric reference frame of the first survey is accurate to @xmath35 , and individual sources have 90% confidence error circles of radius @xmath36 at the 3 mjy level and @xmath37 at the survey threshold .",
    "this means that , in principle , the radio source positions are accurate enough to position the fibres , even without optically identified counterparts . using the radio positions",
    "means that our sample is not biased towards optically bright sources .",
    "although our spectroscopy will clearly be limited by the optical brightness , it should be possible to obtain redshifts for any sources that have strong optical emission lines but very faint continuum .",
    "these sources would have been rejected from the sample if we required every target to have an optical counterpart .",
    "however there are a few complications in using the radio positions and these must be taken into account .",
    "first , the telescope must be positioned and guided using fiducial stars .",
    "we selected stars with @xmath38 from apm scans of ukst plates for the equatorial fields , and of poss2 plates for the elais fields .",
    "these star positions are accurate to about @xmath39 , but have been measured in an optical reference frame , which may be offset from the radio reference frame by more than an arcsecond .",
    "therefore we matched up the radio sources and optical images for each schmidt plate .",
    "figure  [ fig_astrom ] shows a typical plot of the positional residuals between the optical and radio positions . there is a uniform background of points with residuals greater than @xmath40 , which come from random coincidences between optical and radio sources .",
    "the true optical identifications show up as the concentration of points near zero offset .",
    "the mean positional offset of the identifications is @xmath41 in ra and @xmath34 in dec , corresponding to the offset between the optical and radio astrometric frames , and this offset was applied to each position in the elais field so that the optical and radio astrometry coincide .",
    "similar offsets were calculated for each of the other observed fields .",
    "the scatter in residuals about the mean offset is about @xmath34 which is consistent with the quoted positional accuracy of the surveys .",
    "the second complication is that the optical i d of an extended radiosource will not necessarily lie at the radio catalogue position . in the case of a classical double - lobed radiosource , the radio core and optical i d will lie between the lobes , which themselves may be catalogued as two separate radio sources . in the case of a core - jet radiosource ,",
    "the radio core and optical i d will usually lie away from the centroid of the radio emission . to address this problem",
    ", we extracted @xmath42 radio maps from the first database and optical images covering a similar area from the digital sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "we visually inspected each of the radio maps , and overlaid the optical contours so that we could identify possible offsets between the radio and optical emission .",
    "almost all of the radiosources were either unresolved or dominated by an unresolved component in the first maps . only in a few cases it was necessary to manually adjust the positions .",
    "a typical plot showing the first radio map and overlaid optical contours is shown in figure  [ fig_radio_optmap ] .    as well as the fiducial stars and target objects ,",
    "it is necessary to observe some regions of blank sky , so that the sky spectrum during the observations can be estimated and subtracted from the target spectra . on average",
    "there are 70 radio sources per field ( see table  [ table_fields ] ) , leaving 50 fibres which could be used for sky .",
    "two sets of sky positions were generated for each field .",
    "the first set were the target positions in the focal plane when the telescope is offset by 5 arcminutes in dec .",
    "note that the spherical geometry of the sky means that new positions do not exactly correspond to a simple addition of 5 arcmins to each dec .",
    "the low surface density of bright optical images meant that these positions were blank sky for all but a couple of cases .",
    "the second set were simply randomly chosen positions ; again most of these are blank sky . given the large number of sky fibres",
    "we could median them together to obtain a highly accurate estimate of the true sky spectrum , even if a few were contaminated by objects .",
    "each fibre for autofib2 can be placed within a restricted area defined by a maximum radial extension and a maximum tilt angle from the radial direction .",
    "also no fibre can cross another , and there must be a small buffer - zone around each fibre . these constraints",
    "limit the number of targets that can be allocated to a fibre within a particular field .",
    "the program configure is part of the wyffos software package , and it attempts to find the most efficient set of target - to - fibre allocations .",
    "this configuration was then inspected and some changes were made manually to increase the number of fibres allocated to targets .",
    "a typical configuration is shown in figure  [ fig_configure ] .",
    "the total number of targets and number of fibres allocated is shown in table  [ table_fields ] .",

    "the solid line is for all the objects , while the dashed line is the distribution obtained by imposing the further constraint r @xmath55 , the limiting magnitude for the completeness of our sample .",
    "the @xmath7 distribution from the phoenix sample is dominated by two peaks at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , presumably due to two major galaxy concentrations .",
    "these features , together with the exceptional field - to - field variations which occur in the wht sample show how seriously large - scale structures affect deep radio surveys .",
    "an @xmath7 determination requires as many independent areas as possible ; and to this end we have no hesitation in joining our sample with the phoenix sample to make such a determination .",
    "we must consider the factors affecting the redshift completeness of the samples before comparing to model predictions .",
    "for the phoenix survey the completeness down to 0.4 mjy is @xmath58 in the shallower region , so we expect that it is essentially complete to @xmath59 mjy .",
    "thus incompleteness in the spectroscopic sample comes only from the limiting magnitude r=22.5 which restricts identification and spectroscopy to 47 per cent of the sample .",
    "the wht sample has three types of incompleteness :    * * incompleteness in the radio catalogue . *",
    "becker , white & helfand ( 1995 ) estimated the catalogue obtained from the first survey to be 80  per  cent complete down to a flux density of 1  mjy .",
    "the issue is how this incompleteness affects the population mix in that compact sources at 1  mjy will be present , while resolution will preferentially lose sources of extended structure .",
    "paradoxically this is more of a problem for agn and as these have been excised from our sample by virtue of their high redshifts , this issue may be of no significance .",
    "starburst galaxies have relatively compact structures ( richards , 1999 ) so that the resolution effects of a 5  arcsec beam will not be serious . * * incompleteness in the acquisition of the spectroscopic data .",
    "* not all the catalogued radio - source positions in the 8 fields observed had a fibre placed on them ( section  3 and figures  [ fig : fields ] and 4 ) .",
    "this was due ( 1 ) the geometry of the wyffos spectrograph , and ( 2 ) the issue of multi - component objects ( see magliocchetti et al . , 1998 ) affecting @xmath15  per  cent of the whole sample .",
    "in these ( recognised ) cases the fibre was placed at the mid - point of the double / triple source . * * incompleteness in redshift determination .",
    "* several poorly - defined factors are involved .",
    "for instance , as the sample was selected on the basis of radio flux alone , the process of redshift determination is biased against intrinsically dusty sources ; but this same bias applies to the phoenix sample .",
    "intergalactic dust screening could also be involved ; see section  6.3 regarding field - to field variation .",
    "+ figure [ fig : hist_flux ] compares the number of sources in the whole spectroscopic sample per radio flux interval with the relative distribution obtained for the sub - sample with measured redshifts ( hereafter , the ` @xmath43-sample ' ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath60  per  cent between the samples stays approximately constant with s , at least up to s @xmath61  mjy , at which point the number of objects in the samples becomes too small to make a meaningful comparison .",
    "+ the constancy of the @xmath62 ratio in figure 12 implies that there is no radio flux - bias in the process of @xmath43 determination .",
    "thus a reasonable supposition is that incompleteness in the radio survey ( resolution in particular ) does not seriously affect the population mix of the @xmath43-sample .",
    "we therefore suggest that apart from the known incompleteness due to fibre coverage , the optical flux is the prime cause of incompleteness . though we have not explicitly imposed a magnitude limit , the redshifts require adequate signal - to - noise in the optical spectra . for non - emission line galaxies ,",
    "this effectively means a completeness in the continuum magnitude limit , which , as seen in figure  [ fig : mags_flux ] , corresponds to r @xmath63  mag . using the r-@xmath43 relationship of figure  [ fig : mags_flux ] and equation ( 1 ) , for a value of r @xmath63",
    ", the @xmath43-sample ( which only includes objects with radio fluxes @xmath64 mjy ) is complete in redshift up to @xmath65 .",
    "the uncertainty corresponds to the scatter in the r-@xmath43 relation .",
    "the procedure can not be applied to seyfert1 objects , which do not follow the @xmath66 relation .",
    "however our conclusions are not affected given that this class of objects is mainly found at redshifts @xmath67 . + as a further test , figure  [ fig : n_zp ] shows the variation in the @xmath7 for the phoenix survey if we consider a magnitude cut of r=18.6 ( dashed line ) . the number of sources per redshift is unaffected to @xmath68 .",
    "the percentage then starts dropping as the r=18.6 magnitude limit comes into play . from a similar analysis using our r-@xmath43 relation",
    ", we find that the phoenix survey sample is essentially complete to @xmath69 for objects other than radio agn .",
    "the @xmath7 model predictions used here are from the study by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ; hereafter dp ) in which maximum entropy analysis was used to determine the coefficients of polynomial expansions representing the epoch - dependent radio luminosity functions of radio agns .",
    "the analysis incorporated the then - available identification and redshift data for complete samples from radio surveys at several frequencies . indeed",
    "the 7 derivations of luminosity functions carried out by dp predict source counts and @xmath7 distributions for frequencies 150  mhz to 5  ghz down to 100  mjy with considerable accuracy , the input data spanning approximately this parameter space .",
    "however , extrapolating down to mjy levels , the models show large variations in the predicted @xmath7 ; see figure 1 of magliocchetti et al .",
    "nevertheless , all predictions show a broad peak with median redshift of about 1 .",
    "some models also produce a spike at small redshifts indicating that at such low flux densities , the lowest - power tail of the local radio luminosity function begins to contribute substantial numbers of low - redshift sources .",
    "note that the dp formulation did not encompass any evolving starburst - galaxy population explicitly ; it was restricted to two radio agn populations , the steep - spectrum extended - structure ( fri and frii ) objects and the flat spectrum , compact objects ( predominantly seyfert1/quasars and bllacs ) .",
    "hence , at some level , the low-@xmath43 spike must be considered as a fortunate artifact of the models .    to compare the predictions from dp models with the data we have to consider the incompleteness effects described above . with regard to normalization of surface density , the dp predictions give @xmath70 for an area of @xmath71 square degrees . for our 8 chosen fields of the first survey",

    "the shaded area corresponds to the redshift range @xmath73 where the combined sample starts losing completeness due to magnitude incompleteness in the wht sample .",
    "the smooth curves are the predictions from dp models .",
    "none of these provides a good fit .",
    "the percentage of objects at @xmath74 is seriously overestimated in all the models , especially 6 and 7 that feature an unrealistic @xmath75 spike , presumably an artifact caused by extrapolating too far .",
    "though the uncertainties are large , only one model ( model 3 ) roughly follows the steady rise in @xmath7 to @xmath76 , while all the others either show a plateau or decrease for @xmath77 .",
    "note that model 3 is also the closest to the correct low-@xmath43 normalisation .",
    "our data show that the population of starburst galaxies constitutes only a small fraction of the radio objects at the mjy level , contrary to early claims ( e.g. windhorst et al . , 1985 ) .",
    "if the majority of objects at radio fluxes 1  mjy  @xmath78  mjy were starburst galaxies we would have obtained redshifts for all of them .",
    "in fact such objects are on average the brightest in apparent magnitude and the closest in the @xmath43-sample ( see also benn et al . , 1993 ; gruppioni , mignoli & zamorani , 1998 ; georgakakis et al . , 1999 ) . allowing for the sensitivity limit of our redshift determinations , and the strong emission line spectrum for this type of objects we would expect @xmath18100  per  cent redshift completeness up to @xmath76 .",
    "if indeed they constituted most of the sources at 1  mjy , we would have therefore found a ratio @xmath62 to be @xmath10 at low radio fluxes .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_flux ] shows that this is not the case ; all flux intervals have the similar probability ( @xmath79  per  cent ) of redshift determination .",
    "thus only @xmath80  per  cent of the population at s@xmath81 = 1  mjy can be starburst objects ; the great majority of identifications remain agn , with predominantly early - type galaxies as hosts , too faint in optical magnitude to be detected in our spectroscopic observations .",
    "very similar conclusions are reached by gruppioni , mignoli & zamorani , 1998 and georgakakis et al .",
    ", 1999 for their mjy / sub - mjy samples , in which the optical observations were pushed down to r=24 and r=22.5 magnitudes respectively .",
    "we stress again that we did not impose a magnitude limit before our spectroscopic observations , so that any optically - faint star - forming galaxies would have been observed in our sample .",
    "the presence of emission lines would have allowed us to get redshifts for those sources much fainter than the apm survey magnitude limit .",
    "however , we found that that for r @xmath82 the only classes of objects detected were early - type and seyfert1 galaxies .",
    "this makes the constraint on the percentage of star - bursting galaxies at mjy level yet more robust .",
    "we note that our determination of @xmath7 at low @xmath43 provides an additional datum on the shape of the complete @xmath7 distribution .",
    "the overall normalisations between our sample and the dp predictions agree ; yet the dp predictions significantly overestimate @xmath7 at @xmath83 .",
    "this disagreement at low redshifts may imply that we expect to find many more sources at @xmath84 , perhaps consistent with the dp model 3 .",
    "however there is a significant uncertainty caused by the large variation in fraction of optically identified sources in different 1 degree wht fields ( the fraction varies by a factor 4 , see table  [ table_fields ] ) .",
    "the combined phoenix and wht samples are equivalent to roughly 10 times the area of one wht field , so assuming poisson statistics we expect roughly a factor 1.5 uncertainty in the overall surface density . allowing for such variations , any of the dp models 1 - 4 too are reasonably consistent with the data .",
    "we have carried out multi - object spectroscopy of an unbiased selection of first radio sources ( s @xmath85  mjy ) by placing fibres at the positions of 365 sources ( @xmath18 69  per  cent of the complete radio sample ) .",
    "the spectra obtained have enabled us to measure 46 redshifts , @xmath79  per  cent of the targeted objects .",
    "apm data have provided morphology and photometric data for the corresponding optical identifications .",
    "the photometry shows that redshift measurements were obtained only for objects brighter than r @xmath86  mag ; from the tight r-@xmath43 relation observed , the redshift sample is estimated to be @xmath18100  per  cent complete to r=18.6  mag .",
    "the objects in the spectroscopic sample with r @xmath87 are a mixture of early - type galaxies at relatively high redshifts , @xmath88 ( @xmath89  per  cent of the sample ) , late - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts , @xmath90 ( @xmath91  per  cent ) , and very local starburst galaxies with @xmath5 ( @xmath4  per  cent ) .",

    "this disagreement may imply that the model shape is wrong , and there are more sources at @xmath84 than indicated by the models .",
    "alternatively , the discrepancy could be due to observing a low density by chance , given a large variance in galaxy density caused by strong clustering . *",
    "the @xmath7 at @xmath100  mjy is dominated by agn , and starburst objects constitute less than 5  per  cent of the total .",
    "this is a robust conclusion .",
    "more starburst galaxies would have substantially raised the proportion of objects with redshift determinations ; and a significant intrusion of starburst galaxies at the lowest radio flux densities would have resulted in a higher success rate in redshift determination with decreasing flux density .",
    "the great majority of objects in the sample at this level are agn associated with early - type galaxies whose optical continua and weak - to non - existent emission lines place them at or below the limit of our spectroscopic survey .",
    "the accurate definition of the low@xmath101 end of the @xmath7 relation has impact in four areas : ( i ) the population mix , which is critical for testing and refining dual - population unified models ; ( ii ) the definition of the local luminosity functions , important for modelling both the form and cosmic evolution of the overall luminosity functions ; ( iii ) the derivation of spatial measurements of the large - scale structure from angular measurements ; and ( iv ) constraints which it enables to be placed on the global star - formation - rate up to @xmath98 .",
