    "quantum chromodynamics predicts [ 1]a phase transition from a deconfined to a confined matter of hadrons during the early stages of the universe . just in the beginning of the universe",
    "it was considered to be in the form of deconfined matter of quarks and gluons and subsequent process of cooling leads to transformation into hadrons .",
    "it is indeed a very complicated phenomena as predicted by the heavy - ion collider experiments .",
    "so , the formation of quark - gluon plasma droplet ( fireball ) is a very exciting field in the present day of heavy ion collider physics [ 2 ] .",
    "the central assumption in this approach treats the qgp - hadron system as a quasi - static equilibrium enabling applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics to this complicated system .",
    "this central assumption has been employed by many pioneers in this field [ 2 - 3 ] .",
    "as we know from the extensive literature [ 4 ] , it is really needed to look at the nucleation process produced by the statistical fluctuations of the critical free energy difference between two phases .",
    "the model of csernai - kapusta et al .",
    "[ 3 - 5 ] uses the liquid drop model expansion for this nucleation .",
    "this model is used by ramanathan et al . [ 4 ] .",
    "now it is modified with the effect of curvature term in their free energy of the liquid drop . this modified free energy is :    @xmath4   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ 4\\pi r^{2 } \\sigma+ 8\\pi c r                                                  \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term represents the volume contribution , the second term is the surface contribution where @xmath5 is the surface tension , and the third term is the curvature term .",
    "we are interested to see the effect of this curvature on the free energy .",
    "the critical radius @xmath6 can be obtained by minimising eqn.(1 ) with respect to the droplet radius @xmath7 , which gives two critical radii ,    @xmath8    with smaller radius corresponds to a local mimimum in free energy and the larger to a local maximun .",
    "we take the local maximum value of the radius as suitable case for our fireball system . at the local maxima , it has existence of stable solution",
    ". then , we calculate the surface tension through @xmath9 and it is obtained as : @xmath10 where  c  is the curvature coefficient . to calculate the total relativistic density of states for quarks and gluons , it is necessary to modify the density of states we obtained in our earlier paper  [ 4 ] . in that paper , we calculated the density of states adapting the procedures of the thomas - fermi construction of the electronic density of states for complex atoms and the bethe density of states [ 6 ] for nucleons in the complex nuclei as templates . to modify these total density of states",
    ", we consider the higher order approximation scheme [ 7 ] , which can give better results in the calculation of total free energy of quarks and gluons . this higher order approximation is considered to be the curvature factor in this model . in view of this situation , we construct density of states breifly highlighting the ramanathan et al . statistical model in the hadronic medium for obtaining free energy of quarks and gluons . in the next section ,",
    "we use total free energy to calculate the interfacial surface tension , thermodynamic variables and speed of sound in this model with the curvature term .",
    "to determine the density of states of qgp droplet , the atomic model of large atomic number of thomas and fermi [ 6]is modified by ramanathan et al .",
    "the total electronic density of states defined by the thomas and fermi in phase space is : @xmath11^{3/2 } \\nu / 3 \\pi^2~.\\ ] ]    or ,    @xmath12~ [ -v(k)]^{1/2 } \\cdot \\biggl[-\\frac{dv(k)}{dk}\\biggl]\\ ] ]    this model of electron is replaced by ramanathan et al.s model of qgp droplet with the corresponding density of states for quark and gluon with a suitable qcd induced phenomenological potential @xmath13 .",
    "it is given as :    @xmath14^{3}\\nu/3\\pi^{2}~,\\ ] ]    or ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the volume occupied by the qgp and @xmath17 is the relativistic four - momentum in natural units .",
    "@xmath18 could be any confining potential for quarks and gluons .",
    "this potential plays the role of a mean field potential in phase space similar to the mean field potential of the thomas - fermi scheme , but in a very different context - namely the qgp - hadron system .",
    "the distinction of these two model is that thomas - fermi model deals about low temperature feature whereas qgp is high temperature feature which subsequently leads to transformation into hadrons .",
    "taking into account of all these factors , the density of states was modified with a suitable parametrization factor in the dynamics of the qgp fluid .",
    "thus , if we consider that the curvature is essential higher order correction factor in free energy expansion , then the density of states is further modified by using the technique of neergaard et al . [ 7],so that it gives more effective results in the free energy .",
    "so the modified density of states for quarks and gluons is given as : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is function of @xmath21 and depends on the type of field and on the boundary conditions .",
    "the different values of @xmath22 for different particles are given as : @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 @xmath25 which are in the limit of dynamical quark mass .",
    "to calculate the interacting potential within the system , it is very ideal to find the effective mean field potential among the quarks and quark - gluon .",
    "this effective potential is obtained through thermal hamiltonian for the qgp [ 8 ] .",
    "@xmath26 where , @xmath27 for first order qcd running coupling constant , which for quarks with three flavors is , [ 8 ]    @xmath28    in the above expression , @xmath29 is qcd parameter with our parametrization factors @xmath30 which we take @xmath31  and  @xmath32  or  @xmath33 times @xmath34 .",
    "this value fits the lattice qcd simulation[9 ] .",
    "this effective perturbed potential will have minimum value at each point of phase space .",
    "that is :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 .",
    "so , this is called as low energy cut off in the model leading to finite integrals by avoiding the infra - red divergence .",
    "it is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we calculate the free energy for quarks and gluons with the above modified density of states . @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the modified density of states of the particular particle @xmath41 ( quarks , gluons , pions etc . ) and @xmath42 is the degeneracy factor ( color and particle - antiparticle degeneracy ) which is @xmath43 for quarks and @xmath44 for gluons [ 7]and @xmath45 for pions .",
    "the density of state for interfacial surface is calculated through the weyl s model and ramanathan et al s model .",
    "it is obtained as : @xmath46 therefore , the interfacial energy obtained through a scalar weyl - surface in ramanathan et.al[4,10-11 ] with suitable modification to take care of the hydrodynamic effects [ 12 ] is : @xmath47 where @xmath48    which is the effective rms value of the flow parameter of the quarks and gluons respectively .",
    "the pion free energy is [ 10 ]    @xmath49    for the quark masses we use the current ( dynamic ) quark masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 , just as in reference[10 ] .",
    "we can thus compute the total free energy @xmath52 as , @xmath53   where @xmath41 stands for @xmath54,@xmath55 and @xmath56  quark and gluon .",
    "from the above equation ( 20 ) , we can compute the free - energy change with respect to the droplet radius for two promising parametrisation factors . as the value of these two cases give more exciting results in the free energy shown in fig . @xmath57 and fig.@xmath58",
    ", we expect that the formation of droplet with observable critical droplet radius will exhibit the proper transition features in the band of temperature @xmath59 to @xmath60 which are expected from lattice calculations too .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]    the figs . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the two most promising scenarios of our model which exhibit measurable droplet radius of the order of few fermi , and show significant barrier amplitudes in free energy which account for the nucleation rate of droplet formation , which was shown in the earlier paper too@xmath61 $ ] .",
    "so , we use these promising values of the free energy with curvature and look at the changes produced by this effect .",
    "the set of parameters leading to fig @xmath57 seems more realistic because of stability of droplet size at free energy nearly at critical radius irrespective of the transition temperature unlike in fig .",
    "@xmath58 . from the values of the critical free - energy at the corresponding critical fireball radius that can be extracted from the figs . 1 and 2 , we can compute the surface tension of the fireball using equation ( 3 ) as listed in tables 1 and 2 .",

    "it is happened in the first order thermodynamic variable .",
    "the discontinuity is just of the order of one standard deviation of the entropy variable and therefore indeed claim to be a very weak transition . for the second order variable @xmath70 shown in figs . @xmath76 and @xmath43 , there is absolutely no discontinuity in the variable with increase in temperature .",
    "[ cv_6.eps ]    [ cv_8.eps ]    even though the curvature term is accounted for our calculations there is a little improvement in the speed of sound .",

    "the model calculation of sound speed is also independent of the transition temperature and model parametrization factor .",
    "[ tcs6.eps ]    [ tcs8.eps ]",
    "the free energy calculations for the two promising parametrization factors are shown in the figs.[1 ] and [ 2 ] .",
    "there is good improvement in the free energy with this curvature correction .",
    "the energy at @xmath6 is about two times the energy without the curvature and there is increase in the maximum stable droplet size . due to this significant effect in the amplitude of the free energy , we determine the surface tension , thermodynamic variables and speed of sound in qgp for these two factors .",
    "there is significant increase in surface tension with the critical temperature in this modified free energy .",
    "this shows good improvement over the earlier results of ramanathan et al . without curvature",
    "this leading order term of curvature has good impact to find the surface tension .",
    "the calculated value of surface tension is found to be @xmath77 , which is two times the earlier results that is @xmath78 [ 5 ] and this present value is nearly close to higher value of lattice results that is@xmath79[7,13 ] .",
    "the result is still consistent with earlier ones in terms of its constancy through out the temperature and parametrization factors .",
    "it is perfect conformity with the latest qcd simulations [ 9 ] .",
    "the model still shows weakly first order phase transition at the temperature in the range @xmath80 with this effect of curvature in the free energy and it is expected with the current feature of qgp - hadron phase transition too [ 1 ] .",
    "thus , this transition is a mild characteristic in nature and discontinuity is found in the first order thermodynamic variable namely the entropy @xmath69 as shown in figs.@xmath45 and @xmath72 .",
    "lastly , the speed of sound with curvature correction is compared with the earlier result without curvature .",
    "the improvement in the speed of sound is very small .",
    "we obtained this value earlier nearly close to @xmath81 .",
    "presently it is found to be @xmath82 but still the result is showing low value with the lattice qcd as before[13 ] .",
    "this low result is expected with the recent model calculations [ 14]and lattice simulations that include dynamical quarks [ 15 ] , but as should be expected , it is at variance with pure gauge lattice results[16 ] .",
