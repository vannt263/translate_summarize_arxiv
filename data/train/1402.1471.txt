    "recently , there has been huge progress in understanding out - of - equilibrium dynamics in isolated many - body quantum systems , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "different experimental setups , in particular experiments on ultra cold atoms , can be found in the review article @xcite and references therein .    theoretically , one - dimensional integrable models play an essential role in understanding relaxation processes in many - body quantum systems .",
    "many of them show strong correlations and there are ( infinitely many ) non - trivial conservation laws that strongly constrain the dynamics . despite these constraints and",
    "although the time evolution is unitary , it is believed that local observables generically approach stationary values .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the system relaxes to a so - called generalized gibbs ensemble @xcite , which depends upon as many parameters as the number of conservation laws . calculating these parameters ( even when the gge is truncated ) is , in general , a difficult problem @xcite . in case of the one - dimensional spin-1/2 xxz model",
    "one can avoid their explicit calculation by working with the so - called generating function @xcite , and using the quantum transfer matrix technique @xcite and the related method of calculating short - distance correlation functions @xcite .",
    "however , the recently - proposed quench action approach @xcite does not utilize an underlying assumption for the steady state ensemble and hence circumvents those difficulties . within this method",
    "the steady state can be exactly calculated in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it determines stationary expectation values of operators as well as their full time dependencies .",
    "one of the main requirements for this approach is the knowledge of the large size scaling of overlaps of the initial state with energy eigenstates .    for many integrable models the calculation of scalar products between different bethe states",
    "@xcite is possible due to underlying algebraic structures ( algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite , see e.g.  the textbook @xcite ) .",
    "however , up to recent times very little was known about scalar products of eigenstates of different hamiltonians . in two cases , namely the lieb - liniger bose gas @xcite and the one - dimensional spin-1/2 xxz model @xcite , analytic expressions for such scalar products that are treatable in the thermodynamic limit were recently discovered @xcite .",
    "they are all given by determinants of ` gaudin - like ' form @xcite .",
    "hence , their scaling with large system size can be extracted , allowing then to study interaction quench problems following the approach of  @xcite as well as some thermodynamic equilibrium properties of spin chains as in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in  @xcite the authors present a formula for overlaps of lieb - liniger bethe states with the state of spatially uniformly distributed bosons ( bec state ) , the ground state of the non - interacting bose gas .",
    "they checked their result analytically up to eight particles . in",
    "@xcite the same authors show that the overlap of the nel state , the ground state of the antiferromagnetic ising model , with xxz bethe states can be expressed similarly .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to give a rigorous proof of the lieb - liniger overlap formula for an arbitrary number of particles by using the proven results for xxz overlaps of  @xcite .    in  @xcite only the nel state as an initial state is considered , which lies in the zero - magnetization sector of the xxz spin chain . here",
    "we shall present a formula for overlaps of bethe states with so - called @xmath0-raised nel states which lie in non - zero magnetization sectors .",
    "we consider overlaps with different initial states , namely the @xmath0-raised dimer and @xmath0-dimer states , as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapter",
    "[ sec : xxz_basics ] we define the main objects of the algebraic bethe ansatz of the xxz model and we present the most important formulas that are needed in following chapters .",
    "we introduce different initial states for which we can express the overlaps with xxz bethe states by a determinant of gaudin type .",
    "we further discuss the special scaling limit of the xxz spin chain which leads to the lieb - liniger bose gas . in chapter",
    "[ sec : overlaps ] we present the overlap formulas for those initial states .",
    "we show that one of these determinant expressions can be evaluated in the scaling limit to lieb - liniger which eventually proves the recently - proposed lieb - liniger overlap formula of  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional spin-1/2 xxz model is given by @xmath2 where periodic boundary conditions @xmath3 , @xmath4 , are supposed .",
    "we parametrize the anisotropy parameter of the model by @xmath5 .",
    "the xxz model is integrable .",
    "it corresponds to a two - dimensional classical 6-vertex model @xcite , which means that it is solvable using bethe ansatz techniques @xcite , especially the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "one of the basic ideas of the algebraic bethe ansatz is that the hamiltonian of the model under consideration can be constructed as a member of an infinite series of conserved quantities which can be obtained from a family of commuting matrices .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath6 depends on a spectral parameter @xmath7 and is defined as the trace of the so - called monodromy matrix .",
    "the commutativity @xmath8=0 $ ] is related to an underlying algebraic structure of the monodromy matrix , the yang - baxter algebra , which is a set of quadratic relations defined by the so - called @xmath9-matrix .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as a vertex operator of a classical vertex model , which is , in case of the spin-1/2 xxz chain , the @xmath9-matrix of the 6-vertex model @xcite .",
    "the integrable structure of the spin-1/2 xxz chain is related to the yang - baxter algebra that is defined as the free associative algebra of generators @xmath10 , @xmath11 , modulo the quadratic relations ( see e.g.  the textbooks @xcite ) @xmath12 the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 is called monodromy matrix and has the generators of the yang - baxter algebra as entries .",

    "the connection between the overlaps for the two different models , the xxz spin chain and the lieb - liniger bose gas , opens a way to discover more initial states for the lieb - liniger model .",
    "one could , for example , create non - uniform states by connecting the scaling limit to lieb - liniger with the limit of the rapidities which are sent to infinity .",
    "this can lead to different initial states and , of course , to different gaudin - like determinant expressions , depending on how we send the rapidities to infinity .",
    "the leading behavior of these determinants in the thermodynamic limit can be evaluated which allows then for an exact analysis of non - equilibrium dynamics using the quench action approach proposed in  @xcite . within this method",
    "the time dependence of expectation values of certain operators is in principle accessible . especially in the large time limit",
