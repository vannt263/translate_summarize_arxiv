    "in recent years , many floer - theoretic invariants for legendrian knots have been introduced : in 2008 , ozsvth , szab and thurston @xcite used grid diagrams to define two invariants @xmath5 and @xmath6 of oriented legendrian knots @xmath2 in @xmath7 , taking values in a combinatorial version of knot floer homology .",

    "if so , what is this relation exactly ?",
    "late in 2008 , a first answer to these questions was given by stipsicz and vrtesi , who explained how @xmath0 determines @xmath8 @xcite ; recently , baldwin , vela  vick and vrtesi were able to prove the equivalence of the combinatorial invariants @xmath11 and the loss invariants @xmath10 @xcite .",
