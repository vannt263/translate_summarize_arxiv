    "in the study of partial differential equations a fundamental question is when , and in what sense , a solution exists for low regularity initial data . in this paper",
    "we study the question of existence and uniqueness of curve shortening flow when the initial data is a jordan curve on @xmath1 .",
    "this result extends the author s work in  @xcite where the planar case was studied .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following :    [ jordancurve ] let @xmath6 be a jordan curve .",
    "then there exists a maximal smooth solution of curve shortening flow @xmath7 such that @xmath8 in the space of continuous curves .    moreover , if the lebesgue measure of @xmath0 is zero then    1 .",

    "@xcite we first show that the level - set flow of @xmath0 is smooth .",
    "the level - set flow is a weak notion of curve shortening flow ( and more generally mean curvature flow ) which evolves a compact set in a way that agrees with smooth curve shortening flow when it exists .    for positive area curves",
    "we show in section  [ unique_section ] that for small positive times the level - set flow is a smooth annulus which eventually either vanishes , converges to a hemisphere or takes up all of @xmath1 .",
    "see theorem  [ positive ] .",
    "let @xmath10 be a 2-dimensional riemannian manifold and @xmath11 be a smooth immersion .",
    "a 1-parameter family of immersions @xmath12 is a solution to curve shortening flow with initial data @xmath13 if @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the geodesic curvature and @xmath17 is the curvature vector . if @xmath18 is a solution to curve shortening flow then we denote by @xmath19 the smooth curve @xmath20 .",
    "the short - time existence of solutions for smooth initial data was proved in the planar case by gage and hamilton  @xcite and for surfaces which are convex at infinity by grayson  @xcite . in the case of",
    "embedded initial data it was also proved in  @xcite that there are only two possibilities for the long - term behaviour of such a solution .",
    "the first is that there exists @xmath21 so that the solution exists only on @xmath22 , collapses to a point and has a ` circular ' singularity as @xmath23 .",
    "the second case is that the solution exists on @xmath24 and @xmath16 converges uniformly to zero . when @xmath25 the second case occurs if and only if the original curve bisects the area of @xmath1 since the gauss - bonnet theorem can be used to show that this property is preserved by the flow  @xcite .",
    "previously , the most general existence result in a general surface was proved by huisken and ecker  @xcite who required that @xmath0 be ` uniformly locally - lipschitz ' , a stronger condition than rectifiability .",
    "recently , hershkovits  @xcite has shown that certain reifenberg sets have smooth level - set flow , including some fractals in @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "thus  @xcite provides the first example of such behaviour in higher dimensions .",
    "the majority of the work towards establishing the smoothness of the level - set flow is in proving a length estimate whose statement contains the notions of a @xmath28-spacing ( section  [ space_sec ] ) and the @xmath5-multiplicity @xmath29 ( section  [ mult_sec ] ) . roughly speaking",
    ", a @xmath28-spacing of @xmath0 is a large collection of open balls of radius @xmath30 in the complement of @xmath0 .",

    "it is possible to produce estimates for immersed curves , as was done for planar curves in  @xcite , but here we prove only what is necessary for the proof of theorem  [ jordancurve ] .",
    "the utility of theorem  [ length ] stems from the fact that if @xmath38 uniformly then a @xmath28-spacing for @xmath0 will be a @xmath28-spacing for @xmath39 for sufficiently large  @xmath40 .",
    "since the @xmath5-multiplicity is also well - behaved under uniform convergence we obtain the following :    [ approx ] let @xmath0 be a jordan curve on @xmath1 .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath41 and a function @xmath42 such that if @xmath39 is a sequence of smooth embedded curves that converge uniformly to @xmath0 then @xmath43 for @xmath34 and @xmath40 sufficiently large .",
    "the important points are that ( 1 ) the right - hand side is independent of @xmath40 , and ( 2 ) the estimate is valid on a definite time interval independent of the approximating sequence .",
    "theorem  [ approx ] immediately rules out the possibility that the level set flow of a measure zero jordan curve has infinite length .",

    "can be obtained which is proportional to the maximum number of times that @xmath0 intersects each leaf in two transverse foliations of @xmath55 with linear leaves .",
    "this approach is unsuitable for our applications since the number of times @xmath39 intersects a particular great circle is not necessarily bounded .",
    "instead , we replace the linear foliation by one for which the number of intersections of each leaf with @xmath0 is controlled by the @xmath5-multiplicity .",
    "these foliations are no longer linear , but evolve to be nearly linear at a given time  @xmath56 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath44 be a great circle through @xmath57 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath56 we determine an appropriate scale @xmath52 and construct a foliation @xmath58 of @xmath59 such that if @xmath60 is a leaf of @xmath58 then    1 .",

    "see figure  [ leafable_fig ] .",
    "the definition of leafable depends on a parameter @xmath31 which measures the size of the set on which the curve is required to be close to @xmath44 . in practice , @xmath30 is determined by the size of the spacing for the curve whose length is being bounded .",
    "the result that guarantees that a leafable curves evolves to be nearly linear is the following :    [ straightintro ] given @xmath31 and @xmath64 there exists @xmath65 such that for each @xmath34 there exists @xmath66 with the following property : if @xmath44 is a great circle and @xmath67 is leafable then @xmath61 is an @xmath68 @xmath62-close to @xmath44 .    in  @xcite the proof of the analogous result used a family of grim reapers . indeed",
    "the lack of a suitable replacement is one of the main obstacles in extending the arguments in  @xcite to general surfaces .",
    "for @xmath1 we use a solution of the dirichlet problem for curve shortening flow , i.e. the evolution of an arc with fixed endpoints , to play the same role .",

    "the local length estimates let @xmath69 be a great circle perpendicular to @xmath44 at @xmath53 and construct a foliation as above of @xmath70 .",
    "we then show that the restriction of the two foliations at time @xmath71 to @xmath55 is uniformly bi - lipschitz equivalent to the standard grid in @xmath72 , and estimates for @xmath73 follow since the number of intersections of @xmath19 with each leaf in either foliation is at most @xmath74",

    "the initial leaves of the foliations are linear at infinity .",
    "this is of course impossible on @xmath1 so we introduce the concept of a @xmath28-spacing , which provides a scale so that the foliations can be constructed using curves that are nearly linear on a set of some definite size .",
    "grim reapers are used in the planar case , but there are no translating solutions on  @xmath1 .",
    "thus we replace them with a suitable solution of a dirichlet problem .",
    "the analysis is more complicated since the solutions are not explicit .",
    "in this section we use the explicit evolution of the shrinking circle to fix a time and scale so that hausdorff distance between a curve and a great circle will not increase significantly if they are initially close .",
    "lemma  [ expand ] is used in the sequel to guarantee that a leafable curve does not pass through the endpoints of the solution to the dirichlet problem constructed in section  [ dirichlet_section ] .",
