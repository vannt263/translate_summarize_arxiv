    "in the traditional view cognitive processing is based on coexisting fixpoint attractors  @xcite that determine the brain dynamics .",
    "although there are phenomena , like associative memory  @xcite , that can be modeled in this way , the consequence of an attractor based model is close at hand : it needs an external stimulus , e.g.  input from the visual system , to reset the dynamics .",
    "however , recent experimental observations in the olfactory system of zebrafish  @xcite or the gustatory cortex  @xcite found that neural activity is characterized by transitions between multiple meta - stable attractors . resting - state brain networks also show complex spatiotemporal structures , with different connections consistently transitioning between high and low levels of connectivity , which resembles transiently existing attractor structures @xcite .",
    "such state dependent fluctuations may play an important role in general or task - related brain computations @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a new theoretical description of brain dynamics : neural dynamics might be guided by transiently attracting states that emerge from stable fixed points being destroyed by noise or superposition with an additional slow process .",
    "thus the attracting set is not asymptotically stable but rather transiently attracting .",
    "noise driven exploration of the attractor landscape can take advantage of the coexistence of stable attractors , visiting them transiently at the edge of multistability @xcite .",
    "this transient state dynamics  @xcite is also found in resting state networks  @xcite , where even in the complete absence of any external stimulus it enables processes that are associated with cognitive tasks  @xcite .",
    "the concept of destroyed fixpoints shaping the dynamics of a system can be found in literature under various names such as attractor ruins or relics  @xcite , transient attractors  @xcite , sometimes also named ghosts within the more general concept of slow points  @xcite in dynamical systems .",
    "it is known that transient attractors are present in slow - fast systems  @xcite , i.e.  dynamical systems with distinct time scales . there",
    "the fixpoints of the fast subsystem , termed here as _ adiabatic fixpoints _ , being formally destroyed by an additional slower subsystem , form slow manifolds  @xcite , also called cortical manifolds  @xcite .",
    "these manifolds of transiently stable states have a pronounced influence on the overall dynamics , which mostly takes place in a close vicinity to the slow manifold .",
    "such behavior is addressed by the field of singular perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it has been investigated for a number of low - dimensional relaxation oscillators  @xcite , e.g.  the van - der - pol oscillator and the fitzhugh - nagumo oscillator  @xcite , which are also used to approximate neural dynamics , as well as for small hopfield - type neural networks @xcite .",
    "besides the analysis of motion on the slow manifold  @xcite and studies on the detailed influence of different time scales  @xcite , also the scaling behavior at bifurcations in slow - fast systems  @xcite has been examined .",
    "it is generally accepted that a complete hierarchy of time scales  @xcite is necessary to describe the different tasks and activity levels in the brain . to incorporate the whole range of memory , i.e.  working memory , short - term and long - term memory , a range of distinct time scales is needed to model different types of plasticity  @xcite .",
    "functional hierarchy in recurrent neural networks for motion task  @xcite is another phenomenon that emerges from a separation of the time scales involved .        in this study",
    "we investigate the effect of slow manifolds on the dynamics of a recurrent neural network , which is modelled by a slow - fast dynamical system with two distinct time scales .",
    "introducing in the first part the concept of _ target points _ , we focus on the subset of points on the slow manifold , which effectively controls a given trajectory .",
    "we aim thus to characterize the transient state dynamics by the effectively attracting transient attractors . as we are mainly interested in the impact on the intrinsic dynamics of the network , we restrict ourselves to autonomously active networks , i.e.  networks without external input .",
    "futher we apply the theoretical results to a small example network and investigate the resulting dynamics when varying the separation of time scales . here",
    "we use the distance as a euclidean measure to quantify the influence of adiabatic fixed points on the current state , describing two contrary regimes :    * the _ adiabatic regime _ , where a change in the relative time scale between fast and slow subsystem results in a change of the average distance to the targets * the _ non - adiabatic regime _",
    ", where the distance to the targets is quasi invariant under a change of the relative time scale    we first examine the transition between these two regimes within the limit of a symmetry protected network structure , generalizing it afterwards .",
    "we investigate the shape of the target point manifold , which reveals the metadynamics  @xcite of the transient attractors",
    ".    to conclude the investigation of the explicit network , we present an example of chaotic motion in the network and compute the corresponding target points .",

    "the invariant manifold of fixed points in the fast subsystem , i.e.@xmath5 for given and fixed @xmath6 , is of special interest for the analysis of slow - fast dynamical systems .",
    "the entirety of these points , which are the intersections of the null - clines @xmath7 of the fast subsystem  @xcite , are generally termed slow manifolds  @xcite or critical manifolds  @xcite . in the literature",
    "these points appear also under various names such as ghosts  @xcite or attractor ruins  @xcite , with sometimes contradicting definitions . for our study",
    "we constrain ourselves to a fast subsystem , for which every state of the full system @xmath8 is in the basin of attraction of a fixed point of the fast subsystem . the slow manifolds are therefore exclusively composed of isolated fixed points of the fast subsystem .      in physics terminology the limit @xmath9 of a stationary subsystem",
    "is termed the adiabatic limit and finds application , e.g.  in the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite , where the slow movement of the atomic nuclei can be neglected when addressing the comparably fast dynamics of the electrons .",
    "we will hence use the term adiabatic fixpoint ( afp ) for the fixpoints of the fast subsystem , as illustrated in fig .",

    "correspondingly to normal fixpoints adiabatic fixed points may generically be either stable , unstable or saddle type .",

    "many stable afp , for the same configuration @xmath6 in the slow subsystem , only one will influence effectively the motion of the full system . considering a generic dynamical state @xmath12 we term the stable afp that the fast subsystem starting from @xmath13 converges to for fixed @xmath14 a target point corresponding to the given state .",
