    "nanotubes have attracted a large amount of interest ever since they were first discovered in 1991 @xcite .",
    "they can be thought of as carbon cylinders with a hexagonal grid and are thus fullerene related structures .",
    "their mechanical , thermal , optical and electrical properties have been studied in some detail @xcite .",
    "it was found that most properties depend crucially on the diameter , chirality and lengths of the tube .",
    "a distortion of the lattice thus affects the energy band gap .",
    "this distortion of the lattice can be achieved in two different ways : a ) through an external force like e.g. bending , stretching or twisting @xcite or b ) through an internal excitation , which interacts with the lattice .",
    "it is well known that the interaction of an excitation such as an amide i- vibration in biopolymers or an electron ( in the case of the frhlich hamiltonian ) with a lattice whose distortion is initially caused by the excitation results in the creation of a localised state which , in what follows , we refer to as a soliton .",
    "such a soliton was first introduced by davydov @xcite in the 1970s to explain the dispersion free energy transport in biopolymers ( see also @xcite for further details ) .",
    "recently , a frhlich hamitonian was studied on a two - dimensional , discrete , quadratic lattice @xcite . in @xcite , the existence of localised states",
    "was studied numerically and it was found that their properties depend crucially on the electron - phonon coupling constant . an analytical study confirmed these results @xcite - by showing that in the continuum limit the set of discrete equations reduces to a modified non - linear schrdinger ( mnls ) equation which has an additional term resulting from the discreteness of the lattice .",
    "although a soliton of the basic nls is unstable the extra term was shown to stabilise it for appropriate choices of the coupling constant .    in this paper , we extend the study of refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of a hexagonal , periodic lattice with a large extension in @xmath0 and a small extension in @xmath1 directions .",
    "we study the resultant equations both analytically and numerically . in section",
    "ii we present the hamiltonian and the equations of motion . in section iii",
    "we discuss various properties of the equations in the stationary limit and we demonstrate the existence of an * exact * solution of the discrete equations . in this limit , we can thus replace the full system of equations by a modified discrete non - linear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation . in section iv , we present and compare our numerical results for the continuous mnls equation , for the full system of equations and for the modified dnls equation .",
    "most of our numerical simulations are performed for the @xmath2 armchair tube .",
    "such nanotube was discussed in a recent paper by liu et al . in the context of nanorings @xcite .",
    "we also discuss briefly how nanotubes with different diameter and chirality could be constructed in our model .",

    "moreover , @xmath58 . inserting this into ( [ discrete ] ) , we obtain : @xmath59 or , equivalently , @xmath60    we thus have , in analogy to what was found in @xcite , a modified nonlinear schrdinger ( mnls ) equation with an extra term , which can stabilise the soliton : @xmath61 following @xcite we see that the conserved energy in this case is given by : @xmath62 approximating the soliton solution of ( 21 ) by a gaussian of the form @xmath63 we find that the value of @xmath64 that minimises the energy is @xmath65 and thus we have an estimate of the critical @xmath66 , namely , @xmath67 .",
    "first , we have considered the continuous , modified non - linear schrdinger equation ( [ cnls ] ) . for this , we have taken the radially symmetric ansatz : @xmath68 and put this into ( 21 ) .",
    "then we have solved the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) using a collocation method for the boundary value odes @xcite and choosing the boundary conditions : @xmath69 our results are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath70 we have determined the value of the function @xmath71 at the origin , @xmath72 , as well as the value of @xmath73 for which the norm of the solution is equal to unity . as can be seen from fig .  1 , we have found that for a critical value of @xmath74 the value of @xmath75 tends to zero . since",
    "our construction is such that the maximum of the solution is located at @xmath76 , the value of the height of the solution tends to zero and thus the solution ceases to exist .",
    "we thus find that the critical value of @xmath70 from our numerical construction agrees with the upper - bound value obtained from the variational approach based on the gaussian , namely , @xmath77 .",
    "note that the solutions cease to exist when the value of @xmath73 tends to zero .",
    "since we can interpret @xmath73 as the frequency of an internal rotation , the solutions apparently cease to exist when there is no internal rotation .",
    "this can be compared to the so - called `` q - balls '' which are non - topological solitons characterized also by a complex scalar field @xcite of the form similar to ( [ ansatz ] ) . for them",
    "its is known@xcite that there exist upper and lower positive - valued bounds on the frequency of the internal rotation in order for q - balls to be stable . in comparison ,",
    "our solutions exist for all values of @xmath78 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that while the dynamical part of our action is similar to that for q - balls , we have a extra term involving derivatives as compared to an `` ordinary '' @xmath79-potential in the case of q - balls .        for our numerical study of the full equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] )",
    "we have found it convenient to `` squeeze '' the lattice as indicated in figs .",
    "2a und 2b .",
    "the hamiltonian and the corresponding equations are given in the appendix .",
    "for our numerical calculations , we have used mainly a periodic grid with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have in addition chosen the boundary conditions such that the fields at @xmath82 are identified with those at @xmath83 .",
    "thus the type of nanotube we are studying here is a @xmath2 armchair tube which is metallic @xcite .",
    "nanotubes can also be semiconducting and we make a brief comment about the possibility of constructing semiconducting tubes in our model in the last paragraph of this section .    in this work ,",
    "the c - c bond length , @xmath84 nm @xcite , is normalised to unity . therefore",
    ", the tube diameter is @xmath85 nm .",
    "tubes with different diameter can also be constructed in our model .",
    "we discuss this together with different chiralities in the last paragraph of this section .",
    "as starting configuration we have used an exponential - like excitation @xmath4 extended typically over the lattice points @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the lattice at equilibrium everywhere , i.e. @xmath88 and @xmath89 for all @xmath90 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the existence of solitons and their dependence on the value of the coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "we have set @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "so the exact values of @xmath12 and @xmath16 play a minor role .",
    "hence , we have set them to one .",
    "the choice of @xmath92 is a reflection of the physical fact that the mass of the carbon atom is approximately @xmath94 .    to absorb the energy thus allowing the initial configuration to evolve into the stationary solutions of ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) , i.e. of ( [ sch])-([vs ] ) we have additionally introduced damping terms @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , into the equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "we have typically chosen @xmath97 .",
    "for this choice of the coupling constants , we have performed several numerical calculations using a @xmath98th order runge - kutta method for simulating the time evolution .",
    "we have found that solitons exist in this system for @xmath99 . for larger values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the soliton forms very quickly , while decreasing @xmath13 the time increases at which a soliton forms .",
    "this is of course due to the weaker coupling between the dynamics of the lattice itself and the excitation . for @xmath100 ,",
    "we have waited until @xmath101 and havent found a soliton . moreover , in all cases we have found only little displacement of the lattice from the equilibrium .",
    "we have found that at the location of the soliton the lattice becomes squeezed ( i.e. the lattice sites move towards the sites at which the soliton is located ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  3 for @xmath102 , where we show the lattice distortion after @xmath103 .",
    "the point at which the centre of the soliton is located does nt move , while the sites in its close neighbourhood all move towards the centre of the soliton .    we have also studied the effects of perturbations of the solitons . we have found that after perturbing the soliton we obtain a new solution with a different height of the soliton maximum . even after introducing a perturbation which keeps the maximal height fixed , the new solution differs from the starting one .",
    "we thus come to the conclusion that the full system of equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) has a large number of solutions for each choice of coupling constants .",
    "we believe that a conserved quantity exists in this system which picks out the specific solution .",
    "however , so far we have not been able to determine this conserved quantity .",
    "in addition to the full system of equations , we have also studied the dynamical analog of equation ( [ nls ] ) . using a similar starting configuration with @xmath4 being exponential and nonzero over @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we have determined the value of @xmath70 for which a soliton exists .",
    "our results are shown in fig .  4 where we present the height of the soliton s maximum @xmath104 as function of @xmath70 .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath70 at which the soliton disappears @xmath105 .",
    "the height of the soliton at this critical coupling is @xmath106 .",
    "our numerical study of the continuous mnls equation gave us @xmath107 , while the analytic study led to @xmath77 .",
    "both values are not a bad approximation for the value found numerically for the discrete equation .    to test the independence of our results from the form of the initial settings , we have used a different starting configuration with two exponential - like excitations being located at @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "we have found that for values @xmath110 , the results agree .",
    "for both types of initial configurations , the minimal energy configuration corresponds to one soliton .",
    "however , having said this , the time to reach this minimal energy configurations is significantly smaller for the initial configuration with one excitation than for that with two ( typically one order of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "we have also tested our results as to the dependence on the size of the grid . for this , we have chosen two excitations on three different grid sizes : a ) a grid with @xmath80 , @xmath81 and two exponential excitations extended over @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , respectively , b ) a grid with @xmath111 and @xmath112 with the excitations located at the same places than in a ) , and finally c ) a grid with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and two exponential excitations extended over @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "we have found that for @xmath119 , the results of cases a ) and c ) agree .",
    "for the case a ) the soliton forms at @xmath120 , while for the case c ) it forms at @xmath121 .",
    "this is not suprising since in the case c ) , the two excitations are located nearer to each other than in the case a ) . to test the dependence on the actual lattice size we have compared the cases a ) and b ) .",
    "we have found that the larger the lattice the longer it takes for the soliton to form . for @xmath119 a soliton forms after @xmath120 in the case",
    "a ) , while for b ) it forms at @xmath122 .",
    "we have thus found that , in comparison with the case of the full system of equations , the solutions of the dnls equation are unique for each choice of the coupling constant .      since we have found that in the stationary limit the full system of equations can be replaced by a dnls equation , the minimal energy solutions we have obtained for both types of equations should be in agreement .    comparing the two systems",
    ", we see that the value @xmath70 is given in terms of the coupling constants of the full system by : @xmath123 which , for the choice of coupling constants we have used in our numerical simulations , gives : @xmath124 thus a critical value of @xmath125 would imply @xmath126 .",
    "first , we remark that the values of the critical electron - phonon coupling we obtained from all our simulations ( including those for the continuous mnls equation ) are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , there is a slight discrepancy between the results for the full system and the dnls equation .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that there might exist additional terms @xmath127 in ( [ solution ] ) for which @xmath128 and/or @xmath129 .",
    "these terms would then appear in ( [ nls ] ) and would change the comparison of the solutions .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine these additional terms and so this is left as a future work @xcite .",
    "since most of our results are for a @xmath2 armchair tube and since it is well known that the properties of nanotubes depend strongly on the diameter , chirality and lengths of the tube , we will discuss briefly how different tubes could be constructed in our model .",
    "we havent constructed these tubes yet , but we aim to do so in a future publication in which we intend to extend our approach to a more realistic three dimensional model @xcite .",
    "labelling the first carbon atom in @xmath1 direction by @xmath130 , we have chosen @xmath131 such that it is divisable by @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the length of the tube in the @xmath1-direction is @xmath132 .",
    "since we identify the fields labelled by @xmath82 with those at @xmath83 , the diameter of the tube is given by @xmath133 .",
    "thus increasing / decreasing @xmath131 by @xmath134 , @xmath135 , we can construct armchair nanotubes with diameters @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , we can construct longer tubes by increasing the number of atoms in the @xmath0 direction .    as far as chirality is concerned , there are two things to modify in our model in order to be able to construct tubes with different chirality .",
    "one is to change the number of points in the @xmath1 direction so that @xmath131 is non - divisable by @xmath98 .",
    "the other is to adjust the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1-direction appropriately .",
    "if we e.g. choose @xmath137 , we have to identify the fields at @xmath82 with those at @xmath138 .",
    "this then would give us a @xmath139 nanotube which would be semi - conducting .",
    "in this work , we have concentrated our attention on the existence of localised structures .",
    "these structures extend over large parts of our grids , but are negligible at boundaries .",
    "hence , we expect these to hold for systems with different boundary conditions , i.e. different chiralities .",
    "motivated by a large amount of research done in the area of nanotubes , we have studied solitons on a @xmath140-dimensional hexagonal lattice .",
    "we have chosen our lattice to be periodic in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions and to be of large extention in one ( the @xmath0 ) direction and of small extention in the other ( the @xmath1 ) direction . in the stationary limit , we have found that the full system of equations in which the electron excitation is coupled to the displacement fields of the lattice can be replaced by a modified discrete non - linear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .",
    "this discovery of an * exact * solution of the full system of equations is remarkable since for the similar quadratic lattice such a simple solution does not exist .    in our numerical studies",
    "we have mainly concentrated our attention on determining the value of the critical phonon - electron coupling constant . for the dnls",
    "we have found that unique solutions exist and that the value of the critical coupling is in good agreement with both the analytically and numerically values found for the continuous analog of the dnls . for the full system of equations , we believe that a large number of solutions exist for each choice of the coupling constants and that a conserved quantity exists in the system .",
    "the critical value of the electron - phonon coupling is of the same order of magnitude as in the case of the dnls ; however , we believe that this small discrepancy results from the fact that possible `` boundary '' terms appear when replacing the full system by the dnls . these boundary terms are terms which are annihilated by either the @xmath98-point laplacian @xmath141 and/or by the @xmath142-point laplacian @xmath143 . to find these terms",
    "is non - trivial and since this seems an interesting topic by itself , we leave this as a future work @xcite .    finally let us mention that a possible extension of the results given here would involve the study of the corresponding three dimensional equations and/or of the influence of external forces .",
