    "uasicrystals after dan shechtman s @xcite discovery became that missing link between periodic crystals and amorphous solids .",
    "the new state of matter was in focus of particular interest because of the interesting electronic @xcite , magnetic @xcite , and elastic properties . just as periodic crystals , quasicrystals have discrete diffration pattern @xcite , though it combined with the lack of periodicity @xcite , @xcite , which allows quasicrytals to have forbidden for periodic crystals symmetries .    an obvious idea for describing quasiperiodic crystals",
    "is to use so called crystalline approximants - periodic structure with a very large unit cell which emulates a quasiperiodic structure .",
    "another idea was developed in work of kkl @xcite where they used normalization method for a one - dimensional crystal and obtained first exact result for one - dimensional quasiperiodic structures .",
    "unfortunately , there are no exact results for higher dimensional quasicrystals .",
    "another obvious idea for solving the electronic structure of quasicrystals is to use quasiperiodic functions . or , more precisely , their periodic images embedded in higher - dimensional spaces .",
    "this idea follows from the fact that qusiperiodic functions satisfy the desired properties : they are non - periodic and their diffraction pattern is discrete @xcite . +",
    "this approach has advantages such as follows :    1 .",
    "both numerical and analytical calculations are almost as easy as for periodic structures 2 .   errors of numerical calculations are related only to machine precision    nevertheless , there is a problem on this way waiting for us : how to embed our physical equations in this non - physical space .",
    "+ in this work i have tried to find a satisfying way to overcome this problem .",
    "continuous quasiperiodic functions , as a subset of continuous almost periodic functions might be presented in fourier series : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , called fourier indices are real . unlike periodic functions , where these numbers are integers , in almost periodic functions they might be even dense . and @xmath2     + _ fig.1 quasiperiodic function @xmath3 _ [ pic_periodic_cos ]    it is widely known , that these functions are images of periodic functions on the space of higher dimension . for example",
    ", we may take simple quasiperiodic 1-dimensional function with two quasiperiods ( fig.1 ) @xmath4     + _ fig.2 periodic image of @xmath3 _ [ pic_periodic_cos ]    and , with transformation @xmath5 perform it as periodic in 2-dimensional space ( fig.2 ) .",
    "as it was said previously , we may embed a quasiperiodic one - dimensional function with two incompensurated periods in a two - dimensional space with transformation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a ratio of quasiperiods .",
    "so , our transformation ( x @xmath8 y ) @xmath9 x looks like moving along the line @xmath6 and `` measuring '' value of our function . if we will try to imagine , how it looks in a unit cell , this should be moving along family of lines @xmath10 .",
    "the exact position on fixed line will be given by @xmath11 .",
    "+ the same `` measuring '' of a value of potential is what actually electron do .",
    "embedded in a unit cell @xmath12\\times [ -b , b]$ ] , its movement may look like going from ( 0,0 ) along the line @xmath6 , then , on the top border @xmath13 ( if @xmath14 ) , it will jump to the bottom border without changing x. after that , it will start going by another line and so on . + so , it might be rational to look for an equation connecting a two - dimensional image of one - dimensional wavefunction and periodic image of our quasiperiodic potetial , in a form of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the enregy and @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "as it was said , quasiperiodic and periodic functions both might be expanded in a fourier series .",
    "using this fact , we will prove an equivalence between ( [ q - shro ] ) and one - dimensional schrdinger equation with quasiperiodic potential .",
    "acting like in bloch theorem , substitute @xmath18 , where u(x ) is quasiperiodic with quasiperiods the same as potential has , then we may obtain an equation for u(x ) : @xmath19 now expand @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 with coefficients @xmath23 . using previously defined scalar product ( [ scalar - multiply ] ) , we finally get : @xmath24 = \\\\= \\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix}l+m=\\alpha\\\\n+k=\\beta\\end{smallmatrix } }   a_{l m } b_{n k}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]      as previously , we firstly make a substitution @xmath25 where @xmath26 and u(x , y ) is periodic . substituting this to ( [ q - shro ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath27 then , making orthogonalization procedure with standard scalar product in @xmath28 , @xmath29 = 4\\cdot c \\sum_{\\begin{smallmatrix}l+m=\\alpha\\\\n+k=\\beta\\end{smallmatrix } }   a_{l m } b_{n k}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] comparing with ( [ 1dim - coeff ] ) we may conclude that c must be equal to @xmath30 and , finally , our equation takes the form @xmath31 and is totally equivalent to the schrdinger equation in one - dimensional space and quasiperiodic potential .",
    "i have applied this new technique to obtain the spectrum of non - interacting electrons located in quasiperiodic screened - coulomb ( debye ) potential .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 , n is an integer .",
    "@xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "after projecting , it becomes periodic in @xmath36 \\times [ -\\pi,\\pi]$ ] .",
    "+ it was solved numerically in finite differences in a cell @xmath37   \\times [ -\\pi , \\pi]$ ] . for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 no allowed negative energy levels were found .",
    "spectrum for positive energies , just like it is in schrdinger operator with quasiperiodic potential @xcite has no isolated points , and just like in previous works @xcite it has a sophisticated cantor - like structure .",
    "+ _ fig.3 spectrum for a screened coulomb potental _ [ spectrum ]    for every level we got the 2-dimensional images of wavefunctions .",
    "for described potential all of them were delocalized .",
    "fig.4 2-dimensional image of wavefunction + with with e=18.59 and k=0.11 _ [ wave1 ]    it appeared that harmonics with higher frequencies are becoming more important with increasing an energy ( fig 4 and 5 ) .",

    "using fourier series , it is easy to generalize our equation to quasicrystals with higher dimensionality and arbitrary symmetries .",
    "+ firstly , let us expand our three dimensional function into series @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the transformation matrix performing the slicing opertaion @xcite    @xmath43 so , the most general form of kinetic part is exactly : @xmath44 this equation , suitable for any quasiperiodic potentials is the main result of the work .",
    "+ equation can also be applied to objects periodical in one or several dimensions .",
    "we just need to zero out corresponding elements in @xmath42 . as an example , we may do it for an object that has 12-fold symmetry in x - y and periodic along z - axis . in this specific case @xcite , we will have @xmath42 equal to @xmath45 starting from here one may find the kinetic part of our hamiltonian @xmath46",
    "this work overcame the problem of periodic description quasiperiodic wave - functions of non - interacting electrons . + our method",
    "gives an ability easily get all the information about non - interacting electrons in arbitrary quasiperiodic potential .",
    "+ numerical results for one - dimensional quasiperiodic debye - potential were obtained .",
    "spectrum of this chain has self - similarity properties and likely has no isolated points .",
    "these properties agree with the general theorem @xcite which indicates corectness of the method . + since the generalization of the method",
    "is shown , results for real quasicrystalline materials can be obtained .",
