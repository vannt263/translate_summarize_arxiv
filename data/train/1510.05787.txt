    "furthermore , we note that in the isostructural pbwo@xmath0 crystals , a ms decay component was also observed below 50k @xcite .",
    "this might point to some common trapping mechanism for both materials at that temperature range .",
    "the absence of this long - lasting component in ref .   could be explained by their lower light collection efficiency .",

    "+ it is known that there is a noticeable difference between the decay curves of @xmath1 and @xmath2 events that allows pulse shape discrimination @xcite . in general",
    "it was found that @xmath1 events have faster pulses compared to @xmath2 events .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the quenching mechanism in cawo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 particles have a higher ionization density compared to electrons they generate a higher initial density of stes .",
    "this leads to an increased interaction probability for stes and thus facilitates their non - radiative destruction via the frster interaction .",
    "therefore , at the beginning of the pulse when the ste density is highest , a shortening of the average lifetime of the ste population and hence a shortening of the decay time is expected for @xmath1 particles with respect to @xmath2 events .",

    "+ comparing the pulse shapes of the two different samples under study we find that at low temperatures the tum crystal has slightly slower pulses than the sample from gpi .",
    "the emission kinetics and especially the long decay component are influenced by trapping centers in the crystal .",
    "therefore , a higher density of trapping centers in the tum crystal might account for the slower pulses .",
    "+ we note that due to the slow pulses and limited statistics we were not able to determine any possible fast ( @xmath31s ) decay component for temperatures @xmath2140k as it was observed in ref .  .",
    "we also remark that , in addition to the quenching mechanism , some difference between the number of observed components for @xmath1 and @xmath2 events may also result from the larger binning which was chosen for the latter due to the lower number of detected photons .",
    "this could in particular explain why we observe only two components for @xmath2 events compared to four components for @xmath1 s at 4.2k .",

    "dependent on temperature the value of @xmath34 of the gpi crystal is @xmath36 - 14% higher than that of the tum crystal .",
