    "analytical performance modeling of cellular networks is a long  standing open issue @xcite .",

    "cell interference modeling and for performance analysis .",
    "these abstractions usually encompass simplified spatial models for the locations of the bss .",
    "in particular , three abstraction models are commonly adopted : i ) the wyner model @xcite ; ii ) the single  cell interfering model @xcite ; and iii ) the regular hexagonal or square grid model @xcite .",
    "these abstraction models , however , are often either over  simplistic or inaccurate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in some cases , as for the regular hexagonal / square grid model , they still require either intensive numerical simulations or multi  fold numerical integrations . finally , these abstraction models usually provide information for _ specific _ bss deployments , and typically fail to provide useful information for more random , unplanned , and/or clustered bss deployments , which are typical of emerging heterogeneous cellular networks with , _",
    "e.g. _ , overlaid femtocells and picocells @xcite , @xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , a new abstraction model is currently emerging and gaining popularity , according to which the positions of the bss are modeled as points of a poisson point process ( ppp ) and powerful tools from applied probability , such as stochastic geometry , are leveraged to develop tractable integrals and closed  form mathematical frameworks for important performance metrics ( _ e.g. _ , coverage and average rate ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "the stochastic geometry based abstraction model for the analysis of cellular networks dates back to ( at least ) 1997 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a similar shotgun  based , _",
    "i.e. _ , ppp  based , abstraction model was proposed in @xcite , and it was shown that , compared with the traditional hexagonal grid model , the shotgun approach provides upper performance bounds .",
    "more recently , the ppp model has been used for the analysis of spatial and opportunistic aloha protocols @xcite , and for the characterization of the signal  to  interference  ratio ( sir ) of ( single  tier ) cellular networks @xcite . in spite of these initial and pioneering attempts of applying the ppp model and stochastic geometry to the analysis of cellular networks ,",
    "only recently the random  based abstraction model for the positions of the bss has received the attention it deserved . in particular , its emergence and widespread adoption for cellular networks analysis and design is mostly due to @xcite , where a comprehensive framework to compute coverage and average rate of single  tier deployments is provided . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the ppp model is as accurate as regular grid models , but it has the main advantage of being more analytically tractable . a comprehensive study based on real bss deployments obtained from the open source project opencellid @xcite has revealed that the ppp model can indeed be used for accurate coverage analysis in major cities worldwide .",
    "recent results about the validation of the ppp model for real bss deployments are available in @xcite , where data collected from ofcom , _",
