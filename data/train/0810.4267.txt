    "a simple extension of the standard model that can explain the dark matter is the addition of a real scalar singlet and an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry under which the singlet is odd while all other fields are even .",
    "such a singlet , which couples directly only to the higgs boson and to itself , may indeed have the right relic density in the standard cosmological model to explain the observed dark matter abundance . even though this singlet extension has been studied several times @xcite , a complete and consistent computation of the expected gamma ray flux from the annihilation of singlet dark matter has yet to be published . in this paper",
    "we will fill that void .",
    "first , an updated analysis of the parameter space of the model will be presented .",
    "then , we compute the direct detection cross section and show that present constraints require a singlet mass larger than @xmath0 gev . finally , after obtaining the gamma ray flux and total annihilation cross section , we show that over most of the viable parameter space the singlet scalar model of dark matter is _ detectable _ by fermi - glast @xcite .",
    "the observation of gamma rays originating in the annihilation of dark matter particles is one of the most promising avenues to determine the nature of dark matter .",
    "the recently launched fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fgst ) , formerly glast @xcite , will improve , with respect to its predecessor egret @xcite , the sensitivity to gamma rays in the energy range between @xmath2 mev and @xmath3 gev by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "more importantly , fgst will extend the high energy range to about @xmath4 gev , making it an ideal experiment to search for gamma rays from wimp dark matter annihilation .",
    "it is therefore critical to determine the expected gamma ray flux within diverse scenarios accounting for the dark matter .",
    "the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models is by far the most common dark matter candidate examined in the literature .",
    "even if less compelling from a theoretical point of view , the singlet scalar considered in this paper offers an interesting alternative to neutralino dark matter .",
    "depending only on two new parameters , the singlet scalar model is very predictive and could be easily falsified .",
    "moreover , the dark matter candidate is a scalar instead of a majorana fermion and its main annihilation channels do not coincide with those of the neutralino .",
    "direct and indirect detection signals are thus expected to be different .",
    "finally , the disparity between the implications for colliders searches of these two dark matter models could not be more marked .",
    "the singlet scalar model predicts the existence of _ one _ additional degree of freedom rather than a full spectrum of superpartners .",
    "the lhc , therefore , may soon shed some light on the identity of the dark matter particle and , in particular , on its supersymmetric or non - supersymmetric nature . in the meantime",
    ", it is important not to restrict ourselves to supersymmetric candidates .    over the years",
    ", several authors have studied the phenomenology of the singlet extension of the standard model .",
    "the singlet scalar as a dark matter candidate was initially proposed by mcdonald @xcite and was subsequently analyzed by burgess _",
    "al _ @xcite .",
    "recently , barger _",
    "@xcite considered models with and without the @xmath1 symmetry and investigated their expected phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "regarding dark matter , they computed the singlet relic density as well as its direct detection cross section . later on , in @xcite ,",
    "the gamma ray flux was computed but only for two specific values of the singlet - higgs coupling . in this paper",
    "we update and expand these previous results in several respects .",
    "first , we consider the full mass range , including @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for the singlet scalar .",
    "second , we use the precise determination of the dark matter density obtained by the wmap experiment @xcite as well as the accurate computation of the relic density by micromegas @xcite which includes _ all _ tree - level annihilation processes to obtain the viable parameter space of the model .",
    "third , we compute the direct detection cross section and take into account the constraints from current experiments .",
    "finally , we use state of the art techniques , as implemented in micromegas @xcite , to compute the expected gamma ray flux along the viable regions of the singlet model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the model lagrangian and will identify the new parameters that it contains . in section [ sec : rd ] the relic density is computed and used to obtain the viable parameter space .",
    "direct detection rates are then calculated and compared with the sensitivity of present and planned experiments in section [ sec : dd ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : gf ] , we compute the expected gamma ray flux and annihilation cross section and show that fermi - glast will probe a large fraction of the viable parameter space of the singlet scalar model .",
    "the lagrangian that describes the model with an additional scalar singlet , s , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the standard model lagrangian and @xmath9 is the higgs doublet .",
    "this lagrangian is the most general renormalizable one that is compatible with the @xmath10 gauge invariance and with the symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "the scalar singlet extension of the standard model , therefore , contains only @xmath12 new parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . because it only determines the strength of the singlet self - interactions , @xmath15 is unconstrained and largely irrelevant to the phenomenology of the model . in the following",
    "we will simply require @xmath16 so as to guarantee a perturbative treatment .",
    "notice , from , that the singlet couples to standard model fields only through the higgs boson and that such interaction is determined by the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the scalar potential was already presented in @xcite . here , we briefly review , for completeness , the constraints that the potential must satisfy . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "the scalar potential takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 is the higgs quartic coupling .",
    "the configuration @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a local minimum of @xmath22 provided that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "another local minimum , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , will exist whenever @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in such case , to ensure that the former is the potential s global minimum we must require that @xmath29 .",
    "once these conditions are satisfied , the s - dependent part of the potential can be rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 represents the physical higgs boson with mass @xmath33 . in the following",
    "we take @xmath34 and @xmath14 as the free parameters of the singlet scalar model .",
    "for @xmath35 and different values of the higgs mass.[rd ] ]    in this section we compute the relic density of the singlet scalar and use it to impose the dark matter constraint , @xmath36 @xcite . from it , we obtain the viable parameter space of the model with a singlet scalar .",
    "singlets can annihilate through s - channel higgs boson exchange into a variety of final states : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "additionally , they can also annihilate into @xmath40 either directly or through singlet exchange . as a general rule",
    ", the final state @xmath38 tends to dominate the total annihilation cross section whenever such channel is open .",
    "a light singlet , @xmath5 , will annihilate mainly into the @xmath41 final state .",
    "an intermediate mass singlet , @xmath42 , annihilates mostly into @xmath38 , with additional contributions from @xmath39 and , if allowed , @xmath40 . for a heavier singlet , @xmath43 ,",
    "the pattern is similar , as the @xmath44 channel gives a non - negligible but subdominant contribution .",
    "to accurately compute @xmath45 we use the micromegas package @xcite , which can calculate the relic density in a generic dark matter model .",
    "figure [ rd ] shows the relic density as a function of @xmath34 for @xmath35 and different values of the higgs mass .",
    "notice that the scalar singlet model can explain the dark matter naturally that is , without any fine - tuning in the parameters .",
    "indeed , for @xmath35 and @xmath34 around the electroweak scale , the predicted relic density lies in the correct range to be compatible with the observations .",
    "the most noticeable feature from this figure is the drastic suppression of the relic density that takes place at the higgs resonance .",
    "in fact , around @xmath46 the relic density is orders of magnitude smaller than anywhere else .",
    "the effect of the @xmath47 threshold is also seen to be important . above it , @xmath48 ,",
    "the @xmath38 annihilation channel is open and consequently the relic density tends to be smaller than below it .",
    "gev as reference values for the higgs mass .",
    "the grey area surrounding the line corresponding to @xmath49 gev shows the region compatible with the observed dark matter density at @xmath50.[pspace ] ]    it is clearly seen from figure [ rd ] that the value of the higgs mass , even if a standard model parameter , is critical for the computation of the singlet relic density . from direct searches at lep ,",
    "a lower limit on the higgs mass can be obtained , @xmath51 gev @xcite . when this bound is combined with electroweak precision measurements , an upper limit at",
    "the @xmath52 c. l. of @xmath53 gev @xcite is derived . throughout this paper",
    "we will use @xmath54 gev as reference values for the higgs mass .    for any given pair ( @xmath55,@xmath34 )",
    "there exists a unique value of @xmath14 such that the dark matter constraint , @xmath56 , is fulfilled . by imposing the dark matter constraint ,",
    "therefore , the variable @xmath14 can be effectively eliminated for given values of @xmath55 and @xmath34 , reducing the viable parameter space to a two dimensional volume . in figure [ pspace ]",
    "we show , in the plane ( @xmath14,@xmath34 ) , lines that are compatible with the observed dark matter density for different values of @xmath55 . away from the higgs resonance ,",
    "the typical value of @xmath14 is @xmath57 .",
    "light singlets , which annihilate mostly into @xmath41 , require larger values of @xmath14 to obtain the observed relic density .",
    "in contrast , at the higgs resonance , the annihilation tends to be more efficient and much smaller values of @xmath14 are needed to satisfy the dark matter constraint . to be concrete",
    ", we will not consider singlet masses above @xmath4 gev , though such high values are also allowed .",
    "figure [ pspace ] defines what we call the _ viable _ parameter space of the singlet scalar model . in the following",
    "we will compute the direct detection rates and the gamma ray flux only along these viable lines .",
    "for different values of the higgs mass .",
    "the thin lines show the present constraint from xenon10 and cdms .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the expected sensitivity of supercdms . along the lines @xmath58.[sip ] ]    dark matter particles can scatter elastically on nuclei and be detected through nuclear recoil in direct detection experiments . in the non - relativistic limit , the dark matter - nucleon amplitude receives two contributions : the scalar or spin - independent interaction and the axial - vector or spin - dependent part . for the singlet scalar ,",
    "the spin - dependent interaction vanishes so only the spin - independent part can give a signal .",
    "figure [ sip ] shows the spin - independent proton - singlet cross section as a function of the singlet scalar mass ( see @xcite to find out how this cross section is computed ) .",
    "since the higgs - singlets coupling is small close to the higgs resonance , see figure [ pspace ] , the cross section is highly suppressed in that region .",
    "a heavy singlet , @xmath59 gev , has an interaction cross section around @xmath60 .",
    "because the singlet interacts with nucleons via @xmath61-channel higgs exchange , the cross section typically decreases with the higgs mass , as observed in the figure . for reference , current constraints from xenon10 @xcite and cdms @xcite are also displayed .",
    "they rule out singlet masses below @xmath0 gev independently of the higgs mass .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of explaining the dama signal @xcite with a light singlet , @xmath62 gev , was recently explored in @xcite .",
    "finally , notice from the figure that future experiments , such as supercdms @xcite , will probe a significant region of the viable parameter space .",
    "the role of the indirect detection of dark matter that is , the detection of dark matter annihilation products is complementary to that of direct detection searches and will be crucial in future dark matter studies . in principle , dark matter annihilations could be observed through gamma rays , neutrinos , or antimatter . among them ,",
    "the simplest and more robust is the gamma ray signal .",
    "the gamma ray flux above some energy threshold @xmath63 from a direction forming an angle @xmath64 with respect to the galactic center can be expressed as    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the dimensionless line of sight integral around the direction @xmath64 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the average of @xmath66 over the spherical region of solid angle @xmath69 , @xmath70 from this expression we see that the gamma ray flux depends not only on particle physics parameters , such as @xmath71 and @xmath34 , but also on the unknown distribution of the dark matter , parameterized by @xmath72 .",
    "gev as a function of the singlet scalar mass .",
    "the predicted gamma flux is from a @xmath73 sr region around the galactic center for a nfw profile.[flux ] ]    in micromegas the photon spectrum from dark matter annihilations is obtained with a procedure similar to that implemented in darksusy @xcite .",
    "such procedure relies on the use of tables of @xmath74 production obtained from pythia @xcite for each of the different _ basic _ channels : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath38 and @xmath78 . concerning the distribution of dark matter , in our analysis we take a nfw profile @xcite , which has a @xmath79 behaviour at small @xmath80 , as the canonical example .",
    "for comparison we show , in table [ js ] , the value of @xmath68 for three different halo profiles including nfw and two typical values of @xmath69 .",
    ".values of @xmath81 for two different @xmath69 s and for three different density profiles .",
    "see @xcite for details.[js ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ flux ] shows the integrated gamma ray flux from the galactic center as a function of @xmath34 for different values of @xmath55 .",
    "all these models are compatible with the egret constraint @xcite .",
    "notice that the flux has a dip not only at the higgs resonance but also at the @xmath82 threshold .",
    "this latter feature is due to the effect known as annihilation into forbidden channels @xcite .",
    "the @xmath83 dependence , from ( [ eqflux ] ) , is clearly visible in the figure .",
    "lighter singlets generically yield a larger @xmath74 ray flux .     for different values of @xmath55 .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) line shows the @xmath71 required to observe a dm annihilation signal at @xmath84 significance with one year of fermi - glast data considering the conventional ( optimized ) diffuse model as background see figure 9 in @xcite .",
    "[ sigmav ] ]    even though the galactic center is expected to be the strongest source of @xmath74 rays from dm annihilation , it is not necessarily the best place to observe them . to do that",
    ", one must be able to distinguish the dm signal from the galactic diffuse background , a task that , given its large backgrounds , might be more difficult at the galactic center . in fact , a recent study , @xcite , found that , for a nfw profile , the fermi - glast sensitivity to a @xmath74 ray signal from the galactic halo ( excluding the center ) is larger than that from the galactic center compare figures @xmath85 and @xmath86 in @xcite . in the following , we will use those results , in particular figure @xmath86 , to determine the fermi - glast sensitivity to the singlet scalar model of dark matter .    in figure [ sigmav ]",
    "we show @xmath71 , at small @xmath87 , as a function of the singlet mass and different values of @xmath55 .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figure that away from the higgs resonance and the @xmath82 threshold @xmath71 is essentially constant and equal to the so - called typical annihilation cross section , @xmath88 .",
    "the dashed line shows the @xmath71 required to make an observation of dm annihilation at @xmath84 significance with one year of fgst data considering a _ conventional _ diffuse model @xcite as background .",
    "the dotted lines shows the analogous quantity but using the _ optimized _ diffuse model @xcite as background .",
    "these two lines were obtained by assuming that the region within @xmath89 of the gc is excluded from the analysis .",
    "notice from the figure that for the optimized model most of region with @xmath90 gev is `` detectable by fgst '' .",
    "for the conventional diffuse model , the detectable region extends to much higher masses .",
    "it is fair to say , therefore , that fermi - glast will probe a significant region of the parameter space of the singlet scalar model of dark matter .",
    "we have studied in detail the singlet scalar model of dark matter .",
    "first , we introduced the model and presented an updated analysis of its parameter space .",
    "the dark matter constraint was found to reduce the viable parameter space to just two variables : the singlet mass and the higgs mass .",
    "then , we computed the direct detection cross section and found that singlet masses below @xmath0 gev are already ruled out by the recent data from cdms and xenon10",
    ". finally , we calculated the expected gamma ray flux from the galactic center as well as the total annihilation cross section and showed that a significant region of the parameter space will be probed by fermi - glast .",
