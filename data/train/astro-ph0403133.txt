    "the nuclear stellar populations of galaxies can reveal important information on the history of nuclear star formation , which could then reveal the mechanisms behind triggering star formation .",
    "understanding nuclear stellar populations is therefore important to understanding the evolution of galaxies and the enhancement of star formation in the universe .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy is ideal for studying stellar populations because it traces not only the presence of hot young stars though near - infrared hydrogen recombination lines , such as the brackett @xmath1 line , but also the presence of red stars , particularly red supergiants , and the presence of shocks from supernovae activity .",
    "red supergiants and giants can be determined from the presence of various absorption features in the h- and k - bands , such as the co and si  i absorption features in the h - band and the co bands longward of 2.29  @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "supernova activity can be inferred from the presence of fe  ii emission lines associated with the supernova activity @xcite and possibly even molecular hydrogen line emission @xcite ( although molecular hydrogen line emission may be produced by other sources ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these diagnostics can be used together to characterize the different ages of the various stellar populations within galactic nuclei .",
    "once the nuclear stellar populations of spiral galaxies are well defined , they can be used to answer a number of specific scientific questions . to begin with",
    ", this will illuminate how star formation proceeds in the nuclei of `` normal '' spiral galaxies , and whether that star formation is either continuous or a series of short bursts .",
    "once we understand the functionality of star formation over time , we can determine how the nuclei of spiral galaxies have evolved .",
    "we can also determine how morphological features , particularly bars , or how environmental influences , such as interactions , influence nuclear star formation activity .",
    "additionally , we can probe the link between star formation activity and seyfert or liner activity .",
    "much of the work at near - infrared wavelengths has focues on unusual objects with either agn or very strong star formation activity .",
    "recent surveys include surveys of ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite , luminous infrared galaxies @xcite , starbursts @xcite , seyferts @xcite , liners @xcite , and interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , relatively little near - infrared spectroscopic survey has been done with `` normal '' nearby spiral galaxies ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "such surveys are necessary , though , for understanding nuclear star formation histories , for identifying the triggers that enhance nuclear star formation , and for setting a baseline for the h- and k - band emission from normal spiral galaxies .",
    "without such a baseline , the contribution of relatively quiescent stellar populations to h- and k - band emission in starbursts as well as the older stars contribution to the overall mass and luminosities in these systems will remain unknown , and the enhancement in star formation activity in exotic systems like ultraluminous infrared galaxies will have no context .    therefore , we have undertaken a near - infrared spectroscopic survey of a subset of the galaxies in the iso atlas of bright spiral galaxies ( @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper 1 ) with the purpose of understanding the nuclear stellar populations and star formation histories of these objects .",
    "the data includes k - band spectroscopy for 41 galaxies , with additional h - band spectroscopy for 20 galaxies .",
    "we first discuss in section  [ s_data ] the sample , the observations , and the data processing .",
    "next , we divide the galaxies into two groups : quiescent galaxies and non - quiescent galaxies . in section  [ s_quies ] , the spectra of the quiescent galaxies are described in detail , combined together to make a composite quiescent spectrum , and analyzed using population synthesis models .",
    "the non - quiescent galaxies are also described in detail in section  [ s_nonquies ] , with particular focus on how their nuclear star formation activity may be related to morphology , environment , and agn activity .",
    "after this , we determine the relative fractions of stars formed from starbursts in these systems .",
    "finally , in section  [ s_specphotcomp ] , we compare quiescent and non - quiescent galaxies in plots of the @xmath3 ratio to the @xmath4 or @xmath5 luminosities for the inner @xmath6 as an effort to justify using mid - infrared fluxes normalized by k - band fluxes ( used in @xcite , henceforth referred to as paper 2 ) to trace star formation activity .",
    "the galaxies in this iso bright galaxies project sample are a subset of a complete , magnitude - limited set of galaxies selected from the revised shapley - ames ( rsa ) catalog @xcite .",
    "the sample comprised galaxies with hubble types between s0 and sd and with magnitudes b@xmath7  =  12 or brighter ; galaxies in the virgo cluster were excluded .",
    "a randomly selected , subset of these galaxies was observed by iso based on target visibility .",
    "this produced a total of 77 galaxies that are representative of the range of hubble types in the rsa catalog .",
    "detailed information on the sample is presented in paper 1 .    of these 77 galaxies , we observed all targets that could be feasably observed with the the cgs4 infrared spectrometer at the united kingdom infrared telescope as well as some additional targets that were observable with the spex near - infrared spectrometer at the nasa infrared telescope facility @xcite .",
    "this presented two contraints on the subsample .",
    "the first was on the sensitivity of the instruments .",
    "we were effectively limited to working with targets where the continuum could be detected above the sky noise within 2  min because of the timescale of the variability of atmospheric emission lines that produced the background emission in our spectra .",
    "the other contraint was created by the declination range of the telescopes used .",
    "all observed targets had to fall within the declination range of @xmath8 .",
    "in the end , a subset of 41 galaxies in k - band and 20 galaxies in h - band were observed with one of the spectrometers with sufficient signal - to - noise in their spectra for analysis .",
    "details on the morphology , distances , and nuclear activity of this subsample are given in tabel  [ t_sample ] .",
    "details on specific information about the observations of individual galaxies are given in tables  [ t_obsinfok ] and [ t_obsinfoh ] .",
    "general information on the observations with each specific instrument is given below .",
    "spex observations were made on ut dates 5 - 8  june 2000 ; 16 , 17 , and 19  september  2000 ; and 4 - 5  april  2001 .",
    "each target was observed with the instrument in the short wavelength cross - dispersed mode , which covered a wavelength range from 0.8 to 2.5  @xmath2 m ( although we only use the 1.2 - 2.5  @xmath2 m range ) .",
    "the slit used was 0.5  @xmath9  15  @xmath10 , giving a spectral resolution of 1200 .",
    "the galaxies nuclei ( in the j- or k - band ) were centered in the slit and used for guiding in all cases .",
    "the observations consist of a series of alternating 2 min observations of the galaxies and 2 min observations of an empty region of sky @xmath02@xmath11 off the source , with total on - source integration times of 20 - 30  min .",
    "argon lamp spectra were taken for wavelength calibration , and quartz tungsten halogen ( qth ) lamp spectra were taken for flatfielding the spectra .",
    "an a0v star was observed as a spectroscopic standard for all targets , and , for targets observed in september 2000 and april 2001 , a g type star was also observed as a spectroscopic standard .",
    "the spectroscopic standards were selected to be as close to the target galaxies as possible , preferably within 10@xmath12 .",
    "these stars were observed using the same configuration and methods that the galaxies were observed with except that the integration times were shorter and that the stars observed in september 2000 and april 2001 were observed by nodding along the slit rather than completely off - source .",
    "cgs h- and k - band spectroscopic observations were made on ut dates 7 - 10 may 2001 .",
    "the observations were taken with the 40 lines mm@xmath13 grating , and the slit used was 0.5  @xmath9  15  @xmath10 , giving a spectral resolution of @xmath0800 . the galaxies nuclei ( in h- and k - band )",
    "were centered in the slit in all cases , and off - source point sources were used for guiding .",
    "the observations consist of a series of alternating 2 min observations of the galaxies and 2 min observations of an empty region of sky @xmath02@xmath11 off the source , with total on - source integration times of 20  min .",
    "bias frames were taken for removing systematic readout effects , argon lamp spectra were taken for wavelength calibration , and incandescent lamp spectra were taken for flatfielding the spectra .",
    "for each galaxy , a g type star was observed as a spectroscopic standard .",
    "the spectroscopic standards were selected to be as close to the target galaxies as possible , preferably within 10@xmath12 .",
    "these stars were observed using the same configuration and methods that the galaxies were observed with except that the integration times were shorted and that the stars were observed by nodding along the slit as opposed to completely off - source .",
    "first , the background frames were subtracted from the target frames .",
    "next , the frames were divided by the qth lamp frames .",
    "the individual orders were extracted from each frame , and spectra of the central sources were extracted from the h and k orders .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using argon arc lamp spectra .",
    "the slopes of the spectra were corrected to account for small changes in the waveband covered per pixel .",
    "next , the spectra from each frame were normalized relative to each other by performing a least - squares fit to solve for the scalar multiplier that minimized the differences between the first spectrum and subsequent specta . for each wavelength value ,",
    "the data were then combined in an iterative process where data points that deviated by more than 3 standard deviations from the median were removed until all data points were within three standard deviations of the median ; the median and standard deviation of the mean were then taken as the flux density measurement and the error at that wavelength .",
    "finally , the spectra were smoothed using a gaussian function .",
    "the spectroscopic standard was processed the same way , except that the blackbody emission was divided out and the hydrogen recombination lines were removed using one of two possible methods . in some cases , the lines were simply removed by fitting the sums of a voigt function and a continuum to the region with the line , then adding the voigt function to the spectra .",
    "this was most effective for removing the brackett-@xmath1 lines from a0v and g spectroscopic standards .",
    "other lines were removed by dividing the spectra by the spectra of previously observed stars of the same type .",
    "this was most effective for removing higher order brackett lines from the h - band spectra of a0v standards ( using data from @xcite ) .",
    "if both a0v and g type stars had been observed , then a spectroscopic standard spectrum was made by using the a0v spectrum but by replacing the region around the brackett-@xmath1 line with the spectrum from the g type star .",
    "otherwise , the full spectrum of the a0v star was used as the spectroscopic standard spectrum .",
    "once all the spectra were ready , the galaxy spectra were then divided by their corresponding spectroscopic standard spectra .",
    "data reduction for cgs4 data followed the data processing for spex data with some exceptions .",
    "first , only one linear order was present in the spectra , so no work needed to be done extracting the orders .",
    "second , since only g type spectroscopic standards were observed , only the brackett-@xmath1 line needed to be corrected in the k - band ; the hydrogen recombination lines were so weak in the h - band spectra that no corrections needed to be made .",
    "third , the sampling of the spectra performed during the observations produced a step pattern between odd and even pixels that needed to be removed from the individual spectroscopic standard spectra before they were median combined .",
    "33 of the 41 nuclear k - band spectra we examined had nearly identical spectra with identical qualitative characteristics :    - the spectra all have similar slopes , at least from 2.10  @xmath2 m to the edge of the fist co band at 2.29  @xmath2 m .",
    "- the spectra all contain strong co absorption lines that are characteristically found in k and m stars ( see examples in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "- the spectra all contain various metal absorption features , most notably the na i lines at 2.206 and 2.209  @xmath2 m and the ca i lines at 2.261 , 2.263 , and 2.266  @xmath2 m , that are most prominent in k and m stars ( see examples in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "- no brackett-@xmath1 emission lines are evident in the spectra .",
    "although ionized gas may be present , the negligible recombination line flux in the k - band implies relatively few young stars and therefore relatively little recent star formation activity .    - no h@xmath14 lines are evident in the spectra .",
    "if h@xmath14 line emission is interpreted as originating from shocks connected to supernova activity , then the lack of these lines in the spectra of these galaxies implies that nuclear supernova activity is relatively weak or nonexistent .",
    "the h - band spectra for 15 of these 33 `` quiescent '' spectra share similar characteristics to the k - band spectra :    - the spectra al have similar slopes within the 1.55 - 1.75 @xmath2 m wavelength range .    - the spectra all contain strongly defined co absorption bands that are characteristically found in k and m stars ( see examples in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "- the spectra contain metal absorption lines , such as the 1.589  @xmath2 m si  i line and the 1.711  @xmath2 m mg i line , that are characteristically found in cooler stars ( see @xcite and @xcite for examples ) .",
    "- the spectra contain no fe  ii 1.644  @xmath2 m line emission , which is associated with supernova activity .",
    "we display these 33 `` quiescent '' k - band spectra in figure  [ f_allquiesspeck ] and the corresponding `` quiescent '' h - band spectra in figure  [ f_allquiesspech ] .",
    "the uniformity of the spectra is quite striking , especially when they are compared to samples of other classes of objects .",
    "the lirgs studied in @xcite or the interacting galaxies studied in @xcite , for example , have variable spectral slopes , and the strengths of brackett-@xmath1 and h@xmath14 lines are variable .",
    "in contrast , the slopes of the spectra of these quiescent galaxies are uniform , and the relative strengths of absorption features is consistent throughout the group .",
    "based on the spectra of these objects , it is very clear that the k - band emission from these objects is dominated entirely by old red stars that dominate the central bulges of these galaxies .",
    "we see such a large collection of spectra as an excellent opportunity . by combining these spectra together",
    ", we can create a composite `` quiescent '' spectrum .",
    "this quiescent spectrum could then be treated as representing an old red stellar component in the spectra of galaxies where either continuum emission from an agn source or hot dust or emission lines from young stars or supernovae or are present .    to build a quiescent k - band spectrum , we began by selecting the 32 of the 33 galaxies above that were s0 or spiral galaxies .",
    "( ngc  5846 is classified by the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies @xcite ( rc3 ) as an elliptical galaxy and was therefore left out of this analysis .",
    "composite spectra made from only s0s or only spiral galaxies differed a statistically insignificant amount from each other , so we used the s0 and spiral galaxies together . )",
    "we first redshift - corrected all of the spectra to the rest frame .",
    "next , we finely resampled the spectra from 2.0  @xmath2 m to 2.4",
    "@xmath2 m at intervals of @xmath15  @xmath2 m using a spline procedure .",
    "we then normalized the spectra and median combined them using the same method we used to normalize and combine the spectra for individual galaxies .",
    "a similar procedure was followed to produce quiescent h - band spectra except that the 14 spectra that were used were resampled from 1.55  @xmath2 m to 1.75  @xmath2 m at intervals of @xmath15  @xmath2 m .",
    "we show the resulting quiescent spectra in figure  [ f_quiesspectrumk ] and figure  [ f_quiesspectrumh ] .",
    "spectral features , namely the metal absorption lines and the co bandheads , were identified using spectral line data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "tables  [ t_quieskline ] and [ t_quieshline ] list the identified features .      to better understand the composite spectrum",
    ", we will analyze measurements of features in the spectrum using the starburst99 @xcite population synthesis models .",
    "starburst99 only considers two star formation scenarios : an instantaneous burst of star formation , and continuous star formation . we will consider both scenarios in our analysis .",
    "we used most of the default input choices for starburst99 with the exception of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we used solar metallicities because we assume that the galaxies used to build the composite quiescent spectrum should have similar metallicities to the milky way . although we will primarily focus on model results that depend on using a salpeter imf with a slope of 2.35 and an upper mass cutoff of 100  m@xmath16",
    ", we will also briefly mention the implications of using either an imf with a slope of 2.35 and an upper mass cutoff of 30 m@xmath16 or an imf with a slope of 3.30 and an upper mass cutoff of 100 m@xmath16 .",
    "several different near - infrared spectroscopic indicators are modeled in starburst99 , but only a few of these indicators trace older stellar populations .",
    "we will use starburst99 s predictions of the equivalent widths of the si 1.59  @xmath2 m line , the co  6 - 3 feature at 1.62  @xmath2 m , and the co  2 - 0 feature at 2.29  @xmath2 m ( @xcite describe the motivations for using these lines in near - infrared spectral analysis ) .",
    "table  [ t_quiesmeas ] list measurements of these features using the `` line '' and continuum locations described in @xcite .",
    "errors in the line measurements are dominated not by random errors in the measurements of the spectral lines but in systematic errors related to the wavelength calibration of the spectrum .",
    "figure  [ f_s99inst ] shows plots of starburst99 s predictions of the equivalent widths over time after an instantaneous burst of star formation that produces a salpeter imf .",
    "the spectral line measurements and errors , overlaid as horizontal lines , all cross the model at two locations in these plots .",
    "the most representative times have been determined quantitatively by searching for the location where the @xmath17 value is minimized .",
    "the @xmath17 value for time t is given by @xmath18 where w@xmath19 is the measured equivalent width for line i , @xmath20 is the error in the measurement , and w(t)@xmath21 is the modeled equivalent width at time t.    the first location at @xmath07  myr seems less likely to be representative of the stellar populations . at this time after the burst , the bluest stars on the main sequence are beginning to evolve into red supergiants , which have atmospheres dominated by molecular and metal absorption lines . however , as massive stars are evolving past the red supergiant phase , supernova activity is quite strong at this point in time , which implies that shock excitation lines such as the fe  ii and h@xmath14 emission lines should be quite strong in the composite quiescent spectrum , which is not the case .",
    "furthermore , the stellar populations are evolving rapidly , which would suggest much more variation in the spectral features than what is found among the quiescent galaxies .",
    "the other location at @xmath0180  myr seems to be more representative of the nuclear stellar populations . at this stage in stellar evolution , most massive stars have completely evolved and no longer significantly contribute to the h- or k - band emission in these objects .",
    "neither supernovae nor ionizing stars are present , so no strong emission lines are expected .",
    "what is left is an old , red stellar population that will produce continuum emission that includes metal and molecular absorption features .",
    "@xcite do caution that interpretation of stellar populations older than 100  myr , particularly using near - infrared absorption features , is problematic because of difficulty in modeling asymtotic giant branch stars .",
    "we will therefore treat the starburst99 output as a rough characterization of the actual stellar populations .",
    "given the approximate age of the system , it is possible to estimate the ratio of k - band luminosity to the mass of the system for this particular case . from starburst99",
    ", a @xmath22  m@xmath16 system will lose @xmath23  m@xmath16 of its mass through stellar winds and supernovae , thus leaving @xmath24  m@xmath16 in stars .",
    "the k - band absolute magnitude at this time is @xmath25 , which corresponds to a power of @xmath26  w. this gives a k - band luminosity - to - mass conversion factor of @xmath27  m@xmath16  w@xmath13 .",
    "the other imfs considered here , which are weighted more strongly towards low mass stars , do produce results that differ from the salpeter imf .",
    "the age of the stellar population does not change when a smaller upper mass cutoff is used and changes an insignificant amount if an imf with a steeper slope is used . in these scenarios , however , less of the total initial mass is lost through supernovae or stellar winds because less mass is in stars that would have high mass loss through stellar winds or that would undergo supernovae explosions .",
    "this results in the luminosity - to - mass conversion factor varying somewhat among the three imf scenarios , but it does not vary by orders of magnitude .    in summary , the results from the starburst99 simulations demonstrate that an old stellar population formed in an instantaneous burst can reproduce the observed composite quiescent spectrum as well as the spectra of the galaxies used to build the quiescent spectrum . changing the output imf in starburst99 will still lead to a stellar population that can reproduce the measured absorption line features .",
    "figure  [ f_s99cont ] shows plots of starburst99 s predictions of the equivalent widths over time after the onset of continuous star formation that produces a salpeter imf .",
    "the spectral line measurements and errors , overlaid as horizontal lines , all cross the model at two locations in these plots .",
    "the earlier crossing , at a time of @xmath010  myr , seems an unreasonable alternative for reasons similar for those given above for the earlier time in the instantaneous burst models .",
    "this leaves the later time as a given alternative . in this case",
    ", the age of the stellar population is @xmath0730  myr .",
    "the reason for this greater age than in the instantaneous burst scenario is that the continuous star formation continuously adds red supergiants with absorption features .",
    "therefore , more time is needed for stars with shallower absorption features to dominate the spectrum and match these measurements .",
    "for a few reasons , the continuous star formation scenario is more problematic than the instantaneous burst scenario .",
    "first of all , the si , co 2 - 0 , and co 6 - 3 equivalent widths do not all correspond to similar times after the onset of star formation .",
    "the si and co 2 - 0 equivalent widths correspond to an age of 600 - 800  myr , whereas the co 6 - 3 equivalent width corresponds to an age of 2  gyr or later .",
    "the discrepancy between the two measurements suggests that the continuous star formation scenario provides the wrong mix of k and m stars to reproduce the stellar population .",
    "more importantly , however , the continuous star formation scenario predicts a brackett-@xmath1 equivalent width of @xmath030    at @xmath0730  myr .",
    "no brackett-@xmath1 feature within a magniture of being that strong is evident in the composite quiescent spectrum .",
    "furthermore , no shock excitation lines are observed , even though supernova activity is continuous in this scenario .",
    "using other imfs does not solve the problem . using a steeper imf or decreasing the upper mass cutoff",
    "does improve the match between the measured and modeled absorption features , but the discrepancy among the best corresponding times for each equivalent width measurement persists .",
    "moreover , the other imf model results still suggest detectable brackett-@xmath1 equivalent widths .",
    "we conclude that changing the imf slightly improves the match between the starburst99 output and the measurements , but the resulting simulated stellar population still can not plausibly represent the observed spectra .",
    "ultimately , the data suggests that the instantaneous burst scenario can reproduce the spectra we have observed but the continuous star formation scenario can not .",
    "this seems to be consistant with previous studies of nuclear star formation as well @xcite .",
    "we will therefore treat the stellar populations of the nuclei of these quiescent galaxies as though they formed in an instantaneous burst 180  myr ago .",
    "however , these results should be used cautiously .",
    "the results should not be interpreted as indicating that all of the stars in the quiescent galaxies nuclei formed in one burst of star formation 180  myr ago .",
    "galaxies are known to be older than 180  myr , and the star formation histories are expected to be more complex . the age should also not be interpreted as an average age , since the line widths do not vary linearly with time . instead , the age should be treated as a representative value that can be used with the starburst99 models to approximate the stellar populations that predominate the near - infrared emission .",
    "future refinements in modeling near - infrared absorption features with population synthesis models , the inclusion of more absorption features in the models , and advances in modeling stellar populations beyond 100  myr will improve the characterization of the ages of the stellar populations in these quiescent systems . for now , however , we will work with these results from starburst99 .",
    "the viability of the instantaneous burst scenario for the quiescent galaxies suggests that sources with h- and k - band emission lines are comprised of a younger starburst embedded within an older stellar population that is similar to the quiescent stellar population .",
    "we apply this interpretation throughout the following secion .",
    "only the nuclear h- and k - band spectra of eight galaxies exhibited any emission lines .",
    "some of these galaxies are systems with complex stellar structures in their nuclei that we will discuss in detail in the section  [ s_nonquies_complex ] .",
    "the other systems have strong line emission from pointlike nuclei ; their spectra are presented as they are discussed .",
    "interestingly , not all nuclei and other structures that produce emission lines have characteristically similar spectra .",
    "we discuss a few of the qualitative variations below , and we provide table  [ t_nonquiesmeas ] to show how the spectra differ quantitatively . in most cases , the underlying continua and absorption lines for these systems closely matches the quiescent composite spectra derived above with some minor exceptions in the slope of the spectra .",
    "this implies that any recent starburst activity lies deeply buried within an older population of evolved stars .      in ngc  289 ,",
    "ngc  5713 , and part of the nuclear regions of ngc  4100 , strong h@xmath14 lines , brackett-@xmath1 lines , and fe  ii lines ( when h - band data are available ) were detected . otherwise , the galaxies h- and",
    "k - band spectra almost match the quiescent composite spectra .",
    "figures  [ f_specn0289 ] and [ f_specn5713 ] show the spectra for ngc  289 and ngc  5713 with the quiescent h- and k - band spectra overlaid .",
    "( spectra and data for ngc  4100 are presented in section  [ s_nonquies_complex ] . ) at this stage in galaxy evolution , it appears that these systems are seen at a time during which ionizing stars have not completely evolved off the main sequence but supernovae are occuring . according to simulation results from starburst99",
    ", these conditions are met for an instantaneous burst in the 3.5 - 8  myr age range for a salpeter imf .",
    "the a cluster in ngc  1569 , part of the nuclear region of ngc  3556 , and the nucleus of ngc  4088 exhibit strong brackett-@xmath1 lines but nondetectable h@xmath14 and fe  ii lines ( when h - band data are available ) .",
    "he  i lines may also be present , although it may be relatively weak compared to the hydrogen emission .",
    "this helium emission may be a qualitative tracer of o type stars with very strong winds @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  4088 is plotted in figure  [ f_specn4088 ] .",
    "( ngc  1569 and ncg  3556 are discussed in more detail in section  [ s_nonquies_complex ] . )",
    "the recombination lines indicate that young ionizing stars are present , but the lack of shock excitation lines suggests that the stellar population has not evolved to a point where supernovae are generating shocks in the interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , using starburst99 data , the stellar population must be less than 3.5  myr old .",
    "finally , the galaxies ngc  5005 and ngc  5033 exhibit strong h@xmath14 and fe  ii lines from shock excitation but either weak or nonexistent brackett-@xmath1 emission .",
    "interestingly , the k - band continua of these galaxies do not match the composite quiescent spectrum .",
    "the slopes of the two galaxies differ from the quiescent spectrum , and the observed co bands in ngc  5033 are shallower than most other galaxies .",
    "however , the continua can be fit by a linear combination of the composite quiescent spectrum and a power law .",
    "table  [ t_n5005 - 5033pw ] provides basic data on the underlying power laws in the k - band .",
    "note that these power law fits are only approximations as they are highly sensitive to the exact regions of the k - band continuum used in the fits .",
    "figures  [ f_specn5005 ] and [ f_specn5033 ] show the spectra for these galaxies along with the best fitting continua .",
    "the absence of strong recombination lines indicates that ngc  5005 and ngc  5033 have at least evolved past 8  myr .",
    "if the shock excitation lines are interpreted as originating from supernovae , then we could conclude that the stellar populations in these galaxies are in the 8 - 36  myr age range .",
    "however , these two galaxies are interacting with each other @xcite .",
    "the shock excitation lines may simply be tracing cloud collisions from interaction - induced gas infalls into these galaxies nuclei .",
    "since ngc  5005 is classified as a liner and ngc  5033 is classified as a seyfert @xcite ( hfs97b ) , another possibility is that the shock excitation lines are the results of gas outflows from agn .",
    "the presence of additional continuum emission could be further proof of agn in these galaxies .",
    "however , when we discuss the near- and mid - infrared colors and luminosities in section  [ s_specphotcomp ] , we will discuss additional evidence that the shock excitation lines may arise from supernovae .      in this section",
    ", we discuss unusual targets with either complex nuclear structure or unusual star clusters outside their nuclei that also had spectra taken .",
    "all of the galaxies listed below produce detectable emission lines in at least one location .",
    "ngc  1569 contains two prominent star clusters .",
    "these star clusters are identified in figure  [ f_imgn1569 ] .",
    "this is a well - studied system where the stellar populations have been identified @xcite , so these observations provide few new insights into the galaxy itself .",
    "however , the results should be considered within the context of the sample as a whole , particularly since this is one of the few galaxies in the sample where emission lines have been detected in the spectroscopy .",
    "figures  [ f_specn1569a ] and [ f_specn1569b ] present the spectra of ngc  1569a and ngc  1569b . ngc  1569a exhibits strong brackett-@xmath1 emission and he  ii emission but no detectable fe  ii or h@xmath14 emission .",
    "ngc  1569b , however , produces no strong near - infrared emission lines .",
    "otherwise , ngc  1569a , along with ngc  1569b , have similar continua with similar absorption features .    at first glance , the h and k continua appear to match the composite quiescent spectrum very well .",
    "however , a closer look at the spectral line emission indicates that the absorption features in the ngc  1569 spectra do not match the composite quiescent spectrum .",
    "note , for example , the missing al   and mg   features near 2.11  @xmath2 m and the apparent absense of the ca   triplet near 2.26  @xmath2 m .",
    "these lines may all be missing because ngc  1569 , as a dwarf , has a lower metallicity than most nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , note the deeper co features in the spectrum of ngc  1569b .",
    "this indicates that the b cluster may contain higher - mass red giants than the average galactic nucleus and that it may be younger than 180  myr .",
    "nonetheless , the data imply that a starburst less than 3.5  myr old is embedded within an older stellar population in ngc  1569a and that ngc  1569b consists of an older stellar population .",
    "these results are consistent with most previous studies .",
    "the lack of detection of shock excitation lines in the near - infrared spectra is also consistent with @xcite , which did not detect any supernovae at radio wavelengths .",
    "the nuclear region of ngc  3556 contains two regions of similar surface brightness but different shape .",
    "figure  [ f_imgn3556 ] shows a k - band image of these regions , which we will refer to as the east and west nuclear regions of ngc  3556 .",
    "although the two regions are relatively close to each other , their k - band spectra are stunningly different .",
    "figure  [ f_specn3556 ] shows the spectra of the east and west nuclear regions , with the composite quiescent spectrum overlaid on each spectrum .",
    "the underlying continua for both objects has the same slope as the composite quiescent spectrum and do feature similar co absorption features , although most other absorption features are so poorly distinguished that the match between the spectra and the composite is not as clear as in other cases .",
    "the east nuclear region appears to be a relatively quiescent region .",
    "the west nuclear region , however , exhibits strong he  i and brackett-@xmath1 line emission that implies the presence of a stellar population that is less than 3  myr old .",
    "based on images and information from the literature , ngc  4100 seems to be an unspectacular sbc galaxy with neither seyfert nor liner nuclear activity ( hfs97b ) .",
    "a close examination of the nucleus in the k - band , however , reveals that the nucleus actually has a knotted structure , as seen in figure  [ f_imgn4100nuc ] .",
    "the spectroscopy of the target also produces some intriguing results , as seen in figure  [ f_specn4100 ] .",
    "the k - band spectrum of the center of the galaxy simply appears quiescent .",
    "the spectrum of the region just south of the center of the galaxy , however , reveals the presence of detectable brackett-@xmath1 and molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "gas falling into the nucleus of this galaxy may have created the star formation structure in this galaxy s center . given the complexity of the structure ,",
    "we suggest that the nucleus of ngc  4100 should be observed with an integral field spectrometer so as to better understand the locations of photionizing stars , evolved red stars , and shocks in the system as well as to determine the overall masses in young and old stars .",
    "the complex nuclear star formation region of ngc  4100 may be significantly more extended than the slit used for the observations .",
    "therefore , we have declined to use ngc  4100 in any of the quantitative analysis , and we do not report any emission line equivalent widths or luminosities . however , we still use ngc  4100 qualitatively in the discussion .      the observations of ngc 5676 not only allowed us to examine the spectra of the nucleus but also of a bright knot of star formation north of the nucleus .",
    "this knot stood out prominently in the 12  @xmath2 m image presented in paper 1 . at that wavelength ,",
    "the surface brightness of the northern knot was higher than the surface brightness of the nucleus .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the k - band image of the galaxy , where the nucleus clearly has a surface brightness that is higher than any region within the disk even though the northern knot is a prominent source of k - band emission in the disk . clearly , some kind of extraordinary star formation event is taking place in the northern knot .",
    "the k - band spectroscopy reveals more clues as to exactly what is happening .",
    "figure  [ f_specn5676 ] shows the k - band spectrum of the the northern knot of ngc  5676 .",
    "the region produces very strong brackett-@xmath1 and he  i emission that dominates the k - band emission .",
    "otherwise , no other emission or absorption features are discernable in the northern knot s spectrum .",
    "the presence of the he  i lines and the lack of h@xmath14 shock excitation lines suggests that this system is younger than 3  myr .    clearly , the northern knot is a large , young star formation complex that may represent an important stage in the evolution of disk stars not only in ngc  5676 but in other galaxies as well .",
    "further spectroscopic observations of the complex would allow for the calculation of the total mass of this system and could even be used to look for dynamical clues as to how this complex formed .",
    "the occurence of h- and k - band emission lines in only a few galaxies leads us to examine what factors lead to the production of these features",
    ". we will consider morphological and environmental factors that could possibly be triggers or conditions for the star formation activity we observed .",
    "we will also discuss the implications of our results for better understanding agn activity , particularly liners .      from looking at the morphological types of all the non - quiescent galaxies ,",
    "it is clear that location along the hubble sequence is a major factor . of the eight non - quiescent galaxies , all of them are classified in rc3 as sbc galaxies or later types",
    "this clearly supports the paradigm that the relative strength of star formation increases along the hubble sequence , even though @xcite states that this trend is primarily one seen in the disks of spiral galaxies , not in their nuclei .",
    "the finding agrees with the photometric results reported in paper 2 .",
    "this also agrees well with the results presented in @xcite , where composite near - infrared spectra made for different morphological types of galaxies show that recombination and shock excitation line emission is most prominent in late - type galaxies .",
    "the results presented here probably reflect the change along the hubble sequence in the relative contributions of bulge stars to the h- and k - band emission . in s0s and early - type spiral galaxies , which are defined as having large bulges",
    ", the bulge stars dominate the near - infrared emission . if any star formation was present , the recombination line emission is relatively insignificant compared to the bulge star continuum emission and therefore extremely difficult to detect . in late - type spiral galaxies , however , fewer bulge stars are present by definition .",
    "therefore , if star formation is present , the lower continuum from the bulge stars allows for the detection of recombination lines .    nonetheless , not all late - type spiral nuclei produce detectable brackett-@xmath1 or shock excitation line emission , as quite a large number of the near - infrared spectra of sbc - scd galaxies are quiescent .",
    "although location along the hubble sequence is a necessary factor for the h- and k - band line emission , it appears to not be a sufficient factor .",
    "bars have often been suggested as a means by which gas may be funneled into the nuclei of galaxies , thus leading to enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "several studies have found a difference between the nuclear star formation activity of barred and unbarred spiral galaxies , although the differences are mainly seen in early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "six of the eight non - quiescent galaxies in this sample are at least weakly barred according to rc3 , although only three are identified as strongly barred .",
    "however , two of the galaxies are identified as unbarred : ngc  4100 and ngc  5033 . the k - band image of ngc  4100 in paper 1 hints at the possibility of a bar , but ngc  5033 is unquestionably unbarred .",
    "given that many of these non - quiescent galaxies are only weakly barred and that at least one is unbarred , it seems as though bars are not absolutely necessary for triggering nuclear star formation .",
    "furthermore , some of the observed late - type barred spiral galaxies have quiescent near - infrared spectra , suggesting that bars do not directly correspond to enhanced star formation activity .",
    "interactions have been proposed as a means of triggering or enhancing star formation in the nuclei of galaxies by driving gas inward , even before the interacting galaxies begin to merge @xcite .",
    "observations of nuclear star formation confirm these effects @xcite .    in the non - quiescent galaxies in this sample , four of them are interacting .",
    "ngc  289 is interacting with a dwarf companion @xcite , ngc  4088 is interacting with ngc  4085 @xcite , and ngc  5005 and ngc  5033 are interacting with each other @xcite . the nuclear star formation activity in the three interacting barred galaxies could just as easily be explained as being caused by the interaction as its is explained as being caused by the bar , especially in light of such studies as @xcite that discuss bars forming in interactions and causing gas infall . for ngc  5033 , which is unbarred , the interaction is the only obviious mechanism for explaining why signs of star formation ( or at least shocked gas ) are found in the nucleus .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that ngc  5005 and ngc  5033 have very similar spectra .",
    "if the shock excitation line emission from these two galaxies is interpreted as coming from supernovae produced from starburst events , then the events may have occured nearly - simultaneously in both galaxies .",
    "this would be a powerful demonstration of the effects of interactions on nuclear star formation activity if it could be confirmed .",
    "two additional non - quiescent galaxies , ngc  1569 and ngc  5713 , have lopsided , amorphous appearances .",
    "that suggest that they may have experienced recent minor merger events .",
    "such minor merger events are capable of enhancing nuclear star formation activity @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would suggest that these galaxies have recently undergone minor mergers that has triggered their nuclear star formation activity .",
    "these results demonstrate that interactions are as important as bars in triggering nuclear star formation activity .",
    "ngc  3556 and ngc  4100 , however , are examples of non - interacting systems with current nuclear star formation , which demonstrates that interactions are sufficient but not necessary for triggering nuclear bursts .",
    "moreover , not all interacting galaxies show near - infrared spectroscopic signs of recent star formation activity .",
    "several of the quiescent galaxies in this sample are also interacting , including ngc  1512 @xcite , ngc  4725 @xcite , ngc  5457 @xcite , ngc  5566 @xcite , ngc  5746 @xcite , ngc  5846 @xcite , ngc  5866 @xcite , and ngc  5907 @xcite .",
    "many , but not all , of these quiescent interacting galaxies are early type spirals with large bulges .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that large bulges can inhibit the infall of nuclear gas into galactic nuclei during interactions , which may explain why most of the interacting quiescent galaxies in this sample do not exhibit nuclear near - infrared line emission .",
    "the relation between the agn activity ( as determined from optical spectroscopy ) and the h- and k - band spectroscopy can provide additional clues in understanding the underlying mechanisms behind the nuclear activity .    in seyferts ,",
    "the question has been how the agn activity may be related to star formation .",
    "several studies , including ultraviolet and optical observations @xcite , near - infrared spectroscopic surveys @xcite , far - infrared surveys @xcite , and co surveys @xcite have found evidence for relatively recent circumnuclear star formation in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies show no signs of being associated with star formation activity , although intermediate classes between 1 and 2 may be .",
    "the emerging paradigm suggests that seyfert 2 activity appears on the order of 10  myr after an instantaneous starburst .",
    "according to starburst99 , supernova activity should be prevalent , near - infrared recombination lines will be undetectable , and absorption features will generally be deeper than average .",
    "however , some infrared surveys of seyferts , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite note that the absorption features could be diluted by continuum emission from the agn .",
    "nonetheless , these studies have presented us with a model that can be compared to observations .    in liners , near - infrared spectroscopy is particularly important . with both photoionization and shock excitation lines ,",
    "more constraints can be placed on whether the optical spectra of liners are produced by photoionization by either clusters of young stars @xcite or agn @xcite or by shock excitation from supernovae produced in a starburst or agn @xcite .",
    "as has been discussed by @xcite , near - infrared fe  ii and recombination lines can be the key to distinguishing between shock excitation and photoionization results .",
    "we will rely on the classifications of hfs97b in this discussion .",
    "two of the eight non - quiescent galaxies in this sample are not classified by hfs97b , although the nasa / ipac extragalactic database lists one of them as an h  ii galaxy .",
    "four of the six non - quiescent galaxies are also identified by hfs97b as h  ii galaxies .",
    "this leaves one seyfert ( ngc  5033 ) and one liner ( ngc  5005 ) as agn with detected h and k spectral line emission .",
    "only two galaxies observed in this spectroscopic survey were classified as seyferts by hfs97b .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum of ngc  4725 was quiescent .",
    "hfs97b , however , state that the classification of ngc  4725 is uncertain ; perhaps the non - detection of emission lines along with the lack of a continuum that dilutes the absorption features indicates that this galaxy is not a seyfert . the near - infrared spectrum of ngc  5033 , however , exhibited weak but broad brackett-@xmath1 emission as well as strong shock excitation line emission .",
    "the broad brackett-@xmath1 line clearly indicates the presence of an agn .",
    "the shock excitation lines , however , could be interpreted as originating from the agn , from the interaction with ngc  5005 , or from a circumnuclear starburst . if it is a circumnuclear starburst , this would show the same kind of association between seyfert optical spectral activity and star formation activity that had been found previously .",
    "unfortunately , this sample lacks enough seyferts to really make a definitive statement about them , although many other surveys in the literature ( see references in section  [ s_intro ] ) could make stronger statements .",
    "seven of the galaxies in this spectroscopic sample were classified as liners by hfs97b .",
    "another nine were classified as transition objects , which may be more closely related to liners than to other classes of objects .",
    "however , near - infrared emission lines were only detected in one of these 16 objects , ngc  5005 .",
    "this is a relatively low rate of detection compared to the h  ii galaxies , where 4 of 13 galaxies in the sample classified as such by hfs97b had detected near - infrared line emission .",
    "however , these results are consistent with other studies ; @xcite and @xcite also present near - infrared liner spectra that have no detectable emission lines .    in ngc  5005 ,",
    "the characteristic strong shock excitation lines , particularly the fe  ii lines , and the absense of recombination lines are consistent with other near - infrared spectroscopy observations of liners @xcite . in this target , it is obvious that shocks are propagating through the nucleus , photoionization is relatively weak , and therefore the optical liner emission is probably generated by shock excitation .    in the other 13 objects ,",
    "though , the absence of all near - infrared emission lines and the close match between the near - infrared spectra of these galaxies and the near - infrared spectra of other quiescent galaxies indicate that the spectra are dominated by evolved red stars .",
    "if shock excitation or photoionization by hot young stars is taking place in the nuclei of these liners , the emission is weak compared to the continuum emission from the older quiescent stellar populations .",
    "if the non - detection of near - infrared spectral lines are interpreted as the absence of shocks or star formation , then only weak agn may be responsible for the optical emission line spectra .",
    "the relatively low nuclear 12  @xmath2 m flux to k - band flux ratios determined for the galaxies in this sample in paper 2 also indicated that nuclear star formation is relatively weak in liners and transition objects compared to h  ii galaxies .",
    "these additional spectroscopic observations demonstrate that evolved red stars dominate the near - infrared emission in these systems and that photoionization from star formation is unlikely to be causing the optical liner emission observed in these galaxies .",
    "the total mass formed within the most recent starburst event can be determined using measurements of the brackett-@xmath1 or fe  ii 1.644  @xmath2 m luminosities .",
    "we will use data from starburst99 to determine the conversion factors from these line luminosities to young stellar masses .",
    "we treat the star formation as though it takes place in an instantaneous burst .",
    "we assume that the metallicities are solar and that the imf of the burst has a slope of 2.35 and an upper mass cutoff of 100  m@xmath16 .",
    "note that , for convenience , the data used to calculate the conversion values correspond to a simulated burst that forms @xmath22  m@xmath16 in stars . the luminosities and masses presented below are dependent on the initial mass , but the final conversion factors are mass - independent .",
    "we will begin by finding conversion factors between brackett-@xmath1 luminosity and total young stellar mass . as we stated above in discussing the ages of",
    "the young stellar populations , the appearance or nondetection of certain spectral lines indicate different ages for the systems .",
    "we therefore divide the galaxies with brackett-@xmath1 line detections into two categories : pre - supernova systems ( systems with ages of 0.0 - 3.5  myr that exhibit no shock excitation lines ) and supernova systems with recombination line emission ( systems with ages of 3.5 - 8.0  myr that have detectable shock excitation lines ) .",
    "table  [ t_brgconvert ] presents starburst99 data on the range and median value of brackett-@xmath1 luminosities , the stellar masses remaining in the systems , and the conversion factors from brackett-@xmath1 luminosities to masses for these two types of systems .",
    "note that the large change in the brackett-@xmath1 luminosities in the 3.5 - 8.0  myr range mean that the young stellar masses determined from the line luminosities will only be accurate to within a factor of 10 .    to use the fe  ii 1.644  @xmath2 m emission lines to trace young stellar masses",
    ", we must select a conversion factor that changes supernova rates into fe  ii line luminosities .",
    "we will use @xmath28  w  yr , which was determined by @xcite .",
    "this agrees within a factor of 2 with the conversion factor of @xmath29  w  yr determined in @xcite ( using their assumptions on the scalar factor @xmath30 and assuming that their ( e@xmath31/@xmath32 erg ) term is equal to unity ) .",
    "these conversion factors , however , disagree with the conversion factor of @xmath33  w  yr determined in @xcite ( using their assumptions presented about the fe  ii luminosity of supernova remnants and the duration of fe  ii emission ) .",
    "however , @xcite and references therein state that the fe  ii emission should last longer than what is assumed in @xcite , which could partly explain why the @xcite conversion factors are inconsistent with other values .    as with the galaxies with brackett-@xmath1 emission , galaxies with fe  ii emission",
    "can be split into two groups : supernova systems with recombination line emission ( which have ages of 3.5 - 8.0  myr ) and supernova systems without recombination line emission ( which have ages of 8.0 - 36  myr ) .",
    "table  [ t_feiiconvert ] presents data on the range and median of supernova rates , the corresponding median fe  ii 1.644  @xmath2 m line luminosities , the total stellar mass remaining in the systems , and the line luminosity - to - mass conversion factors .    to calculate the ratios of young to old stars in the non - quiescent galaxies using the k - band flux to trace the older stars , we will need to subtract the total contribution of the young stars .",
    "the k - band flux within younger stars can simply be determined by multiplying the brackett-@xmath1 and fe  ii line fluxes by ratios of the k - band continuum fluxes to line fluxes predicted by starburst99 .",
    "table  [ t_contlinerat ] presents these data for the three different age ranges discussed above .",
    "note that these correction factors are only good to within a factor of 10 , mainly because the k continuum flux varies by a factor of 10 within the selected time periods .",
    "however , as we will see below , these values will work for the science that we are doing .      using the k continuum luminosity to old stellar mass conversion factor derived in section  [ s_quies_synth ] and these conversion factors between line luminosities and young stellar mass",
    ", we can now measure both the mass produced in these nuclear star formation events ( for at least the regions falling within the slit ) and the ratio of young stellar mass to total stellar mass in the nuclei of these galaxies . for objects such as cluster a in ngc  1569 , the west nuclear region in ngc  3556 , and the northern knot in ngc  5676 , we will treat the underlying continuum as though it originates from an evolved stellar population of solar metallicity for simplicity , even though this may not be entirely accurate .",
    "table  [ t_youngoldrat ] lists the masses of young and old stars within the non - quiescent systems and the ratio of the masses as well as all of the parameters needed to calculate the masses .",
    "note that the luminosities and masses in table  [ t_youngoldrat ] are for the region that falls within the spectrometers slits and may not necessarily reflect the true total luminosities and masses for the nuclear star forming regions if the regions are extended .",
    "the results demonstrate that a strong star formation event could produce up to 5  % of the stellar mass found within a galaxy s nucleus .",
    "the data also demonstrate that we were able to detect star formation within galaxies where the young stars accounted for less than 0.03  % of the total mass , but typically young stars make up @xmath02  % of the nuclear stellar mass in a non - quiescent galaxy .",
    "the young stars also contribute appreciably to the k - band luminosities of these galaxies nuclei . in some cases , the young stars contribute more than 10  % of the flux in the k - band .    these ratios of young to old stellar mass agree with an overall picutre of nuclear stellar populations being formed in a series of instantaneous bursts .",
    "consider that 20  % of the galaxies in this sample have recently increased their central masses by 2  % .",
    "these young stellar masses formed within the past 36  myr .",
    "this means that the mass of the average galaxy s nuclear population increases by @xmath00.4  % over a period of 36  myr .",
    "the age of the universe is @xmath014  gyr .",
    "therefore , if the nuclear stellar masses are being increased continuously over time , then 36  myr  /  14  gyr of the mass , or 0.25  % , of the stellar mass should have been created within the past 36  myr in the average galaxy . despite the number of approximations in this calculation ,",
    "these two percentages are consistent with each other , which supports the paradigm of nuclear star formation occurring as instantaneous bursts spread over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "the data also place the northern knot of ngc  5676 into an interesting context .",
    "the mass of stars being formed within the northern knot and the percentage of mass in new stars is comperable to those values for nuclear bursts of star formation .",
    "although nuclear star formation is very important in nearby galaxies , this star formation event in ngc  5676 highlights the importance of not ignoring the role of extranuclear bursts of star formation in galactic evolution .    as a more technical achievement ,",
    "the analysis for both the brackett-@xmath1 and fe  ii lines produce similar results in the two galaxies in this analysis . for ngc  289 ,",
    "the two young stellar masses calculated from the two lines are within a factor of 3 of each other . for ngc  5713 , however , the results agree to within 20  % .",
    "this demonstrates that our methods for calculating young stellar masses are at least internally consistent .",
    "however , it is quite a spectacular achievement , especially given some of the order of magnitude uncertainties in the interpretation of the starburst99 data .",
    "in paper 2 , we justified using mid- and far - infrared fluxes divided by near - infrared fluxes as a tracer of star formation activity by examining the ratios that were predicted by starburst99 . as a test of these tracers , we will compare the colors and luminosities of the quiescent and non - quiescent galaxies to each other .",
    "figure  [ f_collum ] shows a plot of the @xmath34 colors for the inner 15of the galaxies in the spectroscopic subsample against both the mid - infrared and the k - band luminosities from the same regions .",
    "galaxies with quiescent and non - quiescent nuclear spectra are represented as different symbols on the plots .",
    "the detection of spectral line emission is not correlated with luminosity in either waveband . however , when the non - quiescent systems with only shock emission lines are excluded , it appears that ratios like the @xmath34 ratio are well correlated with the detection of recombination lines in the near - infrared , although the correlation is not perfect . when the k - s test is applied in comparing the quiescent versus non - quiescent @xmath34 ratios ,",
    "the resulting fractional probability that the two data sets came from the same samples is 0.026 .",
    "however , when the galaxies producing only shock excitation line emission are left out of the non - quiescent sample , the k - s test determines the probability as 0.0032 . this is a strong statistical demonstration that shows the relation between systems producing strong brackett-@xmath1 emission and systems with high @xmath34 ratios .",
    "three of the non - quiescent galaxies , however , occupy locations in these color - magnitude diagrams where their colors are close to the mean value but where their luminosities are relatively high compared to galaxies with similar colors .",
    "all three of these galaxies have strong shock excitation line emission , which could imply that supernovae are present .",
    "now , consider figure  2 in paper  2 . for an instantaneous burst , any tracer of the bolometric luminosity ( such as the 12  @xmath2 m emission , which is discussed in paper 2 ) when normalized by the k - band emission will drop sharply when massive main sequence objects evolve into red supergiants .",
    "the low colors are found at @xmath08  myr , when supernova activity is also strong .",
    "therefore , supernovae could be responsible for producing the observed shock emission lines in these systems as well as reduced @xmath34 ratios and the relatively high luminosities observed in these galaxies .    in summary , the @xmath34 ratio appears to be well correlated with strong photoionization emission in the near - infrared , although it is not correlated with strong shock excitation emission .",
    "therefore , mir - infrared fluxes , as well as the correlated far - infrared fluxes , can be used to trace star formation activity when normalized by k - band fluxes .",
    "in this sample , 33 of the 41 galaxies nuclei were found to have quiescent spectra .",
    "these spectra consisted of continuum emission with many metal and co absorption lines , which are characteristic of evolved red stars . using starburst99 , we found that the composite spectrum made from these quiescent galaxies spectra was best represented by an instantaneous burst that took place @xmath0180  myr ago , although we caution that this is not necessarily supposed to reflect the true star formation history .",
    "we found few differences between using salpeter and other imfs , but we did find that the continuous star formation scenario failed to reproduce the observed equivalent widths .",
    "the remaining 8 galaxies have nuclear spectra that include emission lines . in many cases ,",
    "the underlying continuum exhibited the same slope and contained the same absorption features that were present in the composite quiescent spectra .",
    "on top of this quiescent continuum , the galaxy may produce either photoionization lines such as brackett-@xmath1 and he  i emission , shock excitation lines such as h@xmath14 lines and fe  ii emission , or both .",
    "the lines present would reflect the age of the young stellar population , with photoionization lines present up to 8  myr after a burst and shock excitation lines present from 3.5 to 36  myr after a burst .",
    "some of the systems showed relatively point - like spectral line emission , whereas others exhibited emission in complex structures .",
    "one galaxy , where the nuclear emission was quiescent , had a strong extranuclear starburst that was detected and included in some parts of the analysis .",
    "these non - quiescent galaxies share many characteristics .",
    "all of them are sbc galaxies or later , which suggests that these instantaneous nuclear bursts are more likely in the later - type galaxies .",
    "6 of the 8 galaxies were definitely barred , which suggested that bars may play a role in triggering nuclear star formation .",
    "however , 6 of the 8 galaxies either were interacting or had been involved in interactions , which suggests that interactions are just as important as bars in triggering nuclear star formation . in relation to agn activity , it appears that most non - quiescent galaxies are h  ii galaxies and that most liners and transition objects are quiescent .",
    "the average ratio of young to old stellar masses for the non - quiescent systems was found to be @xmath02  % . given that these 2  % enhancements occur in @xmath020  % of the galaxies in the sample , these enhancements are found to be consistent with nuclear stellar populations forming through a series of instantaneous bursts .",
    "finally , we found that the @xmath34 ratios functioned very well in separating non - quiescent galaxies from quiescent galaxies .",
    "the exception was with galaxies that contained only shock excitation lines , but the ratio was expected to decrease signficantly for these galaxies .",
    "the data and results presented here now form a baseline for comparison to other galaxies with more exotic star formation or agn activity . furthermore , the composite quiescent spectra and the conversion factors developed here should provide additional analysis tools for studying enhanced star formation activity .",
    "while the spectroscopy presented here surveys a range of different kinds of galaxies , it is only a limited sample .",
    "a broad range of morphologies were included in the sample , but not a broad range of agn types ; the spectroscopic sample only contained two seyferts .",
    "furthermore , as virgo cluster galaxies were left out of the original sample , no data are available for comparing field and cluster galaxies",
    ". a larger near - infrared spectroscopic survey of a complete , volume - limited sample of galaxies would provide additional constraints on these stochastic bursts of star formation , such as the frequency of their occurence , their relation to bars , environment , seyfert activity , and liner activity , and the range of masses formed within these bursts .",
    "single slit spectrometers are good for sampling the pointlike nuclei of many nearby galaxies and can return spectroscopic data that accurately represent the stellar populations and total star formation activity within these galaxies .",
    "however , when the nuclear star formation structures become more complex , as is the case for ngc  3556 and ngc  4100 , then a single slit could possibly miss much of the spectral line emission coming from within the centers of these galaxies .",
    "therefore , integral field near - infrared spectroscopic surveys of nearby spiral galaxies would appear to be warranted .",
    "such a survey would not only provide more accurate data on the stellar populations and total line emission from the nuclei of galaxies but also provide data on the number of galaxies with complex , extended nuclear structures that could lead to additional clues on the phenomenology of nuclear star formation activity .",

    "<S> the signatures of recent star formation activity are only found in 20% of the subsample , even though older red stars still dominate the stellar populations in these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> given the dominance of evolved stars in most galaxy nuclei and the nature of the emission lines in the galaxies where they were detected , we suggest that nuclear star formation proceeds in the form of instantaneous bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the stars produced by these bursts comprise only @xmath02 % of the total nuclear stellar mass in these galaxies , but we demonstrate how the nuclear stellar populations of normal spiral galaxies can be built up through a series of these bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the bursts were detected only in sbc galaxies and later , and both bars and interactions appeared to be sufficient but not necessary triggers for the nuclear star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of galaxies with nuclear star formation were classified as hii galaxies . with one exception , </S>",
    "<S> liners and transition objects were dominated by older red stars , which suggested that star formation was not responsible for generating these galaxies optical line emission . </S>"
