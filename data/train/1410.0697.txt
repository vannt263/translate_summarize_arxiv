    "these new magnetic bragg reflections are significantly weaker ( on the order of a factor of 50 ) than those at the primary magnetic propagation vector ( 0  0  @xmath3 ) and are not clearly observed in the scans along the [ 0  0  @xmath35 ] direction [ see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](f ) ] .    to further investigate the nature of the magnetic structure associated with these new magnetic diffraction peaks , scans were performed along the [ 0  @xmath34  0 ] ( [ @xmath36  0  0]@xmath33 ) direction at the position of the ( 0  1  0 ) [ ( 1  0  0)@xmath33 ] magnetic bragg peaks both with and without one of the pg filters .",

    "we assign the new half - integer and integer magnetic peaks to a second magnetically ordered state that coexists with the ( 0  0  @xmath3 ) magnetic state .",

    "furthermore , based on the measurements described above , the moment associated with this new magnetic ordering lies along the orthorhombic _ * b*_-axis , perpendicular to the ordered moment determined for the bragg peaks associated with the ( 0  0  @xmath3 ) magnetic propagation vector .",
    "however , an unambiguous determination of this new magnetic structure below 4  k will require a full refinement of @xmath45 to determine why the half - integer and integer magnetic magnetic bragg peaks are absent or very weak in the [ 0  0  @xmath35 ] scan below 1.9  k [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](f ) ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , previous physical property measurements indicate the onset of fm order below 4  k in these samples [ see fig .",

    "finally , scans along the diagonal directions in the ( @xmath36  @xmath34  0 ) reciprocal lattice plane were performed to check for any reflections , indicative of long - range ordering of vacancies on the ge sites ( e.g. the @xmath18ge@xmath19 structure ) , at positions related to the ( 1/2  1/2  0 ) and ( 1/4  -1/4  0 ) chemical superlattice reflections described by zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite for other @xmath11ge@xmath7 compounds .",
    "no evidence of these superlattice peaks with an intensity in excess of 0.1% of the strongest allowed nuclear reflections was found , consistent with previous studies of the cege@xmath7 system.@xcite however , we can not exclude that short - range vacancy ordering may play some role in promoting the presence of the second afm ordered state found in our measurements .",
    "regardless , we note that the afm order reported here is related to propagation vectors along the orthorhombic * _ c_*-axis , whereas the reported chemical superstructures are related to propagation vectors of the chemical unit cell in the * _ ab _ * plane .",
    "we have performed neutron diffraction measurements on solution - grown single crystals of cege@xmath0 between 300  k and 1.7  k to determine the nature of the magnetic ordering at low temperature .",
