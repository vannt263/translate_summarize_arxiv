    "<S> using density matrix renormalization group techniques , we have studied the ground state of the 4-leg @xmath0-@xmath1  ladder doped near half - filling . depending upon @xmath2 and the hole doping @xmath3 , three types of ground state phases are found : ( 1 ) a phase containing @xmath4 pairs ; ( 2 ) a striped cdw domain - wall phase , and ( 3 ) a phase separated regime . </S>",

    "<S> we find three types of ground state phases : ( 1 ) a pair - gas phase containing @xmath4   pairs ; ( 2 ) a striped cdw domain wall phase , where each domain wall consists of four holes ; and ( 3 ) a phase separated regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the @xmath0-@xmath1  model is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are electron creation and spin operators respectively , @xmath14 is the occupation number operator , @xmath15 is the gutzwiller projection operator which excludes configurations with doubly occupied sites , and @xmath16 denotes nearest neighbor sites . here we report results for ladders with open boundary conditions for hole dopings of @xmath17 and various @xmath2 values . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations for the 4-leg ladders were carried out using a dmrg method in which transformation matrices were stored and used to construct the initial state for each superblock diagonalization@xcite . of order @xmath18 states </S>",
    "<S> were kept per block , and the final transformation matrices were used to calculate the ground state expectation values of the desired operators at the end of the calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the types of ground state phases which we have found are illustrated in fig .  1 . the results shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> 1 are for a @xmath19 lattice with from 8 to 16 holes . </S>",
    "<S> these figures represent the most probable configuration of holes in the system , obtained by maximizing the ground state expectation value of a hole projection operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hole projection operator for the @xmath22 lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in fig .  1 were obtained by maximizing @xmath23 over @xmath24 , then maximizing @xmath25 over @xmath26 with fixed @xmath24 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , until all the holes have been located . </S>",
    "<S> although this procedure is not guaranteed to give the maximum of @xmath27 over all @xmath28 , we have not observed any cases in which it appears to fail . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the holes are shown as the solid circles in fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> these pictures of most - likely hole configurations are representative of the three phases we have found for dopings @xmath29 , with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) shows a gas of pairs , which occurs at low doping levels for a wide range of @xmath2 , in this case @xmath31 , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> domain - wall phases occur at somewhat higher doping levels , also for a wide range of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows a domain - wall phase for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where the most probable hole configuration has holes along a diagonal . for smaller values of @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the most probable hole configuration consists of a zig - zag pattern along the two center chains , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) for @xmath34 , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to the domain walls of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and 1(c ) as `` transverse '' ( 1,1 ) and `` longitudinal '' domain walls , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) , where the holes have all moved to either end of the ladder , occurs for @xmath2 greater than about 1.5 - 1.9 , in this case @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation first manifests as an attraction between domain walls , and as an attraction between the ends of the ladder and the walls , as shown in the figure . for @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> the holes become closely packed at the ends of the ladder@xcite .    in order to obtain a clearer picture of the nature of the pair - gas and domain - wall phases , </S>",
    "<S> we have examined various local correlations . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(a ) shows the probability of various hole configurations near the most likely configuration for the system shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diameter of the dots is proportional to the probability of the last hole being on that site , when all the other hole positions are fixed . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the left - hand hole of the second pair from the left is allowed to vary . </S>",
    "<S> although the maximum point shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) has this pair as nearest neighbors , the probability of the last hole being on either the site above or below the maximum point is nearly as large . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with lanczos calculations for two holes on a periodic @xmath38 lattice , in which for @xmath32 the holes are about 20@xmath39% more likely to be found across a diagonal than on near - neighbor sites@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(b ) shows the expectation value of the kinetic energy on each bond when the location of all but one of the holes [ the same hole as in ( a ) ] has been specified by the projection operator .    the expectation value of @xmath40 near the paired holes in the two most likely configurations of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) and ( d ) . in these plots , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the lines is proportional to the bond strength @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to showing the nearest - neighbor correlations , we show next - nearest neighbor correlations when both sites are adjacent to the same hole , but only when these correlations are antiferromagnetic , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> antiferromagnetic correlations coupling next - nearest neighbor sites across dynamic holes is an almost universal feature of the doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model@xcite , and presumably other doped antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> these frustrating correlations develop in order to minimize the kinetic energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strong diagonal singlet correlation crossing the hole pair in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) is a striking example of this effect . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy term strongly favors a singlet bond connecting these sites since for four of the eight hops available to the holes in this configuration , this bond becomes a nearest - neighbor exchange bond . </S>",
    "<S> this diagonal singlet is characteristic of a @xmath4 pair@xcite .    a closer view of the domain walls in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and ( c ) is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of finding at a given site the fourth hole making up a transverse domain wall is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that while the ( 1,1 ) direction is favored , the domain wall is fluctuating strongly . at larger values of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> ( e.g. @xmath43 ) the ( 0,1 ) direction becomes favored . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of the exchange field @xmath40 for this wall is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a number of its features are similar to those of the hole pair in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) . in this case , instead of one diagonal singlet bond </S>",
    "<S> , three bonds are apparent . </S>",
    "<S> these diagonal singlets allow the wall to fluctuate strongly , reducing the kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> holes bind in pairs in order to share frustrating bonds@xcite . in a pair , however , there is still frustration present , since the diagonal singlet represents antiferromagnetic correlations between sites on the same sublattice . in a transverse domain wall , </S>",
    "<S> however , the undoped spin background is broken into two unconnected parts by the wall , eliminating the frustration . </S>",
    "<S> application of a staggered magnetic field to one end of the system ( not shown ) shows that the domain walls separate @xmath44-phase shifted regions with short - range antiferromagnetic spin correlations . however , the kinetic energy of the wall is not as low as that of two isolated pairs , making the walls unstable at low hole densities for moderate values of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy favors hole configurations that 1 ) avoid the edge sites , since the open boundary conditions act like hard walls , and 2 ) avoid nearest - neighbor hole positions , since the holes act like hard - core objects . </S>",
    "<S> however , these types of hole configurations are generally not favored by the exchange energy , leading to competition . at </S>",
    "<S> weak to moderate @xmath2 values , the ( @xmath45,1 ) directions are favored for the domain wall largely because these hole configurations avoid nearest - neighbor hole configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of this competition is seen in the most probable location of a pair in the pair - gas phase . for @xmath33 , </S>",
    "<S> pairs are found primarily on outer chains in order to form undoped two - leg ladder structures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an undoped 2-leg ladder has a spin gap of order 0.5@xmath46 , which is associated with both a rise in the spin excitations and a lowering of the `` vacuum '' ground - state energy of the 2-leg ladder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus an undoped 2-leg ladder is a low - energy configuration . for @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> the tendency of the holes to avoid the edge sites is slightly stronger , and pairs are more likely to be found on the two middle chains , as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) and 2(a ) .    for smaller values of @xmath2 , this tendency of the holes to avoid the edge sites affects the structure of a domain wall , and a longitudinal domain wall becomes more likely than a transverse domain wall . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) we show the exchange field near a longitudinal domain wall . again </S>",
    "<S> , diagonal singlet correlations are present . in this case </S>",
    "<S> singlets are frustrating only near the ends of the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have characterized the phases of the @xmath0-@xmath1  model using the most probable hole configurations for typical systems . however , representing a system by a single hole configuration suggests that the holes are nearly static , which for small or moderate values of @xmath2 is very far from the truth . </S>",
    "<S> although with dmrg we can calculate @xmath47 for any given configuration , the space of configurations is too large to study or portray directly . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative representation of the system can be obtained by generating a set of configurations chosen randomly from the probability distribution @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> ( since @xmath49 is a projection operator , @xmath48 is nonnegative . ) to generate these `` typical '' configurations , we have used a simple classical monte carlo algorithm to wander randomly through hole configuration space according to the probability distribution @xmath48 , which is calculated using dmrg . </S>",
    "<S> this monte carlo calculation is done after the dmrg sweeps have finished , and after we have found the most probable hole configuration , which is used as the starting point of the monte carlo . at each monte carlo step , a hole is chosen at random , as well as one of the four directions @xmath50 , @xmath51 . if the move of that hole one step in the chosen direction is not possible ( e.g. a hop onto a neighboring hole ) , the step is rejected . </S>",
    "<S> if the step is possible , it is accepted with metropolis probability @xmath52 , where the dmrg transformation matrices are used to calculate @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is fast enough to allow several hundred monte carlo sweeps , which is enough to get a number of typical configurations .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) we show 12 typical configurations for a @xmath54 system with 8 holes and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the first configuration in the upper left is the initial , most probable one , showing two transverse domain walls . moving downward , </S>",
    "<S> successive configurations are separated by 240 monte carlo steps , enough to make them nearly uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in most of the configurations , there are no recognizable domain walls . from these configurations </S>",
    "<S> ( and others not shown ) the holes appear to make up a strongly correlated gas , made up of clusters of two , four , and sometimes three holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is not obvious from the figure that the wavefunction represented by these configurations should exhibit the charge density wave ( cdw ) structure expected from a set of domain walls .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) we show the total average hole density per rung @xmath55 for the system shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that a strong cdw density variation is present , as one would expect from the maximum probability domain - wall pictures : the domain walls take up four rungs , and are separated by two rungs , which form a low - energy undoped two - leg ladder . </S>",
    "<S> these cdw domain - wall structures are subtle correlations built into the ground state wavefunction , and are difficult to see in a limited number of hole - configuration snapshots , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the density variations are usually commensurate with the lattice , with pronounced two - rung low - doping regions separating hole - rich domain - wall regions . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice sizes and dopings shown have been chosen to match and enhance these commensurate density variations . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear from the results we have so far whether there is commensurate long - range cdw order at special fillings ( such as @xmath56 ) , or simply power - law decay of cdw correlations . also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) are results for a @xmath57 system with @xmath32 and 6 holes , showing cdw correlations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there are three separate pairs which give rise to these `` @xmath58 '' cdw correlations , as opposed to the two - pair ( 4 hole ) domain - wall structures of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior in the pair - gas phase is similar to the pairing - cdw correlations observed in 2-chain ladders@xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) we show results for the equal - time @xmath4   pair - field correlation function , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 destroys a nearest - neighbor @xmath4   pair at site @xmath61@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows @xmath62 as a function of doping @xmath3 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 chosen symmetrically about the center of the lattice , and with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is useful as a measure of the overall strength of the pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing correlations for @xmath33 initially rise with doping , reaching a maximum between @xmath34 and @xmath66 , and then decrease . </S>",
    "<S> extended @xmath67-wave pairing correlations ( not shown ) are much smaller in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath33 the magnitude of the correlations near the maximum is similar to that seen in a two - leg hubbard ladder with @xmath68 ( corresponding to @xmath69)@xcite . for @xmath32 the peak </S>",
    "<S> is reduced in magnitude and occurs at somewhat reduced doping . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath70 the correlations ( not shown ) are less than @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath72 versus @xmath73 near the maximum ( not shown ) is consistent with a power law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown bear a strong resemblence to a plot of @xmath74 versus @xmath3 for a typical cuprate superconductor@xcite . remarkably , the pairing correlations are larger in the domain - wall phase than in the pair - gas phase </S>",
    "<S> . the domain - wall phase appears to exhibit `` supersolid '' behavior , with simultaneous pairing and cdw correlations . from the hole - configuration snapshots , </S>",
    "<S> we see how this can happen : the domain walls appear as an unbound resonance of hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> there are also weaker resonances involving three - hole structures . </S>",
    "<S> these resonances are not strong enough to significantly weaken the pairing , and , in fact , the increased density of pairs in the domain - wall phase leads to an increase in the pairing correlations relative to the more dilute pair - gas phase , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the domain - wall phase we have found resembles in some respects the singlet striped phase proposed by tsunetsugu , et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in addition , various hartree - fock calculations @xcite , as well as gutzwiller variational monte carlo calculations@xcite have found evidence for the formation of domain walls in the 2d hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that a cdw domain - wall phase occurs prior to phase separation was suggested by prelovsek and zotos@xcite based on studies of four - hole correlation functions on small @xmath0-@xmath1   clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our present calculations show that domain - wall cdw ground state phases can occur in 4-leg @xmath0-@xmath1   ladders . </S>",
    "<S> the domain walls should be thought of as highly - fluctuating resonances of pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these cdw domain - wall phases have significant @xmath4   pair field correlations , which are substantially stronger than in the low - doping pair - gas phase . </S>"
