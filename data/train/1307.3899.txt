    "we have computed the lyapunov exponents using the kac - rice formula . at finite kubo numbers",

    "first , as mentioned in the introduction , spatial clustering of weakly inertial particles in incompressible velocity fields is often described in terms of a model where the particles are advected in a synthetic velocity field with a small compressible component ( due to the particle inertia ) .",
    "it is known that this approach must fail when the inertia is large ( because of the formation of caustics ) .",
    "but there is also a problem in the small - inertia limit .",

    "( [ eq : st ] ) with the leading - order term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum_lambda_smallku_2d ] ) at small @xmath183 and @xmath139 would lead us to conclude that weakly inertial particles are described by an advective model with effective compressibility @xmath185 .",
    "but this does not give the correct result for @xmath2 ( c.f .",
    "( 8) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , neither does this correspondence yield consistent results for terms of higher order in @xmath0 ( determined by higher - order correlation functions of the velocity field ) .",
    "this shows that care is required when approximating the dynamics of weakly inertial particles by advection in a weakly compressible velocity field : in general the statistics obtained by sampling along particle trajectories with actual inertial velocities , and in the effective compressible velocity field are different .",
    "second , a related @xmath0-expansion was recently used to compute the tumbling rate of small axisymmetric particles in three - dimensional random velocity fields at finite kubo numbers @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the resummation works well also for the series expansion of the tumbling rate .    financial support by vetenskapsrdet and by the gran gustafsson foundation for research in natural sciences and medicine and by",
