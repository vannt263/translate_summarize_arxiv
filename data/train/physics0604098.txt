    "an understanding of electron collision processes with oxygen molecules is important because of its role in chemistry of electrical discharge and the upper atmosphere . in recent attempts to an operate electrical discharge oxygen - iodine laser ,",
    "a population inversion of iodine atoms was achieved by a near resonant energy transfer via the @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 process .",
    "in contrast to the traditional liquid chemistry singlet oxygen generator @xcite , recent studies @xcite utilize flowing electric discharges where electron collisions with o@xmath0 excited electronic states can be important @xcite . in such conditions ,",
    "even highly excited metastable states of o@xmath0(@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) may play roles @xcite , in addition to the lower o@xmath0 @xmath2 and @xmath3 excited states .",
    "however , most previous work has concentrated on electron collisions with the o@xmath13 ground state , so our knowledge of electron impact transitions from the o@xmath14 and @xmath3 excited states is limited . the past experimental and theoretical works concerning electron o@xmath0(@xmath15 , @xmath2 ) collisions were summarized by brunger and buckman @xcite .",
    "one work on the excited electronic states is measurement of differential and integral cross sections at 4.5 ev for excitation from the o@xmath0 @xmath2 state to the @xmath3 state by hall and trajmar @xcite .",
    "their value is more than an order of magnitude larger than that for the @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath3 cross section .",
    "also , khakoo et al .",
    "@xcite studied the energy - loss spectrum for electron impact excitation on discharged o@xmath0 and assigned the transitions o@xmath0 @xmath2 ( @xmath17=0 ) @xmath16 o@xmath0 @xmath18 ( @xmath19=0,1, .. 7 ) .",
    "burrow @xcite and beli and hall @xcite studied dissociative electron attachment with the o@xmath0 @xmath2 state .",
    "the later authors found that dissociation proceeds to 3 different limits , o@xmath20+o@xmath21 , o@xmath20+o@xmath22 and o@xmath20+o@xmath23 .",
    "in contrast to the situation in electron collisions with the excited oxygen molecule , a lot of work has been performed on the ground state o@xmath0 , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite .",
    "notably , noble , burke and their co - workers extensively applied their r - matrix method to the electron o@xmath0 collision problems during 1992 - 1996 @xcite .",
    "they studied electronic excitation processes from the o@xmath13 ground state to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 states using the fix - bond r - matrix method @xcite and applied the non - adiabatic r - matrix method to vibrational excitations process of the @xmath24 @xmath16 @xmath25 transitions @xcite .",
    "they also calculated differential cross sections for elastic electron collisions of the @xmath15 state @xcite as well as impact excitations from the @xmath15 state to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states @xcite .",
    "the effect of nuclear motion was included in the former elastic cross sections by vibrational averaging of the t - matrix @xcite .",
    "other than these r - matrix calculations , teillet - billy et al .",
    "@xcite applied effective range theory ( ert ) to excitations from the @xmath15 to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states . because of the different treatment of the o@xmath26 resonances , the ert results deviate from the r - matrix cross sections at energies above 5 ev .",
    "given the importance of electron collisions with excited o@xmath0 molecules , we perform r - matrix calculations for electron o@xmath0(@xmath2,@xmath3 ) collisions . we chose the r - matrix method because it has been successfully applied to many electron - molecule collisions including e - n@xmath0 , n@xmath0o and h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "the fixed - bond method was employed in this work , because it gave reasonably good results in previous studies @xcite for transitions from the o@xmath0 @xmath15 state to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 state , and the ` 6 ev states ' ( @xmath10+@xmath11+@xmath12 ) .",
    "in addition to these 6 low lying o@xmath0 target states , previous calculations included three higher excited target states of o@xmath0 @xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath29 , in order to improve quality of the r - matrix calculations @xcite . in this work",
    ", we use a valence complete active space description of the o@xmath0 target states and add other valence target states , @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32,@xmath33 , in our calculations . since excitation energies of some of these states are lower than those of @xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath29 states , some improvement can be expected by inclusion of these extra @xmath34 target states . in principle , a complete valence active space is not sufficient for the description of these targets , because some of them are mixed with n=3 rydberg states as described in buenker and peyerimhoff @xcite .",
    "since expansion of this active space increases the calculation cost considerably , we limit ourselves here the inclusion of the valence states to test the effects of the higher excited states .    in this paper , details of the calculations are presented in section 2 , and we discuss the results in section 3 comparing our results with previous theoretical and available experiments . then the summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the r - matrix method has been described extensively in the previous literature @xcite , so here we only repeat the outline of the method . in this method ,",

    "the target wave functions are contained in the sphere @xmath37 , whereas the diffuse functions overlap the boundary at @xmath39 in order to describe the scattering electron . in the outer region @xmath40",
    ", the problem is reduced to single electron scattering , ignoring exchange of the scattering electron with the target electrons .",
    "interaction of the scattering electron and the target is considered through static multipolar interaction terms which introduce inter - channel couplings .",
    "the wave functions obtained in the inner region are converted to the r - matrix at the boundary @xmath35=@xmath41 , then the coupled radial schrdinger equations are solved so as to extract scattering information at the asymptotic region .    in the inner region , the @xmath36",
    "+ 1 electronic wavefunctions are expanded as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an antisymmetrization operator , @xmath44 are the @xmath36 electron target ci wave functions , @xmath45 are the diffuse functions representing wave functions of a scattering electron , and @xmath46 are bound @xmath36 + 1 electron wave functions , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are variational coefficients . in this expression ,",
    "the first term represents the scattering of an electron from and to the asymptotic region .",
    "the second summation involves purely @xmath49 integrable terms .",
    "in addition to the target molecular orbitals included in the ci wavefunctions in the first summation , some extra target virtual orbitals are usually included in @xmath46 in order to account for short range polarization effects .",
    "we used a modified version of the polyatomic programs in the uk molecular r - matrix codes @xcite .",
    "these programs utilize gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) to represent target molecule as well as a scattering electron . although most of past r - matrix works on electron o@xmath0 collisions had employed the diatomic modules using slater type orbitals ( sto ) obtained by hartree fock(hf ) calculation , we select gto mainly because of simplicity of the input and availability of basis functions .",
    "the state averaged complete active space scf ( sa - casscf ) orbitals are imported from the target calculations with molpro suites of programs @xcite .",
    "this employment of sa - casscf orbitals improves the vertical excitation energies of the o@xmath0 target states compared to the energies obtained using hf orbitals .",
    "these target orbitals are constructed from the [ 5s,3p ] contracted basis of dunning @xcite augmented by a d function with exponent 1.8846 , as in sarpal et al .",
    "@xcite . in the r - matrix calculations",
    ", we included 13 target states ; @xmath15,@xmath2 , @xmath50,@xmath10,@xmath11 , @xmath12,@xmath27,@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the last 4 @xmath34 states were not included in previous calculations .",

    ", the number of configurations generated for a specific total symmetry is typically about 17000 , though the final dimension of the inner region hamiltonian is reduced to be about 500 by using ci target contraction and prototype ci expansion method @xcite .    in order to obtain the integral cross sections for the electron o@xmath0 collisions",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the potential energy curves of the o@xmath0 target states .",
    "these curves were calculated by the sa - casscf method which was used in the actual r - matrix calculations .",
    "although not included in our r - matrix calculations , we also include the curves for the o@xmath74 states for reference .",
    "table [ tab1 ] compares vertical excitation energies from the present calculations with previous hf / sto results .",
    "compared to the experimentally estimated values , our results are of the same quality for the o@xmath0 @xmath2 state and are slightly worse , 0.05 ev , than the hf / sto result for the @xmath50 state .",
    "however , the excitation energies are improved by about 0.1 ev for the ` 6 ev states ' ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for the higher 3 electronic states ,",
    "the improvement is about 1 ev . though discrepancies with the experimental values are still not small , 0.22 ev for the @xmath50 state and 0.45 ev for the @xmath11 state for examples , we believe that our choice of the gto basis set and the cas space is satisfactory for the present r - matrix calculations considering the differences with the previous hf / sto results .    in figures",
    "[ fig2]-[fig5 ] , the cross sections for the transitions from the o@xmath0(@xmath15 ) ground state are shown .",
    "these cross sections were previously calculated using the r - matrix method , but with a different basis set and target descriptions @xcite . in figure [ fig2 ] , we compare our elastic scattering cross sections for the @xmath15 state with the previous theoretical and experimental results .",
    "the theoretical elastic scattering cross sections are quite similar in shape and magnitude each other .",
    "there is a sharp peak around 0.5 ev in each theoretical cross section , which comes from the o@xmath26 @xmath75 resonance . in our calculation with 13 target states including 4 extra @xmath34 targets ,",
    "this @xmath75 resonance is located at 0.196 ev and the width is 0.00134 ev . when the number of targets are reduced to 9 by removing the @xmath34 target states ,",
    "the location of the resonance is shifted to 0.548 ev with a width of 0.0161 ev .",
    "the later resonance parameters with 9 target states are closer to the results of the previous calculations , reflecting inclusion of the same number of the target states .",
    "when our results are compared to the experimentally measured elastic cross sections , agreement is good for energy above 10 ev but is poorer at lower scattering energy below 5 ev . at 1 ev , the theoretical cross section is about a factor of 2 larger than the experimental results .",
    "this situation mirrors that in the previous r - matrix calculations . as discussed in noble and burke @xcite ,",
    "this discrepancy is attributed to lack of long - range polarization effects in our and their model . to improve this low energy behaviour of the elastic cross sections",

    "@xcite and gorfinkiel and tennyson @xcite for example .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show excitation cross sections from the o@xmath0 @xmath15 state to the @xmath2 and @xmath50 states . in both figures",
    ", there is a pronounced peak in the cross sections around 8 ev which comes from the o@xmath26 @xmath76 resonance located at 7.988 ev with its width being 0.906 ev . compared to the previous r - matrix calculations of noble and burke @xcite , our cross sections with 13 target states are slightly smaller at all scattering energies .",
    "the peak height of our results around 8 ev is 30% smaller in excitation to the @xmath2 case and is 35% smaller in the @xmath50 case .",

    "we also compare our results with the effective range theory ( ert ) results of teillet - billy et al",
    "their method relied on the existence of the o@xmath26 @xmath75 resonance around 0.2 ev , but did not include the effect of the o@xmath26 @xmath77 resonance located at 8 ev .",
    "thus , their results and our cross sections agree well at low energy , below 6 ev , where the @xmath75 symmetry mainly contributes to the total cross sections",
    ". however , the agreement is worse at energy range above 7 ev because of the @xmath77 resonance contributions . in both o@xmath0(@xmath2 ) and o@xmath0(@xmath50 ) cases , agreement with the experimental cross sections is modestly good in the energy regions away from the resonance peak . as shown in the figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the cross sections of middleton et al .",

    "our results are quite similar in shape and magnitude to the previous r - matrix calculation of noble and burke @xcite , though the cross section peak at 8 ev is slightly lower in our case .",
    "the ert results of gauyacq et al .",
    "@xcite are also shown in the figure . as discussed above",
    ", their cross sections do not have a peak around 8 ev because they did not include the o@xmath26 @xmath77 resonance effects .",
    "recently , green et al.@xcite measured the integral cross sections from the @xmath15 state to the ` 6 ev states ' and discussed the discrepancy between the past theoretical results and their measurements .",
    "though the theoretical cross sections have a peak around 8 ev , the experimental results do not show this peak nor the enhancement of the cross sections near 8 ev .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] compares our results with the experimental cross sections , which shows that the discrepancy still exists below 10 ev .",
    "this deviation may come from our use of fixed - bond approximation , because the equilibrium bond distances of ` 6 ev state ' are longer than those of @xmath15 , @xmath2 and @xmath50 states . in principle , we need to employ the non - adiabatic r - matrix method or vibrational averaging procedure to take into account those difference of the equilibrium distances . in this study",
    ", we limit ourselves at the fixed - bond approximation and leave the treatment of nuclear motion for work in future .    figure [ fig6 ] shows elastic cross sections for the @xmath2 state as functions of electron collision energy .",
    "these cross sections have almost the same shape and magnitude as the @xmath15 state elastic cross sections .",
    "we do not observe a sharp resonance peak in the @xmath2 elastic cross sections in contrast to the @xmath15 case , because the o@xmath26 @xmath75 resonance is located 0.7 ev below the o@xmath0 @xmath2 state , but 0.2 ev above the o@xmath0 @xmath15 state .",
    "as shown in the figure [ fig6 ] , the @xmath78 symmetry is the main contributor to the cross sections at low energy .",

    ", there is a large peak in the cross sections arising from the @xmath79 symmetry .",
    "the origin of this peak is the o@xmath26 @xmath77 resonance as in the cross sections from the @xmath15 state shown in figures [ fig3]-[fig5 ] . because the cross sections are plotted as functions of electron collision energy , the positions of the peak in figure [ fig7 ] and figure [ fig3]-[fig5 ] are different by 0.93 ev which is the energy difference of the o@xmath0 @xmath15 state and the o@xmath0 @xmath2 state .",
