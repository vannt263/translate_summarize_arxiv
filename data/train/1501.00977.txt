    "the motivation to study bhs in asymptotically ads spacetimes is driven mostly by the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "this correspondence  @xcite provides a powerful framework within which certain strongly coupled gauge theories can be mapped to weakly coupled quantum gravitational systems in one dimension higher . within this holographic setup ,",
    "a bh is dual to a thermal state .",
    "perturbed bhs are dual to non - thermal boundary gauge theories and the approach to equilibrium in the gravitational side is translated to understanding thermalization in the boundary gauge theory side  @xcite ( see also the review  @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the behavior of perturbed bhs in asymptotically ads spacetimes is therefore a central aspect of current fundamental and practical research endeavors . in asymptotically flat spacetimes ,",
    "the response of a bh spacetime to an external perturbation can be roughly divided in three stages .",
    "the initial stage corresponds to on - light - cone propagation and is entirely related to the initial data content ; at intermediate times , after the initial pulse reaches the null circular geodesic , ringdown ensues . in this stage",
    "the perturbation decays as a series of exponentially damped sinusoids , or quasinormal modes ( qnms ) whose properties are intrinsic to the bh and do not depend on the external perturbation  @xcite ; finally , at late - times backscattering off spacetime curvature becomes important , and a power - law tail becomes visible   @xcite .",
    "it turns out that asymptotically ads spacetimes introduce novel aspects in the physics of bhs , mostly due to the absence of dissipation at infinity : the boundary is timelike and perturbations `` bounce off '' .",
    "thus , one expects the structure of the perturbation spectrum to change completely and to even find linear and nonlinear instabilities in these systems  @xcite .",
    "a further interesting aspect of the different boundary conditions is that , for small ads bhs ( i.e. , for bhs whose areal radius at the horizon is much smaller than the ads scale ) one expects imprints of asymptotically flat spacetimes in the early signal  @xcite .",
    "this result , intuitive from a time evolution picture , seems to contradict frequency - domain analysis : the mode structure of small ads bhs is completely different from that of say , asymptotically flat schwarzschild or kerr bhs .",
    "furthermore , understanding the _ linear _ regime of perturbed bhs is important as benchmarks for nonlinear evolutions , some of which have been recently reported  @xcite . surprisingly , time - domain evolutions in the background of rotating bhs in ads spacetimes are missing .",
    "this work intends to close this gap .",

    "accordingly , the three stages  prompt response followed by ringdown and a power - law tail  of linearized perturbations discussed in the introduction are seen here very clearly .",
    "in fact , at early times @xmath59 and for very small @xmath60 , the _ quantitative details _ of these stages are identical to the ones in asymptotically flat spacetime . in particular small bhs in ads excite the same ringdown modes and tails as those in kerr backgrounds .",
    "this is clearly seen for small bhs such as the ones in figs .",
    "[ fig : l10000_long]-[fig : l10000 ] . a quantitative comparison of the signal with that of asymptotically flat spacetimes is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : l10000 ] , where we compare the signal against that of a bh with the same mass but living in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "the two signals are identical up to timescales of the order of the ads radius .",
    "such results are not surprising : the qnms of asymptotically flat bhs are modes leaking from the unstable null circular geodesic  @xcite and therefore could be expected to be excited as well .",
    "perhaps the unexpected feature is that they play no role whatsoever in the spectral content of the wave operator in ads , or in other words , the qnms of asymptotically flat bhs do not show up as poles of the retarded green s function in ads ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a related phenomena in connection with bhs in astrophysical environments ) .",
    "as is well known , a frequency - domain analysis for the qnms of small bhs in ads returns extremely long - lived modes lying close to the purely real , ads normal modes @xmath61 with @xmath62 angular and radial numbers respectively  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , imprints of asymptotic flatness are present in waveforms of asymptotically ads bhs .",
    "the overall magnitude of these imprints can be varied , by appropriately tuning the initial data ( for example , it can be chosen in such a way that ringdown excitation is suppressed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for studies in frequency - domain and refs .",
    "@xcite for corresponding analysis in the time - domain ) , but is otherwise generic .",
    "this is one of the main messages of our work .",
    "because the ads radius introduces an extra length scale in the problem , the evolution is characterized by two extra stages relatively to its asymptotically flat counterpart .",
    "the first occurs on timescales large enough that ads curvature becomes important , modifying the characteristic of the `` tail '' . because the power - law tails are a large wavelength effect , they feel the impact of the ads modifications and our results suggest that these changes will eventually contribute to the settling in of the ads resonant modes .",
    "the final stage is the reflection off the boundary at @xmath63 .",
    "these two stages are apparent already in fig .",
    "[ fig : l10000_long ] , where the reflection off the boundary is visible .",
    "however , a smooth transition to the ads regime would take a large number of reflections and consequently long timescales .",
    "we therefore focus on a somewhat larger ads bh , with @xmath64 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l64m0 ] for @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : l10000 ] shows that ringdown lasts for @xmath66 ; thus , similar initial data will result in a ringdown stage similar to that of asymptotically flat bhs , as long as @xmath67 , i.e. , as long as the signal does not have time to travel back from the boundary .",
    "thus , we expect that with @xmath64 the ringdown stage will not be identical to its asymptotically flat counterpart .",
    "both these features are borne out of our results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l64m0 ] .",
    "the inset , zooming in on the evolution at early times , shows that the `` asymptotically - flat '' memory ( i.e. , ringdown characteristic of asymptotically flat bhs ) is quickly distorted ; the reason , as we explained , is that on timescales of @xmath68 the field bounced back from the boundary already .",
    "we find that the transition to the ads regime occurs after a few reflections off the boundary .",
    "notice that upon each reflection at the boundary the wave is partially absorbed by the bh , leading to a steady decrease in amplitude  . we find that both the resonant frequencies and damping times are well approximated by frequency - domain results  @xcite ;",
    "in particular , for small bhs one recovers  .",
    "for example , a fourier analysis of the @xmath69 waveform yields @xmath70 , in very good agreement with numerical and analytical results in the frequency - domain , which yield @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "there are no power - law tails appearing at time scales much larger than @xmath39 because of the decay properties of the potential  @xcite .",

    "instability on the scale of @xmath73 develops in the non - axisymmetric case , as predicted by frequency - domain analysis  @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    the overall picture is the same also for non - axisymmetric modes , whose evolution is summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : l1000m]-[fig : instability ] . however , because these modes are non - axisymmetric , they are prone to superradiant effects when interacting with the bh  @xcite : for small enough rotating bhs in ads , the resonant frequency is that of pure ads , @xmath74 and can be superradiant , i.e. , @xmath75 with @xmath76 the horizon s `` angular velocity . '' in this regime , after reflection at the boundary the wave is _ amplified _ close to the horizon , leading to an exponential growth of the field .",
    "this is usually known as a bh bomb or superradiant instability  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : instability ] shows indication that the evolution of wavepackets around small , rapidly rotating bhs in ads does lead to a growth of the field .",
    "the initial stages show the same features as thhose already discussed , with the initial pulse scattering off the bh and bouncing of the ads boundary .",
    "this process will typically filter high - frequency components off the signal , because they are easily absorbed by the bh . at intermediate - late stages , the signal consists mainly on lower - frequency components which are prone to superradiance growth .",
    "we estimate the growth - timescale to be of order @xmath77 , which agrees with the estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite and with frequency - domain calculations  @xcite .",
    "the early - time evolution of fluctuations around small ads bhs is _ identical _ to that of their asymptotically flat counterpart : the evolution can be divided in the same three stages , prompt response , ringdown and late - time power - law tail .",
    "we highlight that these stages are _ not _ captured by a frequency - domain analysis  @xcite .",
    "what frequency - domain analysis does capture are the late - time dynamics , when the fluctuations have had time to bounce off the boundary several times and eventually decay in the kerr - ads quasinormal modes .",
    "these modes decay in time and can be understood as a sequence of reflections and subsequent absorption at the bh horizon . finally , we have have indications  directly in the time - domain  that small , rotating bhs in ads are unstable against a superradiant mechanism in the sense that small non - axisymmetric fluctuations grow  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in asymptotic ads spacetimes are rich but complex .",
