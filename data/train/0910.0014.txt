    "the gravitational waves ( gws ) produced during the late stages of the merger between super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , with masses of @xmath7@xmath8 , out to redshifts beyond @xmath9 , are expected to be detectable in the next decade by the _ laser interferometric space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) satellite . while the gw signatures themselves will be a rich source of information , identifying the electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart of the lisa source would open up a whole new range of scientific opportunities , from black hole astrophysics to fundamental aspects of gravitational physics and cosmology @xcite .    whether the em counterparts of the smbhbs detected by _",
    "lisa _ can be uniquely identified depends on the accuracy of localization by _",
    "lisa _ , and on the nature of the em emission .",
    "for the typical smbhb detected by _ lisa _ at @xmath10 ,",
    "the sky position and the redshift will be known to the accuracy of @xmath11 few @xmath12 0.1 square degrees , and @xmath13 few @xmath12 0.01 , respectively ( the latter limited by weak lensing errors ; e.g. @xcite ) . within this three  dimensional error volume , there will be of order @xmath14 candidate galaxies , at the optical magnitude limit expected to host such smbhbs @xcite .",
    "if the coalescing smbhs themselves produce bright emission comparable to luminous quasars , or are associated with some other , similarly rare subset comprising @xmath15 of all galaxies ( such as ultra ",
    "luminous infrared galaxies ) , then a unique counterpart may be identified among these candidates @xcite . however , having a prediction for the spectrum and the light ",
    "curve of a coalescing smbhb  and therefore knowing what characteristic signatures to look for  would make such identifications both more likely and more reliable .",
    "a promising possibility is that the coalescing smbhb produces a _ variable or transient",
    "_ em signal , which can be uncovered by suitably designed em observations , either concurrently with or following the _ lisa _ detection @xcite .",
    "the dense nuclear gas around the bh binary is expected to cool rapidly , and settle into a rotationally supported , thin circumbinary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of a smbhb embedded in such a disk has been studied in various idealized configurations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generically , at small orbital separations when the binary is detectable by _ lisa _ , the orbit decays rapidly due to gw emission .",
    "if the disk is thin , the binary torques create a central cavity , nearly devoid of gas , within a region about twice the orbital separation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "whether the decaying smbhbs produce bright emission during this stage is not well understood .",
    "if the central cavity were truly empty , no gas would reach the smbhbs , and any emission produced farther out in the disk would likely be weak .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations suggest residual gas inflow into the cavity @xcite , which may plausibly accrete onto the bhs , producing non  negligible em emission .",
    "a different possibility , and the focus of the present paper , is that variable em signatures are produced in the gas disk _ promptly after _ the coalescence of the smbhb .",
    "the burst of gws emitted during the last stages of the coalescence results in a corresponding , nearly instantaneous reduction in the binary s rest mass .",
    "furthermore , when compact objects coalesce asymmetrically , the linear momentum carried away by the gws imparts a `` kick '' to the center of mass of the system @xcite .",
    "recent break  through in numerical relativity has allowed accurate calculations of these effects , showing that the mass loss is typically several percent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , while kick velocities are typically several hundred @xmath0 , but can be as high as 4,000 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the circumbinary gas will respond promptly ( on the local orbital timescale ) to such dynamical disturbances .",
    "importantly , the gaseous disk outside the inner cavity is expected to cool efficiently and become geometrically thin , implying that the orbital motion of the gas is supersonic .",
    "this gas is therefore susceptible to prompt shocks , which could , in principle , produce a detectable transient em signature @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the motion of collisionless test particles in such a disturbed disk .",
    "as long as the particles remain bound to the central smbhb , they follow elliptical kepler orbits ( in the inertial frame of the smbhb ) .",
    "these orbits cross , and produce a characteristic , outward  propagating spiral caustic .",
    "while these results were obtained in a pressureless `` dark matter '' disk , they suggest that shocks , with a similar pattern , will indeed arise in the gas , on times  scales of @xmath16weeks to @xmath16months after the coalescence .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite and by @xcite , using n - body simulations and semi  analytical arguments , respectively , to show that a bright , post  merger `` flare '' may occur . both of these studies focused on the evolution of disks around more massive bhs on longer ( @xmath17yr ) time ",
    "scales , and proposed detecting the flare by monitoring a population of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . by comparison ,",
    "our analysis here focuses on the disks around lower ",
    "mass bhs and on the shorter time  scales of several weeks to a year , which are relevant for follow  up observations triggered by _",
    "_ detections .    motivated by the above , in the present paper , we follow up on earlier work , and compute the response of the gas disk including the effects of gas pressure using hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our main goals are ( i ) to assess shock formation in hydrodynamical disks , and ( ii ) to estimate the amount of dissipation and the resulting light ",
    "curve produced by the disk . in particular , for the latter , we will use simulations with a pseudo  isothermal equation of state .",
    "this corresponds implicitly to strong dissipation , and should represent an approximate upper limit on the disk luminosity .",
    "our computations are performed with the publicly available code flash @xcite .",
    "two other , independent studies have recently used 3dimensional simulations to address the response of gas disks to mass  loss @xcite and to both mass  loss and kicks @xcite .",
    "the main difference between our analysis and these previous works is our inclusion of runs with a pseudo  isothermal equation of state , which modifies , qualitatively , the expected em signature .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite both run simulations with an adiabatic equation of state , and find that in most cases , the gas disk typically _ dims _ following the merger .",
    "we observe a similar effect in our adiabatic runs , and attribute it to an overall dilution of the gas density .",
    "however , the gas develops significantly larger density contrasts in our pseudo  isothermal runs , and we argue that this can result in a significant _ brightening _ of the system . another important difference between our study and those of @xcite and @xcite is that we perform two  dimensional simulations , whereas @xcite and @xcite both utilized 3d simulations .",
    "while we have sacrificed resolving the vertical disk structure , this allows us to simulate a disk that extends to much larger radii ( @xmath18 schwarzschild radii ) , and follow the entire disk for a much longer period ( @xmath19 yr for a @xmath20 binary ) , in order to cover the regime relevant for follow - up observations of _ lisa _ events .",
    "given the expected size of the inner cavity in the disk , @xmath21 , studying these outer regions of the disk , and following the disk evolution on the correspondingly longer time  scale , is especially important .",
    "further differences between our study and those of @xcite and @xcite will be discussed in   [ sec : others ] below .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : problemsetup ] , we describe our computational setup , including details of the simulations , and initial conditions . in   [ sec : results ] , we present and discuss our main results .",
    "these include the impact of the kick (   [ sec : postmerger ] ) and the mass  loss ( as well as both effects in combination ; ",
    "[ sec : massloss ] ) , using constant surface density disks . in ",
    "[ sec : observational ] , we discuss our estimate of the post ",
    "merger light curves . in ",
    "[ sec : alphadisks ] , we repeat our calculations at higher resolution and with more realistic initial gas density and temperature profiles ( adapted from a standard @xmath22-disk ) . in   [ sec : numerical ] , we discuss possible numerical issues , and in   [ sec : others ] , we compare our results to previous work . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclude ] , we summarize our main conclusions and their implications , and outline natural future extensions of this study .",
    "our calculations were performed with version 2.5 of the publicly available advanced simulation and computing ( asc ) flash code , developed at the university of chicago .",
    "this code uses the split piece - wise parabolic method ( ppm ) , making it well - suited for modeling shocks @xcite .",
    "we use a uniform ",
    "mesh grid in polar coordinates to simulate a two  dimensional vertically averaged disk .",
    "our runs cover a physical duration much shorter than the viscous time  scale , and we therefore do not include any physical viscosity . the central black hole is chosen have a mass of @xmath23 , which is approximately the most favorable value for detection by _",
    "( although our results can be re  scaled to apply to bhs with different masses ; see   [ sec : numerical ] ) .",
    "the inner edge of the grid is located @xmath24 ( schwarzschild radii ) , the radius at which the central gap opened by a binary black hole is expected to freeze @xcite .",
    "a high  resolution mesh is used for radii between @xmath25 for all simulations , except the runs _ kad1 - 5 _ ( see table  [ tab : cdsims ] below ) , which use a high  resolution mesh between @xmath26 .",
    "a lower  resolution mesh extends to @xmath27 .",
    "we tested the effect of boundary conditions by simulating a disk in keplerian motion without the influence of mass loss or kick . within the 486 days",
    "we simulate after the merger , numerical fluctuations contributing to the density and luminosity of the disk were confined within the @xmath28 region .",
    "the amplitude of the numerical density perturbations was well below the over  densities produced by shocks in the disturbed disks , so in our analysis of the densities and morphologies of the shocks , we include the entire high ",
    "resolution mesh region , down to @xmath24 .",
    "however , the contribution of this low  amplitude noise to the luminosity was still significant .",
    "as a consequence , our post  processing analysis related to the disk luminosity is restricted to radii between @xmath29 ; corresponding to @xmath30 ( see discussion of this issue in   [ sec : numerical ] below ) .    in our fiducial run",
    "( see `` _ _ kiso3 _ _ '' in table  [ tab : cdsims ] below ) , the high  resolution grid contains zones with sizes @xmath31 and @xmath32 radians , which is the effective spatial resolution of this run .",
    "this run had a corresponding numerical time ",
    "resolution , in physical units , of @xmath33 seconds .",
    "however , to save disk space , flash outputs were made only at every @xmath34th time - step , allowing us to sample the results on time ",
    "scales of @xmath35 days . in physical units ,",
    "the total simulated time interval is 486 days ( or @xmath36 , in gravitational units with @xmath37 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the orbital time at the inner and outer edge of our disk is @xmath38 hours and 0.5 years , respectively , so that our simulations cover approximately 3000 and 3 full orbits at these radii . to test the numerical convergence of our results",
    ", we performed three additional variants of the fiducial run , one at lower resolution , with @xmath39 , and two at higher resolutions of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . the corresponding physical time ",
    "steps in these runs were @xmath42 and @xmath43 seconds , respectively .    it has been shown that the black hole binary can excite eccentricities in the disk within a region comparable to the binary separation @xcite .",
    "this region shrinks as the binary separation shrinks , and our region of interest ( @xmath44 ) is an order of magnitude larger than the binary separation when gravitational radiation first dominates the inspiral timescale .",
    "we therefore assume that the gas orbits have had time to circularize , and initially follow zero  eccentricity kepler orbits .",
    "the disk is assumed to consist of ideal gas , and for simplicity , we use the constant gamma - law equation of state employed by flash .",
    "we chose the value @xmath45 , corresponding to monatomic ideal gas .",
    "however , the equation of state can be calculated using one of two methods .",
    "the first method is used in simulations we call `` adiabatic , '' which use the internal energy of each mesh zone to calculate the temperature and pressure for the respective zone .",
    "the second method is `` isothermal '' for which temperature is used to calculate the internal energy and pressure for each zone .",
    "the temperature used in these calculations is held fixed throughout the disk for the duration of the simulation at a pre - specified value . in practice , this forces @xmath46 , but keeps @xmath47 constant .",
    "our adiabatic and isothermal runs should be considered limiting cases , which bracket the true behavior of a thin disk with a more realistic treatment of radiative cooling .    for simplicity , in a first set of runs , we assume the disk initially has a constant surface density ( @xmath48 ; the total mass of the disk is @xmath49 ) and a constant temperature ( chosen from the range @xmath50 ) .",
    "these choices are broadly motivated by the physical values expected in a standard @xmath22disk around a @xmath20 black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a second set of runs , we adopt radial power ",
    "law profiles for the surface density , temperature , and scale  height , given by @xmath51 the scale ",
    "height @xmath52 is not actually used in the 2d simulation , but we use it in   [ sec : others ] below to compute the 3d gas density , needed to predict the bremsstrahlung luminosity . for a standard @xmath22disk , with common choices for the viscosity parameter , disk opacity , and other parameters , the power ",
    "law slopes of the physical parameters are somewhat different in the `` inner '' ( radiation pressure and electron scattering opacity  dominated ) and `` middle '' ( gas pressure and electron scattering opacity  dominated ) regions .",
    "the transition between these two regimes occurs around @xmath53 for typical disk parameters , but the power ",
    "law slopes in these two regimes are , in any case , quite similar ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the power - law slopes we adopt in equations  ( [ eq : sigslope])-([eq : tslope ] ) are averages between the values in these two disk regions .",

    "we further use the typical value of 530 @xmath0 @xcite throughout this paper .",
    "our simulations are set up in the reference frame traveling with the kicked smbhb .",
    "since the total disk mass within our simulated region of @xmath58 is only a fraction @xmath59 of the smbhb mass , we neglect the inertia of the gas bound to the smbhb . in practice",

    "as the figure shows , sharp overdensities develop in both cases , with a morphology similar to the spiral caustics in the collisionless case @xcite .",
    "the density contrasts are visibly higher in the isothermal case , as one intuitively expects from the higher compressibility of isothermal gas .",
    "the sharpness of the thin arcs traced out by the over - dense regions suggest the presence of shocks . to assess whether shocks have indeed formed , once the simulation runs have completed , the output files were tested with an algorithm identical to the _",
    "shock_detect _ feature available in flash . to receive a shock flag ,",
    "a zone must pass both of the following criteria .",
    "first , the pressure difference between the zone and at least one of its neighbors must exceed the difference expected from the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for a shock of a pre  specified minimum mach number @xmath62 . to allow for oblique shocks ,",
    "while comparing each zone to its neighbors in different directions , the pressure is weighted according the fraction of the total velocity made up by the velocity vector in the appropriate direction .",
    "second , to avoid falsely flagging expanding regions as shocks , the velocity divergence at the zone in question must be negative .",
    "the zones identified by the above criteria shows that shocks indeed arise in our runs at early times , and propagate outward .",
    "shocks at early times in the disk were found to be typically weak .",
    "for example , in our _ kiso3 _ run , at @xmath63 days , among the shocked zones identified with the threshold @xmath64 , we find that 20% exceeded @xmath65 .",
    "subsequently , the shocks increased in strength , as they moved outward ( with the top 20% of the shocked zones having @xmath66 by @xmath67 days ) .",
    "shocks appeared in all of our runs except _ kiso6 _  in this run , the constant isothermal temperature was increased to correspond to a sound speed of @xmath68 , approximately two times larger than @xmath69 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath70 can be used as an approximate criterion for the kick to cause shocks .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation in collisionless disk , in which particles cross their epicyclic orbits with a relative velocity of @xmath71 ; in bound regions of the disk , this relative velocity is limited to @xmath72 @xcite .     and @xmath73 days after the merger ( with 4 days corresponding to the left ",
    "most point , and 300 days to the right  most point ) . ]    in figure  [ fig : densrad ] , we show the radial position of the densest point identified at several different times in the isothermal ( _ kiso1 - 6 _ ; upper panel ) and adiabatic ( _ kad1 - 5 _ ; lower panel ) runs , together with the surface density enhancement at this point , defined as @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the initial constant surface density ) . the points are shown every 4 days , between @xmath76 and @xmath73 days after the merger , with 4 days corresponding to the left  most point , and 300 days to the right  most point . in the isothermal runs the densest point in the shock wave tends to stay at the same azimuthal position in the disk , @xmath77 rad ( as measured clockwise from the y axis ) , which corresponds to the region of the disk where the kick direction is parallel to the tangential velocity of gas in the disk .",
    "the kick adds constructively to the keplerian velocity of gas at the angle @xmath78 , and it is not surprising that gas at this azimuthal position achieves the largest over - densities first .    , with the same notation ( except _ kiso6 _ is excluded , since it had no shocks ) . for comparison ,",
    "the black squares show the location of the outermost caustic identified in a collisionless disk @xcite .",
    "the straight dotted lines correspond to propagation at constant speeds of @xmath79 ( lower line ) and @xmath80 ( upper line).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in figure  [ fig : rshock ] , we show the radial position of the densest point in the disk as a function of time , in the same 10 runs as in figure  [ fig : densrad ] ( _ kiso6 _ is excluded ) . for comparison ,",
    "the black squares show the location of the outermost caustic identified in a collisionless case ( @xcite ; see further discussion in   [ sec : others ] below ) .",
    "the location of the isothermal shocks follow the caustics quite closely .",
    "however , interestingly , after @xmath81 days , the densest shock appears to propagate @xmath16 twice as rapidly in the adiabatic simulations . as figure",
    "[ fig : diskdens ] shows , the overall size and morphology of the sharp spiral patterns forming in the isothermal and adiabatic runs are quite similar , except that in the adiabatic runs , the spiral arms are more diffuse and each arm tends to extend to a somewhat larger radius than in the corresponding isothermal case .",
    "the difference in the apparent radial propagation speed of the densest point arises because typically , in the adiabatic runs ( i ) the densest point falls further out along the outermost spiral arm , and ( ii ) the outermost spiral arm extends to slightly a larger radius .",
    "furthermore , the densest point is typically farther out along the spiral pattern in adiabatic disks with increasing temperatures .",
    "interestingly , the adiabatic run with the hottest temperature ( _ kad5 _ ) is an exception ; in this run , the densest point again falls further in along the outermost spiral arm , which is noticeably more diffuse compared to the _ kad4 _ run .",
    "the spiral arms in the adiabatic runs also tended to diffuse over time , with pairs of adjacent arms eventually overlapping . in comparison , the isothermal spiral arms remained distinct and did not interact .",
    "this likely explains why the isothermal curves are much smoother than the adiabatic curves .",
    "these figures also illustrate the strength of the density perturbations caused by the kick , allowing us to draw several interesting conclusions .",
    "in particular , as the temperature , and therefore the pressure increases , the density enhancements generally decrease , as expected .",
    "the two lowest temperature cases ( @xmath82 and @xmath83k ) differ very little in either the adiabatic or isothermal case , indicating that pressure effects are negligible when the disk temperature is below @xmath84 . also as expected , the overdensities are much larger in the isothermal runs , reaching @xmath85 in our fiducial _",
    "kiso3 _ case , and still rising at the end of the run , whereas in the adiabatic run with the same temperature ( _ kad3 _ ) , the overdensity reaches a plateau and is limited to @xmath86 .",
    "pressure has little effect at very early times ( except for the extremely hot disk _ kiso6 _ ) , when the shocks are within @xmath87 and have relatively low  overdensities .",
    "note that the sound crossing time near the inner edge of the disk in our fiducial run is @xmath88 days , comparable to the time when pressure starts to have an impact on the shock overdensities .",
    "interestingly , pressure suppresses density enhancements at late times by large factors .",
    "this last conclusion is somewhat surprising , given expectations from collisionless disks ( see further discussion of this point in   [ sec : others ] below ) .",
    ", as a function of time .",
    "the different symbols correspond to the runs shown in figure  [ fig : densrad ] .",
    "the curves begin to flatten when the outermost part of the spiral pattern begins to leave the high  resolution mesh region , in both the isothermal ( @xmath89 days ) and the adiabatic simulations ( @xmath90 days ; note that in the adiabatic runs , a larger mesh was used , extending to @xmath91 ) . ]    in figure  [ fig : percentshock ] , we show the total mass of the shocked material divided by the total mass of the disk at a given time , all within the high  resolution mesh region ( @xmath92 for _ kiso1 - 5 _ , and @xmath93 for _ kad1 - 5 _ ) using the shock criteria defined above , and a minimum mach number of @xmath94 . for cold isothermal disks , a significant fraction of the disk ( @xmath2 )",
    "can be experiencing a shock at a given moment .",
    "the shocks in the adiabatic cases comprise a smaller fraction of the disk , because the temperature and pressure ( @xmath95 ) both increase in the compressed regions , reducing the bulk velocities and shock strengths .",
    "overall , compared to the isothermal cases , in the adiabatic runs the density enhancements are reduced , and shocks are weakened and are less prevalent  these trends are as expected , and follow from the lower compressibility of adiabatic gas .",
    "the results in the previous section included only the effect of the kicks , and not the effects of the accompanying mass loss .",
    "upon coalescence of the smbh binary , energy is carried away by gravitational waves , causing an instantaneous reduction of the rest mass by the amount of @xmath96 .",
    "the fractional loss depends on the mass ratio , on the orbital parameters , and on the magnitude and orientation of both bh spins , for which the full parameter space has not yet been explored in direct relativistic numerical simulations . for nearly equal mass binaries ( @xmath97 ) , however , the mass loss can be several percent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for simplicity",
    ", throughout this paper , we adopt a constant fractional mass loss of 5% .",
    "we initialize the disk with keplerian velocities for the original pre ",
    "merger point mass @xmath98 .",
    "however , in the remainder of the simulation , the gravitational potential is that of a central point mass with @xmath99 .",
    "the effects of such an instant mass - loss was treated recently by @xcite and @xcite in three ",
    "dimensional adiabatic disks . here",
    "we extend these works by following the impact of the mass - loss case in an adiabatic ( _ mad3 _ ) as well as in an isothermal disk ( _ miso3 _ ) . in the latter case",
    ", we also investigate the combined impact of mass loss and recoil ( _ mkiso3 _ ) . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "having one less dimension allows our simulations to cover the disk out to a much larger radius ( @xmath100 vs. the range @xmath101 in @xcite ) , and for a much longer duration ( @xmath102yr vs. @xmath103 hrs in @xcite ; for a @xmath20 bh ) .",
    "the top portion of figure  [ fig : massloss ] shows a surface density map of an isothermal disk , in the mass  loss case , around @xmath61 days after the merger ( in the left panel ) . in the right panel of the same figure",
    ", we show the radial surface density profile of the same disk , together with the profile of an adiabatic disk with the same mass  loss .",
    "when the impact of the kick is not included , the perturbations are azimuthally symmetric , giving rise to concentric , outward  propagating ripples .",
    "the basic mechanism behind creating the ripples can be visualized simply as follows : at the moment of mass loss , each particle , orbiting at its original keplerian velocity , is moving at a speed that is too fast for a circular orbit around the reduced central mass .",
    "as a result , all particles find themselves at the pericenter of a new , elliptical orbit . summing the effective contributions of each particle to the surface density , spread over these orbits , results in a net _ dilution _ of the disk .",
    "furthermore , the radial epicyclic oscillations of the set of particles at a fixed initial radius will occur at a frequency that monotonically decreases radially outward , resulting in a pattern of quasi  periodic compression / decompression in the radial direction .",
    "the resulting density spikes have lower amplitudes , but are more frequent toward the inner boundary .",
    "these effects are clearly seen in figure  [ fig : massloss ] except that , notably , the pressure forces in the adiabatic case are sufficient to almost completely wash out the innermost density ripples , out to @xmath104 , by @xmath61 days .    when a kick is included in addition to the mass - loss ( _ mkiso3 _ ) , the density enhancements are often lower in comparison to the kick - only case ( _ kiso3 _ ) .",
    "the bottom portion of figure  [ fig : massloss ] shows a map of the surface density and a radial slice of the surface density profile along the azimuth @xmath105 ( running in the direction of the -@xmath106 axis ) in both cases .",
    "the density enhancement from the mass ",
    "loss + kick run is appreciably lower than in the kick - only case , especially for the outermost , densest spike , at @xmath107 .",
    "our adiabatic runs conserve energy , so , by definition , no energy loss occurs in these runs , and the disk has strictly zero luminosity . in reality , the disk will radiate  indeed , a prediction of its time  variable light ",
    "curve , following the merger , will be invaluable for identifying em counterparts to _ lisa _ sources .",
    "a realistic prediction requires solving for the vertical structure of the disk , as well as a treatment of radiative cooling and radiative transfer across the disk ( which is likely to be optically thick ; see below ) .",
    "while this is not possible in our 2d simulations , our isothermal runs allow us to calculate the energy dissipation occurring in the disk  this can serve as a rough , order  of  magnitude estimate for the disk luminosity .",
    "more specifically , at each time  step , flash solves euler s equations , expressed in conservation form , to update the total specific energy ( @xmath108 ) of each zone which includes the combined kinetic and internal energy . in our case ,",
    "the disk is cold , and the internal energy ( @xmath47 ) is very small compared to the kinetic energy of orbital motion , and is therefore a small fraction of the total energy @xmath108 .",
    "this can cause numerical inaccuracies , and we found that it was necessary to solve for @xmath47 explicitly , using an internal energy advection equation that is separate from the total energyug@xmath1093p2.pdf . ] .",

    "this qualitative difference is unsurprising , since the @xmath22disks are more centrally concentrated , and have more material in the inner regions , increasing the luminosities at early times .",
    "the mass  loss only case shows that a brighter and more prompt flare erupts after the merger , compared to the constant density disk ; again this is attributable to the larger amount of material near the central regions .",
    "when both mass  loss and a kick is included , we find a prompt flare , followed by a nearly steady luminosity , reduced by around @xmath163 from the kick  only case .",
    "overall , the light  curves in the @xmath22disk and constant  density cases are reassuringly similar , indicating that variations in the assumed initial disk profiles do not lead to order  of  magnitude changes in the predicted brightness of the after  glow .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss numerical effects from the inner and outer boundary of the simulation box , the dependence of our results on the spatial and time resolution , as well as numerically scaling our results to apply to black holes and disks with different physical sizes and kicks with different speeds .",
    "_ boundary conditions .",
    "_ both at the inner and the outer boundaries , we imposed `` outflow '' boundary conditions that maintain a zero pressure and density gradient at the edges of the simulation . to test the effect of these boundary conditions , we checked whether an unperturbed disk ( without any kick or mass  loss ) maintains its uniform circular kepler motion .",
    "we found that the outer disk , beyond @xmath164 , indeed remained undisturbed , but modest density ripples ( with over - densities @xmath165 ) were produced artificially inside @xmath166 .",
    "the amplitude of these numerical fluctuations are below the density enhancements excited by shocks in the disk ( see for example figures  [ fig : densrad ] and [ fig : rshock ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , this low  amplitude noise covers a large fraction of the surface area of the inner disk , and can dominate the total luminosity in the inner regions .",
    "this is a concern especially for the @xmath22 disks , in which the inner regions were also found to dominate the total luminosity .",
    "more specifically , we computed the luminosity inside @xmath164 in the unperturbed constant density and @xmath22disk models , and we found that they reach values larger than ( in the constant surface density disk cases ) or comparable ( in the @xmath22disk cases ) to the luminosities exhibited in the perturbed disks . in future work , we will attempt to identify the origin of this numerical noise , and to reduce its contribution to the luminosity . in the present paper , we simply derived luminosities outside @xmath167 , which are safe from numerical noise , but represent an underestimate the true total luminosity .",

    "the mach numbers decline from @xmath218 to @xmath219 in the same interval .",
    "this decline , however , is due to the increase in sound speed , rather than a decrease in the gas velocities .    assuming a disk profile with @xmath220 ( close to the one adopted in our @xmath22disk runs ) , and also that a constant fraction of the disk mass interior to the outermost spiral caustic is shocked ( @xmath221 ) and that the energy is released over the time  scale of @xmath222",

    "@xcite and @xcite have recently employed three  dimensional simulations to study the evolution of much smaller disks ( extending from @xmath101 and @xmath224 , respectively , compared to our @xmath100 ) on much shorter time ",
    "scales ( @xmath103 hrs and @xmath225 hrs , scaling to a @xmath226 bh ; compared to our @xmath227 days ) .",
    "since our flash simulation results are output at times that sample the disk evolution only every @xmath228days , we can not directly compare the behavior of our disks to those in @xcite and @xcite .    despite the mis  match in scales and different dimensionality , it is interesting to contrast the light  curves we find here with those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first note that the simulations in both @xcite and @xcite are adiabatic , i.e. , they are energy  conserving by construction . @xcite and @xcite present estimates for the luminosity by computing the volume  integral of the quantity @xmath229 , which is proportional to the local bremsstrahlung emissivity . as we discussed in ",
    "[ sec : observational ] above , the bremsstrahlung cooling time is exceedingly short , so if dissipation indeed tracked the bremsstrahlung emission , the adiabatic condition could not be maintained . if cooling were efficient",
    ", then one expects , instead , much stronger overdensities to develop than in the adiabatic case , which would , in turn , generically increase the cooling rate @xmath230 .    setting these inconsistency issues aside , in order to compare our results as directly as possible to @xcite and @xcite , we computed the quantity @xmath231 in both our adiabatic and isothermal simulations .",
    "unfortunately , this comparison is further complicated by the fact that our simulations are two  dimensional . in order to calculate the 3d gas densities and volume elements , @xmath232 and @xmath233 from the constant density disks , we assumed that the disk has the scale height @xmath234 obtained by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction ( here @xmath235 and @xmath236 are measured directly in the simulation run ) .",
    "this assumption should be reasonable , since we simulated @xmath237 dynamical times , except near the outer edge of the disk .",
    "note that if hydrostatic equilibrium was not established ( i.e. the disk was still expanding in the vertical direction , following the mass  loss or recoil ) , the disk would be thinner , and the 3d densities would be even higher than our estimates , increasing the predicted luminosities . finally , note that under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , and with @xmath238 , the bremsstrahlung integral becomes independent of temperature , @xmath239 const @xmath240 .",
    "days is caused by @xmath12220% of the original disk material exiting the simulation volume .",
    "_ upper panel : _ bremsstrahlung emission from our fiducial isothermal disk , experiencing both mass  loss and a kick ( _ mkiso3 _ ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows the corresponding luminosity from a uniform disk , as in the lower panel .",
    "the disk brightens , mostly due to the sharp density contrasts that develop . ]",
    "the solid curve in bottom panel in figure  [ fig : bremcdboth ] shows the evolution of @xmath241 in the mass  loss only , constant density disk runs .",
    "the light curve exhibits oscillations within the first 100 days after the merger , qualitatively similar to the dips and troughs found , on shorter time ",
    "scales , by both @xcite and @xcite . in particular , as in the those two studies ,",
    "the entire disk remains dimmer than prior to the mass  loss : the luminosity of the disk decays by @xmath242 over the course of a year . to understand this result better , we computed the time - dependent mean surface density @xmath243 of the simulated disk between @xmath244 .",
    "as noted above , the disk as a whole expands after the mass - loss , due to the sudden decrease in gravitational force from the central point mass .",
    "we show , by the dashed curve in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : bremcdboth ] , the bremsstrahlung luminosity that would result from a disk with the time  dependent surface density @xmath245 .",
    "the departure of the dashed curve from unity is therefore due entirely to changes in the total disk mass within the region @xmath244 , whereas the difference between the solid and dashed curve is caused entirely by inhomogeneities in the gas surface density in this region .",
    "as these two curves show , at early times , the drop in the luminosity is due mostly to inhomogeneities , whereas at late times , the dimming is caused by approximately 20% of the disk mass exiting the simulated region .",
    "note that at late times , the inhomogeneities actually cause an increase in the luminosity . at early times , inhomogeneities cause the luminosity to decrease . while naively one expects that inhomogeneities always boost the luminosity",
    ", we note that in the adiabatic case , the disk is effectively allowed to expand in the vertical direction , and inhomogeneities can cause a small overall decrease in the luminosity .    in comparison ,",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig : bremcdboth ] shows @xmath241 in our fiducial isothermal run ( _ kiso3 _ ) , which includes both a kick and a mass  loss . as in the bottom panel ,",
    "the dashed curve shows the luminosity from a uniform disk with the same total mass .",
    "as this figure shows , the luminosity significantly _ increases _ with time , and this increase is mostly due to the inhomogeneities ( note that the density contrasts are much higher than in the adiabatic case , and the isothermal disk does not expand in the vertical direction ) . interestingly , in this run that includes the kick , the total mass within the @xmath244 region increases , rather than decreases .    in summary , our constant  density , adiabatic disks , which include only mass  loss and no kick , show the same qualitative behavior as in @xcite and @xcite , namely oscillations in the luminosity , and a modest overall dimming of the disk , following the bh merger .",
    "however , using an isothermal , rather than an adiabatic equation of state and considering the impact of a kick , in addition to the mass  loss , tend to counter this dimming , and when combined , produce , instead a significant brightening of the disk - due mostly to the stronger density contrasts that develop in the isothermal case .",
    "in this paper , we used two  dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a circumbinary disk , to follow the effects of a velocity recoil and mass - loss of the central black hole binary , following the merger of the two black holes . from a suite of runs , we are able to draw two basic conclusions .",
    "first , the outward  propagating spiral shocks that develop in our simulations follow a pattern very similar to the caustics identified in collisionless disk @xcite .",
    "gas pressure has a modest overall impact on the propagation and on the overall morphology of the shocks . on the other hand , we find that the gas pressure , and the assumed equation of state , has a strong impact on the overdensities that develop and on the strengths of the shocks : isothermal , low ",
    "temperature disks have larger overdensities and stronger shocks .",
    "second , we have estimated an upper limit on the luminosity emerging from the disk experiencing a bh kick with @xmath246 , by measuring the effective dissipation that occurs , implicitly , in the simulations when an isothermal condition is imposed on the gas .",
    "the resulting luminosity is of order @xmath247 of the eddington limit for the @xmath1 bh used in the simulation , which suggests that the after  glow may be bright enough to be detectable .",
    "if the pre - merger disk has a luminosity below that of a standard steady - state thin accretion disk ( due to the evacuation of the inner regions of the disk ) , then the merger - induced kick will cause a significant ( order - of - magnitude , or larger ) brightening of the disk .",
    "we also estimated the effective black  body temperature of the radiation emerging from the optically thick disk .",
    "we found that as the disk brightens , the characteristic frequency increases with time , possibly offering a unique signature of the kick  induced emission . when the accompanying mass  loss of the merger remnant is included in our simulations , the density contrasts and luminosity from the spiral shocks decrease somewhat , but do not change dramatically in overall behavior .",
    "while our results are encouraging , and suggest that the em signature of the disturbed circumbinary disk may be detectable , this conclusion has to be verified in the future in improved models .",
    "in particular , a better estimate of the thermodynamics of the disk , with a realistic treatment of radiative cooling , should reveal how close the luminosity is to the values we obtained here , using the isothermal assumption ; by using three  dimensional simulations that resolve the vertical disk structure , and by following the vertical transfer of the radiation produced should clarify the robustness of our conclusions about the evolution of the characteristic emergent frequency .",
