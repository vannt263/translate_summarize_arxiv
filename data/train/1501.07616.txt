    "in many single molecule experiments beads that are attached to molecular motors are used to infer properties of the motor protein from the analysis of the trajectory of these probe particles .",

    "these approaches often comprise only one particle explicitly , representing the motor .",

    "various coarse - graining methods have been applied , e.g. , lumping together states of a discrete state space among which transitions are fast @xcite , averaging over states for discrete @xcite or continuous processes @xcite , eliminating single states from a network description @xcite or eliminating slow ( invisible ) degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it was found that , in general , coarse - graining has implications on the entropy production and , in particular @xcite , dissipation . in the context of biological systems and especially molecular motors , coarse - graining procedures mostly focus on eliminating selected states of the motor @xcite or on reducing continuous ( ratchet ) models to discrete - state models",

    "we introduce a coarse - graining procedure that allows to reduce molecular motor - bead models to effective one - particle models with discrete motor states with the external force acting directly on the effective motor particle .",
    "we eliminate the explicit dynamics of the probe particle completely still maintaining the correct local detailed balance condition for the effective motor transition rates and preserving the average currents of the system . as a main result",

    "so far , we have discussed coarse - graining only under ness conditions . in principle , the coarse - graining procedure as introduced in sections [ sec : cg - one ] and [ sec : cg - mult ] can also be applied to non - stationary states , e.g. , if the nucleotide concentrations are not constant and @xmath260 decreases with time @xcite .",
    "such a scenario would yield time - dependent @xmath119 s , net currents , ldb conditions and therefore also time - dependent coarse - grained rates .",
    "further generalizations might include other types of models representing the full system .",
    "while developed here for discrete motor models , the coarse - graining procedure should be also applicable to continuous motors moving in a tilted periodic potential where the potential minima will become the discrete states of the coarse - grained effective motor .",
    "the introduction of the index @xmath105 in principle also accounts for more involved potentials or free energy surfaces that depend on both the motor and the probe state .",
