    "let us consider a system with scalar continous order parameter @xmath3 in a volume @xmath4 and hamiltonian [ ( x)]= _ v d x [ ( ) ^2 + r^2(x ) ] [ 1.1 ] where @xmath5 .",
    "the spherical model of berlin and kac@xcite is obtained by considering the extensive random variable = _ v d x ^2(x ) [ 1.2 ] and computing equilibrium properties with the gaussian weight @xmath6=\\frac{1}{z_{\\text{g}}}e^{-\\frac{1}{t}{\\cal h}[\\vp]}$ ] under the microcanonical constraint @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a given number .",
    "the mean spherical model of lewis and wannier@xcite , instead , is obtained by imposing the constraint in the mean , or canonically @xmath9 which makes the model considerably easier to solve .",
    "the spherical model was originally introduced by berlin and kac as an exactly soluble model displaying critical phenomena .",
    "subsequently , the enforcement of a spherical constraint ( in either form microcanonical or canonical ) on the free part of non linear problems has become an extremely useful and practical way to generate mean field approximations .",
    "however , despite the great popularity of the method , it is usually overlooked that the equilibrium properties of the two models , as it was recognized early on , do coincide above but not below the critical point .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy was clarified first by lax@xcite and further investigated by yan and wannier@xcite .",
    "lastly , kac and thompson@xcite showed how to connect averages in the two models .",
    "as it is easy to understand , the microcanonical and canonical constraint are equivalent as long as the fluctuations @xmath10 are negligible .",
    "indeed , above the critical temperature @xmath11 one has the usual behavior for thermodynamic quantities @xmath12 not so below @xmath11 , where fluctuations of @xmath13 turn out to be finite and independent of the volume @xmath14    an important consequence of this , as we shall see in the following , is that the nature of the mixed state below @xmath11 is quite different in the two models .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate whether the two models are equivalent or not when considering the time dependent properties in the relaxation process following the quench from above to below the critical point .",
    "this is a relevant question since , in practice , dynamics can be solved only in the mean spherical case and in the literature it is given for granted that the mean spherical form of dynamics applies to the the spherical case as well .",
    "on the basis of the previous considerations , clarification of this point amounts to analyse the time evolution of @xmath15 . as we shall see , this depends on the order of the limits @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "namely , it turns out that if @xmath4 is kept finite during the relaxation there is a crossover from the preasymptotic behavior @xmath18 to the asymptotic one @xmath19 with the crossover time @xmath0 . instead , if @xmath17 from the outset , then @xmath15 stays negligible for any finite time since @xmath20 diverges .",
    "in any case , in the scaling regime @xmath1 , the time dependent evolution is identical in the two models , as usually assumed .",
    "although reassuring , this conclusion opens an unexpected and interesting problem when it comes to test the connection between static and dynamic properties introduced by cugliandolo and kurchan@xcite for mean field spin glass and then established in general by franz , mezard , parisi and peliti@xcite for slowly relaxing systems .",
    "dynamic quantities are the autocorrelation function @xmath21 and the integrated linear response function @xmath22 , while equilibrium properties are encoded into the overlap probability function @xmath23@xcite .",

    "therefore , the unperturbed overlap probability @xmath23 can be recovered from dynamics if @xmath25 coincides or it is simply related to @xmath23 .",
    "this happens for stochastically stable systems@xcite .",
    "formulated originally in the context of glassy systems , this connection between statics and dynamics applies also to phase ordering processes in non disordered systems@xcite .",
    "a detailed account of the latter case can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "now , the interesting point is that the spherical and mean spherical model do share the same relaxation properties , therefore the same @xmath26 and the same @xmath25 , while the corresponding unperturbed overlap probabilities are profoundly different .",
    "in particular , @xmath23 can be recovered from @xmath25 in the spherical model , but not in the mean spherical one .",
