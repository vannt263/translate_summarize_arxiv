    "one of the key elements in any implementation of spintronics is an efficient source of spin current.@xcite among the different methods available , dynamical spin injection from a ferromagnet metal ( fm ) into an adjacent nonmagnetic metal ( nm ) has been theoretically proposed @xcite and experimentally observed.@xcite in this method , in addition to a longitudinal static magnetic field , an oscillating transverse magnetic field is applied , inducing a magnetization precession in the fm .",
    "most of the angular momentum transferred to the fm by the oscillating field is dissipated through spin - relaxation processes in the bulk , but a small part survives as a spin current injected into the nm .",
    "the exotic electronic properties of graphene have captured the attentions of the physics community since the first experiments with this material.@xcite high mobility and a long spin - relaxation length are features that make graphene a promising passive element for spintronics.@xcite in addition , the enhancement of spin - scattering processes in graphene by adatoms or defects,@xcite which yields spin hall @xcite and the inverse spin hall effects , has led to proposals of graphene - based spin - pumping transistors.@xcite    recent experimental studies @xcite show an increase in the damping of the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) when a graphene sheet is placed in contact with a fm subject to an oscillating magnetic field .",
    "one interpretation of phenomenon is that part of the precessing magnetization leaks into the graphene sheet as a spin current , effectively leading to another channel of magnetization damping in addition to the relaxation mechanisms existing in the bulk of the fm .",
    "a time - dependent scattering theory @xcite based on the general theory of adiabatic quantum pumping @xcite relate the increase in the fmr damping to the magnitude of a phenomenological mixing conductance parameter ; further effort is necessary to describe microscopically the process of spin pumping into two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials , as well as to properly quantify the spin current in terms of materials and interface parameters .",
    "a recent study @xcite applied the time - dependent scattering theory to spin pumping in a insulating ferromagnet laid on top of a 2d metal . while insightful , this approach is not suitable for including disorder and spatial inhomogeneities such as adatoms ; and when applied to graphene , it was confined to the vicinity of the neutrality point .    in this paper",
    "we develop a microscopical formulation of spin pumping from a fm into a nm material .",
    "both the atomic structure of the materials and the particular geometry of the system can be taken into account exactly in this formulation .",
    "the spin current expression is written in terms of the green s function of the nm portion , allowing one to apply efficient recursive numerical methods for the computation of spin currents.@xcite another advantage of the formulation we present is the possibility to include accurate , microscopic models of spin - orbit coupling in the nm portion , as it relies on a spatial tight - binding representation of the system .",
    "another aspect that can be addressed with this formulation is the distinction between the angular momentum that relaxes at the interface and the part that flows into the nm .",
    "as it was shown in the experiment by singh and coauthors,@xcite where a fm was laid on top of a graphene sheet , even without graphene protruding away from the fm ( when no spin current injection is possible ) , the enhancement of damping is significant .",
    "this enhancement has been associated to two - magnnon scattering at the interface.@xcite however , in systems where graphene protrudes away from the fm , an extra damping has been measured due to the flow spin current into graphene . an atomistic study of such phenomenon",
    "is needed to discriminate the contribution of spin current from the surface relaxation in the enhanced damping .",

    "in this paper we address the problem of spin pumping in low - dimensional materials in contact with a fm where a precessing magnetization is induced . in such systems , itinerant electrons travel from the nm portion into the fm with a random spin orientation and back .",
