    "the physical properties of mott ( or charge transfer ) insulators are dominated by large on - site coulomb interactions @xmath5 which suppress charge fluctuations . quite generally ,",
    "the coulomb interactions lead then to strong electron correlations which frequently involve orbitally degenerate states , such as @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) states in transition metal compounds , and are responsible for quite complex behavior with often puzzling transport and magnetic properties.@xcite the theoretical understanding of this class of compounds , with the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites as a prominent example , @xcite has substantially advanced over the last decade , @xcite after it became clear that orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in these materials and have to be treated on equal footing with the electron spins , which has led to a rapidly developing field  _ orbital physics_.@xcite due to the strong onsite coulomb repulsion , charge fluctuations in the undoped parent compounds are almost entirely suppressed , and an adequate description of these strongly correlated insulators appears possible in terms of superexchange.@xcite at orbital degeneracy the superexchange interactions have a rather rich structure , represented by the so - called spin - orbital models , discovered three decades ago,@xcite and extensively studied in recent years .",
    "@xcite    although this field is already quite mature , and the first textbooks have already appeared,@xcite it has been realized only recently that the _ magnetic _ and the _ optical _ properties of such correlated insulators with partly filled @xmath8 orbitals are intimately related to each other , being just different experimental manifestations of the same underlying spin - orbital physics . @xcite",
    "while it is clear that the _ low - energy _ effective superexchange hamiltonian decides about the magnetic interactions , it is not immediately obvious that the _ high - energy _ optical excitations and their partial sum rules have the same roots and may be described by the superexchange as well .",
    "in fact , this interrelation between the magnetic and the optical properties makes it necessary to reanalyze the spin - orbital superexchange models , and to extract from them important constraints imposed by the theory on the system parameters .",
    "we will show that also the opposite holds  some general rules apply for the magnetic interactions in the correlated insulators with degenerate ( or almost degenerate ) orbitals , and therefore the magnetic measurements impose constraints on any realistic theory . at the same time",
    ", we shall argue that such experiments provide very useful information concerning the orbital order ( oo ) and the strength of quantum fluctuations in a given compound , which can next be employed to interpret other experiments , including the optical spectroscopy .",
    "the phenomena discussed in the present paper go well beyond the more familiar situation of a mott insulator without orbital degeneracy , or when the orbital degeneracy is lifted by strong jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions as for example in the high @xmath9 cuprate superconductors . in a mott insulator",
    "the optical conductivity is purely incoherent , and the optical response is found at energies which exceed the optical gap .",
    "when orbital degrees of freedom are absent , the optical gap is determined by the intraorbital coulomb interaction element @xmath10 .",
    "naively , one might expect that the high - energy charge excitations at energy @xmath11 , which contribute to the optical intensities , are unrelated to the low - energy magnetic phenomena . however , both energy scales are intimately related as the superexchange follows from the same charge excitations which are detected by the optical spectroscopy",
    ". the prominent example of this behavior is the nondegenerate hubbard model , where the virtual high - energy excitations determine the superexchange @xcite energy @xmath1  it decides , together with spin correlations , about the spectral weight of the upper hubbard band at half - filling.@xcite when temperature increases to an energy scale @xmath12 , the spin correlations are modified and the total spectral weight in the optical spectroscopy follows these changes .",
    "@xcite    the superexchange models for transition metal perovskites with partly filled degenerate orbitals have a more complex structure than for nondegenerate orbitals and allow both for antiferromagnetic ( af ) and for ferromagnetic ( fm ) superexchange.@xcite these different contributions to the superexchange result from the multiplet structure of excited transition metal ions which depends on the hund s exchange @xmath13 and generates a competition between high - spin and low - spin excitations .",
    "the exchange interactions are then intrinsically frustrated _ even on a cubic lattice _ , which enhances quantum effects both for @xmath3 , @xcite and for @xmath0 systems.@xcite this frustration",
    "is partly removed in anisotropic af phases , which break the cubic symmetry and effectively may lead to dimensionality changes , such as in @xmath14-type af phase realized in lamno@xmath4 , or in @xmath15-type af phase in lavo@xmath4 .",
    "while rather advanced many - body treatment of the quantum physics characteristic for spin - orbital models is required in general , we want to present here certain simple principles which help to understand the heart of the problem and give simple guidelines for interpreting experiments and finding relevant physical parameters of the spin - orbital models of _ undoped _ cubic insulators .",
    "we will argue that such an approach based upon classical oo is well justified in many known cases , as quantum phenomena are often quenched by the jahn - teller ( jt ) coupling between orbitals and the lattice distortions , which are present below structural phase transitions and induce oo both in spin - disordered and in spin - ordered phases .",
    "@xcite however , we will also discuss the prominent example of lavo@xmath4 , where assuming perfect oo or attempts to decouple spin and orbital fluctuations,@xcite fail in a spectacular way and give no more than a qualitative insight into certain limiting cases .",
    "significant corrections due to quantum phenomena that go beyond such simplified approaches are then necessary for a more quantitative understanding .    in the correlated insulators with partly occupied degenerate orbitals not only the structure of the superexchange",
    "is complex , but also the optical spectra exhibit strong anisotropy and temperature dependence near the magnetic transitions , as found in lamno@xmath4 , @xcite the cubic vanadates lavo@xmath4 and yvo@xmath4 , @xcite and in the ruthenates.@xcite in all these systems several excitations contribute to the excitation spectra , so one may ask how the spectral weight redistributes between individual subbands originating from these excitations .",
    "the spectral weight distribution is in general anisotropic already when oo sets in and breaks the cubic symmetry , but even more so when @xmath14-type or @xmath15-type",
    "af spin order occurs below the nel temperature .",
    "the effective spin - orbital models of transition metal oxides with partly filled degenerate orbitals depend in a characteristic way upon those aspects of the electronic structure which decide whether a given strongly correlated system can be classified as a mott insulator or as a charge transfer ( ct ) insulator .",
    "as suggested in the original classification of zaanen , sawatzky and allen,@xcite the energy of the @xmath16 ct excitation @xmath17 has to be compared with the coulomb interaction @xmath10  if @xmath18 , the first excitation is at a transition metal ion and the system is a mott insulator , otherwise it is a ct insulator .",
    "both are strongly correlated insulators , yet in one limit the dominant virtual excitations are of @xmath19 type , whereas in the other limit they are of @xmath20 type .",
    "one may consider this issue more precisely by analyzing the full multiplet structure , and comparing the lowest excitation energy ( to a high - spin configuration ) _ at a transition metal ion _",
    ", @xmath21 , with that of the lowest ct excitation ( of energy @xmath17 ) _ between a transition metal ion and a ligand ion_. @xcite thus we argue that one can regard a given perovskite as a _ charge transfer insulator _ if @xmath22 , and as a _ mott - hubbard insulator _ if @xmath23 . by analyzing these parameters",
    "it has been suggested that the late transition metal oxides may be classified as ct insulators.@xcite in this case important new contributions to the superexchange arise , @xcite called below @xmath17 ( charge transfer ) terms , as we shall discuss for two @xmath3 systems : kcuf@xmath4 and lamno@xmath4 .",
    "a central aim of this paper is to provide relatively simple expressions for the magnetic exchange constants and for the optical spectral weights that can be used by experimentalists to analyze and compare their spin wave data with optical data .",
    "while the full spin - orbital models are rather complex , they are nevertheless controlled by only very few physical parameters : ( i ) the superexchange constant @xmath1 , ( ii ) the normalized hund s exchange @xmath2 , and ( iii ) the charge transfer parameter @xmath24 .",
    "there are two distinct ways to determine these effective parameters : either ( i ) from the original multiband hubbard model , or ( ii ) from experimental spin wave and/or optical data . here",
    "the second approach is of particular interest because the simultaneous analysis of magnetism and optics provides a subtle test of the underlying model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the generic structure of the low - energy effective hamiltonian in a correlated insulator with orbital degeneracy , and discuss its connection with the optical excitations at high - energy .",
    "this general formulation provides the important subdivision of a given spin - orbital model which is necessary to obtain the partial spectral weights for individual multiplet transitions . in the remaining part of the paper we concentrate on some selected cubic perovskites and",
    "demonstrate that this general formulation allows one to arrive at a consistent interpretation of the magnetic and optical experiments in these correlated insulators using the superexchange interactions ( secs .",
    "iii - vi ) , and to deduce the parameters relevant for the theoretical model from the experimental data , whereever available .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "iii with the simplest spin - orbital model for @xmath3 holes in kcuf@xmath4 , and demonstrate that this system is in the ct regime which changes the commonly used picture of superexchange in this system in a qualitative way .",
    "next we present and analyze the spin - orbital model with @xmath3 orbital degrees of freedom for the undoped manganite lamno@xmath4 in sec .",
    "we show that in this case much smaller contributions arise from the ct processes , and the system is already in the mott - hubbard regime of parameters , which explains the earlier success of a simplified effective model based entirely on @xmath19 excitations and sufficient for a semiquantitative understanding .",
    "this justifies our approach to the early transition metal perovskites with @xmath0 degrees of freedom , titanates in sec .",
    "v and vanadates in sec .",
    "vi , which we treat as mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "for all these systems we analyze the magnetic exchange interactions and the optical spectral weights , depending on the nature of the spin correlations in the ground state .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "vii , where we provide a coherent view on the magnetic and the optical phenomena and summarize the experimental constraints on the model parameters .",
    "we consider here effective models with hopping elements between transition metal ions , @xmath25 here @xmath26 are orbital energies , and @xmath27 are effective hopping elements via ligand orbitals  they depend on the type of considered orbitals as discussed in refs . and .",
    "the energy scale for the hopping is set by the largest hopping element @xmath28 : the @xmath29 element in case of @xmath3 systems , and the @xmath30 element when only @xmath31 bonds are considered in systems with degenerate and partly filled @xmath0 orbitals . for noninteracting electrons the hamiltonian @xmath32 would lead to tight - binding bands , but in a mott insulator the large coulomb interaction @xmath10 suppresses charge excitations in the regime of @xmath33 , and the hopping elements",
    "can only contribute via virtual excitations , leading to the superexchange .",
    "the superexchange in the @xmath6 _ cubic _ systems with orbital degeneracy is described by spin - orbital models , where both degrees of freedom are coupled and the orbital state ( ordered or fluctuating ) determines the spin structure and excitations , and vice versa . the numerical and analytical structure of these models represents a fascinating challenge in the theory , as it is much more complex than that of pure spin models .",
    "the spin - orbital models have been derived before in several cases , and we refer for these derivations to the original literature.@xcite they describe in low energy regime the consequences of virtual charge excitations between two neighboring transition metal ions , @xmath34 , which involve an increase of energy due to the coulomb interactions .",

    "the electrons are almost localized and the only kinetic energy which is left is associated with the same virtual charge excitations that contribute also to the superexchange .",
