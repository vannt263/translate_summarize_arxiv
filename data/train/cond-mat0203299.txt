    "the @xmath0 model with quenched random phase shifts as a model for a superconducting glass has been intensively investigated over the last decade , focusing on the so - called gauge glass model which corresponds to the case with maximal disorder . since",

    "the existence of disorder , which destroys the flux lattice structure , is essential to pin the vortices in order for a superconducting phase to exist in a high @xmath9 superconductor @xcite .",
    "although there exists no proof whether or not the gauge glass and vortex glass are in the same universality class , it is of interest as the simplest model of a disordered superconductor and is still not understood despite all the effort expended on it . from numerical@xcite and experimental @xcite studies , it is believed that the gauge glass has no ordered phase at any finite temperature in two dimensions . in three dimensions , numerical domain wall renormalization group ( dwrg ) studies@xcite",
    "indicate that the lower critical dimension seems to be close to three .",
    "however the situation is less conclusive , since the simulations are limited to small system sizes .",
    "finite temperature monte carlo studies yield a transition temperature @xmath10@xcite which is difficult to reconcile with dwrg studies@xcite as these studies imply that the lower critical dimension for superconducting glass order is close to three .",

    "the hamiltonian of the xy model with random quenched disorder can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an even , @xmath13 periodic function of @xmath14 with a maximum at @xmath15 and minimum at @xmath16 , usually taken as @xmath17 .",

    "however , recent analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite studies suggest the absence of a re - entrant transition and that there exists an ordered phase for @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "when the random bond variables @xmath20 are restricted to @xmath33 or @xmath34 with equal probabilities , this model reduces to the @xmath5 @xmath0 spin glass , which is believed to be in a different universality class due to the additional reflection symmetry @xcite which is absent in the case of uniformly or gaussian distributed @xmath20 .",
    "an @xmath0 spin glass may have both spin and chiral glass order associated with rotational and reflection symmetry , respectively .",
    "it has been suggested that , in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , spin and chiral variables decouple at long distances and order independently @xcite , and the lower critical dimensions are @xmath35 for spin glass order and @xmath36 for chiral glass order .",
    "however , the decoupling scenario contradicts the analytic studies on a ladder lattice @xcite , on a tube lattice @xcite , and on a @xmath1 lattice with a special choice of disorder @xcite .",

    ", we re - investigate the possibility of an ordered phase at small but finite temperature @xmath38 by a numerical domain wall renormalization group ( dwrg)@xcite , or defect energy scaling .",
    "the domain wall or defect energy of the system is computed by using the hamiltonian in the coulomb gas ( vortex ) representation , which is more convenient for numerical work as it eliminates spin wave contributions to the energy .",
    "although the conventional dwrg method can handle only the scaling of the coupling constant @xmath39 at scale @xmath8 , which is proportional to the domain wall or defect energy , our method enables us to study the flows of both the coupling constant and the disorder strength , @xmath40 , at length scale @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we apply this to the case of general disorder strength , @xmath22 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : strategy ] we discuss the dwrg method and also our strategy . in section [ sec :",
    "cg ] , we explicitly perform the transformation of the @xmath2 hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) from the phase to the coulomb gas representation .",
    "our numerical method is explained in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "finally we discuss our numerical results in section [ sec : results ] and give a brief discussion of some of the effects of weak disorder , @xmath41 , and of finite screening of vortex - vortex interactions .",
    "the general idea behind a dwrg is to compute , analytically or numerically , the energy @xmath42 of a domain wall in a system of linear size @xmath8 and fit this to a finite size scaling form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a stiffness exponent , whose sign is of fundamental importance . if @xmath45 , @xmath42 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the energy of the domain wall or defect excitation vanishes which implies that , for @xmath46 , the probability of the defect @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "this in turn implies that the density of such defects is finite when @xmath46 and there will be no resistance to an infinitesimal applied force and the system has no order .",
    "this is analogous to the vanishing of the shear modulus in a liquid , the superfluid density in a superfluid or superconductor and the spin stiffness constant in an isotropic magnet when @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath50 , such defects will have zero probability when @xmath51 and the system will have finite stiffness and will be ordered at sufficiently small @xmath46 . in a uniform system without disorder ,",
    "the definition of the energy of a domain wall of size @xmath8 , @xmath42 , is intuitively obvious .",
    "the first step is to find the ground state ( gs ) energy of a system of size @xmath8 , which requires applying boundary conditions ( bc ) which are compatible with the gs configuration . for a ferromagnet ,",
    "this is straightforward to implement as the gs configuration is known to be one with all spins parallel and periodic bc are compatible with this . to impose a spin domain wall perpendicular to the @xmath52 direction , one simply changes the bc to antiperiodic along @xmath52 and periodic in the other @xmath53 directions .",
    "then it immediately follows that @xmath54 where @xmath55 for an ising model and @xmath56 for a system with a continuous symmetry such as @xmath0 and heisenberg models .",
    "one would like to use the same strategy for _ random _ systems described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , as suggested by anderson for ising spin glasses@xcite .",
    "however , it is not so clear how to proceed because , for a particular sample ( realization of disorder ) , neither the gs configuration nor compatible bc is known so computing the defect energy @xmath42 is problematical . assuming @xmath42 can be calculated , the stiffness exponent is defined by the scaling _ ansatz _",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes an average over realizations of disorder . to our knowledge , it is not known how to calculate _ analytically _ either the gs energy @xmath59 or the energy @xmath60 of the system containing a defect _ relative to this gs _ which means that one must proceed numerically .",
    "a number of conceptual and technical difficulties are apparent .",
    "the first , and most important , is the technical problem of computing the energy difference @xmath42 between the energies of the system subject to two different bc .",
    "we ultimately want the disorder averaged defect energy @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the lowest energy of a particular sample subject to bc denoted by @xmath63 and @xmath64 with bc denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "we need the individual energies @xmath62 and @xmath64 essentially _ exactly _ because the uncertainty in @xmath66 must be kept as small as possible .",
    "also , to our knowledge , there is no proof that the scaling ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss ] ) is a correct description and , even if it is , the only thing we can be sure of is @xmath67 .",
    "all results are based on fitting data to the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss ] ) so one is attempting _ both _ to verify the scaling ansatz and to estimate a numerical value of @xmath44 . for any conclusion to be believable",
    ", the data must have both very small errors and fit eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss ] ) extremely well .",
    "the first requirement of highly accurate data is the most important as the estimate of @xmath44 depends on this . assuming that @xmath62 and @xmath64 can be determined exactly for each sample , then @xmath42 is also known exactly for each sample and the errors in @xmath68 are @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of samples of size @xmath8 in @xmath71 dimensions .",
    "if the energy minima @xmath72 are not found exactly , a crude estimate of the errors in @xmath42 is @xmath73 but this is certainly too low as failure of the algorithm to find the true minima because of being trapped in a metastable state of energy @xmath74 will cause systematic errors of unknown magnitude .",
    "empirically , we find that this can readily cause errors larger than @xmath68 which makes the data point useless .",
    "this is most likely to happen for large @xmath8 because the cpu time required grows uncontrollably , as do the errors , so the large @xmath8 data becomes unreliable .",
    "this technical difficulty limits the accessible sizes @xmath8 to small values as one must keep errors in individual data points small .",
    "we are forced to conclude that the accessible sizes @xmath8 are limited by the necessity of finding essentially exact global energy minima of each of a number @xmath70 of samples subject to certain , yet to be defined , bc . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no algorithm applicable to the systems of interest which will find exact minima in polynomial time , such as the branch and cut algorithm@xcite for the @xmath1 ising spin glass or numerically exact combinatorial optimization algorithms @xcite for gauge and vortex glass models in the infinite screening limit , so we have to live with the fact that our problem is np complete and the required cpu time explodes as @xmath8 increases .",
    "we use simulated annealing@xcite to estimate the lowest energies , which seems considerably more efficient than simple quenching to @xmath75 , but we are unable to go beyond @xmath76 in @xmath2 and @xmath77 in @xmath1 .",
    "we wish to extract the stiffness exponent @xmath44 from the scaling ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fss ] ) with a single power law and this makes sense only if the errors on individual data points are very small and the fit to the assumed scaling form is extremely good . in our opinion ,",
    "the only sensible strategy is to obtain very accurate estimates of @xmath68 for the limited sizes @xmath8 which are feasible for the computer power available . in the phase representation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , the configuration space to be searched for the global energy minima @xmath72 is rather large as the phases @xmath78 $ ] are continuous variables . searching this space in finite time is not feasible as most of the allowed configurations of the @xmath23 are not even local energy minima .",
    "it is well known that random @xmath0 models with a hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) can be written in a coulomb gas ( cg ) or vortex representation via a duality transformation@xcite which leaves the partition function invariant .",
    "this expresses the hamiltonian in terms of charge or vortex configurations which are _ already _ local energy minima @xcite .",
    "thus , a reformulation of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) as a cg performs a partial minimization .",
    "a further minimization of the cg hamiltonian corresponds to searching the much smaller space of local minima .",
    "reformulating the problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) including the bc in cg language is clearly a worthwhile exercise as it dramatically reduces the number of configurations over which we have to minimize , despite introducing long - ranged coulomb interactions between vortices .",
    "the transformation is carried out in section [ sec : cg ] for the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) in @xmath2 .",
    "the final problem is to define what is meant by a domain wall and the bc needed to induce a wall in a finite system of size @xmath8 in @xmath71 dimensions .",

    "@xmath84 on opposite faces are coupled by some interaction @xmath85 which may be regarded as defining the bc . in principle , the gs is obtained by minimizing the energy with respect to the @xmath86 bulk variables @xmath23 and all forms of @xmath87 .",
    "this program is beyond our ability and we restrict ourselves to those @xmath87 which induce a spin or chiral defect , which are related to the continuous and reflection symmetry respectively . to impose a spin defect , we choose @xmath88 .",
    "the plaquettes between the opposite faces are indistinguishable from the others and play no special role .",
    "we therefore keep fixed the frustrations @xmath89 where the sum is over the bonds in a clockwise direction of the elementary plaquette centered at @xmath90 .",
    "we still have the freedom to add @xmath91 to every bond in the @xmath92 direction between opposite faces which imposes a global twist @xmath91 in the phase round a loop circling the hypertorus in the direction @xmath92 .",
    "this is equivalent to a gauge transformation @xmath93 on every bond @xmath94 in the direction @xmath92 . the lowest energy , @xmath95 , is @xmath13 periodic in @xmath91 with a minimum at some @xmath96 which depends on the sample . to induce a spin domain wall normal to @xmath97 , one changes the twists from their best twist ( bt ) values @xmath98 .",
    "the minimum energy subject to this constraint gives @xmath99 , the energy of the system of size @xmath8 containing an extra spin defect .",
    "note that @xmath100 for every sample but @xmath101 is not necessarily the absolute minimum as some other functional form of @xmath87 may give a lower energy .",
    "however , even if @xmath101 is not the true gs energy but is the energy of a state with some excitation from the gs , this method of inducing a spin defect ensures that any excitation in the bt configuration will also be present in the state with an extra spin domain wall so that @xmath102 is not affected by these .",
    "it is convenient , but not necessary , to define the spin defect energy by a twist of @xmath34 from the bt value @xmath103 .",
    "this choice yields the maximum defect energy @xmath42 .",
    "any other choice @xmath104 yields the same spin stiffness exponent @xmath105 defined by @xmath106 the size @xmath107 of the twist from the bt value @xmath108 affects only the amplitude @xmath109 which is a maximum at @xmath110 .",
    "a chiral domain wall is induced by imposing reflective bc@xcite which means that corresponding sites @xmath111 on opposite faces are connected by interactions @xmath112 which is equivalent to a reflection of the spins about some axis . in principle , one follows the procedure for a spin domain wall to obtain the chiral defect energy @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the minimum energy of the system with these modified interactions @xmath87 connecting opposite faces .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect @xmath115 as the bc defining @xmath101 may trap a chiral defect in some samples and , in such cases , the modified interactions @xmath87 will cancel the chiral defect to give @xmath116 .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed previously in numerical simulations of the @xmath0 spin glass@xcite .",
    "we therefore define the chiral defect energy as @xmath117 and the chiral stiffness exponent @xmath118 by a finite size scaling ansatz analogous to eq .",

    "the hamiltonian with uniform distribution of @xmath20 such as a gauge glass is not truly invariant under reflection which would also require @xmath123 for the hamiltonian to be invariant as it lacks the reflection symmetry .",
