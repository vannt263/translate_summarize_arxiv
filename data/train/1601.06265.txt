    "in fact , for real analytic cuspidal edges and swallowtails , the corresponding problems are solved affirmatively by kossowski @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . moreover , the moduli of isometric deformations of a given generic real analytic germ of cuspidal edge singularity was completely determined in @xcite . in this paper , we construct all isometric realizations of a given whitney metric germ at their singularities as formal power series solutions of the problem .",
    "the above family of invariants @xmath9 corresponds to the coefficients of the taylor expansion of a certain realization of the whitney metric associated to a given cross cap singular point .",
