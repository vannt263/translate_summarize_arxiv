    "the concept  @xcite that a representation of the distribution of barriers  @xcite , encountered by two colliding nuclei can experimentally be determined  @xcite from precisely measured fusion excitation functions has led to a renewed interest  @xcite in heavy ",
    "ion fusion studies near the coulomb barrier .",
    "these experiments have shown that the dominant factors , i.e. , the nature of couplings , affecting the fusion probability can be very clearly seen in a barrier distribution representation . with the advent of this new tool and the new measurements ,",
    "it is interesting to re  visit the problem of fusion of two doubly closed shell nuclei , the @xmath0o  + @xmath1pb  system ; detailed analysis  @xcite performed previously could not reproduce the fusion cross - section and the mean square angular momentum by coupled channel calculations . apart from the interest in the reaction process itself , another aspect is to identify the state(s ) in @xmath1pb  which couple strongly and thus contribute to the shape of the barrier distribution in this reaction . with this knowledge ,",
    "@xmath1pb  can then be used as a probe in understanding the barrier distributions in reactions with other nuclei ; this is an advantage due to the large @xmath2 of @xmath1pb , leading to large coupling strength and hence well _ resolved _ barrier distributions .",
    "further , understanding the reaction mechanism may also have implications in the reactions to produce super  heavy elements , many of which have @xmath1pb  as one of the reaction partners .",
    "the experiments were performed using pulsed @xmath0o  beams from the 14ud pelletron accelerator at the australian national university . isotopically enriched targets of lead in the form of @xmath1pbs of thicknesses @xmath323@xmath4 and @xmath3350@xmath4 evaporated onto a @xmath310@xmath4 carbon backing were used for the fission ",
    "fragment and evaporation residue measurements respectively .",
    "the fission fragments were detected in two large  area position sensitive multiwire proportional counters in the forward and backward hemispheres .",
    "fission events were identified by their energy loss , time  of  flight information with respect to the pulsed beam .",
    "the angular distributions of the fission  fragments , obtained from the position information , were used to calculate the total fission cross - sections as detailed in ref .",
    "two silicon surface barrier detectors located at @xmath522@xmath6 were used to detect elastically scattered events for normalization purposes .    for the measurements of evaporation residues an aluminium catcher foil",
    "was placed behind the target in order to stop the recoiling products .",
    "the evaporation residue cross - section was measured by detecting the @xmath7activity from the decay er and their daughters , using an annular silicon surface barrier detector as detailed in ref .",
    "the total fusion cross - section was obtained by summing the fission and evaporation residue cross  sections .",
    "the results of the measurements are presented in two forms : ( i ) total fusion excitation functions and ( ii ) the function @xmath8 , where e is the energy and @xmath9 is the fusion cross - section . it has been shown  @xcite that the quantity @xmath8 gives a representation of the distribution of barriers , and in the following discussions will be referred to as the _ barrier distribution_. this quantity has been extracted from the fusion data using the point difference formula  @xcite with a step length of 1.86  mev in centre  of  mass frame .",
    "the theoretical excitation functions have been treated in exactly the same way as the experimental data to obtain the theoretically expected barrier distributions .",
    "calculations have been performed using a realistic coupled channel code  @xcite .",
    "the results of simplified coupled channels code ccmod  @xcite which is a modified version of the code ccdef  @xcite are also presented for comparison .      the measured excitation function and the extracted barrier distribution is presented in figure  1 along with the predictions of a single  barrier penetration model ( no coupling ) .",
    "the best fit to the high energy data requires a diffuseness of 0.85  @xmath10 , and yields values of @xmath11  =  74.8  mev , @xmath12  =  11.6  @xmath10 for the barrier height and position respectively . as in this case , a fit to the fusion data for other systems  @xcite , with calculations in the no  coupling limit also required large values of the diffuseness parameter .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite explicitly for the @xmath0o+@xmath13sm system that the large diffuseness is a result of not considering the couplings to all orders .",
    "this seems to be true for the @xmath0o+@xmath1pb system too , as calculations ( i ) with @xmath14  =  0.85  @xmath10 and no couplings and ( ii ) with @xmath14  =  0.65  @xmath10 but including the 2phonon couplings ( see section 3.3 ) , fit the high energy data equally well .",
    "the best fit woods ",
    "saxon potential parameters for the latter , obtained by fixing @xmath14  =  0.65  fm are , @xmath15  =  235.5  mev , @xmath16  =  1.1  @xmath10 for the depth and radius parameter , yielding barrier parameters of @xmath11  =  75.2  mev , @xmath12  =  11.85  @xmath10 and @xmath17  =  5.0  mev .",
    "all the calculations in this paper have been performed with these parameters .",
    "the calculations which do not include any couplings underpredict the excitation function as also indicated by the comparison of barrier distributions , where experimentally there is significant strength below ( and above ) the single  barrier .",
    "the failure of the no  coupling calculations to reproduce the wide experimental barrier distribution clearly indicates that couplings with other channels need to be considered .",
    "comprehensive coupled channel analysis of elastic , inelastic and fusion cross  sections were performed by thompson  @xcite with the inclusion of the lowest 2@xmath18 , 3@xmath19 and 5@xmath19 states of @xmath1pb  and 3@xmath19 state of @xmath0o  in addition to neutron pick  up ,",
    "proton stripping and @xmath7transfer channels . in this paper , only the inelastic excitations have been included in the coupled channel calculations .",
    "it was shown in reference  @xcite that the @xmath7transfer channel , despite its large cross - section , has very little effect on the fusion cross - section .",
    "further , past studies  @xcite which have included couplings to transfer channels , show that while couplings to @xmath20 transfer channels increase the sub  barrier cross  sections , they do not significantly effect the cross  sections at higher beam energies ; the effect of @xmath21 transfer channels is less significant when couplings to inelastic channels are present .",
    "thus , it is expected that for the @xmath0o  +  @xmath1pb system , where the single  nucleon transfers q  values are negative , the dominant features of the fusion barrier distribution will be due to couplings to inelastic channels .",
    "the solid lines in figure  1 shows results of realistic coupled channels calculation  @xcite which includes couplings to the 2@xmath18 , 3@xmath19 and 5@xmath19 vibrational states in @xmath1pb  .",
    "coupling to the 3@xmath19 state of @xmath0o  has not been considered in any of the calculations presented here , as it gives rise to a shift in the barrier distribution without changing its shape i.e. , in this reaction its effects are only to renormalize the real potential . the equivalent ccmod  @xcite calculations are shown by the dashed line for comparison ; the differences are due to the approximations inherent in a simplified coupled channels calculation , mainly the linear coupling approximation ( derivative form  factors ) and the approximate treatment of excitation energies of the intrinsic states . as seen from the figure",
    ", the coupled channel calculations fail to reproduce the experimental barrier distribution and the low energy part of the excitation function .",
    "the calculations predict a double peaked structure as opposed to the more complex structure seen experimentally ; the calculations miss the barrier strength at the lowest energies and also at around 77  mev .",
    "it should be noted that the double  peaked structure of the calculated barrier distribution will remain essentially unchanged even when couplings to other single  phonon states is considered .",
    "the agreement can not be improved by increasing the coupling strength which , while decreasing the weight of the lower barrier will simultaneously shift the higher barrier to still higher energies .",
    "it is thus clear that couplings to single phonon states in @xmath1pb are not sufficient to explain the data .",
    "as detailed above , calculations with couplings to only 1phonon states are unable to generate a barrier(s ) which lies at an energy intermediate between the main barrier and the higher barrier predicted by these calculations .",
    "thus some other mechanism has to be considered . using an eigenchannel approximation",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that whereas in the case of coupling to a single phonon state , the lower and the higher barrier repel each other , the introduction of 2phonon state results in the separation of the lower two barriers being smaller , and the introduction of a third barrier . in the present case",
    ", the experimental barrier distribution would seem to indicate this scenario .",
    "the existence of two phonon octupole excitations in @xmath1pb  was recently shown  @xcite experimentally . coupled channel calculations including the 2@xmath18 , 3@xmath19 , 3@xmath223@xmath19 and 5@xmath19 vibrational states in @xmath1pb  and all the resulting cross  coupling terms e.g. , 2@xmath233@xmath19 etc ,",
    "were performed ; the double phonon state was treated in the harmonic limit .",
    "the results are shown by the solid line in fig .  2 ;",
    "the equivalent ccmod calculations are shown by dashed line .",
    "it is clear that the excitation function and the shape of the barrier distribution is better reproduced in the 2phonon calculations compared with the 1phonon calculations .",
    "however , the lower energy part of the excitation function and barrier distribution is still not reproduced . a priori",
    ", one might assign the disagreement to be caused by ignoring the couplings to transfer channels , since it is known  @xcite that coupling to positive q ",
    "value transfer channels can introduce a barrier at lower energies . even though it is recognised that yields of transfer cross ",
    "sections do not necessarily correlate with their coupling to the elastic channel , it is relevant to point out that for the case of @xmath0o  +  @xmath1pb , the n , p and @xmath7transfer reactions observed  @xcite at energies near the barrier have negative q  values .",
    "this could be taken as an indication that the low energy shoulder is unlikely to be due to couplings to transfer channels .",
    "further , a lower barrier with significant strength and close to the main barrier requires a strongly coupled channel and since the coupling between the elastic and transfer channels are generally small in comparison with inelastic channels , it would be difficult to reproduce the observed barrier distribution by couplings to transfer channels only .",
    "due to limitations of the coupled channels code , at present we are unable to perform the calculations including transfer channels to investigate these suggestions .",
    "comparison of the experimentally measured barrier distribution with the results of coupled channel calculations show that coupling to double octupole phonon excitations in @xmath1pb  are necessary to explain the fusion cross  sections .",
    "the experiment shows the presence of another lower barrier which could not be reproduced by these calculations .",
    "while this barrier(s ) might arise due to couplings to transfer channels , not included in the present treatment , it is unlikely to reproduce the shape of the barrier distribution as discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "one might have to look for other reasons like effects of anharmonicities of the 2phonon state in @xmath1pb  as discussed by takigawa during this conference .",
    "it is interesting that the dynamics of the fusion process even for reactions between two closed shell nuclei , which might be thought to be a simple process particularly at low energies , is affected by complex surface vibrations like the 2phonon states .",
    "furthermore , the barrier distribution picture indicates that there are other subtle features of the @xmath0o + @xmath1pb reaction which have yet to be understood , indicating that experiments are being done at a level of precision where a better understanding of the approximations in the theoretical calculations is required .",
