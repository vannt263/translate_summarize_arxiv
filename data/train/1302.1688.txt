    "the investigation of quantum effects in fixed gravitational backgrounds is among the most interesting topics in quantum field theory ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "these effects may have important implications in black hole physics and in cosmology .",
    "the presence of the gravitational field , in general , reduces the number of symmetries and exact results can be obtained for highly symmetric backgrounds only",
    ". a better understanding of physical effects in these backgrounds could serve as a handle to deal with more complicated geometries . in this context , the investigation of quantum field theoretical effects in de sitter ( ds ) spacetime is of special interest . in inflationary scenario",
    "an approximately ds spacetime is employed to solve the problem of initial conditions in standard cosmology @xcite . during an inflationary epoch in the early universe",
    "the quantum fluctuations play a crucial role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "more recently observations of high - redshift type ia supernovae , galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that at the present epoch the universe is accelerating and is well approximated by a model with a positive cosmological constant as a dominant source for the expansion .",
    "if the universe would accelerate indefinitely , the standard cosmology would lead to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "therefore , the investigation of physical effects in ds spacetime is important for understanding both the early universe and its future . an interesting topic which has received increasing attention",
    "is related to string - theoretical models of ds spacetime and inflation .",
    "a number of constructions of metastable ds vacua were discussed within the framework of string theory ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    "much attention has been paid to the possibility for the universe to have non - trivial topology . in particular , a number of fundamental physical theories are formulated in spacetimes with compact extra dimensions .",
    "the idea of compactified dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories .",
    "the models of a compact universe with non - trivial topology may play an important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation @xcite .",
    "the quantum creation of the universe having toroidal spatial topology is discussed in zeld84 and in refs .",
    "@xcite within the framework of supergravity theories . as it was argued in refs",
    "@xcite , there is no reason to believe that the version of ds spacetime which may emerge from string theory , will necessarily be the most familiar version with symmetry group @xmath1 and there are many different topological spaces which can accept the ds metric locally .",
    "there are several reasons to expect that in string theory the most natural topology for the universe is that of a flat compact three - manifold .",
    "the non - trivial topology of the background space can have important physical implications in quantum field theory .",
    "the periodicity conditions imposed on fields along compact dimensions give rise to the modification of the spectrum for normal modes and , related to this , the expectation values of physical observables are changed .",
    "a well known effect of this type , demonstrating the connection between quantum phenomena and global properties of spacetime , is the topological casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy of bulk fields induces a non - trivial potential for the compactification radius providing a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields and thereby fixing the effective gauge couplings .",
    "the casimir effect has also been considered as a possible origin for the dark energy in both kaluza - klein - type and braneworld models @xcite .",
    "one - loop quantum effects for scalar and dirac spinor fields induced by the toroidal compactification of spatial dimensions in ds spacetime have been recently investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor are considered for untwisted and twisted fields .",
    "these quantities are among the most important local characteristics of the quantum vacuum and are closely related with the structure of spacetime through the theory of gravitation . for charged fields another important bilinear characteristic is the vev of the current density .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the current acts as the source in the maxwell equations and plays an important role in modeling a self - consistent dynamics involving the electromagnetic field .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the combined effects of topology and the gravitational field on the vevs of the current density for charged scalar and fermionic fields in the background of ds spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions . along compact dimensions",
    "we impose generic quasiperiodic boundary conditions with arbitrary phases which , as special cases , include the periodicity conditions for untwisted and twisted fields .",
    "in addition , the presence of a classical constant gauge field will be assumed .",
    "as it will be seen , this leads to aharonov - bohm - like effects on the vev  of the current density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the background geometry and evaluate the hadamard function for a complex scalar field assuming that the field is prepared in the bunch - davies vacuum state . by using this function , in section [ sec : sc ] ,",
    "we investigate the vev of the current density .",
    "the current density for the dirac spinor field is discussed in section [ sec : ferm ] .",
    "the main results are summarized in section sec : conc .",
    "in the present paper the background geometry is described by the @xmath0-dimensional ds line - element in planar coordinates:@xmath2 in the case of trivial topology , the metric tensor corresponding to eq .",
    "( ds2 ) is the maximally symmetric vacuum solution of einstein equations with the cosmological constant @xmath3 . for the coordinates @xmath4 , as usual",
    ", one has @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and here we assume that the coordinates @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , are compactified to circles with the lengths @xmath9 : @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we consider the spatial topology @xmath12 .",
    "the compactification of a part of spatial coordinates reduces the symmetry of ds spacetime ( this is the case for minkowski spacetime as well ) . but",
    "this does not cause any problem from the cosmological point of view . from this perspective",
    "the geometry under consideration is just a special case of the larger class of spatially flat , kaluza - klein - type models which are relevant to inflationary cosmology .",
    "moreover , as it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "witt01 ( see also @xcite ) , there is every reason to doubt that quantum gravity effects are symmetric under the full ds group . in the discussion below it",
    "will be convenient , in addition to the time coordinate @xmath13 , to use the conformal time @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "for this coordinate the line element takes a conformally flat form with the conformal factor @xmath16 : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the minkowskian metric tensor .    though the spacetime under consideration is locally equivalent to the @xmath0-dimensional global ds spacetime with the spatial topology @xmath19 , the global properties of these manifolds are very different .",
    "the special case @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with all spatial dimensions been compactified and referred as spatially toral de sitter ( stds ) spacetime , has been previously discussed in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that the modification of the topology of ds spacetime leads to important physical consequences .",
    "unlike to the familiar ds spacetime , stds is geodesically incomplete in the past @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the planar coordinates do not cover the full ds manifold .",
    "it is known that ( see , for example , @xcite for a recent discussion ) this does not cause problems in the quantization of fields because @xmath22 defines a cauchy surface and the information from any part of ds manifold enters the submanifold covered by planar coordinates as an initial condition . as it has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , important physical differences of closed ds and stds spacetimes arise in the discussion of quantum creation of the universe . in a compact flat or open universe , unlike to the case of a closed or an infinite open universe , for the theories with the inflaton potential @xmath23 ( in planckian units ) the probability of inflation is not exponentially suppressed @xcite . for a closed ds universe , the effective potential @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the scale factor ) in the wheeler - dewitt equation contains a term proportional to @xmath26 which comes from the spatial curvature .",
    "this leads to the existence of the barrier in @xmath24 . in stds",
    "spacetime such a barrier is absent and there is no need for tunnelling through a classically forbidden region for the scale factor . in this case",
    "the cosmological evolution can begin with an arbitrarily small value of @xmath25 and there is no exponential suppression of the probability for quantum creation of the universe associated with tunnelling . in ref . @xcite it was argued that the pre- and post - inflationary distortions of the stds spacetime do not give rise to non - perturbative instabilities in string theory .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that there is no danger of seiberg - witten instability @xcite in toral string cosmology as long as conventional matter dominates in the post - inflationary evolution .",
    "this type of instability arises due to the emission of `` large branes '' .",
    "as it will be shown below , the nontrivial topology of the patch of ds spacetime covered by planar coordinates leads to another physical consequence , namely , to the appearance of nonzero vevs of the current density for charged fields .",
    "firstly , we consider a complex scalar field @xmath27 with a curvature coupling parameter @xmath28 , in the presence of a classical abelian gauge field @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding field equation has the form@xmath30where @xmath31 is the gauge - covariant derivative and @xmath32 is the coupling between the scalar and gauge fields . for the scalar curvature in ( [ fieldeq ] ) one",
    "has @xmath33 . in the most important special cases of minimally and conformally coupled scalars one has @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "since the background space is multiply - connected , in addition to the field equation one should specify the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions",
    ". we will assume generic quasiperiodic boundary condition@xmath36with constant phases @xmath37 and with @xmath38 being the unit vector along the dimension @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( for physical effects of phases in periodicity conditions for fields in multiply - connected spaces see also @xcite ) .",
    "the results below will be periodic functions of @xmath41 with the period equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the special cases of untwisted and twisted scalar fields ( periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions ) , most frequently discussed in the literature , correspond to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .    here",
    "we will consider the simplest configuration of the gauge field with @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", the gauge field can be excluded from the field equation by the gauge transformation @xmath46 in the new gauge one has @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "now the quasiperiodicity condition takes the form@xmath49where@xmath50as it is seen , the phases in the periodicity conditions and the value of the gauge field are related to each other through a gauge transformation . in what follows , the physical results will depend on the phases in the periodicity conditions and on the gauge potential in the form of the combination ( [ alf1 ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath51 is the spatial vector with @xmath52 components corresponding to the spacetime vector @xmath29 , then @xmath53 .",
    "although the corresponding field strength vanishes , a constant gauge field shifts the phases in the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions . as it will be seen below , this leads to the aharonov - bohm - like effects on the current density for charged fields .",
    "note that in ( [ alf1 ] ) the shift due to the gauge field may be written in the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the flux quantum and @xmath56 is the flux enclosed by the circle corresponding to the @xmath57th compact dimension . in",
    "what follows we will work in terms of the gauge transformed field @xmath58 omitting the prime .",

    "it can be seen that the general solution for the time - dependent part of the mode functions is a linear combination of the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74,@xmath75and the order of the hankel functions @xmath76 is related to the mass of the field by @xmath77 ^{1/2}.   \\label{nu}\\]]this parameter is either real and nonnegative or purely imaginary .",
    "an important step in formulating quantum field theory in a curved spacetime is the choice of vacuum .",
    "different choices of the coefficients in the linear combination of the hankel functions correspond to different choices of the vacuum state .",
    "ds spacetime has maximal symmetry and it is natural to choose a vacuum state having the same symmetry .",
    "it is well known that in ds spacetime there exists a one - parameter family of maximally symmetric vacuum states , which have been dubbed the @xmath78-vacua ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . among them",

    "in addition , we have assumed the presence of a constant classical abelian gauge filed .",
    "this leads to the aharonov - bohm - like effect on the current density .",
    "the physical quantities depend on the phases in the periodicity conditions and on the gauge potential in the form of the combination ( [ alf1 ] ) .",
    "the vevs of the charge density and of the components of the current density along compact dimensions vanish .    for the general case of toroidal spatial topology @xmath12 , the vevs for the scalar and fermionic current densities along the @xmath125th compact dimension",
    "are given by the expressions ( [ jscr ] ) and ( [ jrf2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "these vevs are even periodic functions of the phases @xmath215 , @xmath216 , with the period @xmath42 , and they are odd periodic functions of the phase @xmath133 with the same period . in particular , they exhibit aharonov - bohm - type oscillations as functions of the magnetic flux ( with the period of the flux quantum ) enclosed by the compact dimension . the current densities vanish in the special cases of untwisted and twisted fields , when the gauge field is absent .",
    "we have explicitly checked the transition to the minkowskian results , previously discussed in @xcite , in the limit @xmath217 , for a fixed value of @xmath156 . in this limit ,",
    "if the phases in the periodicity conditions and the masses for scalar and fermionic fields are the same , we have the simple relation ( [ jfjsc ] ) between the scalar and fermioinic current densities .",
    "in particular , in supersymmetric models on the background of the minkowski spacetime with equal number of scalar and fermionic degrees of freedom the total current density vanishes .",
    "the background gravitational field modifies the current densities for scalar and fermionic fields in different ways , and we have no similar cancellation in the ds spacetime .",
    "if the proper length of the compact dimension is much smaller than the ds curvature scale , the effects induced by gravity are small and the current densities are related to the corresponding results for massless fields in minkowski spacetime with compact dimensions by the simple formula @xmath218 . for a fixed value of the ratio @xmath219",
    ", this limit corresponds to the early stages of the cosmological expansion ( @xmath173 ) , and the current densities behave as @xmath220 .",
    "the effect of gravity on the vevs is decisive for proper lengths of the compact dimensions larger than the ds curvature radius . in this limit , for the case of a scalar field , depending on the mass ,",
    "two regimes are realized . for the first one , corresponding to real values of the parameter @xmath102 defined by ( [ nu ] ) , the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the current density is given by ( [ jsclate ] ) and the vevs decay monotonically as @xmath221 . for a fixed value of @xmath172",
    ", this corresponds to late stages of the cosmological evolution ( @xmath222 ) , and the current density is suppressed by the factor @xmath223 . in the second regime , realized for imaginary values of @xmath102 , the behavior of the scalar current density is oscillatory , with the amplitude decaying as @xmath224 .",
    "the period of oscillations is given by @xmath225 .",
    "for the fermionic field the oscillatory regime is realized only ( see ( [ jflate ] ) ) with the amplitude decaying as @xmath226 . in the fermionic case the period of oscillations",
    "does not depend on the curvature radius and is given by @xmath227 .",
    "note that the decay rates for the amplitude in the cases of the scalar and fermionic currents are different . at late stages of the cosmological expansion , the current densities are suppressed by the factors @xmath228 and @xmath220 for scalar and fermionic fields , respectively . for the values of the curvature scale @xmath229 ,",
    "if the length of the compact dimension is much larger than the compton wavelength of the field quanta , @xmath196 , the decay of the current densities as functions of @xmath194 is a power - law , for both scalar and fermionic fields .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the minkowski bulk , where the vevs of the current densities are suppressed exponentially .",
    "the effects we have discussed can be applied to two types of models . for",
    "the first one @xmath230 and the results given here describe how the properties of the universe are changed by one - loop quantum effects induced by the compactness of spatial dimensions . though the observational data constrain the size of possible compact dimensions to be larger than the horizon scale , at early stages of the cosmological expansion the lengths of compact dimensions were small and the effects considered here can be important .",
    "the second class of models , with @xmath200 and @xmath231 , correspond to the universe with kaluza - klein - type extra dimensions . in these models ,",
    "the current density along compact dimensions could be a source for cosmological magnetic fields .",
    "the gravitational analog of this electromagnetic effect was discussed in @xcite , where it was shown that the topological casimir energy can be considered as a possible origin for the dark energy .",
