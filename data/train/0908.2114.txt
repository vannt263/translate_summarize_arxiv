    "the skyrme model is a nonlinear @xmath0 field theory which gives a good description of atomic nuclei and their low energy interactions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental pion excitations the theory also has topological soliton solutions , known as skyrmions .",
    "these are labelled by a topological charge or generalised winding number @xmath1 , which can be interpreted as the baryon number of the configuration .",
    "on quantization , skyrmions are found to describe nuclei , @xmath2-resonance @xcite and also bound states of nuclei , see @xcite for the quantization of multi - skyrmions and @xcite for recent quantitative predictions of the skyrme model .",
    "it is well known that skyrmions can be quantized as fermions @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the skyrme field is coupled to a fermion field , there are two different ways of describing fermions in the same model . the fermion field",
    "can then be thought of as light quarks in the presence of atomic nuclei , @xcite . in the presence of a skyrme field",
    "the energy spectrum of the dirac operator shows a curious behaviour , namely , a mode crosses from the positive to the negative spectrum as the coupling constant is increased , @xcite . in a very similar model , kahana and ripka",
    "calculate the baryon density in the one - loop approximation @xcite and the energy of the dirac sea quarks @xcite .",
    "recently , these calculations have been extended to multi - skyrmions , @xcite .",
    "static field configurations in the original skyrme model in flat space are given by maps @xmath3 . by using the boundary condition for the skyrme field to unify the domain of such a map with infinity we make the domain compact and equivalent to the 3-sphere @xmath4 .",
    "if we also consider that @xmath4 is the group manifold of @xmath0 , we can see that the field configurations are topologically equivalent to maps @xmath5 and , because of this , the model can be generalized to the base space being a sphere of radius @xmath6 , @xcite . in the limit @xmath7 , the original model is recovered .",
    "the advantage of working on @xmath8 is that the bogomolnyi equation can be solved for @xmath9 and the solution is given by the identity map @xcite .",
    "this enables us to calculate the energy spectrum and the corresponding fermion wave functions explicitly .    in @xcite a system of light fermions , on @xmath4 , coupled to a spherically symmetric background skyrme field",

    "we consider the general case where the grand spin also takes positive integer values . the dirac equation on @xmath8",
    "is derived in section [ dirac ] through the use of stereographic coordinates . in section [ g=0 ] , the solution of the dirac equation for @xmath10 is reviewed . in section [ g ] , the correct ansatz for the spin - isospin spinor for general @xmath11 is deduced using parity arguments .",

    "is then computed and matrix components are compared .    substituting ( [ psi ] ) into ( [ schreq ] ) and using the identities ( [ emusigma1 ] ) , ( [ emusigma2 ] ) , ( [ 2ls1])-([2ls4 ] ) and ( [ emutau1])-([emutau4 ] )",
    "we are led to two equations , one in @xmath105 and @xmath106 and one in @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we equate coefficients of the @xmath11-eigenstates to obtain four odes in @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "these odes are shown below ,    @xmath146    these equation give the solutions for states with parity @xmath104 . due to",
    "the symmetry ( [ gsym ] ) states with parity @xmath147 are obtained by replacing @xmath46 by @xmath148 in the equations above .      in this section",
    ", we derive the energy spectrum of the time - independent dirac equation ( [ schreq ] ) and the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "we discuss a useful symmetry of our system of equations ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) and also comment on associated second order and fourth order equations . in order to derive the spectrum",
    ", we use the theory of fuchsian differential equations , and in particular , regular singular points and their exponents , see @xcite . finally , we present the explicit solution .    under the transformation @xmath149 followed by @xmath150 ( [ dg2du ] )",
    "is mapped into ( [ dg4du ] ) and ( [ dg1du ] ) into ( [ dg3du ] ) , and vice versa .",
    "hence the system of equations ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) remains invariant .",
    "eliminating @xmath112 and @xmath114 from the system ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) results in a system of two second order equations , which again map into each other via the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "these second order equations prove to be useful for deriving an ansatz for @xmath113 and @xmath151 finally , we can also derive two fourth order odes , by eliminating @xmath115 and @xmath113 , respectively , again related via ( [ sym ] ) . hence , if we have solutions for @xmath113 we can find solutions for @xmath115 .",
    "we can then use our system of first order odes to find solutions for @xmath112 and @xmath114 .    in order to solve our equations",
    "we first have to derive the energy eigenvalues .",
    "our system of equations ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) has regular singular points at @xmath77 and an irregular singular point at infinity . for both regular singular points",
    "the exponents are @xmath152 we require our solutions to be regular over the whole 3-sphere and , in particular , at the north and south poles , @xmath77 .",
    "the solutions corresponding to the exponents @xmath153 and @xmath154 contain poles , so we can exclude these solutions .",
    "the fact that there are two exponents taking values of zero means that corresponding to each regular singular point is a solution with logarithmic terms and the solution is therefore singular . as a result",
    ", we can also exclude these solutions .",
    "the regular solution can therefore be expanded as a power series in @xmath155 around the south pole , and also a power series in @xmath156 around the north pole .",
    "these two expansions only agree for certain values of the energy @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that these energy eigenvalues can be calculated from the exponents at infinity of the fourth order ode in @xmath113 , mentioned above , which arises by eliminating @xmath157 @xmath158 and @xmath115 from our system of equations ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) .",
    "this equation is of fuchsian type and has three regular singular points at @xmath77 and infinity .",
    "the solutions of fuchsian differential equations can only have singularities at their singular points . according to our discussion above , we are interested in the solutions of ( [ schreq ] ) which are non - singular .",
    "therefore , @xmath113 has to be regular at @xmath77 , and hence on the entire complex plane .",
    "so , @xmath113 is an analytic function , in fact an integral function , on the complex plane .",
    "as it is the solution of a fuchsian differential equation , it can only have poles at infinity , and it follows that @xmath113 is a polynomial .",
    "the exponents corresponding to @xmath159 can be found by setting @xmath160 then considering @xmath161 .",
    "we obtain the exponents @xmath162    as argued above @xmath113 is a polynomial .",
    "let its degree be denoted by @xmath163 then the exponents at @xmath159 can be equated with @xmath164 . from the exponent @xmath165",
    "we obtain the following energy eigenvalues @xmath166 @xmath167 is a novel feature which arises for @xmath168 only . note that this energy is invariant under @xmath169 . from @xmath170 in ( [ rhoa ] )",
    "we obtain another family of energy eigenvalues , namely , @xmath171 where @xmath11 and @xmath172 are not both zero .",
    "this energy spectrum has already been obtained in @xcite for the case @xmath173 a slight subtlety occurs for @xmath174 and @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", only @xmath175 leads to a regular solution .",
    "the energy level ( [ e0 ] ) is rather special as it crosses from the positive spectrum to the negative spectrum as the coupling constant @xmath46 is varied , also see @xcite for further details .",
    "now that we have derived the energy spectrum , we can solve the system ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) by first considering the fourth order ode in @xmath113 .",
    "we make the ansatz that @xmath113 is a polynomial in @xmath155 and insert this into our ode to find the polynomial coefficients . the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) and the system of second order equations for @xmath113 and @xmath115 leads to a related expression for @xmath115 .",
    "then the solution corresponding to @xmath176 is found to be @xmath177 the general expression for @xmath86 is @xmath178 if we set @xmath10 , and hence @xmath179 , the above formula leads us to ( [ aj3 ] ) which is equivalent to the result from @xcite .    for @xmath180",
    "we find @xmath181 the general expression for @xmath86 is now @xmath182 we then use equations ( [ dg4du ] ) and ( [ dg2du ] ) to obtain @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively , and it is easy to see that @xmath112 and @xmath114 are polynomials of order @xmath185    we can carry out a consistency check on our solutions by setting @xmath186 in equations ( [ dg1du])-([dg4du ] ) and manipulating the equations to obtain two uncoupled second order odes .",
    "these are both jacobi equations and have polynomial solutions which can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath186 ,",
    "our solutions are the same .      in order to discuss the degeneracy of the energy spectrum it is convenient to introduce @xmath187 , where the integer @xmath188 is analogous to the principal quantum number arising in the quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom .",
    "then the energy spectrum for states of parity @xmath104 is given by the two families @xmath189 and the special energy level ( [ e0 ] ) , @xmath190 figure [ energy ] shows the energy spectra for different values of @xmath188 .",
    "there are two different ways of reading figure [ energy ] .",
    "the obvious interpretation is the energy spectrum of states of parity @xmath104 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath191 for the second interpretation and in the following , we restrict our attention to @xmath192 .",
    "then , the negative values of @xmath46 corresponds to states with parity @xmath147 due to symmetry ( [ gsym ] ) , while positive values of @xmath46 again correspond to states of parity @xmath193 the latter interpretation is very useful for discussing the degeneracy of the spectrum .    spectrum.eps    the energy level ( [ e0 ] ) only exists for @xmath10 .",
    "it gives rise to a positive parity state with energy @xmath194 and a negative parity state with energy @xmath195 since the degeneracy of a state with grand spin @xmath11 is @xmath196 these two states are non - degenerate for @xmath197 and `` parity doubling '' occurs for @xmath186 , @xcite .    for @xmath198 positive and negative parity states will in general have different energy eigenvalues for a given value of the coupling constant @xmath46 . recall that @xmath187 , hence @xmath11 can vary from @xmath199 to @xmath200 therefore , the degeneracy is @xmath201    for @xmath202 positive and negative parity states have the same energy for a given value of the coupling constant @xmath203 these states only exist for @xmath204 , hence @xmath11 varies from @xmath205 to @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy is @xmath206 and the extra factor of @xmath207 is due to parity .",
    "we now consider the case of zero coupling ( @xmath186 ) which is equivalent to massless fermions on @xmath8 . in this case",
    "there will clearly always be invariance under @xmath208 , so    @xmath209    at @xmath210 the energy level @xmath211 and @xmath212 are degenerate , hence the degeneracy is @xmath213 the energy eigenvalue @xmath214 only occurs for @xmath215 , hence the degeneracy is again @xmath216    the energy eigenvalue @xmath217 @xmath218 , @xmath207 ,  ,",
    "is attained by @xmath219 and @xmath220 hence @xmath221 similarly , @xmath222 is attained by @xmath223 and @xmath224 hence @xmath225 after considering the factor of @xmath207 due to isospin and another factor of @xmath207 due to parity , equations ( [ deg0a ] ) and ( [ deg0b ] ) are consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only considered generic degeneracies and the case @xmath226 this energy spectrum is rather special in that we can also calculate all the accidental degeneracies for @xmath227 .",
    "these degeneracies all occur for rational values of @xmath203 for example , the negative parity state with energy @xmath228 is only degenerate with the states with @xmath229 for @xmath230 and with the @xmath147 parity states with @xmath231 (",
    "changing @xmath46 to @xmath148 ) for @xmath232 the positive parity state with energy @xmath233 is always non - degenerate for @xmath234 similarly , @xmath104 parity states of energy @xmath235 are degenerate with @xmath147 parity states of energy @xmath236 for @xmath237 which is positive for @xmath238 .",
    "finally , states with energy @xmath239 and states with energy @xmath240 are degenerate for @xmath241 and a similar equation holds for @xmath231 and @xmath242",
    "in this section , we briefly comment on the zeta function regularization @xcite . in order to calculate the energy of the dirac sea ,",
    "@xmath243 where @xmath244 is the @xmath13th negative energy eigenvalue , see e.g. @xcite , and @xmath245 is its degeneracy , we define the zeta function @xmath246 the expression ( [ naive ] ) is clearly divergent . however , the expression ( [ zeta ] ) is convergent for large enough @xmath247 .",
    "the dirac sea energy ( [ naive ] ) is then defined by the analytic continuation of ( [ zeta ] ) to @xmath248 .",
    "for example for @xmath186 we have @xmath249 hence , the relevant zeta function is @xmath250 which can be rewritten as @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the hurwitz zeta function defined as @xmath253 evaluating @xmath254 at @xmath248 we obtain @xmath255    for massive fermions on @xmath8 corresponding to the case @xmath72 in section [ g=0 ] , the energy is given by ( [ ef=0 ] ) and the degeneracy is @xmath256 hence the dirac sea energy is given by @xmath257 zeta functions of generalized epstein - hurwitz type are of the form @xmath258 asymptotic expansions for ( [ fsab ] ) are discussed in @xcite . here , we are concerned with a generalization of ( [ fsab ] ) , namely , @xmath259 where we assume that @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "we follow @xcite to derive a formula for @xmath262 we first perform a binomial expansion which is valid for @xmath263 and rewrite ( [ fmsab ] ) as a contour integral @xmath264 recall that @xmath265 the contour @xmath266 encloses all the non - negative poles of @xmath267 with anti - clockwise orientation and can be split into a part @xmath268 where @xmath269 and a semi - circle at infinity .",
    "the latter does not contribute to the integral .",
    "now , we can move the sum over @xmath188 under the integral and use the definition of the hurwitz zeta function ( [ zetah ] ) to obtain @xmath270 this can be evaluated by closing the contour again , and using cauchy s theorem .",
    "this time the contribution of the integral over the semi - circle at infinity is non - zero .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the contribution is very small , so we neglect it in the following .    from now on",
    ", we focus on the physically relevant value @xmath271 .",
    "the integral ( [ fint ] ) has poles at @xmath272 due to @xmath273 . only the non - negative poles contribute , because of the contour .",
    "the gamma function @xmath274 has poles at @xmath275 only the pole at @xmath276 lies inside the contour . finally , there is a contribution from the pole of the hurwitz zeta function at @xmath277 all the poles are simple unless the pole of @xmath278 at @xmath279 is a non - negative integer .",
    "hence , the integral in ( [ fint ] ) becomes    @xmath280    where the sum arises from the simple poles of @xmath281 note that @xmath282 and @xmath283 where @xmath284 are the bernoulli polynomials and @xmath285 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",

    "the dirac sea energy is given by    @xmath297    which is the sum of @xmath298 and @xmath299 for both parities .",
    "the energy of the `` zero mode '' @xmath300 also needs to be taken into account , and we expect a similar picture as in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this is a much more complicated situation , and zeta functions of this type have not been discussed in the literature , to our knowledge . as a starting point , we could again perform a binomial expansion .",
    "we can then rewrite the energy @xmath301 as an infinite sum of zeta functions @xmath302 .",
    "unfortunately , the last term in ( [ ezetaf = mu ] ) leads to @xmath303 which is negative for small @xmath46 , and our formula no longer converges . it would be interesting to derive alternative expressions for these types of zeta function",
    "in this paper we consider the dirac equation for fermions on @xmath4 chirally coupled to a spherically - symmetric background skyrmion with topological charge one .",
    "the time - independent dirac equation commutes with the grand spin and parity , and these symmetries allow us to reduce the dirac equation to a system of four linear odes . making use of the theory of fuchsian differential equations ,",
    "we derive the complete energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions which are given by polynomials .",
    "there is a positive parity state with energy @xmath304 and a negative parity state with energy @xmath305 both states are generally non - degenerate .",
    "the energies @xmath306 and @xmath307 all have degeneracy @xmath308 , and correspond to states with parity @xmath104 and @xmath309 respectively . for @xmath310 these energies",
    "were found in @xcite . finally , the energies @xmath311 have degeneracy @xmath312 the factor of @xmath207 arises because the energy of these states is independent of parity .",
    "furthermore , these states only occur for @xmath313    for zero coupling ( @xmath186 ) the energy spectrum is @xmath314 and the degeneracy was found to be @xmath315 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we also found explicit formulae for accidental degeneracies which occur for special values of the coupling constant @xmath203    the explicit formulae for the energy spectrum and its degeneracy enabled us to write down the zeta function related to the dirac sea . for massive fermions on @xmath8 , we were able to derive an asymptotic formula for a zeta function of generalized epstein - hurwitz type .",
    "the more interesting case of fermions coupled to skyrmions on @xmath8 leads to an interesting novel type of zeta function . however , we were unable to evaluate it using our current approach .",
    "this is an interesting topic for further study .",
    "the authors would like to thank n s manton for fruitful discussions .",
