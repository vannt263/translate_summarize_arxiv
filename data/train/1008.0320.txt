    "it has been just over thirty years since @xcite and @xcite showed how passing gravitational waves cause disturbances in pulsar pulse arrival times that could be used to detect or limit gravitational wave signal strength , and twenty years since @xcite proposed using correlated timing residuals of a collection of pulsars  i.e. , a _ pulsar timing array _ ( pta )  to achieve greater sensitivity .",
    "thought of as a gravitational wave detector a pta is large : its size @xmath1 ( on order kpc ) is much greater than the gravitational radiation wavelength scale @xmath2 ( on order pc ) that we use it to probe .",
    "the conventional approximation of gravitational waves as plane - fronted applies only for sources at distances @xmath4 : for less distant sources the curvature of the gravitational radiation phasefronts contribute significantly to the detector response . here",
    "we evaluate the response of a pta to discrete gravitational wave sources at distances close enough that gravitational wave phasefront curvature is important and describe how pta observations of such sources may be used to measure the source distance and location on the sky .    pulsar timing currently provides the best observational evidence for gravitational waves : as of this writing the orbital decay of the binary pulsar system psr  b@xmath5 , induced by gravitational wave emission and measured by timing measurements , is the most conclusive observational evidence for gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this evidence is often described , without any intent of disparagement , as _ indirect _ since it is the effect of gravitational wave _ emission _  i.e. , the effect of the emission on the emitter  that is observed .",
    "the effect of the gravitational radiation , independent of its source , on another system  a _ detector _  itself remains to be observed .",
    "as proposed by @xcite and @xcite precision pulsar timing can also be used to detect gravitational waves _ directly .",
    "_ gravitational waves passing between the pulsar and earth i.e. , temporal variations in the space - time curvature along the pulsar - earth null geodesics  change the time required by successive pulses to travel the path from pulsar to earth .",
    "since successive pulses are emitted from the pulsar at regular intervals the effect of passing gravitational waves are apparent as irregularities in the observed pulse arrival times . through the use of precision timing a collection of especially stable pulsars",
    "may thus be turned into a galactic scale gravitational wave detector .",
    "timing of individual pulsars has been used to bound the gravitational wave power associated with stochastic gravitational waves of cosmological origin @xcite ; timing residual correlations among pulsar pairs have been used to bound the power in an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite ; the absence of evidence for gravitational waves in the timing of a single pulsar has been used to rule - out the presence of a proposed supermassive black hole binary in 3c  66b @xcite ; observations from multiple pulsars have been used to place limits on periodic gravitational waves from sag  @xmath6 @xcite ; and timing analyses of individual pulsars have been combined to place a sky - averaged constraint on the merger rate of nearby black - hole binaries in the early phases of coalescence @xcite .",
    "additionally , analyses of pulsar timing data have been proposed to search for the gravitational wave `` memory '' effect @xcite and more general gravitational wave bursts @xcite , which might be generated during , e.g. , the periapsis passage of a highly eccentric binary system @xcite or by cosmic string cusps or kinks @xcite .",
    "analyses focused on discovering or bounding the intensity of a stochastic gravitational wave `` background '' may rightly resolve the radiation into a superposition of plane waves with density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gravitational wave strain and @xmath9 denotes a plane wave component at frequency @xmath10 and propagating in direction @xmath11 .",
    "analyses focused on the discovery of gravitational wave point sources  e.g. , supermassive black hole binaries  must take proper account of the curvature of the radiation phase - front , owing to the finite distance between the source and the detector , over the detector s extent .",
    "when detector extent , measured in units of the radiation wavelength , is greater than the distance to the source , measured in units of detector extent , then curvature of the radiation wavefront over the detector contributes significantly to the detector response to the incident radiation .    in  [ sec : resp ] we evaluate the pulse arrive - time disturbance associated with a spherically - fronted gravitational wave traversing a pulsar - earth line - of - sight and compare it with the response to the same wave in the plane - wave approximation . in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we describe how , owing to their sensitivity to gravitational radiation phasefront curvature , pta observations of point sources can be used to measure or place lower bounds on the distance to the source distance and , more surprisingly , the distance to the array pulsars .",

    "the fourier amplitude and phase of the gravitational wave timing residual @xmath52 for any particular pulsar depends on the pulsar s position and distance relative to the position and distance of the gravitational wave source .",
    "correspondingly , observation in three or more pulsars of the gravitational wave timing residuals associated with a single source can , in principle , be used to infer the three - dimensional source position and location on the sky . in this section",

    "in order to relate the angular location of a gravitational wave source to the relative amplitude and phase of the @xmath53 for two or more pta pulsars the uncertainties @xmath55 in the earth - pulsar distances , and @xmath56 in pulsar sky locations , must satisfy    [ eq : sigmalt ] @xmath57    the constraint on pulsar angular position accuracy is not a severe one ; however , the constraint on pulsar distance accuracy is quite significant . for this reason",
    "previous pulsar timing searches for periodic gravitational waves @xcite have sought only to identify an anomalous periodic contribution to pulse arrival times , avoiding explicit use of the amplitude of @xmath54 .",
    "improvements in instrumentation and timing techniques are making possible pulsar distance measurements of the accuracy and precision necessary to relate the @xmath53 to the gravitational wave source angular location .",
    "for example , in recent years a succession of vlbi observations have established the distance to j@xmath58 with an accuracy of @xmath59 @xcite ; correspondingly , for j@xmath58 predictions of the amplitude and phase of @xmath53 can be made and take part in the analysis of timing data to search for gravitational waves at frequencies @xmath60 .",
    "accurate pulsar distance measurements have been identified as a crucial element of a continuing program to use precision pulsar timing and interferometry to test gravity and measure neutron star properties @xcite ; correspondingly , we can reasonably expect that the number of pulsars with high - precision distances will increase rapidly over the next several years .",
    "looking toward the future , observations with the ska @xcite using existing timing techniques are expected to be capable of measuring timing parallax distances to millisecond pulsars at 20  kpc with an accuracy of 20% @xcite .",
    "when measured by vlbi or timing parallax the fractional uncertainty in the pulsar distance is equal to the fractional uncertainty in the semi - annual pulse arrival time variation owing to the curvature of the pulsar s electromagnetic phasefronts : i.e. ,    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the timing noise power in the bandwidth @xmath63 ( for @xmath64 the observation duration ) about a frequency of @xmath65 and @xmath66    is the peak - to - peak variation in the pulse arrival time residual owing to the curvature of the pulsar s electromagnetic phasefronts .",
    "correspondingly , a 20% accuracy measurement of the distance to a pulsar at 20  kpc corresponds to an 0.5% accuracy measurement of the distance to a pulsar of the @xmath67 at 500  pc : i.e. , 2.5  pc .",
    "this estimate of @xmath68  pc for a pulsar at 500  pc assumes constant signal - to - noise and , correspondingly , constant timing precision @xmath67 .",
    "closer pulsars will have greater fluxes and , correspondingly , better timing precision ; consequently we may regard this as an upper bound on the distance measurement error @xmath55 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath69 is proportional to the pulsar energy flux then    [ eq : sigmal ] @xmath70    i.e. , if the only barrier to improved timing precision is signal - to - noise then sub - parsec precision distance measurements should be possible in the ska era for pulsars within a kpc .    in practice other contributions to the noise budget will eventually limit the timing precision . among these",
    "the most important are intrinsic pulsar timing noise , pulse broadening owing to scattering in the ism , tropospheric scintillation .",
    "recent improvements in pulsar timing techniques @xcite suggest that intrinsic pulsar timing noise need not limit timing precision measurements in either present or future instrumentation .",
    "unresolved pulse broadening owing to scattering in the ism will limit the attainable @xmath67 and , thus , @xmath55 . for nearby ( @xmath71  kpc ) pulsars the _ measured _ pulse broadening at @xmath72  ghz is typically in the 110  ns range @xcite . since pulse broadening is scales with observation frequency as @xmath73 (",
    "though observations suggest the index may be closer to @xmath74 @xcite ) scattering in the ism also need not limit our ability to measure the distance to nearby pulsars .",
    "finally , recent estimates by @xcite indicate that , for gravitational wave frequencies @xmath75 , tropospheric scintillation will contribute to the noise budget at no more than the 0.03  ns rms level .",
    "consequently , over the next decade @xmath76 is thus a reasonable expectation for millisecond pulsars at distances up to a kpc .",

    "the baselines over which the parallax is measured are , in this case , the timing array pulsar - earth baselines .",
    "crucial to the ability to observe the effects of gravitational wave phasefront curvature is a knowledge of the pulsar - earth distance @xmath1 with an uncertainty @xmath114 .",
    "we argue that pulsar distance measurements of this accuracy , while beyond present capabilities ( except in the case of j@xmath58 , which is exceptionally bright and close ) , are within the capability of ska - era observations for pulsars at distances @xmath115 .",
    "when considered against the cosmic distance ladder , the distance measurement described here involves three rungs to reach distances greater than tens of mpc : first , the determination of the astronomical unit ; second , the distance to the array pulsars ; finally , the distance to the gravitational wave source . since the method described here also provides precise source angular position the likelihood of identifying an electromagnetic counterpart ( e.g. , host galaxy ) to the gravitational wave source is great , raising the possibility of a precise measurement of both the redshift and luminosity distance to a single object at cosmological distances , with the obvious consequences for independent verification of the parameters describing our expanding universe .    even in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart measurement of the luminosity distance and angular location of a supermassive black hole binary system  the most likely source of periodic gravitational waves  enables the determination of the system s so - called  chirp mass  , or @xmath116 , without the need to observe the binary s evolution .    we have only begun to plumb the potential of gravitational wave observations as a tool of astronomical discovery .",
