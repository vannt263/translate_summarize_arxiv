    "the strong couplings among the spin , lattice and charge degrees of freedom in transition - metal oxides ( tmo ) are essentially mediated by the orbital degree of freedom ( odf ) , which plays a crucial role in controlling the phases and various physical properties  @xcite .",

    "the low - energy optical excitations below the strong o @xmath4 to transition - metal @xmath5 charge - transfer peak mostly come from the transition - metal @xmath5-to-@xmath5 transitions .",
    "those transitions reflect sensitively the spin and orbital structures of the system through optical transition matrix elements , and show anisotropy when spin and orbital are cooperatively ordered  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the proper analysis of experimental anisotropic optical spectra requires the detailed understanding of electronic and magnetic structures .",
    "both lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 are insulators with a @xmath6 orthorhombic unit cell with @xmath7 at room temperature .",
    "there are two @xmath5 electrons per v@xmath8 site .",
    "synchrotron x - ray and neutron diffraction results  @xcite suggested that lavo@xmath2 undergoes a magnetic phase transition at 143k  @xcite and a structural phase transition at 140k .",
    "the low temperature phase has the c - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin configuration ( _ i.e. _ , ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling along the @xmath9-axis and af coupling in the @xmath10-plane ) . due to the jahn - teller distortion , one of the v - o bond is longer than other two in the vo@xmath11 octahedron .",
    "the longer bond lies in the @xmath10-plane and its orientation alternates for the neighboring v sites in the plane .",
    "the stacking of the longer bonds also alternates along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "hereafter we call this kind of distortion the g - type jahn - teller distortion .",
    "this low temperature phase has p2@xmath12/@xmath13 crystal symmetry .",
    "the structural and magnetic phases for yvo@xmath2 are quite complicated  @xcite . with lowering the temperature ,",
    "this compound first undergoes a structural phase transition at 200k from a disordered phase to the g - type jahn - teller distorted structure , the same structure as the low temperature phase of lavo@xmath2 .",
    "then the c - type af ordering develops at 116 k ( @xmath14 ) . with further lowering the temperature to 77k ( @xmath15 )",
    ", another structural and magnetic phase appears . the low temperature ( @xmath1677k ) phase recovers the @xmath6 crystal symmetry with the c - type jahn - teller distortion ( _ i.e. _ , the longer bonds stack along the @xmath9-axis in the same orientation rather than alternately ) .",
    "the magnetic structure of this low temperature phase is g - type af structure ( _ i.e. _ , af coupling both in the @xmath10-plane and along the @xmath9-axis ) .",
    "strong temperature - induced magnetization reversal can be observed at @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "sawada and terakura studied the electronic and magnetic structures of lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 by using the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method .",
    "they first compared the results  @xcite between lda ( local density approximation ) and gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) , and then applied the lda+@xmath1 method  @xcite to lavo@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "they found that the lda and gga are not sufficient , and lda+@xmath1 is necessary in order to predict the low temperature phase correctly .",
    "recently , the polarized optical conductivities of lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 were measured by miyasaka et al .",
    "@xcite and very clear anisotropy was observed . to understand the implications of those spectra",
    ", we developed the plane - wave pseudopotential method based on lda+@xmath1 to calculate the optical conductivity and studied the effects of spin and orbital orderings on the anisotropy .",
    "the experimental spectra of both lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 at low temperature can be qualitatively explained by our calculations , while the studies for the intermediate temperature phase ( @xmath17 ) for yvo@xmath2 suggest the complication of magnetic and orbital structures . in section",
    "ii of this paper , we will describe our method , and the results are discussed in section iii .",
    "the vanderbilt type ultra - soft pseudopotential  @xcite is useful not only for efficient calculations for transition - metal oxides but also for implementing the lda+@xmath1 method to treat effects of strong correlation . in the lda+@xmath1 method , the strong coulomb interaction is explicitly taken into account in the subspace of localized orbitals through a harteree - like scheme .",
    "the detailed description of our lda+@xmath1 scheme was given in ref .",
    "the inter - band optical conductivity is calculated from the converged kohn - sham wave functions @xmath18 and eigen values @xmath19 by using the following kubo formula  @xcite ( in ry units ) :    @xmath20\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\omega ) & = & -\\frac{16}{v}\\sum_{\\bf k\\it n}if_{n\\bf k}\\sum_{m } \\frac{1}{\\omega_{mn}^2-(\\omega+i\\delta)^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\frac{\\omega+i\\delta}{\\omega_{mn } } re(\\pi_{nm}^\\alpha\\pi_{mn}^\\beta)+iim(\\pi_{nm}^\\alpha\\pi_{mn}^\\beta ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( = @xmath23 ) are indices for directions , @xmath24 is the excitation energy , @xmath25 is the volume of the unit cell , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are band indices , @xmath28 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the lifetime broadening ( @xmath30=0.01ry in this work ) , @xmath31 are the matrix elements of the momentum operator .",
    "the calculations for the matrix elements @xmath32 require the all electron wave - functions @xmath33 , which can be obtained from the following core compensation form  @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 are the pseudo - wave - functions obtained from the self - consistent pseudopotential calculations , @xmath36 is the index for atomic orbitals , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are atomic all - electron and pseudo- wave functions respectively , @xmath39 are the localized functions as defined in ref .",
    "[ ] . therefore , the matrix elements of momentum operator can be obtained as  @xcite :    @xmath40    practically , the core contribution ( second term of eq.(3 ) ) can be calculated in the pseudopotential generation process and stored as input of self - consistent calculations .",
    "the present process has been well checked by using lamno@xmath2 as an example  @xcite . throughout the calculations",
    ", 30ry has been used for the cutoff energy of plane - wave expansion , and we use @xmath41 mesh for the k - points in the linear tetrahedron method with the curvature correction .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 in lda+@xmath1 scheme is chosen to be about 3.0ev in order to reproduce the experimental band gaps  @xcite .",
    "the unit cell and coordinates are defined in fig.1 .",
    "four v atoms , say v-1 , v-2 , v-3 and v-4 , are included in the unit cell . following the common convention , we defined the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions as the [ 110 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] directions of the unit cell respectively .",
    "three structures , lavo@xmath2 at 10k  @xcite , yvo@xmath2 at 65k  @xcite , and yvo@xmath2 at 100k  @xcite are treated here , which have the g - type , c - type and g - type jahn - teller distortions , respectively . for each fixed structure , relative stability is studied among four kinds of collinear magnetic structures : c - type af , g - type af , a - type af(_i.e .",
    "_ , fm layers coupled antiferromagneticaly along the @xmath9-axis ) , and fm spin ordering ( so ) states .",
    "each of the above jahn - teller distortions is accompanied by the same type of orbital ordering ( oo ) and stabilizes a specific related magnetic structure . in the present case",
    ", our calculations suggest that the g - type and c - type oo favor the c - type and g - type af so , respectively .",
    "this result is consistent with experimental observations and also with the previous calculations  @xcite and unrestricted hartree - fock studies  @xcite .",
    "now we concentrate on the discussion for the electronic structures of the lowest energy magnetic state of each structure .",
    "they are a ) lavo@xmath2 10k with g - oo and c - so ; b ) yvo@xmath2 65k with c - oo and g - so ; c ) yvo@xmath2 100k with g - oo and c - so .",
    "the obtained magnetic moments for these three states are all about 1.7@xmath46/v .",
    "the calculated electronic projected densities of states ( pdos ) are summarized in fig.2 , where different orbitals are shown by different colors .",
    "the o-@xmath4 and v-@xmath47 states are not plotted .    for a ) , the occupied electronic configuration can be nominally expressed as v-1 : @xmath48 ; v-2 : @xmath49 ; v-3 : @xmath50 ; v-4 : @xmath51 .",
    "one of the two electrons on each v site will occupy the @xmath52 orbital , and another electron will occupy the @xmath53 or @xmath54 orbital alternately from one v atom to its neighboring v atoms , resulting in g - oo .",
    "the c - so is manifested as the up spin state for v-1 and v-3 , and the down spin state for v-2 and v-4 .",
    "due to deviation from the cubic structure , certain degree of mixture of orbitals can be observed : for example , the small occupation of @xmath55 orbital ( green line ) for v-1 site .",
    "note here that , in our calculation , for each fixed structure and spin configuration the orbital polarization is fully relaxed self - consistently .",
    "the calculated electronic and magnetic structures of yvo@xmath2 in the intermediate temperature ( 100k ) phase ( panel c in fig.2 ) can be understood in the same way as the low temperature phase of lavo@xmath2 in terms of the same spin and orbital orderings .",
    "this can be seen from the similarity of the panel a ) to the panel c ) in fig.2 .    for the low temperature phase of yvo@xmath2 ( panel b in fig.2 )",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "the nominal electronic occupations can be understood as v-1 : @xmath48 ; v-2 : @xmath49 ; v-3 : @xmath51 ; v-4 : @xmath50 . as for the oo and so in the @xmath10-plane ,",
    "the present situation is the same as those of a ) and c ) .",
    "however , the oo and so along the @xmath9-axis are different . in the present case ,",
    "all the v atoms along a given @xmath9-axis have the same orbital occupation , while those belonging to the nearest neighbor @xmath9-axes have different orbital occupations .",
    "for instance , the @xmath53 orbital is occupied for both v-1 and v-3 sites . this c-",
    "oo leads to stability of the g - so through af superexchange . comparing lavo@xmath2 with yvo@xmath2",
    ", we can find strong mixture of orbitals in yvo@xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the enhanced structural distortion in yvo@xmath2 compared with lavo@xmath2 .",
    "the v - o - v angles are about 157 degrees in lavo@xmath2 , while they are reduced to about 144 degrees in yvo@xmath2 .",
    "similar analysis was made for all other magnetic phases of these three structures . among several results",
    "obtained , we noticed the following interesting and possibly important feature : for a fixed crystal structure , a change in the magnetic structure will not cause any significant change in the orbital ordering .",
    "it is likely that the orbital structure is mostly determined by the specific structure distortion in the present case .",
    "the results for optical conductivity are summarized in fig.3 .",
    "experimentally , two peak structures ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are observed for e//@xmath9 in both compounds , with peak @xmath22 located at higher energy than peak @xmath21 .",
    "for lavo@xmath2 , peak @xmath21 has a very sharp structure at low temperature and is significantly suppressed above the transition temperature .",
    "peak @xmath22 is quite weak and almost temperature independent . in yvo@xmath2 , on the other hand , peak @xmath22 has a larger weight with strong temperature dependence and peak @xmath21 is weak with only little temperature dependence . for both lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 ,",
    "the e//@xmath13 spectra are quite broad and almost temperature insensitive .      for lavo@xmath2 at 10k , the g - oo with c",
    "- so state is the most stable state .",
    "we first analyze the case of e//@xmath9 , where we consider the inter - site transition between v-1 and v-3 as the transition dipole is along the @xmath9-axis . the calculated optical conductivity for c - af in fig.3 shows clearly a sharp peak corresponding to the experimental peak @xmath21 .",
    "looking back to the calculated pdos in fig.2 , and taking the transitions from v-1 site to other sites as examples , we can assign the sharp peak @xmath21 for e//@xmath9 to the transition from v-1-@xmath56 to v-3-@xmath56 as denoted by the solid red arrow in fig.2 .",
    "this transition is not allowed if the magnetic structure along @xmath9-axis is af , like in the g - af and a - af states , where no peak is obtained around the same position of peak @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the peak @xmath21 should be suppressed above the magnetic transition temperature as observed in experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "peak @xmath22 seen in experiment does not exist in the calculated spectra for c - af .",
    "since the spectral weight of peak @xmath22 is very small and temperature insensitive in experiment , we speculate that this peak may come from certain component of imperfect spin ordering along the @xmath9-axis . for example , let us reverse the spin of v-3 site in fig.2a .",
    "the transition from v-1-@xmath56 to v-3-@xmath56 located at higher energy ( denoted by the red dashed arrows in fig.2 ) will be allowed and contribute to a sharp peak near the position of peak @xmath22 , as shown in the spectra for the g - af and a - af state for e//@xmath9 . before moving to yvo@xmath2",
    ", we briefly discuss the case of e//@xmath13 , where the intersite electronic transitions between v-1 and v-2 are important .",
    "the two transitions from v-1-@xmath57 to v-2-@xmath57 ( denoted as solid blue and red arrows in fig.2 ) are allowed for the @xmath10-plane spectra , which show a broad structure due to the broad band width of unoccupied minority spin states .",
    "these @xmath10-plane transitions produce a structure in e//@xmath13 curve at the position of peak @xmath22 of e//@xmath9 curve . due to the doubling of transition paths",
    ", one may expect a strong @xmath10-plane spectral weight .",
    "however , by calculating the matrix elements , the actual @xmath10-plane spectrum is not so much weighted due to the longer bonds in the @xmath10-plane .",
    "the shoulder in the experimental e//@xmath13 curve at about 1.5 ev , _",
    "i.e. _ , the energy of peak @xmath21 in the e//@xmath9 curve may originate from the spin disordering in the @xmath10-plane .",
    "first we note that a very tiny peak is seen at this energy in the c - af ground state configuration .",
    "this structure mainly comes from the transition from the occupied v-1-@xmath58 component to a small v-2-@xmath58 component just above the fermi level .",
    "however , this structure is too weak to explain the shoulder at 1.5 ev .",
    "if the spin state between v-1 and v-2 may become parallel like in a - af and fm , the transition corresponding to the red dashed arrow may become allowed and produces a peak as shown in fig.3 .    from the above assignment",
    ", some important parameters can be estimated by using the hartree - fock model .",
    "the peak position of @xmath21 should corresponds to energy @xmath59 , and peak @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath60 , where @xmath1 and @xmath61 are on site coulomb and exchange parameters .",
    "the estimated values for @xmath1 and @xmath61 are 2.2ev and 0.6ev from our calculations , and about 2.1ev and 0.32ev from experiments for lavo@xmath2 .",
    "the smaller @xmath61 parameter estimated from experiments may suggests the spin canting or fluctuation at elevated temperature , especially for yvo@xmath2 as discussed below .",
    "now let us discuss the low temperature phase of yvo@xmath2 . in this case ,",
    "the c - oo with g - so state is the most stable state . as the results , the strong peak @xmath22 for e//@xmath9",
    "can be explained as the transition from v-1-@xmath56 to v-3-@xmath56 as noted by the solid red arrow in fig.2b with energy @xmath60 .",
    "this transition is not allowed for the fm coupling along the @xmath9-axis as in the case of c - af or fm state , and should show strong temperature dependence as observed in experiment . as for the small peak @xmath21 ,",
    "the situation for c - oo is different from the case of lavo@xmath2 with g - oo . in the present case of c - oo ,",
    "the significant mixture of different orbitals under strongly distorted vo@xmath11 environment is crucially important to produce this small peak @xmath21 located at energy @xmath59 ( corresponding to the transition as noted by the green arrow in fig.2b ) .",
    "let us explain the situation in more details . if there is no orbital mixing ( the inter - site hybridization for the same orbitals still exists ) , @xmath53 is fully occupied and @xmath54 is empty in the majority spin state both at v-1 and v-3 .",
    "the unoccupied @xmath58 at v-1 hybridizes with unoccupied @xmath58 ( not @xmath56 ) at v-3 to produce a small @xmath58 component at v-3 site at the energy of majority spin empty state . in this case , the weight of the transition from v-1-@xmath58 to v-3-@xmath58 is zero because of the zero occupation of v-1-@xmath58 state , and the small peak @xmath21 should not exist .",
    "however , as already mentioned the orbital mixing between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is significant due to the lattice distortion and produces the partial occupation of v-1-@xmath58 state ( green line in fig.2b ) .",
    "this will contribute to the small peak @xmath21 .",
    "we should emphasize here that by keeping the c - oo any magnetic coupling along the @xmath9-axis will produce a peak around @xmath21 only through the orbital mixing and therefore the peak @xmath21 will never be strong , in contrast to the case of lavo@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , those states with different orbital ordering , like the intermediate temperature phase with g - oo and c - so , can contribute to the peak structure around @xmath21 as shown in fig.2c .",
    "[ [ yvo_3-at - intermediate - temperature-77kt116k ] ] yvo@xmath2 at intermediate temperature ( 77k@xmath16t@xmath16116k ) : ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    the observed spectra for the intermediate phase of yvo@xmath2 , which has g - oo and c - so , is hard to be explained by our calculations .",
    "our calculations suggest a picture similar to that of the low temperature phase of lavo@xmath2 , because the two systems have the same spin and orbital orderings . however , the observed spectra is quite similar to the low temperature phase of yvo@xmath2 , which has different spin and orbital orderings . in particular ,",
    "the observed peak @xmath22 is stronger than peak @xmath21 and temperature dependent , while the calculations suggest the opposite .",
    "one possible scenario to explain the observed picture is to suggest the persistence of low temperature phase ( c - oo and g - so ) at elevated temperature , or at least certain mixture of other magnetic states , like g - oo with g - so or g - oo with a - so states .",
    "this argument can be supported by the following facts .",
    "first , the small @xmath61 parameter ( about 0.25ev ) estimated from experiment suggests the possibility of strong canting or magnetic fluctuation at elevated temperature ( 100k ) .",
    "second , the recent neutron experiment  @xcite on this compound actually suggests the existence of g - type spin canting and significant reduction of magnetic moment at 100k . nevertheless , according to our calculations , to be able to reproduce the observed shape , substantial ( more than 50 percent ) mixture of low temperature phase is required .    in conclusion",
    ", we developed the first - principles plane - wave - pseudopotential method based on lda+@xmath1 to calculate the inter - band optical conductivity .",
    "we calculated the anisotropic optical conductivities of lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 for different orbital and spin ordered phases , and studied the effects of spin and orbital ordering on the anisotropy .",
    "the experimentally observed spectra for both lavo@xmath2 and yvo@xmath2 at low temperature can be qualitatively explained by our calculations . on the other hand",
    ", our calculation for the intermediate temperature phase for yvo@xmath2 suggests that substantial mixture of low temperature phase may persist at elevated temperature .",
