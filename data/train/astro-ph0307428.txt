    "collisionless shocks are pervasive throughout space and are regularly associated with objects as diverse as stellar winds , supernova remnants , galactic and extra - galactic radio jets , and accretion onto compact objects .",
    "relativistic shocks , where the shock speed is close to the speed of light , may be generated by the most energetic events ; for example , pulsar winds , blastwaves in quasars and active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they may naturally emerge as the evolved products of poynting flux - driven or matter - dominated outflows in the vicinity of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes . as relativistic  shocks propagate through space , magnetic fields upstream from the shock , at even small angles with respect to the shock normal ,",
    "are strongly modified by the lorentz transformation to the downstream frame .",
    "the downstream magnetic fields are both increased and tilted toward the plane of the shock and can have large angles with respect to the shock normal .",
    "hence , most relativistic shocks can be expected to see highly oblique magnetic fields and oblique magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) jump conditions are required to describe them .",
    "relativistic shock jump conditions have been presented in a variety of ways over the years .",
    "the standard technique for deriving the equations is to set the divergence of the stress - energy tensor equal to zero on a thin volume enclosing the shock plane and use gauss s theorem to generate the jump conditions across the shock .",
    "for example , @xcite developed the relativistic form of the rankine - hugoniot relations , using the stress - energy tensor with velocity expressed in terms of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution function for a simple gas .",
    "@xcite presented a relativistic mhd treatment of shocks in various orientations and a treatment of oblique shocks for the nonrelativistic case , eliminating the electric field by transforming to a frame where the flow velocity is parallel to the magnetic field vector ( now called the de hoffmann - teller frame ) .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , presented jump conditions without electromagnetic fields , and @xcite , also using the approach of @xcite and @xcite , developed a concise set of jump conditions for a simple gas using scalar pressure .",
    "@xcite provided a review of relativistic mhd shocks in ideal , perfectly conducting plasmas , and in particular the treatment by @xcite , which used this approach to develop the relativistic analog of cabannes shock polar @xcite , whose origins also lie in @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed hydrodynamic equations using a pressure tensor , and @xcite developed relativistic shock equations for mhd jets using scalar pressure and magnetic fields with components @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( a parallel field with a twist ) .",
    "@xcite derived mhd jump conditions using the stress - energy tensor with isotropic pressure and the maxwell field tensor . by using a lorentz transformation to the de hoffman - teller frame",
    ", they restricted shock speeds , @xmath5 , to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field and @xmath8 is the speed of light ; hence , this approach may only be used for mildly relativistic applications .",
    "all of these approaches assumed that particles encountered by the shock did not affect the shock structure , i.e. , shocked particles were treated as test particles .",
    "moreover , except for @xcite , they confined their analyses to cases of isotropic pressures , a restriction that is appropriate to thermal particles or very energetic ones subject to the diffusion approximation in the vicinity of non - relativistic shocks .",
    "the assumption of pressure isotropy must be relaxed when considering the hydrodynamics of relativistic shocks , since their inherent nature imposes anisotropy on the ion and electron distributions : this is due to the difficulty particles have streaming against relativistic flows .",
    "the computed particle anisotropies for relativistic shocks are considerable in the shock layer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , persisting up to arbitrarily high ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "the particles eventually relax to isotropy in the fluid frame far downstream , on length scales comparable to diffusive ones . however , only a small minority of accelerated particles achieve isotropy in the upstream fluid frame of relativistic shocks , due to the rapid convection to the downstream side of the flow discontinuity .",
    "these isotropized particles are present only when they manage to diffuse more than a diffusive mean free path , @xmath9 , upstream of the shock ; their contribution to the flow dynamics is therefore dominated by that of the anisotropic particles within a distance @xmath9 of the shock . for non - linear particle acceleration , where the non - thermal ion or electron populations possess a sizable fraction of the total energy or momentum fluxes ,",
    "calculating pressure anisotropy will be critical for determining the conservation of these fluxes through the shock transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the jump conditions we develop here can serve as a guide to self - consistent solutions of non - linear relativistic shock acceleration problems @xcite .",
    "= 0    here , we extend previous work by deriving a set of fully relativistic mhd jump conditions with gyrotropic pressure and oblique magnetic fields .",
    "we adopt the gyrotropic case as a specialized generalization because it by 1 is exactly realized in plane - parallel shocks and is a good approximation for oblique shocks where the flow deflection is small , i.e. ,  the field plays a passive role ( generally high alfvnic mach number cases ) , and by 1 permits a comparatively simple expression of the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "the sonic mach number , @xmath10 , used throughout our paper , refers to the shock speed compared to the fast - mode magnetosonic wave speed as described in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the upstream mass density and @xmath13 is the upstream pressure .",
    "the alfvn  mach number we refer to here is defined as @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the upstream magnetic field ) , regardless of the shock lorentz factor , @xmath16^{-1/2}$ ] ; i.e. , we use these definitions applicable to non - relativistic flows as parameters for the depiction of our results at all @xmath17 .",
    "our results are not restricted to the de hoffmann - teller frame and apply for arbitrary shock speeds and arbitrary shock obliquities .",
    "we solve these equations and determine the downstream state of the gas in terms of the upstream state first for the special case of isotropic pressure , and then , by parameterizing the ratio of pressures parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , for cases of gyrotropic pressure .",
    "a principal result of this analysis is that _ either _ dynamically important magnetic fields or significant pressure anisotropies produce marked departures from the canonical value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of @xmath2 for the shock compression ratio in an ultrarelativistic fluid .",
    "the magnetic weakening of ultrarelativistic perpendicular shocks came to prominence in the work of @xcite on the interaction of the crab pulsar s wind with its environment .",
    "the similarity of such consequences of fluid anisotropy and low alfvnic mach number fields , which are also pervasive for trans - relativistic and non - relativistic shocks , has its origin in the similar nature of the plasma and electromagnetic contributions to the spatial components of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this result may have important implications for the application of first - order fermi shock acceleration theory to gamma - ray bursts and jets in active galaxies .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on using analytic methods for determining the fluid and electromagnetic characteristics of the shock and do not explicitly include first - order fermi particle acceleration .",
    "future work will combine these results with monte carlo techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that will allow the modeling of fermi acceleration of particles , including the modification of the shock structure resulting from the backreaction of energetic particles on the upstream flow at all pertinent length scales .",
    "the jump conditions we present here , however , apply directly to test - particle  fermi acceleration in shocks with arbitrary speed and obliquity .",
    "using a cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath18-axis pointing towards the downstream direction , we consider an infinite , steady - state , plane shock traveling to the left at a speed @xmath5 with its velocity vector parallel to the normal of the plane of the shock as shown in figure [ fig : sk_box ] .",
    "the upstream fluid consists of a thin , nonrelativistic  plasma of protons and electrons in thermal equilibrium with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the unshocked proton ( electron ) temperature . a uniform magnetic field , @xmath15 , makes an angle @xmath22 with respect to the @xmath23-axis as seen from the upstream plasma frame .",
    "we keep the field weak enough to insure high alfvn  mach numbers ( i.e. ,  @xmath24 ) and thus to insure that the magnetic turbulence responsible for scattering the particles is frozen into the plasma .",
    "the @xmath25 coordinate system is oriented such that there are only two components of magnetic field , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in the upstream frame .",
    "the field will remain co - planar in the downstream frame and the downstream flow speed will be confined to the @xmath23-@xmath28 plane as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in the shock frame ,",
    "the upstream flow is in the @xmath18-direction and is described by the normalized four - velocity : @xmath29 .",
    "the downstream ( i.e. , shocked ) flow four - velocity is @xmath30 , where the subscript 0 ( 2 ) refers , here and elsewhere , to upstream ( downstream ) quantities , @xmath31 @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the corresponding lorentz factor associated with the magnitude of the flow three - velocity @xmath34 .",
    "note that these subscript conventions follow those used in @xcite , where the subscript 1 is reserved for positions infinitesimally upstream of the subshock discontinuity , admitting the possibility of flow and field gradients upstream of the subshock . here",
    "the use of subscript 1 is redundant .",
    "in addition , greek upper and lower indices refer to spacetime components 03 , while roman indices refer to space components 13 .",
    "the set of equations connecting the upstream and downstream regions of a shock consist of the continuity of particle number flux ( for conserved particles ) , momentum and energy flux conservation , plus electromagnetic boundary conditions at the shock interface , and the equation of state .",
    "the various parameters that define the state of the plasma , such as pressure and magnetic field , are determined in the plasma frame and must be lorentz transformed to the shock frame where the jump conditions apply .",
    "we assume that the electric field is zero in the local plasma rest frame . in general ,",
    "the six jump conditions plus the equation of state can not be solved analytically because the adiabatic index ( i.e. , the ratio of specific heats , whose value varies smoothly between the nonrelativistic  and ultrarelativistic  limits ) is a function of the downstream plasma parameters , creating an inherently nonlinear problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even with the assumption of gyrotropic pressure , there are more unknowns than there are equations ; however , with additional assumptions , approximate analytic solutions may be obtained .",
    "the stress - energy tensor , @xmath35 , describes the matter and electromagnetic momentum and energy content of a medium at any given point in space - time .",
    "continuity across the shock is established by setting the appropriate divergence ( or covariant derivative @xmath36 ) of the stress - energy tensor equal to zero , namely for directions locally normal to the shock . following standard expositions such as @xcite and @xcite , the total stress - energy tensor , @xmath37 ,",
    "is expressed as the sum of fluid and electromagnetic parts , i.e. , @xmath38 this is then integrated over a thin volume containing the shock plane as shown in figure [ fig : sk_box ] .",

    "notwithstanding , when particle acceleration is considered , thermal equations of state become inappropriate and simulation results become more important @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : jump_alf ] shows how @xmath1 varies as a function of @xmath129 in the ultrarelativistic  limit for various values of @xmath133 and with isotropic pressure .",
    "the compression ratio depends strongly on the _ upstream _ obliquity and can drop well below 3 for low @xmath129 .",
    "the lower right - hand panels of figures  [ fig : t5_6 ] and [ fig : t85_6 ] also show that a low @xmath129 produces magnetic stresses that cause the downstream flow to deflect from the shock normal direction , causing @xmath131 to vary inversely as @xmath129 . despite the fact that @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the approximate equations  ( [ eq : enflux])-([eq : pzflux ] ) give essentially identical results as the complete equations  ( [ pe42]-[cm34 ] ) .",
    "the impact of either mach number on @xmath130 is relatively small .",
    "the most important consequence of a large magnetic field energy density is that it lowers the compression ratio in oblique shocks ( the field is dynamically passive in parallel ones with @xmath142 ) , even when @xmath157 . the effect is contained in eq .",
    "( 4.11 ) of @xcite , which specifies the jump condition or downstream flow four - velocity for an ultrarelativistic perpendicular mhd shock .",
    "algebraically simplifying their formula , and expressing it in terms of the three - velocity compression ratio @xmath1 and alfvnic mach number @xmath129 used here , leads to the form ( for @xmath158 ) @xmath159 where the ratio @xmath160 of the magnetic plus electric energy flux to the particle energy flux that is used by @xcite is given by @xmath161 .",
    "this result applies to @xmath157 regimes , and is reproduced in the numerical results depicted in the top right hand panel of fig  [ fig : t85_6 ] and also the @xmath162 curve of fig  [ fig : jump_alf ] .",
    "the weakening of nonrelativistic  shocks at low alfvn  mach numbers is widely understood .",
    "such an effect is suggested for shocks with @xmath163 in @xcite and is also somewhat apparent for @xmath164 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite show @xmath1 as a function of @xmath129 through the trans - relativisticregime for @xmath165 .",
    "the mildly relativistic  regime was appropriate for shocked jets in active galactic nuclei , the main application of relativistic mhd shock analyses over a decade ago . here , it is evident that this lowering of @xmath1 by dynamically important magnetic fields persists up to arbitrarily high @xmath17 , a result obtained by @xcite , who applied relativistic mhd to the consideration of perpendicular pulsar termination shocks .",
    "the more recent association of ultrarelativistic shocks with cosmic gamma - ray bursts further motivates the extension to the @xmath166 regime .",
    "accordingly , this magnetic weakening of the shock has profound implications for the interpretation of gamma - ray burst spectra and associated emission mechanisms .    the origin of this effect can be attributed to the anisotropic and intrinsically relativistic nature of the field structure . in the ultrarelativistic  regime , the equation of state of a quasi - isotropic",
    ", turbulent field structure replicates that of the familiar ultrarelativistic gas with @xmath167 .",
    "however , if the field is laminar and oblique , the stress - energy tensor in equation  ( [ emt11 ] ) exhibits anisotropic stresses .",
    "this anisotropy influences the flux conservation relations for dynamically important fields when @xmath168 ; moreover it should mimic to some extent the behavior anticipated from anisotropies due to the gas contribution .",
    "such a parallel obviously emerges from results presented in the next section .      for gyrotropic pressure ,",
    "an additional constraint is needed to close the system of equations and obtain an analytical solution ; we impose this via @xmath169 where @xmath170 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath171 corresponds to isotropic pressure .",
    "equation  ( [ pressconst ] ) allows us to illustrate the effects of anisotropic pressure , but is not suggested as a model for specific acceleration scenarios . in relativistic shocks where the accelerated population contributes significantly to the total dynamical pressure ,",
    "the value of @xmath170 should deviate significantly from unity in both the upstream and downstream regions . using equation  ( [ ftrot ] ) , equation  ( [ pressconst ] )",
    "then yields @xmath172 @xmath173 and using the fluxes given in equations  ( [ pe42])([cm34 ] ) or ( [ eq : enflux])([eq : pzflux ] ) , we have a closed set of equations for the jump conditions for shocks with gyrotropic pressure , arbitrary obliquity , and arbitrary flow speed . results for various @xmath133 s and @xmath170 s are shown in figure  [ fig : aniso ] ( these results all have @xmath174 but they remain unchanged for larger mach numbers ) .",
    "the solid curves have @xmath175 , the dashed curves have @xmath176 , and the dotted curves have @xmath177 .",
    "in all cases , we have taken the pressure in the unshocked gas to be isotropic and @xmath178 is only applied downstream .",
    "while our solutions can allow for anisotropic upstream pressure , an upstream @xmath178 generally produces insignificant changes to our results for the parameter regime discussed here .",
    "notable exceptions arise when the sonic mach number is very low , i.e. @xmath179 .",
    "we observe that angular distributions at relativistic shocks generated by monte carlo simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and semi - analytic convection - diffusion equation solutions @xcite indicate that for plane - parallel scenarios with @xmath180 the accelerated particles are dominated by parallel pressure upstream ( @xmath181 ) and perpendicular pressure downstream ( @xmath182 ) when near the shock .",
    "this would suggest a possible weakening of the shock if the non - thermal population were to contribute significantly to the dynamics , thereby rendering such a contribution less likely .",
    "the picture may be much different for oblique and perpendicular shocks .",
    "the effects of anisotropic pressure on the compression ratio depend strongly on @xmath17 and @xmath133 .",
    "when @xmath133 is small , the downstream angle @xmath130 is also small at nonrelativistic  and mildly relativistic  shock speeds ( top panel of figure  [ fig : aniso ] ) .",
    "therefore , at these speeds @xmath183 and @xmath184 for any @xmath170 . since @xmath185 , the fraction of downstream pressure in @xmath186 is inversely proportional to @xmath170 and since @xmath186 largely determines @xmath1 , the compression ratio is less than the isotropic value , @xmath187 , for @xmath188 and greater than @xmath187 for @xmath177 , as shown in the figure .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath189 , @xmath130 approaches @xmath190 for any @xmath191 ( see figure  [ fig : t5_6 ] ) and @xmath192 with @xmath193 again approximately equal to zero .",
    "now , the fraction of pressure in @xmath186 will be proportional to @xmath170 and @xmath194 for @xmath182 and @xmath195 for @xmath181 .",
    "the transition where @xmath1 crosses @xmath187 occurs at slower shock speeds as @xmath22 increases ( see the @xmath196 panel of figure  [ fig : aniso ] ) until @xmath22 is large enough ( @xmath197 panel ) so no transition occurs .",
    "while the examples in figure  [ fig : aniso ] all have @xmath174 , the transition @xmath132 is independent of mach number .",
    "the dependence of @xmath130 on @xmath170 is relatively small for the examples shown in figure  [ fig : aniso ] but @xmath131 can change significantly with anisotropy , as shown in the bottom panel for the @xmath198 example .    in figure",
    "[ fig : r_vs_ani ] we show @xmath1 as a function of @xmath170 for various mach numbers and @xmath133 s , all in the ultrarelativistic  limit .",
    "the top panel shows that @xmath1 is relatively insensitive to the upstream magnetic field angle , with the lower panel showing a somewhat greater sensitivity to mach number .",
    "the most important aspect of these plots is the fact that @xmath1 can be either higher or lower than the canonical value of 3 if anisotropic pressure is important .",
    "this contrasts with the effects of a magnetic field ( with isotropic pressure ) , where low @xmath129",
    "s in the ultrarelativistic  limit gave @xmath199 only ( figures  [ fig : t85_6 ] and [ fig : jump_alf ] ) .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : r_approx ] ) is equivalent to equation  ( [ eq : kcjump ] ) from @xcite .",
    "once @xmath1 is determined , the downstream @xmath28-component of @xmath206 can be found from equation  ( [ eq : dsmag ] ) .",
    "we have derived shock jump conditions for arbitrary shock speeds and obliquities . when combined with a simple approximation for the ratio of specific heats ( equation  [ specheat ] ) , these equations specify the downstream conditions in terms of upstream parameters for isotropic pressure . for the case of gyrotropic pressure , an additional arbitrary parameter ( equation  [ pressconst ] ) is required to close the set of equations and we have presented a number of solutions where the downstream pressure is gyrotropic .",
    "the exact equations for energy and momentum conservation are fairly complicated , but we have presented simpler , approximate results ( equations  [ eq : enflux]-[eq : pzflux ] ) which are extremely accurate in a wide parameter regime ( i.e. ,  @xmath216 ; @xmath217 ; @xmath218 ) for any shock speed or obliquity . to our knowledge , this is the first presentation of oblique shock solutions with gyrotropic pressure that continuously span the domains of nonrelativistic , trans - relativistic , and ultrarelativistic  shocks of arbitrary obliquity .",
    "in addition , we have presented an analytic solution for the shock compression ratio , @xmath1 , in the limit of ultrarelativistic  shock speeds valid for oblique shocks of any @xmath10 or @xmath129 with gyrotropic pressure ( equation  [ eq : r_anis_sol ] ) .",
    "the results presented here assume that no first - order fermi acceleration occurs , but they apply directly to test - particle acceleration where the energy density in accelerated particles is small .",
    "they also constitute an important ingredient in more complex models of nonlinear particle acceleration . in the test - particle case ,",
    "the compression ratio @xmath1 is altered by large magnetic fields and/or anisotropic pressures , even at ultrarelativistic  speeds .",
    "the observation of marked departures from the canonical value of @xmath2 for the compression ratio of an ultrarelativistic shock , for either dynamically important fields or significant pressure anisotropies , is a major result of this paper . in the case of magnetic field influences on the dynamics of relativistic shocks ,",
    "our results extend the conclusions of @xcite to all shock obliquities .",
    "the similarity of such consequences of fluid anisotropy and low alfvnic mach numbers is a consequence of the similar nature of the plasma and electromagnetic contributions to the spatial components of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the importance of this result is obvious , since changes in @xmath1 map directly to changes in the power - law index of the accelerated spectrum .",
    "this power law is the most important characteristic of test - particle fermi acceleration , and is usually associated with trans - relativistic  internal shocks in gamma - ray burst ( grb ) models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , the outer blast wave is an ultrarelativistic shock during most of its active phase , sweeping up and accelerating interstellar material .",
    "this shock , believed to produce long - lasting afterglows , eventually transitions to a non - relativistic phase .",
    "our results are directly applicable to test - particle acceleration models of both the internal and external shocks in grbs , as well as to shocks believed to exist in jets in active galactic nuclei . in future work",
