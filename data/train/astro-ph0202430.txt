    "deep x  ray surveys indicate that the cosmic x  ray background ( xrb ) is largely due to accretion onto supermassive black holes , integrated over cosmic time . in the soft ( 0.52 kev ) band",
    "more than 90% of the xrb flux has been resolved using a 1.4 msec observation with _ rosat _ ( @xcite ) and recently two 1 msec _",
    "chandra _ observations ( @xcite ) and a 100 ksec observation with _ xmm  newton _ ( @xcite ) ( see figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig1 ] ) . in the harder ( 210 kev ) band",
    "a similar fraction of the background has been resolved with the above _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton surveys _ , reaching source densities of about 4000 deg@xmath0 .",
    "surveys in the very hard ( 510 kev ) band have been pioneered using _",
    "bepposax _ , which resolved about 30% of the xrb ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ xmm  newton _ and _ chandra _ have now also resolved the majority ( 6070% ) of the very hard x  ray background .",
    "the distribution shows a significant cosmological flattening in the softer bands ( see figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig2 ] ) , while in the very hard band it is still relatively steep , indicating that those surveys have not yet sampled the redshifts where the strong cosmological evolution of the sources saturates .",
    "optical followup programs with 810 m telescopes have been completed for the rosat deep surveys and find predominantly active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as counterparts of the faint x ",
    "ray source population ( @xcite ) mainly x  ray and optically unobscured agn ( type1 seyferts and qsos ) and a smaller fraction of obscured agn ( type2 seyferts ) .",
    "optical identifications for the deepest _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ fields are still far from complete , however a mixture of obscured and unobscured agn with an increasing fraction of obscuration seems to be the dominant population in these samples , too ( @xcite ; see below ) .",
    "interestingly , first examples of the long  sought class of high  redshift , high  luminosity , heavily obscured active galactic nuclei ( type2 qso ) have been detected in deep _",
    "chandra _ fields ( @xcite ) and in the _ xmm  newton _ deep survey in the _ lockman hole _ field ( @xcite ) .",
    "after having understood the basic contributions to the x  ray background , the general interest is now focussing on understanding the physical nature of these sources , the cosmological evolution of their properties , and their role in models of galaxy evolution .",
    "we know that basically every galaxy with a spheroidal component in the local universe has a supermassive black hole in its center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity function of x  ray selected agn shows strong cosmological density evolution at redshifts up to 2 , which goes hand in hand with the cosmic star formation history ( @xcite ) . at the redshift peak of",
    "optically selected qsos around z=2.5 the agn space density is several hundred times higher than locally , which is in line with the assumption that most galaxies have been active in the past and that the feeding of their black holes is reflected in the x  ray background .",
    "while the comoving space density of optically and radio  selected qso declines significantly beyond a redshift of 3 ( @xcite ) , a similar decline has not yet been observed in the x  ray selected agn population ( @xcite ) , although the statistical quality of the high  redshift agn samples needs to be improved .",
    "the new _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ surveys are bound to give additional constraints here .    the x ",
    "ray observations have so far been about consistent with population synthesis models based on unified agn schemes ( @xcite ) , which explain the hard spectrum of the x  ray background by a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed agn , folded with the corresponding luminosity function and its cosmological evolution . according to these models",
    ", most agn spectra are heavily absorbed and about 80% of the light produced by accretion will be absorbed by gas and dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these models are far from unique and contain a number of hidden assumptions , so that their predictive power remains limited until complete samples of spectroscopically classified hard x  ray sources are available . in particular they require a substantial contribution of high  luminosity obscured x  ray sources ( type2 qsos ) , which so far have only scarcely been detected .",
    "the cosmic history of obscuration and its potential dependence on intrinsic source luminosity remain completely unknown .",
    "@xcite e.g. assumed strong evolution of the obscuration fraction ( ratio of type2/type1 agn ) from 4:1 in the local universe to much larger covering fractions ( 10:1 ) at high redshifts ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the gas to dust ratio in high  redshift , high ",
    "luminosity agn could be completely different from the usually assumed galactic value due to sputtering of the dust particles in the strong radiation field ( @xcite )",
    ". this might provide objects which are heavily absorbed at x ",
    "rays and unobscured at optical wavelengths .    in this paper",
    "i shortly discuss the current status of the optical identification work in the _ rosat / xmm  newton_/ _ chandra _ deep survey in the _ lockman hole _",
    ", which is largely based on optical work with the keck telescope led by maarten schmidt ( see @xcite and @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "i also present preliminary results of optical identifications in the _ chandra deep field south _ , obtained with the eso vlt , which will be formally published in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "i then discuss the results and try to come to some tentative conclusions about the evolution of x  ray sources at high redshifts .",
    "the _ lockman hole _ field has been observed with the _ xmm  newton _ observatory during the performance verification phase ( see figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig1]a ) .",
    "about 100 ksec good data , centered on the same sky position as the _ rosat hri _ pointing , have been accumulated with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) reaching minimum fluxes of 0.31 , 1.4 and 2.4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg cm@xmath0 s@xmath4 in the 0.52 , 210 and 510 kev energy bands . within an off  axis angle of 10 arcmin 148 , 112 and 61 sources , respectively , have been detected . in the 510 kev energy band a somewhat lower sensitivity compared to the 1msec _ chandra deep field south _ observation has been reached ( see @xcite ) , resolving @xmath560 % of the very hard x  ray background ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is about a factor of 20 more sensitive than the previous _ bepposax _ observations .",
    "a total of 300 ksec observations of the lockman hole has been accumulated with the _ chandra _ hrc in the 0.57.0 kev band , reaching a similar flux limit compared to the _ xmm  newton _ pointing ( @xcite ) .",
    "hrc data provide very accurate source positions , whereas _ xmm  newton _ allows spectrophotometry of very faint intrinsically absorbed x  ray sources due to its unprecedented sensitivity in the hard band .",
    "the optical counterparts for @xmath560 x  ray sources are already known from the spectroscopic identification of the _ rosat ultradeep survey _ sample ( @xcite ) . among them are one of the most distant x  ray selected quasars at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) and one of the highest redshift , probably merging cluster of galaxies at @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",

    "slit mask spectra taken with the lris instrument at the keck ii telescope in march 2001 ( pi : m. schmidt ; @xcite ) . among the new xmm sources we have found only a few new broad emission line agns ( type1 ) , while the optical spectra of most new sources show narrow emission lines and/or only galaxy  like continuum emission at redshifts @xmath8 . in several cases high ionisation emission lines like @xmath9ne  v@xmath10 $ ] @xmath11 are absent and thus we see no sign for agn activity in the optical spectrum , however , their high x  ray luminosity ( l@xmath12 erg s@xmath4 ) and/or the strong intrinsic absorption ( log n@xmath13 ) reveal a type2 agn in these sources . three new sources showing typical galaxy spectra , have been detected only in the 0.52.0 kev band . due to their relatively low",
    "x  ray luminosities ( log l@xmath14 ) and their soft x",
    " ray spectra ( no indication for intrinsic absorption ) we classify them as normal galaxies . several sources with x  ray luminosities in the range of @xmath15 log l@xmath16 , which show galaxy  like optical spectra , are hard to classify due to the small number of photons in their x  ray spectra .",
    "we preliminarily classify them as type2 agn / galaxy .",
    "the completeness of the identification ranges from 61% in the soft sample to 79% in the ultra hard sample ( 510 kev energy band ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the so far spectroscopically identified sources are type1 and type2 agns .",
    "although we have no complete identification so far we find a strong indication for a larger fraction of type2 agns , especially in the ultra hard sample , compared to that ( @xmath520% ) of the uds .",
    "nearly all spectroscopically identified type2 agns are at moderate redshift ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "one type2 qso candidate ( x174a ) at @xmath18 has been identified in the lockman hole region so far ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the unidentified faint _ xmm  newton _",
    "sources have very faint optical counterparts ( @xmath19 ) and at least half of them are extremely red objects ( eros , @xmath20 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the new _ xmm  newton _ sources with eros as optical counterparts are similar to those objects in the uds with photometric redshifts suggesting obscured agns at redshifts @xmath21 .",
    "the photometric redshift technique is probably the only tool to identify such faint optical objects .",
    "the _ xmm  newton _",
    "source population at faint fluxes is therefore likely dominated by obscured agns ( type2 ) , as predicted by the agn population synthesis models for the x  ray background .",
    "the _ chandra x  ray observatory _ has performed deep x ",

    "i discuss results from the 940 ksec cdfs observation",
    ". the source counts ( see figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig2 ] ) have been extended to @xmath22 in the soft 0.52 kev band and @xmath23 in the hard 210 kev band , reaching a space density of almost @xmath24 , resolving @xmath25 of the background in both bands .",
    "a total of 346 sources has been detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "deep optical imaging and multiobject spectroscopy has been performed in 12 nights with the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) in the time frame april 2000  december 2001 , using the fors instruments with individual exposure times ranging from 15 hours .",
    "some preliminary results including the vlt optical spectroscopy have already been presented elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "a complete optical spectroscopy catalogue will be published by @xcite .",
    "figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig3 ] shows examples of 4 vlt spectra .",
    "the upper two spectra show high  redshift qsos with restframe  uv absorption features ( bal or mini  bal qsos ) , which both have some indication of intrinsic absorption in their x  ray spectra .",
    "the object in the lower left is the famous , highest redshift type2 qso detected in the cdfs with heavy x  ray absorption in the qso rest frame ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum in the lower right shows a seyfert2 galaxy with heavy x  ray absorption and an agn  type luminosity .",
    "the latter spectrum is characteristic for the bulk of the detected galaxies , which show either no or very faint high excitation lines indicating the agn nature of the object , so that we have to resort to a combination of optical and x  ray diagnostics to classify them as agn ( see below ) .",
    "redshifts could be obtained so far for 169 of the 360 sources in the cdfs , of which 123 are very reliable ( high quality spectra with 2 or more spectral features ) , while the remaining optical spectra contain only a single emission line , or are too noisy . for objects fainter than r=24 reliable redshifts can be obtained ( see also figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig5 ] ) , if the spectra contain strong emission lines . for the remaining optically faint objects we have to resort to photometric redshift techniques .",
    "about 11% of the cdfs sources have no counterpart even in deep vlt optical images ( @xmath26 ) or near  ir imaging ( 15% at @xmath27 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , for a subsection of the sample at off  axis angles smaller than 8 arcmin we obtain a spectroscopic completeness of about 60% .",
    "type1 agn ( seyfert1 and qsos ) can be often readily identified by the broad permitted emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "luminous seyfert2 galaxies show strong forbidden emission lines and high  excitation lines indicating photoionization by a hard continuum source . however , already in the spectroscopic identifications of the _ rosat _ deep surveys it became apparent , that an increasing fraction of faint x  ray selected agn shows a significant , sometimes dominant contribution of stellar light from the host galaxy in their optical spectra , depending on the ratio of optical luminosity between nuclear and galaxy light ( @xcite ) .",
    "if an agn is outshined by its host galaxy it is not possible to detect it optically .",
    "many of the counterparts of the faint x ",
    "ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ show optical spectra which are dominated by their host galaxy and only a minority has clear indications of an agn nature ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in these cases , the x  ray emission could still be dominated by the active galactic nucleus , while a contribution from stellar and thermal processes ( hot gas from supernova remnants , starbursts and thermal halos , or a population of x  ray binaries ) can be important as well .",
    "in these cases x  ray diagnostics in addition to the optical spectroscopy can be crucial to classify the source of the x  ray emission .",
    "agn have typically ( but not always ! ) x  ray luminosities above @xmath28 and power law spectra , often with significant intrinsic absorption .",
    "local , well  studied starburst galaxies have integrated x  ray luminosities typically below @xmath28 and very soft x ",
    "ray spectra .",
    "thermal haloes of galaxies and the intergalactic gas in groups can have higher x  ray luminosities , but has soft spectra as well . the redshift effect in addition",
    "helps the x  ray diagnostic , because soft x  ray spectra appear even softer already at moderate redshift , while the typical agn power law spectra appear harder over a very wide range of redshifts .    in figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig4 ] the x  ray hardness ratio is shown as a function of the x  ray luminosity ( in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev , or 0.510 kev band , depending on in which band the object was detected ) for 170 sources for which we have optical spectra and reliable redshifts in the cdfs ( @xcite",
    "; see also @xcite ) and the _ lockman hole _",
    "( @xcite ) for x  ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ , respectively .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the net count rates in the hard ( 27 kev for _ chandra _ and 24.5 kev for _ xmm  newton _ ) and the soft band ( 0.52 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the x  ray luminosities are not corrected for internal absorption and are computed assuming @xmath32 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and @xmath33 .",
    "although this diagram is for illustration purposes only and a a correct treatment would have to properly take into account the different instrument characteristics and detection bands , it clearly shows a segregation of the different x  ray emitters ( indicated by the dashed elliptical outlines .",
    "type1 agns have luminosities above @xmath28 and hardness ratios scattered around @xmath34 , corresponding to a power law photon index around @xmath35 , typical for the intrinsic continuum of agn .",
    "type2 agn have observed luminosities above @xmath36 ( intrinsically higher ) , but are scattered to much larger hardness ratios ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "direct spectral fits of the xmm  newton and ( some ) chandra spectra clearly indicate , that these harder spectra are due to neutral gas absorption and not due to a flatter intrinsic slope ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that no high  luminosity , very hard sources exist in this diagram .",
    "this is due to a selection effect of the pencil beam surveys : due to the small solid angle , the rare high luminosity sources are only sampled at high redshifts , where the absorption cutoff of type2 agn is redshifted to softer x  ray energies .",
    "indeed , the type2 qsos in this sample ( @xcite ) are the objects at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    about 10% of the sources have optical spectra of normal galaxies , x  ray luminosities below @xmath28 and very soft spectra ( @xmath40 ) , typical for starburst galaxies or hot gas halos .",
    "the deep _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ surveys therefore for the first time detect the population of normal starburst galaxies out to intermediate redshifts ( @xcite ) , for which a significant contribution to the xrb had been claimed for a long time ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "those galaxies , however , appear at much lower fluxes and therefore produce an almost negligible contribution to the background .",
    "they might become an important means to study the star formation history in the universe completely independently from optical / uv , sub  mm or radio observations .",
    "however , in the x  ray luminosity range around @xmath28 , where the emission from star forming processes and the central agn may be comparable , there will always remain ambiguities .    the joint optical / x  ray diagnostics scheme can also be applied to the spectroscopically identified x  ray sources in other deep _ chandra _ fields in order to obtain an as complete sample of faint x  ray source classification as possible .",
    "table 1 gives a summary of optical identifications and x  ray source types in the two deep fields discussed here , as well as in the _",
    "hawaii 13hr _ field , the _ abell 370 _ cluster field and the _ hubble deep field north _ which all have spectroscopically identified samples in the literature ( @xcite ) .    ._chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ survey identifications [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ghasinger - f1:tab_surv ]    @xmath41 only 27 kev band detections considered",
    "all the above samples have a spectroscopic completeness of about 60% , which is mainly caused by the fact that about 40% of the counterparts are optically too faint to obtain reliable spectra .",
    "this incompleteness is probably also reflecting some redshift bias , most likely higher redshift objects are missing , as well as faint emission line objects , where the strongest emission lines ( [ oii ] , ly@xmath42 ) fall outside the optical bands . on the other hand ,",
    "the optically faintest identified sources ( r=2425 ) are distributed throughout the whole redshift range z=04 ( see figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig5 ] ) , therefore there is reason to believe that a substantial fraction of the so far unidentified sources follows the same redshift distribution as the identified sources .",
    "the completeness of 60% therefore allows to compare the redshift distribution with predictions from x  ray background population synthesis models ( @xcite ) , based on the agn x  ray luminosity function and its evolution as determined from the rosat surveys ( @xcite ) , which predict a maximum at redshifts around z=1.5 .",
    "figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig6 ] shows two predictions of the redshift distribution from the @xcite model for a flux limit of @xmath43 in the 0.52 kev band with different assumptions for the high  redshift evolution of the qso space density .",
    "the two models from @xcite have been normalized at the peak of the distribution .",
    "the actually observed redshift distribution does not vary significantly within the flux limit range covered by the samples in table 1 , therefore the total observed redshift distribution is shown in figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig6 ] for the total number of @xmath44 sources in all samples .",
    "the observed redshift distribution , arbitrarily normalized to roughly fit the population synthesis models in the redshift range 1.5  3 kev is radically different from the prediction , with a peak at a redshift in the range 0.50.7 .",
    "this is still the case , if the objects belonging to the large scale structures around z=0.7 in the cdfs are removed .",
    "the total number of objects at redshift less than 1 is significantly higher than the model predictions , even ignoring the 40% spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the peak at redshifts below 1 is also significant , if the normal star forming galaxies in the sample are removed .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the population synthesis models will have to be modified to incorporate different luminosity functions and evolutionary scenarios for intermediate ",
    "redshift , low ",
    "luminosity agn .",
    "the comparison between the observed and predicted n(z ) distributions at high redshifts is complicated by the possible existence of large  scale structure in the pencil beam survey ( there is e.g. a possibly significant excess of objects around z=2.5 in the cdfs ) , but also by redshift ",
    "dependent selection effects and in general by the still relatively small volume sampled and therefore poor counting statistics in the number of objects .",
    "in addition , the overall normalization of the curves is uncertain because of the significant mismatch of the distribution at low z. nevertheless , the observed distribution is roughly consistent with both predictions in the redshift range z=1.63.8",
    ". there is , however , a significant discrepancy between the observed distribution and the constant space density model ( dotted line ) at redshifts above 4 , where only one object was detected , while about 8 objects would be predicted . from figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig5 ] it becomes apparent , that the dearth of x  ray selected agn is probably not due to optical spectroscopic selection effects .",
    "the one object detected at z=4.45 already in the rosat data of the lockman hole ( @xcite ) has an optical magnitude of r=23 and is therefore not at the spectroscopic limit of the samples .",
    "also the @xmath45 and civ lines for qsos in the redshift range 45 fall well into the optical range .",
    "the observed redshift distribution therefore gives a strong indication for a decline of the qso space density beyond a redshift of 3.8 .",
    "a similar conclusion about a decline of the x  ray selected agn space density at high redshifts can be obtained from the absence of qsos with @xmath46 in all x  ray survey samples so far .",
    "( there was a recent announcement of a qso at z=5.2 in the chandra observation of the hdf ",
    "n , but this does not change the conclusions discussed below ) .",
    "figure [ ghasinger - f1:fig7 ] shows a prediction of number counts for high  redshift qso from @xcite , according to which a large number of @xmath46 agn should be detected in any deep survey with chandra .",
    "this theoretical model assumes the x  ray luminosity function at z=3.5 determined from the rosat surveys and extrapolates it backwards in time assuming a simple hierarchical cdm model and a constant black hole mass fraction throughout .",
    "the figure also shows limits for the number counts of @xmath46 agn from x  ray surveys at varying flux limits .",
    "the most distant qso among @xmath47 objects in the rosat bright survey ( rbs , @xcite ) has a redshift of 2.8 , the lack of higher redshift objects is , however , not constraining given the high flux limit of this survey .",
    "the lack of @xmath46 agn in the rosat deep and ultradeep surveys ( @xcite ) is still just consistent with the haiman & loeb predictions , the highest ",
    "redshift object in the uds is rx  j105225.9 + 571905 at z=4.45 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the chandra deep survey , while only about 60% spectroscopically identified , still provides an upper limit for the number counts of @xmath46 agn significantly lower than the prediction , using the conservative assumption that less than half of the unidentified objects are at redshifts larger than 5 . finally , the 400 ksec chandra observation in the hubble deep field proper , providing 100% identifications for 12 sources in the field and their highest redshift object at z=4.42 just outside the hdf ",
    "n also gives an upper limit about a factor of three lower than the haiman & loeb prediction .",
    "the information about the space density of x  ray selected agn is still limited by the small number statistics in the deep x  ray surveys which cover too small a solid angle . more and wider fields have been surveyed by both chandra and xmm  newton .",
    "as soon as the tedious and time consuming optical follow  up work in these fields is completed , we will be able to learn more about the decline of the x  ray agn and therefore their formation at early redshifts .",
    "the possible discrepancy between a declining space density of optical and radio  selected qsos above a redshift of 2.7 and an apparently constant space density of x  ray selected agn with a decline beyond a redshift of @xmath48 could still be understood in terms of the different luminosity and therefore different black hole mass of the objects involved .",
    "the optical and radio surveys cover a large solid angle to a modest flux limit and therefore pick up only the most luminous and therefore most massive objects at high redshift .",
    "the deep pencil beam surveys , on the other hand , sample a much smaller volume to much fainter flux limits and therefore select high  redshift agn which are intrinsically a factor of more than 10 less luminous and therefore probably less massive than the objects selected in wide  angle surveys . in the hierarchical large scale structure formation",
    "the smaller cold dark matter halos collapse earlier than the larger ones . given the correlation between black hole mass and galaxy mass ( and presumably dark matter mass ) ,",
    "it is expected that the lower mass black holes are formed earlier than the most massive objects and thus that lower luminosity agn appear earlier than the most luminous qsos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this concept can be tested with more optical identifications of chandra and xmm  newton surveys and with future , even more sensitive x  ray telescopes , like the esa / isas xeus mission .",

    "<S> the space density of the x  ray selected agn , as determined from rosat surveys does not seem to decline as rapidly as that of optically selected qso , however , the statistics of the high  redshift samples is still rather poor . </S>",
    "<S> the new _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ surveys at significantly fainter fluxes are starting to provide additional constraints here , but the preliminary observed redshift distribution peaks at much lower redshifts ( z=0.50.7 ) than the predictions based on the rosat luminosity function . </S>"
