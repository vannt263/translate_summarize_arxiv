    "one of the main challenges in condensed matter physics is to find simple yet accurate analytical approximations for systems in non - perturbative ( strongly coupled ) regimes .",
    "this is needed for interpretation of experiments and to help supplement the results available from numerical simulations of model hamiltonians .    in this general context",
    ", we have recently proposed the so - called momentum average ( ma ) approximation for the green s function of a single holstein polaron.@xcite the essence of this approximation is to sum all diagrams contributing to the polaron self - energy , however each diagram is approximated to such a degree as to allow the analytical summation of the entire series .",
    "specifically , each free propagator appearing in a self - energy diagram is replaced by its momentum average .",
    "the resulting ma self - energy is a trivial - to - evaluate continued fraction which gives remarkably accurate results over most of the parameter space , including intermediate electron - phonon coupling strengths where perturbational methods completely fail to capture the correct physics .    in refs .",
    "and we identified some of the reasons for this good agreement : first , the ma approximation becomes asymptotically exact for both very weak and very strong couplings .",
    "more importantly , the resulting ma spectral weight satisfies the first six spectral weight sum rules exactly , and remains highly accurate for all higher order sum rules .",
    "however , we also pointed out some shortcomings of the ma approximation : ( i ) it fails to predict the continuum that must appear at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the polaron ground - state ( gs ) energy , and @xmath2 is the frequency of the einstein phonons ( we set @xmath3 throughout this work ) .",
    "this continuum arises from states that have a phonon excited very far from where the polaron is . as a result ,",
    "their interactions are negligible and the energy of the system is simply the sum of the two .",
    "ma either predicts a wrong location for this continuum ( at weak electron - phonon couplings ) or no continuum at all in that range of energies ( at intermediary and strong electron - phonon couplings ) .",
    "we noted in ref . that numerical simulations show that there is very little spectral weight in this continuum , hence its absence or wrong positioning does not significantly upset the agreement with the sum rules .",
    "nevertheless , it would be reassuring to have an approximation that correctly predicts its existence ; ( ii ) the accuracy of the ma approximation worsens as @xmath4 ; ( iii ) the ma self - energy @xmath5 is independent of the momentum @xmath6 of the electron . given how featureless the holstein model is ( electron - phonon coupling and phonon frequency are both constants ) one may expect a rather weak momentum dependence of the self - energy , however it is certainly not entirely absent .    in this article , we show how to systematically improve the ma approximation , generating a hierarchy of approximations that we call ma@xmath7 ( the original ma is ma@xmath8 in this notation ) .",
    "as explained below , the idea is to systematically improve the accuracy of the `` simplified '' self - energy diagrams .",
    "the results become more and more accurate as @xmath9 increases  for example , while the ma spectral weight satisfies only the first 6 sum rules exactly , this improves to 8 and 10 exact sum rules respectively for ma@xmath10 and ma@xmath11 spectral weights . while the numerical effort also increases , it is still trivial for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels that we discuss explicitly here .",
    "level ma@xmath10 already solves the continuum problem , while all levels with @xmath14 produce momentum - dependent self - energies .",
    "the accuracy in the limit @xmath15 is also shown to improve significantly with increasing @xmath9 . in effect , for a slightly increased numerical effort , ma@xmath11 solves all the known problems of the ma@xmath8 approximation .    the work is organized as follows : in sec . ii we briefly review the ma@xmath8 approximation , presenting a new argument to explain its accuracy . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the systematic approach to obtain the improved versions ma@xmath7 , @xmath16 , and give explicit formulae for the self - energies corresponding to the ma@xmath10 and ma@xmath11 approximations . in sec .",
    "iv we compare the predictions of these approximations against numerical simulations , to gauge the improved accuracy as @xmath9 increases .",
    "spectral sum rules , as well as variational arguments , will also be used to explain the systematic improvement of accuracy with increasing @xmath9 .",

    "( [ eq : f ] ) as an inhomogeneous system of linear equations in unknowns @xmath44 , then the only inhomogeneous term appears in the first equation and is proportional to @xmath45 .",

    "as already stated , ma@xmath8 consists in replacing all free propagators in all self - energy diagrams by their momentum average : @xmath58 obviously , this corresponds to replacing the free propagator pre - factors on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) by the corresponding @xmath59 . in this case",
    ", it is straightforward to see that the resulting solutions , denoted @xmath60 , are functions of @xmath54 only ( all dependence on phonon momenta disappears at this level of approximation ) .",
    "the resulting equations @xmath61 $ ] and for @xmath62 , @xmath63 $ ] are solved in terms of continued fractions@xcite ( also see appendix [ ap1 ] ) to find:@xcite @xmath64 where we define the infinite continued fractions : @xmath65 results based on this ma@xmath8 approximation have been analyzed in detail in ref . .    .",
    "]    before discussing how to systematically improve this approximation , it is worth pointing out an alternative explanation for its good accuracy.@xcite this comes from realizing that in real space , the meaning of the ma@xmath8 approximation is that it replaces all free - propagators @xmath66 appearing in all self - energy diagrams , by @xmath67 .",
    "for example , consider the real - space , second - order green s function diagram depicted in fig .",
    "it has the exact value @xmath68 where the contribution to self - energy from the second - order crossed self - energy diagram is : @xmath69 within ma@xmath8 , @xmath70 is approximated as @xmath71 .",
    "inserting this into the green s function diagram removes one of the sums , and after fourier transforming we find that the contribution of this diagram to @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "the same holds for all higher order diagrams . summing all of them",
    ", we see that the free propagators in the _ proper self - energy parts _ have indeed been replaced by their momentum averages .",
    "the reason why it is a good zero - order approximation to keep only the diagonal ( in real space ) contributions @xmath74 is straightforward to understand , at least for low energies @xmath75 . because of interactions , @xmath76 ( the polaron ground - state is below the free electron continuum ) .",
    "it follows that for @xmath75 , the free propagators @xmath66 are needed at energies below the free electron continuum , and the larger @xmath9 is the further below the band - edge these energies are .",
    "however , it is well - known that for @xmath77 , the free propagator decreases exponentially with increasing distance @xmath78 .",
    "the reason is that there are no free - electron eigenstates outside the free - electron band , and the electron has to tunnel from one site to another .",
    "for example , in one dimension@xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the first quadrant solution of the equation @xmath81 . for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 increases as @xmath54 decreases .",
    "we also used the fact that in terms of its fourier transform : @xmath85    it follows that at low energies , ma@xmath8 keeps the largest contributions to the self - energy ( from real - space diagonal terms ) , while ignoring exponentially small contributions coming from off - diagonal terms .",
    "this is expected to become more and more accurate for higher order diagrams with many phonons : the larger @xmath9 is , the faster the exponential decay with distance of @xmath66 becomes .",
    "based on these arguments one expects at least low - energy properties to be well described by ma , at least if @xmath2 is not too small .",
    "together with the good agreement@xcite with the spectral weight sum rules , this leads to the conclusion that the self - energy and the green s function at all energies should indeed be quite accurate within ma .",
    "comparison with numerics validates this.@xcite",
    "the above arguments also suggest a systematic way towards improving the ma@xmath8 approximation . the biggest error at low energies is due to the momentum average of the propagators of energy @xmath87 .",
    "this is the energy closest to the free electron continuum and therefore these propagators have the slowest decay in real space . the next slowest decay is for the propagators of energy @xmath88 , etc .",
    "if one could selectively keep these propagators exactly while momentum - averaging the ones with more phonons ( lower energy , faster decay ) this should improve the accuracy of the approximation at low energies .",
    "in fact , all sum rules would also be improved ( individual diagrams are more accurate ) therefore one would expect an improvement at all energies .",
    "this is precisely what the higher levels ma@xmath7 , @xmath16 , achieve .",
    "we define ma@xmath7 as being the approximation where in all self - energy diagrams , all free propagators with energy @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , are kept exactly , while the ones with more than @xmath9 phonons are momentum averaged .    in terms of the equations - of - motion that need to be solved , eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) , achieving this is straightforward , since a propagator of energy @xmath91 appears only once , in the right - hand side pre - factor of the equation for @xmath92 .",
    "it follows that if we keep the first @xmath9 of eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) as they are , and approximate the equations for @xmath93 by momentum - averaging the free propagator appearing in the right - hand side pre - factor @xmath94 if @xmath95 , we achieve our goal  provided that we can find the solution of the resulting infinite system of coupled equations .",
    "we now derive explicitly the solutions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels .      in this case , the equations to be solved are : @xmath96 where @xmath97\\ ] ] and for all @xmath62 ,    @xmath98.\\ ] ]    as before , the dependence on @xmath99 is implicitly assumed everywhere .",
    "we use the upper labels @xmath100 because these are the approximative solutions corresponding to ma@xmath10 .",

    "( [ cf ] ) .",
    "this expression is slightly more complicated than @xmath104 , since it involves two different continued fractions , however it is still very trivial to compute .",
    "note that based on this and other results derived in appendix [ ap2 ] , we can now calculate the ma@xmath10 expressions for the generalized green s functions @xmath105 .",
    "these will be more accurate than the values obtained within the ma@xmath8 approximation , where none of the @xmath60 expression had any momentum dependence .",
    "these generalized green s functions contain further information about the polaron , for example regarding the phonon statistics .    as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ma1 ] ) , the self - energy is still momentum independent at this level .",
    "however , it is clear that this is because the holstein model is so featureless .",
    "if , _ e.g. _ the coupling was dependent on the phonon momentum , then the first self - energy diagram @xmath106 would be @xmath53 dependent , and so would @xmath107 ( this diagram is exact at ma@xmath10 level ) . indeed , work in progress on generalizing this approach to models with @xmath108 coupling verifies this .",
    "it is also clear that even for the holstein model , all expressions @xmath109 with @xmath62 will have momentum dependence , since holstein self - energy diagrams of second order are momentum dependent .",
    "we demonstrate below that this is indeed the case .",
    "finally , the ma approximation becomes exact in the limit @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the first limit is trivial , since @xmath112 .",
    "the second is due to the fact that if @xmath113 then free propagators @xmath114 are in fact independent of @xmath53 , and thus the momentum averages become irrelevant .",

    "we present here the most efficient solution that we have found , and then comment briefly on other possible solutions .",

    "first , observe that @xmath131 , by definition .",
    "as shown in appendix [ ap3 ] , the set of two closed equations above can be rewritten as an inhomogeneous equation involving @xmath132 ( at all lattice sites ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 @xmath135 and the expression of the matrix elements @xmath136 is given in eqs .",
    "( [ moo]-[mij ] ) .",
    "they have simple expressions , involving only ( the same ) three continued fractions @xmath137 as well as various @xmath138 values , therefore they can be calculated easily .",
    "because at low energies the free propagators in real space decay exponentially , one expects that @xmath132 decreases fast with increasing distance @xmath129 .",
    "alternatively , consider , for instance , the @xmath139 contribution to @xmath140 .",
    "when fourier transformed , the initial state @xmath141 goes into @xmath142 , i.e. the phonon is further and further apart from the electron .",
    "similar interpretation can be given for the second contribution to @xmath132 .",
    "one expects the amplitudes for such processes to decay with @xmath143 .    as a result",
    ", we can truncate the system of equations ( [ x1 ] ) , assuming that @xmath144 for all @xmath129 larger than a cutoff .",
    "we vary this cutoff to insure that convergence has indeed been achieved . in this formulation",
    ", we find that convergence is reached extremely fast , typically for a cutoff distance of order @xmath145 ( see results section ) . in other words , to obtain @xmath146 , in 1d we typically have to solve a system of @xmath147 or so inhomogeneous equations , which can be done very efficiently .",
    "higher dimensions imply larger systems , but overall the numerical task is still trivial and results can be obtained very fast and with little computational resources .",
    "it is important to emphasize that such low cutoffs are _ not _ inherent in the problem .",
    "in fact , one could also solve these equations , for instance , by eliminating @xmath139 to get an equation only in terms of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "if one fourier transforms this , it turns out that cutoffs as large as @xmath150 are needed before convergence is achieved , and this is especially so for the polaron+one - phonon continuum ( the bound polaron states converge quickly ) .",
    "this is not surprising , since states in the polaron+one - phonon continuum do have a free phonon , i.e. one that could be infinitely far from the polaron . in reality",
    ", we expect that if we have a finite but large enough system , all quantities will eventually converge to their bulk values .",
    "in particular , here this suggests that one needs to allow the free phonon to be hundreds of sites away from the polaron before convergence for the continuum is achieved .    the much faster convergence for the formulation of eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) is due in part to the particular choice of variable @xmath140 . even more important",
    "is the infinite summation of diagrams performed when the new frequency @xmath151 appears ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) . without this , the convergence for continuum energies remains slow and large cutoffs are needed .",
    "examples are discussed in the results section .    of course , one could also attempt to solve these equations directly in the @xmath53-space . without having",
    "tried it , we believe this to be an inefficient approach . the goal is to find @xmath152 , _ i.e. _ an average over the brillouin zone . within ma@xmath10 , @xmath153 ( it is a constant in ma ) .",
    "presuming that @xmath139 is not too different , it is clear that these functions are of comparable size everywhere in the brillouin zone , and therefore one should sample many points in the brillouin zone to obtain an accurate average .    finally , going back to eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) , we would like to point out that if we set the cutoff at zero distance , i.e. use @xmath154 , we obtain an analytical , momentum - independent approximation to the true @xmath155 : @xmath156 where @xmath157 one can think of this as the variant of ma@xmath11 that keeps some of the free propagators of energy @xmath88 exactly ( typically those appearing in non - crossed diagrams ) , but averages over those that give momentum dependence to the self - energy .",

    "improvements are observed for all other sets of parameters ( not shown ) analyzed in ref .",
    ", however for higher @xmath169 ratios ma is much more accurate to begin with , so the supplementary improvements due to ma@xmath10 and ma@xmath11 are comparatively smaller .",
