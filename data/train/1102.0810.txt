    ", @xcite argued that the pulsar signal encounters strongly scattering turbulent regions for longer lines of sight , essentially arguing that the statistics , as sampled by a pulsar signal , are nonstationary .",
    "considering the pulse shape in time , @xcite is unable to match observations with a gaussian model of scintillation unless the scattering region is confined to @xmath12 of the line of sight between the pulsar and earth .",
    "these assumptions may have physical basis , since the ism may not be statistically stationary , being composed of different regions with varying turbulence intensity @xcite .",
    "the theory of @xcite takes a different approach to explain the anomalous @xmath11 scaling by considering lvy statistics for the density difference ( defined below ) .",
    "lvy distributions are characterized by long tails with no defined moments greater than first - order [ i.e. , @xmath6 is undefined for a lvy distribution ] .",

    ", the density gradient enters the ray tracing equations [ eqns .",
    "( 7 ) in @xcite ] , and is seen to be central to determining the resultant pulsar signal shape and width .",
    "this formulation of a scintillation theory does not require the distribution of @xmath14 to be gaussian or to have a second - order moment .",
    "the notion that the density difference is characterized by a lvy distribution is a constraint on dynamical models for electron density fluctuations in the ism .",
    "consequently the question of how a lvy distribution can arise in electron density fluctuations assumes considerable importance in understanding the ism .",
    "previous work has laid the groundwork for answering this question .",
    "it has been established that electron density fluctuations associated with interstellar magnetic turbulence undergo a significant change in character near the scale @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ion sound gyroradius @xcite .   at larger scales",
    ", electron density is passively advected by the turbulent flow of an mhd cascade mediated by nonlinear shear alfvn waves @xcite .   at smaller scales",
    "the electron density becomes compressive and the turbulent energy is carried into a cascade mediated by kinetic alfvn waves ( kaw ) @xcite .",
    "the kaw cascade brings electron density into equipartition with the magnetic field , allowing for a significant increase in amplitude .",
    "the conversion to a kaw cascade has been observed in numerical solutions of the gyrokinetic equations @xcite , and is consistent with observations from solar wind turbulence @xcite .",
    "importantly , it puts large amplitude electron density fluctuations ( and large amplitude density gradients ) at the gyroradius scale ( @xmath20 cm ) , a desirable set of conditions for pulsar scintillation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to consider whether large - amplitude non - gaussian structures can arise in kaw turbulence .",
    "this question has been partially answered in a study of current filament formation in decaying kaw turbulence @xcite .   in numerical solutions to a two - field model with broadband gaussian initial conditions large amplitude current filaments spontaneously arose .",
    "each filament was associated with a large - amplitude electron density structure , circular in cross - section , that persisted in time .",
    "these electron density structures were not as localized as the corresponding current filaments , but were coherent and not mixed by surrounding turbulence .",
    "the observation of large amplitude current filaments is similar to the large - amplitude vortex filaments found in decaying 2d hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "counterparts of such structures in 3d are predicted to be the dominant component for higher order structure functions @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that a nonlinear refractive magnetic shear mechanism prevents the structures from mixing with turbulence .",
    "radial shear in the azimuthally directed magnetic field associated with each large - amplitude current filament decreases the radial correlation length of the turbulent eddies and enhances the decorrelation rate .",
    "eddies are unable to persist long enough to penetrate the shear boundary layer and disrupt the structure core .",
    "the structure persistence mechanism allows large - amplitude fluctuations to persist for many eddy - turnover times .",
    "as the turbulent decays these structures eventually dominate the statistics of the system .",
    "the spatial structure of the density field associated with localized circularly symmetric current filaments was shown from analytical theory @xcite to yield a lvy - distributed density gradient field .",
    "the kurtosis for the current field was significantly larger than the gaussian - valued kurtosis of 3 , indicating enhanced tails .",
    "the electron density and magnetic field kurtosis values were not significantly greater than 3 .",
    "however , just as the current is non - gaussian when the magnetic field is not , it is expected that numerical solutions should show non - gaussian behavior for the density gradient .   in the present paper ,",
    "density gradient statistics are measured and found to be non - gaussian .   rather than relying on kurtosis values alone , the probability density functions ( pdfs )",
    "are computed from ensembles of numerical solutions , showing non - gaussian pdfs for the density gradient field .",
    "the previous studies of filament generation in kaw turbulence leave significant unanswered questions relating to structure morphology and its effect on scintillation .",
    "it is well established that mhd turbulence admits structures that are both filament - like and sheet - like .",
    "can sheet - like structures arise in kaw turbulence ?",
    "if so , what are the conditions or parameters favoring one type of structure versus the other ?   if sheet - like structures dominate in some circumstances , what are the statistics of the density gradient ?",
    "can they be sufficiently non - gaussian to be compatible with pulsar scintillation scaling ?",
    "it is desirable to consider such questions prior to calculation of rf wave scattering properties in the density gradient fields obtained from numerical solutions .    in this paper , we show that both current filaments and current sheet structures naturally arise in numerical solutions of a decaying kaw turbulence model .",
    "each has a structure of the same type and at the same location in the electron density gradient .",
    "these structures become prevalent as the numerical solutions progress in time , and each is associated with highly non - gaussian pdfs .",
    "moreover , we show that small - scale current filaments and current sheets , along with their associated density structures , are highly sensitive to the magnitude of resistive damping and diffusive damping of density fluctuations .",
    "current filaments persist provided that resistivity @xmath21 is small ; similarly , electron density fluctuations and gradients are diminished by large diffusive damping in the electron continuity equation .",
    "the latter results from collisions assuming density fluctuations are subject to a fick s law for diffusion .",
    "the magnitude of the resistivity affects ( 1 ) whether current filaments can become large in amplitude , ( 2 ) their spatial scale , and ( 3 ) the preponderance of these filaments as compared to sheets .",
    "the magnitude of the diffusive damping parameter , @xmath22 , similarly influences the amplitude of density gradients and , to a lesser degree , influences the extent to which electron density structures are non - localized .    in the ism resistive and diffusive damping become important near resistive scales .",
    "however , it is well known that collisionless damping effects are also present @xcite , and quite possibly dominate over collisional damping in larger scales near the ion larmor radius .",
    "the collisional damping in the present work is understood as a heuristic approach that facilitates analysis of the effects of different damping regimes on the statistics of electron density fluctuations . by varying the ratio of resistive and diffusive",
    "damping we can , as suggested above , control the type of structure present in the turbulence .",
    "this allows us to isolate and study the statistics associated with each type of structure .",
    "it also allows us to assess and examine the type of environment conducive to formation of the structure .",
    "we consider regimes with large and small damping parameters , enabling us to explore damping effects on structure formation across a range from inertial to dissipative .",
    "future work will address collisionless damping in greater detail .",
    "the coherent structures observed in numerical solutions of decaying kaw turbulence , whether elongated sheets or localized filaments , are similar to structures observed in decaying mhd turbulence , as in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the flow field initially gives rise to sheet - like structures .",
    "after selective decay of the velocity field energy , the system evolves into a state with sheets and filaments . during the merger of like - signed filaments ,",
    "large - amplitude sheets arise , limited to the region between the merging filaments .",
    "these short - lived sheets exist in addition to the long - lived sheets not associated with the merger of filaments . in the two - field kaw system , however , there is no flow ; the sheet and filament generation is due to a different mechanism , of which the filament generation has previously been discussed @xcite .",
    "other work @xcite observed the spontaneous generation of current sheets and filaments in numerical solutions , with both orszag - tang vortex and randomized initial conditions .",
    "these 2d reduced mhd numerical solutions modeled the evolution of magnetic flux and vorticity with collisional dissipation coefficients @xmath21 , the resistivity , and @xmath23 , the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath24 , was set to unity .",
    "these systems are incompressible and not suitable for modeling the kaw system we consider here  they do however illustrate the ubiquity of current sheets and filaments , and serve as points of comparison . for orszag - tang - like initial conditions with large - scale flux tubes smooth in profile , current sheets are preferred at the interfaces between tubes .",
    "tearing instabilities can give rise to filamentary current structures that persist for long times , but the large - scale and smoothness of flux tubes do not give rise to strong current filaments localized at the center of the tubes . to see this ,",
    "consider a given flux tube , and model it as cylindrically symmetric and monotonically decreasing in @xmath25 with characteristic radial extent @xmath26 ,    @xmath27     for @xmath28 .",
    "the current is localized at the center with magnitude    @xmath29     thus flux tubes with large radial extent @xmath26 have a corresponding small current filament at their center .",
    "hence , initial conditions dominated by a few large - scale flux tubes are not expected to have large amplitude current filaments at the flux tube centers , but favor current sheet formation and filaments associated with tearing instabilities in those sheet regions . at x",
    "points current sheet folding and filamentary structures can arise ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) , but these regions are small in area compared to the quiescent flux - tube regions .",
    "note that if , instead of orszag - tang - like initial conditions , the initial state is random , one expects some regions with flux tubes that have @xmath26 small , and therefore a sizable current filament at the center .",
    "consider now the effect of comparatively large or small @xmath21 . in the case of large @xmath21 , the central region of a flux tube",
    "is smoothed by the collisional damping , thus having a strong suppressive effect on the amplitude of the current filament associated with such a flux tube .",
    "large - amplitude current structures are localized to the interfaces between flux tubes . in the process of mergers between like",
    "- signed filaments ( and repulsion between unlike - signed ) , large current sheets are generated at these interfaces , similar to the large - amplitude sheets generated in mhd turbulence during mergers @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath21 , relatively little suppression of isolated current filaments should occur ; if these filaments are spatially separated owning to the buffer provided by their associated flux tube , they can be expected to survive a long time and only be disrupted upon the merger with another large - scale flux tube .",
    "large @xmath21 , then , allows current sheets to form at the boundaries between flux tubes while suppressing the spatially - separated current filaments at flux tube centers .",
    "small @xmath21 allows interface sheets and spatially separated filaments to exist .",
    "these simple arguments suggest that the evolution of the large - amplitude structures and their interaction with turbulence is thus strongly influenced by the damping parameters .",
    "as such , the magnitudes of the damping parameters are expected to affect the resultant pulsar scintillation scalings .",
    "the present paper considers the effect of variations of these damping parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the kaw model",
    ", the ( unnormalized ) resistivity takes the form @xmath30 and the density diffusion coefficient is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the electron mass , @xmath33 is the electron collision frequency , @xmath34 is the electron density , @xmath35 is the electron charge , and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the electron thermal velocity , and @xmath38 the electron gyrofrequency . the ratio of these terms , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the ratio of plasma to magnetic pressures .",
    "when we vary this ratio , as we will do in the numerical solutions presented here , we have in mind that we are representing regions of different @xmath41 .",
    "however , as a practical matter in the numerical solutions , we must vary the damping parameters independently of the variation of @xmath41 , since the kinetic alfvn wave dynamics require a small @xmath41 to propagate . for the warm ionized medium ,",
    "typical parameters are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xcite . with these parameters ,",
    "the plasma @xmath41 formally ranges from @xmath46 , spanning a range of plasma magnetization .",
    "we present the results of numerical solutions of decaying kaw turbulence to ascertain the effect of different damping regimes on the statistics of the fields of interest , in particular the electron density and electron density gradient . in the @xmath47 regime",
    "( using normalized parameters ) , previous work @xcite had large - amplitude current filaments that were strongly localized with no discernible electron density structures ( @xmath22 was large to preserve numerical stability ) .",
    "this regime is unable to preserve density structures or density gradients .",
    "the numerical solutions presented here have @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; in each limit the damping parameters are minimized so as to allow structure formation to occur , and are large enough to ensure numerical stability for the duration of each numerical solution .",
    "we investigate the statistics of both filaments and sheets in the context of scintillation in the warm ionized medium .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section [ sec : kaw - model ] gives an overview of the kaw model and normalizations , its regime of validity , and its dispersion relation .",
    "section [ sec : numerical - solution ] discusses the numerical method used and the field initializations .",
    "the negligible effect of initial cross - correlation between fields is discussed .",

    "the tendency of density structures to align with magnetic field structures regardless of initial conditions indicates that the initial conditions are representative of fully - developed turbulence . after a small number of alfvn times the memory of the initial state",

    "we would expect the density gradients to be non - gaussian when using parameters that correspond to the ism .",
    "future work will address the pulsar width scaling using electron density fields from the numerical solution .",
    "the non - gaussian distributions presented here are strongly tied to the fact that the system is decaying and that circular intermittent structures are preserved from nonlinear interaction .",
    "one can show that , in the kaw system , circularly symmetric structures ( or filaments ) are force free in eqs.([psi - eqn ] ) and ( [ den - eqn ] ) , i.e. , the nonlinearity is zero .",

    "new structures would arise from large amplitude regions whenever the radial magnetic field shear were large enough to preserve the structure from interaction with turbulence .",
    "one could define a structure - replenishing rate from the driving terms that would depend on the energy injection rate and scale of injection .",
    "the non - gaussian measures for a driven system would be characterized by a competition between the creation of new structures through the injection of energy at large scales and the annihilation of structures by mergers or by erosion from continuously replenished small - scale turbulence .",
    "if erosion effects dominate , the kurtosis excess is maintained at gaussian values , diminishing the pdf tails relative to a lvy distribution .",
    "if replenishing effects dominate , however , the enhancement of the tails of the density gradient pdf may be observed in a driven system as it is observed in the present decaying system .",
    "we note that structure function scaling in hydrodynamic turbulence is consistent with the replenishing effects becoming more dominant relative to erosion effects as scales become smaller , i.e. , the turbulence is more intermittent at smaller scales .",
    "the large range of scales in interstellar turbulence and the conversion of mhd fluctuations to kinetic alfvn fluctuations at small scales both support the notion that the structures of the decaying system are relevant to interstellar turbulence at the scales of kaw excitations .",
    "this scenario is consistent with arguments suggested by @xcite .",
    "they propose a turbulent cascade in the solar wind that injects energy into the kaw regime , counteracting landau damping at scales near the ion larmor radius . by doing",
    "so they can account for enhanced small - scale density fluctuations and observed scintillation effects in interplanetary scintillation .",
    "we also observe that , although the numerical solutions presented here are decaying in time , the decay rate decreases in absolute value for later times ( figs .",
    "[ energy - time - correlated ] and [ energy - time - uncorrelated ] ) , approximating a steady - state configuration .",
    "the kurtosis excess ( figs.[kurtosis - correlated ] and [ kurtosis - uncorrelated ] ) for the density gradient field is statistically stationary after a brief startup period . despite the decaying character of the numerical solutions , they suggest that the density gradient field would be non - gaussian in the driven case .",
    "the kurtosis excess  a measure of a field s spatial intermittency  is itself intermittent in time .",
    "the large spikes in kurtosis excess correspond to rare events involving the merger of two large - amplitude structures , usually filaments .",
    "a large - amplitude short - lived sheet grows between the structures and persists throughout the merger , gaining amplitude in time until the point of merger .",
    "the kurtosis excess during this merger event is dominated by the single large - amplitude sheet between the merging structures .",
    "this would likely be the region of dominant scattering for scintillation , since a corresponding large - amplitude density gradient structure exists in this region as well .",
    "the temporal intermittency of kurtosis excess suggests that these mergers are rare and hence , of low probability .",
    "the heuristic picture of long undeviated lvy flights punctuated by large angular deviations could apply to these merger sheets .",
    "decaying kinetic alfvn wave turbulence is shown to yield non - gaussian electron density gradients , consistent with non - gaussian distributed density gradients inferred from pulsar width scaling with distance to source . with small resistivity ,",
    "large - amplitude current filaments form spontaneously from gaussian initial conditions , and these filaments are spatially correlated with stable electron density structures . the electron density field , while gaussian throughout the numerical solution , has gradients that are strongly non - gaussian .",
    "ensemble statistics for current and density gradient fields confirm the kurtosis measurements for individual runs .",
    "density gradient statistics , when compared to current statistics , have more enhanced tails , even though both these fields are a single derivative away from electron density and magnetic field , respectively , which are in equipartition and gaussian distributed throughout the numerical solution .",
    "when all damping is placed in resistive diffusion ( @xmath125 regime ) , filamentary structures give way to sheet - like structures in current , magnetic , electron density and density gradient fields .",
    "kurtosis measurements remain similar to those for the small @xmath21 case , and the field pdfs also remain largely unchanged , despite the different large - amplitude structures at play .",
    "the kind of structures that emerge , whether filaments or sheets , is a function of the damping parameters . with @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "minimal to preserve numerical stability and of comparable value , the decaying kaw system tends to form filamentary current structures with associated larger - scale magnetic and density structures , all generally circularly symmetric and long - lived .",
    "each filament is associated with a flux tube and can be well separated from the surrounding turbulence .",
    "sheets exist in this regime as well , and they are localized to the interface between flux tubes . with @xmath21 small and @xmath140 , the system is in a sheet - dominated regime .",
    "both regimes have density gradients that are non - gaussian with large kurtosis .",
    "the effects on pulsar signal scintillation in each regime have yet to be ascertained directly .",
    "the conventional picture of a lvy flight is a random walk with step sizes distributed according to a long - tailed distribution with no defined variance .",
    "this gives rise to long , uninterrupted flights punctuated by large scattering events .",
    "this is in contrast to a normally - distributed random walk with relatively uniform step sizes and small scattering events .",
    "the intermittent filaments that arise in the small @xmath21 and @xmath22 regime are suggestive of structures that could scatter pulsar signals through large angles , however the associated density structures are broadened in comparison to the current filament and would not give rise to as large a scattering event .",
    "even broadened structures can yield lvy distributed density gradients @xcite , but it is not clear how the lvy flight picture can be applied to these broad density gradient structures . in the @xmath124 regime , the large - aspect - ratio sheets may serve to provide the necessary scatterings through refraction and may map well onto the lvy flight model .",
    "an alternative possibility , suggested by the _",
    "temporal _ intermittency of the kurtosis ( itself a measure of a field s _ spatial _ intermittency ) , is the encounter between the pulsar signal and a short - lived sheet that arises during the merger of two filamentary structures .",

    "they are the dominant structure in the numerical solution .",
