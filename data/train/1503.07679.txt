    "a maximally symmetric solution in our model is compactification of the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 dimensional minkowski spacetime and @xmath53 is a two dimensional sphere , as in the work of randjbar - daemi , salam and strathdee ( rss ) @xcite where @xmath54 is considered .",
    "we consider the solution for flat @xmath55 dimensional spacetime and study its classical stability in this section , though other maximally symmetric spacetimes are also interesting .",
    "our notation is that the suffices @xmath56 run over @xmath57 and the suffices @xmath58 are used for the extra dimensions @xmath55 and @xmath59 .",
    "as stated in the previous section , the solution of @xmath17 and @xmath60 is a solution in our model . a suitable ansatz for the flux field is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the antisymmetric symbol and the constant @xmath63 is the strength of the two - form flux .",
    "this monopole flux yields the relation @xmath64    then , the equation @xmath17 can be decomposed to @xmath65 for the spacetime of a direct product . as for the flat @xmath55 dimensional spacetime ,",
    "where @xmath66 , we must take a fine - tuning of parameters as @xmath67 and therefore , the solution for the background fields reads @xmath68    substituting this compactified background solution into eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) , we obtain @xmath69    to show complete particle spectrum for the ghost field is rather complicated , but we can see that the lowest mass - squared of the ghost is @xmath70 for symmetric tensor fields ( which do not couples to the ricci curvature of the extra space ) and vector bosons of the kaluza - klein origin ( which come from the zero modes of the lichnerowicz operator on @xmath53 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that the other graviton and vector field fluctuations is absent in the linearized equation ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "thus , taking the analysis by rss for other fluctuation modes @xcite into account , in the classical and linearized analysis , we find that the rss background solution @xmath50 is stable if @xmath72 , because there is no growing mode .    before closing this section",
    ", we note that the effective @xmath55 dimensional newton constant , which can be found by the coefficient of the ricci scalar of the @xmath55 dimensional spacetime in the action , is not affected by the higher order terms in our model and is independent of @xmath73 .",

    ", @xmath74 can be indefinitely negative provided that @xmath93 . in this case , the @xmath0 dimensional cosmological constant becomes negative .",
    "this may not indicate instability of compactification against a large fluctuation , because the higher derivative terms cause the coupling between the compactification scale and the first and second derivatives of an expanding scale factor of the rest of space .",

    "our toy models seem to be quite special , but the analysis of the models will exhibit some typical behaviors including inflation , and we can regard general higher order corrections as a modification from the critical models .",
    "the subjects we should consider are , for instance : the coupling to matter fields ; compactifications on @xmath162 @xcite in our models ; the inclusion of a @xmath163-form flux field such as the freund  rubin compactification @xcite ; the treatment of our models in quantum cosmology @xcite ; the initial singularity problems @xcite in the models ; the possible supersymmetrization of the models ; the field content of the model in @xmath164 dimensions .    the generalization of our model  1 to more higher order theory is considered straightforwardly .",
    "if we introduce an auxiliary field @xmath165 , the additional term can be replaced by @xmath166 which will be studied extensively elsewhere .    finally , we must research the relation to other theories .",
    "we suppose that the structure of the model  1 owes to the matrix @xmath167 , which appears also in the spin - two propagator",
    ". it would be very interesting if our models were the effective theory of another theory .",
