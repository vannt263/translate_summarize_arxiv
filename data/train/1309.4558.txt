    "the additional modulation parameter and the momentum permit us to define a topological invariant in the extended 2d parameter space to distinguish different topological phases , which gives rise to a phase diagram similar to that of the 2d haldane s model . the topologically nontrivial edge states in our model may be observed in photonic crystal systems .",
