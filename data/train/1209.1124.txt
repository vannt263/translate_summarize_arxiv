    "although the inflationary scenario still maintains its status of the paradigm in cosmology , there is an increasing interest in the alternative proposal of models displaying a bounce @xcite .",
    "this means the possible existence of a collapsing era prior to the actual expanding phase .",
    "one of the main differences of these two proposals concerns the behavior of small perturbations and its evolution from a perfect spatially homogeneous phase to the production of inhomogeneities .",
    "there are hopes , due to a through analysis of these processes @xcite , that this question will be settled in the near future .",
    "another important point in favor of bouncing models is that they avoid the problem of initial singularity .",
    "the present paper examines one of these scenarios which the dynamical history of the universe is partial controlled by a magnetic field .",
    "it is analyzed its main effects and its compatibility with actual observations .",
    "the main hypothesis of this model concerns the non - linearity character of magnetic field .",
    "the effects of a nonlinear electromagnetic theory in a cosmological setting have been studied in several articles @xcite and for different reasons .",
    "for example , in @xcite the non - linearity is responsible to avoid the initial singularity , and in @xcite the non - linearity is accountable for generate the recent acceleration . in these two papers",
    "the framework is the same : a cosmological magnetic field governed by a nonlinear electromagnetic theory is responsible by the desirable effects .",
    "recently , these two effects were combined generating a cyclic cosmological toy model @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is improve this model and investigate how realistic it can be .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the standard cosmological model unavoidably leads to a singular behavior of the curvature invariants in what has been termed the big bang .",
    "on the other hand , there are some evidences that point in the direction that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite . in principle , these two problems have no simple connection and thus does not have a unique combined solution .",
    "it should be tempted to try to unify these two questions in a single model .",
    "it will be shown that in the framework of a magnetic universe these two problems are solved at once .    in general ,",
    "the cyclic cosmological models can be divided in two classes : those which generate the cyclic behavior with non - conventional matter fields @xcite , and those which produce the cyclicity through of extension of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the model proposed here belongs to the first class where the non - conventional matter is represented by a non - linear magnetic field .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii presents the notion of the magnetic universe and its generic features . in section iii",
    "it is fitted or constrained the five independent parameters presents in this models .",
    "the section iv presents the complete scenario consisting of the five eras .",
    "the paper ends in section v with some generic final comments .",
    "moreover , it is presented in the appendix a a brief review about the average procedure and in appendix b a discussion about the model stability .",
    "to construct a realistic magnetic universe we start assuming that the universe is composed by the five fluids namely baryonic matter , cold dark matter , neutrinos , radiation and a cosmological magnetic field .",
    "the first four fluids will be treated in the standard way .",
    "thus baryonic and dark matter are modeling by non - relativistic fluids ( zero pressure ) , and neutrinos and radiation are featured as ultra - relativistic fluid ( the mass of neutrinos is neglected ) .",
    "the fifth fluid , the magnetic field , will be described by the lagrangian for the non - linear electrodynamics given by    @xmath0    where the dimensional constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 are to be determined by observation .",
    "the nonlinear terms can be interpreted as a phenomenological approach . but a more interesting and fundamental scenario is suppose these terms represent a classical interpretation of vacuum polarization .",
    "indeed , heseinberg , schwinger and others showed that quantum corrections due vacuum polarization changes the classical lagrangian introducing nonlinear terms @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that the five fluids are independent .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field enter in cosmological scenario through the average procedure described in appendix a. by construction , the average of the electric part of the cosmological electromagnetic field must vanishes , i.e. @xmath3 . and in this case , each term of @xmath4 becomes cosmological independent in the sense that each one behaves as a non - interacting perfect fluid ( for details see @xcite ) .    treating baryonic matter and dark matter as a single fluid and neutrinos and radiation as another single fluid , the magnetic universe is completely featured for six independent components . in this context , the total energy density and the total pressure is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6    the real evolution of the universe depends on the values of the six constants presents in ( [ densidades ] ) .",
    "however , at least in a qualitative manner , it is possible to distinguish five distinct cosmological stages just looking the form of the terms in ( [ densidades ] ) .",
    "these five stages are :    * the bouncing era : this era is governed by @xmath7 and it dominates in the earliest universe ( before nucleosynthesis ) . in bouncing era",
    "the scale factor reaches a minimum value . *",
    "the radiation era : this era is governed by @xmath8 with @xmath9 . during this epoch occurs the primordial nucleosynthesis . *",
    "the matter era : this era is dominated by @xmath10with @xmath11 . it is expected that the structure formation occurs in this epoch . * the acceleration era : in this period @xmath12 govern the cosmic evolution .",
    "the term @xmath13 becomes negative and the universe begins to accelerate .",
    "* the re - bouncing era : this era is dominated by @xmath14 . the term @xmath13 becomes positive once more and starts a new decelerated phase . after a while ,",
    "the @xmath15 reach a maximum and re - bounces entering in a collapsing phase .    in the section [ sec - comsce ]",
    ", it will be shown explicitly that the universe pass through of all the five stages .",
    "in order to analyze the complete scenario it is necessary to determine six constants where only five are independent . ] .",
    "although five independent constants are a elevated number of free parameters , this model describes all the evolution for the universe , since the bounce until the re - bounce .",
    "it keeps untouchable the main successes of the standard big bang model ( primordial nucleosynthesis , cmb generation , etc ) and solve some other problems like the initial singularity , the present acceleration and the big rip .",
    "the six parameters are divided in two distinct classes : the first one , represented by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , acts on the primordial universe ; and the second one , represented by @xmath2 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , affects only the recent universe . because this difference , each class must be fixed by independent manner .",
    "let s start with the primordial constants .      in this subsection",
    "it will be fixed or constrained the three primordial parameters namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the most simple to determine is @xmath21 , so let 's start with it .",
    "the constant @xmath18 represents the nowadays energy density for the all ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "it is basically composed of radiation @xmath22 and neutrinos @xmath23 . for radiation",
    ", the precisely cmb measurement @xcite shows that ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 .",
    "theoretical considerations for a massless neutrinos @xcite imply in    @xmath26    therefore , the nowadays ultra - relativistic energy density is    @xmath27    the next parameter it should be fix is @xmath17 . as could be seen in ( densidades ) , the constant @xmath17 acts directly only in the primordial universe through @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , its numerical value is necessary to determine the @xmath16 , @xmath19 and @xmath2 constants .",
    "thus , @xmath29 affects not only the primordial universe but also , in the indirectly way , the present universe .",
    "physically the parameter @xmath17 is related with a cosmological magnetic field . supposing the existence of a large scale magnetic field , its background mean value @xmath30 must be @xmath31 @xmath32 @xcite . in the @xmath33 system , the energy density related with this magnetic field is    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is just a parametrization ( @xmath36 ) .    on the other hand , the present energy density for the cosmological magnetic field @xmath37 is given by    @xmath38    so , the comparison between the last equation and ( [ ene_mag ] ) results in    @xmath39    replacing ( [ b0 ^ 2 ] ) and ( [ rho_ur0 ] ) in ( [ densidades ] ) a first relevant result arises : @xmath40 is always subdominant , i.e. the maxwell term concerning to cosmological magnetic field is not important to the universe evolution .",
    "in fact , even the actual cosmological experiments including cmb anisotropy observation performed by wmap satellite do not have accuracy to measure a cosmological magnetic field . perhaps , the future experiments of cmb anisotropy ( e.g. planck satellite ) are able to detected it .",
    "the last parameter necessary to fix is @xmath16",
    ". this parameter rules the bouncing stage , hence it is concerning at the very early universe .",
    "these features make difficult to precisely determine @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , instead of to fix it we just establish a range of validity for @xmath16 .",
    "the maximum and minimum allowed values are obtained through of two physical conditions : the bounce must occurs considerably before primordial nucleosynthesis but it should not extrapolate the validity of classical gravitation .",
    "the first condition implies in @xmath41 i.e. ,    @xmath42    replacing ( [ rho_ur0 ] ) and ( [ b0 ^ 2 ] ) in the last equation it follows @xmath43 where the scale factor was converted to temperature through of the relation @xmath44 .    using @xmath45 and supposing that the nucleosynthesis took place around @xmath46 @xmath47 we finally obtain @xmath48    for consistence with second condition the bounce should happen below the planck scale , i.e. @xmath49 . in this model , the bouncing occurs when @xmath50 which implies in @xmath51 so , @xmath52 and hence @xmath53    at last , using ( [ max_lim ] ) and ( [ min_lim ] ) , it is obtained the range of validity for the parameter @xmath16 :    @xmath54    the term @xmath55 at the lagrangian could be interpreted as an one - loop quantum correction in the infrared regime .",
    "indeed , it correction was obtained first by euler - heisenberg @xcite . in this context ,",
    "@xmath56 values    @xmath57    comparing ( [ eh ] ) with ( [ num_alfa ] ) it could be seen that the both results are consistent .",
    "so , in this scenario , the bouncing stage was generated by quantum electrodynamics effects .      in this subsection",
    ", we intend to determine the three remain constants namely @xmath58 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "differently for the three previous parameters , these constants are relevant at the same time ( present universe ) . for this reason",
    ", they should be set simultaneously .",
    "the procedure that was adopted is based on the fit of the model using supernova data .",
    "this procedure concerns only to recent universe , so it could be neglected the terms @xmath59 , @xmath8 and @xmath40 . in this case",
    ", the luminosity distance @xmath60 is written as @xmath61 where the hubble function @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 with the three @xmath64 s defined as @xmath65 for @xmath66 , ( [ h_z ] ) implies in @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for the present universe , the model has only two free parameters .",
    "the set of snia which was used in the fit is the union set @xcite .",
    "this set collects the mainly sets of supernovas which was obtained during the last twelve years .",
    "it is constituted of 414 sn divided in 13 sub - sets where all of them were analyzed through of the same procedure . based on this procedure ,",
    "the authors excluded 107 sn , so only 307 supernovas were regarded true standard candles .",
    "it is with these 307 sn which is fitted the two parameters .",
    "the supernova data are usually assumed as gaussian , hence it could be used the statistical likelihood method to determine the free parameters .",
    "the standard procedure consist in to build and minimize a @xmath68 through the fit of the model s parameter .",
    "following the steps point out in union , let s start the construction of @xmath68 regarding only the statistical errors :    @xmath69 ^{2}}{\\sum% \\limits_{jk}c_{jk}e_{j}e_{k}+\\sigma _ { tot}^{2}+\\sigma _ { int}^{2 } } , \\label{chi^2 geral}\\ ] ]    with @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the @xmath73-band peak magnitude , @xmath74 is the absolute magnitude , @xmath75 represents the stretch in supernova lightcurve , @xmath76 represents the color variation between @xmath73 and @xmath77 bands , @xmath16 is the stretch parameter , @xmath19 is the color parameter and @xmath78 is a additive factor which include constants like @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80 matrix is the statistical covariant matrix , @xmath81 is related with astrophysical dispersion and @xmath82 represents the intrinsical dispersion .",
    "the term @xmath83 represents the uncertainties associated with @xmath84 and @xmath76 where @xmath85 . in principle @xmath86 and @xmath87 are free parameters which must be fitted for each specific cosmological model .",
    "nevertheless , the authors in @xcite found out that @xmath86 and @xmath87 are almost independent of cosmological parameters .",
    "so , it is assumed that @xmath86 and @xmath19 are constants , the uncertainties of @xmath84 and @xmath76 could be directly passed to @xmath88 . in this case , the @xmath68 is written as @xmath89where the parameter @xmath74 was embedded in @xmath78 . in @xcite is available the list with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for each one of the 307 snia .",
    "beside @xmath92 , there are other three gaussian sources of uncertainties : the first one is the dispersion due gravitational lensing , the second one is the uncertainty in the milk - way dust extinction correction and the last one is the uncertainty due peculiar velocity in the host galaxy .",
    "* gravitational lensing decreases the mode of the brightness distribution and causes increased dispersion in the hubble diagram at high red - shift @xcite .",
    "the both strong and weak leasing effects engender a dispersion of @xmath93 in magnitude @xcite , and if the statistical of snia is large enough this uncertainty could be considered as a gaussian error . *",
    "all the snia light - curve data were corrected for extinction caused by our galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , these corrections contain statistical and systematic errors which act directly on the magnitude value .",
    "these statistical uncertainties will be neglected because three reasons : they only concern the sn with @xmath94 , and these ones represent approximately @xmath95 of total set ; out of galactic plane these uncertainties value as a rule @xmath96 ; the implementation of these uncertainties is very complicated because the extinction and its errors change with the galactic coordinates .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are treated later on . * as point out in several papers @xcite ,",
    "the peculiar velocity in the host galaxy causes a error @xmath97 which varies between @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100 . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "so , the uncertainty propagated to magnitude due the peculiar velocities is @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "these three sources of uncertainty are encapsulated in @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the discussion above results in @xmath105    the last source of statistical error which was considered is the uncertainty produced by an intrinsical dispersion @xmath82 .",
    "this intrinsical dispersion is related about non corrected and/or unknown errors .    to estimate @xmath82 it",
    "is performed a first fit with a small initial value ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "then it is determined a new @xmath82 imposing @xmath107 .",
    "and the last step consists in perform the same routine once more to obtain a more accurate and definitive @xmath82 . during this procedure",
    "it is not used @xmath81 because the intrinsical dispersion is related only with the `` main '' data namely @xmath108 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are introduced at the same way which was performed in @xcite .",
    "the method consists in to introduce a gaussian distribution with a @xmath109 parameter for each present systematic uncertainty @xmath110 .",
    "the new parameters get in additively in the modulus of distance , i. e. @xmath111 and the previous likelihood changes to @xmath112 where @xmath113    in this kind of construction , we are supposing that a specific source of systematic error leads to a `` variation '' in the modulus of distance",
    ". and the importance of its variation is determined through of a gaussian distribution where the standard deviation is identified with the systematic uncertainty .    at the union set , there are two kinds of systematic errors : one which depends on the specific sub - set ( e. g. due to observational effects ) and the other which concerns to all set of supernovas ( e. g. due to astrophysical or fundamental calibration effects ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties common to all samples can be absorbed in the definition of absolute magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , it is expected a difference between the nearby ( @xmath114 ) and distant ( @xmath115 ) supernovas .",
    "so , we can cast the common systematic uncertainties to a uncertainty in the difference @xmath116 between absolute magnitudes of close and distant sns . following the steps discussed in union , it is defined @xmath117 as the point which splits the sns in nearby and farther objects . beside @xmath116",
    ", we introduce a set of 13 parameters @xmath109 which represents the systematic uncertainties for each one of the 13 sub - sets .    the complete likelihood for the model",
    "is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 \\right .",

    "thus , comparing ( [ chi^2 esta ] ) with ( [ chi_completo ] ) it follows that @xmath122 .",
    "the systematic errors arise from seven distinct sources :    * errors due the fixation of @xmath86 and @xmath87 parameters .",
    "* errors due the possible samples contamination .",
    "* errors due the models of supernovas light curve and @xmath123-corrections .",
    "* error due photometric zero point calibration . *",
    "error due a possible variation of malmquist bias with the red - shift .",
    "* systematic errors due gravitational lensing effects . *",
    "systematic error due the normalization in the corrections for galactic extinction maps .",
    "taking account all these effects , the authors of @xcite reached the following uncertainties : @xmath124so , the error related with each one of the 13 sub - sets are the same .",
    "first , we take account only the statistical uncertainties . using the data",
    "presents in @xcite , it is performed a numerical calculation to determine the cosmological parameters .",
    "the procedure could be summarized in five steps :    1 .   construction of @xmath125 not taking account @xmath81 .",
    "2 .   marginalization of @xmath78 parameter .",
    "3 .   calculation of @xmath82 .",

    "thus , @xmath133    the next step is to include the systematic uncertainties in the procedure .",
    "analogously to the first case , it is performed an analytic marginalization at the non - cosmological parameters namely @xmath134 , @xmath116 and the set of @xmath109 .",

    "this issue is directly related with model stability ( see appendix b ) and it will be subject of future investigations .      for the present , the friedmann equations could be approximated by , @xmath202 \\label{fried rb1}\\ ] ] and @xmath203 \\label{fried rb2}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 s are defined in ( [ omega_definitions ] ) .",
    "the conditions for re - bouncing are given by @xmath204    unlike the equations of bounce , the equations above could not be solved analytically .",
    "even the @xmath205 could not be express from @xmath64 s in a simple manner .",
    "nevertheless , numerical approaches allow us to study many features of this period .",
    "figure [ figura5 ] shows the numerical solution for ( [ fried rb1 ] ) .     in function of time @xmath199 in giga years .",
    "@xmath206 is chosen as the instant when the actual acceleration begins .",
    "@xmath207 corresponds to interval of time between the start of acceleration and the present time.,width=272,height=226 ]    from the numerical calculations involving ( [ fried rb1 ] ) it could be determined the maximum size for the universe @xmath208 and the time remaining to reach it @xmath209 the period of acceleration @xmath210 is obtained from ( [ fried rb2 ] ) and results in @xmath211 it started in @xmath212 billions of years ago and in terms of red - shift it begun in @xmath213    these results show that the acceleration era is almost finished , so spending another 20 million years we are entering in the re - bouncing period .      to obtain global features for this model",
    "it is necessary to solve the first friedmann equation with all terms .",
    "it is given by    @xmath214   \\label{fried_comp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath215 is always negligible .",
    "again we must use numerical methods to solve ( [ fried_comp ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ figura6 ] .     in function of time @xmath199 in giga years .",
    "@xmath206 is chosen as the instant of bounce .",
    "the three times @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 split the expansion period in three eras : matter era - @xmath219 , acceleration era - @xmath220 and re - bouncing era @xmath221 .",
    "the other two eras , radiation and bouncing eras , are too close to origin , thus it is not possible distinguish them , at least in theses scales.,width=272,height=226 ]    the plot above shows the complete evolution for one and a half cycle .",
    "this model is a eternal cosmological model , so it is meaningless to talk about the initial time and the age of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , one could determine the time passed of bounce until nowadays @xmath222 and a period to complete a cycle @xmath223 .",
    "using the solution for ( fried_comp ) it follows that @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the solution of ( [ fried_comp ] ) allows to establish the values for the scale factor at the bouncing and re - bouncing instants . in terms of @xmath226",
    "we obtain @xmath227 and @xmath228 where the maximum variation for the scale factor is @xmath229 . comparing these results with those obtained previously - equations ( [ numboun ] ) and ( [ numrboun ] ) - it verifies that both have the same numerical value .",
    "this confirms the validity of analysis made in sections sec - boun and [ sec - rboun ] .",
    "another interesting analysis which can be done is the evolution of total equation of state @xmath230 . using the relation @xmath231 we can study its evolution in terms of time . in most of the time during a complete cycle @xmath232 .",
    "this range include two long periods of deceleration ( radiation and matter eras ) and two periods of acceleration ( primordial and recent ) . however , because of features of bouncing and re - bouncing , @xmath230 must eventually assume values less than @xmath233 and values greater than @xmath46 . indeed , near to bouncing in a range @xmath234 we have @xmath235 , which means a phantom equation of state . and near to re - bouncing in a range @xmath236 we have @xmath237 , i.e. an ekpyrotic equation of state",
    "it is noteworthy that during all period of recent acceleration @xmath238 .",
    "this analysis confirm that this model is an explicit realization of a quintom cyclic scenario @xcite .",
    "in this paper it was constructed a cyclic cosmological model with five fluids namely baryonic and non - baryonic matter , radiation , neutrinos and a cosmic magnetic field described by a nonlinear electrodynamics . with five independent parameters it reproduces",
    "correctly the three expansion phases - radiation , matter and accelerate phases - and produces a bouncing and a re - bouncing stages .",
    "another important point is that the main features for the model could be analyzed splitting it in two independent phases ( primordial and actual ) with a linking phase to connected both .    in primordial phase",
    "the relevant components are the bouncing and ultra - relativistic components characterized by the constants @xmath16 and @xmath239 .",
    "the ultra - relativistic constant was fixed through cmb measurement and theoretical consideration about the neutrinos background . on the other hand ,",
    "the constant @xmath16 remains widely free .",
    "it happens because there are not much information about the pre - nucleosynthesis universe .",
    "another way to determine @xmath16 is to interpret the term @xmath240 as an one - loop quantum correction due vacuum polarization in the infrared regime @xcite . in this case , @xmath241 and this value is in complete agreement with the cosmological constraints ( see section [ sec - cpu ] ) .",
    "nowadays the relevant components are the non - relativistic matter , the acceleration and the re - bouncing terms .",
    "the three constants - @xmath137 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 - associated with each term was fixed using data of snia .",
    "figures [ figura1 ] , [ figura2 ] and figura3 show that the re - bounce probably occurs . for the complete fit , represented by figure [ figura3 ] , the non - existence of re - bouncing is excluded in @xmath244 confidence level .",
    "other important feature for this model is the high value obtained for @xmath137 compared with the standard @xmath245 model .",
    "even with a robust prior for non - relativistic matter this feature remains .",
    "i believe that it happens due the eminent deceleration engendered by the re - bouncing term .",
    "to better clarify this point , it would be important to use another cosmological tests .",
    "this possibility will be investigated in the future .    a important question concerns about the evolution of energy density fluctuations .",
    "as point out in section [ sec - boun ] , the model not engender an inflationary period .",
    "nevertheless , it is not a essential problem for eternal cyclic universe since the causal connection could be established in previous cycle .",
    "still , the subject about formation and/or dissociation of structure ( linked with the evolution of energy density fluctuations ) is an important topic and should be investigated in the future .",
    "other question concerns about the features of nled used . as mentioned in section [ sec - mu ] ,",
    "the nled was only used to describe the cosmological magnetic field while the radiation was retracted by the standard electrodynamics .",
    "so , the non - linear effects act only in the magnetic field and the description of a free radiation remains as in maxwell theory .",
    "the main reason to adopt this approach is because quantum corrections due vacuum polarization changes the classical lagrangian introducing nonlinear terms @xcite . and",
    "the new terms only appear when we are treating with a quasi - static electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "so , the fundamental lagrangian is the maxwell one and the extra terms are just effects of vacuum polarization .",
    "this approach is directly related with the model stability . indeed ,",
    "if we consider the @xmath4 as fundamental lagrangian instead of maxwell lagrangian the model necessarily will present instabilities near to bounce ( see appendix b ) .    for a wide point of view",
    ", we can speculate that the electromagnetic phenomenons in extremum conditions ( e. g. very large and very short scale ) are described by a non - linear generalization of maxwell electrodynamics . assuming that this generalization in a given scale could be expanded in positive and negative powers of @xmath246 , it is necessary for convergence which @xmath247 and @xmath248 for @xmath249 .",
    "so , it can be argued that in this model the maximum and the minimum values for the scale factor limit the influence of @xmath250 terms with @xmath251 , i.e. terms of kind @xmath252 and @xmath253 are negligible in all cosmological time . in this context ,",
    "the proposal lagrangian is an approximation for a generic non - linear electrodynamics theory .",
    "i would like to acknowledge m. novello , j. salim and a. n. arajo for the very useful discussion and comments .",
    "i also acknowledge support of faperj .",
    "the standard cosmological model , provided by the flrw geometry , obeys the cosmological principle , which means that the 3-space is homogeneous and isotropic geometry .",
    "thus , for compatibility with the cosmological framework , it is necessary an average procedure in the electromagnetic field @xcite . as usual",
    ", we set the volume - tric spatial average of a quantity @xmath254 by    @xmath255    where @xmath256 . and to generate the compatibility with the flrw geometry , it is necessary to impose that @xmath257@xmath258 thus , applying the average procedure in the energy - momentum tensor produced by a @xmath259 , we obtain a @xmath260 of a perfect fluid where @xmath261and @xmath262 the bar above @xmath263 point out that spatial average was performed .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to discuss the model stability .",
    "as it is well known all flat cosmological model with bounce violates the null energy condition ( nec ) . on the other hand , in @xcite was shown that under fairly general conditions the nec violation necessarily implies instability ( ghosts ) .",
    "more specifically , the authors showed that when all null vectors violate nec ( as in isotropic systems ) or when superluminal excitations are not present , the nec violation will result in instabilities .",
    "these statements extend in a straightforward manner for isotropic fluids through the lagrangian formulation for fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to ask if the proposed model is stable ?          to analyze the stability of a model it is necessary to perturb this model and analyze the behavior of these perturbations .",
    "thus , in the context of magnetic universe model , this analysis should be separated in two cases : perturbations taken before the achievement of spatial averages and perturbations taken after this achievement .",
    "let s discuss the first case ( perturbations taken before ) .",
    "the term @xmath266 arises when quantum corrections from vacuum polarization are interpreted classically @xcite .",
    "indeed , schwinger showed in @xcite that for quasi - static electromagnetic fields the effects of vacuum polarization induce corrections in the classical lagrangian and the first of these corrections is given by @xmath267 .",
    "it is worth noting that the complete results obtained in @xcite and @xcite are non - perturbative .",
    "so , the term @xmath267 represents the inclusion ( classical ) of effects of vacuum polarization in the cosmological background .",
    "therefore , the quantum perturbations should be done in the usual lagrangian of electrodynamics @xmath268 which does not present any instability problem . in this context , the quantization of @xmath269 or any other @xmath4 is completely meaningless .    for the second case",
    ", the perturbations must be performed in energy - momentum tensor of perfect fluid ( isotropic background ) .",
    "so , the conclusions found in @xcite can be directly applied , and therefore the violation of nec will imply in an unstable model . note that these perturbations should necessarily be of classical type ( such as gravitational perturbations ) since the spatial average has already been taken . in the magnetic universe model ,",
    "this period of instability occurs only near to bounce and it quickly ends ( see section [ sec - boun ] ) .    from a different point of view , we can look at ( [ l_boun ] ) as a fundamental lagrangian .",
    "thus , it is necessary to analyze the stability of this lagrangian .",
    "the term @xmath270 will be neglected because it does not generate instabilities .",
    "so ,          to establish if there is a violation of nec it is necessary analyze the quantity @xmath276 where @xmath277 is a null vector . performing this calculation in flrw background we obtain the following equation : @xmath278 \\left [ \\frac{\\vec { n}\\times\\vec{b}}{a}\\right ]   ^{2 } , \\label{nec}%\\ ] ] where @xmath263 is function of @xmath279 .",
    "thus , to happen nec violation ( @xmath280 ) the first bracket should be negative .",
    "another important point is that if @xmath280 then _ all null vector _ violate nec .    in general",
    ", the above equation is not spatially isotropic since @xmath275 may depend on points in space .",
    "indeed , it is assumed that @xmath275 has a random spatial distribution whose spatial average is determined by ( [ nl32 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible there are regions of space with instability ( where nec is violated for all null vectors ) and other regions perfectly stable .",
    "note that the instabilities only appear at many different points of space if , on average , the term @xmath281 is of the order ( or larger ) of unity , i.e. @xmath282 @xmath283 , and it is exactly what happens near to bounce .",
    "so , using the bouncing condition ( [ boun ] ) and ( [ l_b ] ) follows      since , on average , the signal of ( [ nec ] ) is determined by @xmath286   \\ \\ \\ \\text{or \\ } \\ \\left [ 1 - 16\\alpha^{2}b^{2}\\right ]   , \\ ] ] it is possible to conclude that near to bounce most regions will present unstable perturbations .",
    "however , as the universe expands the factor @xmath287 decreases causing a decrease in the number of regions with unstable perturbations .",
    "note that with the increase of @xmath288 in only one order of magnitude the probability of having a region with unstable perturbations is negligible .",
    "one interesting possibility for future work is to study how the perturbations generated near to bounce evolve ."
