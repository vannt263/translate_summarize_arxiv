    "although more than a quarter of a century has elapsed since the discovery of superconductivity in the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) organic charge - transfer ( bechgaard ) salts of @xmath3-type ( where @xmath4 stands for tetramethyltetraselenofulvalinium and @xmath5 being a strong electron acceptor or anion ) @xcite , many distinct properties of this material still remain a matter of debate . among those one may mention the pairing symmetry , the remarkable sensitivity of the critical temperature to irradiation @xcite , large upper critical field @xmath6 etcetera ( see , also ref . ) .",
    "the irradiation destroys anion order , introducing thus non - magnetic damage into system that led abrikosov to suggest the possibility of triplet pairing @xcite in the organic salts .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental evidence @xcite that the spin - susceptibility decreases at low magnetic fields in the superconducting ( sc ) state of the @xmath7 organic conductor , disfavors the triplet pairing mechanism and supports spin - singlet pairing .",
    "low temperature properties of organic superconductors are known to be very sensitive to disorder .",
    "alloying with anions , @xmath8-ray irradiation , or cooling rate controlled anion reorientation introduces non - magnetic randomness into the system , however leaving unchanged , to a large extent , the backbone structure and the unit cell of the organic superconductors .",
    "there is a common agreement that disorder , when introduced by means of these experimental methods , must be characterized as non - magnetic . yet , it was shown @xcite to suppress the sc phase .",
    "it is worth noting that the methods of generating non - magnetic disorder in layered organic superconductors are similar ( see , e.g. ref . ) to those in quasi-1d systems , and , therefore a similar mechanism of sc state suppression in these two classes of materials may exist .",
    "studies of disorder effects on the superconducting phase have a long history .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 for @xmath9-wave pairing has been shown to be insensitive to the scattering rate on non - magnetic impurities , which is known as the anderson theorem @xcite .",
    "in contrast to non - magnetic impurities , paramagnetic impurities break time - reversal symmetry of the @xmath9-pairing , and suppress the sc - phase @xcite at some critical concentration of the impurities .",
    "correlation between the paramagnetic impurities via the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction yields a spin - glass phase below @xmath10 , which was shown @xcite to shift the superconducting transition point towards higher temperatures .",
    "the anderson theorem is not applicable to unconventional superconductors with @xmath11-wave pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "a small concentration of non - magnetic impurities may destroy @xmath11-wave pairing , producing a finite lifetime for quasi - particles near the nodes in the gap @xcite .",
    "inter - chain ( inter - layer ) pairings as well as intra - chain ( intra - layer ) pairings , occurring at different local critical temperatures in quasi-1d ( quasi-2d ) systems , yield also an inhomogeneous nodal order parameter @xcite , which affect considerably the upper critical magnetic field .",
    "suppression of superconductivity in the presence of non - magnetic impurities can in general be realized by destroying either the modulus or the phase coherence of the order parameter .",
    "interplay between superconductivity and anderson localization in a strongly disordered superconductor was shown @xcite to result in spatial inhomogeneity of the order parameter .",
    "diffusive scattering of particles in the random field of non - magnetic impurities enhances coulomb repulsion @xcite , and consequently , reduces the amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "mesoscopic fluctuations in a superconducting thin film were also shown @xcite to yield a spatial inhomogeneity of the order parameter .",
    "effects of order parameter phase fluctuations on the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 have been studied in refs .. it is well known that there is no sc phase transition in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems @xcite , since strong fluctuations of the order parameter phase destroy off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) in a single sc wire and in an isolated sc film .",
    "even a small interchain - coupling in clean quasi-1d superconductors restores however odlro together with a finite transition temperature .",
    "the suppression of @xmath0 by strong phase fluctuations in clean quasi-1d superconductors was analyzed in ref .. classifying superconductors with small stiffness as bad metals , emery and kivelson have evaluated @xcite a critical temperature of phase ordering by formally dividing a clean bulk superconductor into small regions with well defined phase , and have shown considerable suppression of an sc - phase by phase fluctuations .",
    "effects of disorder on phase fluctuations were however not considered in all of these papers .",
    "distinct structural peculiarities of quasi-1d organic superconductors demand a special theory , which should take into account non - magnetic randomness as well as phase fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the high purity of the organic superconductor backbone , even in an overall dirty limit , excludes spatial inhomogeneity of the order parameter modulus along the sc - wires .",
    "this renders inapplicable the above - mentioned theories for pair breaking .",
    "in contrast to these previous activities we study in this article a disorder - driven superconductor - normal metal phase transitions due to the competition of non - magnetic randomness and phase - fluctuations in quasi-1d superconductors .",
    "we consider weakly linked quasi - one - dimensional superconductors with random josephson - couplings between pure one - dimensional ( 1d ) sc wires .",
    "singlet pairing is assumed within the wires .",
    "therefore , we assume that non - magnetic randomness does not affect the order parameter amplitude .",
    "we demonstrate in this article that    \\(i ) non - magnetic randomness in the josephson - coupling destroys correlation of the phases between different chains in quasi-1d superconductors even in the classical phase fluctuation regime ,    \\(ii ) non - magnetic randomness yields quantum critical behavior in addition .",
    "a superconducting normal - metal phase transition occurs at @xmath2 increasing the strength of disorder , and    \\(iii ) a suppression of the sc phase occurs discontinuously as well both the classical and the quantum phase fluctuation regimes as a first - order phase transition when the disorder - strength reaches a critical value .",
    "we derive parallel and perpendicular components of the penetration depth , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and show that they diverge at different critical temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which correspond to pair - breaking in the wires and to phase coherence breaking between the sc wires , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we study the interplay of randomness in the josephson energy with phase fluctuations inside the classical regime . although an arbitrary small interchain coupling in a clean quasi-1d superconductor stabilizes the odlro giving a finite transition temperature @xmath0 , we show in this section that non - magnetic disorder in the josephson energy suppresses @xmath0 discontinuously when the disorder - strength reaches a critical value . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate effects of randomness on the transverse rigidity and on @xmath0 in the quantum fluctuations regime .",
    "we show in this section that a suppression of the sc phase is managed by two parameters characterizing the disorder - strength and a dynamical charging parameter @xmath14 in the system .",
    "the quantum criticality at @xmath15 and the phase transition at finite temperature are described separately .",
    "the transverse rigidity in the field of the phases is shown to vanish discontinuously .",
    "the jump at the breakdown point decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath14 in the interval of @xmath16 , and vanishes for @xmath17 .",
    "the breakdown point is pushed towards higher values of the disorder - strength as @xmath14 increases .",
    "we show that , under a change of the disorder - strength , the critical temperature evolves similarly as the transverse rigidity at @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of diamagnetism in this section reveals completely different behavior for parallel and perpendicular components of the penetration depth . the penetration depth for a magnetic field parallel to the sc - wires",
    "is shown to be defined by the phase - phase correlator between two neighboring wires , which behaves non - linearly in temperature and reveals a discontinuous dependence on disorder ; by contrast the perpendicular penetration depth does not depend on disorder and shows a conventional temperature dependence . in sec .",
    "v we summarize results obtained in the paper .",
    "the explicit evaluation of the phase - phase correlator is given in the appendix .",
    "a quasi-1d superconductor is modeled as a system of one - dimensional wires , which are placed regularly and parallel to each other , forming for example a square lattice in the cross - section .",
    "weak tunneling between the chains results in an open fermi surface for the normal metallic state , and yields also the josephson - coupling between nearest - neighboring chains in the superconducting state and strong anisotropy in kinetic properties .    the free energy functional of a quasi-1d superconductor , which is weakly linked with josephson - coupling energy @xmath18 between nearest - neighbor chains , can be written in the presence of the magnetic field @xmath19 as @xmath20 { } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\xi_{\\| } a^2_{\\perp } \\frac{({\\bf b}({\\bf r } ) - { \\bf b}_{ext})^2}{8 \\pi } \\bigg \\ } , \\label{freeenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the phase of the order parameter @xmath22 at a point with dimensionless coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the vector - potential , and @xmath25 the linear density of sc electrons with @xmath26 at @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",

    "the thermodynamic averages in the expression of @xmath67 are taken with the free energy functional , given by eq.([eff - energy ] ) , at the saddle point @xmath68 .",
    "so , a contribution of the non - magnetic randomness to the effective free - energy functional is proportional to the variance of the phase correlator , which gives an idea on the form of the disorder - dependent term in the effective functional .",

    "the dependence of @xmath0 on the disorder is determined by the zero - temperature transverse rigidity @xmath207 , the behavior of which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ tc - quantum ] .",
    "therefore , for arbitrary @xmath217 the critical temperature decreases monotonically with increasing randomness and drops to zero at the critical disorder strength @xmath241 .",
    "the variation of the critical temperature versus the residual resistivity of the organic superconductor @xmath242 has been explored by joo et al . in ref .. the experimental data are read off from ref . and copied into fig.[exper ] in order to provide a close comparison with a theoretical fit - curve as obtained from eq.([fig3-curve ] ) of the present theory .    in this first approach and within a moderate accuracy , the data as published in the paper of joo et al .",
    ", eventually appear to find an explanation by our theory . in order to establish the link between experiment and theory ,",
    "the following argument is exploited : the substitution of @xmath243 anions by @xmath244 in the relaxed ( r ) samples increases the residual resistivity , which is proportional to the inverse lifetime @xmath245 of electron as well as to the disorder strength @xmath41 ( as used in the present theory ) .    for the relaxed samples of ref .",
    ", referred to as the r - sample(s ) , the doping concentration @xmath8 varies in the interval of @xmath246 under slow cooling from the clean sample to the nominal concentration @xmath247 .",
    "slow cooling of @xmath248-samples assures a uniform orientation of the anions along the stacking axis , whereas fast cooling in the ( quenched ) @xmath249-samples introduces strong orientational disorder and increases the residual resistivity .",
    "@xmath0 decreases quasi - linearly with increasing disorder ( or the residual resistivity ) in the large interval of the randomness . around the breakdown point",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on randomness is non - linear .",
    "the critical doping concentration , corresponding to the breakdown of the superconducting state , grows with the quantum charging effect in the system .",
    "substitution of @xmath243 anions by @xmath250 seems to increase the quantum charging parameter @xmath14 , shifting thus the breakdown point to a higher value of the residual resistivity .",
    "all these features and experimental evidences agree well with the theory .    in order to compare with other well - known cases of @xmath0-suppression by disorder",
    "we consider the pair breaking theory for a superconductor with unconventional gap symmetry @xcite .",
    "this physically different case of @xmath0-reduction by _ non - magnetic _ impurities in _ unconventional _",
    "superconductors was found to be described by the famous digamma - formula of abrikosov - gorkov s conventional pair breaking theory @xcite in the presence of _ paramagnetic _ impurities .",
    "the @xmath0-reduction may thus be expressed in the form @xmath251 where @xmath252 means the digamma function , @xmath253 is the depairing parameter , and @xmath254 the elastic scattering time . both theoretical curves , as shown in the insets of fig.[exper ] , can be chosen to coincide for weak and moderately strong disorder ( where the linear decay is rather unspecific ) .",
    "approaching the sc - breakdown at larger disorder they differ however substantially . the agl - solution for unconventional pairing approaches @xmath255 continuously and obeys a square root dependence @xmath256 , where @xmath257 stands for the disorder - strength in the agl - case .",
    "this square root law follows from the leading ( @xmath258 ) correction of the digamma - function @xmath259 given by the laurent series of its exponential @xmath260= \\frac{\\tilde{q}}{z}+\\frac{z}{24\\tilde{q}}+o(z^2)\\ ] ] near the logarithmic branch point of @xmath252 at infinity , hence @xmath261 . in the physical context the variable @xmath262 corresponds to the critical temperature @xmath0 of eq.([digamma ] ) . by comparing the exponential of eq.([digamma ] ) one can see that @xmath263 is reached for @xmath264 .",
    "by contrast , the present theory does not allow for a continuous breakdown of superconductivity . according to fig.3 the suppression of @xmath0 is stronger and",
    "an abrupt breakdown occurs at @xmath265 .",
    "the numerical data show a square root behavior however near the minimal finite @xmath0 .",
    "the breakdown point in the curve , corresponding to our theory , seems to allow for the existence of an intermediate phase , perhaps a glassy phase below a tricritical point .",
    "the current density is calculated according to @xmath266 , where @xmath267 . the complete expression for @xmath268 in the linear response approximation",
    "can be obtained after averaging of @xmath269 over disorder ( [ gauss ] ) by using eq.([freeenergy ] ) for @xmath270 .",
    "one obtains @xmath271 for the longitudinal component of the current and @xmath272 for the transverse component of the current .    for simplicity",
    "we present here only the diamagnetic contribution to the @xmath273-th ( @xmath274 ) component of the current @xmath275 where the longitudinal ( @xmath12 ) and the transverse component ( @xmath13 ) of the penetration depth are obtained as @xmath276 and @xmath277 while @xmath278 diverges at @xmath279 due to pair breaking in the sc wires , @xmath280 diverges at the global sc transition temperature @xmath82 , where the phase coherence between neighboring wires is destroyed .",
    "the temperature and the randomness dependencies of @xmath278 and @xmath280 also strongly differ each other .",
    "the transverse component of the penetration depth is determined by the phase - phase correlator , revealing non - linear temperature dependence and discontinuous behavior at the critical disorder strength .",
    "nevertheless the longitudinal component of the penetration depth is given by the conventional london expression and does not depend on the disorder strength .",
    "randomness in the josephson coupling shifts @xmath0 to lower temperatures and , therefore , the magnetic field parallel to the sc wires penetrates easier into the organic superconductor .",
    "on the other hand , the type of disorder considered in this article does not break the cooper pairs , keeping thus the penetration of a perpendicular magnetic field into the sc wires unchanged .",
    "in this paper we report disorder - effects on @xmath0 and on the diamagnetism of quasi-1d superconductors with random josephson - couplings .",
    "interplay of non - magnetic disorder with quantum phase fluctuations plays a central role for the superconductor normal - metal phase transitions in this class of quasi-1d superconductors .",
    "recent experimental data found in refs . are shown to be consistent with the present theory .",
    "quantum criticality is controlled by two quantities , namely disorder strength and a dynamical parameter of phase fluctuations .",
    "the present model s quantum criticality signals the existence of a quantum critical phase between sc- and normal phase .",
    "its nature deserves further investigation .",
    "in our study we neglect the effects of non - linear excitations , which are a subject of current interest in low dimensional systems .",
    "note that this topic was explicitly studied by us for quasi-2d josephson coupled superconductors in ref . .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , the classical motion of the phase is described by a system of coupled sine - gordon type non - linear equations ( [ dynamics ] ) , which contains non - linear dynamic excitations as well as static topological defects .",
    "the self - consistent phonon approximation allows us to calculate the phase - phase correlator between two arbitrary points @xmath281 and @xmath282 @xmath283 which can be shown to decrease at @xmath284 and @xmath285 as a power law @xmath286 , setting up a quasi - long - range order and implying the existence of a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) topological phase transition @xcite(perhaps at @xmath2 ) in a single sc wire . the critical index @xmath287 contains both phonon and vortex contributions .",
    "although the phonon contribution to @xmath287 can be calculated within the scha , it is not clear how the vortex contribution changes the former one . in our knowledge ,",
    "the mechanism of excitations of the vortices with opposite fugacities and their binding in quasi-1d superconductors has not been adequately studied , and the topic needs further investigations .",
    "this research was supported by the dfg under grant op28/7 - 1 .",
