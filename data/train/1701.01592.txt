    "about half a century before the discovery of the integral invariant of velocity circulation , @xcite found a _ local _ form of this conservation law , now called the _ cauchy invariants _ , which constitutes the central topic of the present paper .",
    "the somewhat tortuous history of the cauchy invariants has been documented by @xcite .",
    "starting in the sixties , the cauchy invariants were rediscovered by application of the noether theorem , which relates continuous invariance groups and conservation laws ; at first this was done without attribution to cauchy @xcite .",
    "but , eventually , near the end of the 20th century , proper attribution was made @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been growing interest in cauchy invariants because of the development of new applications , such as analyticity in time of fluid - particle trajectories ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , and the design of very accurate semi - lagrangian numerical schemes for fluid flow @xcite .    our geometric approach to the cauchy invariants will allow us to achieve two goals . on the one hand to unify various vorticity results : as we shall see , the 3d cauchy invariants as originally formulated , the cauchy formula relating current and initial vorticity are the analogs of the law of conservation of vorticity in 2d ideal incompressible flow . on the other hand it will allow us to extend the invariants into various directions : higher - order cauchy invariants , mhd flow , flow in euclidean spaces of any dimension , flow in curved spaces . of course",
    ", flows of practical interest are not restricted to flat space .",
    "curved spaces appear not only in general relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite , but also for flows in the atmosphere and oceans of planets @xcite , for studies of the energy inverse cascade on negatively curved spaces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , for flows on curved biological membranes @xcite .",
    "hereafter , the notation 1d , 2d and 3d will refer to the usual one , two and three - dimensional flat ( euclidean ) spaces .",
    "for carrying out this program our key tools will be differential geometry and , to a lesser extent , variational methods .    in differential geometry we shall make use of lie s generalisation of advection ( transport ) .",
    "the lie advection of a scalar quantity is just its invariance along fluid - particle trajectories .",
    "but , here , we consider more general objects , such as vectors , @xmath0-forms and tensors .",
    "for example , for our purpose , it is more convenient to consider the vorticity as a @xmath3-form ( roughly an antisymmetric second - order tensor ) , rather than as a vector field .",
    "these non - scalar objects live in vector spaces spanned by some basis , and lie advection requires taking into account the distortion of the underlying vector space structure , which moves and deforms with the flow .",
    "the generalisation of the particular ( material ) derivative to tensors is thus the lie derivative .    as to variational ( least - action ) methods",
    ", an important advantage is that they are applicable with very little change to both flat and curved spaces , provided one uses arnold s formulation of ideal incompressible fluid flow as geodesics on the space sdiff of volume preserving smooth maps @xcite . to obtain the cauchy invariants",
    "the key modern tool is noether s theorem with the appropriate continuous invariance group , namely the relabelling invariance in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the latter can be viewed as a continuous counterpart of the permutation of lagrangian labels if the fluids were constituted of a finite number of fluid elements ; note that continuous volume - preserving transformations may be approached by such permutations @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec : aracli ] is about lie derivatives , an extension to flow on manifolds of what is called in fluid mechanics the lagrangian or material derivative .",
    "we prove a general result about lie - advection invariance for @xmath0-forms of order @xmath4 .",
    "this result asserts that a @xmath0-form that is lie - advection invariant has associated cauchy - type invariants .    in secs .",
    "[ sec : vifih ]  and  [ sec : ahmhd ] we turn to various applications in hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vifih ] , we show that the existence of cauchy invariants is equivalent to the invariance of the vorticity @xmath3-form under the lagrangian flow , actually known since @xcite ; more precisely , it is the invariance under `` pullback '' , that is , the change of coordinates from eulerian to lagrangian .",
    "although this observation does not produce new unknown invariants , it has the advantage of showing that cauchy s invariance laws are of the same nature as the laws of vorticity conservation in 2d and of vorticity flux conservation in 3d .",
    "this is not much stressed in the existing literature dealing with fundamentals of fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "this point of view will also bring out that the cauchy invariants and the cauchy vorticity formula are representations of the same conservation law , related by a transformation , called hodge duality , to which we shall come back . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ahmhd ] our main result leads in particular to various generalisation of local ( material ) helicity conservation laws ( @xmath2 ) for euler flow and for mhd flow .",

    "certain technical questions are handled in appendices  [ sec : geodiffeuler ] , [ sec : eulerflap ] , [ sec : cv2ffnt ] , [ sec : rsym2form ] and [ appendixcf ] .",

    "an introduction to differential geometry is available in @xcite .",
    "more advanced material , which we found quite useful , is in @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to make the material in the present paper more readily accessible to the fluid mechanics community . for this , in the body of the paper , whenever we use a concept from differential geometry that the reader may not be familiar with , e.g. a `` pullback , '' we give a soft definition in simple language and we refer to a suitable subsection of appendix  [ sec : cicf ] `` differential geometry in a nutshell '' .",
    "there , the reader will find more precise definitions and whenever possible short proofs of key results , together with precise references ( including section or page numbers ) to what , we believe , is particularly readable specialised literature on the topic .",
    "in the present paper we prefer not starting with a barrage of mathematical definitions and we rather appeal to the reader s intuition . for those hungry of precise definitions ,",

    "the concept of a differentiable manifold @xmath5 generalises to an arbitrary dimension @xmath6 that of a curve or a surface embedded in the 3d euclidean space @xmath7 . to achieve this in an intrinsic fashion without directly using cartesian coordinates",
    ", the most common procedure makes use of collections of local charts , which are smooth bijections ( one - to - one correspondences ) with pieces of @xmath8 .    by taking infinitesimal increments near a point @xmath9 , one obtains tangent vectors , which are in the @xmath6-dimensional tangent space @xmath10 , a generalisation of the tangent line to a curve and the tangent plane to a surface .",
    "the union of all these tangent vectors @xmath11 , denoted @xmath12 , is called the tangent bundle .",
    "as for ordinary vector spaces , one can define the dual of the tangent bundle , noted @xmath13 , which can be constructed through linear forms , called @xmath14-forms or cotangent vectors , acting on vectors of the tangent bundle @xmath12 .",
    "the set of all these cotangent vectors is called the cotangent bundle , noted @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , @xmath0-forms , where @xmath0 is an integer , are skew symmetric @xmath0-linear forms over the tangent bundle @xmath12 . note that in a flat ( euclidean ) space @xmath8 with coordinates @xmath15 where @xmath16 ,",
    "a 1-form is simply an expression @xmath17 , which depends linearly on the infinitesimal increments @xmath18 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that 1-forms where in common use in fluid mechanics in the works of dalembert , euler and lagrange more than a century before vectors were commonly used , say , in the lectures of gibbs .",
    "an important operator on @xmath0-forms is the _ exterior derivative _ , noted @xmath6 , which linearly maps @xmath0-forms to @xmath19-forms ( see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : edip ] ) . an explicit definition of @xmath6 is not very helpful to build an intuitive feeling , but it is worth pointing out that the square of @xmath6 is zero or , in words , an exact form ( a form that is the exterior derivative of another one ) is closed ( its exterior derivative vanishes ) . under certain conditions ,",
    "to which we shall come back , the converse is true .      in this section",
    "we present some standard mathematical concepts needed to introduce our theorem on _ generalised cauchy invariants _ , stated in the next section . for this",
    ", we need to generalise the fluid mechanics concept of _ lagrangian invariant _ , which applies to a scalar quantity that does not change along fluid particle trajectories .",
    "the generalisation is called _ lie - advection invariance _ (",
    "alternative terminologies found in the literature are `` lie - transport '' and `` lie - dragging '' ) .",
    "first we introduce the _ pullback _ and _ pushforward _ operations , which arise naturally when applying a change of variable , here , between lagrangian and eulerian coordinates at a fixed time @xmath20 ( later , we shall let this _ dynamical time",
    "the lagrangian variable ( initial position of the fluid particle ) , denoted by @xmath21 , is on a manifold @xmath5 ( called here for concreteness _ lagrangian _ ) , while the eulerian variable ( current position of the fluid particle ) , denoted by @xmath22 , is on a manifold @xmath23 ( called here _ eulerian _ ) .",
    "the sets @xmath5 and @xmath23 may or may not coincide . the lagrangian map linking @xmath9 to @xmath24 is defined as follows @xmath25 the change of variable @xmath26 induces two operations that connect objects ( such as functions , vectors , forms and tensors ) , defined on @xmath5 to corresponding ones , defined on @xmath23 .",
    "they are the _ pushforward _ operator , which sends objects defined on @xmath5 to ones defined on @xmath23 and its inverse , the _ pullback _ operator . to define these transformations",
    "precisely , it is convenient to consider successively the cases where these operators act on real - valued functions ( scalars ) , then on vectors , then and on @xmath14-forms , and finally on more involved objects such as @xmath0-forms , obtainable from the former ones by linear combinations of tensor products ( see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : te ] ) .",
    "is the integral curve of a given vector field @xmath27 , while the curve @xmath28 is the integral curve of @xmath29 .",
    "the pullback transformation @xmath30 is a change of variables from eulerian to lagrangian coordinates , while the pushforward transformation @xmath31 is a change of variables from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates . ]    for the case of scalars , namely elements of @xmath32 , the set of real - valued smooth function defined on @xmath5 , the pullback is simply a change of variable from eulerian to lagrangian variables and the pushforward is the converse . specifically , the pushforward of a function @xmath33 on @xmath5 is @xmath34 , where the symbol @xmath35 denotes the usual composition of maps .",
    "conversely , the pullback of a function @xmath36 on @xmath23 is @xmath37 .",
    "now , we turn to vector fields , denoted @xmath38 on @xmath5 , a subset of the tangent bundle @xmath12 .",
    "( why we use the notation @xmath38 will become clear later . ) at this point we can not just make a change of variable , because the lagrangian and the eulerian vectors take values in different tangent spaces .",
    "but we can reinterpret tangent vectors to a manifold in terms of differentials of scalar functions defined on that manifold . to implement this ,",
    "it is useful to consider a vector field @xmath39 on @xmath5 as the generator of a suitable flow on @xmath5 . for this",
    ", we need an auxiliary time variable , denoted @xmath40 , to parametrise a family of smooth maps @xmath41 .",
    "observe that the time @xmath40 is not related to the dynamical time @xmath20 , which so far is held fixed .",
    "the maps satisfy the following equations @xmath42 the pushforward of the vector field @xmath43 ( also called the differential of the map @xmath44 or the tangent map ) is now defined locally at the point @xmath9 , as the linear map @xmath45 , obtained by simply identifying the resulting vector with the tangent vector to the mapped curve .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ difgeo ] .",
    "translated into equations it means that @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the tangent map and is given locally by the jacobian matrix @xmath48 . recalling that @xmath49 denotes local coordinates on @xmath5 and @xmath50 local coordinates on @xmath23 , in terms of these local coordinates ,",
    "this formula is expressed equivalently as @xmath51 to define the inverse operation , the pullback denoted @xmath30 , we just interchange @xmath44 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "it thus follows that the pullback of a vector field @xmath43 on @xmath23 is @xmath55 therefore we find that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "notice that @xmath44 must be a diffeomorphism ( one - to - one smooth map ) in order for the pullback and pushforward operations to make sense ; the only exception to this is the pullback of functions ( and covariant tensors , see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : pp ] ) , since the inverse map is then not needed .",
    "thus vector fields can only be pulled back and pushed forward by diffeomorphisms .",
    "we can extend pullback and pushforward operations to linear forms on vector fields , that is 1-forms or covectors .",
    "the set of such @xmath14-forms fields on @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath58 ( see appendices  [ ssec : cicf : te ]  and  [ ssec : cicf : eadf ] ) . in order to define the pullback of a @xmath14-form @xmath59",
    ", we introduce the linear map @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 where the duality bracket @xmath62 is the natural pairing between the spaces @xmath10 and @xmath63 or between the spaces @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the pushforward of a @xmath14-form @xmath66 , is defined by changing @xmath44 to @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath67 . in terms of local coordinates",
    "we have @xmath68 therefore we find that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "pullback and pushforward operations are easily generalised to tensor fields @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the set of @xmath0-covariant and @xmath73-contravariant tensor fields on @xmath5 .",
    "such generalisations follow naturally since a @xmath0-covariant and @xmath73-contravariant tensor can be written as linear combinations of tensor products of @xmath0 @xmath14-forms and @xmath73-vectors ( see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : te ] ) .    in order to define the _ lie derivative ,",
    "_ we bring in the dynamical time @xmath20 . for this",
    ", we specialize to the case where the lagrangian and the eulerian points are on the same manifold ( with @xmath74 ) and we consider a time - dependent vector field @xmath75 , the _ velocity field , _ taken in @xmath38 for all @xmath76 . this velocity field",
    "is prescribed a priori and we do not have to specify which dynamical equation it satisfies .",
    "we define a time - dependent lagrangian map @xmath77 in the usual fluid mechanical sense as mapping the initial position of a fluid particle , following the flow , to its position at time @xmath20 , namely as the solution of the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath78 from this equation , we also define a @xmath3-time lagrangian map @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 as the map from the position of a fluid particle at time @xmath40 to its position at time @xmath20 . allowing the time to run backwards , we do not impose @xmath82 .",
    "obviously , we have @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , we obviously have the group composition rule @xmath84    in this dynamical setting , the pullback and pushforward operations consist roughly in following a given tensor field , while taking into account the geometrical deformation of the tensor basis , along the lagrangian flow .",
    "this will naturally lead to considering a derivative with respect to the lagrangian flow , called the lie derivative .",
    "the lie derivative of a structure ( for instance a vector , a @xmath14-form or a tensor field ) with respect to the time - dependent vector field @xmath75 measures the instantaneous rate of geometrical variation of the structure ( tensor basis ) as it is transported and deformed by the lagrangian flow @xmath77 generated by @xmath75 .",
    "specifically , we first define the lie derivative acting on a time - independent tensor field @xmath85 . to the lagrangian map",
    "@xmath86 we associate its pullback @xmath87 , constructed just as earlier in this section , when the dynamical time was held fixed .",
    "the lie derivative with respect to @xmath75 is defines by @xmath88    now , we turn to a time - dependent tensor field @xmath89 and we derive the _ lie derivative theorem _ @xmath90 . for this , we calculate the time - derivative of @xmath91 , using the product rule for derivatives and obtain @xmath92 then , using the group composition rule , this equation becomes @xmath93 using a property for the pullback of map composition ( see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : pp ] ) , namely @xmath94 , we obtain @xmath95 finally , using the definition of the lie derivative , this equation leads to the following formula , known as the lie derivative theorem : @xmath96    in this paper , a central role will be played by tensor fields that are _ lie - advection invariant _ ( in short _ lie invariant _ ) . a lie - advection invariant tensor field @xmath97 is such that its lagrangian pullback , i.e. its pullback to time @xmath98 , is equal to the initial tensor field , that is @xmath99 in fluid mechanics terms , one states that the tensor field @xmath97 is frozen into the flow @xmath77 .",
    "from the lie derivative theorem , we immediately find that this is equivalent to having the tensor field @xmath97 satisfying the equation @xmath100 which is called the lie advection equation . a tensor field @xmath97 satisfying the lie - advection equation is said to be lie - advected by the flow of @xmath75 .",
    "it is easily checked that when @xmath97 is a scalar field ( denoted @xmath101 ) and when the manifold reduces to an euclidean space , becomes just @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the eulerian derivative .",
    "hence in the scalar case , lie - advection invariance of @xmath101 is the same as stating that @xmath101 is a lagrangian ( material ) invariant in the usual fluid mechanical sense .",
    "the advantage of the lie - advection invariance formulation for higher - order objects is that , e.g. , in 3d the vorticity  when considered as a @xmath3-form  is then also lie - advection invariant , as noticed for the first time ( in 19th century language ) by @xcite .      in this section we state a general theorem",
    "about lie - advection invariance using differential geometry tools .",
    "the result is a natural generalisation of cauchy invariants that arises when we consider lie - advected exact @xmath0-form in an euclidean space @xmath8 or on a @xmath6-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath104 .",
    "a @xmath6-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath104 is a differentiable manifold @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 , together with a @xmath3-covariant tensor field , the metric tensor @xmath105 , which associates to any point @xmath106 a @xmath3-covariant tensor @xmath107 ( see appendices  [ ssec : cicf : te ]  and  [ ssec : cicf : rm ] ) .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath105 allows one both to define a metric on @xmath5 for measuring distances between two points on @xmath5 , and to define a suitable scalar product for vectors lying in a tangent space ( see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : rm ] ) .    the main new result of the present section , will be to show that , to each exact lie - advected @xmath0-form , corresponds a generalised cauchy invariant",
    "the method of proving this is quite general but , of course , also applies to euler flow in the ordinary flat 3d space . in that case",
    ", we already have the original proof of @xcite , which juggles with eulerian and lagrangian coordinates and thus has a flavour of pullback - pushforward argument .",
    "in addition , we have all the relatively recent derivations using noether s theorem in conjunction with a variational formulation of the euler equations and the relabelling invariance ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ", the space @xmath396 represents the lagrangian ( material ) description while the space @xmath394 represents the eulerian ( spatial ) description . for more details about lie groups , lie algebra , and their applications in physics ,",

    ". a precise definition of the action on a tensor @xmath404 of the pullback operator @xmath30 is given in appendix  [ ssec : cicf : pp ] , but roughly speaking it consists in evaluating the tensor @xmath404 at the point @xmath405 , @xmath406 ( that is the right composition of @xmath404 with @xmath44 ) , while taking into account the deformation of the structure induced by the map @xmath44 ( reminiscent of a jacobian matrix ) . for the volume form @xmath401 , the @xmath6-covariant antisymmetric tensor @xmath407 where @xmath408 is the generalised kronecker symbol ( see appendix  [ sec : cicf ] ) , we obtain by pullback @xmath409 @xmath410 is a lie group when @xmath175 is a compact differentiable manifold . even if it not so , we can associate to @xmath388 the lie algebra @xmath411 consisting of all divergence - free vector fields @xmath195 tangent to the boundary ( if it is not empty ) , i.e. such that @xmath412 where @xmath216 is the covariant derivative and @xmath413 denotes the unit outer normal vector at the boundary @xmath414 .",

    "thus it is sufficient to give a right - invariant metric at one point of the group ( for instance the identity ) , since the metric can be carried over to the remaining points of the group by right translations .",

    "* lemma 6.4.18 ) , if @xmath5 is a compact @xmath6-dimensional contractible manifold ( see appendix  [ ssec : cicf : ma ] for the definition ) , all the betti numbers @xmath171 vanish , i.e. @xmath1077 , and @xmath180 .",
    "contractibility is , however , an excessivily strong constraints to ensure the equivalence of closeness and exactness . for @xmath0-forms of a given degree @xmath0 ,",
    "the vanishing of just the betti number , @xmath170 is actually sufficient .",
    "let us remark that from the duality between the finite - dimensional vector spaces @xmath1074 and @xmath1072 exactness of @xmath0-form can be determined from the topological properties of @xmath5 .    the laplace - de rham operator @xmath1078 is defined by @xmath1079 .",
