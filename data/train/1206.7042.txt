    "in mean - field theories , electromagnetic transition rates are often evaluated using the rotational formula@xcite to relate them to the multipole moments of the mean - field wave functions .",
    "the formula is justified by factorizing the wave function as a product of a wave function for the orientation angles times an intrinsic wave function and assuming that the matrix elements between intrinsic states at different orientations vanish . from a more microscopic point of view",
    ", the formula can be obtained as the strong deformation limit of the transition probability computed with angular momentum projected wave functions @xcite .",
    "there are several studies in the literature investigating the validity of the rotational formula in well deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know there has never been a systematic study of the validity and eventual breakdown of the rotational formula as the wave function approaches the spherical limit .",
    "a motivation for this study is the wide - spread use of this formula even outside of its domain of validity .",
    "for example , the increasing popularity of the bohr hamiltonian @xcite as a tool to handle low energy vibrational and rotational properties in a mean - field framework calls for a careful analysis of the limitations of the rotational formula for @xmath1 transition strengths@xcite .",
    "often near - spherical configurations have a non - negligible amplitude in the wave functions and their contribution to the transition strengths needs to be handled with care .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish criteria for the use of rotational formulas , as well as to find useful approximations simpler than the full angular momentum projection to deal with moderate and soft deformations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii below discusses the representation of the wave function at small deformations .",
    "our main result , derived in sect.iii , is an an expression for the transition strengths valid for small deformations eq .",
    "( [ eq : belsph ] ) below .",
    "this expression gives a non - zero value in the limit of vanishing deformation , in contrast with the rotational formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot ] ) below . in sect .",
    "iv we examine the validity of the formulas by comparing with full projections from the intrinsic states , taking a number of representative examples including quadrupole and octupole transitions . the dividing line separating the small and large deformation limits",
    "is seen to be closely connected to the the angular momentum content of the intrinsic wave function .",
    "this gives a simple criterion to identify the regions of validity of the rotational formula .",
    "we also find that the @xmath1 values can be simply parameterized as a function of the the quadrupole deformation parameter , eq .",
    "( [ eq : be2projapp ] ) below .",
    "other transition strengths like the @xmath2 will be discussed and we will see that similar considerations apply to them as well .    to set the notation , the multipole operators are defined as @xcite @xmath3 and the corresponding electric operators as @xmath4 the rotational formula for an axially symmetric intrinsic state is given by @xmath5",
    "the first step is the characterization of the intrinsic wave functions near sphericity .",
    "we will focus on quadrupole deformation because the generalization to other multipolarities is straightforward .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic wave functions are of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean - field type .",
    "the wave function @xmath6 is labeled by the components of the quadrupole moment @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the wave function can be expressed in terms of a suitable spherical reference state @xmath9 by means of the generalized thouless theorem @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a sum of 2-quasiparticle creation operators and @xmath12 is a normalization constant .",
    "given the bogoliubov amplitudes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 defining @xmath6 and @xmath9 ( see @xcite for notation ) the explicit form of @xmath11 can be obtained ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , we only need to assume for the formal development below that @xmath17 can be expanded as a power series in @xmath18 , @xmath19 the phases are introduced for consistency with the following properties of the deformation parameters @xmath20 .",
    "it also implies that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the tensor character of the multipole operators implies that the deformation parameters of the rotated wave function @xmath23 also behave as the components of a spherical tensor @xmath24 to be consistent with this property , the operator @xmath25 must transform under rotations as @xmath26 the corresponding transformation properties of the operators @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 this property makes it possible to decompose the operator as the direct sum of spherical tensors @xmath29 in the present example the range of the spherical tensors @xmath30 is @xmath31 . using the same kind of arguments",
    "it is easy to show that the @xmath32and @xmath33 operators must be even under parity .",
    "the generalization to an arbitrary multipolarity @xmath34 is straightforward ; we consider the case @xmath35 in more detail below .",
    "close to the spherical limit , the deformation parameters of the intrinsic wave function are small and we can expand @xmath6 to second order in @xmath36 . the wave function is then projected on good angular momentum using the projection operator @xmath37 and the transformation properties of the @xmath38 operators . the ground state @xmath39 is obtained by projecting with @xmath40 .",

    "it will be written as @xmath53 which is a notation reminiscent of the reduced matrix elements of the wigner - eckart theorem . with this definition",
    "we finally obtain the expression for the normalized excited state wave function @xmath54 the wave function @xmath47 is well defined in the @xmath55 limit and is a linear combination of 2-quasiparticle excitations of the spherical state .",

    "this is a clear indication of the inadequacy of the rotational formula for the evaluation of transition strengths near sphericity .",
    "the quantities entering eqs ( [ eq : be2sph ] ) and ( [ eq : belsph ] ) can be calculated in linear response theory , but it is rather easy to calculate them using the intrinsic states of the hfb theory .",

    "we used this formula recently in a global study of octupole correlations @xcite to understand some discrepancies observed in the comparison with experimental data .",
