    "from the inception of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) @xcite as an instrument for _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ it was appreciated that the combination of a single bounce reflection grating with the large geometric collecting area ( @xmath0 40,000 @xmath1 ) , and the @xmath0 15 % reflectivity at 1000   of the magnesium fluoride over - coated aluminum ( mgf@xmath4/al ) mirrors @xcite , could provide useful sensitivity in the far - uv bandpass between the rather sharp mgf@xmath4/al discontinuity at @xmath0 1150   and the lyman edge at 912  . the possibility that cos could work below 1150",
    "  was intriguing because of the potential for new science .",
    "a low spectral resolution far - uv channel could be used for new studies of the steeply increasing populations of faint galaxies and quasars not detectable with the higher spectral resolution channels offered by the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "fuse_. moreover , _ fuse _ is no longer operational and as such the community has lost its window on a set of critical spectral diagnostics , such as for h@xmath4 and , that are only available below 1150  .",
    "the cos instrument team found that the windowless detector design and the low resolution g140l grating @xmath7 2000 , lent itself easily to the inclusion of a non - optimized far - uv channel in detector segment b , spanning @xmath8 100 - 1100  .",
    "its expected effective area was anticipated to be about 100 - 200 times lower @xcite than that of cos longward of 1150  . however , this estimation was uncertain .",
    "it was known that upon return to earth the wfpc-1 pickoff mirror had been severely contaminated during its time on orbit with a normal incidence reflection of @xmath8 75% at 1500  , falling to @xmath0 1 % at 1216 @xcite .",
    "the use of the g140l segment b was unsupported for the _ hst _ cycle 17 round of proposals , because of the unknown level of contamination that the _ hst _ optical telescope assembly ( ota ) had suffered in the nearly 20 years since its launch .",
    "here we present the first evidence that any ota mirror contamination in the far - uv is inconsequential and that in fact the sensitivity below 1000   rivals that of the silicon carbide channels on _ fuse _ @xcite .",
    "we discuss some new science opportunities enabled by this new capability and conclude that `` lyman limited '' instrumentation is a fesible option for future large aperture uv telescopes .",
    "on 04 september 2009 the hot da white dwarf wd 0320 - 539 ( gsc 08493 - 00891 , t@xmath9 = 32.9 k , @xmath10 = 7.89 , @xmath11 = 14.9 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was observed in the g140l channel of cos as part of an external detector flat - field program , number 11491 .",
    "the data were acquired in 3 focal plane split ( fp / split ) observations , each 640 seconds long , yielding a total on target time of 1920 seconds .",
    "standard pipeline processing @xcite was used to combine the two - dimensional images of the three separate fp / split spectra into a single contiguous spectrum , the so called ` \" * _ corrtag_b.fits \" ` image , from which we performed a manual extraction and analysis .",
    "we report here only on the segment b spectrum .",
    "this object has also been observed several times by _ fuse _ at a resolving power @xmath12 20,000 .",
    "the spectrum , provided through mast , incorporates the final _ fuse _ calibration @xcite and will serve as our absolute calibration reference .",
    "the data files for the cos and fuse spectra used in this work are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the spectra for wd 0320 - 539 were extracted from the two - dimensional fits files using a rectangular aperture 50 pixels high .",
    "counts with pulse heights @xmath13 3 and @xmath14 29 were eliminated .",
    "a detector background region , located 100 pixel below the object region , was similarly extracted and subtracted from the object . the g140l segment b wavelength scale is 0.08   pixel @xmath15 and there are approximately 6 pixels per resolution element .",
    "further information on the cos instrument can be found in an `` in preparation '' paper by green et al . , or by consulting the cos instrument handbook maintained by the space telescope science institute .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] we show the total count spectrum on a linear scale plotted from 900  1050  , using a linear wavelength solution . the progression of the pressure broadened lyman series characteristic of a high gravity hot white dwarf is evident .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum , smoothed by 100 pixels , rebinned to the g140l segment b wavelength grid and scaled by a constant factor of 8 @xmath16 10@xmath17 counts ( ergs @xmath18 s@xmath15 @xmath15)@xmath15 , is overplotted in blue .",
    "the count spectrum can be faithfully converted to the stellar flux for wd 0320 - 539 over most of the displayed bandpass using this constant factor , demonstrating the effective area is also nearly constant .",
    "there are some slight mismatches in the line shapes , but overall the agreement is excellent .    the effective area curve , shown on a semi - logarithmic scale in figure  [ fig2 ] , was derived simply by dividing the _ fuse _ spectrum into the cos count spectrum and applying the appropriate time ( @xmath19 = 1920 s ) , energy ( @xmath20 ) and dispersion ( @xmath21 = 0.08  ) scalings .",
    "a spline fit based on 13 points averaged over 3   intervals at wavelengths chosen to avoid the lyman series line cores ( @xmath22 = [ 918.5 , 924.5 , 934 , 944 , 962 , 1010 , 1050 , 1060 , 1080 , 1100 , 1130 , 1150 , 1170 ] was employed to estimate the effective area .",
    "points from the spline fit and associated errors , sampled on 20   intervals starting at 920  are presented in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we can estimate the amount of contamination that the ota has suffered by comparing a model of the effective area to these data . recall that the effective area is the product of the telescope geometric area , the reflectivity of each telescope mirror , the grating absolute efficiency and the detector efficiency .",
    "we use the measured mgf@xmath4/al reflectance ( 250   of mgf@xmath4 ) from @xcite for the mirrors . g140l",
    "absolute efficiency measurements were not available for the full far - uv wavelength range , so we used those available from @xcite to constrain a model computed as the product of the mgf@xmath4/al reflectance and a groove efficiency for a laminar profile @xcite .",
    "the cos detector qes measured by @xcite were further augmented with additional csi photocathode measurements at the short wavelengths from similar detectors by the same group .",
    "the dashed line on figure  [ fig2 ] is the resulting model for the effective area . multiplying our model by a factor @xmath0 0.6 produces a reasonable match to the g140l segment b effective area .",
    "if we assume that the ota carries the bulk of the disagreement and that the original reflectivity was similar to that of @xcite , then after accounting for the two reflections , we conclude the individual mirrors of the ota retain @xmath8 80  % of their original efficiency .",
    "the effective area of cos at wavelengths below 1000   is comparable to the effective area of _ fuse _ over the same bandpass and it exceeds that of _ fuse _ in the 1090  1180 bandpass @xcite . at present , the error bars at the short wavelength end are somewhat uncertain because of the monotonically decreasing count rate in our calibration object , caused by the overlap in the converging pressure broadened lyman series , but this situation will improve as further calibrations are acquired .",
    "the g140l has a resolving power of @xmath12 2000 , which is @xmath0 10 times lower than than the _ fuse _ resolution .",
    "as such , the detector background limit of the g140l segment b should be correspondingly lower provided the detector dark rate is similar to that realized by _ fuse_.",
    "the combination of reasonable effective area with low detector background will allow cos to pursue science left behind by _ fuse _ when the planned low spectral resolution channel was descoped . we briefly discuss some of these science opportunities here .",
    "for example , analysis of `` gunn - peterson '' absorption in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) carried out by _ fuse _ was conducted primarily on two quasar lines - of - sight he 2347 - 4342 and hs 1700 + 6416 @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _ observations in combination with absorption line studies from the ground demonstrated that fine - grained fluctuations in the metagalactic ionizing background are associated with source hardness , igm density voids and peaks . however , there is a critical need for multiple lines - of - sight to better constrain the cosmic variance in the evolution of these peaks and voids and in the redshift associated with the initiation of the reionization epoch near @xmath23 ( ) = 2.8 @xmath24 0.2 @xcite .    the higher sensitivity at low flux will also be beneficial to programs seeking to detect and quantify the fraction of lyman continuum photons that escape from star - forming galaxies at low redshift",
    "low redshift observations are essential @xcite to further our understanding of the physical processes responsible for the reionization epoch near @xmath23 ( ) = 6 thought to be caused by lyman continuum photons escaping from the first star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "cos will be probing clouds in the interstellar medium with total extinction @xmath25 3 where the long sought after transition from translucent to dense medium is expected to occur @xcite .",
    "one of the problems that these observing programs faced with the demise of _ fuse _ and the uncertain cos far - uv response was the lack of guaranteed access to the dominate cloud species , h@xmath4 , which has ground state absorption bands in the far - uv shortward of @xmath0 1110  .",
    "this is no longer a problem now that the cos g140l segment b has been shown to have useful sensitivity . it will now be possible , for the first time , to make direct studies of the co / h@xmath4 ratio @xcite in dense regimes more typical of those probed by co observations at radio wavelengths",
    "ultimately this could lead to more accurate estimations of molecular gas mass in star - forming galaxies .",
    "in addition to the enabled science investigations discussed above , spectral coverage below 1050   provides unique access to the @xmath6  1032 , 1038 resonance doublet .",
    "this transition is perhaps the best tracer of gas at @xmath26  @xmath8  few  @xmath16  10@xmath27 k in the uv - optical bandpass and can be used to constrain physical processes in a diverse range of galactic and intergalactic environments .",
    "we have demonstrated that there is significant response in the g140l segment b channel of cos shortwards of the mgf@xmath4/al discontinuity near 1100    extending all the way to the lyman edge .",
    "this low resolution far - uv capability is a unique instrumental mode that has never before been available to the astronomical community and as such has great potential for scientific discovery .",
    "the cos far - uv demonstration has implications for future facility class missions .",
    "we note that no effort was made to optimize the far - uv response of this channel .",
    "the use of a sic coated grating would provide a factor of two gain in efficiency .",
    "an additional factor of two would result through the use of a dual order spectrograph design @xcite or a blazed ion etched grating .",
    "we estimate that the efficiency of a properly optimized spectrograph on a general purpose 10 meter telescope , having a two bounce ota with standard mgf@xmath4/al mirrors , has the potential to achieve an effective area @xmath0 500 to 1000 @xmath28 in the far - uv , easily breaking the desired factor - of-10 threshold commonly used to assess the discovery potential of new observing modes @xcite .",
    "the cos observations presented here prove that such an approach is a viable option for large facility class missions and suggests that including a windowless far - uv channel below 1150   on future missions should be seriously considered .",
