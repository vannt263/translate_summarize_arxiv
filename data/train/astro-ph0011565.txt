    "the hyades open cluster has for most of the past century been an important calibrator of many astrophysical relations , e.g. , the absolute magnitude - spectral type and the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "the cluster has been the subject of numerous investigations ( e.g. , van bueren 1952 ; pels et al .  1975 ; reid 1993 ; perryman et al .  1998 ) addressing , e.g. , cluster dynamics and evolution , the distance scale in the universe ( e.g. , hodge & wallerstein 1966 ; van den bergh 1977 ) , and the calibration of spectroscopic radial velocities ( e.g. , petrie 1963 ; dravins et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the significance of the hyades is nowadays mainly limited to the broad field of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "open clusters in general form an ideal laboratory to study star formation , structure , and evolution theories , as their members are thought to have been formed simultaneously from the same molecular cloud material . as a result , they have ( 1 ) the same age , at least to within a few myr , ( 2 ) the same distance , neglecting the intrinsic size which is at maximum 1020  pc , ( 3 ) the same initial element abundances , and ( 4 ) the same space motion , neglecting the internal velocity dispersion which is similar to the velocity dispersion within the parental molecular cloud ( typically several tenths of a km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the hyades open cluster in particular is especially suitable and primarily has been used for detailed astrophysical studies because of its ( 1 ) proximity ( mean distance @xmath045  pc ) , also giving rise to several other advantages such as relatively bright stars and negligible interstellar reddening and extinction , ( 2 ) large proper motion ( @xmath12  mas  yr@xmath1 ) and peculiar space motion ( @xmath035  km  s@xmath1 with respect to its own local standard of rest ) , greatly facilitating both proper motion- and radial velocity - based membership determinations , and ( 3 ) varied stellar content ( @xmath0400 known members , among which are white dwarfs , red giants , mid - a stars in the turn - off region , and numerous main sequence stars , at least down to @xmath0@xmath13 m dwarfs ) .",
    "its proximity , however , has also always complicated astrophysical research : the tidal radius of @xmath010  pc results in a significant extension of the cluster on the sky ( @xmath020@xmath14 ) and , more importantly , a significant depth along the line of sight . as a result , the precise definition and location of the main sequence and turn - off region in the hertzsprung",
    " russell ( hr ) diagram , and thereby , e.g. , accurate knowledge of the helium content and age of the cluster , has always been limited by the accuracy and reliability of distances to individual stars .",
    "unfortunately , the distance of the hyades is such that ground - based parallax measurements , such as the yale programme ( e.g. , van altena et al .",
    "1995 ) , have never been able to settle ` the hyades distance problem ' definitively .",
    "the above situation improved dramatically with the publication of the hipparcos and tycho catalogues ( esa 1997 ) . in 1998 ,",
    "perryman and collaborators ( hereafter p98 ) published a seminal paper in which they presented the hipparcos view of the hyades .",
    "p98 studied the three - dimensional spatial and velocity distribution of the members , the dynamical properties of the cluster , including its overall potential and density distribution , and its hr diagram and age . at the mean distance of the cluster ( @xmath15  pc ) , a typical hipparcos parallax uncertainty of 1",
    "mas translates into a distance uncertainty of @xmath16  pc . because this uncertainty compares favorably with the tidal radius of the hyades ( @xmath010  pc ) ,",
    "the hipparcos distance resolution is sufficient to study details such as mass segregation (  7.1 in p98 ) .",
    "uncertainties in absolute magnitudes , on the other hand , are still dominated by hipparcos parallax errors ( @xmath170.10  mag ) and not by photometric errors ( @xmath20.01  mag ;  9.0 in p98 ) .",
    "kinematic modelling of collective stellar motions in moving groups can yield improved parallaxes for individual stars from the hipparcos proper motions ( e.g. , dravins et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; de bruijne 1999b ; hereafter b99b ) .",
    "such parallaxes , called ` secular parallaxes ' , are more precise than hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes for individual hyades as the relative proper motion accuracy is effectively @xmath03 times larger than the relative hipparcos parallax accuracy .",
    "p98 discuss secular parallaxes for the hyades ( their  6.1 and figures  1011 ) , but only in view of their statistical consistency with the trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "improved hr diagrams , based on hipparcos secular parallaxes , have been published on several occasions , but these diagrams merely served as external verification of the quality and superiority of the secular parallaxes ( e.g. , madsen 1999 ; b99b ) .",
    "narayanan & gould ( 1999a , b ) derived secular parallaxes for the hyades , but used these only to study the possible presence and size of systematic errors in the hipparcos data .",
    "although narrow main sequences are readily observable for distant clusters , the absolute calibration of the hr diagram of such groups is often uncertain due to their poorly determined distances and the effects of interstellar reddening and extinction .",
    "the latter problems are alleviated significantly for nearby clusters , but a considerable spread in the location of individual members in the hr diagram is introduced as a result of their resolved intrinsic depths .",
    "hipparcos secular parallaxes for hyades members provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously obtain a well - defined and absolutely calibrated hr diagram . in this paper",
    "we derive secular parallaxes for the hyades using a slightly modified version of the procedure described by b99b (  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "sections [ sec : space_motion ] and [ sec : additional_members ] discuss the space motion and velocity dispersion of the hyades , as well as membership of the cluster , respectively .",
    "the secular parallaxes are derived and validated in   [ sec : sec_pars ] and [ sec : acc_and_prec ] .",
    "the validation includes a detailed investigation of the velocity structure of the cluster and of the presence of small - angular - scale correlations in the hipparcos data .",
    "the three - dimensional spatial structure of the hyades , based on secular parallaxes , is discussed briefly in ",
    "[ sec : spatial_structure ] .",
    "readers who are primarily interested in the secular parallax - based colour - absolute magnitude and hr diagrams can turn directly to  [ sec : cmd ] ; we analyze these diagrams in detail , and also address related issues such as the transformation from observed colours and magnitudes to effective temperatures and luminosities , in   [ sec : cmd][sec : hrd ] .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] summarizes and discusses our findings .",
    "appendices a and b present observational data and discuss details of the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters for the hyades red giants and for the @xmath6 scuti pulsator @xmath7  tau .",
    "we define a moving group ( or cluster ) as a set of stars which share a common space motion @xmath18 to within the internal velocity dispersion @xmath19 .",
    "the canonical formula , based on the classical moving cluster / convergent point method , to determine secular parallaxes @xmath20 from proper motion vectors @xmath21 , neglecting the internal velocity dispersion , reads ( e.g. , bertiau 1958 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of one astronomical unit in kilometers to the number of seconds in one julian year ( esa 1997 , vol .  1 , table  1.2.2 ) and @xmath24 is the angular distance between a star and the cluster apex .",
    "we express parallaxes in units of mas ( milli - arcsec ) and proper motions in units of mas  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the derivation of secular parallaxes for hyades ( or taurus cluster ) members from proper motions and/or radial velocities using eq .",
    "( [ eq : canonical ] ) dates back to at least boss ( 1908 ; cf .",
    "smart 1939 ; see turner et al .",
    "1994 for a review ) .",
    "several authors have criticized such studies for various reasons ( e.g. , seares 1945 ; brown 1950 ; upton 1970 ; hanson 1975 ; cf .",
    "cooke & eichhorn 1997 ) ; the ideal method _ simultaneously _ determines the individual parallaxes and the cluster bulk motion , as well as the corresponding velocity dispersion tensor , from the observational data .",
    "murray & harvey ( 1976 ) developed such a procedure , and applied it to subsets of hyades members .",
    "zhao & chen ( 1994 ) presented a maximum likelihood method for the simultaneous determination of the mean distance ( and dispersion ) and kinematic parameters ( bulk motion and velocity dispersion ) of moving clusters , and also applied it to the hyades .",
    "cooke & eichhorn ( 1997 ) presented a method for the simultaneous determination of the distances to hyades and the cluster bulk motion .",
    "the hipparcos data recently raised renewed interest in secular parallaxes .",
    "dravins et al .",
    "( 1997 ) developed a maximum likelihood method to determine secular parallaxes based on hipparcos positions , trigonometric parallaxes , and proper motions , taking into account the correlations between the astrometric parameters ( cf .",
    " 2 in b99b ) .",
    "the algorithm assumes that the space velocities of the @xmath25 cluster members follow a three - dimensional gaussian distribution with mean @xmath18 , the cluster space motion , and standard deviation @xmath19 , the ( isotropic ) one - dimensional internal velocity dispersion ; the three components of @xmath18 correspond to the icrs equatorial cartesian coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( esa 1997 , vol .  1 , ",
    "the model has @xmath29 unknown parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the @xmath25 secular parallaxes .    after maximizing the likelihood function",
    ", one can determine the non - negative model - observation discrepancy parameter @xmath30 for each star ( eq .  8 in b99b ) . as the @xmath30 s are approximately distributed as @xmath31 with 2 degrees of freedom ( dravins et al .",
    "1997 ; b99b ; cf.lindegren et al .",
    "2000 ; makarov et al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath32 is a suitable criterion for detecting outliers .",
    "therefore , the procedure can be iterated by rejecting deviant stars ( e.g. , undetected close binaries or non - members ) and subsequently re - computing the maximum likelihood solution , until convergence is achieved in the sense that all remaining stars have @xmath33 . by definition ,",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate of the velocity dispersion @xmath19 decreases during this process .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that this iterative procedure can lead to underestimated values of @xmath19 by as much as @xmath34  km  s@xmath1 for hyades - like groups ( b99b ) .",
    "a wealth of ground - based radial velocity information was accumulated for the hyades over the last century .",
    "the cluster has an extent on the sky that is large enough to allow an accurate derivation of its three - dimensional space motion based on proper motion data exclusively ( e.g. , de bruijne 1999a , b ; hoogerwerf & aguilar 1999 ) .",
    "we nonetheless decided to modify the maximum likelihood procedure (  [ subsec : outline ] ) so as to enforce global consistency between the maximum likelihood estimate of the radial component of the cluster space motion and the spectroscopic radial velocity data as a set .",
    "therefore , we multiplied the astrometric likelihood merit function @xmath35 ( eq .  6 in b99b ) by a radial velocity penalty factor:-0.55truecm @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the median value of @xmath38 @xmath39 , computed over all stars with a ( reliable ) radial velocity (  [ subsec : space_motion ] ) , where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 denote the equatorial coordinates of a star .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is the allowed inconsistency in @xmath37 .",
    "we choose @xmath43 , which corresponds to @xmath0@xmath44  km  s@xmath1 when expressed in terms of the median effective radial velocity uncertainty @xmath45  km  s@xmath1 (  [ subsec : space_motion ] ) .    in order to work around the @xmath19 bias mentioned in ",
    "[ subsec : outline ] , we decided to introduce a second modification of the original procedure .",
    "this change involves the decoupling of the determination of the cluster motion plus velocity dispersion (  [ sec : space_motion ] ) from the determination of the secular parallaxes and goodness - of - fit parameters @xmath30 given the cluster velocity and dispersion (  [ sec : sec_pars ] ; cf .",
    "narayanan & gould 1999a , b ) .",
    "we thus reduce the dimensionality of the problem from @xmath46 to @xmath25 ( cf .",
    " [ sec : space_motion ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath25-dimensional maximum likelihood problem of finding @xmath25 secular parallaxes and goodness - of - fit parameters @xmath30 for a given space motion and velocity dispersion simplifies directly to @xmath25 independent one - dimensional problems (  2 in b99b ) .",
    "this leads to three additional advantages : ( 1 ) it reduces the computational complexity of the problem ; ( 2 ) it allows an a posteriori decision on the @xmath30 rejection limit (  [ subsec : outline ] ) ; and ( 3 ) it allows a treatment on the same footing of stars lacking trigonometric parallax information , such as hyades selected from the tycho2 catalogue (  [ subsec : faint_mems ] ) . in practice , the analysis of such stars only requires the reduction of the dimensionality of the vector of observables @xmath47 and the corresponding vector @xmath48 and matrices * c*@xmath49 and * d * from 3 to 2 and @xmath50 to @xmath51 , respectively , through suppression of the first component ( see  2 in b99b ) .",
    "the procedure outlined in   [ subsec : outline][subsec : revision ] is based on two basic assumptions , namely that ( 1 ) the cluster velocity field is known accurately , and ( 2 ) the astrometric measurements of the stars correctly reflect their true space motions .",
    "assumption ( 2 ) can be safely met by excluding from the analysis ( close ) multiple systems , spectroscopic binaries , etc .",
    "(  [ subsec : faint_mems ] ) . assumption",
    "( 1 ) requires a careful analysis , to which we will return in  [ subsec : vel_field ] . for the moment",
    ", it suffices to say that there exist neither conclusive observational evidence nor theoretical predictions that the velocity field of , at least the central region of , the hyades cluster is non - gaussian with an anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "we opt to define the space motion and velocity dispersion of the hyades based on a well - defined set of secure members .",
    "p98 used the hipparcos positions , parallaxes , and proper motions , complemented with ground - based radial velocities if available , to derive velocities for individual stars in order to establish membership based on the assumption of a common space motion .",
    "p98 identified 218 candidate members , all of which are listed in their table  2 ( i.e. , column ( x ) is ` 1 ' or ` ? ' ) .",
    "we take these stars , and exclude all objects without radial velocity information ( i.e. , column ( p ) is ` @xmath52 ' ) and all ( candidate ) close binaries ( i.e. , either column ( s ) is ` sb ' ( spectroscopic binary ) or column ( u ) is one of ` g@xmath53o@xmath53v@xmath53x@xmath53s ' ; see esa 1997 for the definition of the hipparcos astrometric multiplicity fields h59 and h61 ) .",
    "this leaves 131 secure single members with high - quality astrometric and radial velocity information  km  s@xmath1 (  3.2 in p98 ; finding confirmed by j.c .",

    "<S> hipparcos parallaxes fix distances to individual stars in the hyades cluster with an accuracy of @xmath06  percent . </S>",
    "<S> we use the hipparcos proper motions , which have a larger relative precision than the trigonometric parallaxes , to derive @xmath03 times more precise distance estimates , by assuming that all members share the same space motion . </S>",
    "<S> an investigation of the available kinematic data confirms that the hyades velocity field does not contain significant structure in the form of rotation and/or shear , but is fully consistent with a common space motion plus a ( one - dimensional ) internal velocity dispersion of @xmath00.30  km  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the improved parallaxes as a set are statistically consistent with the hipparcos parallaxes . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum expected systematic error in the proper motion - based parallaxes for stars in the outer regions of the cluster ( i.e. , beyond @xmath02 tidal radii @xmath020  pc ) is @xmath20.30  mas . </S>",
    "<S> the new parallaxes confirm that the hipparcos measurements are correlated on small angular scales , consistent with the limits specified in the hipparcos catalogue , though with significantly smaller ` amplitudes ' than claimed by narayanan & gould . </S>",
    "<S> we use the tycho2 long time - baseline astrometric catalogue to derive a set of independent proper motion - based parallaxes for the hipparcos members .    </S>",
    "<S> the new parallaxes provide a uniquely sharp view of the three - dimensional structure of the hyades . </S>",
    "<S> the colour - absolute magnitude diagram of the cluster based on the new parallaxes shows a well - defined main sequence with two ` gaps'/`turn - offs ' . </S>",
    "<S> these features provide the first direct observational support of bhm  </S>",
    "<S> vitense s prediction that ( the onset of ) surface convection in stars significantly affects their @xmath3 colours . </S>",
    "<S> we present and discuss the theoretical hertzsprung  </S>",
    "<S> russell diagram ( @xmath4 versus @xmath5 ) for an objectively defined set of 88 high - fidelity members of the cluster as well as the @xmath6  scuti star @xmath7 tau , the giants @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 tau , and the white dwarfs v471 tau and hd 27483 ( all of which are also members ) . </S>",
    "<S> the precision with which the new parallaxes place individual hyades in the hertzsprung  </S>",
    "<S> russell diagram is limited by ( systematic ) uncertainties related to the transformations from observed colours and absolute magnitudes to effective temperatures and luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the new parallaxes provide stringent constraints on the calibration of such transformations when combined with detailed theoretical stellar evolutionary modelling , tailored to the chemical composition and age of the hyades , over the large stellar mass range of the cluster probed by hipparcos . </S>"
