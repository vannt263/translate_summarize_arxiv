    "besides the deuteron , polarized @xmath2he appears to be a useful target to extract information on the electromagnetic neutron form factors .",
    "this proposal goes back to  @xcite and has been emphasized again by  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fact that the principal s - state dominates the @xmath2he wave function by more than 90  % and in this state the polarization is carried solely by the neutron . needless to say that the knowledge of the electromagnetic form factors of the neutron is basic to get insight into the distribution of charge and magnetization inside the neutron .",
    "we refer to  @xcite and  @xcite for experimental and theoretical work on that topic extracting information on the neutron form factors . in this article",
    "we would like to analyze two experiments  @xcite on the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the aim to extract the magnetic and electric neutron form factors at certain @xmath3 values .",
    "this theoretical analysis will be based on faddeev solutions for the 3n continuum and the 3n bound state belonging to the same 3n hamiltonian",
    ". we shall also use realistic nn forces . for the inclusive process we carried through an analysis before  @xcite , but",
    "now it refers to a new more accurate experiment  @xcite and also the theory will be improved by including mesonic exchange currents .",
    "the analysis  @xcite of the exclusive experiment by consistent faddeev solutions for the 3n continuum and @xmath2he has not been done before to the best of our knowledge .    in section  [ secii ]",
    "we shall investigate the inclusive process and in section  [ seciii ] the exclusive one .",
    "we close with an outlook in section  [ seciv ] .",
    "in this section we shall analyze a measurement of @xmath0 carried through at jlab  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for the detailed theoretical formalism and restrict ourselves to describe only its extensions .",
    "that article will henceforth be cited as i and equations thereof by ( i. * ) . in i",
    "we used only a single nucleon current operator .",
    "now we add two - body exchange current operators .",
    "the central faddeev - like equation given in eq .",
    "( i.28 ) is derived under the assumption that the operator @xmath4 has the form of ( i.29 ) . in i",
    "this simply meant that @xmath4 is a sum of three single particle operators .",
    "however , what really enters the derivation of eq .",
    "( i.28 ) is , that the operator @xmath4 can be decomposed into three parts such that @xmath5 is symmetrical under exchange of particles @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the operator @xmath4 has the physical meaning of a component of the current operator .",
    "thus we can simply add two - body currents , which naturally decompose in a 3n system into three parts and therefore @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( i.28 ) will be now a sum of two terms : @xmath9 the first term is the single - nucleon current used in i and @xmath10 is the corresponding component of a two - body current acting on particles 2 and 3 . as a consequence there will occur now an additional driving term in eq .",
    "( i.28 ) of the form @xmath11 .",
    "the following steps in i concern the partial wave representation",
    ". since the spherical components @xmath12 of the two - body current operator are tensor operators and behave like the single nucleon components used in i , the conditions  ( i.36 - 37 ) and as a consequence ( i.38 ) remain valid . the symmetry properties  ( i.41 - 44 ) based on the partial wave decomposed forms remain also valid for the additional two - body currents .",
    "this follows from their explicit forms as given in  @xcite",
    ". then the following expressions leading to the final forms of the four response functions  ( i.52 - 55 ) remain valid .",
    "for the two - body currents we follow the riska prescription  @xcite , which via the continuity equation relates nn forces and exchange currents in a model independent manner , as it is often referred to .",
    "we choose the av18 nn force model  @xcite and restrict ourselves to the dominant @xmath13- and @xmath14-like parts .",
