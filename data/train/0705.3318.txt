    "the investigation of orbital degrees of freedom has become an important field in theoretical solid - state physics over the past two decades .",
    "there are a number of materials which are believed to show phase transitions with orbital order parameters . among them , the perovskite manganites , e.g. , @xmath0 , have attracted particular interest because of the colossal magnetoresistance behaviour which is observed in these materials . in theoretical studies on manganites ,",
    "one often neglects the almost localised mn @xmath1 orbitals and investigates solely the electronic properties of a systems with two @xmath2 orbitals per lattice site . in order to study the ferromagnetic phase of such a model , takahashi and shiba @xcite further neglected the spin - degrees of freedom because the hund s rule coupling is assumed to align the spins in the two @xmath2  orbitals .",
    "the mean - field study in @xcite found a surprisingly large number of stable orbitally ordered phases for the spinless @xmath2 model .",
    "however , it is well known that mean - field approximations tend to overestimate the stability of ordered phases in correlated electron systems .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this work is to reinvestigate the two - orbital hubbard model without spin - degrees of freedom by means of the gutzwiller variational many - body theory .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : the hamiltonian and the different types of order parameters that we are going to investigate are discussed in section  2 . in section",
    "3 we introduce gutzwiller wave functions and derive an approximate expression for the variational ground - state energy .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  4 and a brief summary closes our presentation in section  5 .",
    "we investigate a two - orbital ( @xmath2-type ) hubbard model @xcite without spin - degrees of freedom , @xmath3 here , the tight - binding parameters @xmath4 describe hopping processes between orbitals @xmath5 on cubic lattice sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is formally equivalent to the standard one - band hubbard model if the indices @xmath5 are regarded as spins .",
    "however , the tight - binding parameters in ( [ 1b ] ) would be unusual for a genuine one band model since they contain inter - orbital hopping - terms .",
    "the hubbard parameter @xmath8 in ( [ 1c ] ) is derived from @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coulomb and the exchange interaction between electrons in different @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "we restrict our investigation to systems with only nearest neighbour hopping since additional hopping terms would only destabilise the orbital order we are interested in . for @xmath2 orbitals @xmath12 , @xmath13 and hopping parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite ,",
    "the one - particle hamiltonian in momentum space reads @xmath16 with @xcite @xmath17 the @xmath18-integrated density of states @xmath19 that results from this band structure is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    )",
    ".,width=264 ]    for our investigation of orbital order we need to introduce two more basis representations of the orbital space , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the dispersion relations in momentum space for the ` @xmath22'- and the ` @xmath23'-basis become @xmath24 the interaction term ( [ 1c ] ) has the same form for all three basis representations @xmath25 .",
    "we describe orbital order in our model system ( [ 1 ] ) through the parameters @xmath26 for each of the three representations @xmath27 . by using the pauli matrices",
    "@xmath28 the order parameter can also be written as ( compare reference @xcite ) @xmath29    besides the orbital character of the order - parameter we need to specify its lattice site dependence . following reference",
    "@xcite we consider orders of the form @xmath30 with commensurate vectors @xmath31 which belong to the @xmath32 point ( @xmath33 ) , the @xmath34 point ( @xmath35 ) , the @xmath36 point ( @xmath37 ) , and the @xmath38 point ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the real parameter @xmath40 in ( [ 10 ] ) is independent of the lattice site vector @xmath6 and assumed to be positive .",
    "note , that for vectors @xmath41 equation ( [ 10 ] ) divides the lattice into an ` @xmath42'-lattice with a majority @xmath43 occupation ( @xmath44 ) , and a ` @xmath45'-lattice with a majority @xmath46 occupation ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "for an investigation of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) we use gutzwiller variational wave functions @xcite which are defined as @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is a normalised quasi - particle vacuum and the local correlator has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 projects onto the four local configuration states @xmath52 , i.e. , the empty state @xmath53 , the doubly occupied state @xmath54 and the two single electron states @xmath55 .",
    "note , that @xmath56 and @xmath57 depend on the orbital representation @xmath27 whereas the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are invariant under the orbital transformations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) . for the variational parameters",
    "@xmath58 we make an ansatz which is consistent with the spatial symmetry of the order parameter , @xmath59 where the parameters @xmath60,@xmath61 , @xmath62,@xmath63 are independent of the lattice site vector @xmath6 .",
    "a more general ansatz for the gutzwiller correlator @xmath64 which also includes non - diagonal configuration transfer operators @xmath65 has been studied in reference @xcite . as we will see below ( section [ 3.2 ] ) , it is sufficient for our calculations in this work to consider only diagonal operators in @xmath66 .      for any practical use of a variational wave - function",
    "it is essential that the expectation value of the hamilton can be calculated .",
    "however , despite the simplicity of the gutzwiller wave - function the evaluation of @xmath67 poses a difficult many - particle problem that can not be solved in general .",
    "gutzwiller introduced an approximate evaluation scheme that was based on quasi - classical counting arguments .",
    "more recent derivations of this approximation can be found in references @xcite .",
    "analytically exact evaluations were later found to be possible in one dimension @xcite , and in infinite spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "the results of the latter evaluation turned out to be equivalent to the gutzwiller approximation for systems which can be studied within this approach .",
    "the evaluation scheme in infinite dimensions was later generalised for the investigation of multi - band hubbard models @xcite and superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "we will use these exact results in infinite dimensions as an approximation in order to evaluate expectation values of our hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we only consider single - particle wave functions @xmath68 in ( [ 15 ] ) for which the local density matrix @xmath69 with the matrix elements @xmath70 is diagonal with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "finite non - diagonal elements in @xmath69 could only appear if we were mixing different order parameters .",
    "as shown in @xcite the four parameters @xmath58 for a lattice site @xmath71 have to obey the constraints @xmath72 our correlation operator ( [ 16 ] ) automatically fulfils the constraints ( [ 30b ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "this is the reason why it was allowed in the first place to include only diagonal operators @xmath74 in ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "consequently , instead of ( [ 30b ] ) we only need to consider the diagonal constraints @xmath75 all constraints can be solved explicitly if we use the results for local expectation values @xmath76 which hold in infinite spatial dimensions . with ( [ 34 ] )",
    "we can use the expectation values @xmath77 as new variational parameters instead of @xmath58 .",
    "the constraints then read @xmath78 and can be readily solved by expressing all local occupancies in terms of the average numbers of doubly occupied sites @xmath79 , @xmath80 apart from the still unspecified one particle wave function @xmath81 and the corresponding local density matrices @xmath82 the probabilities @xmath79 are the only remaining variational parameters .",
    "note , that ( [ 27 ] ) leads to @xmath83 for the orbital densities in the correlated gutzwiller wave - function .",
    "we skip the explicit declaration of the orbital representation @xmath27 for the rest of this chapter and write @xmath84 instead of @xmath85 in all indices .    in infinite dimensions",
    "the expectation value of the one particle hamiltonian ( [ 1b ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath86 where we introduced the well known gutzwiller loss factors @xcite @xmath87 and @xmath88 is defined via @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the lattice symmetry of the order parameter leads to further simplifications .",
    "we introduce the majority and the minority orbital density @xmath91 such that @xmath92 the upper and lower signs in ( [ 30 ] ) , and in corresponding equations below , belong to lattice sites @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . for the other local expectation values",
    "we find @xmath95 a similar notation is introduced for the @xmath96-factors @xmath97 where @xmath98 the expectation value ( [ 28 ] ) splits into four components @xmath99 which belong to the four different hopping channels between majority ( ` @xmath100 ' ) and minority ( ` @xmath101 ' ) states . in momentum space , the one - particle expectation values in ( [ 35 ] ) can be written as @xmath102 where @xmath103 represent the @xmath100 or @xmath101 signs and the coefficients @xmath104 are given as the elements of the matrices @xmath105 for the evaluation of the expectation values in ( [ 40 ] ) we need to determine the one - particle wave function @xmath81 . following reference @xcite , @xmath81",
    "is given as the ground state of the effective one - particle hamiltonian @xmath106 where @xmath107 was introduced in ( [ 28 ] ) and the term proportional to the variational parameter @xmath108 allows to vary the order parameter @xmath109 .",
    "in this work , we only aim to investigate the stability of the orbitally unordered state .",
    "therefore we just need to analyse the energy expression ( [ 35 ] ) for small values of the order parameter @xmath109 .",
    "an expansion of the @xmath96-factors ( [ 33 ] ) up to second order in @xmath109 , @xmath110 yields @xmath111 note , that the coefficients @xmath112 are still functions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 . to",
    "leading order in @xmath109 the effective hamiltonian ( [ 50 ] ) becomes @xmath115 since we can set @xmath116 in @xmath117 , eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "the one - particle hamiltonian ( [ 55 ] ) is easily diagonalised numerically",
    ". this diagonalisation yields the coefficients in the quadratic expansion of ( [ 40 ] ) @xmath118 and , consequently , of the variational ground state energy @xmath119     ( straight ) , @xmath120 ( dashed ) , @xmath121 ( long - dashed ) , @xmath122 ( dotted ) , and @xmath123 ( dash - dotted ) .",
    "these phases are not stable within the gutzwiller theory.,width=415 ]    here , we introduced @xmath124 for @xmath125 or @xmath126 . the minimisation of @xmath127 with respect to @xmath114 can be carried out for @xmath128 @xmath129 and determines the optimum number @xmath130 of doubly occupied sites as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath113 .",
    "this allows the expansion of the variational energy purely in terms of @xmath109 @xmath131 a negative sign of the coefficient @xmath132 in ( [ 60 ] ) indicates the instability of the unordered state .",
    "note that a positive @xmath133 not necessarily proves the stability of the unordered state since it does not exclude first order transitions .    in hartree - fock theory a quadratic expansion of",
    "the ground - state energy leads to @xmath134 and the critical interaction strength in this approach is therefore given as @xmath135     ( straight ) , @xmath136 ( dashed ) , @xmath137 ( dotted ) , and @xmath138 ( dash - dotted ) . ,",
    "in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] we show the critical interaction strength  ( [ 62 ] ) in hartree - fock theory as a function of density for the various types of orbital order introduced in section  [ sec : hamilt ] .",
    "our data agree very well with those reported in reference  @xcite .",
    "note that in hartree - fock theory the critical interaction strength is finite for all densities @xmath139 and diverges only in the limit @xmath140 .",
    "the phases in figure [ fig2 ] are not stable within our correlated gutzwiller approach for all densities and interaction parameters .",
    "this holds in particular for the order parameter @xmath141 which has surprisingly small critical values @xmath142 around quarter filling @xmath143 .    for the four surviving phases ( figure [ fig3 ] ) we show the ratio @xmath144 of the critical parameters in gutzwiller and hartree - fock theory as a function of density in figure [ fig4 ] .",

    "this is in stark contrast to the hartree - fock findings in figure  [ fig3 ] . for three of the phases",
    "the orbital order may disappear again if @xmath8 exceeds some second critical value @xmath148 .",
    "this behaviour is also different from the hartree - fock theory in which the orbital order is stable for all @xmath149 .",
    "mathematically , the appearance of the second critical parameter @xmath150 is due to the fact that @xmath151 in ( [ 50b ] ) has a minimum as a function of @xmath152 .",
    "hence , the coefficient @xmath133 may have one or two roots as a function of @xmath8 , depending on the other parameters in ( [ 60b ] ) .",
    "the appearance of the second transition is therefore a genuine many - particle effect .",
    "only one of the four orders , @xmath137 , is unstable in the limit @xmath153 for all densities .",
    "for the three other orders we find critical densities @xmath154 with a stable order for all @xmath155 in the limit @xmath153 .",
    "the values of @xmath154 are displayed by arrows in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the failure of hartree - fock theory to describe the orbitally ordered phases of the two - band model is not surprising .",
    "it is well known , for example , that hartree - fock theory also grossly overestimates the stability of ferromagnetic ground states in the one - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism in this model requires very peculiar densities of states or very large local coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the simple stoner criterium of the hartree - fock theory , however , predicts ferromagnetism for all densities and for small coulomb interactions .",
    "orbital order in the two - band model at infinite @xmath8 has also been investigated in reference @xcite . in their work",
    "the authors report a complete disappearance of all types of orbital order seen in the hartree - fock theory .",
    "we have reported results for orbital order in a two - orbital hubbard - model without spin - degrees of freedom . in a previous work which was based on hartree - fock calculations",
    ", this system seemed to exhibit a surprisingly large variety of orbitally - ordered phases . in our study in this work",
    "we have employed the gutzwiller variational theory which is known to be more reliable than the hartree - fock theory for systems with medium to strong local coulomb interaction .",
    "most of the phases found in the hartree - fock approach turned out to be unstable in the gutzwiller - theory .",
    "orbital order only appears for densities near half filling in our calculation . unlike in hartree - fock theory",
    ", it may happen that an orbitally ordered phase which is stable for correlation parameters @xmath156 becomes unstable again if @xmath8 exceeds a second critical value @xmath148 .",
    "this second transition is a genuine many - particle effect .",
    "our findings show that the stability of phases with broken symmetry for correlated electron systems can be grossly overestimated by the hartree - fock mean - field theory .",
    "it is quite likely that similar problems appear in lda+u calculations where the local coulomb interaction is also treated on a hartree - fock level .",
