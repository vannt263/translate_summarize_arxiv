    "although a big bang universe is very successful , it predicts the existence of an initial singularity . to resolve such a difficulty",
    ", we have to search for new gravitation theory such as quantum gravity .",
    "however , we could so far not find it . as a first step to reach it",
    ", we may consider a mini - super space and quantize the isotropic and homogeneous universe , which is the so - called quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "vilenkin claimed that the universe is created from nothing @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the picture that the universe is spontaneously nucleated in a de sitter space .",
    "the mathematical description of this nucleation is analogous to a quantum tunneling through a potential barrier @xcite .",
    "another approach to quantum cosmology is developed by hartle and hawking @xcite , who proposed that the wave function of the universe is given by a path integral over non - singular compact euclidean geometries , which is called a `` no boundary '' boundary condition .",
    "when we discuss the early stage of the universe , however , a unified theory of fundamental interactions and particles will play a very important role . among such unified theories ,",
    "a string / m theory is the most promising candidate , which is constructed in higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "based on such higher - dimensional theories , new cosmological scenario has been proposed , that is a brane cosmology .",
    "the prototype of a brane world was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "combined it with the idea of d - brane found by polchinski in a string theory @xcite , a new paradigm of a brane world has been developed @xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum also proposed new brane models @xcite . in their second model @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the four - dimensional gravity is recovered even in an infinite bulk spacetime .",
    "it also provides new terms in the friedmann equation of a brane universe @xcite .",
    "the effective 4-dimensional ( 4d ) einstein equations with these new terms are obtained covariantly by projection of the 5-dimensional ( 5d ) spacetime onto the brane world @xcite , by which we understand naturally the origin of new terms .",
    "if we believe such higher - dimensional cosmological scenario , we have to invoke how such a universe is created .",
    "in particular , because a brane structure is highly inhomogeneous in a higher - dimensional bulk spacetime , we may wonder how such a brane universe is born and starts to evolve . as for creation of a brane universe ,",
    "a few works has been so far done .",
    "garriga and sasaki first constructed an inflating brane instanton of randall - sundrum model @xcite .",
    "this instanton is obtained by gluing two spherical parts of @xmath0 .",
    "hawking , hetrog and reall consider the creation using an instanton , and discuss inflation and a fluctuations during the de sitter phase in the model which contains the quantum correction term called a trace anomaly on the brane @xcite .",
    "the trace anomaly term is first discussed by starobinsky for inflation @xcite .",
    "another quantum correction term called induced gravity is introduced on the brane by dvali , gabadadze , and porrati @xcite .",
    "for this model , the effective gravitational equations on the brane are derived @xcite .",
    "this may provide new de sitter phase without a cosmological constant .",
    "when we discuss such quantum effects on the brane , we may also have to include quantum effects in the bulk . in the higher dimensional theory , the higher curvature correction terms",
    "should be added to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "these terms appear in the low energy effective action of string theory via quantum one - loop corrections .",
    "in fact the low energy effective actions of some sting theories include @xmath1 interactions , but this term gives rise to a ghost . in order to resolve this problem ,",
    "zwiebach @xcite ( also see @xcite ) introduce a ghost - free gauss - bonnet combination .",
    "hence , the gauss - bonnet term should be included when we discuss a brane universe with some quantum corrections .    for rs ii type model in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory",
    ", it is shown that the graviton zero mode is localized at low energies as in the original rs ii model and that the correction of the newton s law becomes milder by including the gauss - bonnet term @xcite .",
    "also the covariant effective 4d einstein equation is given by maeda and torii @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the creation of a brane universe using an instanton solution in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "we construct a brane instanton including a gauss - bonnet term . in ",
    "[ action - eqm ] , we present euclidean action and euclidean equations of motion in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory . in  [ instanton ] , we obtain the instanton solutions which 3-curvature is positive , zero or negative .",
    "we show that only for a closed model with positive curvature there exist instanton solutions either with a single brane or with two branes . for a flat or an open model",
    ", there does not exist any instanton solution with a single brane because of a boundary condition .",
    "we also calculate the value of the euclidean actions to discuss an initial state of a brane universe . in section [ trace - anomaly ]",
    "we consider the model including a trace anomaly term on the brane .",
    "we show there exists instanton solution with an inflating brane . in  [ conclusion ] , conclusion follows .",
    "the euclidean action for the brane world with gauss - bonnet term in the 5d space time is described by two parts : one in a bulk spacetime ( @xmath2 ) and the other in brane boundary hypersurfaces ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. @xmath4 the bulk action is given by @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the 5d gravitational constant , @xmath8 is a cosmological constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the 5d scalar curvature , ricci tensor and riemann tensor , respectively , and @xmath11 is a constant , which is related to a string coupling constant .",
    "the induced 4d metric @xmath12 on a 3-brane is defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spacelike unit vector field which normal to the brane hypersurface .",

    "@xmath17 is a tension on the @xmath18-th brane , @xmath19 is the extrinsic curvature of a brane , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the einstein tensor of the induced metric @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath22 is a trace of @xmath23 , which is given by some combination of the extrinsic curvature defined by @xmath24    the total action @xmath25 gives the field equations as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28   -\\frac{1}{2}g_{ab}{\\mathcal l}_{gb}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we are looking for an instanton solution , we assume a highly symmetric euclidean spacetime , which metric is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a 4d metric with maximal symmetry . this maximally symmetric 4d space is classified into three cases by the signature of curvature , i.e. @xmath310 ( zero ) , 1 ( positive ) , or @xmath32 ( negative )",
    ". it corresponds to the curvature sign of the friedmann universe after creation .",
    "since the euclidian space must be compact when we discuss its creation , in the case of @xmath33=0 or @xmath32 , we have to make a space compact by identification . then the flat spacetime is a 4d torus , and that with @xmath34 has more complicated topology .",

    "while for a single brane model , we use @xmath55 standing for a brane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "note that since the trace anomaly always vanishes for a flat brane , the flat two - brane model at any distance is possible .",
    "we have presented instanton solutions in the model with a gauss - bonnet term .",
    "if a brane is a closed universe , we find both two - brane and single - brane de sitter brane instantons . for a flat brane universe , we can also construct a two - brane instanton solution . as for a single - brane model , a compact bulk spacetime with a single brane",
    "is not possible because a flatness of the brane is not consistent with a no - boundary boundary condition .",
    "however , the rs ii type instanton with a non - compact bulk spacetime is allowed because its euclidean action is finite . for an anti - de sitter brane instanton with negative curvature",
    ", we can also construct only a two - brane instanton solution . in this case , the rs ii type instanton does not exist because the euclidean action diverges .",
    "although we find instanton solutions in the model with gauss - bonnet term , we can not predict the initial state of the brane universe .",
    "this is because the euclidian action has no minimum value . for a flat and an anti - de sitter brane , the volume of a created brane universe @xmath56",
    "is not fixed as well .",
    "@xmath56 can be arbitrary .",
    "as for the tension of a brane , although the critical tension requires a fine - tuning .",
    "we need such a choice to explain the present small value of the universe . such a tuning could be obtained in some super symmetric theories such as horava - witten model . here",
    "we assume such a tuned value , i.e. the critical tension .",
    "then we also include trace anomaly terms on the brane . in this case",
    ", we can predict the size of the universe . if we have a single - brane universe with no - boundary boundary condition , the created universe is in de sitter phase and naturally evolves into inflationary stage .    according to the recent analysis by charmousis and dufaux @xcite ,",
    "the models with a negative - tension brane show its instability in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "however such a problem is absent in the non - compact rs ii model . for de sitter brane instanton with two branes ,",
    "this instability may be smeared out by the existence of trace anomaly terms similarly to the inclusion of induced gravity term on the branes . furthermore in order to predict the initial state of created brane universe , we need to include other important effects such as the casimir energy , which are not taken into account here .",
    "these issues are left for a future study .",

    "first , we calculate a scalar curvature and a gauss - bonnet term using the metric ( [ emet ] ) as @xmath57 by using einstein equations ( [ eqm1 ] ) , we rewrite the bulk action ( [ eqm2 ] ) as @xmath58   \\nonumber \\\\    & = & -   \\frac{8v_4^{(k)}}{\\kappa^2_5 } \\int_{r_1}^{r_2 } dr    \\left [ \\lambda + 2\\frac{b''}{b } -3\\frac{k - b'^2}{b^2 } \\right ] . \\label{action_bulk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a single - brane model , we just replace the integration range @xmath59 $ ] with @xmath60 $ ] .",
