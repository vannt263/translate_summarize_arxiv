    "we count the number of ( equivalence classes of ) triangulations of a punctured @xmath9-gon , by describing an explicit correspondence to a certain class of rooted trees .",
    "a tree in this class is constructed by taking a family of full binary trees @xmath10 such that the total number of leaves is @xmath9 , and then adding a node @xmath11 and an edge from this node to the root of @xmath12 for each @xmath13 , such that @xmath11 becomes a root ( figure [ tree tree ] displays all such trees for @xmath14 ) .    when these rooted trees are considered up to rotation at the root , they are in 11 correspondence with the above mentioned equivalence classes of triangulations of the punctured @xmath9-gon .",
    "to count these rooted trees we use a simple adaption of a known formula found in @xcite and ( * ? ?",
    "* exercise 7.112 b ) .",
    "we also point out a mutation operation on these rooted trees , corresponding to the other mutation operations involved ( on triangulations and on quivers ) .",
    "our formula and the bijection to triangulations of the punctured @xmath9-gon were presented at the icra in torun , august 2007 @xcite .    after completing our work ,",
    "we learnt about the paper @xcite .",
    "they also generalize the methods in @xcite to prove the bijection from the mutation class of @xmath0 to triangulations of the punctured @xmath9-gon . however , their method of counting triangulations is very different from ours .",
