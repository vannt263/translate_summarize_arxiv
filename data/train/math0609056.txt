    "statisical theory usually assumes that data come from a distribution that is symmetric and unimodal at zero , such as a normal distribution or a student s @xmath2 distribution .",
    "however , it is common in real - life applications that underlying distribution of response variable , even though unimodal , may not be symmetric about its mode which is different from zero . for more information , see dharmadhikari and joag - dev ( 1988 ) and bertin , cuculescu and theodorescu ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is a vast amount of literature on nonparametric estimations of unimodal densities and the mode from a frequentist viewpoint including early works of granander  ( 1956 ) , parzen  ( 1962 ) , chernoff  ( 1964 ) , robertson  ( 1967 ) , venter  ( 1967 ) , prakasa rao  ( 1969 ) , wegman  ( 1969 , 1970a , 1970b , 1971 ) , other further studies by lye and martin  ( 1993 ) , bickel and fan  ( 1996 ) , wang  ( 1996 ) and birg  ( 1997 ) and among others .",
    "some recent methods are , for example , a recursive method in cheng , gasser , and hall  ( 1999 ) , kernel - based methods in hall and huang  ( 2001 , 2002 ) , and other parametric models in fernndez and steel  ( 1998 ) , jones  ( 2004 ) and ferreira and steel  ( 2006 ) .    from a bayesian viewpoint ,",
    "brunner  ( 1992 ) gave a nonparametric solution to the problems by assuming a mixture representation same as that in  ( [ mixture1 ] ) wherein the mixing distribution @xmath3 is a dirichlet process  ( ferguson ( 1973 ) ) for a unimodal density with a general mode @xmath4 on the real line @xmath5 .",
    "the posterior distribution and the bayes estimate of the unimodal density can be characterized in terms of random partitions  ( see , e.g , lo  ( 1984 ) and lo , brunner and chan  ( 1996 ) for these well - established theoretical results on dirichlet process mixture models ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to improving brunner s results and developing an efficient numerical method for practical usage of the bayes solutions .",
    "a class of unimodal densities with mode at @xmath4 of interest is defined by @xmath6 g(dx),\\qquad t \\in \\r,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the indicator of an event @xmath8 and @xmath3 is from the class of species sampling models developed in pitman  ( 1995 , 1996 ) , of which the dirichlet process is a member .",
    "all the results follow are therefore applicable to brunner s model as his model is a special case of  ( [ mixture1 ] ) .",
    "the validity of the mixture representation for all unimodal densities given in the right hand of  ( [ mixture1 ] ) can be justified by noting equality between its integral when @xmath9 and the distribution function of any unimodal density with mode at zero given in feller  ( 1971 , page  158 ) .",
    "the posterior distribution of  ( [ mixture1 ] ) , like brunner s model , can also be characterized in terms of random partitions , as the models are special cases of the species sampling mixture model defined in ishwaran and james  ( 2003 ) which takes the same form as  ( [ mixture1 ] ) with the kernel @xmath10 $ ] replaced by any density function in @xmath2 given @xmath4 and @xmath11 . in this work , by utilizing the special and nice features of the kernel in  ( [ mixture1 ] )  ( see  ( [ twocases ] ) ) and noticing irrelevancy of some information carried by a partition in characterizing the posterior distribution , we are able to refine the partition - based results to show that the unimodal densities possess special structures related to two @xmath0-paths , where an @xmath0-path is a random vector defined in brunner and lo  ( 1989 )  ( see also dykstra and laud  ( 1981 ) . generally speaking",
    ", there exists a tractable characterization of the posterior distribution via some combinatorial structures that are considerably less complex than partitions .",
    "such a characterization is known to be the first explicit type that is based on two @xmath0-paths .",
    "similar phenomena based on one single @xmath0-path could be found in bayes estimations of symmetric unimodal or decreasing densities by brunner and lo  ( 1989 ) , brunner  ( 1995 ) and ho  ( 2006b ) and monotone hazard functions by dykstra and laud  ( 1981 ) , lo and weng  ( 1989 ) and ho  ( 2006a ) , as the space of @xmath0-paths is considerably smaller than that of partitions  ( brunner and lo 1989 ) .",
    "intuitively , this characterization depending on two @xmath0-paths can be explained by the fact that there are two  ( possibly different ) non - increasing curves on each side of the mode in unimodal densities , but not only one  ( identical on either sides ) in symmetric unimodal densities of which can be characterized in terms of one @xmath0-path  ( albert  y.  lo , private conversation ) .",
    "it is recognized that if one could efficiently sample the two @xmath0-paths in this context , this would lead to more parsimonious methods for inference .",
    "motivated by the co - existence of and the resemblance in constructions of an sis algorithm and a gibbs sampler for sampling random partitions in many bayesian mixture models  ( lo , brunner and chan  ( 1996 ) and ishwaran and james  ( 2003 ) ) , we propose  ( in section  [ sec : sis ] ) a novel sequential importance sampling  ( sis ) method  ( kong , liu and wong  ( 1994 ) and liu and chen  ( 1998 ) ) , dubbed _ sequential importance path  ( sip ) sampler _ , for sampling directly one single @xmath0-path in the aforementioned models under monotonicity constraints by borrowing the idea behind the success of an efficient markov chain monte carlo  ( mcmc ) method introduced in ho  ( 2002 , 2006a , 2006b ) that serves the same purpose .",
    "then , a natural sis scheme based on applications of the sip sampler is introduced for sampling the unknown mode @xmath4 and the two @xmath0-paths in evaluating / approximating posterior quantities for models in  ( [ mixture1 ] ) .",
    "pitman  ( 1995 , 1996 ) developed the class of species sampling models that corresponds to the set of all random probability measure of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 are random weights such that @xmath14 , independently of @xmath15 , which are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with some non - atomic distribution @xmath16 over a measurable polish space , and @xmath17 is a dirac probability measure degenerate at @xmath15 .",
    "this class includes a large number of well - known random processes , for instance , the dirichlet process and its two - parameter extension , called the two - parameter poisson - dirichlet process  ( pitman and yor  ( 1997 ) ) , the class of finite - dimensional dirichlet priors discussed in detail in ishwaran and zarepour  ( 2002a , 2002b ) , and the homogeneous normalized random measures with independent increments discussed in regazzini , lijoi and prnster  ( 2003 ) .",

    "the above prediction rule conveys that given @xmath25 , which correspond to @xmath26 unique values @xmath27 of respective numbers of duplicates @xmath28 , then the next observation @xmath29 takes the same value as @xmath30 with probability @xmath23 , @xmath31 ; otherwise it takes a new value from @xmath16 with probability @xmath22 . as a consequence of the exchangeability of @xmath32 , pitman  ( 1996 ) shows that the distribution of @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath34 , is uniquely characterized by the joint law of its unique values and an exchangeable partition probability function  ( eppf ) @xmath35 induced by the unique values .",
