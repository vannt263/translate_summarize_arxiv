    "a significant component of space weather is the flux of solar energetic particles ( seps ) , accelerated during energy release events such as flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) at the sun .",
    "these high - energy charged particles can , after propagating to the earth , disrupt satellite communications and impact astronaut health and safety @xcite .",
    "charged particles propagating through interplanetary space are guided and deflected by the solar wind s magnetic field and its spatial and temporal variations .",
    "modern efforts in modeling space weather effects include performing numerical simulations to solve particle fluences at the earth based on parent active region and observer locations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the most common approach is to use a transport equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , where particles are effectively bound to the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) lines , described as the parker spiral @xcite .",
    "recent research ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) has shown that particle drifts , which are not modeled by a classical transport equation , play a significant role in sep propagation to the earth .",
    "they have been shown to be significant for protons and especially for heavier elements @xcite .",
    "other significant factors include field - line meandering @xcite and cross - field diffusion @xcite .",
    "one significant characteristic of the imf which has not been previously modeled in the context of sep propagation is the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) , providing the boundary between the two hemispheres of the solar dipole field .",
    "the presence of a current sheet changes motion of charged particles due imposing two distinct regions of drifts and the break - down of guiding centre motion at the sheet @xcite .",
    "the hcs is a vast area of space where the magnetic fields associated with the northern and the southern hemispheres of the solar magnetic field transition between outward and inward - directed polarities . due to the varying and complicated distribution of mean magnetic flux direction on the solar surface , and the tilt of the solar magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis ,",
    "the hcs consists of a complex 3d structure , especially at greater heliocentric distances .",
    "the hcs has been the topic of much research , but mainly from the point of view of very energetic particles called galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , propagating inwards from the outer boundary of the heliosphere ( references include , but are not limited to , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the role of the hcs in sep propagation has previously been briefly investigated in @xcite . in this paper , we present a first analysis of how the presence of the hcs affects the propagation of seps from the sun to the earth . we consider a flat current sheet and assess effects of current sheet thickness and different dipole configurations on sep propagation for protons of different energies .",
    "we also present sep time profiles at virtual observers , providing a basis of comparison with real observations .",
    "in this work , we model the hcs as a flat plane separating two hemispheres of opposite polarity , with each hemisphere based on a simple analytical magnetic field model .",
    "the imf is described through spherical heliocentric coordinates as a scaled parker spiral magnetic field @xmath0 @xmath1 where the parker field is defined as @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the field strength at @xmath4 , normalized to provide a field strength of @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the average solar rotation rate , @xmath7 is the radial solar wind speed and @xmath8 is a scaling function providing the change of polarity in a gradual fashion and describing current sheet thickness . due to @xmath9 being only a function of colatitude @xmath10 , the analytical field remains divergence - free .    as the field magnitude , and thus the hcs profile , depends solely on @xmath10 , thus varying along a direction perpendicular to the solar wind flow",
    ", there is no compression of the current sheet and thus no driven reconnection .",
    "therefore , the current sheet modeled in this work does not contain additional electric fields beyond the regular motional electric field @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the speed of light . in the case of a wavy hcs ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , especially with greater heliocentric distance , an assumed radial solar wind flow will no longer be wholly in the current sheet plane , requiring more detailed analysis of possible reconnection .",
    "observations estimate the hcs thickness to be in the region of between 5000 and at ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we define the hcs thickness shape function @xmath9 to be a function of colatitude through latitude , as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a configuration parameter with values @xmath15 or @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the thickness of the hcs , and @xmath18 is the _ smootherstep _ function @xcite which maps the parameter range @xmath19 $ ] to the values @xmath19 $ ] as @xmath20 , resulting in a smooth transition with nil first and second - order derivatives at the endpoints .",
    "closer to the sun , this parametrization results in smaller current sheet thicknesses .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 defines the polarity of the dipolar field according to cosmic ray physics standard notation , i.e. a configuration of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) has an outwards - pointing field in the northern hemisphere , and a configuration of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) has an inwards - pointing field in the northern hemisphere , with the direction of the field in the southern hemisphere reversed .",
    "we additionally assess the validity of implementing a hcs with zero thickness , using a shape function @xmath25 , which implements the heaviside step function h as @xmath26    protons propagating within the fields given by equations ( [ eq : sparker])([eq : shapefunctionh ] ) will experience drifts due to the electric field , and the gradients and curvature of the magnetic field .",
    "a full analytical treatise of particle drifts in a parker spiral , far from the hcs , can be found in @xcite , where a better - suited field - aligned frame of reference @xmath27 is introduced . within this system , @xmath28 is directed along the parker spiral magnetic field line , outwards from the sun .",
    "@xmath29 is antiparallel to the standard spherical coordinate vector @xmath30 , and @xmath31 completes the coordinate system .",
    "below , we summarize the non - relativistic forms of the main drifts , the electric field , @xmath32 , and curvature drifts , for the simple case of a unipolar imf ( @xmath33 ) , as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a function of colatitude @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the particle magnetic moment @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the particle mass and charge , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the components of velocity parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "see @xcite for the more general relativistic expressions .",
    "the analytical forms show that for near - equatorial latitudes , the term aligned with @xmath29 dominates both curvature and gradient drifts . for both these drifts ,",
    "when considering the two polarity configurations of the solar dipolar field , we find that for @xmath21 , both hemispheres cause drift of positively charged particles towards the equator , and for @xmath23 , away from it , the patterns well known from gcr studies . thus , for the @xmath21 configuration , the equator is a stable position , and for the @xmath23 configuration , a labile position .",
    "inclusion of the hcs , for example defined through a shape function @xmath8 , will cause additional drifts due to change of magnetic field as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the first drift , valid for both smooth and step - mode current sheet profiles , is the current sheet drift , described commonly as speiser motion @xcite . with @xmath43 approaching zero , the guiding centre approximation of particle motion breaks down .",
    "particles oscillate between the two magnetic field polarities by performing partial gyromotion in each side , then crossing the sheet , and performing gyromotion of opposite chirality on the other side . for particles with positive charge ,",
    "this motion is in a western direction for @xmath21 and an eastern direction for @xmath23 . for a step - mode field transition and an isotropic distrubution , this",
    "was found to lead to an average velocity of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "if the gyroradius of particles is smaller than the characteristic length scale describing the rate of change for @xmath0 due to the shape function @xmath8 , a second drift is found at the current sheet , taking the form of classical gradient drift , and defined as @xmath45 if this drift is present , then @xmath46 would be aligned with @xmath47 , leading to the gradient drift being aligned with @xmath48 .",
    "the direction of this gradient drift would be opposite to that of current sheet drift ( or speiser motion ) .",
    "in our simulations , we investigate sep trajectories in the fixed frame ( spacecraft frame ) in the presence of a flat hcs using a numerical test particle model @xcite with modifications suited to heliospheric problems introduced in @xcite .",
    "instead of using the focused transport equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we solve the full three - dimensional differential equations of motion for each particle . in our model",
    ", drifts are not introduced into the relevant equations analytically , but instead arise naturally from the lorentz and electric force due to the fields given by equations [ eq : sparker][eq : shapefunctionh ] acting on particles during each step of their motion .",
    "we simulate the propagation of energetic protons , injected instantaneously at time @xmath49 from a heliocentric distance of @xmath50 .",
    "protons are injected from a region with angular extent @xmath51 , centered at the heliographic equator . for select studies ,",
    "the injection latitude was varied in order to assess latitudinal drifts .",
    "particles have initial pitch - angles pointing in a random direction within a hemisphere pointing outwards from the sun along the parker spiral .",
    "the relativistic differential equations of particle motion and acceleration are solved using a self - optimizing bulirsch - stoer method @xcite .",
    "particles are propagated in the prescribed magnetic and electric fields , where the motional electric field is solved using a solar wind speed of @xmath52 . in order to model the effects of turbulence and wave - particle effects , particles experience large - angle scattering in the solar wind frame , with poisson - distributed scattering intervals , and a constant rigidity - independent mean free path of , in agreement with an assumed low level of scattering .",
    "we inject @xmath53 particles and trace their propagation within the heliosphere for 100 hours .",
    "snapshots of particle profiles are provided every 60 minutes .",

    "fluence maps were generated with tiles of angular extent @xmath54 over the full length of the simulation , whereas time profile generation used @xmath51 windows and 30 minute time binning .",
    "we chose eight different magnetic field configurations for use in our simulations .",
    "as reference cases , we simulated particle propagation in both inwards- and outwards - pointing unipolar fields ( @xmath55 ) . for heliospheric current sheets we used three different thicknesses , by varying the parameter @xmath17 in equation ( [ eq : shapefunction ] ) .",

    "our first step was to perform qualitative assessment of apparent hcs drifts as a function of sheet thickness . in figure",
    "[ fig : thickness ] we show comparisons between all eight simulated imf configurations .",
    "we plot the distribution of protons injected at after of propagation flattened to the @xmath59 plane ( the equatorial plane of the sun , with the x - axis pointing in the direction of @xmath60 longitude ) .",
    "injection was centered at @xmath61 .",
    "the unipolar cases ( leftmost column ) show that within , little drift has taken place .",
    "the three @xmath21 panels ( top row ) show that the presence of a current sheet generates significant current sheet drift to the right ( west ) , and the three @xmath23 panels ( bottom row ) show current sheet drift to the left ( east ) .",
    "gradient drift associated with the variation of @xmath43 over the thickness of the current sheet is found to be negligible .",
    "we also performed a check to verify that the protons which appear to have drifted are indeed drifting protons , not a projection effect due to the @xmath59 plot .",
    "protons experiencing current sheet drift were confirmed to be located in the vicinity of the hcs .",
    "plots performed for other proton energies show comparable results , with increase in proton energy resulting in greater deviation from the well - connected field lines . at later stages of the simulation ,",
    "up to , the distribution of protons in the inner heliosphere remains characteristically comparable with the case , although corotation causes an transition of all protons , and the general propagation of protons outwards from the sun causes the proton counts close to the sun to decrease .                     in order to assess the magnitude of proton drifts , we gathered all proton crossings across the sphere , saving the time of crossing , the longitude and the latitude of each proton . in figure",

    "we also show a comparative picture where we have removed the effects of corotation ( bottom panel ) .",
    "corotation , also described as the @xmath62 drift , is caused by the field lines along which the particles propagate being frozen into the solar wind plasma .",
    "we also added a longitudinal offset to the bottom panel , so coordinates are shown in relation to the best - connected field line . henceforth , we will utilise these corrections .",
    "the proton distributions in figure [ fig : map_correction ] show that the effect of corotation is significant , which is unsurprising considering the extent of the simulation .",

    "[ fig : maps_grid ] , we plot fluence maps of crossings of protons , injected at , for all eight simulated imf configurations , in the same format as in the lower panel of figure [ fig : map_correction ] .",
    "the latitudinal drifts in the @xmath21 configuration are found to efficiently trap protons close to the current sheet , where they experience current sheet drift . for the @xmath23 configuration , curvature and gradient drifts push protons away from the hcs , but speiser motion nevertheless allows some protons to propagate along the current sheet , until they are ejected and drift away from it .",
    "as our model does not include an intrinsic electric field at the sheet , ejection happens due to particle scattering .",
    "protons experiencing current sheet drift are visible at western heliolongitudes for the @xmath21 configuration ( left column ) and at eastern heliolongitudes for the @xmath23 configuration ( right column ) .",
    "of particular note for the @xmath23 configuration is how , if looking closely at the cells closest to the current sheet at the best - connected field line , intensities are smaller than just above or below it . in figure",

    ", protons are preferentially located at the centre of the current sheet , whereas for the @xmath23 configuration , two peaks further out are seen .",
    "thus , the depletion at the sheet is shown to be real , not caused by current sheet drift spreading a constant amount of protons over a wider range of longitudes .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histograms_grid_long ] , we plot histograms of proton longitudes at the time they cross the sphere boundary , for eight different imf configurations . the current sheet drift is seen to have a significant effect , allowing protons to wrap at least 180 degrees around the sun .",
    "an @xmath21 configuration is seen to have slightly stronger current sheet drift , which is in agreement with the equator being a stable position in @xmath21 , and a labile position in @xmath23 .    in figure",

    "both the maximum amount drifted and the count of protons at each drifting distance are found to increase with energy .",
    "this is as expected , as faster protons are able to sweep across the current sheet from a wider region due to a larger gyroradius , and also due to average speiser motion being linked with energy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 configuration displays a much stronger energy dependence for current sheet drift , as the reach of particle gyromotion plays a critical role in sampling of the magnetic field reversal , due to lateral drifts transporting protons away from the hcs .",
    "the main peak for @xmath23 , however , does spread out , as longitudinal drifts outside the current sheet can also cause protons to spread westward .",
    "the maps and histograms presented in figures [ fig : map_correction ] through [ fig : histograms_long_energies ] do not explicitly display the time profiles of proton crossings at . in order to allow comparisons with real - world observations , we simulated virtual observers at , by collecting proton counts over neighbouring regions of extent on the surface of the sphere .",

    "shows how a single injection event can cause different kinds of observations , depending on virtual observer location , similar to the findings of @xcite . at the best - connected field line ,",
    "the proton flux increases abruptly and then decays exponentially . at eastern longitudes ,",
    "flux is nearly non - existant . with increasing longitudinal separation to the west ,",
    "the onset is delayed and the shape of the profile becomes more gradual .",
    "as flux at western longitudes is influenced by corotation , high energy protons are less numerous , due to propagating rapidly out of the inner heliosphere . at negative heliolatitudes ,",
    "where in our setup all counts are due to drifting effects , we also find an abrupt rise in flux at connected longitudes and slower rises at western longitudes .",
    "however , due to latitudinal drifts being energy - dependent , these time profiles emphasise high energy protons . thus ,",
    "if the proton flux of a solar event at an observer is strongly influenced by latitudinal drifts , the observed spectrum can appear much harder than that of the source population .",
    "we also note that separation between the observer and the well - connected field line increases the onset time difference between different energies .    with the @xmath23 imf configuration , shown in figure [ fig : timeprofile_a- ] ,",
    "we see a case very similar to the unipolar one , with rapid or prolonged rise phases of intensity , depending on longitude . for this case , however , intensities extend to both positive and negative heliolatitudes . again",
    ", the process of latitudinal proton drifts causes apparent hardening of observed proton spectra north and south of the injection region .",
    "we also note that a relatively small abrupt component is seen at the equator , at eastern longitudes , due to protons experiencing current sheet drift . due to the combined effect of current sheet drift and latitudinal drifts , high energy protons are much less abundant at western longitudes than for the unipolar case .    with the @xmath21 imf configuration , shown in figure [ fig : timeprofile_a+ ] , we find that the gradient and curvature drifts prevent any significant proton flux from extending to positive or negative heliolatitudes . protons at lower energies display the same longitudinal characteristic of more prolonged event rise with increasing longitude .",
    "of particular interest is the abrupt current sheet drift associated component at early phases of the simulation , as can be seen by comparing figure [ fig : timeprofile_a+ ] with figure [ fig : timeprofile_unipolar ] .",
    "this additional component is found at western observers , causing the time profiles to exhibit two distinct components .",
    "thus , a single injection event could , with a suitable imf configuration , be observed as two particle events .",
    "comparisons of different hcs thickness parameters did not result in noticeable variation in the characteristics of proton time profiles .",
    "the additional plots have thus been omitted .    in figure",

    "the imf configuration was confirmed to significantly affect the qualitative shape of time profiles at different observer locations . for an injection location centered at the hcs , the @xmath21 configuration confined protons to the vicinity of the hcs , whereas the @xmath23 configuration caused observers at both northern and southern latitudes to observe particle fluxes .",
    "latitudes separated from the injection region exhibited harder power - laws in particle flux compared with latitudes with injection , due to energy dependence of drifts .",
    "the current sheet drift of protons was detectable for an observer at the solar equator , causing an additional abrupt peak early in the event at eastern longitudes for the @xmath23 configuration and western longitudes for the @xmath21 configuration . in the @xmath21 case , this generated dual - component time profiles , which could be misinterpreted as being accelerated by two distinct events .",
    "we find that the imf configuration can affect the extent of deceleration experienced by seps , with high energy particles in an @xmath21 configuration retaining a significant portion of their energy due to constraints upon latitudinal drifting extents .",
    "when propagating within an @xmath23 imf configuration , latitudinal drifts are not constrained as they are towards the poles , and particles experience deceleration in agreement with the unipolar case . as",
    "drift effects are dependent on particle energy , deceleration plays an important role in all of our other results as well .",
    "protons detected at with a given energy will have been injected at sometimes significantly higher energies , and thus , will have been able to drift greater distances during their interplanetary propagation .    finally , we assess the motion of particles across a flat hcs , and find that only scattering allows for protons to cross into the opposite hemisphere .",
    "the amount of scattering across the hcs is found to be small .",
    "thus , within our model , if a current sheet exists between and injection site and an observer , fluences can be strongly suppressed .",
    "we note that all presented results involve a relatively small injection region , perhaps associated best with a flare without an associated cme . for injection at wider fronts ,",
    "a tile - based approach like the one presented in @xcite can be applied .",
    "the configuration of the hcs and its associated drifts have thus been show to play an important role in the longitudinal and latitudinal transport of seps , the generation of complex time profiles , hardened proton spectra , and also the absence of flux at field lines close to the best - connected one .",
    "the presented results are applicable to eruptions during the solar minimum , when the solar magnetic field resembles a dipole . to model active phases of the sun , when the hcs is tilted and wavy , resulting in a more complex imf , additional investigations are required , and these will be the subject of future work .",
