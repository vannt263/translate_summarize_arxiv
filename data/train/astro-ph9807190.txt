    "40004000  = 1000            recent supernova ia observations have generated a lot of interest in cosmological models where a significant fraction of the energy contents has negative pressure ( ) .",
    "a common way of parameterizing the equation of state of this component , which we call @xmath9 , is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the pressure and density respectively .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath3 corresponds to the case @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to have independent ways to constrain the abundance and properties of such a component , as different methods suffer from different systematic errors , and , perhaps more importantly , different methods are sensitive to different combinations of parameters . in this paper , we discuss a version of a test proposed by alcock & paczyski (; ap hereafter ) , which is particularly sensitive to the presence / absence of @xmath9 .",
    "they observed that an object placed at a cosmological distance would have a definite relationship between its angular and redshift extents , which is cosmology - dependent .",
    "consider an object with mean redshift @xmath14 , and angular size @xmath15 which thus has transverse extent ( in velocity units ) @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath14 , and @xmath18 is the angular diameter distance . for spherical objects the radial and transverse extents are equal , but more generally if the object is squashed radially by a factor @xmath19 , then the radial extent is @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the speed of light and @xmath22 is assumed . a plot of @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ angqk ] .",
    "note how its value for a @xmath9-dominated universe ( for @xmath24 ) differs significantly from that for a no-@xmath9-universe .",
    "various incarnations of this test have been discussed in the context of galaxy and quasar surveys ( e.g. ) where the `` object '' used is the two - point correlation function , whose `` shape''(@xmath19 above ) need not be spherical because of redshift - anisotropy induced by peculiar motion . in the case of the lyman - alpha ( ly@xmath0 ) forest , we can not observe the full three - dimensional ( 3d ) correlation directly .",
    "instead we can measure the one - dimensional ( 1d ) correlation along a line of sight ( los ) , and the cross - correlation between two ( or multiple ) close - by los , or their fourier counterparts : the auto- and the cross - spectra .",
    "the two are related to each other through an underlying 3d power spectrum .",
    "these relations are spelled out in  [ general ] ( for auto - spectrum , see also ) . using a method developed by hui @xcite building on earlier work by croft et al .",
    "@xcite , one can invert the auto - spectrum to obtain the underlying 3d power spectrum , which then allows one to predict what the cross - spectrum should be , except that the prediction is cosmology - dependent .",
    "a comparison between the observed and the predicted cross - spectrum is then our version of the ap test .",
    "it is not the only version possible in the context of the forest , but we will use this version to gain some intuition on the sensitivity of the ap test to various cosmological parameters . a hypothetical implementation of this test is studied in  [ ap ] .",
    "an important problem in this application of the ap test is the modeling of the redshift - space distortions ( the `` shape '' ) .",
    "we give a first estimate using linear theory in  [ perturbac ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ conclude ] with an assessment of the expected s / n of the ap - effect - measurement in the ly@xmath0 forest , and remarks on lines of further investigation .      given the observed transmission @xmath25 as a function of the velocity @xmath26 along a los and the angular position @xmath15 on the sky , let us define @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean transmission .",
    "then the auto - correlation @xmath29 along the los and the cross - correlation @xmath30 between two close - by los of angular separation @xmath15 , and their fourier counterparts the auto - spectrum @xmath31 and the cross - spectrum @xmath32 , are respectively defined by @xmath33 where we use @xmath34 to denote the wave - vector along the line of sight .",
    "the two quantities are related to an underlying 3d power spectrum @xmath35 , where we use @xmath36 to denote the 3d nature , and @xmath37 is the length of the 3d wave - vector : @xmath38   k { dk \\over   2 \\pi } \\\\ \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 = \\int_0^{2\\pi } e^{-i x \\ , { \\rm cos}\\ , \\alpha } d\\alpha/(2\\pi)$ ] is the zeroth order bessel function , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the transverse velocity - separation for the given @xmath15 ( eq . [",
    "[ uperp ] ] ) .",
    "we deliberately allow @xmath35 two arguments to account for the possibility of an anisotropic 3d power spectrum , as for instance in the presence of distortions by peculiar motion , or thermal broadening ( bear in mind that line - broadening always acts along , not transverse , to the los ) .",
    "the tricky part is how to model this distortion .",
    "a general form is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a distortion kernel , and @xmath44 with only one argument represents the transmission power spectrum in the absence of peculiar motion and line - broadening .    as we will discuss in  [ perturbac ] ,",
    "( [ w ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ pthreed ] ) allow us to predict the cross - spectrum , once the auto - spectrum is given and @xmath43 as well as the relevant cosmological parameters determining the angle - velocity relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ uperp ] ] ) are specified .",
    "a comparison of the predicted and observed cross - spectra then allows one to discriminate between different cosmological models , which is our version of the ap test .",
    "we will perform a first estimate of @xmath43 using perturbation theory .",
    "a linear perturbative calculation ( i.e. assume @xmath45 ) of the auto - spectrum has been carried out in hui @xcite .",
    "the cross - spectrum can be computed in a very similar manner .",
    "we simply state the results here , and refer the reader to hui @xcite for details .    essentially , both power spectra follow from the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ papc ] ) , with @xmath43 given by with the @xmath46 $ ] in hui @xcite , where @xmath47 is a constant , @xmath48 is roughly the jean scale , and @xmath49 is the 3d real - space mass power spectrum . ]",

    "( see hui for details ) .      as shown in hui @xcite , this allows a one - parameter - only ( @xmath62 ) inversion of the large scale 3d isotropic power spectrum @xmath44 using this linear integral equation , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ pthreed ] ) and ( [ w ] ) : @xmath64 the above , in discretized form , can be viewed as a matrix equation , and one simply inverts a matrix proportional to @xmath43 ( which is in essence upper or lower triangular because of the limits of integration / summation ) to obtain @xmath65 from the auto - spectrum .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath66 ( eq . [ [ wlinear ] ] ) could be used instead of the full @xmath43 in obtaining the large scale @xmath67 , with good accuracy .",
    "the reader is referred to hui @xcite for illustrations of this method .",
    "an interesting bonus of the distortion kernel given in eq .",
    "( [ wperturb ] ) is that the factor of @xmath68 $ ] is commonly used to describe nonlinear redshift distortions of galaxy distributions ( see e.g. ) .",
    "this should come as no surprise because nonlinear distortions arise from virialized objects which have a maxwellian distribution of velocities  precisely the form for thermal broadening as well , which determines @xmath60 .",
    "one can then use the perturbative kernel in eq .",
    "( [ wperturb ] ) but allow @xmath60 to vary to account for nonlinear distortions .",
    "we will not pursue that here , but will come back to it in  [ conclude ] . it should be emphasized that even if @xmath43 turns out to be substantially different from eq .",
    "( [ wperturb ] ) or ( [ wlinear ] ) , perhaps due to nonlinear clustering , the procedure of inverting a triangular matrix using eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) should generally work .",
    "given the 3d isotropic power spectrum @xmath44 , one can predict the cross - spectrum using : @xmath69 { k dk \\over { 2 \\pi } }   \\label{projectionc}\\ ] ] which follows from eq .",
    "( [ pthreed ] ) and ( [ w ] ) . as in the inversion procedure above , we will use @xmath66 instead of the full @xmath43 , when performing the above integration .",
    "we will see in the next section that the induced error in the predicted large scale cross - spectrum is small .",
    "note that the rapid oscillation of @xmath70 and decay of @xmath71 at high @xmath72 or @xmath37 means the large scale @xmath32 is not sensitive to assumptions made about the small scale distortion kernel .",
    "the ap test for the ly@xmath0 forest could be implemented in several different ways .",
    "the version adopted here should be seen as a first step towards understanding the sensitivity of the test .",
    "we will discuss the issue of other possible implementations in  [ conclude ] .",
    "suppose one is given a set of idealized observed transmission power spectra , say the auto - spectrum and the cross - spectra for two different angular separations @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in real life , one of course does not know _ a priori _ the underlying cosmological model behind this set of observations .",
    "for the sake of our testing here , let us construct these power spectra by assuming an input `` true '' model : the open cold - dark - matter ( ocdm ) universe with @xmath6 and no @xmath9 .",
    "the full distortion kernel ( eq . [",
    "[ wperturb ] ] ) is used to compute these power spectra , with @xmath75 , and @xmath55 , @xmath60 and @xmath48 corresponding to a gas of temperature @xmath76 ( see hui for details ) .",
    "the mass power spectrum is assumed to have a shape parameter of @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 .",
    "pretending we have no insider information on the underlying cosmology , our version of the ap test comes in two steps .",
    "first , perform the inversion from the `` observed '' auto - spectrum @xmath79 to the 3d isotropic power spectrum @xmath44 using eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) and @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ wlinear ] ) . by using the latter instead of the full kernel as in eq .",
    "( [ wperturb ] ) , we will be making an error .",
    "however , the error will be small on sufficiently large scales , as we will see .",
    "the second step involves predicting the cross - spectra for the corresponding angular separations , using eq .",
    "( [ projectionc ] ) , once the 3d isotropic power spectrum @xmath44 is computed .",
    "both steps require the assumption of a cosmological model . in the first step ,",
    "the cosmological density parameters determine the amount of redshift - space anisotropy that needs to be accounted for , through the parameter @xmath62 or @xmath80 ( eq . [ [ wlinear ] ] or [ [ betadelta ] ] ) .",
    "the temperature - density - relation index @xmath57 also enters into @xmath62 ; we will come back to this below . in the second step",
    ", cosmology dictates the angle - velocity relation through the quantity @xmath81 ( eq . [ [ uperp ] ] & [ [ projectionc ] ] ) .    to parameterize the cosmological model that we need to assume in carrying out the ap test , we use @xmath2 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which correspond to the mass , curvature and @xmath9 density parameters .",
    "they sum to 1 .",
    "the @xmath9 component is described by an equation of state of the form @xmath10 where @xmath84 .",
    "the limiting cases of @xmath85 and @xmath86 correspond to the cosmological constant @xmath3 and matter @xmath87 respectively . for @xmath88 , the @xmath9 component could cluster ( e.g. ) , which would affect the distortion parameter @xmath62 .",
    "we consider the simple case of no @xmath9-clustering here ( see e.g. ) .    assuming any set of parameters different from that of the underlying input model ( ocdm ) will result in predicted cross - spectra different from the `` observed '' ones .",
    "the fractional errors , for a set of 5 cosmological models , are shown in fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] .",
    "in the case where the actual input cosmology is used , the cross - spectra are quite accurately predicted .",
    "it is not perfect , especially at smaller scales , because the inversion procedure in the first step of our version of the ap test is inherently approximate by avoiding the modeling of small scale distortions ( see ) .",
    "however , in cases where the `` wrong '' model - cosmology is assumed , the predicted cross - spectra are systematically different from the `` observed '' or input cross - spectra .",
    "the effect is most pronounced when @xmath9 is present .",
    "the canonical example is the cosmological constant with @xmath13 , which gives the strongest departure , among the five models , of the predicted cross - spectra from those of the input cosmology , with differences as large as @xmath89 at sufficiently large @xmath34 s . increasing @xmath90 while keeping @xmath83 fixed ( the @xmath91 model ) , or decreasing @xmath83 while keeping @xmath90 fixed ( adding in mixture of curvature , as in the somewhat perverse model of @xmath92 , @xmath93 & @xmath94 ) tends to bring the predictions closer to that of the input open universe , but still with substantial differences .",
    "the @xmath95 critical matter density universe is closest to the input model ( that is , aside from the input model itself ) , with a difference of about @xmath96 .    as we discuss before , the cosmological model influences the prediction of the cross - spectra through two parameters : @xmath80 ( or @xmath62 ; see eq . [ [ betadelta ] ] ) of the distortion kernel , and @xmath81 ( eq . [ [ uperp ] ] ) of the velocity - distance relation . to understand approximately the size of the effect we are measuring , it is simplest to ignore redshift - distortion first , and consider the influence of the second parameter alone .",
    "putting @xmath97 and assuming a power - law @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ projectionc ] ) , it can be shown that ( ) @xmath99^{1 + { n\\over 2 } } \\ , k_{1+{n\\over 2 } } ( k_\\parallel u_\\perp ) \\ , / \\ , \\gamma ( -n/2 ) \\label{pcrossanalytic}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the @xmath101-th order modified bessel function and @xmath102 is the gamma function .",
    "@xmath103 has an asymptote of @xmath104 $ ] in the large-@xmath105 limit .",
    "( for @xmath106 this is exact . ) for the scales of interest , @xmath107 should vary somewhere between @xmath108 and @xmath109 . for sufficiently large @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath110 ) , the @xmath41 and @xmath34 dependence of the cross - spectrum is given by : for @xmath111 , @xmath112 / \\sqrt{k_\\parallel u_\\perp}$ ] , while for @xmath113 , @xmath114 / k_\\parallel$ ] .",
    "this exponential dependence on @xmath81 explains the large differences between different models at the smaller scales .",
    "( of course , the exponential suppression of power at high @xmath34 s also means the cross - spectrum is going to be hard to measure at such scales .",
    "see  [ conclude ] . )",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ angqk ] two curves depicting how @xmath115 varies with @xmath90 and with @xmath82 .",
    "it can be seen that pure matter - plus - curvature models ( with no @xmath9 ) generally have a higher @xmath116 than @xmath9-dominated models .",
    "combining such information with fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] , we can say that the cross - spectra of models with a significant @xmath9 component are generally @xmath117 higher , or more , than those of no-@xmath9-models , at @xmath110 . this can be understood using our analytic formula in eq .",
    "( [ pcrossanalytic ] ) , assuming @xmath118 to @xmath109 .    put in another way , given an observed auto - spectrum ,",
    "the inferred correlation length in physical distance scale is larger in a universe dominated by @xmath9 compared to a no-@xmath9-universe ; ignoring redshift - space distortions , this implies a larger cross - correlation length , and manifests itself in a stronger cross - correlation for the @xmath9-dominated model .",
    "that is what we see in fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] .",
    "a good illustration of redshift - space anisotropy can be seen by a comparison of the @xmath95 model and the open model with @xmath6 & @xmath119 . according to the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ angqk ] , the two have very similar @xmath41 s with the latter s a little smaller .",
    "this means , with no redshift distortions , the latter should have a cross - spectrum close to , but above , that of the @xmath95 model .",
    "exactly the opposite is observed in fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] .",
    "this is because peculiar motion induces a stronger anisotropy of the correlation function in the @xmath120 model , in the sense of a greater squashing of the correlation length along the los ( see eq . [ [ wlinear ] ] ) .",
    "the end - result is a stronger cross - correlation of the critical - matter - density model over the open model .",
    "the effect is not large .",
    "it shifts the cross - spectrum of the @xmath95 model relative to that of the @xmath6 - @xmath119 model by about @xmath121 .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for most other models in that redshift - space distortions change their fractional differences by about @xmath122 . for reference , the values of @xmath80 ( eq . [ [ betadelta ] ] ) for the 5 models in fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] are @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath124 from top to bottom .",
    "it can also be seen from our hypothetical ap test that besides constraining the absence or presence of @xmath83 , the predicted cross - spectra can also be used to discriminate between different equations of state in cases where @xmath83 is known . unfortunately , according to fig .",
    "[ angqk ] , the quantity @xmath127 takes rather similar values for @xmath128 , which are also values that seem to be allowed by current supernova observations ( ) . the test does have good discriminating power among models with larger @xmath90 s , however .",
    "the distortion parameter @xmath62 depends on , in addition to the various @xmath129 s , the temperature - density - relation index @xmath57 ( eq.[[betadelta ] ] ) , which while not known precisely , has been shown by hui & gnedin @xcite to generally lie in the range @xmath130 .",
    "varying @xmath57 within this range changes the cross - spectra by @xmath131 .      at this point ,",
    "a natural question to ask is : how well can we measure the cross - spectrum ? and given the expected signal - to - noise of such a measurement , what is the expected discriminating power among different cosmologies ?",
    "the expected variance in the measured cross - spectrum for a single @xmath34-mode is approximately given by @xmath132 ( see ) .",
    "this is obtained by ignoring shot - noise , which is likely to be accurate because the poisson - variance is known to be sub - dominant compared to sample - variance ( at least for the brighter quasars , see e.g. ) , and assuming gaussianity , which is probably a good approximation by the central - limit - theorem , especially on large scales ( ) . since @xmath133 in general , we can approximate the signal - to - noise for each wave - mode of the measured cross - spectrum by @xmath134 .",
    "on the other hand , our calculation in the last section tells us what @xmath135 ( fig . [ pinvc7 ] ) is between any pair of cosmological models .",
    "let us denote these two models by @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "as argued in  [ ap ] , the dominant contribution to the difference in @xmath32 s can be estimated by ignoring redshift - space distortions . in that case",
    ", the difference in the cross - spectra is due entirely to the difference in the transverse velocity - separations ( eq . [ [ uperp ] ] ) , let us call them @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively . assuming @xmath140 , eq .",
    "( [ pcrossanalytic ] ) & ( [ projection ] ) allows us to compute both @xmath141 and @xmath134 , from which we can deduce the following : one can rule out model @xmath137 , if @xmath136 is the true model , with a @xmath142-level or signal - to - noise ( @xmath143 ) of @xmath144 - 1\\right]^2 { \\rm exp}[-2k_\\parallel u_\\perp^a ] } \\label{sn}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all @xmath34 modes for which the ap test can be applied . from fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] , we will take @xmath145 , where the lower limit is set by the scale at which the slowly - fluctuating continuum would contaminate the signal , and the upper limit is set by the scale at which nonlinear distortions would start to become important ( see ) .",
    "one can replace the summation by an integration : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the length of the absorption spectrum available .",
    "assuming full coverage between ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "hence , taking model @xmath136 to be the @xmath6 - @xmath119 universe and model @xmath137 to be the @xmath6 - @xmath150 universe , we find that , at @xmath78 , the expected @xmath143 is @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively for angular separations of @xmath153 and @xmath74 .",
    "it turns out @xmath143 peaks at about @xmath154 , reaching @xmath155 , but drops off at smaller @xmath15 s .",
    "( the @xmath143 estimate above should be modified for sufficiently small @xmath15 s because @xmath156 no longer holds . also , it changes somewhat with @xmath157 , @xmath107 and the @xmath34 s we include , but it provides a good rough estimate for a reasonable range of parameters . ) there are two competing effects : a larger @xmath15 gives a larger difference between models ( fig .",
    "[ pinvc7 ] ) , but also a smaller @xmath32 , hence harder to measure .",
    "note that this is for only one pair of quasar spectra . to reach a @xmath8 level discrimination , something like @xmath4 pairs , at angular separations @xmath5 , would be required .",
    "note also that in the above estimate , we have ignored the error in the prediction of the cross - spectrum from the observed auto - spectrum .",
    "this error is likely to be sub - dominant , particularly because a very large number of los is in principle available for measuring the auto - spectrum .",
    "there are roughly @xmath158 pairs of quasars with existing spectra at the above angular separations , or slightly larger , for @xmath159 ( see e.g. & ref . therein ) .",
    "upcoming surveys such as the aat 2df and sdss are expected to increase this number by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "some of these will be faint quasars for which shot - noise might be important .",
    "a few issues should be further explored in the application of the ap test .",
    "first , it is obvious from the above analysis that we could boost the @xmath143 for the smaller angular separations by extending to higher @xmath34 s .",
    "this requires , however , the modeling of nonlinear redshift distortions .",
    "the finger - of - god on small scales would lower our predicted cross - spectrum .",
    "the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ wperturb ] ) could be used for modeling this ( e.g. ) , but it probably depends on more than simply the @xmath129 s we are interested in . moreover , our large - scale linear distortion kernel ( eq . [ [ wlinear ] ] ) should be checked against simulations for accuracy .",
    "it is known in the case of galaxy - surveys , for instance , that the linear prediction for redshift distortions could be modified even on very large scales .",
    "furthermore , the effective bias factor in the distortion kernel ( @xmath160 in @xmath62 ; eq . [ [ betadelta ] ] ) might also deviate from the linear prediction ( ) .",
    "second , we have focused on a particular version of the ap test here , in which we construct a predicted cross - spectrum based on the observed auto - spectrum . in practice , one should test the whole inversion procedure from the auto - spectrum to the cross - spectrum with simulated noisy data , to guard against possible instabilities .",
    "an alternative would be , for instance , to parameterize @xmath44 ( eq .",
    "[ [ projection ] ] & [ [ projectionc ] ] ) by an amplitude and a slope , and then fit simultaneously these parameters and the various @xmath129 s to match the observed auto- and cross - spectra .",
    "this could lead to smaller error - bars for the measured @xmath129 s by restricting the form of @xmath44 .",
    "lastly , we have chosen to focus on a subset of cosmological parameters which are deemed to be currently popular ( fig .",
    "[ angqk ] ) . however , there exist cosmological models which are less conventional , but nonetheless not necessarily ruled out by current observations , such as a universe closed by a large @xmath83 ( e.g. ) .",
    "such models could predict a cross - spectrum so strong that even one pair of quasar spectra would be sufficient to rule them out , that is , if they do not describe the actual universe . we will pursue this and other observational issues in a separate paper ."
