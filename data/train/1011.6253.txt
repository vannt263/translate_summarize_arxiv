    "recent large databases of absolute proper motions and radial velocities offer an entirely new perspective on the 3d kinematical structure of the milky way , as they probe large volumes unavailable in previous studies .",
    "such recent studies are primarily based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) and its sub - survey sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue , yanny et al .",
    "for instance , carollo et al . ( 2010 , c10 ) , bond et al . ( 2010 , b10 ) , smith et al . (",
    "2009 ) have characterized in detail the inner and outer halo , and the disk ( thin , thick and metal weak ) .",
    "proper motions in these studies are derived using positions from the usno - b catalog ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) and sdss ( munn et al . 2004 , 2008 ) , or from sdss - only data ( bramich et al . 2008 ) .",
    "another significant effort in this direction is the combination of the radial velocity experiment ( rave , e.g. for data release 2 , zwitter et al .",
    "2008 ) with other proper - motion catalogs ( e.g. , ucac2 - zacharias et al . 2000 , tycho2 - perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , as exemplified in studies by siebert et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , veltz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    in this work",
    "we combine radial velocities from rave dr2 with absolute proper motions from the fourth release of the southern proper motion catalog ( spm4 , girard et al .",
    "2010 ) , to provide an accurate 3d kinematical description of the thick disk .",
    "it is particularly desirable to have such a description in order to help discriminate among competing models for the formation of this component .    the work by sales et al .",
    "( 2009 ) shows that the orbital eccentricity distribution is a good discriminator between various scenarios such as ; accretion of many satellites , radial migration , dynamical heating from a satellite , and gas - rich merging with satellites and in - situ star formation .",
    "two recent papers based on rave ( wilson et al . 2010 ) and sdss data ( dierickx et al . 2010 ) use the observed eccentricity distribution to favor the gas - rich merging scenario .",
    "however the sdss - based study by loebman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argues in favor of radial migration , primarily based on the lack of correlation between rotation velocity and metallicity .",
    "thus , a number of issues remain to be explored both on the modeling and observational side for a realistic description of the formation of the thick disk .    also , the recent study by bond et al .",
    "( 2010 ) determines much lower velocity dispersions of the thick disk than traditionally measured ( e.g. , soubiran et al .",
    "2003 , chiba & beers 2000 ) , raising yet again the question of a clear distinction between the thin and thick disks . with these issues in mind",
    ", we hope this contribution will help improve the current understanding of the thick disk .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath0 red clump stars primarily selected using 2mass photometry ( skrutskie et al .",
    "it is a clean sample of well - behaved tracers for which both sources of radial velocities and proper motions are well understood in terms of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the sample includes stars between 0.4 and 4 kpc from the sun , which corresponds to a distance between 5 and 10 kpc from the gc , and up to 3 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "this sample is used to determine various kinematical parameters of the thick disk , a dynamical estimate of the thin - disk scale length to be compared with star - count determinations and the eccentricity distribution of stars in the thick disk .",
    "our results are then discussed in the framework of current thick - disk formation models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the sample selection and its properties , in section 3 we show the spatial distribution of the sample and the calculation of velocities .",
    "section 4 discusses the lsr velocity , while section 5 details the velocity and velocity dispersion gradients . in section 6",
    ", we determine the tilt angles of the velocity ellipsoid , and in section 7 we determine the scale length of the thin disk .",
    "the comparison of the eccentricity distributions is presented in section 8 . in section 9",
    ", we summarize our results .",
    "the rave dr2 dataset has 49327 individual objects , of which 21121 also have stellar parameters such as surface gravity , effective temperature and metallicity measured .",
    "typical uncertainties for surface gravity , effective temperature and metallicity are 0.5 dex , 400 k and 0.2 dex respectively ( zwitter et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the spm4 catalog contains positions and absolute proper motions for @xmath9 million objects down to @xmath10 .",
    "absolute proper motions are tied to the icrs via @xmath11 stars at the bright end , and to galaxies at the faint end .",
    "the catalog also provides @xmath12 photometry from various sources including ccd photometry from the second - epoch spm data and 2mass @xmath13 photometry .",
    "individual proper - motion uncertainties vary with magnitude ; well measured stars ( @xmath14 ) have uncertainties of @xmath15 mas  yr@xmath2 . according to girard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) the proper - motion error estimates in spm4 are reliable , based on a comparison with the more precise spm2 catalog ( platais et al .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute proper - motion system is expected to be of the order of @xmath15 mas  yr@xmath2 ( girard et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we match the spm4 catalog with the entire rave dr2 dataset , to obtain 31994 unique objects .",
    "the match is done by positional coincidence with a maximum matching radius of @xmath16 . for multiple",
    "matching , we choose the object with the smallest separation . in figure 1 , we show the distribution of rave and spm4 data in equatorial ( top ) , and galactic ( bottom ) coordinates .    for each object , we determine the reddening @xmath17 from the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) maps and eliminate from further analysis objects with @xmath18 .",
    "objects are dereddened using the relationships from majewski et al .",
    "we will focus on the analysis of red clump stars , which are metal - rich stars in the he - burning core phase with well defined absolute magnitudes , and thus distances .",
    "the absolute magnitude of red clump stars is @xmath19 with a dispersion of 0.22 mag ( alves 2000 ) , and it varies little with metallicity [ fe / h ] if the metallicity range is between -0.5 and 0.1 ( grocholski & sarajedini 2002 ) . in figure 2 we show the @xmath20 hr diagram for @xmath11 stars that have 2mass photometry .",
    "these stars are south of dec @xmath21 as in the spm4 area coverage , and at galactic latitudes @xmath22 , to avoid large corrections for reddening .",
    "their parallax errors are @xmath23 , and the parallax data are from the reduction by van leeuwen ( 2007 ) .",
    "the red clump stars are easily discernible at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "this color cut has been extensively used in studies of the thin and thick - disk parameters inferred from density laws ( e.g. , cabrera - lavers et al . 2005 , 2007 , veltz et al .",
    "2008 ) , as well as more recent kinematical studies such as the estimation of the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid ( siebert et al .",
    "2008 ) .    from fig .",
    "2 , stars that contaminate this region are k dwarfs and subgiants .",
    "since k dwarfs are some 6 magnitudes fainter than red clump stars , they can be readily identified as objects with very large velocities .",
    "k dwarfs have large proper motions as nearby stars , and wrongly adopted large distances , thus their velocities appear unusually large . of more concern",
    "however are the subgiants that reside in the same color range as red clump stars . to better understand their contribution in our sample , we inspect the surface gravities log  @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 colors , for the subsample that has stellar parameters determined .",
    "we show this plot in figure 3 .",
    "red clump stars have surface gravities log  @xmath28 to 3 ( puzeras et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) , and a color cut @xmath29 clearly includes these stars , as well as a significant portion of subgiants and dwarf stars . to minimize the contribution of subgiants",
    ", we thus restrict the color cut to @xmath30 , which helps exclude many of the stars with log  @xmath26 = 3 to 4 .",
    "next we inspect the total velocity in relation to log  @xmath26 , to further eliminate dwarfs .",
    "velocities are determined from radial velocities , absolute proper motions and distances , where the distance is derived from the absolute magnitude @xmath31 of red clump stars and the dereddened @xmath32 magnitude ( see also next section ) . in figure 4",
    "we show the total velocity as a function of log  @xmath26 for the @xmath29 sample ( top ) , and for the @xmath30 ( bottom ) .",
    "objects with apparently large motions ( @xmath33 km  s@xmath2 ) are clearly present at log  @xmath34 representing nearby dwarfs with wrongly assigned distances . in the color range @xmath29 , for log  @xmath35",
    "to 3 , there appear to be a significant number of objects with relatively high velocities ( @xmath36 km s@xmath2 ) , compared to those with log  @xmath37 : these are most likely subgiants contaminating the sample , that similarly to the dwarfs have been assigned too large distances .",
    "in the color range @xmath30 , the population of likely subgiants appears much diminished . for these reasons , in our subsequent analysis , we use red clump stars selected in the color range @xmath30 .",
    "we further eliminate all stars with @xmath38 km s@xmath2 , as likely nearby stars with wrongly assigned distances . with these cuts ,",
    "the sample has 4815 objects , of which @xmath39 have log  @xmath26 determinations .",
    "we further impose one more restriction , i.e. , for objects with log  @xmath26 determinations , we keep only those that have log  @xmath40 , amounting to a sample of 4420 stars to be analyzed ( the fraction of objects with stellar parameters is now @xmath41 ) .",
    "next , we estimate the dwarf and subgiant contamination remaining in our entire sample .",
    "for the dwarfs this is done by determining the fraction of stars that have log  @xmath26 = [ 4,5 ] and @xmath38 km s@xmath2 in the sample with log  @xmath26 determinations .",
    "we proceed similarly for the subgiants , selecting this time stars with log  @xmath26 = ( 3,4 ) .",
    "these fractions are then scaled to the entire sample , and taking into account that @xmath39 of the stars were already trimmed such that log  @xmath40 .",
    "we obtain that the dwarf contribution to our sample of 4420 stars is @xmath42 , while that of subgiants is @xmath43 .",
    "these contamination estimates do not consider uncertainties in log  @xmath26 .    in figure 5",
    "we show the @xmath44 and @xmath45 magnitude distributions of our entire sample ( 4420 stars ) , and the metallicity distribution , for the subsample with stellar parameter determinations ( 1780 stars ) .",
    "the double peaked shape of the magnitude distribution is due to the input selection of rave stars ( e.g. , fig 1 in zwitter et al . 2008 ) , and it will have bearing on the contribution of thin disk stars .",
    "the metallicity distribution is indeed peaked toward high values , ensuring that the absolute magnitude @xmath31 used for red clump stars is appropriate .",
    "our sample will therefore explore the kinematics of thin and thick disk red clump stars , and due to the color selection will have no bearing on the metal weak thick disk ( e.g. , morrison et al .",
    "1990 ) due to the color selection .",
    "in figure 6 we show the distribution of photometrically - determined distances from the sun ; the shape of the distribution is determined by the input selection of rave stars ( see also fig . 5 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sample is shown in figure 7 , where @xmath46 are cartesian coordinates , with the sun located at ( 8 , 0 , 0 ) kpc .",
    "@xmath47 is positive toward galactic rotation , and @xmath48 toward the north galactic pole .",
    "we also define @xmath49 , as the distance from the gc , projected in the galactic plane .",
    "various panels show different projections .",
    "the higher concentration of points near the sun s location reflects once again the magnitude selection of the input list of rave stars , and is not a spatial substructure .",
    "the bottom panels show the @xmath50 distribution of the sample split into stars above and below the galactic plane .",
    "stars above the plane mainly occupy quadrant four , while stars below the plane occupy quadrant four and partly quadrants one and three .",
    "we note that the galactic bar has its near end in quadrant one , with the corotation radius between @xmath51 kpc and its orientation at @xmath52 from the gc - sun direction ( gerhard 2010 and references therein ) .    among the known inner - halo / thick - disk substructures that might affect our sample",
    "is the overdensity found in the first quadrant ( @xmath53 ) by larsen & humphreys ( 1996 ) and further characterized by parker et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) , larsen et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "this overdensity is located between 1 to 2.5 kpc from the sun , above and below the plane ; however it does not extend into quadrant four .",
    "the galactic latitude extent is from @xmath54 .",
    "our sample avoids regions at @xmath55 due to the rave input list ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and because we discard regions of high extinction .",
    "thus , our sample may be slightly affected by this overdensity below the plane in quadrant one .",
    "the galactic stellar warp is known to have a starting galactocentric radius of @xmath56 kpc ( e.g. lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2002 ) . a recent model of the stellar warp by reyl et al .",
    "( 2009 ) indicates that the elevation of the disk midplane due to the warp is about 200 pc at a galactocentric radius of 10 kpc , which is the largest galactocentric radius encompassed by our sample . at this radius",
    "however , our sample includes stars more than 1 kpc from the plane ( fig .",
    "7 ) , so we do not believe that the kinematics of our sample is affected by the warp .",
    "we calculate velocities in a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 is positive outward from the gc , @xmath59 is positive in the galactic rotation direction , and @xmath60 is positive toward the north galactic pole .",
    "the velocities are in a galactic rest frame , after the rotation of the lsr , @xmath61 km  s@xmath2 and the solar peculiar motion ( @xmath62 km  s@xmath2 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) have been subtracted .",
    "velocities are derived from proper motions , radial velocities and distances .",
    "errors in velocities are propagated from the errors in the proper motions , radial velocities and distances .",
    "proper - motion errors for the magnitude range explored here range between 0.4 and 4 mas  yr@xmath2 , with an average of 1.3 mas  yr@xmath2 ( girard et al .",
    "radial - velocity errors are between 0.3 and 4 km  s@xmath2 , with an average of 1.7 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "distance errors are determined from the error in the @xmath45 magnitude and the intrinsic scatter of 0.22 mags in the absolute magnitude of red clump stars .",
    "it is this latter number that dominates the error budget , amounting to about @xmath63 in distance .",
    "we have confirmed the propagated errors with errors derived via monte carlo simulations drawn from errors in proper motions , radial velocities and distances .",
    "the distribution of estimated velocity errors for each velocity component is shown in figure 8 .",
    "in figure 9 , we show the run of velocities as a function of distance from the sun ( top ) , distance from the galactic plane ( middle ) , and distance from gc ( bottom )",
    ". left , middle and right rows show @xmath64 and @xmath60 respectively . for @xmath58 and @xmath60",
    "we also show a moving average to be compared with the expected value of 0 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "while @xmath60 is consistent with an average of 0 km  s@xmath2 for the entire @xmath65 and @xmath66 ranges , @xmath58 has a mean of 0 km  s@xmath2 only for stars within @xmath8 kpc from the sun .",
    "the slight departure of @xmath60 from 0 km  s@xmath2 in the plot as a function of @xmath67 at the extremes of the @xmath67 range is due to small - number statistics at the edges , and thus is not significant .    for the entire sample ,",
    "we obtain an average @xmath68 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath69 km  s@xmath2 . while @xmath60 is only marginally different from 0 , @xmath58 is significantly different from 0 .",
    "if we split the sample into a nearby subsample with @xmath70 kpc and a distant subsample with @xmath71 kpc , we obtain : 1 ) @xmath72 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath73 km  s@xmath2 for 1053 stars , and 2 ) @xmath74 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath75 km  s@xmath2 for 3367 stars .",
    "clearly the distant subsample behaves differently than the local one .",
    "we have also split the entire sample of 4420 stars into subsamples above and below the plane to check if a kinematical asymmetry is responsible for this non - zero @xmath58 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath76 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath77 km  s@xmath2 for 1225 stars above the plane , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 km  s@xmath2 for 3195 stars below the plane .",
    "the non - zero @xmath58 is significant in both samples .",
    "the below - the - plane sample , that may include in quadrant one part of the larsen & humphreys ( 1996 ) overdensity ( see section 3 ) , is thus not solely responsible for the non - zero @xmath58 .    to further explore the origin of this non - zero @xmath58 , we have tested other values for the solar peculiar motion and for lsr s rotation . using the schonrich et al .",
    "( 2010 ) solar peculiar motion , ( @xmath80 km  s@xmath2 , we obtain @xmath81 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath69 km  s@xmath2 for the entire sample . adopting the schonrich et al .",
    "( 2010 ) solar peculiar motion , and the rotation of the lsr , @xmath82 km  s@xmath2 ( reid et al .",
    "2009 ) , we obtain @xmath83 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath84 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath58 is still at @xmath85 level different from 0 .",
    "other possible sources for this unexpected result are of course systematics in the observed quantities , of which the most suspect are the proper motions and distances .",
    "first we test the distance , i.e. , modify it in order to obtain an average @xmath86 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we found that all distances have to be a factor of 0.5 smaller in order to satisfy our requirement .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude difference of 1.5 , or the absolute magnitude of red clump stars has to be wrong by this amount , which seems unrealistic .",
    "next , we vary the proper motions in one coordinate e.g. , ra ( keeping the distance and proper motions in the other coordinate fixed ) , first by adding an offset to it , and then introducing a slope with magnitude .",
    "the offset mimics an incorrect absolute proper motion correction , while the slope with magnitude mimics magnitude - dependent systematics present in the proper motions .",
    "we found that we need an offset of 8 mas  yr@xmath2 in order to satisfy our requirement ; in which case the averages are @xmath87 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath88 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "a slope of 3 mas  yr@xmath2  mag@xmath2 gives @xmath89 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath90 km  s@xmath2 , neither being satisfactory .",
    "we repeat this test by varying the proper motion along dec . , and keeping the other quantities fixed . here , within the range explored , we find no satisfactory solution , because as @xmath58 nears low values , @xmath60 becomes @xmath85 different from zero .",
    "we note that an offset of 8 mas  yr@xmath2 in the absolute zero point of spm4 is a huge and unrealistic value , since these systematics are expected to be of the order of 1 - 2 mas  yr@xmath2 ( girard et al .",
    "likewise a slope of 3 mas  yr@xmath2  mag@xmath2 , is completely unacceptable for the spm4 catalog , and in general for the spm material and reductions .",
    "we remind the reader that our result for the absolute proper motion of cluster m 4 ( dinescu et al . 1999 ) obtained with spm data is within 0.5 mas  yr@xmath2 of the result obtained with hst data ( bedin et al . 2003 ,",
    "kalirai et al .",
    "the ground - based result uses data in a much brighter magnitude range than the hst result : the first is tied to @xmath11 , the other to one qso , and to galaxies .",
    "thus , there is no reason to believe that systematics of @xmath91 mas  yr@xmath2  mag@xmath2 are present in the spm data .    to obtain acceptable values for @xmath58 * and * @xmath60 , we need to have both proper - motion coordinates offset by 3 mas  yr@xmath2 , or both with slopes of 3 and 1 mas  yr@xmath2  mag@xmath2 .",
    "systematic errors this large in the spm4 catalog are unrealistic .",
    "we turn now to an exploration of the literature regarding this issue .",
    "we consider only the most recent kinematical studies that include large samples of stars , with well determined distances , proper motions and radial velocities , and , when possible , homogeneous data .",
    "one recent study that uses sdss data in stripe 82 is that by smith et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . that study uses a sample of 1700 halo subdwarfs , where radial velocities are from sdss spectra , and the proper motions are determined only from sdss data in stripe 82 which has repeated observations over a period of 7 years ( bramich et al .",
    "their derived values are @xmath92 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath93 km  s@xmath2 , for a sample spanning a heliocentric distance between 1 and 5 kpc .",

    "( 2009 ) admit that this result for @xmath58 is significantly different from the nominal zero , and suggest various causes for it such as kinematical substructure ; systematic errors in proper motions , distances or radial velocities ; the presence of binary stars .",
    "another study is that of @xmath94 metal - rich red giants at the south galactic pole ( sgp ) done by girard et al .",
    "this study used proper motions from an earlier version of the spm catalog ( namely spm3 , girard et al .",
    "2004 ) , and photometric distances estimated from 2mass photometry . at the sgp , the proper motions are directly projected into @xmath95 velocities .",
    "while the study focuses on the shear of the thick disk , they obtained an average velocity with respect to the sun of @xmath96 km  s@xmath2 at an average 2.2 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "taking into account the solar peculiar motion , their result is @xmath97 km  s@xmath2 , in agreement with ours and with smith et al .",
    "we note that the girard et al .",
    "( 2006 ) study used different tracers ( @xmath98 ) than our current study .",
    "another study of red clump giants at the north galactic pole ( ngp ) was made by rybka & yatsenko ( 2009 ) .",
    "the red clump stars were selected from 2mass in the traditional color range @xmath99 , and the proper motions come from various catalogs including tycho2 and ucac2 . using @xmath100 stars between 1 and 3 kpc from the sun , they obtain an average velocity with respect to the lsr of @xmath101 km  s@xmath2 , in agreement with our result , and the results mentioned above .    two additional recent kinematical studies using sdss dr7 data are those by c10 and b10 .",
    "the c10 study focuses on `` calibration '' stars , or a subsample of the sdss data , while the b10 study uses all sdss data .",
    "both studies analyze dwarf stars ( of the halo and disk ) , have the same photometric distance calibration described in ivezi et al .",

    "2004 , 2008 ) .",
    "radial velocities are obtained from sdss spectra ( see details in c10 and b10 ) . both studies have samples of tens of thousand of stars with heliocentric distances well outside the 1-kpc limit .",
    "neither study gives the average @xmath102 for the entire sample , thus we can judge a small positive offset only from the plots presented .",
    "figure 6 in c10 shows histograms of each velocity component for various metallicity bins .",

    "however , in their figure 7 , where they show the run of the median @xmath58 as a function of distance from the plane , there appears to be a small positive offset for stars between 1.5 and 3 kpc .      assuming the offset in @xmath58 is real , we believe that , rather than having the entire galaxy expand , it is more realistic to assume that stars in the solar neighborhood ( within @xmath8 kpc from the sun ) move inward , toward the gc compared to more distant stars that better represent a galactic rest frame . if this is the case , then radial - velocity studies at low latitude and toward the galactic center and anticenter should confirm / disprove this . in other words , bulge stars for instance should have an average radial velocity toward us , and stars at the anticenter ( and beyond 1 kpc from the sun )",
    "should have an average radial velocity away from us .",

    "our investigation shows that local stars ( lesser than @xmath8 kpc from the sun ) do not exhibit a net @xmath58 motion , and thus @xmath11-based results , for instance , are unlikely to detect this",
    ". however , more distant samples with full 3d velocities do detect it .",
    "it is thus apparent that the entire local sample of stars has a net inward motion toward the gc , while the vertical motion remains zero .",
    "the first thought that comes to mind is that this is due to some noncircular motion induced by perturbations in the disk , such as spiral arms and/or bar .",
    "indeed , a recent paper by quillen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) shows @xmath113 maps of various neighborhoods that sample the disk of a n - body simulated galaxy .",
    "these neighborhoods are placed at various radii from the galactic center , and various angles from the bar .",
    "the maps show velocity clumps and arcs induced by the bar and spiral pattern , that are offset from a mean of zero in velocity .",
    "velocity offsets of these features can be easly as large as @xmath114 km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus our offset of @xmath115 km s@xmath2 for the entire local solar neighborhood is quite within the ranges predicted in quillen et al .",
    "in figure 10 we show the run of each velocity component as a function of distance from the galactic plane @xmath66 ; the averages in the top panel and the dispersions in the bottom panel .",
    "the data are grouped in bins of equal number of stars , here with 124 stars per bin .",
    "the data are restricted to a galactocentric radius range of @xmath116 kpc .",
    "the average in each bin is calculated using probability plots ( hamaker 1978 ) trimmed at @xmath63 on each side , and the uncertainty in the average is derived from the dispersion , also determined from probability plots . the bottom plot of fig .",
    "10 shows the _ intrinsic _ velocity dispersions , i.e. , corrected for velocity errors .",
    "intrinsic velocity dispersions are calculated as follows .",
    "we start with an initial guess of the intrinsic dispersion . for each point",
    "we calculate the square of the quadrature sum of this intrinsic dispersion and its velocity error , and we divide this number with the point s deviation from the mean . for all points",
    "this ratio should have a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1 , if the intrinsic dispersion is correct . if not , the initial intrinsic dispersion is adjusted and the procedure is repeated until we satisfy the above condition .",
    "the top plot shows the variation of the rotation velocity @xmath59 as a function of @xmath66 ; of @xmath58 , which is offset from 0 km  s@xmath2 at z - distances larger than @xmath117 kpc as discussed in the previous section ; and of @xmath60 , which is consistent with 0 km  s@xmath2 .    the bottom plot , which displays the velocity dispersions as a function of @xmath66 , clearly shows the transition between the thin and thick disks . at @xmath118 kpc ,",
    "the sample is dominated by thin - disk red clump stars reflected in the low dispersion in all three components : @xmath119 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this dispersion increases rapidly between @xmath120 and 1 kpc in all three components , to reach values of @xmath121 km  s@xmath2 at 1 kpc from the plane .",
    "this rapid increase reflects the mixture between the thin disk population with its low velocity dispersion and the thick disk population with a large dispersion . before correcting for the contribution of the thin disk",
    ", we would like to discuss the results of three other studies .",
    "the continuous lines with corresponding colors for each velocity component show the dispersion dependence on @xmath66 as determined by b10 for sdss data for disk , dwarf stars .",
    "these stars were selected to be among the `` blue stars '' , specifically with @xmath122 , and @xmath123 ( and two other criteria for combined colors , see b10 ) , as well as to have photometrically - determined metallicities [ fe / h ]  @xmath124 .",
    "thus the metal rich end is determined by the color cuts , and the sample is thought to represent the thick disk according to metallicity . in all three velocity components , the dispersions determined by b10 , are substantially smaller than our values , except at @xmath125 kpc .",
    "in fact , the b10 values appear to reflect the kinematics of the thin disk rather than the thick disk . in the same plot",
    ", we show the run of velocity dispersions determined by girard et al .",
    "( 2006 ) at the sgp from the analysis of metal - rich , thick - disk giants .",
    "these values are more in line with what we obtain at @xmath126 kpc ; however our values have yet to be corrected for the contamination of the thin disk contribution , a correction that will push the dispersion to higher values .",
    "we add one more estimate of the dispersions , that determined by c10 from sdss data for dwarf stars .",
    "their thick - disk sample is selected to be in the metallicity range [ fe / h ] = ( -0.8 , -0.6 ) , where metallicities are determined from sdss spectra .",
    "the dispersions are estimated for stars within @xmath127 kpc . at an average @xmath128 kpc",
    ", they obtain @xmath129 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these values are not corrected for observational errors in the velocities , which are assumed to be on the order of @xmath130 km  s@xmath2 ( c10 ) .",
    "we represent the c10 dispersions with a triangle symbol in our fig .",
    "9 . while their dispersions in the rotation and vertical component agree with ours , and are larger than the b10 values , the dispersion in the radial direction is substantially smaller than our value .",
    "it is also somewhat intriguing that the radial velocity dispersion is practically equal to the rotation velocity dispersion , clearly different from other thick - disk studies where the radial dispersion is larger by 20 to @xmath131 .    in light of the results summarized here , the b10 velocity dispersions seem unusually low , and it is worth exploring this a bit further .",
    "the c10 study used color cuts of `` bluer '' limits than b10 , specifically , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , and a metallicity range with a cutoff at the high end .",
    "their dispersions are larger than those in b10 .",
    "it is thus likely that the b10 sample of `` disk '' stars is significantly contaminated by thin disk stars .",
    "next we determine the velocity and velocity dispersion gradients , taking into account the contamination by thin - disk stars . as a first guess for the contribution of the thin disk in our sample , we use the density laws determined by cabrera - lavers et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter c05 ) from starcounts of red clump stars in 2mass .",
    "the density laws are expressed as exponential functions of @xmath66 , with given scale heights for the thin and thick disks , and a given normalization of thick to thin disk stars .",
    "we show two parametrizations : 1 ) @xmath134 pc , @xmath135 pc , and a local normalization of @xmath136 thick disk stars to thin disk , and 2 ) @xmath137 pc , @xmath138 pc , and a local normalization of @xmath139 thick disk stars to thin disk . in figure 11",
    "we show the fraction of thin disk stars ( in @xmath140 ) as a function of @xmath66 for the two descriptions . at @xmath8 kpc , these descriptions indicate that the contribution of thin disk is between @xmath141 and @xmath142 of the total stars .",
    "our sample has a magnitude - selection imposed by the input rave catalog that affects this ratio that was derived for complete samples .",
    "instead we choose to derive this ratio from our data by modeling the distribution of @xmath59 as the sum of two gaussians : one representing the thin disk , the other the thick disk .",
    "the mean velocity of the thin disk is fixed at 220 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we determine via @xmath143 minimization of the @xmath59 distribution the velocity dispersions of the thin and thick disks , the fraction of thin disk stars , and the mean velocity of the thick disk .",
    "we divide our sample into three @xmath66 bins : a ) from 0.3 to 0.5 kpc , b ) from 0.5 to 1.0 kpc , and c ) from 1.0 to 1.5 kpc and apply this procedure for each bin . in table 1 we show the best - fit results for each bin .",
    "rrrrrr + & & & & & + & & & & & +   + & & & & & + & & & & & + & & & & & +    the first z - bin is poorly constrained , due to the proximity of the rotation velocity of the thick disk to that of the thin disk .",
    "the next two z - bins have reasonable fits , with the middle one probably the best , due to the number of stars included .",
    "if we use the two c05 laws , but normalize such that the thin - to - thick disk ratio is set by the @xmath144 kpc result from tab . 1 , we obtain the dashed lines shown in fig . 11 .",
    "this indicates that the thin - disk contamination is lower than that based directly on the c05 laws .",
    "determinations from all three bins shown in tab . 1",
    ", are also plotted in fig .",
    "the most distant point from the plane is in reasonable agreement with the predicted values , while the nearest is simply a poor constraint .",
    "since the two c05 laws are very similar with this new normalization at @xmath145 kpc , we will adopt only one to correct the velocity dispersions , namely the one with the higher scale height ( dashed black line in fig .",
    "we correct the measured dispersions due to the contamination of the thin disk in the following way .",
    "the measured dispersion is :    @xmath146    where , @xmath147 is the fraction of thin disk stars , and @xmath148 is the dispersion of thin disk stars , while @xmath149 is the fraction of thick disk stars , and @xmath150 is the dispersion of thick disk stars .",
    "we derive @xmath150 by adopting the fraction of thin and thick disk stars at each @xmath66 from the relationship presented above , and adopting the following dispersions for the old , thin disk : @xmath151 km  s@xmath2 ( nordstrom et al .",
    "this correction is applicable if the mean velocities for thin and thick disk are the same , and thus can be applied in principle only to the @xmath58 and @xmath60 components . to understand the influence of thin - disk contamination on @xmath59 , we use monte carlo simulations to generate a population of thin and thick disk stars .",
    "a set of 10000 points are generated at a series of @xmath66 values .",
    "velocities are drawn from gaussian distributions of given means and dispersions that resemble the thin and thick disks .",
    "the thick disk rotation velocity varies linearly with @xmath66 , with a gradient similar to that seen in observations .",
    "velocities obtained this way are then smoothed with velocity errors , these being drawn from the observed distribution of errors in @xmath59 .",
    "the fraction of thin disk stars as a function of @xmath66 is that given by the c05 law , normalized with our data .",
    "we then calculate the average and the dispersion at each @xmath66 value , applying the same procedure as with the observed data , i.e. , probability plots for averages , and the intrinsic dispersion routine that eliminates measurement errors from the observed dispersions .",
    "we then compare these determined values with those from the input .",
    "we find that the dispersion correction is small ( less than 2 km  s@xmath2 ) for @xmath152 kpc , and similar to the correction given by equation 1 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the thin disk fraction is small at this distance from the plane ( @xmath153 at @xmath154 kpc , see fig .",

    "this however does not represent disagreement , since the actual dependence is not linear .",

    "however they can be approximated with linear functions over limited @xmath66 ranges . toward low @xmath66 values ,",

    "( 2006 ) from 1 to 4 kpc , the dispersion gradient is shallower than ours where the range is from 0.7 to 2.5 kpc .",
    "finally , we estimate the gradient of @xmath59 as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "our simulations show that the average @xmath59 is affected by the thin - disk contamination out to @xmath159 kpc , where the bias is about the size of the error in the average velocity ( i.e. @xmath160 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "only three bins in our dataset are beyond this @xmath66 value .",

    "we apply this bias to all of our our data bins , and then fit a line to obtain a gradient @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 , with @xmath161 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "since we are uncertain of the thin - disk fraction at low @xmath66 values , and therefore of the correction to be applied , we provide yet another estimate of the gradient .",

    "it is not trivial to make a meaningful comparison between models , since each study is focused on a different aspect of this process : likelihood of disk survival , structure and orbits of accreted satellites , structural parameters of the thick disk , various kinematical features of the thick disk , abundance patterns , etc .",
    "however , a comparative study is presented by sales et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who use four models from the literature and propose as a discriminator the distribution of the orbital eccentricity .",
    "the four models are radial migration ( roskar et al .",

    "2004 ) .    here , we compare the eccentricity distribution of our observed thick - disk sample with those of the four models from sales et al .",

    "the scale lengths of the models vary between 3 and 4 kpc ( tab . 1 in sales et al .",

    "( 2003 ) model ; our entire sample does not extend beyond @xmath285 kpc ( see fig .",
    "the sample considered here for the eccentricity distribution consists of 1573 stars .",
    "eccentricities are calculated as @xmath286 , where @xmath287 and @xmath288 are the apo- and pericenter distances . to account for errors in the observed quantities , we run simulations with",
    "randomly generated proper motions , distances and radial velocities , as drawn from the gaussian distributions of their errors .",

    "( 2010 ) , for a sample at higher @xmath66 that better matches the selection criteria of the model , but is still in disagreement with the resulting eccentricity distribution . their conclusion is similar to ours : there are not enough high eccentricity stars to satisfy the model distribution .",
    "similarly , the radial migration model is difficult to reconcile with the observations ; there are not enough low eccentricity stars , and there are too many high eccentricity stars in the observations compared to the model .",
    "the two most favored models by our observations are the dynamical heating due to a minor merger , and the gas - rich merging .",
    "indeed , the major peak of the distribution and its long tail are well reproduced by both models . even if our observations do not have a secondary peak at very high eccentricities , as the heating model displays , this in not necessarily a strong disagreement . in the model",
    ", the secondary peak is due to stars from the merging satellite , and these preserve the initial orbit of the satellite .",
    "a less eccentric initial orbit of the satellite may very well produce a distribution more in line with the observed one ( see also wilson et al .",
    "2010 for a similar conclusion ) .",
    "another quantity to be used as a robust discriminator is the rotation velocity gradient with @xmath174 , which here is found to be @xmath289 km  s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 , and nearly -30 km  s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 in girard et al .",

    "a rather large gradient ( consistent with the values presented here ) is also predicted by the dynamical heating model of villalobos & helmi ( 2008 ) , provided the satellite is on a low inclination ( @xmath290 ) orbit .",
    "in fact , the dependence of @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath175 as a function of @xmath67 seen in our sample are also consistent with the predictions of the low - inclination heating event described in villalobos & helmi ( 2008 ) : @xmath291 , @xmath292 are nearly constant , while @xmath175 decreases slowly with increasing @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "13 ) . as a next step , it would be interesting to compare the predictions from the brook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model with our results for velocity and velocity - dispersion gradients with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , to further help discriminate between models .",

    "loebman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue that the lack of correlation between these quantities ( as observed by sdss ) favors the radial mixing model .",

    "we find that stars more distant than 0.7 kpc from the sun have a net radial velocity of @xmath294 km  s@xmath2 , in the galactic rest frame , while the vertical velocity is consistent with zero .",
    "some recent studies using different tracers and probing different volumes in the galaxy also show this offset .",
    "we argue that this motion is real , and we interpret it as a mean motion of the lsr as defined by local samples , rather than an expansion of the galaxy .    after removing the contribution of the thin disk",

    "<S> we analyze the 3d kinematics of a sample of @xmath0 red clump stars ranging between 5 and 10 kpc from the galactic center and up to 3 kpc from the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> this sample is representative for the metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] = -0.6 to 0.5 ) thick disk . </S>",
    "<S> absolute proper motions are from the fourth release of the southern proper motion program , and radial velocities from the second release of the radial velocity experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the derived kinematical properties of the thick disk include : the rotational velocity gradient @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 , velocity dispersions @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 , and velocity - ellipsoid tilt angle @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our dynamical estimate of the thin - disk scale length is @xmath5 kpc and the thick - disk scale height is @xmath6 kpc .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed orbital eccentricity distribution compared with those from four different models of the formation of the thick disk from sales et al .  favor the gas - rich merger model and the minor merger heating model .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when referred to the currently accepted value of the lsr , stars more distant than 0.7 kpc from the sun show a net average radial velocity of @xmath7 km  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is seen in previous kinematical studies using other tracers at distances larger than @xmath8 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest this motion reflects an inward perturbation of the locally - defined lsr induced by the spiral density wave . </S>"
