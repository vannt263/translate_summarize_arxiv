    "magnetic properties of quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) organic conductors have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically since a discovery of the so - called field - induced spin - density - wave ( fisdw ) phase diagrams@xmath2 . for open electron orbits ,",
    "where the landau levels quantization is impossible , as theoretically shown@xmath3 , other quantum effects - the bragg reflections of electrons from the brillouin zones - play an important role . in the simplest situation , where magnetic field is perpendicular to conducting layers of q1d conductors , the bragg reflections are demonstrated@xmath4 to be responsible for the fisdw phases formation . in an inclined magnetic field ,",
    "perpendicular to conducting chains , a more complicated interference picture of electrons , moving in the extended brillouin zones , appears . as shown in refs .",
    "6 and 7 , it results in the constructive interference of electron waves in some many - body effects for some special commensurate directions of a magnetic field , which are called the lebed magic angles ( lma ) .",
    "the lma effects were experimentally discovered in refs .",
    "8 - 13 and are observed in a number of organic conductors@xmath5 , which possess q1d parts in their fermi surfaces ( fs ) .",

    ", it was shown that constructive interference effects@xmath8 could appear in such one - body phenomenon as a residual resistivity due to impurities . as a result ,",

    "31 was based on an incorrect solution of the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "recently , a correct solution of the boltzmann equation for a magnetic field , perpendicular to conducting chains of a q1d conductor , was found and the existence of the strong lma minima in perpendicular to conducting layers component of resistivity was firmly established@xmath10 .",
    "in addition , a quantum mechanical variant of the theory was suggested@xmath11 .",
    "theory@xmath11 reveals quantum interference nature of periodic solutions of the boltzmann kinetic equation in the extended brillouin zone@xmath10 , which lead to the appearance of the lma effects . according to ref .",
    "33 , the lma minima of resistivity appear due to changes of electron wave functions dimensionality from 1d into 2d at commensurate directions of a magnetic field@xmath8 due to constructive interference effects .",
    "these interference effects appear between velocity component , perpendicular to conducting layers , and the density of states@xmath11 .",
    "note that the theory@xmath12 , which is a limiting case of the unification theory , suggested in this paper , can explain the experimental observations of the lma effects only in resistivity@xmath6 .",
    "as to the observations of anomalously strong lma phenomena in the nernst@xmath13 and hall@xmath14 effects , their explanations may need a different theoretical approach .    as experimentally discovered@xmath15 ,",
    "the lma - like magnetoresistance minima with enhanced magnitudes are observed@xmath16 in experimental geometry , where magnetic field is inclined with respect to conducting chains of a q1d conductor . at first , these angular oscillations were interpreted@xmath17 in terms of the lma phenomenon .",
    "later , it became clear@xmath18 that , although they are related to the lma effects , their concrete physical meaning is quite different .",
