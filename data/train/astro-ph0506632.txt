    "since the era of the einstein observatory , many compact x - ray sources have been detected in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sources with x - ray luminosities below @xmath6 , which corresponds to the eddington limit for a neutron star of @xmath7 , can be accreting neutron stars , while those with higher luminosities can be considered as black hole binaries ( hereafter , bhb ) . the most luminous class of compact objects , known as ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources ( ulxs ; @xcite ) , show x - ray luminosity of @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "supposing that ulxs obey the eddington limit , their high luminosities imply that they are accreting black holes as massive as 10100@xmath10 or more .",
    "such luminous x - ray objects , which are rather rare in our galaxy and lmc , are suggested to reside preferentially in galaxies with high star - formation activities @xcite .",
    "therefore , starburst galaxies provide a good opportunity to study stellar black holes of various masses .    in studying galactic / magellanic bhbs ,",
    "intensity - correlated spectral changes have been used as a key diagnostic tool .",
    "when the luminosity is above @xmath11 of the eddington limit , a bhb is often in the standard - disk ( alternatively called high or soft ) state , wherein the x - ray spectrum is successfully described by a so - called multi - color disk model ( mcd model ; @xcite ) , predicted by the theory of optically thick standard accretion disks .",
    "the bolometric disk luminosity , @xmath12 , varies as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the highest color temperature of the disk .",
    "equivalently , the calculated innermost disk radius , @xmath15 , stays constant , at a value consistent with the radius of the last stable orbit around the black hole . as",
    "the source becomes more luminous ( close to the eddington limit ) , @xmath15 apparently becomes variable , as @xmath16 , probably because the disk makes a transition into a slim disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a very similar behavior has been observed for several of the most luminous ulxs , which show mcd - like spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore of keen interest to look for such intensity - correlated spectral changes among extragalactic bhb candidates , in particular including those with lower luminosities , and to examine whether the behavior indicates standard disks or slim - disks .    with this perspective",
    ", we analyzed the xmm - newton and chandra data of ngc  253 x21 ( @xcite ; also named source  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the nearby sc - type edge - on galaxy ngc  253 ( at a distance of 2.58  mpc ; @xcite ) is one of the well - known starburst galaxies with prominent diffuse x - ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many point - like x - ray sources have also been detected since the era of the einstein observatory . among them",
    ", x21 is one of the brightest sources , located approximately @xmath17 southwest from the center of this galaxy .",
    "@xcite showed that this source is time - variable by analyzing rosat data , and @xcite analyzed the xmm - newton data of x21 and reported that its luminosity varied by a factor of @xmath18 during a 40  ks observation . in a large sample of ulxs observed with chandra and xmm - newton @xcite , this source showed a large luminosity variation in the range of @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "therefore , this object deserves a detailed study in comparison with galactic / magellanic bhbs .",
    "the xmm - newton @xcite observation of ngc  253 , to be utilized in the present paper , was carried out on 2000 june 3 .",
    "the data , retrieved from the xmm - newton archive , were processed using the science analysis system ( sas ) , version 5.4.1 . to create response matrices ,",
    "the software package rmfgen was used .",
    "since x21 was located on the ccd gap of the pn detector @xcite during the observation , the present paper utilizes only the mos ( mos  1 and mos  2 ; @xcite ) data . for each epic camera ,",
    "events with pattern 0 to 12 were accumulated over a region of @xmath21 , centered on the x21 image .",
    "a total of 35  ks of good data were obtained for the two mos cameras by discarding the time region of a short background time flare .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_mos ] shows a 0.510  kev light curve with an average count rate of each mos camera of @xmath22 , which roughly gives a 0.510  kev flux of @xmath23 . as shown by the dashed line at the bottom , the background counts were negligible ( @xmath24 of the source counts in this range ) .",
    "the signal count rate varied by a factor of two , as already reported by @xcite .",
    "the present work also utilized a chandra @xcite observation of ngc  253 , performed on 1999 december 16 .",
    "the chandra data consisted of a net exposure of 14  ks , when the target source was on the s3 chip .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using ciao software version 2.3 , and the response matrix was made with mkrmf .",
    "the source events were extracted from a circular region of @xmath25 radius around the source centroid .",
    "the average 0.510  kev count rate was 0.06  @xmath26 , which corresponded to a 0.510  kev energy flux of @xmath27 , a factor of three lower than the average flux observed with xmm - newton .",
    "there was no significant time variation beyond the poisson noise .",

    "figure [ fig : spec_mos_av ] shows the time - averaged spectra of x21 obtained with the xmm - newton mos cameras .",
    "the background events were extracted from a source - free circular region of @xmath48 radius on the same chip as the source . following the previous studies on ulxs ( e.g. @xcite ) , the mcd model and a single power law ( pl ) model were fit to the spectra .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : fit_par ] , the mcd model successfully describes the observed spectra with @xmath49 , while the pl model is less successful with @xmath50 .",
    "the value of the hydrogen column density , @xmath28 , obtained with the mcd fit , is roughly consistent with the line - of - sight galactic value of @xmath51 @xcite , while that with the pl model is by a factor of 20 higher than the galactic value .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath28 estimated from the mcd fit is consistent with the value from a spectral analysis of diffuse emission in this region of ngc  253 reported by @xcite .",
    "thus , the mcd model explains the data more appropriately than the pl model .",
    "employing a correction factor for the inner - boundary condition of @xmath52 @xcite and a color - to - effective temperature correction factor of @xmath53 , the best - fit mcd model yields the innermost disk radius , @xmath54  km with @xmath55 , where @xmath3 is the inclination of the system . by using a formula for the disk bolometric luminosity , @xmath12 , by @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the stefan  boltzmann constant , @xmath12",
    "is then calculated as @xmath58 , which corresponds to the eddington limit of a @xmath59 object .",
    "an mcd plus pl model with a fixed photon index of @xmath60 gives essentially the same result within 90% errors , because the pl component in this two - component fit is not significant .",
    "( 85mm,70mm)./figure3.eps    the chandra acis spectrum of x21 was analyzed in the same manner .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_acis ] shows the obtained source spectrum , after subtracting the background spectrum , which was extracted from a source - free circular region of @xmath61 radius on the same chip as the source .",
    "the spectrum was fit with the mcd model and the pl model , as was done for the xmm - newton data .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : fit_par ] , the spectrum can be described by either model because of the poor statistics . however , the mcd fit is again more reasonable from the viewpoint of @xmath28 .",
    "the chandra data thus yield @xmath62  km and @xmath63 . between the xmm - newton and the chandra observations ,",
    "the value of @xmath15 was kept almost constant at @xmath64 km , while @xmath12 changed by a factor of three .",
    "( 85mm,70mm)./figure4.eps      as shown in figure  [ fig : lc_mos ] and reported by @xcite , x21 exhibited a significant intensity variation by a factor of two during the xmm - newton observation .",
    "accordingly , the entire observational span was split into three periods ; covering low - flux , middle - flux , and high - flux periods , as denoted by the three arrows in the figure .",
    "spectra constructed from each period were investigated with the absorbed mcd model to clarify the spectral evolution in response to the intensity change .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : fit_par ] , this model reproduced each spectrum very well .",
    "figure  [ fig : tin_rin ] shows the values of @xmath15 against @xmath14 , based on the intensity - sorted xmm - newton spectra ( filled inverted triangles ) and the chandra spectrum ( filled square ) .",
    "it clearly shows that the value of @xmath15 remained constant during the significant variation of @xmath14 .",
    "the data points are consistent with the behavior of bhbs in the standard - disk state , where @xmath15 remained constant .",
    "the average value of @xmath15 is determined as @xmath65 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] , the calculated values of @xmath12 are plotted against @xmath14 for each period , in order to examine the spectral behavior against the luminosity .",
    "this diagram shows that the data points satisfy the relation @xmath66 as @xmath12 changes over ( 0.31.3 ) @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , a logarithmic slope of @xmath68 is obtained when these data points are fitted with a power law .",
    "through the combined use of archival chandra and xmm - newton data , an overall luminosity change by a factor of three was observed from ngc  253 x21 .",
    "the x - ray spectra at all intensity levels were successfully described by the mcd model , and the highest disk luminosity reached @xmath69 .",
    "this luminosity , on one hand , is the lowest among those of ulxs . on the other hand ,",
    "this source is shinning at a higher luminosity than most galactic / magellanic sources . except for a few examples , such as grs  @xmath70 and xte  j@xmath71 in its outburst peak , no compact x - ray source in our galaxy",
    "has so far exhibited a luminosity higher than @xmath72 ( e.g. , ; @xcite ) .    in order to study the spectral behavior of x21 compared with luminous ulxs and xte  j@xmath71 , which is a representative galactic bhb ,",
    "their @xmath14@xmath12 relations are plotted together in figure  [ fig : hr ] . while the luminosities of luminous ulxs are observed to vary as @xmath73 , that of ngc  253 x21 varied as @xmath74 .",
    "the latter relation is considered to be a signature of standard accretion disks , as has been observed from a fair number of bhbs , including xte  j@xmath71 , lmc  x-3 @xcite , gs  @xmath75 @xcite , and gs  @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the present results thus provide one of the first confirmations of the standard - disk property in bhb candidates outside the local group of galaxies .",
    "as shown in section 3 , the value of @xmath15 of x21 was estimated to be @xmath77  km .",
    "the innermost stable orbit of a non - rotating bh is given as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "thus , the mass of the central black hole of this source is estimated to be @xmath80 .",
    "this is a very common value found among bhbs in our galaxy and lmc ( e.g. , ) .",
    "thus , the observed disk luminosity of ( 0.31.3)@xmath81 corresonds to ( 30@xmath82  % of the eddington limit for the inferred bh mass . therefore , ngc  253 x21 can be understood consistently as an accreting bh with an ordinary stellar mass , in which a standard accretion disk is radiating at a fair fraction of the eddington limit .",
    "in particular , the observed values of @xmath831.4  kev are reasonable for the inferred bh mass and luminosity , thus making x21 free from the problem of `` too high a disk temperature '' observed from the most luminous ulxs @xcite .    according to the present results , the least - luminous class of the entire ulxs population may contain ordinary bhbs .",
    "similar examples include m  33 x-8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ngc  2403 x-3 @xcite , and ngc  4449 source  2 @xcite .",
    "future studies of luminosity - correlated spectral evolution with a larger sample of extragalactic x - ray point sources will elucidate the detailed composition of ulxs .",
