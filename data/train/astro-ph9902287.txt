    "the richness is an important defining attribute of a galaxy cluster , yet has always proven to be difficult to quantify rigorously .",
    "abell ( 1958 ) , in creating the first comprehensive catalog of rich galaxy clusters , defined the richness classification which now bears his name based on the number of galaxies within 2 mag of the third ranking galaxy in an angular area of radius 1.7/@xmath5 , or about 3 mpc ( for @xmath6 km s @xmath7 mpc @xmath7 ) .",
    "the procedure that abell used in counting the number of galaxies from palomar sky survey prints must be considered approximate , and difficult to extend to higher redshift .",
    "the accuracy of the abell classification for abell clusters is accurate probably to only about 1 class ( e.g. , see dressler 1978 ) .",
    "uncertainties can arise from many sources : inaccurate estimate of photometry , poor star - galaxy classification , incorrect background correction , contamination from foreground or background clusters , and large uncertainty in the estimated redshift .",
    "in addition , the relatively large area used for the counting increases the chance of contaminating projections . at higher redshift , most of these problems would only be magnified , making a similar richness classification impractical without additional data such as accurate photometry and redshift .",
    "furthermore , at redshifts higher than @xmath80.2 , it becomes increasingly more difficult , if not impossible , to specify , for example , the third brightest cluster member , due to the large number of foreground galaxies .",
    "a robust richness measurement for galaxy clusters is an important observational quantity . beside being one of the primary attributes of a cluster , it can be used as a baseline for comparing other properties of clusters in a meaningful way .",
    "this is especially important as advances in technology have allowed us to study galaxy clusters at different epochs and at increasingly higher redshifts , up to and above 1 ( e.g. , dickinson 1997 ) .",
    "ultimately , a more fundamental parameter is the mass of the cluster .",
    "however , there is evidence that the richness of a cluster , properly determined , can be a good predictor of the mass of the cluster ( carlberg et al .",
    "1996 , and yee et al .",
    "1999 ) based on results from the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey .",
    "various attempts have been carried out to produce a more accurate measure of the richness of abell clusters .",
    "these include the @xmath9 of bahcall ( 1981 ) , and the revised abell count numbers , @xmath0 , of abell , corwin , & olowin ( 1989 , hereafter aco ) .",
    "to arrive at a robust and rigorous quantitative measure of cluster richness , three observational issues must be taken into account when counting the number of galaxies in a cluster : the angular coverage , the depth of the observation , and the background correction .",
    "the availability of wide field digital imaging due to advances in large format ccds has enabled us to address these issues quantitatively much better .",
    "the wide field allows us to sample the bulk of even very low redshift clusters , and digital imaging provides us with accurate photometry , which is vital for determining the depth of the galaxy counts , and correcting for background .",
    "in addition , a useful quantitative richness measure is one that can be applied uniformly to different samples at vastly different redshifts .",
    "the cluster - center galaxy correlation amplitude ( ) , first used by longair & seldner ( 1979 ) to quantify the environment of radio galaxies , is one parameter that appears to be well - suited as a robust richness parameter . by assuming an universal luminosity function ( lf ) and spatial profile ,",
    "the excess galaxy counts around any reference point can be properly corrected to create an unbiased estimator of the richness of the environment .",
    "yee & green ( 1987 ) extended the method to study the environment of quasars by using a `` universal '' lf with evolution that is self - consistent with the background galaxy counts .",
    "the ability to track the evolution of the lf at different epochs is extremely important in comparing richness of clusters at different redshifts in a meaningful way .",
    "however , although such a method has been used in many studies of the environments of active objects , fully digital photometric data have not been applied to the quantification and calibration of the richness of ordinary galaxy clusters , such as the abell clusters , and to test the robustness of the parameter .    in this paper , we present the richness measurements , in the form of , for a sample of 47 abell clusters based on digital photometric data .",
    "these measurements can be used as a calibration between the  parameter and the more traditional abell richness class ( hereafter , arc ) .",
    "we show that  is a robust richness estimator , provided that a galaxy lf well matched to that found in clusters is used for normalization .",
    "we find that there is a good correlation between the @xmath0 and  for clusters at @xmath1 with a dispersion of about 1 richness class .",
    "however , @xmath10 , @xmath0 often over - estimates the true richness of abell clusters .    in  2 we present the sample and the data set .",
    "the method for deriving  is briefly discussed in  3 , along with the lfs used in the computation . in ",
    "4 we test the robustness of the  parameter by investigating the dependence of the parameter on various quantities such as the lf , magnitude limit , and sampling area .",
    "section 5 discusses the results and compare the arc with the  parameter .",
    "a summary is presented in  6 . throughout this paper , unless otherwise specified , we use @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "the data used in this work are from a sample of abell clusters originally chosen for a study of correlations between x - ray and optical properties ( the low - redshift cluster optical survey ( locos ) , see lpez - cruz & yee 1999 ) .",

    "the clusters were selected from a compilation of bright x - ray clusters made by jones & foreman ( 1998 ) with the following criteria : ( 1 ) galactic latitude @xmath12 ; ( 2 ) @xmath13 ; ( 3 ) arc@xmath31 ; and ( 4 ) the declination @xmath14 .",
    "although there is an imposed criterion of arc@xmath31 , data for a number of arc=0 clusters were also obtained , often for the purpose of filling right ascension gaps during the observing runs .",
    "the arc=0 clusters are not considered as part of the fair sample .",
    "this is because they were not picked randomly ; ones that appear to be rich or have well - defined x - ray emission were preferentially chosen . nevertheless , they are analysed along with the other clusters , but are used only when such a selection effect does not affect the particular conclusion . as a comparison , the central region of coma ( a1656 , @xmath15 )",
    "was also observed .",
    "the total number of abell clusters in the sample is 47 , with 36 satisfying the criteria listed above .",

    "the integration times varied between 900 to 2500 second , depending on the filter used and the redshift of the cluster .",
    "nine control fields at least @xmath23 away from any cluster fields were also observed for the purpose of background count correction .",
    "these fields were observed and reduced in an identical manner as the cluster fields .",

    "the typical 100% completeness magnitude in @xmath17 is @xmath24 mag .",
    "this provides a range of completeness in absolute @xmath17 magnitudes at the redshift of the clusters from 15.5 to 18.5 .",

    "it was subsequently adopted by yee & green ( 1984 ) to study the environment of quasars using a self - consistent lf estimated from the same data .",
    "further applications of the parameter to the study of the environments of quasars and radio galaxies can be found in yee & green ( 1987 ; hereafter yg87 ) ; ellingson , yee , & green ( 1991 ) ; prestage & peacock ( 1988 ) ; and yates , miller , & peacock ( 1989 ) .",

    "the sensitivity of the  value to the lf will be discussed in detail in  4.1 .",
    "the assumption of a universal lf is not strictly correct , as field and cluster galaxies have different population mixes and evolution histories .",
    "however , for the computation of  using galaxies brighter than @xmath44 mag , the varying faint - end slope of cluster galaxy lf ( lpez - cruz et al .",
    "1997 ) has little or no effect .",
    "we choose to test three lfs derived from very different data sources and methods .",
    "they are all represented functionally by the schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "the three functions are ( 1 ) the lf derived from the clusters themselves ( lpez - cruz & yee 1999 , hereafter the lcy lf ) ; ( 2 ) the low - redshift field galaxy lf from king & ellis ( 1985 , hereafter the ke lf ) ; and ( 3 ) the field galaxy lf from the cnoc2 redshift survey of intermediate redshift galaxies ( lin et al . 1999 , hereafter the cnoc2 lf ) .",
    "the parameters of the lfs are listed in table 2 and the lfs are described in the following .",
    "we will first discuss primarily the shape of the lfs used and defer the description of the normalization of the lfs to later in the section .",
    "we derive the shape of the lcy lf using the cluster data themselves .",
    "the derivation of the lf for this sample of clusters is described in detail in lc97 , lpez - cruz et al .",

    ", lpez - cruz & yee 1999 ) shows that the sample has @xmath46 , where the uncertainty is the dispersion of the distribution . however , cd clusters appear to have a larger range of @xmath47 which is apparently correlated with richness ( lc97 , lpez - cruz & yee 1999 ) . removing the cd clusters produces a @xmath48 .",
    "we adopt an `` universal '' lf for the clusters with @xmath49 ( at a median redshift of 0.07 ) and @xmath45 .    for deriving richness measurements for clusters at significant redshifts ,",
    "the evolution of galaxies comes into play .",
    "counting galaxies to a fixed absolute magnitude will in general over estimate the richness for high redshift clusters , as even mild passive evolution will mean effectively counting deeper into the lf . hence , following yg87 , we add a mild luminosity evolutionary term parametrized as @xmath50 mag , where @xmath51 , to @xmath47 to compensate for this effect .",
    "( yg87 used a second order polynominal for @xmath47 evolution , we have simplified this to a single term in @xmath5 , since any such measurement is currently extremely approximate . ) there is good evidence that the lf in clusters evolves , to first order , in such a manner from galaxies associated with quasars ( yg87 ) , and from the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey ( yee et al .",

    "1998 ) , we also compare  values using the field galaxy ke lf with its separate components for different morphological types .",
    "the ke lf was derived as a preliminary result using a small number of low - redshift galaxies from the aat / durham redshift survey . here",
    ", the @xmath47 values are transformed into the cousin @xmath17 band from the gunn @xmath53 band as listed in yg87 .",
    "the same luminosity evolution as that for the lcy lf is incorporated into the ke lf .",
    "the final lf used is the interim lf derived from the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey ( yee et al .",
    "1997 , lin et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the lf is determined based on about 2300 galaxies with redshifts between 0.1 and 0.55 , covering two patches on the sky .",
    "the galaxies are separated into early , intermediate , and late spectral types based on 5-color photometry .",
    "the lf for each component is then fitted to a schechter function with two evolution parameters , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in the form of @xmath56 ( see lin et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "hence , the evolution of this lf is derived explicitly with @xmath55 measuring the luminosity evolution , and @xmath54 , the density evolution ( see table 2 ) .",
    "an important parameter in the lf for the determination of  is the normalization constant @xmath57 .",
    "the value of  is inversely proportional to it . as discussed in yg87 , the best way to minimize systematic effects in",
    "is to determine a self - consistent lf with a normalization constant that reproduces the background counts as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "we hence renormalized @xmath57 by multiplying it by @xmath58 which is determined by fitting the modeled counts to the background counts .",
    "we determine @xmath57 for the lcy lf directly by minimizing the @xmath59 between model counts generated by using the lf and the background count data . for the ke and cnoc2 lfs , the relative @xmath57 s for each component",
    "are retained , but an overall normalization is applied based on the background count fitting .",
    "we found that the renormalization of the cnoc2 lf , which is derived using the same photometry band , is small , less than 10% .",
    "the modeled counts for the various lfs are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the  values obtained using the lcy lf are listed in table 1 .",
    "the values obtained using the other two lfs are similar , with variations of less than @xmath810% .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the dependence of  on the lf is left to section 4.1 . for each cluster , we count galaxies down to a limit of @xmath60 in a circle of 0.5 mpc radius nominally using the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) as the center of the cluster . however , we note that a few clusters have their bcg not sitting in the obvious center of the distribution of galaxies .",
    "the most significant deviation occurs in a168 , where the bcg is almost isolated from the cluster . in this case",
    ", we have chosen the brightest galaxy in the high density clump ( with the correct color ) to be the center of the cluster . choosing the bcg as the center for a168 would produce a  almost 3 times smaller .",
    "the uncertainty for the  parameter is computed using the formula :    @xmath61    where @xmath31 is the net counts of galaxies over the background of @xmath34 .",
    "this is a conservatively large error estimate as it includes the expected counting statistics in @xmath31 and the expected dispersion in background counts .",
    "the factor @xmath62 is included to account approximately for the additional fluctuation from the clustered ( and hence non - poissonian ) nature of the background counts ( see lc97 and yg87 ) .",
    "this is a fair estimate of the uncertainty of the richness of the cluster , as it includes the poissonian uncertainty in the net counts , which is equivalent to the uncertainty in the number of galaxies drawn from a schechter function with a fixed normalization ( hence of fixed richness ) .",
    "however , we note that the inverse of this error estimate is an underestimate of the statistical significance of the excess galaxy counts in the sample , which would be better represented by @xmath63 . hence , at these low redshifts , while the average uncertainty in the  parameter is about 25% , the significance of the excess counts over background is considerably better at about the 20@xmath64 level .",
    "in this section , we examine the results of exhaustive tests on the dependence of  on various quantities , such as the lf shape and parameters , sampling and spatial limits , and photometric errors .",
    "these tests not only provide a clear indication of the robustness of the  parameter , but also the pitfalls in applying the method .      a richness measurement based on the number of galaxies in a cluster is invariably tied to the assumption of the luminosity function of the galaxies .",
    "if clusters have greatly different galaxy lfs , then any such richness measurement would be rendered meaningless . in this section ,",
    "we test the sensitivity of  to the lf used in converting @xmath30 to @xmath65 . for these tests",
    "we vary the lf parameters but fix the sampling limit at @xmath60 mag .",
    "this sampling limit was chosen with the expectation that it minimizes the effect of having an incorrect lf .",
    "varying the lf with different sampling limits causes more complex behaviors ; these effects are tested in  4.2 .",
    "we have computed  using three lfs derived using very different data and method .",
    "the lcy lf is based on the cluster lf measured from the same set of data , and describes cluster galaxies the best ; while the ke and cnoc2 lf are based on field galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "the three give remarkably similar results with the mean of the ratio of ( lcy):(cnoc2):(ke ) being 1.00:1.10:0.92 , with the mean value for ( lcy ) being 1246@xmath66417 , where the uncertainty is the dispersion of the  values in the sample .",
    "this result demonstrates that the systematic uncertainty arising from the not - strictly - correct assumption of a `` universal '' lf for both cluster and field galaxies is of the order of 10% .",
    "the ratios indicate that the cnoc2 lf is slightly fainter overall compared to the lcy lf , while the ke lf is somewhat brighter .",
    "this indeed is the case when comparing the @xmath47 s of early type galaxies in the two multi - component lfs with that of the lcy lf .    for the remainder of the paper",
    ", we will use the  values derived using the lcy lf as the fiducial set , and compare the results from the various tests to it .",
    "first , we test the effect of an `` universal '' lf with incorrect parameters . in varying the @xmath47 and @xmath67 of the lf",
    ", we also adjust the normalization constant of the lf , so that it reproduces the control field galaxy counts up to the magnitude of sampling . note",
    "that this is an important step to make sure that the s are obtained with a self - consistent lf model .",
    "this is different from testing the effects of statistical fluctuations of the lf of individual clusters from the mean for which one would not perform the renormalization ( see  4.1.3 ) .    in these tests",
    "we first adjust the lcy lf by altering @xmath47 in steps of @xmath660.25 mag .",
    "each time we recompute the normalization constant for the lf by fitting the background counts .",
    "we note that the fit to the background counts deteriorates with each step , but remains reasonable up to a @xmath68 of @xmath660.5 mag .",
    "the results are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the results for @xmath47 being off by @xmath660.25 mag are quite acceptable , causing variations of about 10% , similar to the effects of using the three different lfs .",
    "this is not surprising , as the uncertainties in the three lfs are of the same order .",
    "even when the error is 0.5 mag , the effect is about 20% , comparable to about 1/2 an abell richness class ( equivalent to @xmath69 of about 200 ; see section 5 ) .",
    "we next alter the faint - end slope @xmath67 of the lf , again , with renormalization based on fitting the background . here",
    ", we change @xmath67 by steps of 0.15 .",
    "the results are tabulated in table 4 .",
    "again , one sees that changing the slope by as much as @xmath70 alters the  values by less than 20% .",
    "these tests , along with the results from using three different lfs , demonstrate that a lf which self - consistently reproduces the background counts can be substantially incorrect and still produces results that are accurate to better than 1/2 an abell class .      in this section ,",
    "we test the effect of statistical fluctuations from the mean in the lf of the cluster galaxies . here , we vary @xmath71 and @xmath67 , but do not adjust the normalization constant of the lf .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath71 , it has the same effect as a photometric error of the same magnitude in the cluster data .",
    "we use the same step sizes for @xmath38 and @xmath67 as in  4.1.2 , and the results are listed in tables 3 and 4 . here , we see that the effects are significantly larger .",
    "specifically , a fluctuation in @xmath47 ( or equivalently , photometric error in the data ) of about 0.4 mag will produce a 20% ( 1/2 abell class ) effect .",
    "however , a fluctuation of 0.2 mag would still be quite acceptable , producing uncertainties of only about 10% .",
    "since cluster @xmath47 s have a dispersion of about 0.2 mag , this indicates that the instrinsic dispersion of the lf from cluster to cluster does not affect  significantly .",
    "similar fluctuations due to variations in @xmath67  of up to 0.3 are also seen .",
    "the independence of  values on galaxy counting limiting magnitude is an important issue , especially when different fields are observed to different depths .",
    "if the correct lf is chosen for the computation of  and the lf is truly universal , then  should subject only to counting statistical variations when different limiting magnitudes are used . a substantial systematic variation in  with limiting magnitude",
    "can be taken as an indication that a lf with the incorrect shape has been chosen .",
    "moreover , for the purpose of producing robust results , there is an optimal range of absolute magnitudes for galaxy counting .",
    "counting to too bright a limit will produce a large uncertainty from counting statistics .",
    "furthermore , one is at the mercy of small intrinsic variations of @xmath47 in individual clusters , or equivalently , small photometric zero point error in the galaxy photometry .    on the other hand",
    ", a larger uncertainty may also result from counting too deep into the lf , as the background counts rise more rapidly than the flat part of the cluster lf .",
    "in addition , in counting beyond @xmath72 one may encounter large variations in the faint end slopes of the cluster lf ( lpez - cruz et al .",
    "1997 and lcy ) , producing additional fluctuations . ideally , one would like the richness parameter of a galaxy cluster to be representative of the total mass of the cluster , which , under the light - traces - mass scenario ( e.g. , tyson & fischer 1996 ; carlberg , yee , & ellingson 1997 ) , should be proportional to the total light .",
    "hence , the richness of a cluster is best represented by the number of @xmath73-like galaxies , rather than by the number of dwarf galaxies ; consequently , a robust measure of  is best obtained using a magnitude limit corresponding to the flat part of the lf : from about 1 mag to 3 mag past @xmath47 .",
    "the data in our sample of abell clusters sample to at least @xmath74 mag for all the clusters ; hence , they provide a good test on the robustness of  versus counting magnitude , and the effects of varying the lf . for these tests , we compute the  parameters using @xmath75 , 21.0 , -20.0 , 19.0 , and 18.0 for comparison with the standard limit of 20 ( i.e. , about 2 mag past @xmath47 ) . the five derivations provide ratios of average  of : 1.04:1.05:1.00:1.00:1.07 .",
    "a comparison of the individual s using sampling limits of 21.0 and 20.00 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this test shows very strongly that , as expected , when a lf closely resembling that of the cluster galaxy lf is used , the sampling magnitude limit has little or no systematic effect on the derived richness .",
    "the variations in individual  values are the order of the computed uncertainties , and are due to counting statistics .",
    "we note that the largest deviation occurs with the deepest sampling limit .",
    "this is expected as the steepening of the galaxy lf for some clusters begins at about @xmath76 , which would produce a larger count relative to the flat ( @xmath77 ) lf used .",
    "next , we consider the effects of the combination of lf variations and more extreme sampling limits .",
    "we focus on testing the effect of incorrect lf and photometric errors when sampling to only about @xmath47 , a situation that may arise often when data which are not quite deep enough are pressed into use .",
    "the results are shown in table 3 . in general , at a sampling limit of @xmath78 mag ( about @xmath47 ) , the errors committed when @xmath47 is varied with renormalization of the lf ( equivalent to using an incorrect lf ) are about twice as large as those when the sampling is to @xmath82 mag past @xmath47 ( about 20 mag ) . however",
    ", when no renormalization is performed , which is also equivalent to photometric uncertainty , the errors incurred when counting to 22 mag can be as large as 4 times those to 20 mag .",
    "for example , a + 0.5 mag change in @xmath47 produces  values 2.2 times larger when counting to 22 mag , compared to 1.3 times larger when counting is done to 20 mag .",
    "we note that the results for changing @xmath67 are not nearly as drastic , as that affects mainly the faint end of the lf ( see table 4 ) .",
    "we hence conclude that counting to about @xmath47 produces results that are extremely sensitive to errors in the assumed lf , photometry , and in general statistical fluctuation , with results that could be off by a factor of 1.5 to over 2 when the error in magnitude is 0.25 to 0.5 mag .",
    "this may explain the large discrepancies noted in the  values of bl lac objects between smith , odea , & baum ( 1995 ) and wurtz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , as noted by wurtz et al .. we also note that this may also be the possible explanation of the discrepancies of between the richness derived for abell clusters by andersen & owen ( 1994 ) and this work ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "ideally , a robust richness parameter is one such that the counting area used should not have a significant effect on the richness derived .",
    "such a parameter would allow comparison of the richness parameter from data taken with a wide variety of areal coverage .",
    "this is strictly possible only if the spatial distribution function of cluster galaxies has a similar form for all clusters .",
    "if an incorrect slope ( @xmath32 ) for the correlation function is used , the  value will be dependent on the sampling area . in the computation of  it",
    "is assumed that the galaxy distribution drops off in the same fashion as the spatial correlation function for field galaxies .",
    "this assumption is adopted so that comparisons over a wide range of richness and environments , including that of field galaxies , can be made .",
    "however , this assumption is most likely incorrect for rich clusters , as various investigations have shown that the power - law slope of their galaxy density distribution is probably greater than 2 ( e.g. , lilje & efstathiou 1988 , pebbles 1993 ) , somewhat steeper than that of the clustering of field galaxies .",
    "the effect of using an inexact @xmath32 can be examined by comparing the  values for our sample using different limiting radii .",
    "we have computed  values ( with the lcy lf ) using sampling radii of 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 mpc , all with a @xmath79 sampling limit of 20 mag .",
    "the ratio of the mean s for the 3 radii are : 1.03:1.00:0.94 .",
    "the results for individual clusters with sampling radii of 0.5 and 1.0 mpc are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the results indicate that a change of a factor of 2 in the sampling radius causes a scattering of about 5% in the richness parameter .",
    "this small effect is reassuring , and provides confidence when comparing data sampled over metric field sizes of a factor of several , as in those used by de robertis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "the decreasing trend in the  with larger radii is consistent with existing evidence that cluster galaxy distribution is likely to be steeper than the slope of the field galaxy correlation function .",
    "however , since the effect is very small , we have chosen to retain the canonical @xmath80 so that direct comparisons with field and group clustering amplitudes can be made .",
    "the various tests in section 4 have established the robustness of the  parameter as a measure of cluster richness . in this section ,",
    "we compare the  parameter with the abell richness class , establishing a calibration between the two .",
    "we also discuss the correlation between  and the abell count number , which allows us to examine the accuracy of the abell count number as a measure of richness . based on these comparisons",
    ", we suggest a revised richness classification scheme based on the calibration between the  parameter and arc .",
    "finally , we illustrate the advantage of using a robust richness parameter in the investigation of cluster properties by examining the correlation between richness and velocity dispersion .",
    "one of the main goal of this investigation is to establish a calibration between a more quantitative richness parameter , such as , and the traditional abell richness class . in figure 4 , we plot the  parameters versus arc .",
    "we see in general a very broad correlation between  and arc .",
    "we note that because we have specifically chosen to image arc 0 clusters which appear to be the richest , they should not be considered in the correlation .",
    "andersen & owen ( 1994 ) produced a qualitatively very similar plot of the two quantities using a different sample and very different type of data .",
    "however , quantitatively , there is a significant discrepancy in the scaling of the two quantities : their  values are close to a factor of two lower than ours ( after correcting for @xmath81 ) , with their average  for arc 1 clusters being @xmath82 mpc@xmath83 , compared to about 1000 mpc@xmath83 in our work .",
    "this discrepancy is perhaps not surprising , given that : ( 1 ) andersen & owen use poss photographic data which may not be well calibrated , ( 2 ) their object counting goes down to only @xmath84 , and ( 3 ) they did not use a lf that has been renormalized to the background .",
    "all these can contribute substantially to the systematic uncertainty , up to a factor of 2 , as demonstrated by our tests in  4 .",
    "since the arc is an approximate and quantized measure , we will next look at the comparison with actual abell counts ( @xmath0 ) before revisiting the correlation between  and arc in  5.3 .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the arc and the  measurement can be obtained by using the abell number counts ( @xmath0 ) as published by aco .",
    "we plot @xmath0 vs  in figure 5 . taken as a whole ,",
    "again we see a definite correlation between  and @xmath0 but with a large dispersion .",
    "specifically , it is noted that at large @xmath0 the correlation breaks down in that their corresponding  values are smaller than indicated by @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that all the clusters in our sample with large @xmath0s are those at higher redshifts .",
    "we hence break the sample into two groups , dividing them at @xmath85 . to increase the @xmath86 sample",
    ", we also add 3 clusters from the cnoc1 survey ( yee et al .",
    "1999 ) which are abell clusters at @xmath87 .",
    "these are a2390 , ms0451 + 02 ( a520 ) , and ms0906 + 11 ( a750 ) .",
    "removing the high redshift sample provides a much improved correlation bewteen  and @xmath0 .",
    "for the lower @xmath5 sample , though the scatter is about one abell class , there are few or no outliers . for the higher @xmath5 sample ,",
    "there is almost no correlation between  and @xmath0 .",
    "the discrepancies come entirely in the high @xmath0 clusters which all have too large a @xmath0 for their .",
    "it is interesting to note that a665 , which is the only abell cluster classified as arc 5 , with @xmath88 , has a  value which indicates that its richness is overestimated by a factor of 3 by @xmath0 .",
    "a number of abell clusters in fact have similar richness to a665 , including a2390 and a401 .",
    "hence , we conclude that at @xmath1 , the aco counts provide reasonable estimates of the richness of the clusters ; however , at @xmath2 , and/or for @xmath89 , the @xmath0 counts almost always over predict the cluster s richness .",
    "this is not a surprising result , as many authors have concluded that the abell catalog becomes incomplete at @xmath2 ( e.g. , southerland 1988 ; struble & rood 1991b ) .      using figures 4 or 5",
    ", we can relate the more robust  measurements directly to the abell richness class , in essence , calibrating the classical richness class designations .",
    "the mediam  value of arc 1 clusters in our sample is very close to 1000 17 .",
    "hence , we propose to use 1000 17  as the fiducial  value for the average arc 1 counts .",
    "abell ( 1958 ) and aco used a non - linear relationship between the abell counts and the richness class with the higher arc having disproportionately higher counts , presumably to account for the few apparently very high @xmath0 clusters .",
    "however ,  5.2 demonstrates that the very high @xmath0 clusters are probably much less rich .",
    "if we scale the  values corresponding to each arc counts using the fiducial of 1000 17  as arc 1 , we see that there is a significant mismatch at arc@xmath33 , as illustrated by the dotted line in figure 4 , with arc 5 being equivalent to @xmath90 .",
    "yee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also found that none of the 16 clusters from the cnoc1 survey , which contains the most x - ray luminous clusters from the emss survey ( see gioia & luppino 1994 ) , have  larger than @xmath91 mpc @xmath83 .",
    "hence , there appears to be no known clusters that approach the original definition of arc 5 . in view of this",
    ", we propose a linear richness scale where adjacent richness classes change by the same increment of 400 17  in .",
    "this scale would cover most of the range of known cluster richness ( including very rich , x - ray luminous , higher redshift clusters , such as those in the cnoc1 sample ) , with the first 3 classes ( 0 , 1 , and 2 ) matching the original arc definition reasonably well .",
    "this revised classification definition is shown graphically in figure 4 . for @xmath6",
    "km s@xmath7 mpc @xmath7 , the calibration for arc 0 to 5 is then : 600@xmath66200 , 1000@xmath66200 , 1400@xmath66200 , 1800@xmath66200 , 2200@xmath66200 , and @xmath92 17 , respectively .",
    "we note that this calibration is substantially different from those provided by prestage & peacock ( 1988 ) based on a very small number of 4c radio galaxies situated in abell clusters .",
    "their calibration of arc 0 and 1 having  of @xmath8380 and 850 17  is about 1/3 to 1/2 of an abell class too high .",
    "hence , previous descriptions of the abell class equivalence for the environments of radio galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , yg87 ) need to be revised correspondingly downward .",
    "so far we have shown that a richness parameter such as , which uses photometric data and normalized by the lf and spatial distribution of galaxies , produces a robust measurement of the richness of a cluster .",
    "one would then expect that such a robust parameter will provide a better description of the clusters , and hence produce more meaningful correlations with other cluster properties .",
    "we will show , as a demonstration of the improvement expected , an example of such a correlation .",
    "one fundamental cluster property is the mass of a cluster , which can be estimated by the velocity dispersion ( @xmath64 ) . in figure 6",
    "we plot the correlation of @xmath64 versus .",
    "the velocity dispersion measurements are taken from the compilation of struble & rood ( 1991a ) , and fadda et al .",
    "we include only those clusters with 10 or more velocity measurements .",
    "there is a clear correlation between @xmath64 and , and the correlation is much tighter than using @xmath0 as the variable for richness which is shown in figure 7 .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed a similar improvement in the correlation between velocity dispersion and richness when bahcall s ( 1981 ) @xmath9 parameter is used instead of the abell counts .",
    "this improved correlation lends support that  is a more robust richness measurement .",
    "the @xmath64-  correlation derived from the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey ( yee et al .",
    "1999 ) provides an even tighter correlation between the two quantities .",
    "this is almost certainly due to the fact that the velocity dispersion measurements from cnoc1 are derived from a homogeneous set of velocity data with a large number of velocities for each cluster .",
    "we note that the @xmath64-  relationships derived from the two different samples ( this work and cnoc1 ) are identical within the uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath64  relationship from cnoc1 is plotted as a dotted line in figure 6 .",
    "given the different photometric systems used ( kron - cousin @xmath17 vs gunn @xmath53 ) , the different redshift range of the sample , and the different instrumentations used for these two samples , this again points to the robustness of the  measurements as a richness estimator .",
    "we have used a sample of 47 abell clusters with photometric catalogs from ccd images to test the robustness of  as a parameter for measuring the richness of galaxy clusters .",
    "we first tested the effect of the choice of galaxy lf , which is used to normalize the excess galaxy counts . using three lfs derived from different sources , including both cluster and field galaxies",
    ", we found that as long as we adjust the density normalization constant of the lf so that it reproduces the background counts used to derive the excess counts , different choices of the lf produce variations in  of approximately 10% .",
    "furthermore , the parameters for the lf can be substantially incorrect ( e.g. , with @xmath47 being off by 0.5 mag ) , errors in  can also be minimized by renormalizing the lf to fit the background counts .",
    "we also found that if a correct lf is used , counting to different absolute magnitude limits produces systematic variations of only a few percent",
    ". however , to minimize uncertainties introduced by lf discrepancy and photometry errors , the results are most reliable when the counting is done to about 1 to 2 mag past @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , the canonical @xmath80 for the spatial correlation function of field galaxies provides reasonably stable  values as one varies the radius of the counting aperture . altering the counting radius from 0.25 to 1.5",
    "mpc produces systematic changes in  of less than 10% .",
    "we have compared our  richness parameters with the abell richness class and the abell count number ( @xmath0 ) . limiting the sample to either arc@xmath932 or @xmath1",
    ", we found a good correlation between @xmath0 and .",
    "however , clusters designated as arc@xmath33 appear often to have their richness over estimated , sometimes by as much as a factor of 3 .",
    "since most of the arc@xmath33 clusters are at @xmath10 , this suggests that arc classifications for clusters with @xmath2 is not a good indicator of their true richness .",
    "we suggest a revised richness classification which is based on a linear scale in .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the improvement in the correlation between richness and velocity dispersion when a robust richness parameter , like , is used .",
