    "deeply virtual exclusive pseudoscalar meson production can be described within qcd factorization , through the convolution of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) and hard scattering amplitudes ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . although a full proof of factorization theorems was given only for longitudinal photon polarization @xcite , in a series of papers @xcite we showed that transverse photon polarization amplitudes can give substantial contributions even if they appear at the next to leading twist through the @xmath0 coupling @xmath2 , in the @xmath3 reaction . because of the @xmath4 coupling , the transverse polarization amplitudes contain convolutions of the four chiral - odd gpds namely , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the chiral odd gpds acquire a specific physical meaning , allowing us to explore different transverse spin configurations in the proton , when written in terms of the quark - proton transversity amplitudes , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the spin component along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "sensible information is obtained when the gpds are proportional to linear combinations of amplitudes that are diagonal in a given basis , meaning that the spin projections are the same on the lhs and rhs of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this allows us to associate each gpd with parton distribution functions carrying the same spin information , bearing in mind that even if a connection between spin configurations is established , gpds are related to amplitudes _ i.e_. they are not probabilities in momentum space ( the quarks carry different momenta on the lhs and on the rhs of fig.[fig1 ] ) . the connection between gpds , transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) both through their common ",
    "parent \" distributions , the generalized tmds ( gtmds ) has been explored in @xcite , and in transverse coordinate space by burkardt @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can see that @xmath9 is the off forward generalization of the proton s transversity structure functions , @xmath10 , or the probability of finding a transversely polarized quark inside a transversely polarized proton .",

    "crossed diagrams are not shown in the figure . ]",
    "@xmath10 and its integral over @xmath12 , the tensor charge , @xmath13 , have notoriously been elusive quantities to extract from experiment .",
    "being chirally odd , @xmath10 can be measured in either semi inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) or in the drell yan process in conjunction with another chiral odd partner .",
    "the tensor charge s flavor dependence was obtained only relatively recently from model dependent analyses of sidis single hadron and dihadron production processes in the few gev region , and for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the combination @xmath15 has a helicity structure similar to one for the boer mulders function @xmath16 @xcite , the transversely polarized quark distribution in an unpolarized proton .",
    "although one can show that the two distributions are generated from the same gtmd @xcite , they have an important phase difference . as a result",

    "involves a double spin flip and its contribution therefore also vanishes in the forward limit .",
    "this gpd emerges as the difference between the canonical transversity non - flip amplitudes ( @xmath19 ) , and the planar transversity non - flip amplitudes ( @xmath20 ) . since in the forward direction",
    "there is no distinction between canonical transversity and planar transversity , clearly then , this gpd requires non - forward scattering to be non - zero .",
    "the target polarized transversely at an azimuthal angle different from zero or @xmath21 will allow this double correlation to be probed .    finally , @xmath22 is the most elusive of the chiral odd gpds since because of parity and time reversal constraints it vanishes for the skewness parameter @xmath23 , and it is therefore zero in the forward limit ; its first moment in @xmath24 is also zero @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 can therefore be considered an entirely off - forward product .",
    "@xmath25 describes a transversely polarized quark ( along the @xmath24 axis ) in a longitudinally polarized proton .",
    "it is t - even and directly connected to the first moment of the tmd @xmath26 .",
    "our interest in @xmath22 stems from the fact that it manifests a similar spin structure to the chiral - even twist three gpd , @xmath27 , that was shown to enter the sum rule component for partonic orbital angular momentum ( oam ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "correlated , although indirect information on oam therefore can be obtained from both @xmath22 and @xmath26 measurements .",
    "in ref.@xcite we evaluated the contributions of the various chiral odd gpds to the observables in exclusive deeply virtual @xmath0 electro - production ( dv@xmath0p ) recently measured at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "in particular , there exist measurements for the various unpolarized scattering components , for the beam spin asymmetry @xmath28 , and for the target spin asymmetries for longitudinal polarization , @xmath29 ( unpolarized beam ) and @xmath30 ( polarized beam ) .",
    "our analysis uses a flexible parametrization which is based on the reggeized diquark model , that is a spectator model with variable mass of the spectator , @xmath31 , which reproduces the regge behavior in the low @xmath24 , large @xmath31 limit @xcite .",
    "the presence of scalar and axial - vector diquarks allows us to model the @xmath32 and @xmath33 quark distributions separately , _ i.e. _ distinguishing between the different isospin projections , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as it follows from the use of su(4 ) symmetry in the nucleon .",
    "the model s parameters were determined from quantitative fits of the chiral even gpds using a compilation of : _",
    "i ) _ flavor separated dirac and pauli nucleon form factor data @xcite , and axial @xcite and pseudo - scalar @xcite form factor data ; _ ii ) _ dvcs data @xcite ; and _ iii ) _ reproducing the forward limit of gpds for both the unpolarized and polarized parton distribution functions from dis data . for the latter we evolved the model from its initial low scale to the scale of the data using leading order perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) gpd evolution equations ( see _",
    "e.g. _ refs.@xcite ) .    for the various asymmetries , in particular , we predicted that the spin modulations which are ideal for measuring chiral odd gpds using a longitudinally polarized target are @xmath36 , and the constant in @xmath37 term , @xmath30 .",
    "the latter are , in fact , proportional to transverse polarization terms only , and therefore they involve only chiral odd gpds .",
    "the other modulations , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , contain contributions from both longitudinal and transverse photons , their description will always contain a mixture of chiral odd and chiral even gpds , and thus , they are not most appropriate for a clean extraction of the chiral odd sector . using our model",
    ", we found that the dominant contribution to these asymmetries was coming from the chiral even sector ( even in the low @xmath40 kinematical range of jefferson lab ) .",
    "an additional , important observation is that most of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 data are sensitive to @xmath18 , @xmath41 , and @xmath22 , but not directly to @xmath9 , and they are therefore not suitable for extracting the tensor charge .    in this paper",
    "we show that the availability of a transversely polarized target and of combined @xmath1 and @xmath0 exclusive electroproduction data are both crucial to extract the tensor charge and its flavor dependence . the extraction from exclusive measurements can in principle",
    "allow us to pin down this quantity more precisely than from sidis analyses , an extra advantage being that , as we will explain in what follows , the low @xmath24 dependence of transversity which dominates the integration giving @xmath42 , @xmath43 , will be constrained in exclusive measurements through the @xmath44 behavior of the compton form factors ( cffs ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] we review our approach , and we outline the derivation of the helicity amplitudes entering the cross section for deeply virtual pseudoscalar meson production ; in section [ sec:3 ] we present our results for the various observables and estimate the possibility of extraction of the tensor charge from deeply virtual exclusive experiments ; in section [ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we summarize , in what follows , the formal steps that lead us to parametrize polarized exclusive pseudoscalar meson electroproduction in terms of chiral - odd gpds .",

    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first of all , the tensor charge is subject to a rather rapid perturbative qcd evolution ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as can be seen from the shift ( decrease ) in values from @xmath40=1 gev@xmath195 to @xmath40= 4 gev@xmath195 shown for our extracted values ( all the other evaluations shown in the figure are in the @xmath40 range : @xmath283 gev@xmath195 )",
    ".     plotted vs. @xmath24 at @xmath40= 1 gev@xmath195 , for the @xmath32 quarks ( upper panel ) and for the @xmath33 quark ( lower panel ) . besides our analysis ,",
    "the most recent extractions from experimental data were plotted , namely the analysis of the pavia group extraction @xcite obtained from dihadron production in a collinear framework , and the torino group extraction @xcite obtained combining data on polarized sidis single hadron production @xcite , and data on dihadron production from @xmath274 annihilation @xcite ( see the corresponding tensor charge values in fig.[delu_vs_deld : fig]).,width=321 ]    most importantly , the graph shows how the low @xmath24 tail of the transversity distribution plays a fundamental role in determining the value of the charge .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the values obtained for the @xmath32 quarks ( @xmath33 quarks values tend to be smaller and the effects are less visible ) .",
    "in fact the values from ref.@xcite were obtained by calculating the charge in the @xmath12 range of the fitted data ( @xmath14 ) , and by extrapolating to @xmath284 ( open symbol ) .",
    "the extrapolated result tends to agree better with our extraction .",
    "note that our parametrization explicitly includes regge behavior , therefore our value of the charge tends to be larger . our regge behavior , in turn ,",
    "is constrained by the nucleon s form factors behavior @xcite .",
    "this is why measuring the tensor charge through gpds provides a definite advantage over all of the inclusive measurements where extrapolation procedures in the low @xmath24 regime need to be devised .    in figure [ aut_tensor ]",
    "we demonstrate the sensitivity of pseudoscalar meson production data to the values of the tensor charge . for illustration",
    ", we show only the @xmath0 asymmetry , and we fix @xmath285 .",
    "the figure shows curves for varying @xmath278 in the range @xmath286 , whereas the error band was obtained by varying the tensor charge by @xmath279 .",
    "additional information on @xmath277 can be obtained by comparing @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements .",
    "the purpose of the calculations represented in this figure is to gain information on the kind of precision that will be needed in order to reduce the error on the tensor charge with respect to the values from the analyses reported in fig.[delu_vs_deld : fig ] . from the figure",
    "we conclude that an accurate extraction of tensor charge and its flavor dependence will be possible at jefferson lab , 12 gev @xcite .",
    "the various transversity distributions mentioned in our discussion above are shown in figure [ transv : fig ] .",
    "these curves show that the tensor charge for the u - quark will be larger than the results from the two other analyses , while the d - quark tensor charge will be smaller , again showing the importance of the small @xmath24 behavior in our reggeized scheme .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the gpd @xmath22 enters the transverse non flip amplitudes , @xmath287 and it can therefore be extracted once more accurate data are available .",
    "we postpone the discussion of this observable to future work .",
    "in conclusion , we reiterate that transverse asymmetries allow us to single out the tensor charge best .",
    "namely , the asymmetries are sensitive to the gpd @xmath9 , in contrast to the longitudinal target polarization asymmetries reported in detail in ref.@xcite that are mostly sensitive to the gpds @xmath18 , @xmath41 , and @xmath22 , and to the integral of @xmath288 + @xmath41 , or the tensor anomalous magnetic moment . a combined analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 data will allow us to perform a flavor separation of both the tensor charges and the tensor anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that although the agreement of the tensor charge values reported in this paper with the very precise recent lattice results is excellent , in our analysis the tensor charge was obtained indirectly , by using constraints from parity relations that allow us to connect to the somewhat better constrained gpds in the chiral even sector .",
    "the extraction we proposed can therefore be considered model dependent .",
    "nevertheless , at this stage our study provides , on one side , a set of very much needed estimates and constraints on the size of the various , so far largely unexplored , chiral odd gpds . on the other side",
    ", it opens the way to an upcoming analysis that will be performed by fitting our functional forms directly to the combined exclusive @xmath1 and @xmath0 electroproduction data , once these will be made available .",
    "our ultimate goal is to determine the chiral odd gpds from a global analysis on its own merit , using all of the pseudoscalar meson production data .",
    "hence , this paper can be considered to be a step in this direction in that it provides a framework with which to gauge the various contributions to all cross sections and asymmetries .",
    "most importantly , the suggested analysis will allow us to substantially reduce the errors on the flavor dependent @xmath42 , and to perform , for the first time , an experimental extraction of @xmath260 .",
