    "while studying a continuum of identical oscillators on a ring with nonlocal coupling , kuramoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discovered a remarkable state where the population of oscillators splits into two subpopulations , where one is synchronized and the other is desynchronized , known as a _",
    "chimera state_. since then several groups have explored the nonlinear dynamics of chimeras .",
    "@xcite their emergence on the ring was first analyzed by abrams and strogatz ,  @xcite who found that chimera states are born through a saddle node bifurcation .",
    "the state exists in systems with various network structures ; for instance , shima and kuramoto  @xcite showed that chimeras also exist on 2d lattices with free boundaries in the shape of spiral waves .",
    "other authors have been studying its appearance on variations of the kuramoto model such as systems with delayed coupling .",
    "@xcite    while various aspects about the emergence of chimeras have been addressed , the question of how the underlying network structure affects their existence has not been addressed systematically .",
    "we make a first step in this direction by studying a network of three oscillator populations with nonlocal coupling .",
    "a network with three nodes may either be arranged as a triangle or as a chain , and therefore represents the simplest case of a discrete network with ring - like or chain - like character , respectively ; the network structure will be determined by the nature of the coupling , as we explain later .",
    "the case of the triangular network has already been discussed in a previous study  @xcite where the author shows that two stable chimera states may coexist . in this study",
    ", we shall introduce a new parameter that allows us to break the rotational invariance inherent to the triangle and to vary the network structure continuously such that it becomes more and more chain - like . thereby we seek to find parameter limits for the existence of chimera states .",
    "we consider the case of infinitely many oscillators .",
    "this case is often considered a valid approximation , and using a recently developed method by ott and antonsen ,  @xcite it enables us to reduce this infinitely dimensional problem to a set of a finite ordinary differential equations .  @xcite    the article is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide the definition of the system under investigation and explain how we intend to vary the character of the network structure by introduction of a special parameter .",
    "we then state the equations resulting from applying the ott - antonsen method and consider special symmetries that allow for chimeras .",
    "the analysis of the chimera states and their bifurcation scenarios follows in section  [ sec : analysis2 ] , where we analyze how the chimera states cease to exist as we vary the network structure using the above mentioned parameter .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion2 ] summarizes our findings .",
    "the governing equations are given by @xmath0 where the phases of the oscillators are defined by @xmath1 ; @xmath2 denotes the individual oscillators belonging to the population with index @xmath3 , each of which has @xmath4 oscillators ; parameter @xmath5 changes the character of the phase attraction .",
    "the coupling kernel @xmath6 describes the coupling strength between populations @xmath7 and @xmath8 and is assumed to decay with increasing separation between the populations on the network . within a population , the oscillators interact with strength @xmath9 .",
    "neighboring populations couple more weakly , with strength @xmath10 or @xmath11 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] .",
    "we then have @xmath12        in the case where @xmath13 we retrieve the case of a globally coupled network .",
    "thus @xmath14 may be thought of how far we are away from global coupling .",
    "the introduction of the parameter @xmath15 in ( [ eq : kernel2 ] ) generalizes our previous work  @xcite : for @xmath16 , one obtains the case of a triangular network with the same rotational symmetry as a continuum of oscillators on a ring , studied by .",
    "@xcite if we let @xmath17 this rotational symmetry is broken ; in particular , for @xmath18 , the left and right populations interact less strongly with one another than they interact with what turns out to be the center population ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : networks ] ( iii ) ) . hence parameter @xmath15 controls what one may conceive as the distance between the outer left and right population .",
    "thus for @xmath18 , the network attains a chain - like character . to facilitate comparison with earlier work , we focus on positive coupling only and impose the constraints @xmath19 our special interest lies in the case where @xmath18 because of its close relation to chain - like structures .",
    "however , we relax this constraint during the subsequent analysis in favor of a deeper understanding of the bifurcation structure .",
    "we summarize how we obtain a reduced set of governing equations based on the ott - antonsen method  @xcite . in order to analyze the behavior of ( [ eq : goveqns2 ] )",
    ", we consider the limit of infinitely large populations , i.e. @xmath20 . in this limit",
    ", one may describe the dynamics in terms of the oscillator density distribution @xmath21 , which evolves according to the continuity equation @xmath22 the velocity of the oscillators in this limit is given by @xmath23 and a complex order parameter is introduced , @xmath24 defining an average over all oscillator phases ; it is therefore referred to as _ weighted or global order parameter_. in this formulation of the problem , we are able reduce the problem to a finite set of equations using a method recently developed by ott and antonsen .",

    "the application of this ansatz ultimately leads to a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "how this reduction method is performed on the problem of oscillator populations and leads to a finite set of equations has been reported in detail elsewhere .",
    "@xcite we skip the full derivation and state the resulting reduced equations : @xmath26 where @xmath27 the variable @xmath28 takes account for the _ local _ order for each population and found to be related to the global order parameter via @xmath29 the dynamics of the oscillators is described by two variables per population : @xmath30 describes their degree of synchronization and @xmath31 represents the average phase of the oscillators in each population .    before analyzing these equations ,",
    "we restrict our attention to specific symmetry manifolds .",
    "perfectly synchronized populations have @xmath32 and desynchronized populations have @xmath33 ; the latter consists of oscillators that drift relative to one another and to the synchronized populations .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote synchronized and desynchronized populations , respectively . in the triangular network , due to its rotational invariance , we could only distinguish two chimera states , namely @xmath36 ( sync - drift - sync ) and @xmath37 ( drift - sync - drift ) .",
    "the situation is different here , and other chimeras are possible in the case of @xmath17 : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and their symmetry - equivalent reflections across the center population .",
    "these states are however not the focus of this study and are excluded in our analysis .",
    "the @xmath36 state is defined as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , whereas the @xmath37 state has @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "we have reduced the governing equations ( [ eq : goveqns2 ] ) to a low dimensional system for the local order parameters , and we have cast our problem into a two dimensional system represented by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sdshybrid2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dsdhybrid2 ] ) .",
    "this enables us now to study the problem in the phase plane .",

    "the associated bifurcation diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd_hybridc1 ] , where we compare the triangular case ( left ) with the symmetry breaking case ( right ) .",

    "we keep the parameter @xmath55 constant while increasing the value of @xmath14 step by step : close to global coupling , i.e. for small values of @xmath14 , we only observe the always present in - phase @xmath56 solution . as we increase @xmath14 , a stable chimera",
    "is born in a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "one step further , the chimera loses its stability through a hopf bifurcation and a limit cycle is born , which corresponds to a so - called _ breathing chimera _ with an oscillating order parameter . increasing @xmath14 further",
    ", we observe how the limit cycle grows and eventually collides with the saddle and is destroyed in a homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "the saddle - node curve , hopf and homoclinic bifurcation curves all intersect in the bogdanov - takens ( bt ) point of codimension two .        the @xmath37 symmetry exhibits a similar bifurcation structure : for small @xmath14 , the scenario is identical to the one seen for the @xmath36 symmetry ; however for larger @xmath14 , the scenario is repeated in _ reversed order _ ( with increasing values of @xmath14 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "we consider now the symmetry breaking case relatively close to the triangular symmetry with @xmath57 .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams are obtained by inspection of phase portraits ( large dots in the figure ) .",
    "saddle node and hopf curves may be calculated analytically by simultaneously solving the fixed point equations ( [ eq : sdshybrid2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dsdhybrid2 ] ) with either the saddle node condition , @xmath58 or the hopf condition , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the jacobian of ( [ eq : sdshybrid2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dsdhybrid2 ] ) . the resulting equations are solved using a series approach with @xmath55 as a bifurcation parameter , similar to the method described in detail in earlier work ,  @xcite however by assigning a desired value to @xmath15 before computing the series coefficients .",
    "the perturbation series for @xmath61 yield no further insight and we omit them here for brevity .",
    "we observe a similar bifurcation scenario as before in the triangular case , but there is an important qualitative change : the parameter region allowing for @xmath36 chimeras ( above ) has shrunk in parameter space , whereas the attractor region of @xmath37 chimeras ( below ) has grown .",
    "interestingly , it looks as if the homoclinic curves for the @xmath37 chimera now coincide for a wide range of @xmath55 values .",
    "unfortunately we could not confirm this behavior analytically , as we were unable to determine the melnikov integrals leading to homoclinic conditions , but the phenomenon is not essential for the matter of this study .",
    "moreover , the bogdanov - takens ( bt ) points have moved to the left and right , respectively , according to the shrinking or growing of the regions of existence for chimeras .",
