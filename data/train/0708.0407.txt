    "four of our sources remain ` radio - loud ' in this definition as well , while three are borderline , although possibly still radio - loud given the rough derivation above . in addition , the screen extinction correction we apply to @xmath20 is likely to overestimate the mid - ir luminosities . with no strong dichotomy between our ` radio - loud ' and ` radio - quiet ' sources ,",

    "our sources do not represent a complete census of massive black holes at @xmath0@xmath12 , and are likely to experience further growth between then and @xmath0@xmath10 . with this in mind , can we reconcile such massive black holes at @xmath0@xmath12 with the space density of massive black holes today ?",

    "@xcite estimate the space density of black holes with @xmath43@xmath483@xmath40@xmath41@xmath42  ( typical of our sources ) is @xmath13@xmath40@xmath49mpc@xmath47 locally .",
    "this generous gap between the space densities implies we are not overproducing black holes at @xmath0@xmath12 .",
    "our study for the first time directly demonstrates the existence of deep silicate absorption ( @xmath2@xmath116 ) radio - loud sources at @xmath0@xmath12 .",
    "this is in strong contrast with @xmath0@xmath81 radio - loud populations where none have @xmath2@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the high obscurations of our sources is largely a selection bias , as our sample was selected to be mid - ir bright and red (  2 ) .",
    "however , _",
    "high radio fluxes are not part of our selection _ , and hence the 40% radio - loud fraction of our high-@xmath19 @xmath0@xmath12 sources is a real effect .",
    "this implies a direct or indirect coupling between the radio source and surrounding ism . @xcite",
    "present a @xmath0@xmath12 sample similar to ours , but including a radio selection . a quick analysis of their sample yields two sources that are both radio - loud , and have @xmath2@xmath31 , further supporting to our results .    the much greater @xmath50 ratios of our sources relative to local radio - loud sources imply we are observing these sources in the brief window between the birth of the radio source and before feedback effects have shed the dusty envelope and halted the starburst and/or black hole accretion .",
    "@xcite argue that the ir - brightness is anti - correlated with the age of the radio source consistent with a radio source - driven feedback scenario .",
    "given the age of mips15880 ( @xmath23@xmath29yrs ) , its radio jets are not necessarily powerful enough to accomplish this .",
    "but this may be a function of radio luminosity",
    ". mrc1138 - 262 , a @xmath0=2.2 radio galaxy more than two orders of magnitude more radio - luminous than our sources , does show powerful outflows , which are probably driven by lateral shocks from the radio jets @xcite .",
    "a mid - ir study of a sample of @xmath0@xmath12 radio galaxies , covering a range of radio luminosities , would therefore provide very useful constraints on radio jet / ism interactions at the epoch when radio galaxies are in the process of shedding their dusty envelopes .",
    "the above does not explain why our sources should have deeper silicate absorption than local radio - loud populations .",
    "the answer hinges on the unknown origin of the mid - ir obscuration  s.a .",
    "dusty torus or host galaxy .",
    "the deep silicate features of our sources imply optically thick obscuring media with high filling factors ( i.e. likely puffed - up geometry , but not 4@xmath51 given the radio jets ) as they have to effectively ` hide ' the hot inner regions of the agn @xcite .",
    "agn tori are believed to be clumpy , which precludes high filling factors @xcite , consistent with their observed weak silicate features @xcite .",
    "higher @xmath2 can be due to a cold dust screen @xcite , such as expected from a dusty host galaxy .",
    "high-@xmath0 radio galaxies / radio - loud quasars have been detected in the sub - mm indicating cold dust @xcite .",
    "we already know that the number density of deeply obscured sources is about 10 times higher at @xmath0@xmath12 than at @xmath0@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "lastly , mips16122 is consistent with a jet axis close to the line - of - sight ( @xmath3045@xmath31 ) .",
    "the dusty torus of an agn is believed to be coupled with the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying a nearly face - on torus for mips16122 , which is unlikely given its deep silicate absorption feature . on the other hand , a mis - match between the orientation of the host galaxy and agn is frequently observed @xcite .",
    "thus , although the origin of the mid - ir obscuration remains an open question , host galaxy obscuration is a good candidate .",
