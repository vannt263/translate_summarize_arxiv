    "considering the phenomenological discussion on the proton structure functions measured by deep - inelastic scattering of electrons and positrons at hera , it is striking to realize that the proposed models , on one side for the total quark structure function @xmath0 @xcite and on the other side for its diffractive component @xmath1 @xcite are in general distinct . indeed",
    ", the models @xcite aiming at the description of @xmath0 use a qcd - inspired `` hard pomeron '' parametrisation related either to a dglap @xcite evolution with extrapolation at small-@xmath2 @xcite or to bfkl @xcite dynamics . on the other hand , most of the models proposed for the diffractive component of the quark structure function rely on a `` soft pomeron '' picture of diffraction , assuming a point - like structure of the pomeron considered as a compound particle @xcite .",
    "it is known since some time , however , that at high energies the elastic scattering and diffraction dissociation of hadrons are closely related @xcite , being both a reflection of the same phenomenon , namely _ absorption _ of the incident particle wave in the target .",
    "it seems therefore interesting to verify if the same applies also to the incident virtual photons .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate this question in the framework of the qcd dipole picture @xcite .",
    "this picture turned out already to be successful in the description of the total virtual photon - nucleon cross - section ( i.e. of total nucleon structure function @xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to verify if the so - called rapidity gap events @xcite discovered recently at hera can also be described along these lines .",
    "diffractive dissociation of the virtual photons in the framework of the qcd dipole picture was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the diffractive cross - section consists of two components :    -(component i ) the _ inelastic _ component when the gluon cascade which evolved from the incident virtual photon interacts inelastically with the target , see fig.1a .",
    "this component ( corresponding to the 3-pomeron interaction in the regge terminology ) contributes mainly to the region of very large mass @xmath4 of the diffractively excited system : @xmath5 , where , as usual , @xmath6 .",
    "-(component ii ) the _ quasi - elastic _ component when the @xmath7 pair emerging from the virtual photon scatters elastically from the target , see fig.1b .",
    "this component contributes to the region of smaller masses @xmath8 .",
    "the model calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite provided the formulae for differential cross - section @xmath9 of both components i and ii .",
    "unfortunately , for technical reasons , some rather drastic assumptions had to be made :    \\(a ) the calculations were performed in the limit of large impact parameters .",
    "the integrated cross - section was then estimated by integration only up to a certain cut - off @xmath10 .",
    "this procedure leads to a serious underestimate of the cross - section @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) the target nucleon was treated as a collection of several qcd dipoles all of the same size and sitting at one point .",
    "this assumption neglects the effects of nucleon form - factor and thus leads to an overestimation of the cross - sections .",
    "we are thus led to the conclusion that there are at present no reliable predictions for the _ absolute normalization _ of the diffractive cross - sections of the virtual photons . in this situation , in order to compare the predictions with the data we decided to treat the normalization constants in the two components as arbitrary parameters and restrict ourselves to the comparison of the observed dependence on kinematic variables to that predicted by the formulae of refs .",
    "@xcite ( c.f .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "our work should thus be treated as an exploratory search which is a guide for further investigation and should be repeated once more reliable calculations are available . within these _ caveats _ our investigation leads to the conclusion that the data on rapidity gap events published recently by h1 collaboration @xcite are reasonably well described by the qcd dipole picture and thus the good - walker idea seems consistent with these data .",
    "the plan of our investigations is as follows . in the next section",
    "we remind briefly the qcd dipole picture results for the total photon - nucleon cross - section , introduce the necessary notation and perform a fit for the total structure function . in section 3",
    "we summarize the formulae for diffractive cross - section of the components ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "these results are compared to the data @xcite in section 4 .",
    "finally section 5 contains our conclusions , as well as an outlook for further work .",
    "in the qcd - dipole picture of high - energy scattering of two initial small - size @xmath11 _ onia _ ( massive @xmath7 states ) , the total cross - section at fixed impact parameter @xmath12 can be obtained from the all - order qcd resummation of the elementary dipole - dipole cross - sections @xmath13 where dipole states of transverse diameter @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) appear in the wave - function of the initial states of transverse diameter @xmath16 ( resp.@xmath17 ) at the `` time '' of interaction .",
    "this `` time '' variable is represented by a rapidity variable @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a phenomenological constant @xcite and @xmath20 is the bjorken variable labelling the softer end of the produced dipole .",
    "one writes @xmath21 where the partition of the total `` time '' @xmath22 between the target and projectile is arbitrary , provided @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the multiplicity of dipoles of size @xmath25 integrated over the transverse distance from the center of the onium , generated from an initial dipole of size @xmath16 after a `` time '' @xmath26 it is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the eigenvalue of the bfkl kernel @xcite , and @xmath29 is the number of colours .    the elementary dipole - dipole cross - sections are obtained from the gluon - exchange graphs and give @xcite @xmath30 \\left [ 1-{j% } _ { 0}\\left ( \\ell \\bar \\rho\\right ) \\right]i\\nonumber \\\\ = 2\\pi \\alpha^2 \\rho_<^2\\left[1+\\ln(\\rho_>/\\rho_<)\\right ]   .",

    "the distributions of the primary dipoles in the virtual photons are known @xcite and thus the corresponding integrals can be performed with the result @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 refers to transverse and longitudinal photons , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is the total charge of the quarks whose flavour contributes to the reaction , and @xmath39 see formula ( [ 5b ] ) .",
    "the path integral in ( [ 5c ] ) can be evaluated by the saddle point method ( giving good approximation as @xmath40 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 ^{-1 } , \\;\\ ;   \\delta _ { p } \\equiv \\delta(1 ) = 4\\ln 2\\;\\alpha n/\\pi   \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the well - known coefficients appearing in the solution of bfkl dynamics for the pomeron @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ 5x ] ) gives the prediction for the nucleon structure functions in terms of four parameters : the strong coupling constant @xmath45 , the average number of primary dipoles in the proton @xmath33 , their average radius @xmath46 and the constant @xmath19 fixing the rapidity scale of the problem .",
    "it coincides with the one used in the published fit @xcite apart the new parameter @xmath19 which sets the rapidity scale of the process , and is unavoidable in the leading log approximation of qcd .",
    "this justifies a new fit of @xmath3 using formula ( [ 5x ] ) which we have performed assuming @xmath47 ( as in @xcite ) and leaving free the three other parameters . the result is @xmath48    the fit ( displayed in fig.2 ) is using the published data from the h1 experiment @xcite .",
    "we have only considered the points with @xmath49 to remain in a reasonable domain of validity of the qcd dipole model . changing this value does not appreciably change the quality and parameters of the fit .",
    "the @xmath50 is 88.7 for 130 points .",
    "although not included in the fit , the data points at high @xmath51 and @xmath52 are well described , while at higher @xmath53 an expected contribution of valence quarks is needed .",
    "commenting on the parameters , let us note that the effective coupling constant extracted from @xmath54 is @xmath55 , close to @xmath56 used in the h1 qcd fit .",
    "it is an acceptable value for the small coupling constant required by the bfkl framework which is expected to be decreased by the next leading contributions @xcite . ] .",
    "the value of @xmath57 corresponds to a transverse radius of @xmath58 which is in the correct range for a proton non - perturbative characteristic scale .",
    "the value of @xmath33 determines the number of primordial dipoles in the proton to be about @xmath59 ( if three flavours contribute to the process ) which also does not seem unreasonable . the parameter @xmath19 sets the `` time '' scale for the formation of the interacting dipoles .",
    "it defines the effective total rapidity interval which is @xmath60 the constant being not predictable ( but of order 1 ) at the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "the obtained fit for @xmath3 is very similar than the previously published one in ref .",
    "@xcite , even with a better @xmath61 . in the same spirit ,",
    "relation ( 11 ) provides a parameter - free prediction for the gluon density ( not shown in the figures ) which is , as the previous one @xcite , in good agreement with the results obtained by the h1 qcd fits based on a nlo dglap evolution equation @xcite . using the factorization properties of formula ( 11 ) and noting @xcite that the @xmath62 structure function is given by a similar formula with @xmath63 replaced by @xmath64 one obtains a parameter - free prediction for @xmath62 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "note that we obtain a prediction in agreement with the ( indirect ) experimental determination for @xmath65 @xcite , but somewhat lower than the center values .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to obtain a more precise measurement of @xmath62 to test the different predictions on the @xmath66-evolution as already mentionned in ref .",
    "the diffractive structure functions are related to the corresponding diffractive @xmath67-nucleon cross - sections by the relation @xmath68 where @xmath69 .    as already explained in the first section , in the qcd dipole model",
    "the diffractive structure functions are given by two components : inelastic and quasi - elastic .",
    "they were discussed in @xcite where the formulae for @xmath67-dipole diffractive cross - sections were derived and used to construct the corresponding structure functions following the formula .",
    "these results are summarized below .",
    "\\(i ) inelastic component .",
    "@xmath70    where @xmath37 are defined in ( [ 19 ] ) , @xmath71and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 is the hypergeometric function ) . in the interesting 3-pomeron limit ( @xmath74 ) the path integral can be evaluated by the saddle point method with the result @xmath75 where @xmath76 is catalan s constant , @xmath43 , @xmath77 .",
    "the important features of eq.([17 ] ) , pointed out in @xcite are    \\(a ) an approximate factorization of the @xmath78 and @xmath66 dependences .",
    "\\(b ) important logarithmic corrections of the form @xmath79 to the main power law factor @xmath80 these corrections lower the effective pomeron intercept for diffractive dissociation , in qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "\\(c ) there is a significant scaling violation , because @xmath81 depends explicitly on @xmath66 .",
    "\\(ii ) quasi - elastic component .",
    "it was discussed in @xcite , where the formulae for diffractive cross - sections in @xmath67-dipole collisions were given . from these formulae",
    "one can derive the following expression for the diffractive structure functions .",
    "@xmath82    and    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the amplitude for elastic scattering of a dipole of diameter @xmath14 on a dipole of diameter @xmath34 at impact parameter @xmath86 .    in ref.@xcite",
    "this amplitude was approximated by its asymptotic form valid for large @xmath86 which reads @xmath87 and for that reason the integration over @xmath86 was performed from @xmath34 to @xmath88 ( the meaning of the formula ( [ 33a ] ) for @xmath89 is rather doubtful ) .",
    "the main qualitative features of this quasi - elastic component , pointed out in @xcite , are    \\(a ) a similar @xmath78 dependence as the inelastic component , with important logarithmic corrections bringing down the pomeron intercept .",
    "\\(b ) as expected , the quasi - elastic component vanishes at @xmath90 and actually populates significantly only the region @xmath8 .",
    "\\(c ) the dependence on @xmath91 of the transversal and longitudinal structure functions is dramatically distinct .",
    "@xmath92 dominates in the region @xmath93 whereas @xmath94 takes over at small @xmath91 .",
    "the sum of the two components , however , is almost constant in the range @xmath95 .",
    "the formulae presented in section 4 were obtained in @xcite by calculating first the cross - section of @xmath67 on a single dipole of a fixed transverse diameter @xmath34 in the limit of very large impact parameter @xmath86 .",
    "the obtained formulae were then extrapolated until @xmath96 and integrated from @xmath10 to @xmath88 . finally the result was multiplied by @xmath97 to account for the number of the dipoles in the target nucleon ( determined from the fit of the formula for @xmath3 to the data ) .    these approximations allowed to perform explicit calculations and to discuss the general behaviour of diffractive structure functions @xcite .",
    "they are , however , not valid in the important region where the impact parameter @xmath86 is of the order of the size of the original dipoles @xcite and therefore the results given in the formulae of section 3 can not be treated as precise predictions of the qcd dipole picture ( ie . of bfkl dynamics ) for several reasons .",
    "first , the asymptotic formula for large impact parameter ignores entirely the singularities of the dipole - dipole amplitudes , which become important when the impact parameter is of the order of the size of the colliding dipoles .",
    "this defect leads to a serious underestimation in the normalization of the calculated cross - sections .",
    "however , the conformal invariance of the bfkl dynamics @xcite insures that the general dependence on kinematic variables remains - to a good approximation- unaffected .",
    "second , the cross - section for scattering on a single dipole of the size @xmath34 , even if multiplied by @xmath97 , can not be directly used for the estimation of the cross - section on the nucleon target .",
    "the reason is twofold : ( i ) it is unlikely that all the primary dipoles in the nucleon are of the same size @xmath34 and thus the distribution of their sizes must be taken into account , ( ii ) the single - dipole cross - section ignores entirely the distribution of the transverse position of the primary dipoles in the nucleon , i.e. it ignores the effects of the nucleon form - factor .",
    "although these effects are not present in forward scattering amplitudes ( and therefore they do not influence the calculation of the total cross - section ) they largely determine the momentum transfer dependence and thus reduce significantly the cross - section integrated over momentum transfer to the target nucleon .",
    "to summarize , we note @xcite two effects which were not included in the calculations given in @xcite and which are expected to affect substantially the normalization of the obtained diffractive structure functions .",
    "in this situation before a more precise calculation is available , we treat the normalization of the two components as free parameters , in order to phenomenologically evaluate the main conditions for a test of the unified description of proton structure functions .",
    "we thus compare the experimental data to the formula @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are constructed from the formulae ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 32a ] ) using @xmath101 .",
    "since this procedure can at best be considered only as an exploratory search , we did not try to perform a fit , but simply tried a few values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 to see if one can obtain a qualitative agreement of ( [ 35 ] ) to the data . in fig.4",
    "the results of these calculations are shown for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "one sees that a general description of the data is quite reasonable for @xmath106 except in the region of large @xmath91 where the @xmath66 dependence of the quasi - elastic component is not fully adequate .",
    "we find this result rather satisfactory , given the present status of the theoretical calculations .",
    "thus -although the final answer must wait till more precise qcd dipole calculations are available- our tentative conclusion is that the existing data on rapidity - gap events do not rule out the bfkl dynamics as a correct description of the diffractive phenomena involving virtual photons .",
    "indeed a decisive test will come along with more complete theoretical calculations e.g. @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the bfkl dynamics , as represented by the qcd dipole picture , is is in qualitative agreement with the @xmath107-dimensional data on rapidity - gap events being observed at hera .",
    "further theoretical work is needed , however , to arrive at more precise conclusions .",
    "in particular , it is necessary :    \\(a ) to evaluate the @xmath67 cross - sections without the large-@xmath86 approximation used in @xcite .",
    "the work on inelastic component was recently completed @xcite and the quasi - elastic component will be available in the near future .",
    "\\(b ) since the effects related to the nucleon form - factor are expected to influence significantly the results , a serious phenomenological discussion of the nucleon form - factor in the framework of the qcd dipole picture is required .",
    "more precise data on momentum transfer dependence of the diffractive structure functions would be of great help .",
    "we feel that this program is feasible and thus one may hope that a unified picture of the high - energy diffractive processes involving the virtual photons , based on bfkl dynamics , may indeed be constructed in the near future .    99 h1 coll .",
