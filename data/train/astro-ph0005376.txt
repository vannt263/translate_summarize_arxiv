    "since the discovery by iras of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( l(8 - 1000@xmath0 m ) @xmath1 10@xmath2l@xmath3 ) which emit the bulk of their energy in the infrared , a large number of studies have shown that intense star forming regions as well as agns are necessary to explain these high luminosities ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "large concentrations of molecular gas are needed for fueling nuclear starbursts and/or agns .",
    "consequently , absorption makes the distinction between starburst and agn activity difficult and the estimate of their relative contribution to the total infrared luminosity is far from straightforward . optical classification ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    "is plagued by extinction , while radio wavelengths , although free from extinction , do not result in a definite classification ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "based on x - ray observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ground - based infrared observations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and on iso observations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , considerable progress has been made in defining the fraction of the agn / starburst contributions to the bolometric luminosity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies .    to further examine the agn and starburst connection ,",
    "we have observed a sample of nearby active and interacting galaxies harboring starburst regions and/or agns using isocam . due to the unique spectro - imaging capabilities of the camera which provide an angular resolution of 4 - 8arcsec between 5 and 16@xmath0 m ( 200 - 400pc at 10mpc )",
    ", we can reveal and study obscured central regions not visible at optical wavelengths ( a@xmath4@xmath5a@xmath6/70 , @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present an empirical method to distinguish and quantify the mir emission coming from starbursts and agns .",
    "our approach is based on a new mir diagnostic for estimating the relative importance of these two main energy sources found in galactic centers .",
    "our sample and the data reduction methods are described in section 2 .",
    "a brief summary of the typical mir emission encountered in these galaxies is presented in section 3 , while our mir templates and diagnostic diagrams are shown in section 4 .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications in section 5 and the final conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "a large sample of nearby galaxies hosting star formation activity and agn signatures ( see table [ sample ] ) was observed with the isocam camera ( @xcite ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso , @xcite ) .",
    "all observations come from the isocam consortium guaranteed time programs and most of them were part of the active galaxy proposal camactiv ( p.i .",
    "mirabel , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies have been observed either in the spectro - imaging mode with the circular variable filter ( cvf ) or in the raster mode with broad band filters .",
    "the cvf covers a spectral range from 5 to 16@xmath0 m with a spectral resolution of @xmath540 . for cvf scans ,",
    "a single pointing was made for each galaxy , using 1.5 - 3arcsec / pixels , giving a total field of view for the 32@xmath732 pixel array of 0.8 - 1.6arcmin .",
    "the spatial resolution is 4 - 8arcsec limited by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "high spatial resolution and sensitivity are essential in our analysis in order to isolate the central regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "approximately 12 exposures of 2 - 5s each were made at each wavelength in addition to @xmath520 exposures at the start of each observation to decrease the initial detector transient effects .",
    "the raster maps were made with various broad band filters designed to select distinct features such as the continuum emission of the very small grains using the lw3(12 - 18@xmath0 m ) filter , and the uibs with the lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) and lw4(5.5 - 6.5@xmath0 m ) filters .",
    "depending on the apparent size of the galaxy , a pixel field of view of 1.5 or 3arcsec was selected .",
    "most of the maps were 2@xmath72 rasters with 6 pixel overlap consisting of approximately 200 exposures of 2 - 5s each .",
    "another 30 exposures were added at the start of the observations to decrease the effects of transients .",
    "the isocam data were analyzed with the cam interactive analysis software ( cia ) and were calibrated with the general methods described in @xcite . to correct for the dark current ,",
    "a dark model taking into account the observing time parameters was subtracted .",
    "cosmic ray hits were removed by applying a multiresolution median filtering ( @xcite ) .",
    "corrections of detector memory effects were made with the so - called inversion method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flat field correction was performed using the library of calibration data .",
    "finally , individual exposures were combined using shift techniques in order to correct the jitter effect due to the satellite motions ( amplitude @xmath5 0.5arcsec ) . to derive the photometry of individual galaxy regions , aperture corrections as well as deconvolution techniques ( @xcite ) , were applied to account for the overall extension of the psf in a few cases .",
    "we estimate that the absolute uncertainty of our photometric measurements is @xmath520@xmath8 while the error in the relative uncertainty mainly due to errors on transient effect correction is @xmath510@xmath8 .",
    "mir spectra ( 5 - 16@xmath0 m ) in galaxies can mainly arise from a variety of physical components including : 1 ) the evolved stellar population ( rayleigh - jeans regime ) , which can dominate in early - type galaxies , 2 ) emission from the ionized interstellar gas , 3 ) non - thermal emission from radio sources and 4 ) dust particules responsible for the underlying continuum and 5 ) carriers of uibs centered at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath0 m .",
    "the uibs are thought to be due to c = c and c  h stretching and bending vibration modes in carbonaceous materials ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and they dominate the mir spectra of galaxies with low or intermediate star formation activity ( @xcite ) as in pdrs ( @xcite ) and diffuse galactic regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the dust emitting longward of about 10@xmath0 m , is attributed to very small grains ( here - after vsgs ) with radius less than 10 nm ( @xcite ) , and is prominent in regions actively forming stars , such as galactic hii regions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and in starburst regions . to emit in the mir , the carriers of the uibs and the vsgs",
    "are thought to be stochastically heated by the stellar radiation field reaching temperature fluctuations of the order of 100 - 1000 k ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the emission from ionized gas is mainly observed through forbidden lines such as [ arii](6.9@xmath0 m ) , [ nevi](7.6@xmath0 m ) , [ ariii](8.9@xmath0 m ) , [ siv](10.5@xmath0 m ) , [ neii](12.8@xmath0 m ) , [ nev](14.3@xmath0 m ) and [ neiii](15.6@xmath0 m ) .",
    "because of their high ionization potential , these lines can be used to trace the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "the presence of [ nevi ] and [ nev ] has also provided evidence for agns ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or supernova remnants ( @xcite ) .    in order to understand how the total mir emission in our sample of starbursts and agns varies according to these different contributions , we first review the well - studied mir properties in resolved nearby galaxies from early - type to later type disk galaxies and then address our observations in light of these properties .",

    "the mir spectra of elliptical galaxies , usually poor in cold gas and dust , are produced primarily by their evolved stellar population , and can be shown to resemble a blackbody continuum with temperatures ranging from 4000 to 6000k ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this stellar emission accounts for most of the mir emission of some elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , a non - negligible fraction of elliptical galaxies shows emission from uibs and hot dust ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as emission from non - thermal sources .",
    "the mir spectra of spiral galaxies , rich in gas and dust , are largely dominated by the uibs .",
    "the observed uib features show little spectral variations , and the total broad band lw3(12 - 18@xmath28)/lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) flux ratio is close to 1 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this ratio has been proposed as an indicator of the fraction of the vsg continuum to the uib feature emission . as an example of the `` typical '' integrated mir emission of normal spiral galaxies , we present in figure  [ fig1 ] the spectrum of a region in the disk of m82 , 45arcsec away from the central starburst .",
    "the usual uib features , fitted by lorentzian profiles , are prominent .",
    "in addition , we notice the presence of several faint uibs at 5.3 , 5.7 , 12.0 , 13.6 and 14.3@xmath0 m ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similar mir spectra are also found in regions of the galactic disk ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the mir spectra of galaxies with evidence of starburst activity have distinct features compared to normal spiral galaxies .",
    "their most prominent characteristic is the presence of a very steeply rising continuum at 12 - 16@xmath0 m from the vsgs . in starburst regions ,",
    "this continuum is primarily produced in hii regions , tracing regions of massive star formation activity .",
    "the hard radiation field from young stars also excites ionic lines from [ arii ] , [ ariii ] , [ siv ] , [ neii ] and [ neiii ] which can be seen in the mir spectra of starbursts .",
    "we display an example of this continuum in figure [ fig2 ] ( solid line ) using the spectrum near a pure hii region observed in m17 , where the mir emission is almost completely dominated by the vsg continuum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weak intensity of uibs is interpreted as a consequence of the destruction of their carriers . however , since the uibs originate from diffuse regions as well as pdrs surrounding hii regions , where they peak ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , strong uibs can be detected in the mir spectrum of embedded starburst regions .",
    "consequently , this depletion of the uib carriers will be further enhanced relative to the observed relative increase of the mir continuum in starburst regions ( see spectrum of knota in the antennae galaxies , @xcite )",
    ". therefore , the lw3(12 - 18@xmath0 m ) to lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) flux ratio increases in strong starburst environments .",
    "one should note that the overall mir spectral shape can be also considerably affected by the high extinction often found in starburst regions .",
    "in particular the silicate band centered at 9.7@xmath0 m can suppress the strength of uibs at 11.3 , 8.6 and 6.2@xmath29 relative to that at 7.7@xmath0 m ( @xcite , @xcite ) as seen in the spectrum of arp220 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several studies have already shown that mir spectra in agns also present weak uibs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in the spectrum of the nearest agn of our sample located in the radio galaxy centaurus a ( cena , ngc5128 , @xcite ) .    in the mir observations of cena , we have sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle the emission of the central regions near the agn from that due to star forming regions of the galactic disk .",
    "the absence of uibs in the central 5arcsec ( @xmath5 100pc ) possibly indicates the destruction of their carriers by the intense uv - x - ray radiation field from the agn ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is a noticeable continuum at short wavelengths ( 3 - 10@xmath0 m ) commonly attributed to hot dust , associated with the torus of molecular gas proposed in the unified model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the alternative interpretation of supernova remnants ( snrs ) as the physical mechanism explaining the agn phenomenon ( @xcite ) is not supported by the mir observations .",
    "nearby snrs , such as cassiopeia a , kepler , the crab , rcw 103 and ic443 are all characterized by strong ionic and/or molecular line emission and a faint continuum ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these characteristic features are not found in our integrated mir spectra of galactic nuclei which are known to harbor agns .",
    "the mir spectrum of agns is flatter compared to that of pure hii regions ( see the agn and hii spectra in figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with iras observations where infrared spectra from active galaxies are generaly significantly flatter with the peak of emission shifted towards the mir ( @xcite ) . near an agn the radiation field can heat dust up to evaporation temperatures of @xmath51000k for silicate and @xmath51500k for graphite . as a result ,",
    "the dust continuum emission becomes prominent at short wavelengths ( 3 - 6@xmath0 m ) in contrast to emission from star forming regions which appears at longer wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a continuum is found in the center of all galaxies in our sample known to be hosting an agn such as ngc1068 , ngc6814 or ngc 3147 ( @xcite ) .",
    "highly ionized species tracing the hard radiation field of the agn ( e.g. [ nev]14.3@xmath0 m and [ nevi]7.6@xmath0 m ) are detected in ngc1068 .",
    "however , due to the low spectral resolution of isocam spectra ( @xmath3040 ) , the [ nev ] and [ nevi ] , if they exist , are blended with the nearby uibs in all of our galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our diagnostics are based on the assumption that the integrated mir emission in galaxies can be represented by a sum of contributions originating from ( 1 ) regions where the dust is predominantly heated by an agn and ( 2 ) regions where star formation is the main source of energy . as mentionned in sections 3.1 and 3.2 ,",
    "star forming regions can also be divided in two classes : relatively quiescent regions where most of the mir emission originates from the pdrs , and starburst - like regions where continuum emission at 15@xmath0 m produced in the hii regions is dominant .",
    "we therefore propose to categorize the spectra from our sample using empirical criteria chosen to separate the distinct uib and mir continuum behaviours . to further examine the relative proportion of each contribution",
    ", we also compare our spectra with three templates , namely , agns , pure hii regions and isolated pdrs .",
    "the relative proportions of these templates required to reproduce a given mir spectrum allow us to classify the observed region as mir spectral type dominated by agn , starburst or relatively quiescent regions .",
    "to construct the templates of each component , we selected three isocam cvf spectra dominated by each of these physical processes .",
    "these template spectra are presented in figure [ fig5]a .",
    "the strong continuum at 14 - 15@xmath0 m observed in starburst galaxies was modeled by a typical pure hii galactic region spectrum from m17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "uibs are absent or faint ( upper panel of figure [ fig5]a ) and the [ ariii](8.9@xmath0 m ) , [ siv](10.5@xmath0 m ) , [ neii](12.8@xmath0 m ) and [ neiii](15.6@xmath0 m ) are present .",
    "a typical starburst spectrum can be usually decomposed using the vsg continuum with some uib emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "since uibs originate mainly from pdrs or diffuse regions , we used as their template , an isolated pdr spectrum from the galactic reflection nebula ngc7023 ( @xcite ) ( see the lower right part of the figure [ fig5]a ) .",
    "the agn component was characterised by the mir spectrum of the central region of cena ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the lower left part of the figure [ fig5]a ) , in which uibs are absent as in the hii region template .",
    "however , in contrast to the hii region template spectrum , the continuum at short wavelengths ( 5 - 10@xmath0 m ) is prominent in the agn spectrum .",
    "in addition , the equivalent width of emission lines of [ neii ] and [ neiii ] is small , perhaps due to the overwhelming continuum contribution . note that extinction affects the agn template and is greater in cena than in ngc1068 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .      as",
    "each mir template has distinct characteristics , we can quantify their relative contribution to the integrated spectrum .",
    "we have used two indicators based on the uib strength and the mir continuum . as an indicator of the relative hii region and agn contribution",
    ", we use the ratio of `` warm '' ( 14 - 15@xmath0 m ) to `` hot '' ( 5.1 - 6.8@xmath0 m ) continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . as this",
    "ratio decreases , the presence of an agn becomes more evident due to the increase of the relative importance of the `` hot '' continuum .",
    "the uib(6.2@xmath0 m ) to continuum ( 5.1 - 6.8@xmath0 m ) flux ratio can be used to identify the relative contributions of the quiescent star forming regions to the starburst and/or agn mir emission .",
    "this indicator is very similar to the one proposed by genzel which is based on the strength of the 7.7@xmath0 m feature ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our estimate of the uib flux has the advantage to be less affected by the strong silicate extinction at 9 - 11@xmath0 m while the continuum at 5 - 7@xmath0 m is also less contaminated by the vsg continuum .",
    "the effect of a strong absorption on the agn continuum could artificially enhance the presence of a uib at 7.7@xmath0 m but not at 6.2@xmath0 m .",
    "nevertheless , the choice of the 6.2@xmath0 m which is weaker than the 7.7@xmath0 m feature necessitates spectra with good signal to noise ratio .",
    "this is the case in our sample of spectra where the uib at 6.2@xmath0 m is very well detected ( figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig7 ] or the spectra in the antennae in @xcite , for some examples ) . since our primary goal is to establish the absence of uibs as well as the presence of a well detected agn continuum , at short mir wavelengths , a criterion based on the uib(5.9 - 6.8@xmath0m)/continuum(5.1 - 6.8@xmath0 m ) ratio applied on high signal to noise spectra gives a more accurate diagnostic for revealing the presence of an agn . as we show in the following sections , the relative variation of our uib / continuum at 6@xmath0 m is reliable in separating a featureless continuum from uib spectra even if our 6@xmath0 m continuum measurements may still be slightly affected by emission coming from the wing of the 7.7@xmath0 m uib ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .      having defined the three mir templates , we construct a complete library of composite spectra where the contribution of each template can vary between 0 and 100@xmath8 . on these composite spectra",
    ", we can measure the diagnostic ratios presented above and plot them on a 2-dimensional diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "three main regions can be identified in the corners of this diagram where the signatures of agns , starbursts , or quiescent star forming regions dominate the total spectrum .",
    "the above diagram can be applied only in the galaxies where mir spectra are available .",
    "however , one may expand it to cases where only broad band mir images are available .",
    "this can be done by using our library of spectra to estimate their corresponding fluxes through the isocam filters that isolate as closely as possible the regions identified in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the filters used are the lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) , lw3(12 - 18@xmath0 m ) and lw4(5.5 - 6.5@xmath0 m ) .",
    "as we will show in the following sections the broad band diagnostic gives results comparable to those obtained with the cvfs .",
    "the equivalent fluxes of our cvf templates through the three broad band filters are presented in figure [ fig5]b . using the same reasoning as in figure [ fig5]a , we estimate the relative strength of uibs with the lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0m)/lw4(5.5 - 6.5@xmath0 m ) flux ratio while the ratio of the lw3(12 - 18@xmath0m)/lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) emission provides an estimate of the vsg contribution relative to the uib and/or hot dust emission at short wavelengths .",
    "those two diagnostic diagrams have in common the capacity to separate individualy regions dominated by agn , starburst or quiescent star forming regions .",
    "the robustness of the two criteria against observed mir spectra of galaxies is examined in the following section .",
    "our mir indicators were applied to the galaxies of our sample ( see table [ sample ] ) , in which we also included a few irregular galaxies such as the blue compact dwarf galaxies iizw40 and ngc1569 ( @xcite ) and barred spiral galaxies ngc 1097 and ngc 1365 ( @xcite ) in order to cover the diagram completely . in cases where we had adequate spatial resolution , we extracted different physical regions in the same galaxy .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "galaxies commonly classified as starbursts , such as arp220 and arp299(a ) , fall toward the top part of the diagram implying the presence of a large fraction of starburst regions compared to quiescent star forming regions . a few nearby galaxies with known agns",
    "are located in the bottom left part of the diagram along with our agn template , the nucleus of cena .",
    "regions of moderate star formation observed in galactic disks are situated in the region of the diagram where we expect to find a dominant pdr contribution . in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we present three typical spectra from our sample dominated by uibs ( the disk of m82 ) , an hii continuum ( the nucleus of m82 ) as well as an agn ( the nucleus of ngc1068 ) . based on their position on our diagnostic diagram in figure [ fig6 ] , we estimate the corresponding fraction of mir templates according to the figure [ fig5]a .",
    "this is a first order approximation since we do not take explicitly into account the effects of the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption band on our template spectra .",
    "consequently , the observed difference between model and spectra in the range of 9 to 11@xmath0 m is probably due to the strong silicate extinction in embedded starbursts or agns .",
    "we do not attempt to model the emission from the [ neii](12.8@xmath0 m ) and [ neiii](15.6@xmath0 m ) lines which are independant of the dust emission properties .",
    "nevertheless , the overall agreement presented in figure [ fig7 ] is sufficient for modeling the general shape of spectra .    to extend our diagnostics in the case where spectra are not available , we present in figure [ fig8 ] the diagnostic diagram using broad band filtersm to match its equivalent lw3 filter to the isocam standard lw3(12 - 18@xmath0 m ) filter",
    ", we have normalized the transmission of the latter between 12 and 16@xmath0 m . ] .",
    "as expected , the agn candidates appear in the left part of this diagram . for lw3/lw2 ratios close to 1 , pdrs dominate the mir emission in our sample as it was the case for normal spiral galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for lw3/lw2 ratios between 1 and 6",
    ", both an agn and a star forming region signature may appear in our spectra ( e.g. the nucleus of ngc253 and ngc1068 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that the lw2/lw4 flux ratio is well adapted to estimate the presence of an agn contribution . for lw2/lw4 ratios",
    "lower than 1.5 , we clearly see that the mir emission is dominated by the agn whose strong continuum and nearly absent uibs , contribute to decrease this ratio . for larger lw2/lw4 ratios , emission is dominated either by quiescent star forming regions or by starburst regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . applying this criterion to the nucleus of m82",
    ", we clearly see that it is classified as a starburst while the nucleus of ngc1068 has a typical agn signature .",
    "athough this diagram uses only three broad band filters , the mir classification is in good agreement with results given by the diagnostic diagram based on full spectra ( see table [ sample ] ) .",
    "moreover , the diagnostic diagrams of figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] suggest that the well - known ultra - luminous galaxies such as iras 23128 - 5919 and ngc6240 have mir spectra which are overwhelmed by a strong starburst signature . in the `` super antennae '' ( iras 19254 - 7245 ) , which harbors a seyfert 2 nucleus ( @xcite ) , more than @xmath570@xmath8 of its mir flux originates from the agn ( @xcite )",
    ".    one can also use this technique to discover up to now unclassified agn hidden by a large column density of dust . such a candidate is arp236 ( ic1623 , vv114 ) , an infrared luminous system ( l@xmath31 = 10@xmath32 l@xmath3 ) , classified as an early - stage gas - rich merger ( m(h@xmath33 ) = 5.1@xmath710@xmath27 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) , and composed of several nuclei and/or compact starburst regions .",
    "previous near - infrared and radio studies showed no evidence for an agn ( @xcite , @xcite ) . however ,",
    "the mir signatures of the eastern region ( knot a , @xcite ) place it near the agn locus in our cvf diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) and , therefore , may contain a non - negligible fraction of agn contribution in its mir spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , one should note that the possible agn contribution in arp236 is not revealed with the lw diagnostic ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) which is less accurate compared to the cvf diagnostic .",
    "knot a is the brightest source in the near - infrared .",
    "it is also redder and more compact than all other sources in the system ( not resolved at 3.7@xmath0 m with a fwhm of 0.3arcsec , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath540@xmath8 of the mir emission in the region can originate from an optically obscured agn . a mir spectral classification based on our method",
    "is presented in the last column of table [ sample ] for all of our sample .",
    "our diagnostic diagrams provide a new tool allowing us to identify an agn or star formation ( starburst and/or quiescent star forming regions ) signature in the integrated mir spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "although self consistent , our method is based on data from a rather diverse sample .",
    "to further test its validity , we compared it with the mir diagnostics developed by genzel et al .",
    "( 1998a ) on a complete sample of ulirgs , using isophot - s . using the published mir spectra of the brightest sources in the genzel sample , we calculated the strength of the uib at 6.2@xmath0 m in these spectra , as well as the equivalent lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0m)/lw4(5.5 - 6.5@xmath0 m ) ratio since this is the principal discriminator between an agn and star forming regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the classification of galaxies obtained based on our method is in complete agreement with that of genzel et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "iras 23060 + 0505 , iras 19254 - 7245 , mrk 231 and mrk 273 , with an lw2/lw4 ratio of 1.16 , 1.36 , 1.42 and 1.60 respectively , are classified by both methods as galaxies containing a significant agn contribution in the mir .",
    "furthermore , in the wavelength range of isocam ( 5 - 16@xmath0 m ) , we can better constrain the nature of the continuum at 7@xmath0 m between dust and stellar contribution using the 14 - 15@xmath0 m flux , since the lw3(12 - 18@xmath0m)/lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) flux ratio is greater than 3 for the dust continuum found in agns or hii regions and less than 0.4 for the stellar continuum ( boselli et al . ( 1997 ) .",
    "we are also able to distinguish whether a featureless continuum is due to an agn or a pure hii region ( e.g. iizw40 ) .",
    "selective absorption by amorphous silicates , centered at 9.7 and 18 @xmath0 m , can play a crucial role in obscuring emission over much of the mir wavelengths .",
    "agns embedded in a large amount of dust could still remain undetected by our diagnostic . studying a sample of 28 seyfert 1 and 29 seyfert 2 with isophot - s , schulz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have already shown that the high absorption in seyfert 2 galaxies blocks a large fraction ( 90@xmath8 on the average ) of the mir continuum from the agn inner torus .",
    "they do detect the silicate feature in emission at 9.7@xmath0 m which is in favour of a moderately thick torus model ( a@xmath6@xmath5100 , @xcite ) and rules out models with very large optical depths ( a@xmath6@xmath51000 , @xcite ) . in our sample , among all nuclei ( diameter@xmath349@xmath35 ) which are classified as agns based on our mir diagnostics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , five nuclei are optically selected as seyfert 2 . provided sufficient spatial resolution is available , we can detect the hot dust continuum associated with the agn and we are able to disentangle its contribution to the mir emission of the galaxy . if those nuclei were observed with the isophot - s aperture of 24@xmath724arcsec@xmath36 , we would detect the presence of an agn only in the two nearest seyfert 2 of our sample ngc1068 , cena and in ngc6814 which is a seyfert 1 . the dilution effect combined with the optical depth of the agn torus would lead to an underestimation of the number of detected agns . the mir continuum associated with agns",
    "is not completely suppressed behind the dusty torus and may be observed using sufficient spatial resolution ( @xmath55arcsec ) observations on nearby galaxies ( d@xmath3450mpc with h@xmath37=75kms@xmath38mpc@xmath38 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of the agn continuum in seyfert 2 is also in better agreement with a dusty torus model producing moderate absorption ( a@xmath6@xmath5100 ) as in the model of granato et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    in figure [ fig10 ]",
    ", we note that the increase of the absorption in an agn spectrum leads to a decrease of the hot continuum used in our diagnostic .",
    "this further suggests that the `` true '' agn fraction would be underestimated and our detections must be considered as a lower limit .",
    "an intrinsically low agn contribution to the mir spectrum of a source would be difficult to distinguish from the star forming emission at 6 - 7@xmath0 m composed by uibs and the vsg continuum .",
    "consequently , we consider that an agn is detected by our diagnostic when the estimated fraction of the agn emission is larger than the contribution of starburst or quiescent star forming regions .",
    "recently several studies on the origin of the mir emission in galaxy clusters and deep field surveys were performed with isocam using the lw3 and lw2 broad band filters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our diagnostic implies that one can not discriminate between an agn and a starburst signature using just those two filters in the local universe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . at high redshifts , the two filter bandpasses sample shorter rest frame wavelength emission and are less sensitive to the vsg continuum . in figure",
    "[ fig11 ] , we applied a redshift correction on our mir templates at z=0.2 and z=0.4 , and we obtained the equivalent diagnostic diagrams derived from observations of nearby galaxies . to extrapolate the part of the spectrum under 5@xmath0 m , we use a power law for the agn template and a black - body continuum for the pure hii region template .",
    "we also assume that the pdr component under 5@xmath0 m is negligible ( @xcite ) . at z=0.4 , objects with lw3/lw2@xmath343 are classified as agn - dominant in the mir . for redshifts between 0.5 and 1 ,",
    "the lw3 filter samples mainly uibs ( lw2 at z=0 ) , while lw2 probes the hot dust emission between 3 and 5@xmath29 ( assuming that the stellar emission is negligible in spiral galaxies and only begins to be substantial below 2@xmath0 m ) .",
    "consequently , low values of the lw3/lw2 flux ratios in these surveys would suggest the presence of an agn .    in our diagnostic method",
    ", we have implicitly considered that the mir emission from the evolved stellar population is negligible in spiral galaxies .",
    "even though this may be true for galactic disks ( @xcite ) , extra caution is needed for bulges in the center of which one finds the agn . in that case , it is the rising slope of the mir spectrum which would reveal the presence of an agn , even though we can not rule out completely a possible faint contamination from evolved starlight at short wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the fact that the core radius of the bulge is several orders of magnitude larger than the region responsible for the `` hot continuum '' would in principle facilitate their separation in nearby galaxies .",
    "for distant galaxies where the integrated mir spectra include the whole galactic bulge , it is very difficult to estimate the form of the continuum below 6@xmath0 m .",
    "m83 , a well known starburst galaxy , is such an example , since we detect considerable continuum emission at 5 - 6@xmath0 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this emission is clearly extended outside the unresolved nuclear region and can be interpreted as stellar emission from the stellar bar ( cf .",
    "@xcite and sauvage priv .",
    "comm.)m could be used to estimate the contribution of the stellar emission observed at short mir wavelengths .",
    "a lw2/k or lw3/k flux ratio less than 1 would indicate a more important contribution from the stellar component . ] .",
    "furthermore , for distant galaxies the contribution of the star forming regions surrounding an agn would progressively enter in the beam and dilute the agn mir signatures .",
    "a more detailed discussion on this issue is presented in @xcite .",
    "our diagnostic method can be further expanded with the improved performance of upcoming telescopes , and can be used as a guide in scheduling future research programs .",
    "in addition to an increase in sensitivity , sirtf will provide better wavelength coverage ( 5 - 40 @xmath0 m ) than isocam , and better spatial resolution than the iso - sws observations .",
    "in particular , sirtf would provide a better measurement of the continuum for distant faint sources and , calculating the depth of both silicate absorption bands at 9.7 and 18 @xmath0 m , a more precise estimate for the absorption .",
    "an increase in spatial resolution would also permit a significant improvement in the agn / starburst diagnostics .",
    "both the infrared instruments installed on ground based 10 meter telescopes and the next generation space telescope which will cover the mir spectrum , will probe regions of @xmath510pcs near the agns , decreasing significantly the effects of beam dilution .",
    "using our isocam mir observations we have obtained a new agn / starburst diagnostic based on the strength of the uibs at 6.2@xmath0 m and the mir continuum .",
    "we conclude that :    \\1 ) in agn spectra ( even with a faint starburst contamination ) , a strong mir continuum is present at short wavelengths between 3 - 10@xmath0 m .",
    "this continuum may be attributed to very hot dust grains directly heated by the central engine .",
    "furthermore , the absence of uibs suggests that their carriers can be destroyed by the strong uv - x ray radiation field .",
    "\\2 ) our mir diagnostic diagrams can be used to unravel agns that are completely obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "for example , the nucleus of arp236 which was classified as a starburst galaxy triggered by an interaction is likely to contain an agn that contributes @xmath5 40@xmath8 to the mir flux .",
    "\\3 ) the emission from ultraluminous infrared galaxies can be dominated either by a starburst ( e.g. arp 220 ) or an agn ( e.g. the super antennae , iras 19254 - 7245 ) .",
    "nevertheless , an agn can remain partially hidden by the torus absorption even in the mir which may lead to an underestimate of its contribution to the whole spectral energy distribution .",
    "\\4 ) in the local universe , the lw3(12 - 18@xmath0m)/lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) ratio alone can not be used to distinguish agns from starbursts . however , for galaxies at z=0.4 - 1 , this ratio is effective in discriminating the agn from the starburst contribution .",
    "\\5 ) applications of adapted versions of our diagnostic in future instruments such as sirtf and ngst , which will sample the mir band with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than isocam , should provide better insights into the heating sources of the interstellar medium in galaxies .",
