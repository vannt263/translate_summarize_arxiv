    "the frequency of spectroscopic binaries ( sbs ) in star forming regions has been a topic of interest for many years .",
    "@xcite review the fraction of binary systems found among o stars in clusters / associations , the field , and runaway systems .",
    "the results from their large survey agree with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and indicate that a large fraction of o stars in clusters and associations are binaries while fewer field stars show multiplicity and very few runaway stars have companions .",
    "the values from @xcite are broken down into spectroscopic and resolved binaries . for o stars in clusters and associations",
    "they give a total of 75% as binaries ; 61% of the binaries are spectroscopic and 41% are resolved ( with some obvious overlap ) .",
    "the spectroscopic binary group includes , however , a significant number of cases labeled as sb1 ? or sb2 ? ( systems suspected of radial velocity variability or showing double lines ) ,",
    "so the fraction of confirmed spectroscopic binaries is then 34% among o stars in clusters and associations .",
    "we have conducted a radial velocity survey of o - type stars in the cas ob6 stellar association in search of spectroscopic binary systems .",
    "the cas  ob6 region is one of the largest complexes in the perseus arm of the galaxy and is located at a distance of about 2.3  kpc @xcite .",
    "the warm dust and ionized gas in this region extends over 150  pc along the arm and is dominated by the w3/w4/w5 chain of regions and the hb3 supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the open cluster ic  1805 ( ocl  352 = melotte 15 ) is situated at the western end in the w4 region and contains 8 o - type stars @xcite .",
    "the three brightest of these , hd  15558 , 15570 , and 15629 , are probably the ionization source that powers the blowout of gas in the galactic chimney @xcite and the emission arc above w4 @xcite .",
    "the open cluster ic  1848 ( ocl  364 ) is found in the eastern part of the association in the w5 region .",
    "its primary source of ionizing flux is the multiple o - star system hd  17505 @xcite .",
    "in addition to these two clusters , @xcite find evidence of 19 other young clusters that are still embedded in their primordial clouds .",
    "our knowledge of the binary star population among the young , massive stars of cas  ob6 is quite limited at present .",
    "there are a number of radial velocity investigations of the sample but the overall small number of measurements has made the detection of binary stars difficult @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic orbits are available for only three systems , hd  15558 @xcite , hd  16429 @xcite , and bd@xmath2 @xcite , while a fourth star , bd@xmath3 = dn  cas , is a known eclipsing binary @xcite .",
    "however , results for o - stars in other clusters and associations suggest that many more binaries may exist @xcite . it is important to determine the extent of the binary star population in cas  ob6 in order to estimate accurately the ionizing flux of the key o - type stars and to assess the role of gravitational encounters with binary stars that might lead to ejection of runaway stars @xcite .    here",
    "we present a reconnaissance of the radial velocity variations observed in 13 bright stars in cas  ob6 that we obtained over a 5 night run with the kpno 4  m mayall telescope in 2003 october .",
    "we also present the first radial velocity study of the eclipsing binary system dn  cas , which we combine with published photometry to determine the component masses .",
    "we discuss our observations and reduction techniques in  2 .",
    "the radial velocity measurements and the derivation of orbital elements are summarized in  3 .",
    "we use a tomography algorithm to separate the spectra of the binary star components , and we describe a comparison of the stellar spectra with model spectra in  4 that we use to estimate the basic stellar parameters . we examine in  5 the spectral energy distributions to determine reddening , ratio of total - to - selective extinction , and angular size for each target , and we discuss the probable distance to cas  ob6 . details about the individual objects follow in  6 .",
    "finally we summarize in  7 our derived fraction of multiple and single systems for cas  ob6 in the context of past results .",
    "the blue spectra were obtained with the rc spectrograph at the mayall 4  m telescope at kitt peak national observatory from 2003 september 30 through 2003 october 4 .",
    "the spectra were made with the bl  380 grating ( 1200 grooves mm@xmath4 , blazed at 4500   in second order ) using a bg39 order sorting filter .",
    "the detector was the t2 kb ccd , a @xmath5 device with 24 @xmath6 m square pixels .",
    "the spectra recorded wavelengths between 4180 and 4940   , although internal vignetting occurs for wavelengths red - ward of about 4800   .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion of the spectra is approximately 0.37   pixel@xmath4 , and the resolving power is @xmath7 .",
    "exposure times were usually a few minutes in length , and each stellar spectrum was preceded and followed by a he - ne - ar lamp exposure for careful wavelength calibration .",
    "most of the resulting spectra have a signal - to - noise ratio in excess of 100 pixel@xmath4 .",
    "we usually obtained at least two spectra of each target on each of five consecutive nights .",
    "we also made numerous bias and flat field frames each night .",
    "a list of the names of targets appears in table  1 .",
    "we also obtained an additional 32 spectra of hd  17505a with the kpno 0.9  m coude feed telescope in runs in 2000 october and 2000 december @xcite .",
    "the spectra were made with the long collimator , grating b ( in second order with order sorting filter og550 ) , camera 5 , and a ford @xmath8 ccd ( f3 kb ) detector .",
    "this arrangement produced a resolving power , @xmath9 , and covered a range of 829   around h@xmath10 .",
    "exposure times were 10  15 minutes , and the resulting spectra have a s / n = 200 in the continuum .",
    "we also observed the rapidly rotating a - type star , @xmath11  aql , which we used for removal of atmospheric water vapor lines .",
    "each set of observations was accompanied by numerous bias , flat field , and th  ar comparison lamp calibration frames .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard routines in iraf to create continuum rectified versions of each spectrum .",
    "then all the spectra of a given target were transformed to a common heliocentric frame in @xmath12 form and collected in a spectrum matrix of wavelength and time for subsequent analysis .",
    "the rectification of the vignetted portion of the spectrum was generally problem - free , so we used the entire spectral range in the following analysis .",
    "we found that the spectra of 10 of the 13 targets were composed of one set of spectral lines , and for these targets we obtained radial velocities by finding the extremum point of the cross - correlation of each spectrum with a spectrum template ( omitting those spectral regions containing interstellar features ) .",
    "we initially obtained velocities using the first spectrum as the template , and then we shifted each spectrum to the reference frame of the first spectrum and co - added all the spectra to form a high s / n template .",
    "the final relative velocities were then found by cross - correlation with this high s / n template spectrum .",
    "these relative velocities were then transformed to absolute velocity by adding the velocity measured in the template spectrum by fitting parabolae to the lower portions of selected spectral lines .",
    "rest wavelengths were taken from the list of @xcite .",
    "the final velocities for these 10 stars are listed in table  2 ( which appears only in the electronic version ) , and the mean velocity @xmath13 for each star is given in column 3 of table  1 .",
    "note that the adopted absolute velocity of the template spectrum depends critically on what subset of lines is measured because of the presence of significant line - to - line velocity differences",
    ". these differences mainly result from line formation at differing heights in an expanding stellar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we generally selected high excitation lines that form deep in the atmosphere where the outflow velocity is smallest ( see discussion of the individual targets in  6 ) .",
    "we list in column 4 of table  1 @xmath14 , the standard deviation of the measured velocity among different lines in the template spectrum .",
    "we used a version of the statistical @xmath15-test to determine if a star was a velocity variable object .",
    "since we usually obtained at least two spectra every night of each object and since we do not expect large variations in velocity over the time span of a few hours , we estimated the average measurement error from the mean of the absolute value of the differences within a night divided by @xmath16 .",
    "this spectrum - to - spectrum error estimate @xmath17 is given in column 5 of table  1 .",
    "we then compared this to the overall standard deviation of the velocities @xmath18 ( column 6 of table  1 ) , and set the criterion for variability as @xmath19 , which corresponds to the @xmath20 probability that both variances are drawn from the same population ( for 9 degrees of freedom = 10 observations minus 1 mean value ) .",
    "we found that three of the ten single - lined targets were velocity variable according to this criterion ( see the final column of table  1 ) .",
    "the stars hd  17520 and bd@xmath21 are probably long period binary systems while the very luminous star hd  15570 exhibits variations related to atmospheric structure fluctuations ( see the discussion in  6 ) .",
    "the spectra of the targets dn  cas and bd@xmath2 both showed evidence of line - doubling in some observations , and the spectra of hd  17505a displayed three components in the best separated cases .",
    "we were able to use a tomography algorithm to isolate the stationary line component in hd  17505a (  6.5 ) , and after removal of the stationary component the spectra were treated in the same way as for the other double - lined systems .",
    "we measured velocities for these double - lined binaries in a two - step process @xcite .",
    "preliminary radial velocities were found using the multiple gaussian fitting technique within the iraf splot routine . then preliminary orbital elements were determined that provided starting estimates of the velocities for both components in each spectrum .",
    "we then formed template spectra for both components by interpolating in the o - star synthetic spectrum grid of @xcite for a temperature and gravity appropriate for each star , and these were convolved with broadening functions to account for rotational and instrumental broadening (  4 ) .",
    "then we obtained velocities for specific spectral lines by a non - linear least squares fit of the observed profile with the two template spectra profiles co - added with a pre - defined monochromatic flux ratio ( details are given for each case in  6 ) .",
    "we took care to form an average velocity for each spectrum based on the same set of selected lines in order to avoid spurious variations introduced by line - to - line velocity differences .",
    "the resulting velocities are given below in  6 ( tables 4 , 6 , and 8) .",
    "we determined orbital elements for these three double - lined binaries using the non - linear , least - squares fitting routine of @xcite .",
    "the starting value for the orbital period was obtained with the period search technique of @xcite as modified by @xcite ( or from photometry in the case of dn  cas ) .",
    "we first solved for the best fit period and then we formed separate elliptical solutions for both the primary and secondary components .",
    "the derived eccentricity in the case of dn  cas was not significantly different from zero @xcite , but in the other two targets the eccentricity was significant and the same within errors in the solutions for the primary and secondary components .",
    "we formed average values of the eccentricity @xmath22 , longitude of periastron @xmath23 , and time of periastron @xmath24 that were then fixed in solutions to obtain the semiamplitude @xmath25 and systemic velocity @xmath26 for the primary and secondary components individually ( since differing atmospheric expansion rates may lead to different systemic velocities ) .",
    "the final orbital elements are given in  6 ( tables 5 , 7 , and 9 ) .",
    "we co - added our spectra to form high s / n versions for use in spectral classification , temperature and gravity estimation , and measurement of the projected rotational velocity @xmath27 .",
    "we used a simple shift - and - add algorithm to form an average spectrum in the case of the single - lined targets .",
    "however , we relied upon the doppler tomography algorithm described by @xcite to reconstruct the individual component spectra of the multiple component systems .",
    "the tomography algorithm is an iterative scheme that uses the derived orbital velocity shifts and monochromatic flux ratio to estimate the spectra of each component .",
    "we ran the algorithm for 50 iterations with a gain of 0.9 , although the results are insensitive to both parameters .",
    "the final , continuum rectified spectra of all our targets ( except hd  17505 ; see  6.5 ) and all their components are shown in figures  1 and 2 in order of decreasing effective temperature .",
    "we estimated the spectral classification of each target ( table 1 ) by comparing their spectra with standard star spectra in the atlas of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding stellar effective temperature @xmath28 was determined by comparing the equivalent widths of various / line ratios with those measured in the synthetic spectral library for o - stars by @xcite . in most cases",
    ", we simply assumed a surface gravity of @xmath29 as a suitable value for main sequence stars , but this approach was inadequate in several cases of evolved stars where the h balmer line wings are narrower and indicative of a lower gravity .",
    "we experimented with a number of model synthetic spectra to best estimate the gravity in these cases .",
    "this was accomplished through comparing models by eye with the data in order to find an appropriate match for surface gravity .",
    "the most difficult spectrum to match was that of the very luminous star hd  15570 , which displays clear evidence of the atmospheric expansion into a stellar wind that is not included in the static atmosphere formulation adopted by @xcite .",
    "we estimate that our fitting errors are approximately @xmath30  k in temperature and @xmath31 dex in @xmath32 , and the results are listed in table  1 .",
    "we estimated the projected rotational velocity @xmath27 by comparing the observed and line widths with those found by convolving the model profiles from @xcite with instrumental and rotational broadening functions .",
    "the instrumental broadening of our spectra was represented by a gaussian with @xmath33 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the rotational broadening function @xcite was computed assuming a spherical star with a linear limb - darkening coefficient determined from @xcite .",
    "a grid of theoretical profiles was computed for a range of @xmath27 , and a @xmath34 minimization was used to determine the best fit to the data .",
    "the results and errors are listed in table  1 .",
    "note that this approach does not account for variations in the intensity profile across the disk , nor the non - spherical shape and gravity darkening found in rapid rotators @xcite .",
    "these shortcomings are most important for the two rapid rotators in our sample , bd@xmath35 and bd@xmath21 , and we have probably underestimated the true rotational broadening in these cases .",
    "all of our targets are considered to be members of the cas  ob6 association based upon their position in the sky and placement in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) @xcite .",
    "the proper motion study of ic  1805 made by @xcite confirms membership for five targets but curiously indicates a somewhat discrepant proper motion for hd  15558 .",
    "we will assume that all the targets share a common distance , so their observed fluxes are directly related to their relative stellar radii .",
    "since we have determined temperature and multiplicity for each target , we have all parameters needed to estimate their radii as a function of distance by comparing their observed and model flux distributions , and we can then check the distance by comparing the derived and model radii ( as a function of temperature ) .",
    "the angular diameter of the limb darkened disk @xmath36 ( in units of radians ) is found by the inverse - square law : @xmath37 where the ratio of the observed and emitted fluxes ( reduced by the effects of interstellar extinction @xmath38 ) depends on the square of the ratio of stellar radius @xmath39 to distance @xmath40 .",
    "all our targets have a large reddening , so we need to fit the relation above over the entire observed spectrum in order to account reliably for the wavelength dependent shape of the extinction curve .",
    "we adopted the extinction curve law from @xcite that is a function of the reddening @xmath0 and the ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath1 .",
    "we then fit the observed flux distribution of each target to determine @xmath0 , @xmath41 , and angular diameter @xmath36 .",
    "we compiled data on the observed fluxes from the uv to the near - ir .",
    "there are low dispersion _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ spectra available ( swp and lwr cameras ) for all of the targets except dn  cas , hd  17520 , hd  237019 , and bd@xmath42 , and we formed binned versions of the uv spectral fluxes from these .",
    "we found johnson @xmath43 photometry for all the targets ( plus cousins @xmath44 in a few cases ) , and these magnitudes were transformed to fluxes using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "we also included strmgren photometry for 7 of the 13 targets using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "all of the stars are included in the _",
    "2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _",
    "@xcite , and we converted the @xmath45 magnitudes to fluxes using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "the model fluxes were selected from the grid of @xcite based upon the values of @xmath28 and @xmath32 in table  1 .",
    "these model fluxes are based upon plane - parallel , non - lte , line blanketed atmospheres that do not include the effects of stellar wind mass loss .",
    "however , the inclusion of winds generally alters the spectral energy distributions only at wavelengths much larger and much smaller than those considered here @xcite , so wind effects are insignificant in this context .",
    "we co - added model fluxes using the observed flux ratios for the spectroscopic binaries and using the observed magnitude difference for close visual binaries ( details are given in next section for individual stars ) .",
    "note that in the two single - lined binary cases , hd  17520 and bd@xmath21 , we simply assumed that the unseen companion contributes @xmath46 of the total flux ( a compromise between the expectation that the mass ratio is not too extreme and that brighter companions would have visible spectral features in our observations ) .",
    "we have no spectral information for some of the companions , and in these cases we assumed that the companion was a main sequence star with a temperature corresponding to the observed flux ratio ( from the calibration in table  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we set a lower limit of @xmath47  k and @xmath48 for the faint companions , which corresponds to the cool boundary in the grid of @xcite .",
    "this simplification is acceptable since any detected companion is probably hot enough that the optical and near - ir regions correspond to the common rayleigh - jeans portion of the flux distribution .",
    "we compared the observed and model flux distributions and made a grid search fit to find the values of @xmath0 and @xmath41 that produced the lowest @xmath49 residuals ( by weighting the observations approximately equally between the uv , optical , and near - ir bands ) .",
    "the normalization term in the final fit yields the angular diameter .",
    "our results are gathered in table [ sedfits ] which lists the star name , home cluster , angular diameter ( in micro - arcsec ) , derived radius ( see below ) , @xmath0 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the acccompaning error estimates for @xmath0 and @xmath41 are derived from the point in grid search where @xmath49 attains a value higher by 1 than normalized minimum value , and the errors in diameter are based upon the scatter in flux distribution fit and the errors propagated from uncertainty in @xmath28 , @xmath0 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the model fits were generally excellent , but they were less satisfactory for the spectra of the three hottest stars , where it was difficult to find a consistent match of the far- and near - uv fluxes .",
    "we also found the @xmath45 fluxes were too large relative to the optical fluxes for hd  17520 , which we suspect is due to an ir excess associated with the be disk emission of the companion @xcite , so the fit was based on the optical fluxes alone in this case .",
    "the stellar radius is found by @xmath50 where the distance @xmath40 is given in kpc .",
    "the distance estimates for ic  1805 and ic  1848 range from 1.9  kpc @xcite to 2.4  kpc @xcite ( with a scatter of @xmath51 among recent estimates ) .",
    "we selected a distance of @xmath52  kpc from the compendium of open cluster data by @xcite because this low end value appears to give the best match between the observed and theoretical stellar radii and provides good agreement with radii of similar stars in eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "the resulting radii are listed in table [ sedfits ] and are plotted against stellar temperature in figure [ figradt ] .",
    "there is a clear and consistent trend for the hotter main sequence stars to be larger , and the observations match the predictions for main sequence stars from the atmosphere models of @xcite ( shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ figradt ] ) .",
    "we also show in figure [ figradt ] the ( @xmath53 ) loci for stars with ages of 1.00 and 3.16  myr from the evolutionary models of @xcite , which correspond to the age range for ic  1805 given by @xcite .",
    "we see that most of the stars fall within the expected region in this diagram for this age range .",
    "however , the positions of several stars indicate that there is a real dispersion in the ages among this sample .",
    "for example , bd@xmath54 appears to have a relatively small radius for its temperature , indicating it is the youngest object in our sample .",
    "the derived stellar radii are directly proportional to the assumed distance , and , for example , if we adopted the larger distance @xmath55  kpc advocated by @xcite then the stars would be approximately @xmath56 larger , a size that would be difficult to reconcile with the evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "we show below that our derived radii for dn  cas agree well with those determined independently from an analysis of the eclipsing light curve .",
    "bd@xmath54. the two balmer lines h@xmath26 and h@xmath57 have the lowest measured velocities in the template spectrum , so they were omitted from the average ( i.e. , based only on the and lines ) .",
    "our observed mean velocity of @xmath58 km  s@xmath4 is reasonably consistent with the mean from the work of @xcite of @xmath59 km  s@xmath4 who also find the star to be a constant velocity object .",
    "hd 15558. there is evidence here for a velocity progression ( lower velocity among low excitation lines ) , so we used only the lines @xmath60 to set the radial velocity of the template spectrum .",
    "there are no obvious variations over the 5 night run , but the star may be a long period , single - lined binary @xcite . according to the recent orbital elements from @xcite , the orbital period is @xmath61  d and the predicted velocity at the mean time of our observations is @xmath62 km  s@xmath4 ( near the peak of the radial velocity curve ) , which is 27.7 km  s@xmath4 higher than our observed mean of @xmath63 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this discrepancy could be caused by differences in measurement techniques or errors in the preliminary orbital solution of @xcite .",
    "a long - term study by m.  de becker and g.  rauw ( 2005 , private communication ) has recently confirmed the binary status of this star and will provide an improved orbital solution .",
    "therefore , we list this star as `` constant ( sb1 ) '' in table [ summary ] denoting both a lack of short term line variability in our observations as well as the recent confirmation of binarity",
    ". there is a visual companion at a separation of @xmath64 that is 2.6  mag fainter @xcite .",
    "hd 15570. there is a clear velocity progression between spectral lines with the low excitation lines ( h , ) appearing at a much lower velocity than the high excitation lines ( , ) .",
    "there is also a correlation with line width in the sense that stronger , broader lines have lower velocity .",
    "we adopted a radial velocity for the template spectrum from the lines @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the night - to - night scatter between velocities is small except on the last night when the measured velocity is @xmath67 km  s@xmath4 more positive than the mean from the other nights .",
    "the of emission lines do not show any shift in velocity on the final night .",
    "we suspect that the change was related to an atmospheric fluctuation rather than orbital motion .",
    "@xcite also consider this star to be a velocity variable .",
    "@xcite find no evidence of orbital motion and discuss rotational modulation as a possible source of line variability .",
    "hd 15629. the low excitation balmer and lines have systematically low velocities , so the template mean was adopted from the lines @xmath68 .",
    "we find no evidence of velocity variability .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , flag this star as possibly variable , but given the presence of line - to - line velocity differences , some of the velocity differences found by various authors are probably due to the line sample adopted ( and not to orbital motion ) .",
    "@xcite also find no evidence of orbital motion for this star .",
    "bd@xmath69. this star has a broad - lined spectrum , and we selected only the strongest lines to measure the template mean velocity ( h@xmath26 , h@xmath57 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "we confirm the lack of short term velocity variability reported by @xcite , and our mean velocity of @xmath72 km  s@xmath4 is probably consistent with their mean value , @xmath73 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "bd@xmath74. the h@xmath57 line had the lowest velocity measured , so we omitted the h balmer lines and weak lines in forming the template mean velocity .",
    "the star appears to be radial velocity constant over the run , and our mean velocity , @xmath75 km  s@xmath4 , is probably consistent with that from @xcite of @xmath76 km  s@xmath4 .",

    "the star has a constant radial velocity over the run .",
    "our mean velocity of @xmath77 km  s@xmath4 is higher than the only other value in the literature of @xmath78 km  s@xmath4 from @xcite .",
    "bd@xmath42. we omitted h@xmath57 and @xmath79 from the template mean calculation , since both lines had significantly lower velocities .",
    "the star was radial velocity constant during the run .",
    "our mean velocity , @xmath80 km  s@xmath4 , agrees with that found by @xcite , @xmath81 km  s@xmath4 , but is lower than the value reported by @xcite , @xmath82 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the star is a member of a visual multiple system ( ads  2194 ) with companions at separations of @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "hd 17520. the h@xmath57 line has a blue - shifted emission component which also appears weakly in h@xmath26 .",
    "the balmer lines and weak lines were omitted in the calculation of the template mean velocity .",
    "the velocities show a progressive increase over the duration of the run , reaching values similar to those observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed how h@xmath10 emission developed between 1985 and 1991 leading to a spectral classification as a be - type star ( probably its status in 2003 as well since the emission is so apparent in h@xmath57 ) .",
    "this star is also the central object in a visual multiple system ( ads  2165 ) with a close companion at a separation of @xmath87 and with a magnitude difference of 0.52  mag @xcite .",
    "our spectra show evidence of only one set of lines ( for the o9  v component ) , and unfortunately , we do not know if the be emission originates in the o - star or its nearby companion ( which could have broad shallow lines as observed in many be stars ) .",
    "we note that over the course of the run the h@xmath57 emission appeared to be almost stationary while the absorption lines shifted red - ward by @xmath88 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that the o - star component is a long - period , single - lined binary , while the be emission originates in the fainter component of the close visual pair .",
    "there is another star at a separation of @xmath89 that is 3.2 mag fainter in @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "bd@xmath21. we used the strong lines to set the template mean velocity for the broad - lined spectrum of this star .",
    "the first measured velocity is close to the value obtained by @xcite , @xmath90 km  s@xmath4 , but the subsequent velocities decline monotonically by @xmath91 km  s@xmath4 over the next 4 days .",
    "this suggests that the star is a single - lined binary with a period of @xmath92  d and a semiamplitude of @xmath93 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "dn cas has been known as an eclipsing binary for some time and was classified as an algol type binary with a period of 1.155479 d by @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified the spectrum as o8  v. a later photometric study by @xcite used @xmath43 photoelectric photometry to refine the orbital period to 2.310955 d , twice that of the original value . unfortunately , the comparison star used by @xcite turned out to be itself an eclipsing binary , compromising their final photometry .",
    "@xcite made another photometric study , and based upon the curvature near the maxima of the light curve he reclassified dn  cas as a @xmath57  lyrae type system .",
    "interestingly no spectroscopic observations of dn  cas have appeared in the literature , though @xcite claimed that such observations were underway .",
    "additionally , the only photometry that has been published , other than in phase - folded figures , is the compromised data of @xcite .",
    "this overlooked opportunity to obtain masses for this massive binary is rectified here , where we present the first full orbital solution based on our spectroscopy and photometry from the literature .",
    "we determined velocities for both components using non - linear least - squares fits of two templates with temperatures and rotational velocities given in table  [ summary ] and with a monochromatic flux ratio in the blue of @xmath94 .",
    "our final radial velocities are given in table [ dncasrv ] and the spectroscopic orbital elements are given in table [ dncasorb ] .",
    "the period was adopted from the eclipse timing observations collected by @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the time of minimum light ( primary superior conjunction ) to set the zero - point of orbital phase and epoch @xmath95 , and our derived epoch agrees with the current photometric epoch of minimum light from @xcite of hjd 2,452,501.928 @xmath96 .",
    "eccentric fits offered no significant improvement over circular fits @xcite , so circular elements are given in table  5 .",
    "the radial velocities and orbital solutions are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the only published photometric data of dn  cas are those from @xcite who made @xmath43 photoelectric observations between 1971 october and 1972 december .",
    "unfortunately , their comparison star , hd  14817 , is itself an eclipsing binary as mentioned above .",
    "however , the light curve of hd  14817 from _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite is flat outside of eclipse , so we can retain the results from @xcite that are based on outside - of - eclipse times for hd  14817 .",
    "these measurements are plotted against orbital phase in figure  5 , and because there remain significant phase gaps in this restricted set , our light curve fitting results should be considered preliminary .",
    "we calculated a model light curve using the wilson - devinney code @xcite .",
    "most of the model parameters are set by the spectroscopic orbital solution ( table  [ dncasorb ] ) , the adopted temperatures and gravities from the spectra ( table  [ summary ] ) , the associated limb darkening parameters @xcite , and the monochromatic flux ratio ( which sets the ratio of the mean stellar radii ) .",
    "in addition , we set the bolometric albedo and gravity darkening exponents to 1.0 , which are valid approximations for stars with fully radiative envelopes .",
    "we then fit the observed @xmath97-band observations by varying the inclination @xmath98 and the stellar radii .",
    "the ratio of stellar radii was set using the observed monochromatic flux ratio and model surface flux ratio ( set according to the temperatures and gravities in table  1 ) @xmath99^{0.5 } = 0.72 \\pm 0.09.\\ ] ] if the stars are rotating synchronously , then the ratio of projected rotational velocities also yields the ratio of radii as @xmath100 and the good agreement between these two estimates suggests that synchronous rotation has been attained in this close binary .",
    "we found that the radii obtained from a fit of the spectral energy distribution and distance of 1.9  kpc ( table [ sedfits ] ) led to an excellent fit of the light curve for an orbital inclination of @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "5 ) , and the derived stellar masses are @xmath102 for the o8  v primary and @xmath103 for the b0.2  v secondary ( table  5 ) .",
    "the mass of the primary is consistent with its spectral type for the calibration given by @xcite , and the mass of the secondary agrees well with the mass for its spectral type according to the relations given by @xcite .",
    "both stars are well within their respective roche lobes .",
    "there is a companion to dn  cas in the 2mass catalogue at a separation of @xmath104 and at a position angle of @xmath105 .",
    "however , inspection of the 2mass images at this position suggests that this object is probably not a real star since its point spread function looks very sharp and unlike those of nearby stars .",
    "furthermore , we see no evidence of such a tertiary in our observations .",
    "since the near east - west alignment of the putative object and dn  cas is the same as the slit orientation for our kpno 4  m spectra , the tertiary should appear in our spectra with a separation from dn  cas of 7.7 pixels in the spatial dimension .",
    "the average 2mass magnitude difference is 2.13 mag ( for @xmath106 ) , so that the flux ratio of tertiary to binary is 0.14 in the near - ir .",
    "however , our blue spectra show no sign of a companion brighter than @xmath107 , so if this companion is real , it is probably a very red foreground star that can be ignored in our analysis .",
    "we found that the introduction of a third light contribution of @xmath108 in the @xmath97-band light curve results in an increase in the inclination by @xmath109 , but since the actual flux contribution of a tertiary is probably much smaller than this , any changes in our results due to the presence of a tertiary are probably comparable to or less than the errors quoted in table  5 .",
    "the spectra of bd+@xmath111497 show clear evidence that this star is a double - lined spectroscopic binary . in their recent paper ,",
    "@xcite give the first orbital solution for bd+@xmath111497 , and they find an orbital period of 3.96 days .",
    "we measured velocities using the scheme outlined in  3 by matching template synthetic profiles for models with temperatures and gravities given in table  1 , together with an estimated flux ratio of @xmath112 .",
    "we note , however , that in some of the lines ( for example , @xmath113 ) we found that the approaching , blue - shifted component ( primary and secondary ) often appeared to be weaker than expected based upon this fixed flux ratio ( @xcite also observed a similar variation ) .",
    "we doubt that this variation has a significant effect on our measurements , which appear in table  6 .",
    "we combined our velocities with those of @xcite in making the orbital solution .",
    "a number of alias periods remain viable , but we obtained the best fit with a period close to that obtained by @xcite ( see table  7 ) .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , we found that a significant eccentricity is present , and we made full elliptical fits for both components .",
    "otherwise our results are in reasonable agreement with their solution ( compared in table  7 ) .",
    "the velocities and orbital fit are shown folded on the derived ephemeris in figure  6 .",
    "assuming masses typical of their spectral classes @xcite , the system probably has an inclination of @xmath114 , so we do not expect eclipses to occur .",
    "the star system hd  17505 dominates the center of the cluster ic  1848 , and there are seven visual companions noted by @xcite at distances ranging from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "multiplicity in the central object hd  17505a has been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and it is known to contain at least three stars since the single _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "spectrum shows evidence of three doppler shifted components @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the multiplicity of the star is the reason it appears so bright in the hrd .",
    "we obtained 10 spectra of hd  17505a over the five night duration of the kpno 4  m run , and we found that the lines were strongly blended in all but a few spectra corresponding to the maximum doppler separation of the binary motion .",
    "however , we also obtained an additional 32 red spectra of the target in 2000 with the kpno 0.9  m coude feed telescope (  3 ) , and these turned out to be particularly helpful in finding the orbital elements .",
    "initial inspection of these higher dispersion red spectra showed that all three components were cleanly resolved in the profiles observed near orbital quadrature phases and indicated an orbital period of approximately 8  days .",
    "we measured radial velocities by first making unconstrained three - gaussian fits of the least blended feature , @xmath117 , in the quadrature phase spectra .",
    "we obtained a preliminary orbital solution from this subset of spectra for the two moving components , and then we used this solution to estimate the doppler shifts for all the coude feed observations .",
    "then we made three - component gaussian fits of @xmath117 in all the red spectra using these starting estimates for the doppler shifts and constraining the widths to be the mean values found from the fits of the quadrature phase spectra .",
    "a new orbital solution was obtained , and the solution was used to make a three component reconstruction of the individual component spectra using the doppler tomography algorithm @xcite .",
    "we subtracted the reconstructed spectrum of the stationary component from each spectrum and renormalized them to end up with a set corresponding to the spectra of the double - lined binary alone .",
    "we then measured the radial velocities using the non - linear , least - squares method by matching template spectra to the profiles of h@xmath10 , @xmath118/ @xmath119 , and @xmath117 .",
    "the template spectra for the two components were taken from their respective tomographic reconstructions ( @xmath120 ) rather than using the model profiles from @xcite , because we were concerned that some of these red features are not well represented by the synthetic models .",
    "this approach worked well except in one conjunction phase observation ( from hjd  2,451,892.743 ) where the lines were too badly blended for reliable measurement .",
    "our final radial velocities from the red spectra for the close binary are collected in table [ 17505rv ] .",
    "the estimate for the orbital period from the red spectra alone was @xmath121  d , and the error was sufficiently small that we could determine the cycle number and approximate orbital phase corresponding to the times of the kpno 4  m observations in 2003 october .",
    "we measured the line width of the @xmath122 feature in these blue spectra to find that maximum velocity separation occurred at hjd  2,452,915.469 @xmath123 , and we compared this to the time of the same orbital phase for the 2000 coude feed observations to arrive at a revised period estimate of @xmath124  d. the final orbital solution is given in table  9 and the radial velocity curve appears in figure  7 .",
    "the predictions from this fit for the time of the _ iue _ observation are @xmath125 and @xmath126 km  s@xmath4 , in reasonable agreement with the observed velocities of @xmath127 and @xmath128 km  s@xmath4 @xcite , but we did not include the _ iue _ measurements in the final solutions because of possible systematic differences between velocities measured in the uv and optical .",
    "we made tomographic reconstructions of both the blue and red spectra using the orbital solution in table [ 17505orb ] and assuming flux contributions of 30% , 30% , and 40% for aa1 , aa2 , and ab , respectively ( based upon the relative equivalent widths of the @xmath118 @xmath129 @xmath119 feature ) .",
    "both the blue and red spectral reconstructions are plotted in figure [ 17505spec ] .",
    "we determined radial velocities of the stationary component ab of @xmath130 and @xmath131 from the blue and red reconstructed spectra , respectively . once again",
    ", the optical velocities are systematically more negative than the uv determined value for ab of @xmath132 km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in a schematic representation of the system hierarchy in figure [ 17505mob ] .",
    "note that the coude feed spectra were made with a @xmath133 wide slit in an approximately north - south orientation , so the b component ( at a separation of @xmath134 and a position angle of @xmath135 with a magnitude difference of @xmath136 mag ; @xcite ) may be slightly mixed in with the light from the ab component for the red reconstructed spectrum .",
    "however , the 4  m spectra were made with an east - west slit orientation , so it was possible to separate the a and b components spatially along the slit .",
    "a single extracted spectrum of the b component is shown in figure [ 17505spec ] along with the tomographic reconstructions of the aa1 , aa2 , and ab components .",
    "the spectrum of the b component is clearly different and indicates a cooler effective temperature than the stars of component a , and , thus , the spectroscopic triple we detect is clearly related to a alone .",
    "the hottest and brightest of all the components is ab , and its spectral type agrees with that obtained by @xcite for the entire system .",
    "the stars of the aa1-aa2 central binary are far enough apart that no eclipses should be seen , and indeed none are observed @xcite .",
    "for example , if we adopt the masses and radii associated with o - type main sequence stars from @xcite , then the expected system inclination should be @xmath137 ( based upon the @xmath138 values in table  [ 17505orb ] ) while eclipses would be observed only if @xmath139 ( based upon the semimajor axis in table  [ 17505orb ] ) . the orbital period of b around the triple a can be estimated as @xmath140  y if we take the projected angular separation as the semimajor axis and the distance is 1.9  kpc .",
    "the orbital period of the aa - ab central triple is probably much less .",
    "the system was unresolved in the speckle survey of @xcite , and if we take their resolution limit of 35  mas as the projected semimajor axis then the orbital period should be @xmath141  y. the target is clearly worthy of continued spectroscopic and interferometric observation to search for evidence of such orbital motion .",
    "we have monitored thirteen o stars in the cas  ob6 association in search of multiple star systems .",
    "five of the thirteen were found to have radial velocity variations related to orbital motion .",
    "of these five , we have determined orbital solutions for three double - lined systems : the eclipsing binary dn  cas , bd@xmath2 , and the spectroscopic triple hd  17505a .",
    "the remaining two binaries , bd@xmath21 and hd  17520 , are single - lined binaries with periods longer than 5 days .",
    "in addition to these five , one of our targets , hd  15558 , is probably a long period binary @xcite .",
    "one other bright o - star in cas  ob6 is hd  16429 , which was found by @xcite to be a spectroscopic triple . if we include all of these objects in the known sample of observed o - stars in the cas  ob6 association , then we find that 7 of the 14 , or @xmath142 , are spectroscopic binaries .",
    "this value is well within the range found by @xcite for spectroscopic binaries among stars in clusters and associations .",
    "we note that two systems , hd  17505 and dn  cas , are of special interest and would benefit from follow - up observations .",
    "we are planning to obtain new three - color photometry of the eclipsing binary dn  cas in order to make a better fit of the light curve and to determine an accurate mass of the o8  v primary star .",
    "the multiple system hd  17505 is a fascinating system with at least four o stars ( with a total mass close to @xmath143 ) which are apparently gravitationally bound .",
    "high resolution studies via interferometry to separate the aa and ab components would produce a more accurate kinematic model for the system and would help us better understand stellar interactions in these systems and their role in the formation and ejection of massive stars .",
    "we are grateful to the director and staff of kpno for their help in making these observations possible .",
