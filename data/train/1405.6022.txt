    "this approach is limited to interrogation times where the accumulated phase fluctuations are smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that during the interferometry sequence the shot - to - shot fluctuations of the offset field translate 140 times stronger into detuning fluctuations than during the generation procedure of the squeezed states , as the levels @xmath10 and @xmath91 are linearly sensitive to magnetic field changes ."
