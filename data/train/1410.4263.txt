    "radial velocity , transit , and imaging methods have enabled the discovery of a variety of exoplanets ranging from hot super earths to cold jupiters , including confirmed terrestrial exoplanets within the habitable zone ( hz ; @xcite ) around low - mass stars . for giant and terrestrial planets alike , incident stellar emission at short wavelengths ( @xmath1 3000 ) affects the chemistry and evolution of an exoplanet s atmosphere .",
    "in particular , it is the high energy of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation that controls the processes of molecular photodissociation and photoionization in the planetary atmosphere ( @xcite ) , breaking apart important molecules such as water , methane and carbon dioxide , and potentially leading to significant mass loss .",
    "the possibility of complete evaporation of the planet atmosphere due to high uv ( and corresponding particle ) flux may explain the high fraction of hot dense planets around cool stars in the current exoplanet population ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the case of hz planets , the incident uv stellar flux may also destroy biosignatures",
    "with which we hope to detect life , and/or produce false - positive biosignatures in the form of abiotic oxygen and ozone @xcite .",
    "much of the stellar uv flux is emitted from the upper - atmospheres of fgkm stars , namely the chromosphere , transition region and corona , and measurements at these short wavelengths require space - borne observatories and stars that are bright and not too distant from earth .",
    "the fuv spectrum is dominated by lyman  @xmath0 , the resonance line of hydrogen at 1216  , which is emitted from the upper - chromosphere and lower - transition region temperatures of roughly 8000 to 30000 k @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently highlighted the potential importance of the lyman  @xmath0  emission line to the atmospheres of close - in planets .",
    "for example , the sun s lyman  @xmath0   contributes @xmath220% of the total flux between 1 to 1700   @xcite , and is shown to be responsible for more than 50% of the photodissociation rate of the earth s h@xmath3o and ch@xmath4 .",
    "lyman  @xmath0 s fractional flux increases for cooler stars as the photospheric contribution decreases ( fig .",
    "[ teff_phot ] , right ) and can reach up to @xmath270% of the total fuv flux for late m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in addition to the observational difficulties , predicting stellar uv flux from low - mass stars is also challenging since current models were not designed to calculate emission from the low - density regions of stellar upper - atmospheres . as a result , the uv flux received by an exoplanet is often underestimated in photochemical models @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated the significant impact of a star s lyman  @xmath0  on the photochemistry of the atmospheres of mini - neptunes at low pressures using the gj 436 planetary system , one of the few m dwarfs for which lyman  @xmath0  data exist @xcite .",
    "the total lyman  @xmath0  emission is impossible to measure directly from stars due to scattering of the majority of the photons by the neutral hydrogen of the interstellar medium . even for the nearest stars it is difficult to directly determine the lyman  @xmath0  flux without using reconstruction techniques applied to high - resolution spectra currently available only with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "s ( _ hst _ ) _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( _ stis _ ) and _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( _ cos _ ) . complicating the measurement",
    "further , one also has to take into account earth s own geocoronal lyman  @xmath0  emission .    using reconstructions from @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "@xcite produced correlations of lyman  @xmath0  line fluxes from a sample 46 fgkm stars with other spectral emission lines formed in the chromosphere , which were also observed with either _ stis _  or _",
    "cos_. although the mg ii h+k emission lines at 2802.7 and 2795.5   also required a correction for interstellar absorption at their cores @xcite , they provided the most promising results possibly due to being least affected by metallicity differences . even with large uncertainties in the lyman  @xmath0  reconstructed fluxes , @xmath520% for the fgk stars @xcite and @xmath530% for the m stars @xcite ,",
    "the search for correlations between different activity diagnostics and lyman  @xmath0  is extremely valuable when no other uv spectral data are available .    in view of the severe challenges of measuring or predicting lyman  @xmath0  and mg  ii for many stars",
    ", we used _",
    "the galaxy evolution explorer _ s ( _ galex _ ) all - sky photometric surveys to search for correlations between fuv and nuv photometry and the intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  and mg  ii fluxes compiled by @xcite . in the absence of uv spectroscopy",
    ", such correlations will allow for estimates of the intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  fluxes from thousands of stars within a few hundred parsecs in the _ galex _  archive with which to study stellar activity , provide empirical constraints for new cool - star upper - atmosphere models ( s.  peacock et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and estimate the incident high - energy radiation affecting the photochemisty and evolution of planetary atmospheres .",
    "the _ galex _  satellite was launched on 2003 april 28 and observed the uv sky until its mission completion on 2013 june 28 .",
    "_ galex _  imaged approximately 3/4 of the sky simultaneously in two uv bands : fuv 13501750   and nuv 17502750  , excluding the powerful and complicated lyman  @xmath0  and nominally sensitive to the mg ii h+k chromospheric lines .",
    "the average fwhm of the psfs are 6.5  and 5  in the fuv and nuv , respectively , across a 1.25@xmath6 field of view .",
    "the full description of the instrumental performance is presented by @xcite . with the failure of the fuv detector in 2009 may , subsequent observations only provided nuv imaging .",
    "the fluxes and magnitudes averaged over the entire exposure were produced by the standard _",
    "galex _  data analysis pipeline ( ver .  4.0 ) operated at the caltech science operations center @xcite .",
    "the current database contains 214,449,551 source measurements ( bianchi 2013 ) recorded by the all - sky , medium and deep imaging surveys and many guest investigator programs .",
    "the data products are archived at the barbara a. mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .    for this study we used the `` aper_7 '' aperture for the uv photometry , which has a radius of 17.3 .",
    "this large aperture requires the least aperture correction ( 0.04 mags in both the in nuv and fuv bandpasses ) and accounts for all possible point spread functions , even those elongated near the edges of the images .",
    "we excluded detections beyond 0.59@xmath7 from the center of the image to avoid the worst edge effects .",
    "for f and g stars , the flux in the _ galex _  bandpasses includes a significant fraction of continuum ( i.e.  photospheric ) emission ( fig .",
    "[ teff_phot ] , right ; @xcite ) with the remaining flux provided by strong emission lines ( c iv , c ii , si iv , he ii ) originating from the stellar upper - atmosphere . k and m stars have fuv and nuv fluxes strongly dominated by these stellar emission lines making _ galex _  an excellent tool with which to study stellar activity in lower - mass stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "twenty - eight of the stars with reconstructed lyman  @xmath0  fluxes compiled by @xcite were observed by _",
    "galex_. these are summarized in table  [ table_targets ] .",
    "_ galex _",
    "observations move into the non - linear regime after 34 counts  s@xmath8 in the fuv and 108 counts  s@xmath8 in the nuv @xcite . this required us to omit all the bright stars with effective temperatures  @xmath9 4900 k from the nuv analysis and one nearby k star from the fuv analysis .",
    "one m star has an fuv flux below the detection threshold and we calculate its 1-sigma upper limit using figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "this left eight stars with nuv detections and nineteen stars with fuv detections for analysis .",
    "@xcite compiled the spectral types ( spts ) , distances , and reconstructed lyman  @xmath0  and mg  ii fluxes scaled to 1 au of 46 stars .",
    "table  [ table_targets ] lists the 28 of these stars observed by _",
    "galex_. we scaled the fluxes to the stellar surface using radii derived from the @xcite models with published stellar ages from the literature and  from @xcite for the given spt .",
    "as mentioned above , the _ galex _  bandpasses consist of both photospheric and chromospheric emission .",
    "we determined photospheric emission from stellar atmosphere models , which by design exclude chromospheric emission , to isolate the excess flux originating solely from upper - atmospheric activity .",
    "we adopt the semi - empirical results from @xcite who calculated _ galex _  fuv and nuv magnitudes of the photospheric fluxes for b8 to k5 stars using the solar - metallicity kurucz models and applied  corrections to fit empirical color - color plots .",
    "( see their table 1 and figure 5 . ) for stars cooler than k5 , we use the phoenix model atmospheres ( @xcite ) convolved with the relevant nuv and fuv normalized transmission curves .",
    "( see section  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "[ teff_phot ] ( left ) plots the surface photospheric flux for our sample as a function of : the @xcite fluxes for stars hotter than 4000 k and phoenix model fluxes for cooler stars .",
    "the tight correlation between the two photospheric flux sources demonstrates their consistency .",
    "in both the nuv and fuv detections of our sample , 80% of the targets have photospheric contributions of @xmath1010% of the observed flux .",
    "only one hot star at = 6800 k appears to have nearly no chromospheric emission .",

    "all but one of the k and m stars have negligible photospheric contributions .",

    "although in most cases the expected photospheric flux is relatively low , we subtract it from the _ galex _",

    "thus , any uncertainties in the models used will not disrupt the results for the k and m stars , as it might for the hotter stars .",

    "( 3 ) and , with k and m stars being the most favorable for followup studies of hz planets ( e.g.  @xcite ) , a separate correlation for these stars is appropriate for providing lyman  @xmath0  and mg  ii flux estimates with which to study planetary atmospheres .",

    "[ uv_lya ] ( right ) shows the correlation for the lyman  @xmath0  surface flux against the nuv excess surface flux with a strong correlation of @xmath11=0.94 for eight k and m stars .",
    "due to the brightness of the f and g stars , no nuv observations were reliable due to the non - linearity of the _ galex _  data .",
    "@xcite pointed out that of all the emission lines they studied , mg ii may provide the most accurate lyman  @xmath0  predictions as metallicity effects appear the smallest .",

    "all of the regression fits to the correlations are summarized in table  [ table_coef ] .",
    "lyman  @xmath0  is the strongest stellar uv emission line and provides the most important source of radiative losses in a star s upper - chromosphere and lower - transition region . as such",
    ", it may also be the greatest source of molecular photodissociation in the atmosphere of an orbiting exoplanet .",
    "measuring a star s intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  flux requires space - based high - resolution fuv spectroscopy plus intricate reconstruction techniques to correct for interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission . in order to gain access to the lyman  @xmath0  emission of many more stars than is currently possible to observe ( i.e.  with _ hst _ )",
    ", we sought to find correlations between literature values of reconstructed lyman  @xmath0  emission and broadband stellar upper - atmospheric emission measured from _",
    "galex _  fuv and nuv photometry .",
    "our sample consisted of the 28 stars which have both reconstructed lyman  @xmath0  and _ galex _  observations ranging in spt from f5 to m5.5 .",
    "we separated our sample into 11 f and g stars and 17 k and m stars as the photospheric contribution to the _ galex _  bandpasses , stellar variability , and chromospheric temperature structure ( e.g.  @xcite ) differ in the two groups . the f and g stars",
    "were limited to only eight fuv observations as they were too bright for reliable nuv measurements .",
    "there is a weak correlation between the fuv excess flux and lyman  @xmath0 , and a strong one between _ galex_/fuv and the mg ii doublet , the strongest emission feature in the nuv spectral region .",
    "however , with the few data points for f and g stars , their small flux distribution , and uncertainties in the model fluxes , these correlations should be applied cautiously .",
    "for the sample of k and m stars where the photospheric model fluxes are negligible , we find that the lyman  @xmath0  surface fluxes correlate well with both the fuv and nuv excess surface fluxes such that log [ @xmath12 = ( 0.43 @xmath13 0.07 ) * log [ @xmath14 + ( 3.97 @xmath13 0.36 ) and log [ @xmath12 = ( 0.45 @xmath13 0.07 ) * log [ @xmath15 + ( 3.55 @xmath13 0.41 ) . for stars too bright in the nuv",
    ", the fuv correlation can be used , and for more distant stars where the fuv is not detected , the nuv correlation can be used .",
    "additionally , the _ galex _  excess fluxes for k and m stars correlate well with the mg ii lines providing another window into a strong stellar chromospheric emission feature probing lower emission temperatures .    with good correlations in both _ galex _",
    "bandpasses , estimates of intrinsic lyman  @xmath0  and mg ii can now be made for thousands of k and m stars out to a few hundred parsecs from earth .",
