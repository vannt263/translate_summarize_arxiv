    "quantum cryptography utilizes the original characteristics of quantum mechanics such as superposition , entanglement and so on . using these properties",
    ", some information can be secretly shared between users through a quantum channel .",
    "the information can be a key or a message .",
    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols are used to share a key and quantum direct communication ( qdc ) protocols are employed to send a message .",
    "many qkd protocols have been proposed since bennett and brassard first proposed a quantum key distribution protocol@xcite in 1984 .",
    "the security of some qkd protocols was theoretically proven in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "qdc starts to be researched nowadays .",
    "first qdc protocol was proposed by beige et al.@xcite in 2002 .",
    "it was followed by other qdc protocols@xcite .    in most qdc protocols except two protocols proposed by beige et al .",
    "@xcite and deng et al .",
    "@xcite , the receiver(bob ) must begin the protocol to get a secret message from the sender(alice ) .",
    "for example bob should generate single photons@xcite or bell states@xcite or qutrit states@xcite and transmit all or some part of them to alice .",
    "in addition , most qdc protocols are vulnerable to the man in the middle attack .",
    "we propose two qdc protocols , which combine user authentication and direct communication in quantum world at first time . to authenticate users , an authentication method proposed in @xcite",
    "is introduced .",
    "after authentication alice can send a secret message directly to bob .",
    "this message may not be leaked to a third party . moreover",
    "alice and bob can communicate without a quantum link between them in our second qdc protocol .",
    "we present our qdc protocols in the chapter 2 , then analyze the security of them in chapter 3 and make conclusions in chapter 4 .",
    "our quantum direct communication protocols are composed of two parts : one is an authentication and the other a direct communication .",
    "the third party , trent is introduced to authenticate the users participating in the communication .",
    "he is assumed to be more powerful than other users and he supplies the greenberger - horne -zeilinger ( ghz ) states@xcite .",
    "user s secret identity sequence and a one - way hash function are known to trent .",
    "this information must be kept secret between the user and the arbitrator .",
    "suppose alices(bob s ) identity sequence and her(his ) one - way hash function are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "for example , a one - way hash function is @xmath2 , where * is arbitrary length , @xmath3 the length of a counter and @xmath4 a fixed number . alices(bob s ) authentication key shared with trent can be calculated as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the counter of calls on alices(bob s ) hash functions .",
    "authentication keys are used to determine unitary operations on ghz particles heading from the arbitrator to the owner .",
    "users can authenticate each other by checking the correlation of the ghz states taken the reverse unitary operations .",
    "if alice wants to send a secret message to bob , she notifies this fact to bob and trent . on receiving the request ,",
    "trent generates @xmath7 ghz tripartite states @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    "the following ghz state @xmath9 is supposed to be prepared . @xmath10",
    "where the subscripts a , t and b correspond to alice , trent , and bob , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we represent the z basis as @xmath11 and the x basis as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "next , trent encodes alice s and bob s particles of ghz states with their authentication keys , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "for example , if the @xmath17th value of @xmath18 is 0 , then trent makes an identity operation @xmath19 to alice s ( bob s ) particle of the @xmath17th ghz state . if it is 1 , hadamard operation @xmath20 is applied .",
    "if the authentication key @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) does not have enough length to cover all ghz particles , new authentication keys can be created by increasing the counter until the authentication keys shield all ghz particles . after making operations on the ghz particles",
    ", trent distributes the states to alice and bob and keeps the remaining for him .    on receiving the qubits , alice and",
    "bob decode the qubits with unitary transformations which are defined by their authentication keys , @xmath15 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "next , alice and bob select some of the decoded qubits , make von - neumann measurements on them , and compare the results through the public channel .",
    "if the error rate is higher than expected , then alice and bob abort the protocol .",
    "otherwise they can confirm that the other party is legitimate and the channel is secure .",
    "they then execute the following message transmission procedures .",
    "alice selects a subset of ghz states in the remaining sets after authentication and keeps it secret .",
    "alice chooses a random sequence which has no connection with the secret message to transmit to bob . following this random sequence",
    ", alice performs unitary transformations on the qubits selected for this check process . before encoding the message and the random sequence ,",
    "alice can encode the secret message with a classical error correction code ( ecc ) such as the hamming code , the reed - solomon code and the bch code , so that bob could be able to correct errors in the decoded message .",
    "for example , if the error rate of the quantum channel is 20@xmath24 and the length of codeword is @xmath25 , then any classical eccs can be used , where the minimum length of the code @xmath26 is larger than @xmath27 .",
    "if the bit of the random sequence , or the message is 0 , then alice performs on her ghz particle with hadamard operation @xmath20 .",
    "otherwise , alice acts at her qubit with first bit flip operation @xmath28 and then hadamard operation @xmath20 . after making all unitary operations , alice transfers all encoded qubits to bob .",
    "bob makes bell measurements on pairs of particles consisting of his qubit and alice s qubit . in this paper",
    "we use the following notations of bell states .",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32    trent measures his third qubit in the x basis and publishes the measurement outcomes .",
    "bob recovers alice s message using the table [ [ ghz ] ] .",
    "for example , if bob measures @xmath33 and trent reveals @xmath34 , then bob can infer alice made @xmath35 operation and she sent 1 .    .",
    "operations on the decrypted ghz state(i.e .",
    "@xmath36 ) and transformation of the ghz state [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ ghz2 ]    alice reveals the position of her check bits and compares them with bob .",
    "if the error rate of the check bits is higher than expected , bob throws away the message .",
    "otherwise , bob can get the whole secret by applying the classical ecc code used by alice if it was used .",
    "the security of our protocol results from the properties of the entanglement of ghz states .",
    "we first analyze the process of authentication .",
    "if trent is honest , then he will generate tripartite ghz states , encrypt them with the right authentication keys and then distribute them to the designated users .",
    "only the designated user can decrypt the qubits to recover the original ghz states .",
    "this procedure can be written in the following form of a sequence of local unitary operation , the initial state : @xmath37 state after trent s transformation @xmath38i + [ f_a ( id_a , c_a ) ] h \\}_a\\ ] ] @xmath39i + [ f_b ( id_b , c_b ) ] h \\}_b",
    "\\vert \\psi_i \\rangle_{1}\\ ] ] and finally the state after alice s and bob s local operations @xmath40i + [ f_a ( id_a   c_a ) ] h \\}_a\\ ] ] @xmath41i + [ f_b ( id_b , c_b ) ] h \\}_b",
    "\\vert \\psi_i \\rangle_{2}\\ ] ] @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the state of the @xmath17-th ghz particle and the subscript 1 , 2 , and 3 represents the three steps of authentication .",
    "of course , such is the situation if there is no eve .",
    "suppose eve intercepts the qubits heading to alice or bob and disguises her or him .",
    "eve can be detected with probability 1/4 per check bits in this authentication process since she does not know alice s or bob s authentication key .",
    "let an attacker , eve , use a coherent attack .",
    "she then causes errors per check bit with a probability 1/4 similarly to bb84 protocol if she uses the original bases used by alice and bob .",
    "it is because eve did nt know the authentication key and she can not decrypt the encoded qubits . for example , if the authentication key bit is 0 , eve does nt make error in the qubit .",
    "otherwise , an error occurs with probability 1/2 .",
    "if eve prepares @xmath44 state and entangles with alice s qubit , then the final state of the protocol qubit and eve s qubit is after decoding by alice and bob as follows .",
    "@xmath45 + @xmath46    this is for a specific attack where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "eve can be detected with higher probability 1/2 per check bit in this case .",
    "hence , if @xmath49 ghz states are checked in the authentication process , alice and bob can confirm that the ghz states are distributed to the legitimate users with probability @xmath50 .",
    "we expect more advanced attack can be detected when @xmath51 is increased .",
    "after authentication process , only alice s qubits are transmitted .",
    "eve will make operations on these qubits in our quantum direct communication protocols . in both protocols ,",
    "eve must not be disclosed during the authentication process to obtain any information of secret message .",
    "suppose eve use the following unitary operation @xmath52 on alice s and her qubit @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then the state of the protocol is changed as follows .",
    "* the states after alice made a unitary operation + @xmath59 + @xmath60 * the states after eve made a unitary operation on her qubit and alice s qubit heading to bob or trent + @xmath61 + @xmath62 + @xmath63 + @xmath64 + @xmath65 + @xmath66 + @xmath67 + @xmath68 + @xmath69 + @xmath70 + @xmath71 $ ]    as shown in the above equations , eve will introduce errors in the check bits with the probability of 1/2 regardless of the order of measurement by bob , trent and eve .",
    "moreover , eve can not get any information from this attack since eve can not distinguish the two cases which alice made operation @xmath20 or @xmath35 .",
    "for example , suppose alice makes operation @xmath72 , bob measures @xmath73 , and eve measures @xmath74 .",
    "then trent will reveal @xmath34 or @xmath75 with equal probability .",
    "if trent reveals @xmath34 then bob can revoke correct information .",
    "otherwise bob can find an error .",
    "hence if the length of the check sequence is long enough , then we can find the existence of eve in the transmission of message and confirm eve does not intercept the message .",
    "we have proposed two authenticated quantum direct communication protocols . after identifying the other user in the communication channel , alice",
    "can directly send a secret message to bob without a previously shared secret key . according to the existence of a quantum link between alice and bob",
    ", they can choose a qdc protocol between two .",
    "if there exists eavesdropping during transmission , the message will be broken and alice and bob can ascertain the existence of eve by the check - bits .",
    "though the message was broken , eve can not get any information of the secret message .",
    "we expect our schemes can be applied well to quantum networks even in a transition period .",
