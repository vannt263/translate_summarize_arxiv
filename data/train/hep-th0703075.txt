    "in the past few years , an intense activity has been devoted to the study of various classes of field theories defined on moyal spaces ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these prototypes of noncommutative field theories involve numerous features stemming from noncommutative geometry @xcite and are thus interesting in themselves .",
    "this interest was further increased by the observation that similar noncommutative field theories seem to emerge rather naturally from limiting regimes of string theory and matrix theory in magnetic backgrounds @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for connections between noncommutative geometry and string theory . recall that in noncommutative geometry the commutative algebras of functions defined on differentiable manifolds ( roughly speaking the coordinates spaces ) are replaced by associative but noncommutative algebras further interpreted as algebras of functions on `` noncommutative spaces '' . within this algebraic framework ,",
    "natural noncommutative analogues of the main geometrical objects usually involved in field theories can be algebraically defined ( such as connections , curvatures , vector bundles ) so that the construction of various noncommutative analogues of field theories can be undertaken ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the starting relevant configuration spaces for the noncommutative field theories are modules over the associative algebras which are naturally viewed as noncommutative analogues for the set of sections of vector bundles .",
    "one example of associative algebra among many others is provided by the associative moyal algebras @xcite therefore playing the role of `` noncommutative moyal spaces '' .",
    "the simplest generalisations of scalar theories to moyal space were shown to suffer from the so called uv / ir - mixing @xcite , a phenomenon that makes the renormalisability very unlikely . basically , the uv / ir - mixing results from the existence of potentially dangerous non - planar diagrams which , albeit uv finite , become singular at exceptional ( low ) external momenta .",
    "this triggers the occurrence of uv divergences in higher order diagrams in which they are involved as subdiagrams .",
    "this signals that uv and ir scales are related in a non - trivial way which should in principle invalidate a wilson - type renormalisation scheme @xcite .",
    "an appealing solution to the uv / ir - mixing has been recently proposed by grosse and wulkenhaar @xcite within the noncommutative @xmath0 model on the 4-dimensional moyal space where @xmath3 is real - valued .",
    "they showed that the uv / ir - mixing can be suppressed by supplementing the initial action with a harmonic oscillator term leading to a renormalisable noncommutative quantum field theory .",
    "the initial proof @xcite was performed within the matrix - base formalism , roughly speaking a basis for the ( schwarz class ) functions for which the associative product of the moyal algebra is a simple matrix product .",
    "this cumbersome proof was simplified through a reformulation into the ( position ) @xmath4-space formalism in @xcite which exhibits some advantages compared to the matrix - base formulation . for instance , the propagator in @xmath4-space can be explicitly computed ( as a mehler kernel @xcite ) and _ actually _ used in calculations . besides , it makes easier the comparison of the renormalisation group for noncommutative theories and their commutative counterpart .",
    "other renormalisable noncommutative matter field theories on moyal spaces have been obtained .",
    "one is the complex - valued scalar theory studied in @xcite which can be viewed as a modified version of the lsz model @xcite ( the scalar theory in @xcite is super - renormalisable ) .",
    "note that interesting solvable noncommutative scalar field theories have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "as far as fermionic theories are concerned , a moyal space version of the gross - neveu model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , called the orientable noncommutative gross - neveu model , has been recently shown to be renormalisable to all orders @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this noncommutative field theory still exhibits some uv / ir - mixing , even in the presence of the fermionic version of the harmonic oscillator quadratic term introduced in @xcite , which however does not prevent the theory from being renormalisable .",
    "note that in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the large-@xmath5 limit of the noncommutative gross - neveu model , however with a restricted interaction , has been studied ; renormalisability is shown at this limit together with asymptotic freedom .",
    "one should keep in mind that the fact that the orientable gross - neveu model is renormalisable in spite of some remaining uv / ir - mixing @xcite indicates that further investigations are needed to actually clarify the role of various generalisations of the above - mentioned harmonic oscillator term , of the related covariance under the langmann - szabo duality @xcite and of their impact in the control of the uv / ir - mixing and renormalisability .",
    "so far , the construction of a renormalisable gauge theory on noncommutative moyal spaces remains still unsolved .",
    "the naive noncommutative extension of the pure yang - mills action on the moyal space exhibits uv / ir mixing @xcite which makes its renormalisability quite unlikely unless it is suitably modified .",
    "it can be easily realized that the initial solution proposed in @xcite within the real - valued @xmath0-model can not be merely extended to gauge theories on moyal spaces . in the absence of clear guideline ,",
    "one reasonable way to follow is to assume that the langmann - szabo duality may appear as a necessary ingredient in the construction of a renormalisable gauge theory as it has been the case for the real - valued @xmath0-model .",
    "then , any attempt to adapt the solution given in @xcite to gauge theories would presumably amount to reconcile within a modified action its invariance under gauge transformations with some covariance under the langmann - szabo duality . more technically , one has to determine whether or not the naive noncommutative yang - mills action can be supplemented by additional terms that preserve gauge invariance while making possible the appearance of covariance under the langmann - szabo duality . a convenient way to actually determine all the above - mentioned additional gauge invariant terms",
    "can be achieved by computing , at least at the one - loop order , the noncommutative effective gauge theory stemming from a matter field theory coupled to an external gauge potential in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we start from a renormalisable scalar ( euclidean ) field theory extending to complex - valued fields @xmath6 the renormalisable noncommutative @xmath0-model with harmonic oscillator term studied in @xcite .",
    "this is presented in section 2 where we also collect the main technical tools .",
    "the above action is minimally coupled to an external gauge potential giving rise to a gauge - invariant action @xmath7 .",
    "the analysis is based consistently on the usual algebraic definition of noncommutative connections for which the modules of the moyal algebra plays the role of the set of sections of vector bundles of the ordinary geometry , while the noncommutative analogue of gauge transformations are naturally associated with automorphism of ( hermitian ) modules .",
    "this is presented in detail in the second part of section 2 . from @xmath7 , we compute the one - loop effective action @xmath8 obtained as usual by formally integrating out the scalar field .",
    "the corresponding calculation of the various contributions relevant to the effective action is presented in section 3 .",
    "all the computations are performed within the @xmath4-space formalism .",
    "the resulting action is further analysed and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the implications of the non - vanishing of the one - point ( tadpole ) contribution are outlined .",
    "this non - vanishing triggers automatically the occurrence of gauge invariant terms supplementing the noncommutative version of the pure yang - mills term in the effective action .",
    "this suggests a possible expression of a candidate for a renormalisable action for a gauge theory defined on moyal spaces in which these additional terms would be the gauge theory counterpart of the the harmonic term ensuring the renormalisability of the @xmath0-theory .",
    "we first collect the mathematical tools entering the definition of the moyal algebra that will be relevant for the ensuing analysis . a more mathematical presentation can be found in @xcite . in the following",
    ", the `` @xmath9 '' symbol denotes the associative moyal - groenenwald product .",
    "it can be first defined on @xmath10 ( denoted in short by @xmath11 in the following ) , the space of complex - valued schwartz functions on @xmath12 with fast decay at infinity , by @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 is an invertible constant skew - symmetric matrix which in 4d can be chosen as @xmath17 with @xmath18 where simplifies noticeably the calculation of the effective action .",
    "although this choice breaks apparently the @xmath19 `` lorentz '' invariance , it turns out that the calculation can be actually performed in a lorentz - covariant way . ]",
    "the @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 and the parameter @xmath23 has mass dimension @xmath24 .",

    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are dimensionless . at this point , some comments are in order .",
    "this model can not be viewed as related to some lsz - type model @xcite since in that latter case the corresponding action would have been of the form @xmath51 it can easily be realised that the quadratic terms in do not coincide with those involved in , giving rise therefore to different propagators for these actions ( as well as , anticipating with the discussion of the next subsection , different minimal coupling prescriptions ) .",
    "notice however that both actions are covariant under the langmann - szabo duality @xcite .",
    "it turns out , as it will be shown in a while , that the operator @xmath52 can actually be related to a connection @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "in , the term involving @xmath49 can be viewed as the ( complex - valued ) scalar counterpart of the harmonic oscillator term first introduced in @xcite leading to the construction of a renormalisable noncommutative ( real - valued ) @xmath55-model .",
    "although our one - loop computation of effective actions will not depend on the explicit form of the interaction , it is instructive to discuss it more closely in view of the corresponding consequences on the renormalisability of the models .",
    "the most general interaction can be written as @xmath56 we point out that the only diagrams that can be orientated are those occurring in the loopwise expansion obtained from @xmath57 while @xmath58 yields diagrams in the loopwise expansion that can not be oriented .",
    "recall now that the proof of the renormalisability of the noncommutative version of the gross - neveu model studied in @xcite ( whose interaction term is the fermionic counterpart of @xmath57 ) relies heavily on the orientability of the diagrams .",
    "it turns out @xcite that restricted to @xmath57 is renormalisable for any value of @xmath49 .",
    "besides , a similar conclusion applies for the lsz - type model restricted to @xmath57 .",
    "the proof , as sketched in @xcite , is somehow similar to the one given in @xcite for the noncommutative gross - neveu model .",
    "at the present time , the actual impact of interaction terms as given by @xmath58 on the renormalisability of the above models is not known .",
    "the feynman graphs can be computed from the propagator and interaction vertex derived from . in the following",
    ", we will work within the @xmath4-space formalism @xcite which proves particularly convenient as it simplifies the calculations .",

    "the generic graphical representation of the vertex is depicted on the figure  [ fig : vertex ] .",
    "the non - locality of the interaction is conveniently represented by the rhombus appearing on fig .  [",

    "it is useful to represent the alternate signs in the delta function of by plus- and minus - signs , as depicted on the figure . by convention ,",
    "a plus - sign ( resp .",
    "minus - sign ) corresponds to an incoming field @xmath66 ( resp .",
    "outgoing field @xmath6 ) .",
    "this permits one to define an orientation on the diagrams obtained from the loop expansion .",
    "it is necessary to define clearly the mathematical status @xcite ( see also @xcite ) of the various objects that will be involved in the minimal coupling prescription .",
    "recall that @xmath37 is a unital involutive algebra .",

    "the usual concept of connections defined on vector bundles in ordinary geometry can be consistently generalised in noncommutative geometry to connections on projective modules ( over an associative algebra ) .",
    "namely , a connection can be defined ( algebraically ) by a linear map @xmath74 verifying the leibnitz rule : @xmath75 and preserving the hermitian structure , that is @xmath76 when @xmath77 , that we assume from now on , it follows from that the connection is entirely determined by its action @xmath78 on the unit @xmath79 , denoted by @xmath80 since one has obviously @xmath81 .",

    "note that any one - form can be used to define a connection so that if some @xmath82 defines a connection , then @xmath107 , @xmath108 , defines another connection .",
    "there is a subtlety here that must be pointed out .",
    "the gauge transformations _ do not preserve the structure of linear space _ of gauge potentials since @xmath109 this is easily obtained by comparing how the gauge transformations as given by operate on @xmath110 and @xmath111 according to and expresses the fact that multiplication of a gauge potential by a scalar and gauge transformation are two noncommuting operations .",
    "the same discussion applies to the sum of two gauge potentials @xmath112 .",
    "it is useful to exhibit a special reference connection that will play a salient role in the following .",
    "it turns out that @xmath113 defines a connection invariant under gauge transformations .",

    "these transformations will be more closely analysed in the next subsection .",
    "let us assume that the action of the gauge group on the matter fields @xmath6 is given by . then , owing to the special role played by the coordinate functions @xmath39 through the invariant `` gauge potential '' involved in @xmath128 and the expression for the inner derivatives , it follows that a natural choice for the minimal coupling of the action to an external gauge field @xmath82 is obtained by performing the usual substitution @xmath129 on the action @xmath73 _ and _ @xmath114 , using in particular the following identity : @xmath130 by using , one easily infers that the minimal coupling prescription can be conveniently written as @xmath131 note that gauge invariance of the resulting action functional is obviously obtained thanks to the relation @xmath132 .    by applying the above minimal coupling prescription to , we obtain the following gauge - invariant action @xmath133 where @xmath134 is given by with @xmath47 restricted to its gauge - invariant part @xmath57 , see . at this level , it is instructive to interpret the action in the light of the algebraic framework that has been developed above . as already mentioned in subsection 2.1 , the operator @xmath135 is actually related to a connection @xmath136 with @xmath137 since the following relation @xmath138 holds in view of .",

    "it can be easily realised that the corresponding action quoted in @xcite can be cast into the form @xmath144 where the ellipses denote interaction terms , @xmath145 is a spinor and the antihermitian @xmath84 matrices satisfy @xmath146 . in physical words , it should be clear that these two latter actions can be interpreted as matter actions already coupled to an external ( background ) gauge potential @xmath147 ( while the action does not obviously support this interpretation ) .",
    "as announced in the last subsection , another type of transformations given by @xmath148 for any @xmath149 , has been also considered in the literature .",

    "actually , the noncommutative analogue of the adjoint representation of the gauge group is constructed with the help of the real structure @xmath21 ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",

    "we started from a renormalisable scalar field theory which can be viewed as the extension to complex valued fields @xmath6 of the renormalisable noncommutative @xmath0 with harmonic term studied in @xcite . by further applying a minimal coupling prescription , that we discussed in section 2 , this action is coupled to an external gauge potential and gives rise to a gauge - invariant action @xmath7 , the point of departure for the computation of the effective action @xmath8",
    "the whole analysis is based on the usual algebraic construction of connections relevant to a noncommutative framework .",
    "as presented in section 2 , the modules of the algebra play the role of the set of sections of vector bundles of ordinary geometry while the noncommutative analogue of gauge transformations are naturally associated with the automorphisms of ( hermitian ) modules .",
    "the fact that @xmath37 involves only inner derivations implies the existence of a gauge - invariant connection which is further used as a reference connection .",
    "it plays a special role in the minimal coupling prescription and permits one to relate the so - called covariant coordinates @xcite to a tensorial form built from the difference of two connections .",
    "we also pointed out that scalar fields which transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group do not fit into the above algebraic framework , because noncommutative gauge transformations are automorphisms of modules while `` adjoint transformations '' are automorphisms of the algebra .",
    "we have computed at the one - loop order the effective action @xmath8 given in , obtained by integrating over the scalar field @xmath6 , for any value of the harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath200 $ ] in @xmath7 .",
    "details of the calculation are collected in the section 3 .",
    "we find that the effective action involves , beyond the usual expected yang - mills contribution , additional terms of quadratic and quartic order in @xmath121 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "these additional terms are gauge invariant thanks to the gauge transformation of @xmath121 .",
    "the quadratic term involves a mass term for the gauge potential @xmath82 ( while such a bare mass term for a gauge potential is forbidden by gauge invariance in commutative yang - mills theories ) .",
    "we further notice that the presence of a quartic term @xmath203 accompanying the standard yang - mills term is reminiscent to the occurrence of a ( covariance under a ) langmann - szabo duality @xcite .",
    "basically , langmann - szabo duality is generated through the exchange @xmath204 which , upon using and @xmath205 , can be expressed as @xmath206_\\star \\leftrightarrows \\{\\xi_\\mu,.\\}_\\star$ ] .",
    "this , combined with , therefore suggests that some covariance under langmann - szabo duality would show up whenever both commutators and anti - commutators are involved in the action .",
    "by the way , at the special value @xmath207 where the scalar model considered in @xcite is duality - invariant , the effective action is fully symmetric under the exchange @xmath208_\\star \\leftrightarrows \\{{\\cal{a}}_\\mu,{\\cal{a}}_\\nu\\}_\\star$ ] .",
    "recently , a calculation based on the machinery of duhamel expansions of the ( one - loop ) action for the effective gauge theory stemming from a ( real - valued ) scalar theory with harmonic term has been carried in @xcite .",
    "the scalar theory considered in @xcite was somehow similar to the one described by the action together with transformations as those given in .",
    "the analysis was performed within the matrix base so that , due to the complexity of the calculations , in four dimensions only the case @xmath207 was considered .",
    "our result for the effective action @xmath198 agrees globally with the one given in @xcite , up to unessential numerical factors .",
    "notice that the calculations are easier within the @xmath4-space formalism even when @xmath209 .    at this point ,",
    "one important comment relative to is in order .",
    "the fact that the tadpole is non - vanishing ( see ) is a rather unusual feature for a yang - mills type theory .",
    "this non - vanishing implies automatically the occurrence of the mass - type term @xmath210 as well as the quartic term @xmath211 . keeping this in mind together with the expected impact of the langmann - szabo duality on renormalisability ,",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that the following class of actions @xmath212 involves suitable candidates for renormalisable actions for gauge theory defined on moyal spaces .",
    "recall that the naive action for a yang - mills theory on the moyal space , @xmath213 , exhibits uv / ir mixing @xcite , making its renormalisability quite problematic .",
    "in , the second term built from the anticommutator may be viewed as the `` gauge counterpart '' of the harmonic term ensuring the renormalisability of the @xmath0 theory investigated in @xcite , while @xmath150 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 are real parameters and @xmath216 denotes some coupling constant . according to the above discussion",
    ", the presence of the quadratic and quartic terms in @xmath121 in will be reflected in a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value for @xmath82 .",
    "the consequences of a possible occurrence of this non - trivial vacuum remain to be understood and properly controlled in view of a further gauge - fixing of a ( classical ) gauge action stemming from combined with a convenient regularisation scheme ( that could be obtained by some adaptation of @xcite ) .",
    "we will come back to these points in a forthcoming publication .",
