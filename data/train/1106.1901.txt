    "the matrix elements of local operators ( form factors ) are central objects in quantum field theory . in two - dimensional integrable quantum field theory",
    "the @xmath1 matrix can be obtained exactly in the framework of factorized scattering developed in @xcite ( for a later review see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in such theories using the scattering amplitudes as input it is possible to obtain a set of equations satisfied by the form factors .",
    "the complete system of form factor equations , which provides the basis for a programmatic approach ( the so - called form factor bootstrap ) was proposed in @xcite . for a detailed and thorough exposition of the subject we refer to @xcite on bulk form factors ; later this approach was also extended to form factors of boundary operators @xcite .",
    "although the connection with the lagrangian formulation of quantum field theory is rather indirect in the bootstrap approach , it is thought that the general solution of the form factor axioms determines the complete local operator algebra of the theory .",
    "this expectation was confirmed in many cases by explicit comparison of the space of solutions to the spectrum of local operators as described by the ultraviolet limiting conformal field theory @xcite ; the mathematical foundation is provided by the local commutativity theorem stating that operators specified by solutions of the form factor bootstrap are mutually local @xcite",
    ". another important piece of information comes from correlation functions : using form factors , a spectral representation for the correlation functions can be built which provides a large distance expansion @xcite , while the lagrangian or perturbed conformal field theory formulation allows one to obtain a short - distance expansion , which can then be compared provided there is an overlap between their regimes of validity @xcite .",
    "other evidence for the correspondence between the field theory and the solutions of the form factor bootstrap results from evaluating sum rules like zamolodchikov s @xmath2-theorem @xcite or the @xmath3-theorem @xcite , both of which can be used to express conformal data as spectral sums in terms of form factors .",
    "direct comparisons with multi - particle matrix elements are not so readily available , except for perturbative or @xmath4 calculations in some simple cases @xcite .",
    "therefore , part of the motivation is to provide non - perturbative evaluation of form factors from the hamiltonian formulation , which then allows for a direct comparison with solutions of the form factor axioms .",
    "another goal is to have a better understanding of finite size effects in the case of matrix elements of local operators , and to contribute to the investigation of finite volume @xcite ( and also finite temperature @xcite ) form factors and correlation functions .",
    "this program has been successfully pursued in the case of diagonal scattering theories ( those without particle mass degeneracies ) , both in the bulk and with boundary @xcite .",
    "however , an extension to the non - diagonal case is still missing , and the present work is a step in that direction .",
    "it is important to realize that non - diagonal theories , whose spectra contain some nontrivial particle multiplets ( typically organized into representations of some group symmetry ) , such as the @xmath5 nonlinear sigma model are very important for condensed matter applications ( e.g. to spin chains ; cf .",
    "the finite volume description of form factors can be used to develop a low - temperature and large - distance expansion for finite - temperature correlation functions @xcite , which could in turn be used to explain experiments such as data from inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "therefore the extension to non - diagonal theories is an interesting direction .",
    "sine - gordon model can be considered as the prototype of a non - diagonal scattering theory , and it has the advantage that its finite volume spectra and form factors can be studied numerically using the truncated conformal space approach , originally developed by yurov and zamolodchikov for the scaling lee - yang model , but later extended to the sine - gordon theory @xcite .",
    "its exact form factors are also known in full generality ( at least in principle  see the discussion on multi - soliton form factors later ) , and so it is a useful playground to test our theoretical ideas on finite volume form factors .",
    "this cuts in another way too since our approach also provides a way to test the conjectured exact form factors in much more details than allowed by the usual methods listed above .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we collect the necessary facts about the sine - gordon form factors in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we turn our attention to the breather form factors , which can be treated by the methods developed for diagonal scattering theories .",
    "section 4 contains our results on soliton form factors , as well as a conjecture how the finite volume form factor formulae derived earlier in @xcite can be extended to non - diagonal theories . at present",
    "we are only able to perform a partial check of this conjecture due to difficulties in evaluating multi - soliton form factors numerically .",
    "section 5 sums up our conclusions .",
    "the paper also contains an appendix devoted to a brief description of the algebraic bethe ansatz technique that can be used to obtain the finite volume description of multi - soliton energy levels .",

    "form factors of higher breathers can be constructed by considering them as bound states of @xmath32 particles .",
    "detailed formulae can be found in appendix a of @xcite .      at present",
    ", there are three independent constructions of solitonic form factors available : the earliest one by smirnov ( reviewed in @xcite ) , the free field representation by lukyanov @xcite and the work by babujian et al . @xcite . here",
    "we use formulae from lukyanov s work @xcite .",
    "the simplest form factor for an exponential operator is with a soliton - antisoliton state and it takes the form@xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the soliton and antisoliton , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath36 is given by the integral representation@xmath37 where , again , the second formula is eventually independent of the natural number @xmath25 ; it provides a representation which converges faster numerically and is valid further away from the real @xmath12 axis with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "higher form factors in all the available constructions are given in some quite complicated integral representation which we do not write down here .",
    "we have been unable to find a numerical evaluation of these analytic formulae at present , which precludes their use in a comparison with tcsa data .",
    "as breathers are singlet and so scatter diagonally , the formulae presented in the papers @xcite are directly applicable .",
    "the first ingredient is to describe the multi - breather energy levels corresponding to the states@xmath38 whose finite volume counter part we are going to label@xmath39 where the @xmath40 are the momentum quantum numbers . in a finite volume @xmath41 ,",
    "momentum quantization is governed ( up to corrections decreasing exponentially with @xmath41 ) by the bethe - yang equations:@xmath42 where the phase - shift is defined as @xmath43 in practical calculations , because breathers of the same species satisfy an effective exclusion rule due to@xmath44 it is best to redefine phase - shifts corresponding to them by extracting a @xmath45 sign:@xmath46 so that @xmath47 can be taken for all @xmath48 and all the phase - shifts can be defined as continuous functions over the whole real @xmath12 axis .",
    "this entails shifting appropriate quantum numbers @xmath40 to half - integer values .",
    "given a solution @xmath49 to the quantization relations ( [ eq : breatherby ] ) the energy and the momentum of the state can be written as @xmath50 ( using that  with our choice of the phase - shift functions ",
    "unitarity entails @xmath51 ) .",
    "the rapidity - space density of @xmath27-particle states can be calculated as @xmath52 the matrix elements of local operators between finite volume multi - particle states can be written as @xcite @xmath53 ( note that we can not specify the phase of the matrix elements as it depends on phase conventions which can be different in finite and infinite volume ) which is valid provided there are no disconnected terms .",
    "such terms appear when there are two breathers of the same species in the two states whose rapidities coincide . apart from some very special cases",
    ", this happens only when the two states are identical , which is called the diagonal matrix element .",
    "the necessary formulae are written down in @xcite ; instead of quoting here the rather lengthy general expression , we present the two particular cases we need:@xmath54 where@xmath55 is the vacuum expectation value of the local operator @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the so - called symmetric evaluation of the four - particle form factor . note that in the diagonal case there is no possible phase difference between the finite - volume matrix elements and the infinite volume form factors , as any phase redefinition of the state drops out from the matrix element .",
    "the above predictions for finite volume energy levels and matrix elements are expected to be exact to all ( finite ) orders in @xmath58 @xcite ( note that the exponential corrections are non - analytic in this variable ) .",
    "to evaluate the form factors numerically , we use the truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa ) pioneered by yurov and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "the extension to the sine - gordon model was developed in @xcite and has found numerous applications since then .",
    "the hilbert space can be split by the eigenvalues of the topological charge @xmath59 ( or winding number ) and the spatial momentum @xmath60 , where the eigenvalues of the latter are of the form@xmath61 @xmath62 is called the conformal spin.    in sectors with vanishing topological charge , we can make use of the symmetry of the hamiltonian under @xmath63 which is equivalent to conjugation of the solitonic charge .",
    "the truncated space can be split into @xmath64-even and @xmath64-odd subspaces that have roughly equal dimensions , which speeds up the diagonalization of the hamiltonian by roughly a factor of eight ( the required machine time scales approximately with the third power of matrix size ) .",
    "we remark that there is another discrete symmetry@xmath65 corresponding to spatial parity , which is a symmetry in @xmath66 sectors .",
    "however , we use the @xmath67 states extensively in our calculations .    for the calculations , we choose the operator@xmath68 which is essentially one half of the interaction term in the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : pcft_action ] ) .",
    "the semicolons denote normal ordering with respect to the @xmath69 free massless boson modes .",
    "this operator has conformal dimension@xmath70 using relation ( [ eq : mass_scale ] ) we can express all energy levels and matrix elements in units of ( appropriate powers of ) the soliton mass @xmath7 , and we also introduce the dimensionless volume variable @xmath71 . the general procedure is the same as in @xcite : the particle content of energy levels can be identified by matching the numerical tcsa spectrum against the predictions of the bethe - yang equations ( [ eq : breatherby ] ) . after identification , one can compare the appropriate matrix elements to the theoretical values given by ( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) and ( [ eq : br_diagff ] ) .",
    "due to level crossings , at certain values of the volume @xmath41 there can be more than one tcsa candidate levels for a given bethe - yang solution ; identification can be completed by selecting the candidate on the basis of one of the form factor measurements , which still leaves other matrix elements involving the state as cross - checks .",
    "level crossings also present a problem in numerical stability , since in their vicinity the state of interest is nearly degenerate to another one . since the truncation effect can be considered as an additional perturbing operator ,",
    "the level crossings are eventually lifted .",
    "such a near - degeneracy greatly magnifies truncation effects on the eigenvectors and therefore the matrix elements @xcite .",
    "this is the reason behind the fact that in some of the figures there are some individual numerical points that are clearly scattered away from their expected place .",
    "the simplest matrix element to test is the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : exactvev ] ) for the exact vacuum expectation value , and we did check it against the numerical results . however , it has already been subjected to extensive verification against tcsa in @xcite , therefore we do not dwell on this issue here .",
    "one - particle form factors can be tested using a reorganized form of the relation ( [ eq : genffrelation]):@xmath72 ( the form factors themselves are independent of the rapidity of the particle due to lorentz invariance ) .",

    "]    all of these tests show excellent agreement between numerics and theory , which make us confident both in the finite volume form factor formalism and the correctness of the exact form factors ( [ eq : b1ffs ] ) predicted by the bootstrap .",
    "we can also use the identified @xmath83 state to compute matrix elements involving it .",
    "however , in some cases simply using ( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) gives a rather poor match .",
    "it turns out that accounting for some of the hitherto neglected exponential corrections can improve this ; the leading corrections come from so - called @xmath0-terms which were constructed in @xcite building upon the ideas in lscher s seminal paper @xcite .",
    "we remark that the method outlined below eventually does more ; it entails a resummation of these correction beyond the mere construction of the leading exponential correction .    using the ideas in @xcite",
    ", we can model a finite volume @xmath83 state as a pair of @xmath32 particles with complex conjugate rapidities by solving the @xmath24 bethe - yang equations ( here written in exponential form):@xmath84 the solution for @xmath85 has the large volume behaviour @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 some numerical constant .",
    "therefore , for @xmath89 one obtains the usual bootstrap identification@xmath90 and the momentum and energy of the state tends to@xmath91 where @xmath92 is the mass of * @xmath83 * in terms of that of @xmath32 , consistent with ( [ eq : breather_mass ] ) .    in order to do this , however , formula ( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) must be continued to complex rapidities , which requires matching the phases of the matrix elements on the two sides .",
    "this is not difficult to do by observing that the tcsa matrix elements are all real are all real . as a results , all eigenvectors are also real and therefore all the matrix elements computed from tcsa",
    "are real as well .",
    "] , while the phase of the minimal form factor function @xmath93 ( [ eq : brminff ] ) is just half the phase of the two - particle @xmath1-matrix @xmath94 . using the results of @xcite one obtains@xmath95 where @xmath96",
    ", @xmath97 is the solution of ( [ eq : b2_b1b1_by ] ) with the correct momentum , ie . @xmath98 and",
    "the dots denote further ( and generally much smaller ) exponential corrections ; the @xmath99 sign accounts for the remaining phase ambiguity from the square root .",
    "one can similarly evaluate @xmath100 matrix elements using@xmath101 where the absolute values are necessary because we have not compensated for the phase difference due to the presence of the additional @xmath32 .",
    "we observed substantial improvement over the naive matrix elements ( [ eq : genffrelation ] ) that neglect the @xmath0-term contributions ; some of our data are demonstrated in figure [ fig : mu - terms ] .",
    "the effect is very dramatic for the @xmath100 case , the naive prediction drastically disagrees with the numerical results , while the inclusion of the @xmath0-terms leads to excellent agreement .",
    "this is in fact a bit unexpected , as the value for the exponent for @xmath79 is @xmath102 whose coefficient is not particularly small . in the original example in @xcite one of the particles was loosely bound , resulting in a very small value for @xmath0 , which in turn led to large finite size corrections from the particle splitting up in finite volume .",
    "this is not case for @xmath83 considered as a bound state of two @xmath32s at the particular value of the coupling @xmath103 in question .",
    "however , the full behaviour is determined not only by the exponent , but also by the detailed behaviour of the @xmath1-matrix amplitude and the form factor near the pole ; it is the latter that enhances the correction in the @xmath100 case .",
    "we return to this observation and its implications in the conclusion .",
    "naive predictions for matrix elements involving @xmath83 , together with ones including @xmath0-term corrections compared to numerical data for the @xmath83-vacuum and @xmath104 matrix elements at @xmath79 . ]      for the diagonal matrix element we observe significant difference between the numerical results and the theoretical predictions as shown in figure [ fig : diagonal - b1b1b1b1 ] .",
    "it is apparent from the data that agreement is better for lower values of @xmath103 . for large volumes ,",
    "this is easily explained by the better convergence of tcsa since the dominant source of errors in the large volume data is the hilbert space truncation , and improvement of truncation errors with decreasing @xmath103 was observed in all the data we analyzed .",
    "however , this can not be the origin the deviation in the medium range of volume ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "this deviation also decreases for smaller @xmath103 , and is likely to have its origin in a @xmath0-term correction . evaluating such a @xmath0-term requires modeling @xmath32 as a soliton - antisoliton bound state , which we are not able to do at present as it necessitates numerically handling eight - particle solitonic form factors . as for the variation of the @xmath0-term with @xmath103 ,",

    "another interesting issue is the role played by the so - called @xmath0-terms , which are exponential corrections to the volume dependence of the matrix elements resulting from particle fusions ( in other words , three - particle couplings between on - shell particle states ) .",
    "the exponential decay of these corrections depends only on the mass spectrum ; however , their strength is also determined by appropriate form factors , as illustrated in subsection [ sub : mu - terms - for - b2 ] by the fact that for the same @xmath83 state ( hence the same @xmath0-term kinematics ) , the significance of the corrections depends very much on the matrix element the state is involved in .    in this work we generally took the stance of using the bootstrap results to predict the numerical finite volume results .",
    "however , one could take the opposite route and extract field theoretically interesting matrix elements from the finite volume data ( which we also did for cases involving two - particle matrix elements ) .",
    "this is common in lattice field theory and was advocated by lellouch and lscher in @xcite as a way to circumvent the so - called maiani - testa no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "we have previously used a similar approach to determine resonance parameters from finite volume spectra @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-term results have an implication for such studies , which aim to determine matrix elements ( e.g. related to weak interaction ) from finite volume data ( whether using lattice monte - carlo or some other numerical method ) .",
    "the important lesson is that even if the appropriate exponential factor @xmath0 ( as determined by the mass spectrum ) is not small and therefore volume suppression is expected to be strong , the @xmath0-term can still have a sizable effect at the values of volume the applied numerical method ( whether tcsa or lattice ) can reach .",
    "in addition , this term could vary strongly between different matrix elements involving the same state , thereby producing very large systematic errors when extracting matrix elements of local operators from numerical simulations ( indeed , the corrections could of the order of 100% as illustrated by the @xmath104 matrix element plotted in figure [ fig : mu - terms ] ) .",

    "the independent solutions of the bethe equations for the wave vector are then given by@xmath173 provided the particle rapidities satisfy the bethe - yang equations@xmath174 in this way we reduced the problem to finding the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and then solving a system of @xmath25 coupled scalar equations .",
    "note that the sine - gordon scattering preserves the solitonic charge @xmath59 and charge parity @xmath64 , which act on @xmath175 as follows:@xmath176 the transfer matrix @xmath177 commutes with these operators .",

    "the magnonic configuration as detailed in the previous subsection fixes the `` isospin '' structure of the state in the @xmath156 dimensional internal charge space .",
    "the two equations must be solved simultaneously . in principle , the positions of the magnons are fixed in terms of the rapidities @xmath222 so the density of states with a given @xmath25 , @xmath120 and fixed isospin structure can be computed from the quantization relations of the solitons@xmath223 by taking the jacobi determinant of the rapidity @xmath224 quantum numbers mapping @xcite@xmath225 where it is understood that we differentiate also the dependence of the @xmath180 with respect to the rapidities .",
    "however , there is an easier way to obtain the density of states by extending the set of by equations by those of the magnons , considering also the magnonic quantization relations@xmath226 then one has the following result@xmath227 where the first determinant is the @xmath228 jacobi determinant formed by including the magnonic equations , differentiating by keeping the @xmath229 and @xmath230 independent , and the second is the @xmath231 one containing only the magnonic relations .",
    "this can be proven with a bit of labour by expressing the derivatives @xmath232 by differentiating the magnonic relations and using simple properties of determinants . however , the result is very easy to understand intuitively .",
    "since the magnons do not have independently chosen quantum numbers ( their position is fixed by the rapidities of the solitons ) , the solitonic phase space volume can be obtained from the phase space volume calculated with all variables ( rapidities and magnons ) involved , divided by the volume contribution of the magnons themselves .",
