    "in a landmark paper on the description of ferromagnets at low temperatures @xcite , bloch introduced the concept of spin waves and identified them as the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "as an immediate application , he evaluated the leading coefficient in the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization : this term , corresponding to noninteracting magnons , is of order @xmath2 . as is well - known",
    ", various authors subsequently tried to find the leading term in this series originating from the spin - wave interaction , ending up with conflicting results : corrections to bloch s law both of order @xmath3 and @xmath4 were found @xcite .",
    "the situation remained rather unclear until dyson , in his pioneering analysis of the thermodynamic behavior of an ideal ferromagnet @xcite , showed that the previous results were wrong altogether and that the spin - wave interaction in the spontaneous magnetization starts manifesting itself only at order @xmath0 .",
    "dyson s motivation was the apparent contradiction between the various results published in the literature .",
    "he successfully solved this paradox by setting up a fairly complicated mathematical machinery  in his own words @xcite : _ `` the method of the present paper settled the disagreement by showing that both calculations were wrong''_. in fact , as dyson states in ref .",
    "@xcite , a third calculation existed that was also in contradiction with the other two .    within the last few decades",
    "several articles have appeared dealing with the structure of the series for the spontaneous magnetization _ beyond _ the dyson term .",
    "various authors , using different methods , have given their account on what the temperature power of the next - to - leading order term due to the spin - wave interaction should be and how the general structure of the series beyond dyson should look like .",
    "not all of these results that have appeared in the literature over time , however , as we discuss in more detail later on , are consistent with one another .",
    "our main motivation is thus reminiscent of dyson s , namely , to determine which one of these calculations yields the correct low - temperature expansion for the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet .    due to its mathematical rigor ,",
    "dyson s calculation is not easy to understand and the perturbative scheme developed for the evaluation of the partition function is fairly complicated . indeed , after dyson s analysis , many authors tried to reproduce and rederive his result with alternative methods in a more accessible manner @xcite . among these references",
    "we would like to point out the paper by zittartz @xcite , upon which dyson comments _",
    "`` zittartz replaced my cumbersome mathematics by a simple and elegant construction '' _ @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , not all authors were able to confirm dyson s result : in particular , a new interaction term in the spontaneous magnetization of order @xmath5 started to haunt the literature @xcite  later on , this term was recognized as spurious and dyson s series was confirmed to be correct @xcite .",
    "while all these studies were performed within the framework of microscopic or phenomenological theories based on the heisenberg model , in the present work , we will follow another approach which has the virtue of being completely systematic and model - independent : the method of effective lagrangians . within the effective lagrangian framework ,",
    "the structure of the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite up to order @xmath0 and dyson s series was reproduced in a straightforward manner . in the effective language , as we will see , this corresponds to including feynman diagrams for the partition function up to two loops .",
    "the effective analysis also readily demonstrated that there is no interaction term of order @xmath5 in the low - temperature series of the spontaneous magnetization .    in the present work we go beyond dyson s analysis and",
    "explicitly calculate the effect of the spin - wave interaction beyond @xmath0 in the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that the structure of this power series is given in a fully systematic and rigorous way .",
    "going beyond dyson s analysis then means that , in the effective lagrangian framework , we have to consider feynman diagrams up to three - loop order in the perturbative expansion of the partition function .",
    "as it turns out , in the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet , the next - to - leading interaction term already sets in at order @xmath1  remarkably , the corresponding coefficient is completely determined by the two low - energy coupling constants of the leading - order effective lagrangian @xmath6 .",
    "it does not involve any higher - order effective constants from @xmath7 where the anisotropies of the cubic lattice start showing up .",
    "although several authors have also discussed the structure of temperature powers beyond the @xmath0-term , their conclusions are in contradiction with the systematic effective field - theory approach and therefore erroneous .",
    "in particular , to the best of our knowledge , none of the existing calculations ended up with an _ interaction _ term of order @xmath1 , which in fact represents the leading correction to dyson s result .    within the effective lagrangian framework",
    ", we then analyze the general structure of even higher - order corrections in the spontaneous magnetization originating from the spin - wave interaction , and show that these are of order @xmath8  again contradicting earlier calculations that have appeared in the literature .",
    "the effective lagrangian method is based on an analysis of the symmetry properties of the underlying theory , i.e. , the heisenberg model in our case , and can universally be applied to systems with a spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "it is formulated in terms of goldstone boson fields which represent the dominant low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "the effective lagrangian method is very well established in particle physics , where the low - energy effective theory for quantum chromodynamics ",
    "chiral perturbation theory  has been constructed a long time ago @xcite .",
    "there , we are dealing with a spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and the corresponding goldstone bosons are the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is also a common phenomenon in condensed matter physics and the effective lagrangian method has in fact been transferred to this domain in ref .",
    "@xcite : magnons and phonons , e.g. , are the goldstone bosons resulting from a spontaneously broken spin rotation symmetry @xmath9 and a spontaneously broken translation symmetry , respectively .",
    "in particular , the leading - order effective lagrangian for the o(3 ) ferromagnet was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the extension to higher orders in the derivative expansion was performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . since",
    "the systematic effective lagrangian method is still not very well known within the condensed matter community , in sec .",
    "[ method ] we give a brief outline of the method , having in mind the ferromagnet as specific system . in sec .",

    "we then go beyond dyson s analysis and extend the evaluation to order @xmath11 in sec .",

    "while the renormalization up to order @xmath10 is straightforward , the handling of ultraviolet divergences at order @xmath11 is more involved and is considered in detail in sec .  [ renorm ] .",

    "[ conclusions ] , details on the numerical evaluation of a specific three - loop graph are discussed in appendix [ appendix a ] .",
    "we would like to provide the interested reader with a list of publications that deal with applications of the effective lagrangian method to condensed matter systems .",
    "applications to systems exhibiting collective magnetic behavior include spin - wave scattering processes @xcite , spin - wave mediated nonreciprocal effects in antiferromagnets @xcite , antiferromagnets at finite volume @xcite and finite temperature @xcite , spin waves in canted phases @xcite and antiferromagnets in two dimensions doped with charge carriers @xcite .",
    "further applications include phonons @xcite , so(5 ) invariance and high-@xmath12-superconductivity @xcite as well as supersolids @xcite .",
    "pedagogic introductions to the effective lagrangian method may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in particular , we would like to point out that in a recent article on an analytically solvable microscopic model for a hole - doped ferromagnet in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite , the correctness of the effective field theory approach was demonstrated by comparing the effective theory predictions with the microscopic calculation .",
    "likewise , in a series of high - accuracy investigations of the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath13 quantum heisenberg model on a square lattice using the loop - cluster algorithm @xcite , the monte carlo data were confronted with the analytic predictions of magnon chiral perturbation theory and the low - energy constants were extracted with permille accuracy .",
    "all these tests unambiguously demonstrate that the effective lagrangian approach provides a rigorous and systematic derivative expansion for both ferromagnetic an antiferromagnetic systems .",
    "the effective lagrangian method is based on a symmetry analysis of the underlying system . in the present case we study ferromagnets , which are described by the heisenberg model",
    ". nevertheless , the effective field - theory predictions are model - independent and universal , as they are valid for any system displaying the same symmetries as the heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "microscopic details of the system are taken into account through a few low - energy coupling constants in the effective lagrangian .",
    "symmetry does not fix the actual numerical values of these couplings  in general , these have to be determined experimentally or in a numerical simulation of the underlying model . symmetry , however , does unambiguously determine the derivative structure of the terms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "the most important symmetry in the present case is the spontaneously broken spin rotation symmetry : whereas the heisenberg model , @xmath14 is invariant under global o(3 ) spin rotations , the ground state of the ferromagnet ( @xmath15 ) is invariant under the subgroup o(2 ) only .",
    "according to the nonrelativistic goldstone theorem @xcite , we then have one type of spin - wave excitation  or one magnon particle  in the low - energy spectrum of the ferromagnet which obeys a quadratic dispersion relation .",
    "the interaction between an external constant magnetic field @xmath16 and the spin degrees of freedom is taken into account through the zeeman term . in the corresponding extension of the heisenberg model ,",
    "@xmath17 the magnetic field couples to the vector of the total spin .",
    "the above hamiltonian , defined on a cubic lattice with purely isotropic exchange coupling between nearest neighbors , represents what dyson called _ ideal _ ferromagnet .",
    "apart from internal symmetries we also have to consider the various space - time symmetries .",
    "compared to particle physics where we have lorentz invariance , the situation is more complicated in condensed matter physics , because the center of mass system represents a preferred frame of reference .",
    "moreover , the crystal lattice singles out preferred directions , such that the effective lagrangian need not be rotationally invariant . in the case of cubic geometry , however , it has been shown that the anisotropies of the lattice start manifesting themselves at higher orders of the derivative expansion @xcite  the leading - order effective lagrangian is thus invariant under space rotations . moreover , as the effective analysis refers to large wavelengths , it does not resolve the microscopic structure of the crystal : the system appears homogeneous and the effective lagrangian is also invariant under translations .",
    "the idea underlying the construction of effective lagrangians is straightforward @xcite : one writes down the most general expression consistent with the space - time symmetries and the internal , spontaneously broken symmetry g of the underlying system in terms of goldstone boson fields @xmath18 , dim(g)-dim(h ) , where the group h refers to the symmetry group of the ground state .",
    "the effective lagrangian then consists of a string of terms involving an increasing number of derivatives or , equivalently , amounts to an expansion in powers of the momentum .",
    "furthermore , the effective lagrangian method allows to systematically take into account interactions which explicitly break the symmetry g of the underlying model , provided that they can be treated as perturbations . in the present case we will include a weak external magnetic field @xmath19 .    for the o(3 ) ferromagnet , the leading - order effective lagrangian is of order @xmath20 and takes the form @xcite [ leadinglagrangian ] @xmath21 the two real components of the magnon field , @xmath22 are the first two components of the three - dimensional unit vector @xmath23 , which transforms with the vector representation of the rotation group . while the structure of the above terms is unambiguously determined by the symmetries of the underlying theory , at this order , we have two a priori unknown low - energy constants : the spontaneous magnetization @xmath24 and the constant @xmath25 .",
    "the above lagrangian leads to a quadratic dispersion relation @xmath26 obeyed by ferromagnetic magnons .",
    "it is important to note that one temporal derivative ( @xmath27 ) is on the same footing as two spatial derivatives ( @xmath28 )  in the derivative expansion , two powers of momentum thus count as only one power of energy or temperature : @xmath29 .",
    "dyson evaluated the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization up to terms of order @xmath0 or , equivalently , the partition function up to order @xmath10 .",
    "this then means that , in the effective lagrangian framework , we have to consider the expansion of the partition function up to order @xmath30 .",
    "this calculation was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we go one step further and consider the expansion beyond dyson s analysis , taking into account diagrams of order @xmath31 .",
    "as it turns out , the corresponding contributions lead to a spin - wave interaction term of order @xmath1 in the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the effective lagrangian method provides us with a simultaneous expansion of physical quantities in powers of the momenta and of the external fields .",
    "the essential point is that , to a given order in the low - energy expansion , only a finite number of effective coupling constants and only a finite number of graphs contribute .",
    "the leading terms stem from tree graphs , whereas loop graphs only manifest themselves at higher orders in the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "so the question arises as to what order in the effective expansion we have to go ",
    "i.e. , how many derivatives in the effective lagrangian we have to include and how many loops we have to consider  if we want to evaluate the partition function of a ferromagnet up to order @xmath31 .",
    "while loops are suppressed by _ two _ momentum powers in a lorentz - invariant framework , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that loop corrections involving ferromagnetic magnons are suppressed by _ three _ momentum powers . up to order @xmath30 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , we thus have to consider graphs which involve two loops at most and have to take into account pieces of the effective lagrangian involving up to six derivatives . at order @xmath31 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , three - loop graphs start to show up . at the same time we also have two one - loop graphs which involve vertices from higher - order pieces of the effective lagrangian :",
    "diagram 11d contains a vertex from @xmath32 , while diagram 11e contains insertions from @xmath7 and @xmath33 .",
    "these five graphs represent the additional diagrams we have to evaluate when we go one step beyond dyson s analysis .",
    "we now address the question regarding the explicit structure of the pieces @xmath7 , @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "first of all , note that there are no contributions to the effective lagrangian leading to odd momentum powers : the pieces @xmath34 necessarily involve terms with an odd number of space derivatives like @xmath35 which are excluded by parity ",
    "parity is a discrete symmetry of the underlying heisenberg model that has to be respected by the effective lagrangian .",
    "the next - to - leading order lagrangian is thus of order @xmath36 .",
    "it contains terms with two time derivatives , terms with one time and two space derivatives , and terms with four space derivatives .",
    "the time derivatives along with the magnetic field , however , can be eliminated with the equation of motion , such that @xmath7 takes the form @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the laplace operator in three dimensions .",
    "the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian hence involves the three effective coupling constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "an inspection of the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] reveals that insertions from @xmath33 and @xmath32 only appear in one - loop graphs : the only terms we need are thus quadratic in the magnon field . eliminating again time derivatives and terms involving the magnetic field , the pieces relevant for our calculation are @xmath41    we conclude this section with a remark concerning effects induced by the anisotropy of the lattice . regarding the cubic lattice ,",
    "we have mentioned that the anisotropies start manifesting themselves at the four - derivative level : the pieces @xmath7 , @xmath33 and @xmath32 indeed contain additional terms  not displayed in eqs.([leff4 ] ) and ( [ leff68 ] )  which are not invariant under space rotations , but still invariant under the discrete rotation and reflexion symmetries of the cubic lattice , such as @xmath42 in the present analysis , however , we neglect these extra terms and assume space rotation invariance up to order @xmath43 .",
    "the conclusions of the present paper regarding the manifestation of the spin - wave interaction in the partition function are not affected by this idealization : according to fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , the interaction contribution beyond dyson is determined by the three - loop graphs of order @xmath31 : these graphs only involve the leading - order lagrangian @xmath6 which is perfectly invariant under space rotations .",

    "@xcite and will not be given here .",
    "rather , we would like to point out two important observations , which lead to a substantial simplification of the renormalization procedure .",

    "the second observation concerns the fact that , up to order @xmath30 , the individual contributions to the free energy density from the various diagrams factorize into products of thermal propagators ( involving space derivatives or derivatives with respect to the magnetic field ) , which all have to be evaluated at the origin . as an example consider the two - loop graph 10a which yields the contribution @xmath66 according to the first observation regarding dimensional regularization , it is then clear that in the two products of thermal propagators above only the fully temperature - dependent pieces  @xmath67 and @xmath68  are nonzero , whereas any other terms involving temperature - independent pieces of propagators vanish identically . we thus conclude that , using dimensional regularization , the renormalization of the partition function up to order @xmath30 is quite trivial . as we will see in the next subsection ,",
    "the renormalization at the three - loop level , on the other hand , is more complicated , but still perfectly feasible within the effective field theory framework .    without going into more details ( the interested reader may consult ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we present the final result for the free energy density of the o(3 ) ferromagnet up to order @xmath30 : @xmath69 the first term in this series does not depend on temperature and originates from the tree graph 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",

    ". the remaining task will be the renormalization and the numerical evaluation of this integral which contains a total of four infinite sums .",

    "leaving aside these technical issues for a moment , we note that the cateye graph of order @xmath31 will lead to a term of order @xmath11 in the free energy density , @xmath88 hence the spin - wave interaction in the low - temperature series of the free energy density  beyond dyson s @xmath10-term  already manifests itself at order @xmath11 .",

    ", the function can be parametrized by @xmath133 the coefficients @xmath134 and @xmath135 are pure numbers given by @xmath136 it should be noted that , in the limit @xmath130 , the last two contributions in eq.([j bar ] ) contain terms involving the square root @xmath137 . since they have opposite signs , however , they cancel each other .    with the above representation for the quantity @xmath132 , the final result for the low - temperature expansion of free energy density for the ideal ferromagnet up to order @xmath31 takes the form @xmath138    because the system is homogeneous , the pressure can be obtained from the temperature - dependent part of the free energy density , @xmath139 accordingly , up to order @xmath31 , the low - temperature series for the pressure reads @xmath140 where the coefficients @xmath141 are given by @xmath142 in the limit @xmath143 , these coefficients become temperature independent and the sums reduce to riemann zeta functions , @xmath144 the spin - wave interaction manifests itself in the last two terms involving the coefficients @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the contribution proportional to five powers of the temperature in the pressure is the famous dyson term . in the effective theory it originates from the two - loop graphs 10a and 10b of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "our main new result concerns the manifestation of the spin - wave interaction beyond dyson : the leading correction in the pressure is of order @xmath11 .",
    "it is contained in the last term of the coefficient @xmath146 and stems from the three - loop graph 11c .",
    "note that all other contributions in the pressure up to order @xmath31 originate from one - loop graphs  those graphs describe noninteracting magnons and merely modify the dispersion relation . in the above series for the pressure ,",
    "they involve half - integer powers of the temperature : @xmath147 and @xmath11 .",
    "we have to point out that the sign of the dyson term of order @xmath10 is not determined by the symmetries  the low - energy constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 appearing in the coefficient @xmath145 may take positive or negative values , depending on the specific underlying model . for the present case of the heisenberg model ,",
    "however , dyson has derived an explicit microscopic expression for @xmath145 .",
    "as it turns out , for all three types of cubic lattices , this coefficient is positive , leading to a positive contribution to the pressure .",
    "we thus conclude that the spin - wave interaction in the ideal ferromagnet is repulsive at low temperatures .",
    "remarkably , while the sign of the coefficient of order @xmath10 is not determined within the effective theory framework , the sign of the coefficient of the subsequent interaction contribution of order @xmath11 is unambiguously fixed : the last term in @xmath146 only involves the coupling constants of the leading - order effective lagrangian @xmath6 and the coefficient @xmath134 which is a pure number ",
    "the conditions imposed by symmetry are thus very restrictive here .",
    "since the numerical value of @xmath134 is positive , the corresponding contribution to the pressure is positive as well , enhancing thus the weak repulsive interaction between spin waves at low temperatures .    finally , let us consider the low - temperature series for the energy density @xmath148 , for the entropy density @xmath149 , and for the heat capacity @xmath150 of the o(3 ) ferromagnet .",
    "they are readily worked out from the thermodynamic relations @xmath151 in the limit @xmath152 , we obtain @xmath153 again , the correction to dyson s result is contained in the respective last terms in the above series involving the coefficient @xmath146 .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the general structure of the low - temperature series for the spontaneous magnetization of the ideal ferromagnet . while this problem has attracted more than a hundred authors over the last few decades , to the best of our knowledge , a rigorous and fully systematic calculation of higher - order corrections to the dyson term has never been achieved .",
    "before we review the relevant results in the literature , let us analyze the problem within the systematic effective field theory framework .    with the expression for the free energy density ( [ freecollectorder11 ] ) , the low - temperature expansion for the spontaneous magnetization @xmath154 of the o(3 ) ferromagnet , up to order @xmath1 , takes the form @xmath155 the coefficients @xmath156",
    "are independent of the temperature and given by @xmath157 up to order @xmath0 , we reproduce dyson s series . in the effective lagrangian framework , the famous interaction term of order @xmath0 in the spontaneous magnetization originates from the two - loop graphs 10a and 10b which involve vertices from the next - to - leading order lagrangian @xmath7 .",
    "note that there is no interaction term of order @xmath5 in the above series  for many years such a spurious term has haunted the condensed matter literature .",
    "our main new result concerns the leading correction to dyson s term , which originates from the three - loop graph 11c .",
    "the correction in the spontaneous magnetization is of order @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , the corresponding coefficient  the last term in @xmath158  does not involve any higher - order low - energy constants .",
    "it only involves @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as well as the coefficient @xmath135 , which is a pure number determined by the symmetries of the underlying heisenberg model . since the coefficient @xmath135 is negative , this contribution has the same sign as the dyson coefficient @xmath159 .",
    "the effect of the three - loop contribution is thus to enhance the weak spin - wave interaction found by dyson .",
    "apart from these two interaction terms of order @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , all other temperature - dependent contributions to the spontaneous magnetization originate from one - loop graphs , which describe noninteracting magnons .",
    "they merely modify the dispersion relation or  as dyson expressed it @xcite  they merely arise _ from the discreteness of the lattice , are easy to calculate and are not of any theoretical interest_. in the above series for the spontaneous magnetization , they involve half - integer powers of the temperature : @xmath160 and @xmath1 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the contribution of order @xmath1 contains two parts : the first term in the coefficient @xmath158 is due to two one - loop graphs associated with noninteracting magnons .",
    "the second term is due to a three - loop graph and represents the dominant spin - wave interaction term beyond dyson .",
    "note that the dyson coefficient @xmath159 , on the other hand , exclusively involves an interaction part .",
    "here comes the appropriate place to compare our results with the condensed matter literature . indeed , several authors  most notably",
    ", dyson himself  also have discussed the structure of the low - temperature series for the spontaneous magnetization beyond order @xmath0 .",
    "we make our comparison along four lines of observations .",
    "our first observation is that all published calculations or estimates of higher - order interaction terms @xcite apparently failed to identify the dominant @xmath1-correction to the dyson term in the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the second observation is that there appears to be consensus in the literature on how graphs related to the _ two_-spin - wave problem should manifest themselves beyond @xmath0 .",
    "dyson classified his terms according to the quantity @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the _ number of independent particles which are concerned in the interactions which the particular term describes _",
    "for @xmath161 , which is referred to as the _ two - spin - wave problem _ in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding corrections are expected to show up at order @xmath10 according to refs .",
    "@xcite  hence these authors seem to agree on that the dominant correction to the dyson term should be of order @xmath10 in the spontaneous magnetization . however , this claim is not correct ",
    "it is in contradiction with the fully systematic effective field theory analysis which has demonstrated that the dominant correction sets in at order @xmath1 .",
    "the third observation concerns the _ three_-spin - wave problem , i.e. the effect of interaction terms with @xmath162 .",
    "dyson identified two such contributions ",
    "formulae ( 128 ) and ( 130 ) in his second article of ref .",
    "@xcite  and showed that in the spontaneous magnetization these are of order @xmath163 and @xmath10 , respectively . in the article by morita and tanaka @xcite , however , it is claimed that the _ three_-spin - wave problem starts manifesting itself at order @xmath163 , missing thus the term of order @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the fourth observation is that the only place in the literature where a feynman diagram displaying the cateye structure of graph 11c seems to have appeared , is in the more recent article by chang @xcite .",
    "however , he concludes that interactions originating from such a diagram start showing up only at order @xmath164 in the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this claim , again , is erroneous , as it contradicts the fully systematic effective theory analysis which has demonstrated that the leading term originating from a cateye graph is of order @xmath1 .    in view of the quite impressive collection of temperature powers established over the years , one may easily get confused  after all",
    ", may some of these temperature powers , again , merely be spurious ? one would certainly like to gain some deeper insight into the general structure of the low - temperature series for the spontaneous magnetization beyond the leading correction to the dyson term .",
    "let us therefore address the problem in a fully systematic way within the effective field theory framework ",
    "first on the level of the free energy density .    indeed , it is quite easy to see that corrections due to the spin - wave interaction continue to proceed in steps of @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] we have displayed some of the relevant higher - order graphs which contribute beyond order @xmath31 or , equivalently , beyond @xmath11 . at order @xmath166 in the free energy density , the two - loop graph 12a with an insertion from @xmath33 contributes , while at order @xmath163 the three - loop graph 13a with a vertex from @xmath7 is relevant .",
    "we may classify the graphs of the effective theory according to the number of loops they contain and discuss the various contributions at the level of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "interactions related to two - loop diagrams start manifesting themselves through the dyson term of order @xmath0 and then proceed in integer steps of @xmath167  these are the two - loop graphs with successive insertions from @xmath168 , giving rise to terms of order @xmath169 in the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "interactions related to three - loop diagrams start showing up at order @xmath1 .",
    "they give rise to the dominant correction to dyson s result , and then also proceed in steps of @xmath167  in the effective theory these correspond to the three - loop graphs with successive insertions from @xmath170 , leading to half - integer powers of the temperature : @xmath171 four - loop interactions are expected to enter the game at order @xmath166 .",
    "they will continue contributing to the spontaneous magnetization in ascending powers of @xmath167 through terms of order @xmath172    accordingly , the low - temperature expansion for the spontaneous magnetization of the ideal ferromagnet exhibits the following general structure : @xmath173 note that we have highlighted all terms which are related to the spin - wave interaction .",
    "we thus realize that the various published temperature powers as such are not in contradiction with the effective field theory prediction  sooner or later , the effective expansion will hit them all .",
    "the point is , however , that there are two gaps in the multitude of published temperature powers  interaction terms of order @xmath1 and @xmath11 , to the best of our knowledge , have never been identified .",
    "one may say that the effect of the spin - wave interaction on the low - temperature series for the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet is quite peculiar .",
    "on the one hand , the interaction starts manifesting itself only at order @xmath0 , i.e. far beyond the bloch term of order @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "subsequent interaction corrections closely follow the term of order @xmath0 , starting with @xmath1 and then proceeding in steps of @xmath165 .",
    "the question of how the spin - wave interaction manifests itself in the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet , has a long history .",
    "early attempts that ended up with temperature powers of order @xmath3 and @xmath4 turned out to be wrong altogether , as shown by dyson s rigorous analysis which demonstrated that the spin - wave interaction sets in only at order @xmath0 .",
    "after dyson s rather complicated analysis , there emerged an active phase of research in which many authors tried to derive the @xmath0-term in the spontaneous magnetization in a more accessible manner .",
    "it is interesting to note that this problem  using conventional condensed matter methods  indeed seems to be nontrivial , as various authors all of a sudden ended up with an interaction term of order @xmath5 in the spontaneous magnetization , thereby contradicting dyson . as it turned out ,",
    "these attempts were wrong altogether , as they were plagued with errors originating from the approximate methods used .",
    "we would like to stress that the fully systematic effective lagrangian method , based on symmetry considerations , does not display any such defects .",
    "rather , the existence of dyson s @xmath0-term  and , at the same time , the absence of a @xmath5-term  is an immediate consequence of the underlying symmetries inherent in the ideal ferromagnet .    in his collection of selected papers that appeared in 1996 , dyson comments @xcite :",
    "_ `` after 1966 , the subject of spin - wave interactions went into a long sleep . '' _ still , so it seems , sporadically over time , the peaceful sleep has been interrupted , as several authors were attracted by the problem of how the general structure of the series for the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet beyond the dyson term should look like .",
    "remarkably , not all of the various findings are consistent with one another .",
    "it was our motivation to solve this paradox , making use of the systematic and model - independent method of effective lagrangians .    as we have demonstrated in the present study , it is rather straightforward to go beyond dyson s analysis by considering three - loop effects in the effective field theory .",
    "still , the explicit evaluation at order @xmath31 is quite non - trivial as it involves the renormalization and subsequent numerical evaluation of a three - loop graph , which is proportional to an integral over a product of four thermal propagators , each one of them involving an infinite sum .",
    "the corresponding interaction term beyond dyson is completely fixed by the symmetries of the leading - order effective lagrangian @xmath6 ",
    "lattice anisotropies , showing up at higher orders in the effective lagrangian , do not affect this result .",
    "what is quite remarkable is the fact that all previous attempts to go beyond dyson apparently have failed to correctly identify this interaction term of order @xmath1 in the spontaneous magnetization of an ideal ferromagnet .",
    "we have also discussed the origin and the structure of even higher - order corrections in the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization , pointing out that they continue to proceed in steps of @xmath165 beyond the contribution of order @xmath1 . again , earlier attempts to gain insight into the general structure of this series were incorrect .",
    "the present study has thus solved  once and for all  the problem of how the spin - wave interaction in an ideal ferromagnet manifests itself in low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization beyond the dyson term .",
    "hopefully , we have convinced the reader that the effective lagrangian technique does not merely consist in rederiving known results or in rephrasing condensed matter problems in another language  rather , in many cases as in the present one , it clearly proves to be more powerful than conventional condensed matter methods , allowing one to go to higher orders of the low - temperature expansion in a controlled and systematic manner . in view of the many articles that have dealt with the problem of the manifestation of the spin - wave interaction in an ideal ferromagnet at low temperatures  concerning both the extension of dyson s series to higher orders and the confusion regarding the spurious @xmath5-term  it is quite striking how efficiently the effective theory analysis settles all these questions in a conclusive way .",
    "we do not claim to have contributed to the actual experimental situation  spin - wave interactions in a ferromagnet are very weak .",
    "above all , there are many interactions in addition to the exchange interaction in a _",
    "real _ ferromagnet , which would also have to be accounted for in a more realistic approach .",
    "while this would perfectly be feasible within the effective lagrangian framework , here we have restricted ourselves to the simple model of the _ ideal _ ferromagnet ",
    "after all , it is for this system where corrections to dyson s result have been derived over the years .",
    "although there is no such object as a perfectly ideal ferromagnet in nature , still , the `` clean '' ideal ferromagnet could be investigated in a numerical simulation of the heisenberg model and the existence of the @xmath1-term in the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization might be verified this way .",
