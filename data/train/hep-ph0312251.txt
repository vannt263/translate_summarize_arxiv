    "the @xmath2 , a @xmath3 charmonium state , has , for many years , been a nice probe of hadron physics .",
    "experimentally , it is easily detectable through its decay into a lepton pair .",
    "theoretically , it has been a testing ground of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) because it involves both long and short - distance dynamics .",
    "because of the separation between the long and short - distance scales involved in quarkonium dynamics , one can make use of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite to describe the production and decay of heavy quarkonium in a factorized form that is analogous with those in standard hard - scattering qcd factorization theorems @xcite .",
    "the factorized formula is a linear combination of long - distance nrqcd matrix elements , which scale according to a known power of the velocity @xmath4 of the quark inside a quarkonium in the meson rest frame .",
    "the matrix elements are determined by experimental measurements or , in some cases , through lattice calculations .",
    "once the universal long - distance matrix elements are determined , one only needs to calculate the corresponding perturbative short - distance factors in order to predict the value of a physical observable .    as the first effective field theory for treating heavy quarkonium physics , nrqcd succeeded in providing infrared - finite predictions of the @xmath5wave quarkonium decay rate @xcite and presented a solution to the excessively large production rates for @xmath2 and @xmath6 at large transverse momenta at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "these results were enough to rule out the color - singlet model @xcite , which had survived for decades .",
    "on the other hand , there are open questions still to be resolved in nrqcd phenomenology .",
    "one is the polarization of the @xmath2 at large transverse momentum at the tevatron : the cdf collaboration has not observed the large transverse polarization @xcite at large transverse momentum that was expected from theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental data are not yet decisive .",
    "experimental analyses with high - statistics , run - ii data are under way . on the theoretical side ,",
    "large relativistic corrections have been found  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , predictions have , so far , ignored spin - flip interactions .",
    "lattice calculations to estimate the importance of these interactions are being carried out @xcite .",
    "recently , quarkonium physics has been faced with two particularly difficult problems , both of which arise from belle measurements of @xmath2 production in @xmath1 annihilation at @xmath7gev @xcite .",
    "one production rate for inclusive @xmath8 relative to @xmath9 @xcite , which is much larger than predictions @xcite .",
    "the other is the cross section @xcite for the exclusive process @xmath10 , which is larger than predictions by at least an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "both of them are the largest discrepancies that currently exist in the standard model .",
    "in this proceeding , we review current theoretical status with regard to the exclusive problem .",
    "we first consider the original discrepancy between the data @xcite and the theory @xcite for exclusive @xmath0 production .",
    "then we summarize two recently proposed scenarios to reduce the discrepancy between the data and the theory .",
    "one scenario is that the belle signal may contain double-@xmath2 events@xcite .",
    "the other is a conjecture that the signal may include exclusive @xmath2 production associated with a glueball @xcite .",
    "according to the nrqcd factorization formalism , exclusive processes of quarkonium production and decay , in which there is no other hadrons , should be described by the color - singlet model , up to corrections that are higher order in @xmath4 . as in the simplest examples , such as electromagnetic annihilation decays and exclusive electromagnetic production processes , @xmath11 annihilation into exactly two charmonia should be accurately described by the color - singlet model , too . because of the mono - energetic nature of a two - body final state , the absence of additional hadrons in the final state can be guaranteed experimentally . for many charmonia @xmath12 ,",
    "the nrqcd matrix element can be determined from the electromagnetic annihilation decay rate of either @xmath12 or of another state that is related to @xmath12 by the heavy - quark spin symmetry .",
    "cross sections for exclusive two - charmonium production in @xmath1 annihilation can , therefore , be predicted , up to corrections that are suppressed by powers of @xmath13 , without any unknown phenomenological factors . in contrast",
    "inclusive quarkonium cross sections in hadroproduction involve several matrix elements whose values have large uncertainties .    unfortunately , cross sections for exclusive two - charmonium production were too small to be measured until the newly built high - luminosity @xmath14 factories collected large - statistics data . a naive estimate of the cross section for @xmath15 in units of the cross section for @xmath16 is @xmath17 \\ ; \\sim \\ ; \\alpha_s^2 \\left ( \\frac{m_c v } { e_{\\rm beam } } \\right)^6 .",
    "% -------------- \\label{r - psieta : est}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two powers of @xmath18 are the minimum needed to produce a @xmath19 final state . there is a factor of @xmath20 associated with the wave function at the origin for each charmonium .",
    "these factors in the numerator are compensated by factors of the beam energy @xmath21 in the denominator , which yield a dimensionless ratio . as an example , consider @xmath11 annihilation with center - of - mass energy @xmath22 gev . if we set @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 gev , we obtain the naive estimate @xmath26 \\approx 4\\times10^{-7}$ ] .",
    "this should be compared with the total ratio @xmath27 \\approx 3.6 $ ] for all hadronic final states @xcite .",
    "because the two charmonia in the final state have opposite charge - conjugation quantum numbers , it is assumed that they are produced by a single virtual photon .",
    "the four qcd diagrams for the color - singlet process @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "we take the upper @xmath29 pair in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to form a @xmath30 charmonium @xmath31 with momentum @xmath32 and the lower @xmath29 pair to form a @xmath33 charmonium @xmath34 with momentum @xmath35 .",
    "there are also qed diagrams for @xmath28 that can be obtained from the qcd diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by replacing the virtual gluons by virtual photons , but they are suppressed by a factor of @xmath36 . however if one of the charmonia is a @xmath37 state , such as a @xmath2 , then there are the additional qed diagrams in fig .",
    "although they are also suppressed by a factor of @xmath36 , they are enhanced by a kinematic factor of @xmath38 , where the variable @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40 and therefore can be more important than one might expect .",
    "the @xmath41 term in the cross section for @xmath42 was calculated previously by brodsky and ji @xcite .",
    "they presented their result in the form of a graph of @xmath43 versus @xmath38 , but they did not give an analytic expression for the cross section .",
    "our predictions for the double - charmonium cross sections without relativistic corrections are given in table  [ tab : sigma ] .",
    "the error bars are those associated with the uncertainty in the nlo pole mass @xmath44 only .",
    ".[tab : sigma ] cross sections in fb for @xmath11 annihilation into double - charmonium states @xmath45 at @xmath46 gev without relativistic corrections .",
    "the errors are only those from variations in the nlo pole mass @xmath47 gev . from ref .",
    "@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the anomalously large cross section for exclusive @xmath0 production measured by the belle collaboration is not well understood within pqcd factorization or within the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "if the belle signals are made purely of @xmath0 events , then either pqcd factorization fails or there are important production mechanisms that we have not yet taken into account .",
    "the former possibility would be a violation of an established pqcd factorization theorem .",
    "if the exclusive two - charmonium production process is demonstrated to violate the factorization theorem , then one must understand why . without a fundamental understanding",
    "this problem , one can not safely use such factorization theorems , which are a central part of most current particle phenomenology .",
