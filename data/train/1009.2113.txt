    "magnetars are strongly magnetized neutron stars powered with a super - strong magnetic field ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . there are two classes of objects which properties could be described in terms of the magnetar model : anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) . it is generally assumed that such sources spin down by magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the inferred values of the surface magnetic field strength @xmath2  g are larger than the so - called _ critical _ magnetic field",
    "@xmath3  g where the effects of quantum electrodynamics should be taken into account .",
    "this makes magnetars to be the unique natural laboratories to test such superstrong magnetic fields .",
    "however , no direct measurements of magnetic fields in magnetars have been presented so far .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite to search for proton cyclotron harmonic , which should appear in the x - ray band ( 2 - 10  kev ) due to the presence of the strong magnetic field :    @xmath4    here @xmath5 denotes the _ observed _ energy of the cyclotron feature , @xmath6 is the gravitational redshift ( @xmath7 for a typical neutron star ) , @xmath8 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "previous search revealed some features during flares and high states , which could be treated as cyclotron features , in the spectra of 7 among 19 magnetar candidates ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .    summarizing the results of table  [ tab1 ] , we note that the most of the absorption features were mainly observed during flaring stages and with moderate - resolution instruments such as rxte / pca .",
    "it was also announced about the absence of the absorption features in the _ quiescent _ spectra of axp 4u  0142 + 614 ,  @xcite , although they were predicted in earlier theoretical works  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide more extended search for cyclotron features in the quiescent spectra of magnetars .",
    "for such an analysis , a combination of good energy resolution and large effective area is necessary .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on epic cameras onboard _ xmm - newton _ satellite , extending the earlier results of  @xcite , where the same instruments were used .",
    "in this work , we used all publically available xmm - newton / epic observations with all three cameras ( e.g. mos1 , mos2 & pn ) in the _ imaging _ mode .",
    "it was done to ensure the better statistics and to prevent possible calibration uncertainties which may occur in _ timing _ mode .",
    "all event lists were cleaned from soft proton solar flares using the standard routine  http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/xmm2/xmmlight_clean.csh v.  3.3 .",
    "source and background regions were substracted manually from the image .",
    "pile - up checking was carried out with the ` epatplot ` procedure .",
    "if the predicted ratios of the single - to - double events were not equal to 1 within the ` epatplot ` error interval , such observations were not included in the subsequent analysis .",
    "after taking all reductions 41 high - quality observations for 12 objects remained .",

    "after the fitting procedure , we moved through the spectrum , adding cyclotron absorption with cyclotron absorption model ` cyclabs ` with a step of the central energy of @xmath13  ev and looked for the @xmath14 increase when setting the depths of the harmonics to zero .",
    "this robust analysis revealed three spectra from three different objects to have possible cyclotron absorptions . to estimate the significances of absorption features",
    ", we followed the procedure described in  @xcite , by running monte carlo simulations of the spectra with the help of ` xspec ` procedure ` fakeit ` and calculating the percentage of the spectra which are fitted without ` cyclabs ` component .",
    "the results are summarized in the table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the spectra of the magnetar candidate with the highest cyclotron feature significance detected are presented in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . using this procedure",
    ", we found the significances of all absorption features to be below the margin @xmath15 detection limit .",
    "[ tab2 ]    .the results of our analysis . in spite of the significant improvement of the @xmath14 value",
    ", monte carlo simulations did not reveal significant features . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "though initial theoretical works  @xcite have predicted a proton cyclotron feature of equivalent width @xmath16 , in subsequent paper  @xcite it has been shown that vacuum polarization effects strongly suppress the cyclotron absorption feature , giving the equivalent width about an order of magnitude lower .",
    "it should also be noted that the theoretical calculations of the equivalent width of the cyclotron feature were done for a local patch of the neutron star surface .",
    "phase averaged spectra , like those we are using here , would include contributions from various magnetic field strengths , directions and effective temperatures , which would further suppress the cyclotron feature .",
    "the results of our analysis indicate the absence of the significant cyclotron absorptions in the quiescent spectra of the magnetar candidates observed with _ xmm - newton _ , what could be interpreted due to combination of the two above - mentioned effects .",
