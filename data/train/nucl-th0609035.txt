    "<S> within a self - consistent thermal model using an isospin and momentum dependent interaction ( mdi ) constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions , we investigate the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath0 and symmetry free energy @xmath1 for hot , isospin asymmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the symmetry energy @xmath0 generally decreases with increasing temperature while the symmetry free energy @xmath2 exhibits opposite temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the decrement of the symmetry energy with temperature is essentially due to the decrement of the potential energy part of the symmetry energy with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the symmetry energy and symmetry free energy is found to be quite small around the saturation density of nuclear matter . while at very low densities , they differ significantly from each other . in comparison with the experimental data of temperature dependent symmetry energy extracted from the isotopic scaling analysis of intermediate mass fragments ( imf s ) in heavy - ion collisions , the resulting density and temperature dependent symmetry energy @xmath3 is then used to estimate the average freeze - out density of the imf s . </S>"
