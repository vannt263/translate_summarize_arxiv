    "pentaquark is the name for baryons made up of four quarks and one antiquark .",
    "recent advances in theoretical and experimental work led to the observation of pentaquark candidates by some experiments , however , other experiments reported no observation from their search . for more details , see the review of the experimental evidence on pentaquarks and critical discussion @xcite .",
    "the question of the existence of pentaquarks is raised again , due to the non - observation in so many experiments . to answer the question , it is important to assess the cross sections in different processes .",
    "the candidate @xmath0 peak is seen in different reactions namely of @xmath5+a , @xmath6+a , p+p , k+xe , e+d , e+p , k+xe@xcite@xcite .",
    "all of those reactions involved at least one baryon in the initial state . but other experiments , e.g. @xmath7 : babar , belle , bes , lep experiments@xcite , @xmath8 : cdf , d0 @xmath9:e690 , @xmath10 : focus , @xmath9 : hera - b , @xmath11 : zeus ( for the @xmath12 ) @xmath13 : compass , hadronic z decays : lep , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , p on a : hypercp , @xmath16 : l3 , @xmath17 on p : selex , @xmath9 : sphinx",
    ", @xmath18 : wa89 @xmath19 : lass@xcite , did not observe those candidates . because the experiments such as @xmath7 did not observe those candidates , it is generally believed a non - zero initial baryon number is essential to the pentaquark production , i.e. pp collisions or collisions involved with nuclei , as we can see the collision types of the positive reports . to check this ,",
    "we calculate in this paper the pentaquark production in @xmath1 annihilations .",
    "a theoretical comparison of pentaquark production between p+p@xcite and @xmath1 processes may be helpful to the question if pentaquarks exist .",
    "why we choose the microcanonical approach to calculate ?",
    "traditionally , the hadron production in @xmath1 scattering at high energy is treated as a two - stage process .",
    "first @xmath20 is calculated using perturbative theory",
    ". then the @xmath21 system produces hadrons phenomenologically based on string fragmentation or cluster fragmentation .",
    "pentaquark states are exotic , hard to treated within the frame of conventional string models . in this situation statistical approaches may be of great help@xcite,@xcite . it was hagedorn who introduced statistical methods into the strong interaction physics in order to calculate the momentum spectra of the produced particles and the production of strange particles@xcite . later , after statistical models have been successfully applied to relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite , becattini and heinz @xcite came back to the statistical description of elementary reactions .    according to the situations of obeying conservation laws ,",
    "statistical models are classified into four ensembles :    * microcanonical : both , material conservation laws ( q , b , s , c , @xmath22 ) and motional conservation laws ( e , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath22 ) , hold exactly .    *",
    "canonical : material conservation laws hold exactly , but motional conservation laws hold on average ( a temperature is introduced ) .    * grand - canonical : both material conservation laws and motional conservation laws hold on the average ( temperature and chemical potentials introduced ) .    *",
    "mixed ensemble : for example , to estimate particle production in heavy ion collisions , so - called partially canonical and partially grand - canonical models are employed where strangeness conserves strictly , but the conservation of net charge hold on the average .",
    "what one expects is that the microcanonical ensemble must be used for very small volumes , i.e. the systems created by the collisions between elementary particles . for intermediate volumes",
    "the canonical ensemble should be a good approximation , while for very large volumes , i.e. the systems created by heavy ion collisions , the grand - canonical ensemble can be employed .",
    "therefore we take a microcanonical approach to calculate the production of pentaquark states from electron - positron annihilations .",
    "the idea was originally proposed by fermi in its microcanonical form@xcite and realized with markov chain technique@xcite .",
    "we calculate the hadron production in @xmath1 annihilations at a given energy as a statistical decay of a cluster which carries net quark contents @xmath25 .",
    "the cluster is charactered by three parameters , cluster energy ( mass ) @xmath26 , volume @xmath27 and strangeness suppression factor @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that hadron production from the cluster is dominated by the n - body phase space .",
    "more precisely , the probability of the cluster hadronization into a configuration @xmath29 of hadrons @xmath30 with four momenta @xmath31 is given by the microcanonical partition function @xmath32 of an ideal , relativistic gas of the @xmath33 hadrons @xcite , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the energy , and @xmath36 the 3-momentum of particle @xmath37 .",
    "the term @xmath38 ensures flavour conservation ; @xmath39 is the flavour vector of hadron @xmath37 .",
    "the symbol @xmath40 represents the set of hadron species considered : we take @xmath40 to contain the pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xmath41 and the lowest spin-@xmath42 and spin-@xmath43 baryons @xmath44 and the corresponding antibaryons .",
    "@xmath45 is the number of hadrons of species @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the degeneracy of particle @xmath37 .",
    "it s well known that strangeness will be overpopulated if the hadron production is purely determined by the @xmath48-body phase space .",
    "the common treatment is to introduce so - called strangeness suppression factor @xmath28 with @xmath49 .",
    "so we employ this factor as well in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the index @xmath50 is the number of ( anti)strange components in the final - state particle @xmath51 , i.e. for kaons , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and their antibaryons , @xmath54 ; for @xmath55-meson , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 .    similar to the previous work@xcite , we add the pentaquark states @xmath2 and @xmath62 into @xmath63 .",

    "the @xmath62 can be @xmath66 $ ] , @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] or @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the spin of pentaquark states can not be determined by experiments yet , and it is generally accepted pentaquark states are spin-@xmath70 particles , so we take a degeneracy factor @xmath71 . as for strangeness suppression , @xmath54 for @xmath0 and @xmath58 for @xmath56(1860 ) .",
    "the high dimensional phase space integral is verified via constructing markov chains of hadron configurations @xmath15 .",
    "the metropolis algorithm provides random configurations @xmath15 according to the weight , the corresponding microcanonical partition function @xmath72 .",
    "all possible random configurations are included .    working with markov chains one has to worry about two kinds of convergences :",
    "the number of iterations per chain must be sufficiently big ( essentially a multiple of the so - called auto - correlation time ) , otherwise the method is simply wrong .",
    "secondly , the number of simulated chains must be sufficient large , to obtain the desired statistical accuracy .",
    "questions related to the auto - correlation time have been studied in detail in earlier publications@xcite , so that the error due to auto - correlations can be neglected .",
    "the statistical error will be treated carefully at the result section .",
    "in addition to checking auto - correlations and statistical errors , also physics cross checks have been performed : a comparison @xcite of our monte carlo method with canonical method gives a good agreement when the systems have big volumes , i.e. 50@xmath73 and high energies , i.e. 10 times the mass of observed particles .",
    "we generate randomly configurations @xmath74 according to the probability distribution @xmath32 .",
    "the monte carlo technique allows to calculate mean values of an observable as @xmath75 where @xmath76 means summation over all possible configurations and integration over the @xmath31 variables .",
    "@xmath77 is some observable assigned to each configuration , as for example the @xmath78 multiplicity @xmath79 of hadrons of species @xmath80 present in @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath81 depends on @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we usually write @xmath85 .    the cluster parameters energy @xmath26 , volume @xmath27 and strange factor @xmath28",
    "are chosen so that the cluster decay reproduces best the measured multiplicity of the selected hadrons in @xmath1 annihilations at a given energy of @xmath86 .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing @xmath87 : @xmath88^{2}}{\\sigma _ { j}^{2 } } \\label{eq : ccc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the experimentally measured multiplicity and its error of some selected hadron species @xmath91 in @xmath1 collisions at an energy of @xmath86 .",
    "with the cluster parameters determined by the selected hadrons , we can predict the multiplicity of any particles included in the hadron species list , i.e. pentaquark states from @xmath1 collisions at the energy of @xmath86 .",
    "we calculate pentaquark production from @xmath1 collisions at @xmath92  gev .",
    "this is realized by two steps : first , we have to determine the cluster parameters energy @xmath26 , volume @xmath27 and strange factor @xmath28 for each collision energy @xmath93 ; then , we use the obtained cluster parameters to calculate pentaquark production .    for the first step : with data taken from @xcite , we select @xmath94 and their antiparticles to determine the cluster parameters energy @xmath26 , volume @xmath27 and strange factor @xmath28",
    ". the available experimental yields of other particles are used to check the reliability of our results . for each set of parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the multiplicities of selected hadrons are calculated from 10,000 random hadron configurations so that the relative statistical errors of the selected hadrons are within 0.03 .",

    "fig.1 tells that the best - chosen cluster parameters with the experimental multiplicities of @xmath95 from @xmath1 collisions at the energy of @xmath96  gev can also reproduce very well the yields of other particles such as @xmath97 .",
    "the less well reproduced particles are @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , spin-1 meson and spin-@xmath101 baryons .    at the energy of @xmath102  gev , the best - chosen cluster parameters with the experimental yields of @xmath95 can also reproduce very well the yields of other particles such as @xmath103 .    at the energy of @xmath104  gev , the best - chosen cluster parameters with the experimental yields of @xmath95 from @xmath1 collisions can well reproduce the yields of other particles such as @xmath105 .",

    "the small @xmath108/dof indicates a good fit quality .",

    ", there is a lot of collective kinetic energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 means the sum of the energies of volume elements in their proper frames , in other words their invariant masses .",
    "so this effective mass is much smaller than the mass of the total system , which is of course @xmath1 energy @xmath4 .",
    "if we only consider total yields , we do not need to specify the details of the collective expansion .",
    "the price is that this simple 3-parameter model can not make any statements about transverse momentum spectra or rapidity spectra .",
    "the volume we find here is much bigger than that in fermi s model @xcite , where the volume is estimated according to the colliding particles with the lorentz contact . in our case ,",
    "the volume @xmath27 is the size of the collision system at the moment of hadronization .",
    "after @xmath1 annihilates , the collision system gets many quark pair production and expanding with time .",
    "so the size is much much bigger than that of an electron and a positron .",
    "the strangeness suppression factor @xmath28 changes very little with the collision energy @xmath4 .",

    "<S> the existence of pentaquarks , namely baryonic states made up of four quarks and one antiquark , became questionable , because the candidates , i.e. the @xmath0 peak , are seen in certain reactions , i.e. p+p collisions , but not in others , i.e. @xmath1 annihilations . in this paper , we estimate the production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath1 annihilations at different energies using fermi statistical model as originally proposed in its microcanonical form . </S>",

    "<S> we find that , if pentaquark states exist , the production is highly possible in @xmath1 annihilations . </S>",
