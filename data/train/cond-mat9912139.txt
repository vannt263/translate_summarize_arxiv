    "the full scale terrestrial gravitational wave antennae are now in the process of assembling and tuning .",
    "it is expected that in the year 2001 in one of these antennae ( project ligo - i ) the sensitivity in units of amplitude of the perturbation of metric will be at the level @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this value means that the optical readout system will be able to register small displacement between two test masses ( two heavy optical mirrors placed in vacuum pipe at the distance @xmath1 cm ) with the resolution @xmath2  cm .",
    "this displacement may be produced by a burst of gravitational wave generated in astrophysical catastrophe .",
    "the characteristic frequency in this wave packet and , correspondingly , in the displacement @xmath3 has to be of the order of @xmath4  s@xmath5 .",
    "the improvement of the readout system and better isolation of the mirrors from different sources of noise will permit to achieve higher sensitivity : in the year 2005 the planned level of sensitivity has to be better than @xmath6 and correspondingly it will be necessary to register @xmath7  cm .",
    "it is worth noting that in the prototype ligo ( where @xmath8  cm ) the already achieved resolution was @xmath9  cm @xcite .",
    "the important feature of this antenna is that the optical readout system does not register displacements between the centers of the mirrors masses but between the internal surfaces of the mirrors .",
    "these surfaces are coated by several thin dielectrical layers , which provide high optical reflectivity of the mirrors and high sensitivity to the displacements .",
    "the necessity to measure the displacements between the internal surfaces inevitably determines the requirement for high quality factors @xmath10 ( small loss angle ) of internal mechanical modes of the mirrors , which provide relatively small values of random thermal fluctuations of the mirrors related to the mirrors center of mass because the value of @xmath11 is substantially smaller than the eigen - frequencies of internal modes .",
    "we shall call as brownian the fluctuations which are usually calculated from phenomenological model of structural losses in the material in order to distinguish them from another type of thermodynamical fluctuations which we describe below .",
    "this requirement for high @xmath12 determines the choice of the mirrors material . on the first stage of ligo",
    "the mirrors are made of very pure fused silica ( @xmath13 ) , because the values of @xmath14 exceed @xmath15 @xcite .    at present the possibility to make the mirrors for the second stage of ligo from sapphire monocrystal ( @xmath16 )",
    "is widely debated , because more than 20 years ago the achieved value of @xmath17 for this material was @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we show below that the value of @xmath19 is not the only parameter which determines the choice of material from which the mirror has to be manufactured . till",
    "now the experimentalists interest has neen concentrated on the reduction of the brownian motion of the mirrors surfaces ( as it was described above ) , to the reduction of thermal fluctuations of the centers of mirrors masses due to the friction in the mirrors suspension @xcite and to excess noise in the suspensions @xcite . to our best knowledge",
    "nobody has so far paid attention to nonlinear effects which may be `` responsible '' for additional fluctuations of the mirrors surface , which may exceed traditional brownian noise for low frequencies .",
    "the simplest of these effects is thermal expansion , originated from anharmonisity of interaction potential of atoms in solid state .",
    "the following numerical example illustrates the role of nonzero value of thermal expansion coefficient @xmath20 of the mirrors material .",
    "suppose that the surface layer of the mirror having thickness @xmath21  cm ( it is the characteristic length of the decay of fourier thermal wave at frequency @xmath22 in fused silica ) is heated due to some process on @xmath23 .",
    "then the distance between the surface of the mirror and its center of mass will also change on the value of @xmath24 : @xmath25    the estimate ( [ deltal ] ) shows , that if the mirrors are made of fused silica and if the temperature of the first layer ( @xmath26  cm thick ) of the mirror changes by 2 nk during @xmath27  s then the antenna will register a `` burst '' of gravitational radiation with amplitude of the order of @xmath28 with @xmath29  s.    the aim of this article is to present the results of the analysis of the two effects which are `` responsible '' for random fluctuations of temperature in the bulk of the mirrors and which may mimic at certain level the gravitational wave if @xmath30 : photo - thermal shot noise ( due to random absorption of optical photons in the surface layer of the mirror ) and thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature .    as in both effects",
    "we are interested in the fluctuations of the coordinate averaged over the spot on mirror surface with radius @xmath31  cm of laser beam , which is much smaller than the radius of mirror @xmath32  cm , we replace the mirror by half - space : @xmath33 .",
    "we consider also for simplicity this half - space to be isotropic ( the anisotropy of different constants for sapphire is not very large ) .",
    "the role of these two effects for the condition to reach the standard quantum limit of frequency stability was analyzed more than 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "as at room temperature the power radiated from the surface ( stephan - boltzmann law ) is much lower than the heat exchange due to thermal conductivity ( fourier law ) , below we use the simplified boundary condition : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the deviation of temperature from the mean value @xmath36 .    for the calculations we use",
    "approximation in which we neglect the effects of limited speed of sound but take into account thermal relaxation .",
    "the multilayer coating of the mirrors absorbs a fraction of power @xmath37 of the optical beam , circulating between the mirrors of fabry - perot resonator .",
    "this fraction for the best existing today coatings has not been measured with good precision yet , but for estimates the usually accepted value of this fraction is approximately equal to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath37 sufficient to reach @xmath28 ( which is close to standard quantum limit ( sql ) of sensitivity ) is approximately @xmath39 or @xmath40  photon / s @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to estimate that each mirror absorbs @xmath41  erg / s or @xmath42  photon / s .",
    "each absorbed optical photon having energy @xmath43  erg gives birth to a bunch of approximately 50 thermal phonons .",
    "each of these phonons has a relatively short free path @xmath44 ( for @xmath13 and @xmath16 the values are @xmath45  cm and @xmath46  cm @xcite ) .",
    "after a very short time interval which is a few times longer than @xmath47  s ( where @xmath48 is the speed of sound ) these phonons will produce a local jump of temperature inside the coating @xmath49  cm thick . as we want to know the variance of temperature during the averaging time @xmath50  s which is several orders longer than @xmath51 and as during this time a large number ( @xmath52 ) of photons are creating bunches of thermal phonons  it is reasonable to use the model of shot noise .",
    "as the length @xmath53 is much smaller than the radius of laser beam @xmath54  cm for semi - qualitative analysis one can use one dimensional model , described by thermal conductivity equation : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 is thermal conductivity , @xmath58 is density and @xmath59 is specific heat capacity .    assuming that displacement @xmath60 ( which is of interest ) is proportional to temperature @xmath35 averaged along the axis @xmath61 @xmath62 it is not difficult to obtain the spectral density of @xmath60 : using formula @xmath63 ]    @xmath64    for the exact calculations for half - space ( see appendix a ) we introduce the displacement @xmath65 averaged over the beam spot on the surface @xmath66 where @xmath67 is @xmath61-component of vector of deformation on the surface , and find the spectral density of @xmath65 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the poisson coefficient .    here and",
    "below we use the fact that for materials at room temperature the thermal relaxation time of the spot @xmath70 is very large : @xmath71    it is easy to see that the exact solution ( [ sdsn ] ) differs from the approximate one ( [ sdts1d ] ) only by poisson coefficient .",
    "it is known from thermodynamics @xcite that the total variance of fluctuations of temperature in volume @xmath72 is described by the following simple formula : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the boltzmann constant . in classical solid state thermodynamics these fluctuations",
    "are not correlated with fluctuations of volume ( which are responsible for the brownian noise ) @xcite but this is not the case for nonzero thermal expansion coefficient . to find the influence of the fraction of this type of fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath11 on the vibration of the surface along the x - axis in direct way we use the langevin approach and introduce fluctuational thermal sources @xmath75 added to the right part of the equation of thermal conductivity : @xmath76    these sources should be normalized in a way to satisfy formula ( [ tvar ] ) . by substituting the solution of this equation for the temperature @xmath35 into the equation of elasticity and averaging displacement ( [ barx ] ) over the spot on the surface , we find spectral density of its fluctuations in frequency range of interest ( see details in appendix b ) : @xmath77    we can also find the spectral density of displacement using fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) if we assume that the only dissipation mechanism in the mirror is thermoelastic damping .",
    "elastic deformations in a solid body through thermal expansion lead to inhomogeneous distribution of temperature and hence to fluxes of heat and losses of energy @xcite .",
    "the same approach was used @xcite for the calculation of vibration of the surface due to the brownian fluctuations . to calculate the fluctuations in this approach",
    "we should apply a periodic pressure @xmath78 distributed over the beam spot on the surface : @xmath79 and we should find susceptibility @xmath80 .",
    "after that in accordance with fdt the spectral density of displacement @xmath65 must be proportional to imaginary part of susceptibility @xmath81 : @xmath82    calculations ( see appendix c ) show that fdt gives the same result as formula ( [ sdtd ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature are the physical source of fluctuations deduced from fdt based on thermoelastic damping .",
    "calculations of @xmath83 are rather bulky but zener @xcite suggested a very simple approach allowing to estimate thermoelastic loss angles and hence the imaginary parts of elastic coefficients .",
    "it allows to find @xmath84 only from formula for @xmath81 in zero order approximation ( see appendix c ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the young s modulus .",
    "the imaginary parts of elastic coefficients due to thermoelastic damping may be calculated in zener s approach according to the formulas",
    "@xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 are consequently iso - thermic and adiabatic young s moduluses ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 are iso - thermic and adiabatic poisson coefficients ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 is the time of thermal relaxation of our spot . by substituting these values in ( [ rigidity ] ) and then in ( [ spectrum ] ) and taking into account that @xmath93 ( this relaxation time may be found relatively easy from the solution of the problem of thermal relaxation of the heated spot ) we finally obtain the same formula ( [ sdtd ] ) .",
    "it is really worth noting that all the three methods give precisely the same result .",
    "now we want to compare the fluctuations of the mirrors surface caused by the described above mechanisms with other known sources of noise in ligo antennae .",
    "the main determining source of noise associated with the mirrors material is usually described by the losses in the model of structural damping ( we denote it as brownian motion of the surface ) . in this model",
    "the angle of losses @xmath94 does not depend on frequency and analogously to @xcite by substituting @xmath95 in ( [ rigidity ] ) and then in ( [ spectrum ] ) we obtain : @xmath96 for simplicity here we neglected the unknown imaginary part of poisson coefficient .",
    "the sensitivity of gravitational wave antenna to the perturbation of metric may be recalculated from noise spectral density of displacement @xmath97 using the following formula : @xmath98 where we used the fact that antenna has two arms ( with length @xmath99 ) and in each arm only one mirror adds to noise ( on end mirrors the fluctuations are averaged over the larger beam spot )",
    ".    the ligo - ii antenna will reach the level of sql , so we also compare the noise limited sensitivity to this limit in spectral form @xcite : @xmath100    on figures 1 and 2 we plot the sensitivity limitations for the perturbation of metric caused by the described thermal mechanisms and sql ( formulas [ sdsn],[sdtd],[sdsd],[hsd],[hsql ] ) for fused silica ( fig.1 ) and sapphire ( fig.2 ) mirrors .",
    "we used the following numerical values for the parameters of the two materials  fused silica and sapphire .",
    "( we should note that the actual figures , which various sapphire manufactures provide , significantly vary  tens of percents , especially for the thermal expansion coefficient ) :",
    "@xmath101    from these two figures it is evident that the effects associated with thermal expansion in no case may be neglected .",
    "especially unfortunate result is obtained for sapphire ",
    "the noise from thermodynamical fluctuations of temperature dominates for frequencies of interest and is several times larger than the sql . while for fused silica the situation is the opposite .",
    "the sql is one order larger than td fluctuations .",
    "it is important to note , that unlike structural damping for which angles of losses at low frequencies were not yet directly measured , our mechanism has fundamental nature and is calculated explicitely without model assumptions .",
    "the analysis and numerical estimates presented above for two effects allow to give some recommendations for the strategy of upgrading laser interferometric gravitational wave antennae .",
    "it is important to emphasize that contrastingly to the gravitational wave , both effects do not displace the centers of masses of the mirrors .",
    "thus , in principle it is possible to subtract these effects as well as usual brownian fluctuations ( with certain level of accuracy ) in a way similar to the procedure suggested for the subtraction of thermal noise in suspension fibers @xcite .",
    "however , till now to our knowledge nobody presented the scheme of such subtraction .",
    "potentially there exists a possibility to decrease substantially these effects by choosing materials for the mirrors with substantially smaller values of @xmath20 .",
    "there also exists the possibility to use special cuts of anisotropic monocrystals for which @xmath20 turns to zero .",
    "thermodynamic fluctuations decreese with growing radius of the beam spot as @xmath102 even stronger then for the brownian fluctuations . in this way , some optimization of the geometry of the resonators may help .",
    "the `` brute force '' method for the improvement of the sensitivity by increasing the circulating optical power @xmath37 does not look promising , taking into account photo - thermal shot noise .",
    "it seems that few mega - watts is the upper limit for @xmath37 .",
    "the evident method to suppress the thermodynamical fluctuations by using larger beamspots is unfortunately limited by diffraction losses and technology . if we choose the ligo - i geometry with beam sizes on internal and end mirrors : @xmath103 then the threshold of sensitivity of thermodynamical fluctuations will be only 1.7 times lower than on our graphics still 2 times higher than the sql .",
    "we are pleased to thank for helpful discussions v.p.mitrofanov , f.ya.khalili , a.i.osipov , i.a.kvasnikov , h .- j.kimble and r.weiss .",
    "this research was partially supported by the california institute of technology , us national science foundation and the russian foundation for basic research grant # 96 - 15 - 96780 .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the spectral density ( [ sdsn ] ) of the fluctuations of the averaged displacement @xmath65 caused by photo - thermal shot noise .",
    "we start from thermal conductivity equation : @xmath104 with boundary condition ( [ boundarytc ] ) and equation of elasticity for the field of deformation @xmath105 ( see @xcite ) with boundary conditions for tensions on free surface : @xmath106      \\right|_{x=0}=0 ,     \\\\ & & \\sigma_{xy}=\\left.\\frac{e}{2(1+\\sigma)}\\left (          \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial y}+          \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial x}\\right )              \\right|_{x=0}=0 , \\qquad      \\sigma_{xz}=\\left.\\frac{e}{2(1+\\sigma)}\\left (          \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial z}+          \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\right|_{x=0}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the problem ( [ tcsn ] , [ boundarytc ] ) in half - space can be replaced by the problem ( [ tcsn ] ) in full space , in which the function of source is evenly continued for negative @xmath61 . in this case",
