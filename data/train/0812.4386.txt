    "in a previous article @xcite , referred to as paper i , we have established the general approach for the square gradient description of the interface between two phases in non - equilibrium mixtures .",

    "some profiles were given , without going into details of the numerical procedures used to obtain them .",
    "in this paper we will do this .    in the general description of the interface one uses contributions to the helmholtz free energy density proportional to the square of the density and mass fraction gradients .",
    "these contribution imply that it is not possible to use _ continuous local equilibrium thermodynamics _ in the interface , i.e. to calculate the local values of the various thermodynamic parameters in terms of the local density , mass fractions and temperature only .",
    "rowlinson and widom ( see @xcite ) use the name _ point thermodynamics _ for this to distinguish it from other _ quasi_- or _ local thermodynamic _ treatments .",
    "given the non - autonomous nature of the square gradient model , it is sensible to question whether a description in terms of excess variables along the lines given by gibbs @xcite , can be autonomous .",
    "gibbs treatment , though only given for equilibrium systems , suggested such an assumption .",
    "this would imply that the surface is a separate thermodynamic phase .",

    "this property was verified for one - component systems .",

    "in order to calculate the various profiles in the non - equilibrium mixture a complete set of equations is required .",
    "this set is given by the hydrodynamic balance ( conservation ) equations , the thermodynamic equations of state and the phenomenological force - flux relations .",
    "these equations were given ( derived ) and discussed in paper i , to which we refer .",
    "in this paper we will only list them for the stationary case .      in a stationary state",
    "the conservation equations take the following form .",
    "the law of mass conservation is @xmath6where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass density and the barycentric velocity . furthermore @xmath9 is the mass fraction of the first component and @xmath10 is the diffusion flux of the first component relative to the barycentric frame of reference .",
    "momentum conservation is given by @xmath11where we call @xmath12 the thermodynamic tension tensor , which will be defined below",
    ". furthermore @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pressures parallel and perpendicular to the interface , for the planar interface under consideration . for curved surfaces",
    "see paper i. energy conservation is given by @xmath15where @xmath16 is the total energy flux , @xmath17 is the heat flux , and @xmath18 is the total specific energy and @xmath19 is the specific internal energy .",
    "the gradient model , discussed in the first paper @xcite gives the following expressions for the specific helmholtz energy @xmath20 , the specific internal energy @xmath19 , the parallel pressure @xmath13 , the chemical potential difference @xmath21 , the chemical potential of the second component @xmath22 and the @xmath23-element of the tension tensor @xmath24 : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the specific helmholtz energy of the homogeneous phase , which can for instance be derived from the equation of state .",
    "furthermore @xmath27 is the gradient contribution , where the primes indicate a derivative with respect to @xmath4 . since the equation of state",
    "is usually given in molar quantities , it is convenient to use them here as well .",
    "thus , @xmath28 is the molar concentration , @xmath29 is the molar fraction , where @xmath30 is the molar mass of the mixture , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are molar masses of each component .",
    "this energy is given by the following equation @xmath33 where the de broglie wavelength @xmath34 and the characteristic sum over internal degrees of freedom w are respectively .",
    "@xmath35    expressions for the characteristic sums over internal degrees of freedom for each component , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are given in paper i. in this paper they are assumed to be independent of the temperature and the molar fractions , i.e. just constant numbers .",
    "the mixing rules for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are @xmath40 with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 as well as @xmath43 is a coefficient of a pure component @xmath44 .",
    "we will assume in this paper that @xmath45 are independent of temperature .",
    "this contribution is given by the following general expression for a binary mixture @xmath46 the coefficients @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be expressed in the gradient coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 for components 1 and 2 in the following way ( see paper i for details ) @xmath52 where we use the mixing rule @xmath53 similar to the one for coefficients @xmath45 for the cross coefficient .",
    "we will assume @xmath54 to be independent of the densities in this paper .    with the above mixing rules",
    "the gradient contribution can be written in the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",

    "equals the density .",
    "for the two - component mixture @xmath64 plays a similar role as the density for the one - component fluid . we shall therefore refer to @xmath64 as the order parameter .",
    "the size of the coefficient @xmath65 depends on the nature of the components of the mixture . in an organic mixture like cyclohexane and n - hexane , a mixture we will study in more detail in this paper , the components are very similar and as a consequence @xmath65 is small",

    "i we derived the general expression for the entropy production of a mixture in the interfacial region . for a non - viscous binary mixture which has only gradients and fluxes in the @xmath2direction it takes the following form @xmath68",
    "the resulting linear force - flux relations are : @xmath69 the resistivity coefficients @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 will in general depend on the densities , their gradients as well as on the temperature , so they vary through the interface .",
    "expressions for the resistivity profiles in the interfacial region are not available .",

    "the entropy production then takes the following form : @xmath92 where we have suppressed the superscript @xmath84 for now .",
    "the subscript @xmath93 of @xmath94 indicates that the gradient is calculated keeping the temperature constant .",

    "@xmath113 changes monotonically with @xmath112 or @xmath111 , and it is therefore a good measure for the composition . since @xmath117 , the value of @xmath118 gives the difference of the chemical potentials of two components .    to obtain the equilibrium profiles @xmath119 and",
    "@xmath120 one needs to solve a system of two differential equations @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the molar masses of the components .",
    "this system of equations is , in fact , singular , since coefficients of the higher derivatives are proportional .",
    "thus , we can derive one algebraic equation instead of a differential one .",
    "@xmath125    the ` bvp4c ` procedure takes only differential equations , so we have to transform eq .   to a differential one .",
    "this can be done easily by taking derivative of both sides .",
    "after some transformations , we have the following equation set @xmath126 where subscripts @xmath103 or @xmath102 mean partial derivative of the corresponding quantity with respect to @xmath103 or @xmath102 .",
    "this is the system of 3 first order differential equations for 3 variables @xmath103 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which requires 3 boundary conditions .",
    "one of them is eq .   taken on one of the boundaries , which simply determines the integration constant for the second differential equation .",
    "the other two are @xmath129 and @xmath130 which indicate the fact , that box boundaries are in the homogeneous region .",
    "numerical procedure allows any values of the variables .",

    "in order to avoid out - of - range problems , we use the function which safely maps unit interval to real axes and vice versa : @xmath133 particularly , the actual variables , we provide to ` bvp4c ` procedure are @xmath134 where @xmath135 is simply the derivative of @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the limiting value for @xmath127 .",
    "non - equilibrium conditions are implemented when we change temperature or pressure from their equilibrium values .",
    "this results in mass and heat fluxes through the interface .",
    "the amount of matter will then change in the gas and liquid phase .",
    "we will put the system in such conditions , that the total contents of the box is constant and equal to the equilibrium contents .",
    "it means , that if some amount of liquid has been evaporated , the same amount of gas is condensed externally and put back into the liquid phase .",
    "we introduce the overall mass @xmath138 and the mass of the 1st component @xmath139 , which obey the following equations by definition @xmath140 we introduce the the overall mass flux @xmath141 , the mass flux of the 1st component @xmath142 , the energy flux @xmath143 and the `` pressure '' flux @xmath144 : @xmath145 from subsec .",

    "one can see from these data , that within different ways of perturbing mixture from equilibrium the biggest error comes when one perturbs the temperature on the liquid side .",
    "this is the most extreme condition for the mixture being in non - equilibrium .",
    "while the relative temperature perturbation is only 2% , the resulting temperature gradient is about @xmath355 k / m which is very far beyond ordinary non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the other perturbations make the validity of local equilibrium for the surface more precise .",
    "similarly smaller perturbations make the validity of local equilibrium also more precise .",
    "we therefore conclude that the local equilibrium of the surface is valid with a reasonable accuracy .",
