    "at the moment , there are three classes of experiments that provide positive indications for neutrino oscillations : solar neutrino data from seven different experiments , chlorine , kamiokande , super - kamiokande , sage , gallex , gno , sno , all experiments giving evidence for missing electron neutrinos emitted from the solar core , which can be understood in terms of neutrino oscillations@xcite ; atmospheric neutrino data from super - kamiokande which has not only confirmed earlier indications of a muon neutrino deficit but also has provided more precise data that has established at a high confidence level that the muon neutrinos from the cosmic rays are oscillating to tau neutrinos@xcite .",
    "these two evidences are on very solid footing .",
    "the third piece of evidence is from the los alamos lsnd experiment that shows an oscillation from the muon neutrino to the electron neutrino .",
    "this experiment however has neither been been confirmed nor refuted by other experiments@xcite . the karmen@xcite experiment which looked for @xmath0 oscillation did not find any evidence for it and eliminated a large fraction of the parameter space allowed by lsnd .",
    "it is hoped that the mini - boone experiment at fermilab will settle the issue in near future .",
    "theoretical analyses have made it clear that explanation of the observations in terms of neutrino oscillations require that the three mass differences @xmath1 for the solar case , @xmath2 for the atmospheric case and @xmath3 for explaining lsnd are all of very different orders of magnitude .",
    "this poses a theoretical problem for models with only three active neutrinos since with three neutrinos , one can at most have two different mass differences .",
    "the simplest way to provide a simultaneous understanding of all the above mentioned oscillation data appears to be to postulate the existence of an additional ultralight neutrino , which in order to be consistent with the lep data must be a sterile neutrino@xcite .    in the presence of a sterile neutrino",
    ", there are several ways to understand the observations .",
    "we mention only two of them , one called 2 + 2 scheme@xcite and another called 3 + 1 scheme@xcite in the literature .",
    "the 2 + 2 scheme has the @xmath4 neutrinos with mass around an ev and @xmath5 with mass near @xmath6 ev , with the later explaining the solar neutrino data , the former explaining the atmospheric neutrino data and the gap between the two pairs explaining the lsnd results .",
    "recent sno data disfavors the original version of the model where all the missing solar @xmath7 s are converted via a small angle msw mechanism only to the sterile neutrinos .",
    "the situation where only a fraction of the missing @xmath7s convert to @xmath8s and the rest to active ones has been studied in several papers@xcite .",
    "a particular challenge in this model would be to fit both the sno super - kamiokande gap and the more or less flat neutrino energy distribution observed in both the sno and super - kamiokande experiments .    in the 3 + 1 picture ,",
    "on the other hand , it is assumed that the three active neutrinos are bunched together at a small mass value ( say around @xmath9 ev or so ) , with the sterile neutrino at a mass near an ev .",
    "the atmospheric and solar neutrino data is explained by the oscillations among active neutrinos whereas the lsnd data is explained by indirect oscillations involving the sterile neutrino@xcite .",
    "the advantage of this picture in view of the sno data is that the flat energy spectrum is explained by postulating bimaximal@xcite mns mixing pattern among the active neutrinos and using the large mixing angle msw solution .",
    "the sno - super - kamiokande gap is understood in terms of the neutral current interactions of the @xmath10 s to which the solar @xmath7 s convert .",
    "it must however be pointed out that 3 + 1 pattern works only for certain values of the @xmath11 as has been noted in ref.@xcite and there are papers noting that it may have problem accomodating all accelerator and reactor constraints as well as the positive signals for oscillation@xcite and yet have room in its parameter space to explain the lsnd results .",
    "if experiments ultimately establish the existence of a sterile neutrino , a key theoretical challenge would be to understand its origin in the context of physics beyond the standard model , specially why its mass is so small even though it has no electroweak quantum numbers .",
    "most existing scenarios postulate new fermions beyond the conventional seesaw framework i.e. new singlet fermions beyond the three right handed dictated by quark lepton symmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "they are usually taken to be mirror neutrinos@xcite , extra singlet fermions@xcite or modulinos@xcite , @xmath12 singlets@xcite or bulk neutrinos@xcite as in models with large extra dimensions .",
    "our goal in this brief note is to point out a more economical possibility .",
    "we show that when one tries to obtain the exact bimaximal form for the mns matrix in the framework of the seesaw@xcite mechanism , there appear new symmetries of the neutrino mass matrix in special limits that predict that one of the right handed neutrinos , which normally would have been superheavy , remains massless whereas the other two are superheavy as expected in the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the massless right handed neutrino can therefore be identified with the sterile neutrino , providing not only a completely new picture for the sterile neutrino but also connecting it to the bimaximal mixing among the active neutrinos .",
    "slight departures from the bimaximal pattern endow this massless sterile neutrino with an ultralight mass as well as mixings with the active neutrino , so that one can now use this to understand known oscillation data .",
    "the resulting picture is the 3 + 1 type discussed above .",
    "thus if the 3 + 1 scenario stands the test of time , the model discussed in the present paper would provide an interesting minimal theoretical scenario that would connect two apparently different phenomena without going beyond the usual quark lepton symmetric framework .",
    "let us start by writing down the generic bimaximal mns mixing matrix with the definition : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the flavor and mass eigenstates .",
    "@xmath16 when @xmath17 , we will refer to this as the exact bimaximal limit alluded to above .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the most general mass matrix involving the active neutrinos , which leads to the strict bimaximal pattern in the basis where the charged leptons are mass eigenstates is @xmath18 this mass matrix has a permutation symmetry @xmath19 operating on the @xmath10 and @xmath20 .",
    "let us call this @xmath21 since it acts only on the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "in the limit of exact @xmath22 gauge symmetry of the electroweak interactions , this symmetry will also have consequences for the charged lepton masses ( i.e. @xmath23 masses ) .",
    "the difference of the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 mass will then be attributed to its breaking .",
    "note that the gauge interactions are invariant under @xmath21 .    in the matrix @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath27 are three free parameters . in order to further relate the bimaximal mixing to symmetries of the leptonic world",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", the matrix @xmath26 has the symmetry @xmath29 symmetry@xcite in addition to the @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "let us therefore consider the combination of @xmath30 as a symmetry of the weak leptonic lagrangian to zeroth order .",
    "the next step in our discussion is the seesaw@xcite mechanism which provides an explanation of the small neutrino masses . in order to implement this",
    ", we will include three right handed neutrinos in the theory ( to be denoted by @xmath31 ) in the standard model .",
    "this makes the theory quark lepton symmetric .",
    "if we denote the mass matrix for the right handed neutrinos as @xmath32 , then the complete @xmath33 mass matrix involving the dirac mass and majorana mass for the neutrinos can be written as @xmath34 when @xmath32 is not a singular matrix , one can obtain the mass matrix for the light neutrinos as @xmath35 this is the so - called type i seesaw formula(see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand when @xmath32 matrix is singular , this means that it has one or more zero eigenvalues and one must `` take them out '' of the matrix before using the seesaw formula to obtain the light neutrino mass matrix . in this case , one of the three righthanded neutrinos will have a mass which is far below the seesaw scale .",
    "if it has a dirac mass with one or more of the left handed neutrinos at the tree level , its mass will be its dirac mass , which , apriori , can be quite large ( of order or less than the weak scale ) . without further restriction ,",
    "the light right handed neutrino in general is not light enough to qualify as the desired ultralight sterile neutrino needed for understanding the oscillation data .",
    "on the other hand , if the theory has the symmetry dictated by the mass matrix discussed above i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 operates on the righthanded neutrinos , then the dirac mass connecting the massless righthanded neutrino to the left handed neutrinos vanishes and the eigenvector of the righthanded neutrino mass matrix corresponding to the zero eigenvalue emerges as a viable candidate for the sterile neutrino .",
    "its tree level mass is zero .    to study this in detail ,",
    "note that the symmetries of the theory force the @xmath32 to take the form @xmath38 the dirac mass for the neutrinos that connects the left and the right handed neutrinos takes the form @xmath39 note that both the @xmath40 and @xmath32 have one zero eigenvalue each .",
    "they correspond to the linear combinations @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the seesaw mechanism now can be applied to the remaining @xmath43 matrix to yield the following light neutrino mass matrix in the original @xmath44 basis .",
    "@xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "this matrix on diagonalization leads to the strict bimaximal mns matrix given above .",
    "we thus see that in the strict bimaximal limit there are two massless neutrinos : one , @xmath47 is an active left - handed neutrino and the other , @xmath48 is a right handed neutrino , that has no weak interactions of fermi strength .",
    "the latter can therefore play the role of a sterile neutrino .",
    "the special case of the mass matrix in equation ( 8) @xmath49 ) predicts an inverted spectrum for neutrinos and oscillation of atmospheric muon neutrinos dictated by the @xmath50 ; it is however not realistic since it leads to @xmath51 and therefore predicts no oscillation of the solar neutrinos . in order to make this model useful",
    ", we must add small corrections to it .",
    "such corrections to the mass matrix can arise once the @xmath52 as well as the permutation symmetries are broken . in that case",
    "both the sterile neutrino mass as well as its mixings with the active neutrinos can arise . in the next section ,",
    "we give an example of a model for this case .",
    "to study such realistic situations , let us consider the case , when @xmath52 and @xmath37 are broken softly in the higgs sector .",
    "an example of a mass matrix with this symmetry breaking can be of the form ( in the basis @xmath53 , where @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 ( note that it still respects the permutation symmetry @xmath21 ) , diagonalization of this mass matrix in the approximation @xmath56 , leads to the following form for the generalized @xmath57 mns matrix @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this form leads to @xmath62 as before ; however , now we have @xmath63 making it possible to understand solar neutrino deficit in terms of the large mixing angle msw solution .",
    "clearly a cancellation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 is required for this purpose . to see the extent of fine tuning , note that , we get for the lsnd mixing @xmath66 .",
    "if we choose @xmath67 ev ( the lsnd mass ) and lsnd mixing to be @xmath68 , then we get @xmath69 ; so to get the right order of magnitude for the @xmath70 , we need fine tuning at the level of one per cent or so .",
    "the extent of fine tuning needed is less severe for lower values of @xmath11 e.g. for @xmath71 ev , the required fine tuning is at the level of 10% . in this model @xmath72 but @xmath73 which may be accessible to future high precision disappearance searches for @xmath7 s .",
    "this may qualify as a realistic 3 + 1 scenario .",
    "in this section , we discuss theoretical schemes where by extending the standard model to include the right handed neutrinos and several extra higgs fields , one can obtain the almost bimaximal mass matrix that leads to the mns matrix discussed in the previous section .",
    "one may use other alternative schemes such as the use of higher dimensional terms that include higgs fields that break both the @xmath52 and @xmath37 symmetry . here",
    "we give an example of only the first kind .",
    "the radiative scheme uses only the standard model gauge group with the right handed neutrinos to implement the seesaw mechanism and to get the massless sterile neutrino , as has already been discussed .",
    "the leptonic multiplets @xmath74 are @xmath21 multiplets , singlets @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the @xmath37 multiplets .",
    "the extra higgs fields included are : iso - singlet singly ( positive ) charged fields @xmath77 , @xmath78 , iso - singlet doubly ( positive ) charged fields @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where the superscripts correspond to the @xmath81 quantum numbers ( @xmath82 means even and @xmath83 means odd under permutation ) and subscripts to @xmath52 quantum numbers",
    ". we also include an extra standard model like doublet @xmath84 in addition to the usual higgs doublet @xmath85 .",
    "the standard model lagrangian is then augmented by the inclusion of the then following terms : @xmath86 where we have denoted @xmath21 even and odd lepton doublet combinations by @xmath87 , @xmath37 odd rh neutrino combination as @xmath88 ( previously called @xmath8 ) and @xmath37 even and odd combinations of the charged leptons as @xmath89 .",
    "we assume all the new fields to be in the tev scale .",
    "this is an extra assumption which is at the same level as , say , the @xmath24 problem of supersymmetry and presumably can be solved once the nature of physics beyond the standard model becomes more clear .",
    "using these interactions , one gets at the two loop level@xcite ( for a generaic diagram , see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 as well as @xmath93 contributions to the @xmath57 neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the magnitude of these contributions are @xmath94 where we assume @xmath24 to be of order of the weak scale . for @xmath95 ,",
    "this gives the new contributions to the neutrino mass matrix of order .1 - 1 ev , which can then lead to a realsitic picture for all three neutrino oscillations ( solar , atmospheric and lsnd ) .",
    "the charged lepton sector can be made diagonal using appropriate number of higgs fields which we do not discuss here .    in conclusion , it is pointed out in this brief note that there may be an intimate connection between the exact bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix and the possible existence of a light sterile neutrino within the conventional seesaw picture for neutrino masses .",
    "this connection arises from new symmetries of the neutrino mass matrix that yield the exact bimaximal mns matrix .",
    "the resulting scenario is a 3 + 1 scheme for understanding the present neutrino oscillation data , which , though highly constrained at the moment , may still be a viable possibility",
    ". a crucial prediction of these models is the inverted spectrum for neutrinos .",
    "this work is supported by the national science foundation grant no .",
    "it was presented at one of the p4 sessions of the snowmass 2001 workshop ; he would like to thank the organizers for a very stimulating workshop .",
    "* note added : * it is possible to show that there is a connection between the near bimaximal neutrino mixing and the existence of a light sterile neutrino if the theory has a smaller symmetry @xmath96 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath37 symmetry acts only on the right handed neutrinos . as a result",
    "the charged lepton sector is as in the standard model .",
    "this is the subject of a forthcoming article .",
