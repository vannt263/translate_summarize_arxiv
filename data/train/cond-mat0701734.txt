    "a mesoscopic single josephson junction is an interesting physical object for testing quantum mechanics at a macroscopic level . in current - biased josephson junctions ,",
    "the measurements of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) are performed by switching the junction from its metastable zero - voltage state to a non - zero voltage state ( see fig .  1 ( d ) ) . until now",
    ", experimental investigations of mqt have been focused on @xmath2-wave ( low-@xmath0 ) junctions only .",
    "this fact is due to the naive preconception that the existence of the low energy quasiparticles in the @xmath3-wave order parameter of a high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductor  @xcite may preclude the possibility of observing the mqt .",
    "recently we have theoretically investigated the effect of the nodal - quasiparticle on mqt in the @xmath3-wave @xmath1-axis junctions ( e.g. , bi2212 intrinsic josephson junctions  @xcite and cross whisker junctions  @xcite )  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the effect of the nodal - quasiparticle gives rise to a super - ohmic dissipation  @xcite and the suppression of the mqt due to the nodal - quasiparticle is very weak .",

    "@xmath6  @xcite have experimentally observed the mqt in the @xmath1-axis ( bi2212 intrinsic ) junctions .",
    "they reported that the effect of the nodal - quasiparticle on the mqt is negligibly small and the thermal - to - quantum crossover temperature is relatively high ( 0.5@xmath71k ) compared with the case of the low-@xmath0 and the ybco bi - epitaxial junctions . in jin @xmath4 @xmath6 s experiment , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the number of the stacked junctions ) enhancement of the mqt rate was reported .",

    "the andreev reflection coefficient for the electron ( hole)-like quasiparticle @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is calculated by solving the eigenequation ( 6 ) together with the appropriate boundary conditions . by substituting @xmath55 into the formula of the josephson current for unconventional superconductors ( the tanaka - kashiwaya formula )  @xcite , @xmath56 we can obtain @xmath15 dependence of the josephson current . here , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the fermionic matsubara frequency . in the case of low temperatures ( @xmath60 ) and",
    "the high barrier limit ( @xmath61 ) , we get @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the normal state resistance of the junction and @xmath67 is the number of channel at the fermi energy ) .    by substituting the josephson current into eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we can obtain the analytical expression of the potential @xmath68 i.e. , @xmath69 as in the case of the @xmath2-wave and the @xmath1-axis junctions  @xcite , @xmath37 can be expressed as the tilted washboard potential ( see fig .",
    "next we will calculate the dissipation kernel @xmath33 in the effective action ( 2 ) . in the high barrier limit , the quasiparticle current",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath70 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the transmission coefficient of the barrier i , @xmath72 is the quasiparticle surface density of states ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 or @xmath13 ) and @xmath75 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the explicit expression of the surface density of states was obtained by matsumoto and shiba  @xcite . in the case of @xmath44 , there are no zes",
    ". therefore the angle @xmath76 dependence of @xmath77 is the same as the bulk and is given by @xmath78 on the other hand , @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 the delta function peak at @xmath81 corresponds to the zes . because of the bound state at @xmath81 , the quasiparticle current for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 junctions is drastically different from that for the @xmath10 junctions in which no zes are formed . by substituting eqs .  ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) into eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we can obtain the analytical expression of the quasiparticle current @xmath82 . in the limit of low bias voltages ( @xmath83 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath84 ) ,",
    "this can be approximated as @xmath85 in the calculation of @xmath34 for the @xmath12 junctions , we have replaced the zes delta function @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) with the lorentz type function , i.e. , @xmath87 in order to avoid a mathematical difficulty and model the real systems ( which include e.g. disorder and many body effects ) .",
    "it is apparent from eq .",
    "( 13 ) that , in the case of @xmath10 junctions , the dissipation is of the super - ohmic type as in the case of the @xmath1-axis junctions  @xcite .",
    "this can be attributed to the effect of the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "thus the quasiparticle dissipation is very weak . on the other hand , in the case of the @xmath11 junctions ,",
    "the node - to - zes quasiparticle tunneling gives the ohmic dissipation which is similar to that in normal junctions  @xcite .",
    "therefore the dissipation for the @xmath11 junctions is stronger than that for the @xmath88 junctions .",
    "moreover , in the case of the @xmath12 junctions , the zes - to - zes quasiparticle tunneling dominates the quasiparticle dissipation .",
    "the broadening of the zes peak @xmath89 is typically one order magnitude smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , due to the prefactor @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the quasiparticle dissipation in the @xmath12 junctions becomes enormously stronger than that for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 cases .    from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the asymptotic form of the dissipation kernel is given by @xmath92 the result for @xmath10 junction is in agreement with previous works  @xcite .",

    "( 17 ) @xmath103 is the renormalized mass due to the high frequency components ( @xmath104 ) of the quasiparticle dissipation .    in order to compare the influence of the zes and the nodal - quasiparticle on the mqt more clearly , we will estimate the mqt rate ( 17 ) numerically . for a mesoscopic bicrystal ybco josephson junction  @xcite ( @xmath105mev , @xmath106f , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) ,",
    "the mqt rate is estimated as @xmath109 as expected , the node - to - zes and zes - to - zes quasiparticle tunneling in the @xmath110 and @xmath12 junctions give strong suppression of the mqt rate compared with the @xmath111 junction cases . moreover in the @xmath12 cases , the mqt is almost completely depressed .",
    "in conclusion , mqt in in - plane high-@xmath0 superconductors has been theoretically investigate and analytically obtained the formulae of the mqt rate which can be used to analyze experiments . the node - to - node quasiparticle tunneling in the @xmath111 junctions gives rise to the weak super - ohmic dissipation as in the case of the @xmath1-axis junctions  @xcite . for the @xmath110 junctions , on the other hand , we have found that the node - to - zes quasiparticle tunneling leads to the ohmic dissipation .",
    "moreover , in the case of the @xmath12 junctions , the zes - to - zes quasiparticle tunneling gives very strong ohmic dissipation so the mqt is drastically suppressed .    in this paper",
    "we have considered the high barrier limit case ( @xmath61 ) only . in the low barrier cases ,",
    "the zes becomes split into two finite energy andreev levels due to the zes resonance  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the energy of the split andreev levels depends on the phase difference @xmath15 and the influence of the proximity effect becomes more important . to take into account such effects ,",
    "the present approach should be considerably modified .",
