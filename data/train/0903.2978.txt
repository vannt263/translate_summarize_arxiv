    "the subject of light scattering by small particles is present in several scientific areas such as astronomy , meteorology or biology  @xcite .",
    "the first model by lord rayleigh in 1871 dealt with light scattering by particles whose dimensions are small compared to the wavelength .",
    "a significant improvement came with the mie solution  @xcite which describes light scattering by spherical particles of any size .",
    "this extension is important in astronomy and meteorology where light can go through aerosols which are particles dispersed in the atmosphere . in section  [ sec : mie ]",
    ", we study the mie series for the light scattering on dielectric spheres in air . in an apparently different domain ,",
    "the scattering of a low energy electron by atoms studied by ramsauer  @xcite showed surprising structures , and it took several years before the solution was imagined by bohr : describe the electron as a plane wave  @xcite ! the ramsauer effect is certainly the first phenomenon showing the wave properties of matter .",
    "this framework has since then been used to describe very different types of collisions such as atom - atom  @xcite or even neutron - nucleus  @xcite .",
    "our idea is that since light behaves like a wave , it should be also possible to apply ramsauer s ideas to the light scattering by dielectric droplets .",
    "the ramsauer effect is described in section  [ sec : ramsauer ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : application ] , we compare the predictions of mie and ramsauer for the total scattering cross section of light over a rain drop .",
    "the mie solution is detailed in the [ app : mie ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be the radius of the sphere , let @xmath1 be the index of refraction of the dielectric , and let @xmath2 be the total cross section . in the context of light scattering , the extinction efficiency factor @xmath3 is often used .",
    "figure  [ fig:1].(a ) shows , for three values of the index of refraction , @xmath4 as a function of the size parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the wave number of light outside the sphere .",
    "each curve is characterized by a succession of maxima and of minima with superimposed ripples .",
    "the amplitude of the large oscillations and of the ripples grows with @xmath1 . in the next sections we will show that all these features can be understood with the ramsauer approach .",
    "the ramsauer effect was discovered in 1921  @xcite while studying electron scattering over argon atoms . the total cross section versus the electron energy showed a surprising dip around @xmath7ev . in figure  [ fig:2 ] we see recent measurements of electron over krypton and neutron over lead nucleus .    the idea to model the phenomenon is to consider the incident particle as a plane wave with one part going through the target and another which is not ( figure  [ fig:3 ] )",
    "the two parts recombine behind the target and then interfere with each other , producing the oscillating behaviour . depending upon the impact parameter @xmath8 ,",
    "light rays going through the drop accumulate a phase shift ( figure  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath9 is given in the  [ app : ramsauer ] , @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "note that the first multiplicative factor of equation  [ eq:1 ] explains the fact that the amplitude of the large oscillations grows with @xmath1 .",
    "the extension efficiency factors , when plotted against @xmath12 , show a universal shape ( see figure  [ fig:1].(b ) ) . our model and",
    "the mie prediction are in good agreement for the three refractive indices used in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "a small fraction of light , internally reflected ( ir ) twice , will also contribute to the forward flux .",
    "the amplitude of the internal reflection coefficient @xmath13 is small ( @xmath14 for visible light upon water drop in air ) .",
    "the phase shift will be roughly @xmath15 .",
    "thus the main ramsauer extinction efficiency factor @xmath9 is modulated by the internal reflection factor @xmath16    finally , the global extinction efficiency factor is @xmath17",
    "if we consider visible light ray ( @xmath18 m ) on a drop of water ( @xmath19 ) in air , the mie and the ramsauer predictions are compared in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the mie solution is a series with more than @xmath20 terms that has to be computed for each value of the abscissa . on the contrary ,",
    "the ramsauer approach is a purely analytical function ( equations  ( [ eq:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:2 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) with clear physical concepts .",
    "the ramsauer model reproduces quite well both the amplitude and the peak positions of the mie prediction , except for the main peak position which is lower by almost @xmath21 . at small parameter values ,",
    "the two curves differ .",
    "the analytical formula  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , obtained under the light ray approximation , is not expected to be a good description of the reality when the wavelength of the incident light is very much larger than the size of the droplet .",
    "this is the rayleigh regime where the cross section behaves as @xmath22 . in terms of the variable @xmath23 , this implies , as @xmath24 , a @xmath25 behaviour whereas our formula approaches a parabola . even though the small ripples are also present , they look more attenuated in the ramsauer curve .",
    "another particularity of our model is that it justifies the ratio between the ramsauer - pseudo period and internal reflection - pseudo period .",
    "since one has already determined the phase difference for each case , it is straightforward to derive their ratio using the equations that require constructive interferences for the @xmath26-axis , @xmath27 in the case of a raindrop with @xmath28 , there is thus a factor @xmath29 between the two pseudo periods",
    ". therefore , we have a simple physical explanation for the origin of the oscillations at two frequencies , and we have derived the ratio of their periods .",
    "the ramsauer framework allows also , through the huygens - fresnel principle , to calculate the unpolarized differential cross section .",
    "this is developped in  [ app : differentialcrosssec ] where ramsauer and mie are compared on a particular example .",
    "we have shown that within the experimental errors the ramsauer effect predicts an extinction efficiency factor comparable to the one given by the mie solution .",
    "the large oscillatory behaviour is understood as the consequence of the interference between the fraction of light going through and the fraction avoiding the drop .",
    "the origin of the small ripples can be traced back to the internally reflected light interfering with the other two components .",
    "the authors thank their collaborators b.  kgl , p.  eschstruth , d.  veberi and the referees for the improvements due to their comments on the manuscript .",
    "the theory describing the scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a homogeneous sphere was originally presented by gustav mie  @xcite .",
    "particles with a size comparable to the wavelength of visible light are relatively common in nature . the laws describing the total scattered intensity as a function of the incident wavelength and the characteristics of the particle are much more complex than the one for the rayleigh scattering .",
    "the @xmath30 dependence of the total scattered intensity in the rayleigh case is not true anymore in the general case for the mie solution .",
    "thus the extinction efficiency factor @xmath3 depends on the radius and the relative refractive index of the particle .",
    "the mie theory uses maxwell s equations to obtain a wave propagation equation for the electromagnetic radiation in a three dimensional space , with appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the sphere .",
    "the extinction efficiency factor obtained is @xmath31    the mie scattering coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 are functions of the size parameter @xmath5 and of the relative index of refraction @xmath1 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 are the riccati - bessel functions ( the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument ) related to the spherical bessel functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 through the equations @xmath40    numerically , an infinite sum can not be computed .",
    "thus it is necessary to truncate the series and keep enough terms to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation .",
    "the criterion developed by bohren cf in  @xcite was obtained by extensive computations .",
    "the number of required terms @xmath41 has to be at least the closest integer to @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , for a raindrop of @xmath43 m radius and a visible wavelength of @xmath44 m , the number of required terms is @xmath45 .",
    "nowadays , the computers have reached a point where the computing time is no longer a problem , nevertheless it is interesting to compare to an approximate closed form method in order to obtain some insights of the different physical processes .",
    "the plots of the mie solutions are obtained using the _ fast mie algorithm _ of pawel gliwa  @xcite for total cross sections and the _ mieplot _ program of philip laven  @xcite for differential cross sections .",
    "in the scattering theory , the wave function far away from the scattering region must have the form @xmath46    the optical theorem reads as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the forward scattering amplitude . under the approximation for the scattering of a scalar",

    "nevertheless , from a purely geometrical viewpoint , a collision occurs if the distance between the two sphere centers is less than @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the radii of the two spheres .",
    "so the geometrical cross section is equal to @xmath76 . in our case ,",
    "the photon may be considered as a particle with a diameter equal to its reduced wavelength @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , equation  ( [ eq : b8 ] ) becomes @xmath78 .",

    "therefore our formula applies only to unpolarized light scattering .",
    "let us first have a reminder about the huygens - fresnel principle .",
    "the propagation of light can be described with the help of virtual secondary sources .",
    "every point of a chosen wavefront becomes such a secondary source and the light amplitude at any chosen location is the integral of all these sources emitting spherical waves towards that observation point .",

    "the amplitude distribution of the secondary sources can be split into two parts : an undisturbed plane wave and a perturbation over cd only .",
    "the undisturbed plane wave , when integrated , gives a dirac delta function in the forward direction .",
