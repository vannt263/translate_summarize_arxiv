    ", we consider the problem of minimizing the downside risk associated with an investor s total wealth in a certain incomplete market model .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath2 be the price of a riskless asset with the dynamics @xmath3 , @xmath4 the prices of the risky assets , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the number of shares of @xmath7th security .",
    "then the total wealth that the investor possesses is defined as @xmath8 and we assume a self - financing condition , @xmath9 when setting the proportion of the portfolio invested in the @xmath7th security as @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 and the total wealth is denoted by @xmath12 , which is the solution to this stochastic differential equation for a given strategy @xmath13 .",
    "let us consider minimizing the probability @xmath14 for a given target growth rate @xmath15 by selecting portfolio choice @xmath16 .",
    "let us make clear the meaning of the probability . if we choose strategy @xmath17 , then we have @xmath18 thus , the probability is always @xmath19 for large time @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "accordingly , in considering the above minimization , we investigate the extent for which we can improve the probability by selecting a strategy , as compared with the trivial strategy of investing the total wealth in a riskless asset . the latter strategy is considered the benchmark in terms of finance .",
    "we shall consider the asymptotic behavior of the probability @xmath21 according to the theory of large deviation , it is natural to relate ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to @xmath22\\ ] ] for @xmath23 .",
    "namely , as @xmath1 , @xmath24   \\biggr )   \\to   -\\inf_{k\\in ( -\\infty,\\kappa]}\\sup_{\\gamma<0}\\{\\gamma k-{\\hat\\chi}(\\gamma)\\}\\ ] ] is expected to hold since the legendre transform @xmath25 of @xmath26 , @xmath27 is regarded as the rate function of the asymptotics , if @xmath26 is a convex function ; cf .",
    "note that we can see from hlder s inequality that@xmath28=\\log e[e^{\\gamma\\log({{v_t(h)}/{s_t^0}})}]$ ] is a convex function of @xmath29 , but this does not always imply the convexity of its infimum @xmath30 = \\inf_{h_{\\cdot}}\\log e\\bigl[e^{\\gamma\\log ( { { v_t(h)}/{s_t^0}})}\\bigr].\\ ] ] therefore , the convexity of @xmath31 can not be determined immediately and the above idea does not directly apply . in the present paper , we will find the convexity of @xmath32 by identifying the solution of the h - j - b equation of ergodic type with the limit value ( [ eq1.3 ] ) ; cf .",
    "proposition  [ prop4.2 ] and corollary  [ cor4.1 ] .",
    "then we shall see that the duality relation between ( [ eq1.2 ] ) and ( [ eq1.3 ] ) holds under suitable conditions , as expected ; cf .",

    "minimization ( [ eq1.4 ] ) , which is equivalent to power utility maximization , could be regarded as a risk - sensitive control problem .",
    "the infinite time horizon counterpart of ( [ eq1.4 ] ) without a benchmark , @xmath33,\\ ] ] has been extensively studied as risk - sensitive control ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a benchmarked case has recently been reported in @xcite . from the viewpoint of stochastic control theory , it may appear more natural , compared with the above relationship between ( [ eq1.2 ] ) and ( [ eq1.3 ] ) , to relate @xmath34\\ ] ] to @xmath35 which is considered in the present paper as well ; cf .",
    "theorem  [ theo2.5 ] .",
    "we note that the problem relating ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to ( [ eq1.3 ] ) is thought to be equivalent to considering @xmath36 and @xmath37\\ ] ] without a benchmark . however , the arguments in this article may be simpler than in the case without a benchmark ( cf .",
    "remark  [ rem2.2 ] ) .    in previous papers @xcite , we studied similar asymptotic behavior without benchmarks for linear gaussian models in relation to the asymptotics of risk - sensitive portfolio optimization .",
    "indeed , we established a duality relation between these problems , and as a result , an explicit expression of the limit value of the probability minimizing downside risk for each case of full and partial information . to obtain those results ,",
    "the key analysis involved poisson equations derived by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath29 of the h - j - b equations of ergodic type corresponding to risk - sensitive control over an infinite time horizon .",
    "since the solutions of the h - j - b equations can be explicitly expressed as quadratic functions by using the solutions of the riccati equations for linear gaussian models , analysis of the differentiability of the solutions of the riccati equations with respect to @xmath29 was essential in those works .    in the present paper , we shall consider general diffusion market models and discuss the above - mentioned duality relation between the asymptotics of the minimization of downside risk and the risk - sensitive stochastic control for large time .",
    "since the solutions of h - j - b equations of ergodic type do not always have explicit expressions , we need to consider , in general , the differentiablity with respect to @xmath29 of h - j - b equations of ergodic type .",
    "the analysis is presented in sections  [ sec5 ] and  [ sec6 ] based on the results concerning h - j - b equations of ergodic type and related stochastic control problems given in sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] . here",
    ", we mention the ongoing work of hata and sheu @xcite , which is closely related to the present paper and examines similar problems under the assumptions that @xmath38 in ( [ eq2.2 ] ) in section  [ sec2 ] is bounded and that @xmath39 for @xmath40 in place of ( [ eq2.20 ] ) .",
    "we shall explain more precisely the relationships between these papers in remark  [ rem2.3 ] .",
    "we note that maximization of an upside chance probability for the long term was studied by pham @xcite for continuous time models , and then by stettner @xcite for discrete time models , in relation to risk - sensitive portfolio optimization in the risk - seeking case . by regarding the maximization problem as large deviation control",
    ", pham established a duality relation between these two types of problems . explicit calculation of the limit value is given in the case of 1-dimensional gaussian models .",
    "the problem was later extended to a nonlinear case by hata and sekine @xcite and also to the partial information case by hata and iida @xcite for 1-dimensional gaussian models .",
    "see also related works @xcite .",
    "however , asymptotic estimates of downside risk probabilities and upside chance probabilities can not be obtained in parallel .",
    "indeed , obtaining the estimates of downside risk is rather difficult than those of upside chance and further analysis of h - j - b equations is required to show the estimates as was shown in @xcite .",
    "further note that large deviations control ( [ eq1.7 ] ) is an unconventional optimization problem , and thus we need to employ a new approach to study it .",
