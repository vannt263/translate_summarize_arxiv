    "<S> we present an inas - gasb - based system in which the electric - field tunability of its 2d energy gap implies a transition towards a thermodynamically stable excitonic condensed phase . </S>",
    "<S> detailed calculations show a 3 mev bcs - like gap appearing in a second - order phase transition with electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we find this transition to be very sharp , solely due to exchange interaction , and so , the exciton binding energy is greatly renormalized even at small condensate densities . </S>",
    "<S> this density gradually increases with external field , thus enabling the direct probe of the bose - einstein to bcs crossover .    the long search for a condensed phase of excitons </S>",
    "<S> has greatly expanded in recent years@xcite . although theoretically recognised three decades ago@xcite , experimental indications of the existence of such a phase emerged only recently . in @xmath0 bulk samples , the time - evolution of the excitonic line - shape@xcite , as well as macroscopic ballistic transport of excitons@xcite , are the most remarkable manifestations of the appearance of an exciton condensed phase . </S>",
    "<S> indications of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) condensate under strong magnetic field in semiconductor heterostructures were also reported@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two major obstacles interfere in forming an exciton condensate . </S>",
    "<S> one is the short recombination lifetime ( @xmath1 ) of photo - excited direct excitons . </S>",
    "<S> this time can be shorter than the time free excitons need to thermalize and condense . </S>",
    "<S> the recombination rate also produces enough heat to possibly destroy the condensate . in @xmath2 , its unique crystal structure results in a dipole - forbidden recombination time of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a usual way to increase the exciton lifetime in 2d structures is to introduce a wide barrier material between separated electron and hole materials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure , however , also reduces the electron - hole ( e - h ) coulombic interaction , and so decreases @xmath4 , the critical temperature for condensation .    </S>",
    "<S> the second obstacle is the usually more favorable formation of an e - h droplet . </S>",
    "<S> although that liquid phase may have a non - zero condensate order parameter , this is usually suppressed by the interactions leading to the formation of the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested@xcite that a strong magnetic field should reduce the interaction between excitons , thus favoring their quantum condensation . </S>",
    "<S> sophisticated heterostructure design has also been proposed@xcite to overcome the droplet formation .    </S>",
    "<S> both of this obstacles are immediately eliminated if the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system is a condensed excitonic phase . </S>",
    "<S> such is the case in a system with an excitonic instability@xcite , namely a system with a semiconducting - like band structure , but with a single - particle energy gap which is smaller than the exciton binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> excitons now form spontaneously , and the recombination lifetime is infinite . compared to the unstable semiconducting ( `` vacuum '' ) state , the excitonic state has negative energy , while a state of free e - h plasma has a positive energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at temperatures lower than the original energy gap , even if an e - h droplet forms , it must have a non - zero order parameter , and the excitonic phase exists even at high densities .    </S>",
    "<S> if , in addition to being unstable , the system allows external control over the original energy gap , then another important feature arises : the density of the exciton condensate can be externally controlled , and different density - regimes can thus be probed in an otherwise identical system .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a realistic 2d system which exhibits an excitonic instability . </S>",
    "<S> the specific structure we propose can be readily fabricated by existing epitaxial techniques . </S>",
    "<S> its 2d band structure is very sensitive to externally applied electric fields . in particular , by applying electric field , one can continuously open an energy gap ranging from zero to a few mev . </S>",
    "<S> the negative ( semimetallic ) case is not discussed here .    </S>",
    "<S> we rigorously study the properties of the system using the keldysh - bcs theory , described later . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the large - gap state , we find an excitonic - condensate phase transition which occurs exactly when the gap reaches the value of the exciton binding energy @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> closing the gap further results in an increase of the condensate density @xmath6 , up to a density of @xmath7 at zero energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is twice the exciton bohr radius ( @xmath9 is the reduced effective mass ) . in the theory </S>",
    "<S> we use zero temperature , and isotropic band structures of the underlying materials . </S>",
    "<S> however , in view of the instability - origin of the condensed phase , finite temperature , warping , and imperfections should not change the results significantly ( as long as the temperature is well below the energy of the original gap ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a prototype of the studied heterosystem was described in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its energy profile is shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> in this staggered - gap system , the valence band edge in the gasb layer lies above the conduction band edge of the inas layer . due to the strong mismatch between valence and conduction states , </S>",
    "<S> a thin ( _ i.e. _ , 2 - 4 atomic layers ) alsb barrier is enough to suppress any e - h coupling between the active materials@xcite , and we have a regular semimetallic parabolic band structure . </S>",
    "<S> such a thin barrier , however , has a negligible effect on the interlayer coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we designate this case as case ( i ) . without an alsb interlayer , </S>",
    "<S> there exists quantum mechanical coupling between the two layers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of the system is then composed of 2 w - shaped bands@xcite , and the particles at the band edges are of mixed type . </S>",
    "<S> this is case ( ii ) .    in both cases , small electric fields applied across the heterostructure </S>",
    "<S> greatly change its band structure . in case ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> the band overlap decreases with field , until a zero gap is reached , beyond which a semiconductor energy gap opens . </S>",
    "<S> this gap now increases with applied field at a rate of @xmath10 . in case ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> , the band structure is an indirect - gap - semiconductor one , with the main effect of the field being the shift of the band extrema towards larger wavenumbers . in this case </S>",
    "<S> an unticrossing energy gap of value 2 - 5 mev is present at any field . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is possible to reduce the value of the gap by means of a very narrow alsb barrier , or any other degradation of the gasb - inas interface . </S>",
    "<S> these results are summarized in insets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the total charge in the system can be independently controlled by means of a double - gated structure with in - plane leads@xcite , so we are allowed to consider a neutral sample even if the structure is originally unintentionally doped .    </S>",
    "<S> an excitonic instability happens in cases ( i ) , ( ii ) when the gap is smaller than the exciton binding energy @xmath5 . in case ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> the particles at the band edges are of mixed type , so @xmath5 is much reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore treat in this work only case ( i ) , where no coupling is allowed . the formal way to treat </S>",
    "<S> the instability is by renormalization of the band structure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to a bcs - like procedure , where the electrons and holes play the role of opposite - spin particles in the regular bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of the theory can be summarized in terms of @xmath11 , the bcs gap function , which describes the band renormalization , and @xmath6 , the condensate density . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath12 , @xmath6 is actually the exciton density , and the condensed phase is a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of the kosterlitz - thouless type . in the opposite limit , @xmath6 designates the density of `` cooper pairs '' , which are zero momentum e - h complexes in the cooper - pairing sense . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between the two regimes is believed to be continuous@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the present system as an experimental platform to examine this bec to bcs crossover .    to formulate the theory we start with the e - h hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the electron and hole energies ( before renormalization ) , measured from their respective band edges , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 , @xmath16 the dielectric constant , and @xmath17 is the sample area . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are electron and hole annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> the structure factors @xmath20 are found to be :    [ struct ] @xmath21 \\\\     </S>",
    "<S> f^{eh}(q ) & = & \\frac{16\\pi^4}{\\zeta_e \\zeta_h }       \\frac{\\left ( 1 - e^{-\\zeta_e } \\right )       \\left ( 1 - e^{-\\zeta_h } \\right ) } {      ( \\zeta_e^2 + 4\\pi^2 ) ( \\zeta_h^2 + 4\\pi^2 ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the widths of the wells . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the structure factors reduce the binding energy , as well as the bcs gap , by more than a factor of three , as compared to the truly 2d case .    as usual@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by making a bogoliubov transformation of @xmath24 , which results with a numerical ( not operator ) term in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> minimizing this term with respect to the transformation constant leads to the generalized bcs equations :    [ bcs ] @xmath25    here @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the energy gap .    the integral term in eq .  ( [ bcsa ] ) results from the particle - particle fock energy . </S>",
    "<S> when this term is set to zero , the system ( [ bcs ] ) becomes the regular bcs gap equation . </S>",
    "<S> we show later that the fock term qualitatively alters the results . in particular , due to this term </S>",
    "<S> , the transition to the excitonic phase is very sharp .    </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of the self - consistent equations ( [ bcs ] ) are the bcs gap function @xmath29 , which determines the renormalized spectrum @xmath30 , and the condensate density@xcite @xmath31 which includes here spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bcs ] ) can be solved analytically in the limits of large and small densities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the condensed state is found by solving eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bcs ] ) in the first approximation in @xmath32 , where they become : @xmath33 this is exactly the schrdinger equation for the excitonic problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore concluded that the condensed state starts to form precisely when the gap @xmath28 equals the exciton binding energy , regardless of the shape of the spectrum , and the finite width of the wells .    to solve the problem completely , </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath34 to obtain a single equation @xmath35    by solving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ single ] ) we analyze the excitonic condensate as a function of the original energy gap of the unstable - spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> results for @xmath6 and @xmath36 are shown in figs .  2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap is easily controlled experimentally by means of a perpendicularly applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> starting from large gaps we reach a second order phase transition when @xmath37 . below @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , the condensate density grows gradually towards its value of @xmath38 at @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the results near @xmath39 are of less significance , due to the fact that small deviation from @xmath40 would change the picture . </S>",
    "<S> screening effects are also expected to become important for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we see that for @xmath42 , where low finite temperatures should not have an effect , all density regimes are present .    the same phase transition is also seen by considering the gap function @xmath36 . unlike the bcs behavior </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath11 is a nonmonotonic function of the wavenumber @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is solely due to the exchange interaction term , which acts effectively as negative kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> when exchange is not neglected , @xmath44 assumes negative values at small wavenumbers , and the maximum of @xmath11 occurs roughly when @xmath44 crosses zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of @xmath11 , @xmath45 , is a measure of the strength of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> its value , about 3 mev , indicates that the condensate should be readily observed at helium temperatures in fair - mobility samples . the fock term in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bcs ] is again responsible for the nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be understood if negative values of @xmath44 are considered as corresponding to single - particle semimetallic spectrum . then , reducing @xmath28 is equivalent to increasing the semimetallic overlap , which is known@xcite to reduce @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious way to experimentally identify the formation of the condensate is to measure the dependence of the optical absorbtion edge on electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done directly , or by measuring the typical temperature for the temperature - activated conductivity of the system . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a wide - gap structure , the edge , which is at @xmath46 , the minimum value of @xmath47 , is located at an energy @xmath28 , with a separated excitonic peak at @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> closing the gap by application of field shifts these signals to lower energies , and diminish the exciton peak , until it totally vanishes when @xmath37 . beyond this point , the absorbtion edge steeply increases with decreasing field , and that is identified with the formation of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath46 dramatically increases for @xmath49 , while the excitons are still well separated , @xmath12 , means that the exciton binding energy is greatly enhanced when the excitons form a bec . </S>",
    "<S> this renormalization of @xmath5 is attributed to the interaction between excitons , which is repulsive , and comes about through the particle - particle exchange term . </S>",
    "<S> although this interaction can be small for small densities , it greatly affects the binding energy in a ground - state condensate , where the kinetic energy of each particle is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is emphasized by the fact that @xmath50 , the latter which governs the internal binding energy of the exciton . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if the exchange term is not included in the bcs equations , then the exciton binding energy ( and @xmath46 ) remain constant until @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results provide a strong motivation to study the proposed material in the goal of achieving a strong , well defined , stable , condensed phase of excitons . </S>",
    "<S> unlike other proposed , or experimentally studied structures , here we present a condensate which is inherent to the structure , and constitutes its equilibrium ground state even at temperatures as high as 0.5 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the density of the condensate can be easily changed here by means of electric field . </S>",
    "<S> everything else being unchanged , the bec to bcs crossover can thus be readily studied . </S>",
    "<S> two previous works concerned excitonic phases in inas - gasb related structures . in @xcite experiments were done in semimetallic conditions under strong magnetic fields . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> single - exciton binding energies were calculated for different well widths . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations can not account for the condensate even at very low densities , where , as we have shown , many - body effects are of extreme importance . the effect of electric field on the condensate in these staggered - gap structures , and the externally induced phase transition , is recognized here for the first time .    </S>",
    "<S> delicate questions concern the problem of whether the exciton condensate is superfluid . as is well known , macroscopic condensation in the ground state is not sufficient for superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> degeneracy of the quantum mechanical phase is also necessary . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it was argued@xcite that the exciton condensate can not be superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments are based on the suppression of superfluidity by interband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> unanswered questions remain about the superfluid behavior in the limit when the matrix elements for those transitions are very small . </S>",
    "<S> experiments in @xmath0 exhibit macroscopic ballistic transport of excitons@xcite , which can be interpreted as the result of superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> lozovik and yudson@xcite , and shevchenko@xcite showed that if the electrons and holes are separated , the condensate can become superfluid ( in that case it actually becomes a double - layer capacitor - superconductor ) . </S>",
    "<S> shevchenko recently presented a phase diagram for that case@xcite . in the presently studied structure , </S>",
    "<S> electrons and holes are separated in type ( i ) structures . in type ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> structures the low - energy particles are of mixed type , and are spread across the double layer . </S>",
    "<S> based on existing knowledge , one expects to experimentally find different superfluid behavior between the two structures , and so base the ideas behind the suppression of superfluidity on firm grounds .    in conclusion , we presented a prototype system which we believe should exhibit a condensed phase of excitons . </S>",
    "<S> this phase results from an instability of the small - gap band structure , and is the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore expected to be robust to finite temperatures and imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the condensate , and of the underlying band structure , are easily controllable by virtue of applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we thus propose the material as a new platform for studying the condensed phase of excitons .    </S>",
