    "the telescope array ( ta ) is the largest cosmic ray experiment in the northern hemisphere .",
    "it was designed to help resolve physics differences between the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) @xcite , and the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "ta consists of three hires - like fluorescence telescope stations overlooking 507 agasa - like scintillator surface detectors ( see figures [ fig : slc_to_md ] and [ fig : ta_map ] ) .",
    "the surface detector ( sd ) array was deployed in a square grid with a 1.2 km separation , covering @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "each sd unit is composed of two layers of @xmath1 scintillating plastic sheets separated by a thin steel sheet .",
    "the light from each layer is collected by wavelength - shifting optical fibers and directed into separate photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) .         west of delta , utah .",
    "]    three telescope stations view the sky over the scintillator array .",
    "the northernmost fluorescence station , known as the middle drum site , consists of 14 telescopes refurbished from the hires experiment s hires-1 site .",
    "these were deployed between november , 2006 and october , 2007 and were arranged to view @xmath2 in azimuthal and @xmath3 in elevation .",
    "compared to hires-1 @xcite , the middle drum site has only @xmath4 of the azimuthal coverage but observes twice the elevation , as it was deployed into two rings , each covering @xmath5 in elevation .",
    "each telescope unit uses sample - and - hold electronics with a @xmath6 gate .",
    "each telescope camera consists of 256 pmts covered with an ultra - violet band - pass filter .",
    "descriptions of the black rock and long ridge telescope stations were described by tokuno @xcite .",
    "the goals of the middle drum spectral analysis are three - fold .",
    "the primary goal of this analysis is to determine the flux of particles using the same calibration and analysis processing tools used to produce the monocular spectrum from the hires-1 data .",
    "the second goal is to compare the spectra measured by the middle drum detector with that of hires-1 .",
    "since the telescope units used in both of these detectors are composed of the same equipment , the results of this comparison produce a direct link in the energy scale between these two experiments . finally , by comparing events observed by middle drum and any of the other ta detectors , the energy scale of the entire telescope array experiment",
    "can be compared to that of the hires experiment . in this paper",
    ", this comparison is performed between the geometries of the events observed by middle drum and reconstructed using the monocular technique to those events that triggered both middle drum and the sd array and analyzed using a hybrid technique .",
    "the middle drum data and monte carlo events ( described in section [ mc ] ) were processed using the same programs created for hires-1 analysis @xcite .",
    "the only changes made were for the location and pointing directions of the telescopes .",
    "the hires-1 analysis was unique in that there was limited elevation coverage and a traditional monocular reconstruction could not be performed on the data . instead , a combined geometrical - profile reconstruction was developed by abu - zayyad @xcite which increased the resolution of the observed showers .",
    "this technique was not required in the analysis of middle drum data since the detector observed longer - track events due to the increase in elevation angle coverage , however , it was used for consistency .    as at hires ,",
    "lasers are used for light - attenuation calibration , aerosol measurements , and relative - timing variances between the three fluorescence detector sites .",
    "most of the events observed by the middle drum detector belong to these calibration lasers which are primarily removed by only processing those events that are downward - tending , since the lasers are fired in either upward or horizontal directions .",
    "some of these laser shots appear to be downward - going events due to preliminary calculations using the timing and pointing directions of the triggered tubes .",
    "these are removed using the gps trigger time - stamp and the gps measured site positions .    after filtering out laser events ,",
    "most of those events that remain are due to electronic noise triggers , airplanes , and muons that pass through the camera s pmts .",
    "these are removed by determining a correlation between the time and geometrical pattern of the triggered tubes .",
    "triggered tubes are clustered into groups of three or more tubes with difference limits on the trigger - time of @xmath7 and the pointing - direction of @xmath8 from the previously triggered tube .",
    "these clusters are then combined into a single event - track from which a shower - detector plane ( sdp ) is determined .",
    "the tubes in a track are then iteratively checked and removed if greater than 3 rms deviations away in either time or angle from the mean @xcite .",
    "the middle drum data and monte carlo simulations are reconstructed in monocular mode with the geometry determined by the equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the respective trigger time and pointing direction of tube @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the impact parameter of the shower with respect to the detector , @xmath14 is the angle the axis of the shower makes with respect to the direction of the core impact position around the detector , and @xmath15 is the time the shower is calculated to be at @xmath13 .",
    "the profile of the shower is calculated using the gaisser - hillas parameterization @xcite @xmath16 ^{\\frac{x_{max } - x_{0}}{\\lambda } } e^{\\frac{x_{max } - x}{\\lambda } } ,    \\label{eq : gaisser - hillas_eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the number of charged particles ( measured from the signal strength ) at a given slant depth , @xmath18 , in @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the maximum number of secondary particles produced in the extensive air shower , located at @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is a fit parameter associated with the depth of the first interaction ; and @xmath23 is a fit paramater defining the width of the shower profile .    to reconstruct the middle drum data ,",
    "as was done for hires-1 , the time - fit was constrained by the shower profile reconstruction .",
    "this was performed by setting @xmath23 to a constant @xmath24 and @xmath22 to a constant @xmath25 in order to constrain the width and initial depth of the shower .",
    "these constants are in good agreement with average simulated shower measurements @xcite .",
    "an inverse - monte carlo reconstruction is then made by simulating showers that closely resemble the true event using the triggered tubes .",
    "this is performed by choosing a series of @xmath21 values for individual monte carlo events over all energies in the shower library . to determine a best - fit profile reconstruction",
    ", a comparison is made between the light signal actually observed to the one simulated for each tube considered in the reconstruction .",
    "this is effective since both the timing and the profile fits are only dependent on the trigger time and pointing directions of the tubes used in the reconstruction , which determine the slant depth of the shower that each tube is observing along the axis of the shower .",
    "separate chi - square minimizations are then performed on the timing and the profile reconstructions for each of the constant @xmath21 values chosen . the timing chi - square",
    "is calculated by @xmath26 \\right\\ } ^{2 }    \\label{eq : time_chi2}\\ ] ] with the error , @xmath27 , determined by the time to cross the face of a pmt .",
    "the profile chi - square is calculated by @xmath28 where , as in the timing fit , the sum is performed over the tubes within 3 rms deviations away from the shower - detector plane , the observed signal , @xmath29 , is also used to calculated the uncertainty , @xmath30 , which is estimated to be @xmath31 .",
    "the constant , @xmath32 , is obtained through adding in quadrature the sky noise and electronic fluctuations .",
    "details of the reconstruction codes can be found in the dissertation by abu - zayyad @xcite .",
    "the optimal reconstruction is then determined by calculating a best combined chi - squared for each @xmath21 fit using @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the normalized chi - square value calculated as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the chi - square of from the fit for each @xmath21 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the number of degrees of freedom and the chi - square , respectively , for the smallest chi - square reconstruction .",
    "as mentioned previously , this innovative technique was developed to reconstruct hires-1 data which had a limited elevation coverage .",
    "future analyses of middle drum data will include traditional monocular reconstruction techniques .",
    "however , this method was used in this current analysis to provide a direct comparison to the spectrum observed by hires-1 . additionally , this technique results in a better resolution and aperture than an unconstrained time fit , even for the longer tracks observed at the middle drum site .",
    "after the selection of candidate events is obtained , quality cuts are performed on the fully reconstructed showers to remove any event that exhibits anomalous behavior .",
    "these cuts were optimized for the the short shower tracks observed by hires-1 @xcite .",
    "the hires-1 analysis was ideal for cosmic rays with energy greater than @xmath39 since they could be observed from farther away and would appear as short tracks in the lower elevations .",
    "these cuts are applied to middle drum events since the higher - energy events would still have shorter tracks and the overlapping energy range between hires-1 and middle drum could then be directly compared .",
    "additionally , this gives a baseline to future analyses .",
    "events are retained if :    1 .",
    "the event reconstruct well , as determined by * not rejecting too many off - plane tubes , * there are enough slant - depth bins to fit a profile , * a @xmath40 minimum is attained , and * the modified geometry still parameterizes the timing fit ; 2 .   the angular tracks are @xmath41 , so that there are enough triggered tubes to provide a reliable reconstruction ; 3 .",
    "the shower depth into the atmosphere observed by the first tube used in the reconstruction is @xmath42 , so the fit is not focusing on the tail of the shower ; 4 .   the in - plane angle , @xmath14 , is @xmath43 , to make sure the detector is not overwhelmed with erenkov radiation ; and 5 .",
    "the area of the mirror observing the fitted track ( away from the mirror / tube edges ) is @xmath44 , to ensure there is not a bias in the reconstructed signal strength .",
    "the energy - dependent aperture of the detector is the product of the effective area and the solid angle of acceptance .",
    "this is calculated using the equations @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath13 is the distance of closest approach of the shower , @xmath47 is the zenith angle of the shower , @xmath48 is the number of events reconstructed with energy , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the number of events generated with energy @xmath51 . counting the number of events reconstructed at an energy folds in the detector bias into the energy spectrum calculation .",
    "alternatively , the detector efficiency at a certain energy can be calculated by replacing @xmath52 with the number of events retained with a certain generated energy , @xmath53 .",
    "the aperture of the middle drum detector has been calculated to be @xmath54 that of hires-1 for reconstructed energies of @xmath55 ev , falling linearly to 40% at @xmath56 ev ( see figure [ fig : tamd_hr1_aper ] ) .",
    "the corsika - simulated shower library used by middle drum was the same generated for hires , using qgsjet01 as the hadron interaction model @xcite .",
    "these showers were thrown with an isotropic distribution and consisted of @xmath57 the exposure of the middle drum collected data .",
    "the monte carlo simulated only proton events between @xmath58 ev and @xmath59 ev using values as measured by hires below the gzk cutoff @xcite @xcite .",
    "a spectral index of 3.25 was used below @xmath60 ev and 2.81 above .",
    "the spectral set was thrown without simulating the gzk suppression @xcite @xcite .",
    "the lower energy range was thrown out to a range of 25 km from the telescope site , well beyond where the detector is incapable of triggering on the fluorescence light of a @xmath60 ev cosmic ray shower .",
    "the higher energy range was thrown out to 50 km .",
    "the simulated showers of both energy regions were thrown with a maximum zenith angle of @xmath61 .",
    "the corsika output is fed into the detector monte caro resulting in events which look exactly like real data and are subjected to the same reconstruction programs and quality cuts .      to verify the adequacy of the monte carlo used for the aperture calculation and to confirm that the monte carlo closely models the real data",
    ", it is important to compare the distributions of the reconstructed monte carlo events and the data .",
    "these are shown in three energy ranges ( @xmath62 ev , @xmath63 ev , and @xmath64 ev ) in order to demonstrate that the monte carlo has the same energy evolution as the data .",
    "the variables chosen for this comparison are those that directly determine the aperture : the impact parameter , @xmath13 ( figure [ fig : dtmc_rp ] ) ; the shower zenith angle , @xmath47 ( figure [ fig : dtmc_zen ] ) ; and the shower azimuthal angle , @xmath65 ( figure [ fig : dtmc_azi ] ) .",
    "the impact parameter distribution directly determines the effective area of the aperture , and , as expected , the mean of the distribution increases along with the spread , or rms , as the energy increases .",
    "the zenith and azimuthal angles directly determine the solid angle of acceptance .",
    "for all three parameters , the ( black ) data points and ( red ) monte carlo histogram distributions are in excellent agreement .    it should also be noted that since the middle drum telescopes are pointing in the south - east direction , and that there is a quality cut removing many of those events that are pointing towards the detector , there is a depletion observed in the azimuthal distribution in this direction .",
    "this variance decreases with increasing energy since the impact parameter moves farther away from the detector and , therefore , there are fewer showers pointing above the @xmath66 limitation .    , in three energy ranges : @xmath62 ev , @xmath63 ev , and @xmath64 ev . the monte carlo ( red histogram ) is in excellent agreement with the data ( black points with error bars ) .",

    "the number of entries indicates the number of data events observed in that energy range .",
    "the mean of this distribution indicates that most events are pointing away from the detector . ]",
    "resolution plots indicate how well the detector simulation and reconstruction programs perform by comparing reconstructed values to generated values in monte carlo simulated events .",
    "the three primary parameters that show the quality of the reconstruction are the impact parameter ( @xmath13 ) and the in - plane angle ( @xmath14 ) obtained from the geometrical reconstruction , and the energy , obtained from the profile reconstruction .",
    "these are determined for the same three energy ranges as the data - monte carlo comparisons to show trends in the reconstruction . with increasing reconstructed energy ,",
    "the geometrical parameters show a trend of improving resolution ( see figures [ fig : res_rp ] and [ fig : res_psi ] ) . for all energy ranges ,",

    "the measured energy flux spectrum includes data collected using the middle drum fluorescence telescope station between december 16 , 2007 and december 16 , 2010 ( see figure [ fig : tamd_ontime ] ) .",
    "the spectrum only includes data collected on clear , moonless nights with minimal cloud cover in the view of the detector for reliable reconstruction .",
    "this amounts to @xmath67 site - hours of data collection , corresponding to a 9% duty cycle . multiplying this on - time with the aperture",
    "determines the middle drum exposure to be @xmath68 that of the final hires-1 exposure .        after three years of collecting data ,",
    "3859 events were observed . for each energy bin",
    "in which middle drum has observed events , the average number of events is @xmath69 that observed by hires-1 .",
    "this is consistent with the middle drum exposure calculation .",
    "as was mentioned previously , an inverse - monte carlo technique is used in order to determine the energy of the shower .",
    "the monte carlo shower library , parameterized by the gaisser - hillas equation ( see equation [ eq : gaisser - hillas_eq ] ) , is sampled for similar @xmath21 values and projected along the calculated geometry .",
    "the signal for each slant - depth bin of the simulated shower is then compared to the observed shower and chi - square values are calculated for a series of @xmath70 angles .",
    "the minimum chi - square value for a combined geometry and profile is determined to be the best - fit reconstruction .",
    "the showers are then distributed into tenth - decade energy bins from @xmath71 ev .",
    "the raw energy distribution for the data is shown in figure [ fig : tamd_nevents ] .",
    "ev and @xmath56 ev ]    the flux is calculated by combining the number of events and the exposure per energy bin using the equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of events in a given energy bin , @xmath74 ; @xmath75 is the width of the energy bin ; @xmath76 is the energy - dependent aperture calculated from equations [ eq : aper_zero ] and [ eq : aperture_calc ] ; and @xmath77 is the on - time of the detector .",
    "this flux is often multiplied by the cube of the energy to flatten the spectrum in order to more clearly show the subtle features of the flux of these particles .",
    "figure [ fig : tamd_spect ] shows the spectrum as determined from the middle drum data overlaid with that from the two hires detectors monocular reconstructions @xcite .",
    "these are in excellent agreement in both normalization and shape .",
    "a consistency between the spectra measured by the middle drum detector and the hires-1 detector is determined by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the measured flux and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the statistical uncertainties observed by the middle drum and hires-1 detectors , respectively ( see figure [ fig : tamd_hr1_diff ] ) .",
    "this calculation only included those energy bins with at least seven events observed by the middle drum telescopes within the hires-1 spectral range .",
    "this difference shows that the flux measured by middle drum is within @xmath83 of hires-1 .",
    "they are consistent with the same flux level .    .",
    "the spectrum as determined from the middle drum data is shown by the black boxes .",
    "the spectra of hires-1 ( upward , green triangles ) and hires-2 ( downward , magenta triangles ) are shown for comparison .",
    "the three spectra are in excellent agreement in both normalization and shape . ]     and @xmath84 ev were compared since these are the only bins in the middle drum data where there are more than seven observed events within the hires-1 energy range . ]    further , the middle drum spectrum can be quantitatively compared to the hires-1 spectrum by determining the @xmath40 between the flux measurements on a bin - by - bin basis .",
    "the @xmath40 value is calculated by summing over the square of each @xmath85 given in equation [ eq : tamd_hr1_diff ] .",
    "the result is a @xmath86 for all of the overlapping bins and @xmath87 for bins @xmath88 ev . figure [ fig : tamd_spect ] shows that the @xmath40 is dominated by the difference in the measured flux in the @xmath60 ev energy bin .",
    "since middle drum measured the spectrum with the same equipment and calibration techniques and obtained the same result as hires-1 , the hires-1 energy scale is thus transferred to middle drum . had the energy scale changed , the rapidly falling @xmath89 spectrum would have shifted by twice that increment .",
    "the transfer of the energy scale from the hires-1 spectrum to the middle drum spectrum creates a direct link between the hires and telescope array experiments . the next step to completely bridge the two experiments",
    "is to determine the energy scale between those events observed by the middle drum detector to those that also triggered the ground array .",
    "this middle drum monocular - hybrid comparison will then transfer the energy scale of hires to the rest of telescope array in future studies .",
    "the hybrid analysis begins by improving the geometrical reconstruction .",
    "time and pulse height information of the triggered ground array scintillator detectors ( sds ) are used to improve the time - versus - angle fit @xcite .",
    "this is performed by calculating the sd core using the modified linsley shower - shape @xcite to obtain a lateral distribution function ( ldf ) which is then used to constrain the monocular time - versus - angle fit performed for the fd .",
    "after the improved shower geometry is determined , the profile fit is performed using the inverse - monte carlo technique presented in this paper , however , in this fit , the geometry determined above was not adjusted to scan for a better profile fit .",
    "the hybrid data selection cuts use a combination of middle drum and sd information .",
    "events are retained if :    1 .",
    "the profile fit reconstructs well , as is determined in the monocular reconstruction ; 2 .",
    "the geometry fit has a @xmath90 ; 3 .",
    "the zenith angle is @xmath91 , providing a well - reconstructed sd core impact location of simulated showers thrown up to @xmath92 ; 4 .",
    "the sd calculated core must be within 500 meters of the sd boundary , so there is no bias in the ldf reconstruction ; 5 .",
    "the sd calculated core must be within 600 meters of the shower - detector plane , so the shower track remains consistent between the two detectors ; 6 .",
    "the angular track length is @xmath93 , to provide a reliable profile fit ; and 7 .",
    "@xmath21 is observed by middle drum , for reliable composition studies .",
    "since the boundary of the ground array begins @xmath94 km from the middle drum site , most of the monocular events with energy less than @xmath95 ev fall outside of the ground array ( see figures [ fig : tamd_hybrid_180 - 181 ] through [ fig : tamd_hybrid_183 - 184 ] ) . above this energy , roughly half of the events observed monocularly",
    "have core positions within the boundary of the ground array ( see figures [ fig : tamd_hybrid_184 - 185 ] and [ fig : tamd_hybrid_185 - 186 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pcgf_hybrid_energy ] shows a comparison of the energy for events reconstructed from the middle drum data in monocular mode to the same events reconstructed in middle drum - hybrid mode .",
    "only events retained in both the monocular and hybrid analyses were compared . for those events with @xmath96 ev ,",
    "the monocular and hybrid energies are in good agreement ( see figure [ fig : pcgf_hybrid_scale ] ) .",
    "this provides a direct link between the events observed by middle drum in monocular mode to those events that also trigger the ground array .",
