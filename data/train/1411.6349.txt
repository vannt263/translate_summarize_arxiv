    ", @xmath2 contains a closed geodesic of length @xmath11 .    in the 1980s , m. freedman considered the question of whether one can construct an embedded geodesic via min - max methods on the space @xmath3 .",
    "apart from being a fundamental question about closed geodesics , this question also has the following motivation . consider a similar problem for families of 2-dimensional spheres in a homotopy sphere @xmath12 .",
    "if we could replace a sweepout of @xmath12 by immersed 2-spheres with a sweepout by embedded 2-spheres , then by the ambient isotopy theorem it would follow that @xmath12 is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 , implying the poincar conjecture ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we give an affirmative answer to freedman s question .",
    "[ freedman ] every riemannian 2-sphere @xmath10 contains an embedded closed geodesic of length @xmath11 .",
    "a direct way of proving this result would be to start with an arbitrary sweepout , cut each curve in the family at the points of self - intersection , and then reglue them so that after a small perturbation we obtain a collection of embedded curves . cutting and regluing at finitely many points increases the energy by an arbitrarily small amount .",
    "if we could always obtain a sweepout by embedded curves this way then the min - max argument yields a sequence of embedded closed curves converging to a ( necessarily ) embedded closed geodesic .",
    "this cutting and regluing procedure can be done in many different ways .",
    "one may try to find a way so that the resulting collection of curves forms a continuous isotopy .",
    "in @xcite , freedman showed that such a direct approach fails .",
    "he constructs a family of curve with the property that , no matter how we choose to reglue the curves , the new family will contain a discontinuity . in this article",
    ", we circumvent this problem by first performing certain surgeries and , more importantly , by making use of the idea from @xcite of moving ` back and forth ' in time when constructing our homotopy out of regluings of curves . in general",
    ", the regluing procedure described above can produce many different simple curves from a given curve ; this latter idea avoids discontinuities in the resulting isotopy by allowing it to pass through different regluings of each curve .",
    "theorem [ freedman ] follows from a stronger result about simple sweepouts of @xmath10 .",
    "we say that a family of curves @xmath14 for @xmath15 $ ] is a _ simple sweepout _ of @xmath10 if every curve is either a constant curve , or is a simple curve .",
    "we prove the following theorem :    [ thm : simple_sweepout ] if there exists a sweepout @xmath16 of @xmath10 consisting of curves of length less than @xmath1 and energy less than @xmath17 , then there exists a simple sweepout of @xmath10 consisting of curves of length less than @xmath1 and energy less than @xmath17 .",
    "our construction of a simple sweepout consists of two steps .",
    "the first step is to modify our original sweepout @xmath18 so that it begins and ends at a constant curve .",
    "this is accomplished in section 3 by means of a certain surgery along a self - intersection point . in particular , we define a procedure that involves cutting some of the curves in @xmath18 at their self - intersection points and assembling the resulting subcurves into a new noncontractible family of curves that starts and ends at a constant curve .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : surgery ] .",
    "for a general family of curves such a surgery may not be possible ( see figure [ fig : replicating ] and the discussion at the end of 3.1 ) .",
    "we show , however , that it is possible whenever the family @xmath18 is noncontractible . to prove this result",
    ", we derive a certain formula ( proposition [ degree formula ] ) that relates the degree of the map @xmath18 to the number of times a small loop ( oriented appropriately ) is created or destroyed in this family .",
    "this formula is a consequence of whitney s theorem that the turning number of a curve on the plane does not change under regular homotopies .",
    "the second step is to remove the self - intersections of each curve in the family . to accomplish this , we apply theorem @xmath19 from @xcite .",
    "this theorem takes a homotopy between two simple closed curves @xmath20 and @xmath21 through curves of length ( energy ) less than @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) , and either constructs an isotopy between @xmath20 and @xmath21 or an isotopy between @xmath20 and @xmath22 through curves of length ( energy ) less than @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) . here , @xmath22 is @xmath21 with the opposite orientation .",
    "we give a brief description of this construction as we will need to use some of its properties in this article .",
    "consider a closed curve @xmath23 as a graph with vertices corresponding to self - intersection points and edges corresponding to arcs of the curve .",
    "a redrawing of @xmath23 is a connected closed curve obtained by traversing the edges of this graph exactly once in such a way that the result is simple after a small perturbation . in @xcite",
    "the authors showed that , given a homotopy @xmath18 , the space of all redrawings of all curves in @xmath18 is homeomorphic to a graph and that this graph contains a path that connects a redrawing of the initial curve to a redrawing of the final curve .",
    "we apply the same argument to our family of curves that starts and ends at a point . as a result",
    ", we obtain a family that starts and ends at a point and consists of simple closed curves . a priori",
    "this new family may be contractible in @xmath3 ; this indeed happens if the degree of the map @xmath18 is even . in section 4",
    "we prove that , if we start with a family of curves that corresponds to a map from torus to @xmath24 of odd degree , then this construction will produce a sweepout in which each curve in our modified family consists of arcs of some curve in the original family .",
    "our argument works in the same manner if we start from any family of closed curves which corresponds to a map from the torus to @xmath24 of odd degree .",
    "in particular , the methods above prove the following result , which partially answers a question of n. hingston and h .- b .",
