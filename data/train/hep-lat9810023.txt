    "the continuum fermion approach ( cfa ) to regularizing chiral fermions appears to be a promising method . for a summary of results obtained",
    "so far see  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the approach is the following .",
    "we start from a lattice with spacing @xmath0 .",
    "we call this the original lattice . on this lattice",
    "the simulations are done .",
    "next we construct a finer lattice with lattice spacing @xmath1 , using a suitable interpolation of the gauge field  @xcite . on this lattice",
    "we formulate the fermions .",
    "the action for a single fermion of chirality @xmath2 is taken to be @xmath3 where , restricting ourselves to gauge group u(1 ) , @xmath4 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\!\\!\\ !",
    "\\!\\!\\!&\\times \\;\\psi(n \\pm \\hat{\\mu } ) - \\psi(n)\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 being the link variable on the fine lattice , @xmath6 the fractional charge , and @xmath7 .",
    "the effective action is then computed from ( [ la ] ) in the limit @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is kept fixed .",
    "hence the name continuum fermions .",
    "a particular feature of this action  or better of the wilson term we have chosen  is that the wilson - dirac operator @xmath9 fulfills the ginsparg - wilson relation  @xcite : @xmath10 this is not a great surprise .",
    "the motivation behind our construction was to find an action which obeys the index theorem ",
    "what , in fact , it does as we shall see below .",
    "the ginsparg - wilson relation ( [ gw ] ) does , however , not guarantee that the theory is invariant under chiral gauge transformations .    indeed , the resulting effective action , @xmath11 , is not gauge invariant , even in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "but there exists a local , purely bosonic counterterm @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 is invariant under chiral gauge transformations . for the imaginary part",
    "this is only true in the anomaly - free model .",
    "the counterterm can be  and has been  computed in perturbation theory .    a further important feature of the action ( [ la ] )",
    "is that it has a shift symmetry which makes sure that the ungauged fermion with chirality @xmath14 decouples .    in the chiral schwinger model we found for the topologically trivial sector of the theory @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the effective actions of the corresponding vector model and the free theory , respectively .",
    "the imaginary part of the effective action turned out to be given by the harmonic part of the gauge field , i.e the toron field , alone , and it could be computed analytically from the gauge field we started with .",
    "thus we arrived at an action which can be simulated relatively easily on the original lattice .",
    "we believe to find a similar result in more realistic models in four dimensions .",
    "after so much of introduction , let us now come to our new results .",
    "our first results concern the chiral schwinger model . here",
    "we want to test whether the index theorem is fulfilled .",
    "this is a non - trivial task because any topologically non - trivial gauge field involves at least one singular plaquette .",
    "some authors have argued that the cfa would fail this test .",
    "this would be true had we employed the standard gauged or ungauged wilson terms . furthermore , we will investigate whether our approach reproduces the correct anomaly .    in two dimensions",
    "the index theorem says that in a background gauge field configuration of topological charge @xmath18 we should find exactly @xmath19 zero modes of chirality @xmath2 . for a configuration of ,",
    "e.g. , charge @xmath20 this would mean @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    to leading order in @xmath1",
    "the wilson - dirac operator can be written @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average of forward and backward derivatives .",
    "being a finite matix , the dirac operator @xmath25 has the same number of zero modes as the corresponding vector operator , namely @xmath26 , thus violating the index theorem .",
    "but the situation is different for the wilson term @xmath27 .",
    "it has @xmath28 zero modes of chirality @xmath2 and none of chirality @xmath14 , exactly as required by the index theorem . for small , but",
    "finite @xmath1 the zero modes approach the value @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the size of the original lattice .",
    "we consider two configurations of charge @xmath18 .",
    "we denote the link variables on the original lattice by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are the lattice points on the original lattice .",
    "the first configuration is  @xcite ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the second configuration is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse lattice laplacian .",
    "both configurations have constant field strength @xmath39 , zero toron field , and for @xmath40 they have one singular plaquette at @xmath41 .",
    "the two configurations are related by a periodic ( topologically trivial ) gauge transformation . in the following",
    "we shall take @xmath42 , and we shall use the interpolation given in  @xcite .",
    "both configurations give the same value for the effective action ( [ eff ] ) . as the anomaly - free model we took @xmath43 .",
    "this indicates that we have gauge invariance in the background of singular gauge fields as well .",
    "for @xmath44 we find exactly one zero mode with chirality @xmath45 , and none with chirality @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "we find two zero modes with chirality @xmath45 , and none with chirality @xmath46 . for negative charges we find the same result but with @xmath45 and @xmath46 interchanged , in agreement with the index theorem .",
    "the values of the zero modes are in good agreement with the analytical result ( [ zero ] ) .",
    "a further requirement of the method is that it reproduces the correct anomaly . in the chiral schwinger model",
    "the anomaly condition reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a gauge transformation .",
    "we consider configuration ( [ vm ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 now .",
    "the r.h.s . of ( [ anomaly ] ) is known analytically .",
    "the l.h.s .",
    "is computed for @xmath52 , i.e. on the @xmath53 lattice . in fig .",
    "1 we show the result for both sides separately for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as well as for the anomaly - free model .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our numerical results and the theoretical expectations ( i.e. the l.h.s . versus the r.h.s . ) .",
    "moreover , we see that the anomaly cancels in the anomaly - free model .",
    "we find similar results for configuration ( [ sv ] ) .",
    "our other new results are on the chiral u(1 ) model in four dimensions . this model is simpler than the chiral schwinger model because it has no topological charge and zero modes to worry about .",
    "the first question is again whether the theory exists at all , i.e. can be made finite by the addition of local counterterms .",
    "we find three possible counterterms : @xmath56 as before , the coefficients , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , can be computed in lattice perturbation theory .",
    "the result so far is @xmath59 we can not quote any number for @xmath58 yet .",
    "numerically we find that gauge invariance is , within our present accuracy , already restored by the counterterms @xmath60 and @xmath61 , if we use the perturbative values ( [ ct ] ) for the coefficients .",
    "this indicates that @xmath58 is very small , or zero . as an upper bound we can quote @xmath62 .",
    "what distinguishes the chiral theory from the corresponding vector theory is the imaginary part , @xmath63 , of the effective action . in two dimensions this",
    "was entirely determined by the toron field contribution . in four dimensions , however , we find that it is zero for toron field configurations .",
    "this leaves the interesting possibility that the imaginary part of the effective action is generally zero in this model .",
