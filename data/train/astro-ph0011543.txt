    "3c 120 is a broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) at @xmath10 exhibiting characteristics intermediate between those of fr i galaxies and bl lacs ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "it is also classified as a seyfert 1 ( burbidge 1967 ) , although its optical morphology is complex , see grandi et al .",
    "it is variable in all energy bands , and shows superluminal motion in the vlbi core ( e.g. , walker 1997 ) .    in 1994 ,",
    "3c 120 has been observed by _",
    "asca _ , and since then the strength and the width of its fe k@xmath5 has been a subject of a considerable controversy .",
    "reynolds ( 1997 ) found the line to be extremely strong , with an equivalent width of @xmath11 kev , as well as extremely broad , with a gaussian width of @xmath12 kev .",
    "the physical origin of such a line is unclear . a slightly weaker line , with @xmath13 kev and @xmath14 kev ,",
    "was found in the same data by grandi et al .",
    "both results were obtained assuming the underlying continuum was a single power law in the entire energy range observed by _ asca _ , and grandi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) mentioned the possibility that the unusual line parameters were caused by that assumption not being valid .",
    "indeed , woniak et al .  ( 1998 , hereafter w98 ) found that if the _ asca _ data ( with an updated calibration of 1997 ) were fitted in the 410 kev range assuming the presence of compton reflection with a reflector solid angle of @xmath15 between 0 and @xmath16 , the parameters of the line became much more physically plausible , with the best - fit values of @xmath17110 ev , the peak energy , @xmath18 kev , and @xmath19 kev and 0.20 kev assuming @xmath20 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the line in the _ asca _ data was again claimed to be very strong and broad by sambruna , eracleous & mushotzky ( 1999 ) , who obtained @xmath21 ev and @xmath22 kev , virtually identical with the values of grandi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "this issue has recently been resolved thanks to results of _ rxte _ and _ bepposax_. eracleous , sambruna & mushotzky ( 2000 , hereafter e00 ) have found the line in the _ rxte _ data ( @xmath23 kev ) to be weak with the parameters consistent with those of w98 , namely @xmath24 ev and @xmath25 kev .",
    "similarly , grandi ( 2000 , hereafter g00 ) have found @xmath26 ev and @xmath27 kev in a preliminary analysis of the _ bepposax _ data .",
    "since _ ginga _ did not observe 3c 120 , the actual strength of compton reflection had been unknown until the results of e00 and g00 , who found @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "these values of the solid angle are compatible ( george & fabian 1991 ; ycki & czerny 1994 ) with the presence of a modest fe k@xmath5 line with the parameters of w98 , e00 and g00 .    here ,",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the observation of 3c 120 by _ bepposax _ , which combines the broad - band hard x - ray coverage of _ rxte _ with a high energy resolution and an energy range in soft x - rays comparable to that of _ asca_. we address the issues of the parameters of the line and the continuum , their variability , radiative processes and geometry of the source , and the relationship of 3c 120 to other blrgs as well as seyferts .",
    "the observation log is given in table [ t : log ] .",
    "data from each instrument have been reduced following the standard procedures ( fiore , guainazzi & grandi 1999 , hereafter f99 ) .",
    "spectra of lecs and mecs ( 2 units ) detectors were extracted using a radius of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the background spectra were taken from the blank sky fields in the position of the source with the same extraction regions .",
    "lccccccc 1997 - 09 - 20 08:14:15 & 1997 - 09 - 22 16:22:34 & 34029 & 77758 & 35755 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 + [ t : log ]    we bin the lecs and mecs spectral files proportionally to the instrumental resolution ( f99 ) .",
    "after rebinning , there is always more than 20 counts per channel , as required for the validity of @xmath35 fitting .",
    "the lecs data are analyzed in the 0.34 kev energy range ( channels 2480 ) .",
    "the lower limit is above the standard value of 0.15 kev ( f99 ) because the source was strongly dominated by the background below 0.3 kev .",
    "the energy range of 1.310 kev ( channels 34114 ) is used for the mecs data .",
    "we allow a free normalization of the lecs spectrum with respect to the mecs one ( f99 ) .",
    "we use the variable rise - time pds spectrum .",
    "this choice is in agreement with f99 , who recommend this method for weak sources with count rates @xmath361 s@xmath37 and the statistical uncertainty of the photon index , @xmath7 , of @xmath38 , and with spectra similar to that of the crab .",
    "indeed , @xmath39 in the pds data , very similar to the crab spectrum , and the 13110 kev count rate is 0.72 s@xmath37 . after using the logarithmic rebinning in 18 channels ( f99 )",
    ", photons are detected up to channel 15 , and hereafter we use channels 215 .",
    "when the variable and fixed rise - time spectra are fitted by the same model , the normalization of the former is about 0.95 of the latter .",
    "the same value is obtained by directly dividing the two spectra in the 15100 kev energy range . if the lowest channels ( 1315 kev ) are also included , the ratio becomes slightly lower ( 0.93 ) . from this and",
    "recommendations of f99 , we derive the allowed relative normalization of the pds spectrum with respect to the mecs one of 0.770.85 .",
    "we use xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) for spectral fitting . the parameter uncertainties below correspond to 90% confidence for a single parameter , i.e. , @xmath40 , the plotted error bars are 1-@xmath41 , and the displayed spectral data are rebinned for clarity .",
    "the significance level of a hypothesis is obtained , unless stated otherwise , from the @xmath42-test . for calculations of luminosity , we assume @xmath43 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 , which gives the distance of 134 mpc .",
    "intrinsic model spectra are absorbed by the interstellar medium in the galaxy with a column density of @xmath44 @xmath45 ( elvis , lockman & wilkes 1989 ) .",
    "we also allow for intrinsic absorption at the redshift of the source with a column , @xmath46 .",
    "the absorption is in neutral matter with the abundances of anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) and the opacities of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "we allow for compton reflection of the primary continuum from an optically - thick medium .",
    "we use green s functions for angle - dependent reflection of isotropic incident radiation of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) .",
    "the inclination of 3c 120 is most likely close to face - on ( zenzus 1989 ) , and we thus use @xmath47 , which is the maximum value for which the green s functions are given .",
    "the relative amount of reflection is measured by the solid angle , @xmath15 , subtended by the reflector .",
    "the opacities of reflector are the same as for the absorber .",
    "we also test whether the reflecting medium can be ionized , in which case we use the one - zone ionization model of done et al.(1992 ) modified as in gondek et al .",
    "we assume then a reflector temperature of @xmath48 k ( krolik & kallman 1984 ) .",
    "the ionization parameter is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the luminosity in an incident power - law continuum in the 5 ev20 kev range , @xmath51 is the density , and @xmath52 the distance between the source of radiation and the reflector .",
    "reflection of the continuum is accompanied by emission of fluorescent lines , the most prominent of those is the fe k@xmath5 line . in models with static reflection ( as above ) , we model the line as a gaussian , in which we constrain the line width to @xmath53 kev ( so as to avoid this component to play a role of an additional continuum ) . the line equivalent width , @xmath54 , is proportional to @xmath15 at a given @xmath7 ( george & fabian 1991 ; ycki & czerny 1994 ) . in the case of an optically - thick accretion disk with a low ionization , cosmic abundances , an inclination of @xmath55 , and the photon index of @xmath561.9 ( which we find _ a posteriori _ to be the case for our data , see ",
    "[ s : results ] ) , calculations of george & fabian ( 1991 ) give approximately @xmath57 which condition we impose in our models . on the other hand",
    ", a remote molecular torus may be also present .",
    "it is likely that @xmath46 of the torus is substantially less than @xmath58 @xmath45 , as in most of seyfert 2s ( e.g.risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) and both narrow and broad line radio galaxies ( sambruna et al .",
    "1999 ) , as well as it is the case on average for seyfert 1s ( lubiski & zdziarski 2001 ) . in this case , reflection from the torus will be negligible ( e.g. , w98 ) but a a narrow fe k@xmath5 line at 6.4 kev will still be produced ( e.g. , makishima 1986 ) .",
    "thus , we allow the presence of a line with @xmath59 kev and @xmath60 kev and a free normalization in addition to that tied to the reflection .",
    "when the reflection comes from a fast rotating disk in a strong gravitational potential , doppler and gravitational shifts become important .",
    "we approximate these effects by convolving _ both _ the reflected component and the fe k@xmath5 line ( with @xmath59 kev and @xmath60 kev in the rest frame ) with the schwarzschild disk profile of fabian et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . in calculating the relativistic distortion",
    ", we consider a range of radii from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is in units of the gravitational radius , @xmath64 .",
    "we assume the emissivity of the reflection and the line to vary along the disk radius in the same way as the accretion disk emissivity , as expected when x - ray emitting regions above the disk derive their power from accretion . to properly describe the line in this detailed model",
    ", we also include the component of the fe k@xmath5 line singly - scattered in the disk at 6.2 kev containing 12% of the photons in the main component , as well as the fe k@xmath65 and ni k@xmath5 components , the sum of which we model as a single disk - line at 7.2 kev containing 18% of the photons in the main component ( see w98 ) . in those models , @xmath54 is defined for the fe k@xmath5 component only ( including the downscattered part ) , and it is tied to @xmath15 via equation ( [ eq : line ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is rather poorly fitted by a power - law continuum ( @xmath66 ) absorbed by @xmath67 , at @xmath68 .",
    "we have found that the bad fit is clearly caused by the presence of soft - excess , fe k@xmath5 , compton - reflection , and high - energy cutoff spectral features .",
    "we then fit an intrinsic continuum of an e - folded power law accompanied by static compton reflection and a gaussian line .",
    "this model provides a fair fit to the data , with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 kev , @xmath72 @xmath45 , at @xmath73 .",
    "however , there is a strong systematic residual feature at @xmath74 kev as well as the line width is at its allowed upper limit , @xmath75 kev , which is not physically consistent with the assumed static reflection . if we let the line flux to be independent of reflection , @xmath76 kev , but then @xmath54 is only @xmath77 of the value expected from the fitted reflection ( see discussion below on the absence of resonant absorption ) , as well as there is no improvement of @xmath35 .",
    "any possible contribution to the reprocessing features by the torus would only strengthen this discrepancy as a torus can produce a line without compton reflection ( see  [ s : models ] above ) .",
    "we find that allowing for an additional complexity of the spectrum in the soft x - ray range significantly improves the fit as well as makes the model more physically consistent .",
    "we first allow for a soft power - law component .",
    "this improves @xmath35 to 152.9/140 ( corresponding to 95% significance ) .",
    "the additional power law is quite soft , @xmath78 , and a rather large @xmath79 @xmath45 is required .",
    "then , we consider an incident e - folded broken power law .",
    "we indeed find a break energy at @xmath80 kev .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , we find that the best - fit model has a power law index , @xmath81 , below @xmath82 _ harder _ than that , @xmath83 , above @xmath82",
    ". the best - fit @xmath46 is 0 now , which explains the presence of the soft excess in the previous single power - law models with @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "the present model yields @xmath86 kev , @xmath87 , @xmath88 kev , null flux in the narrow line not associated with reflection , and @xmath89 ( the @xmath35 reduction is significant at 98% ) . however , as we discuss below , such a broken power law does not appear to correspond to a physical model .",
    "lccccccccc @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 & @xmath96 & @xmath97 & @xmath98 & 150.5/141 + [ t : fits ]    on the other hand , the soft excess apparent in the single power - law model can also be accounted for by an extended ( thus absorbed by @xmath67 only ) emission of a thermal , optically - thin , plasma ( e.g. , mewe , gronenschild & van den oord 1985 ) at @xmath99 kev . using this model for the soft excess yields @xmath100 , i.e. , an improvement of the fit at the 98% confidence level with respect to the model without a soft excess .",
    "the data and the model are shown in figure [ f : spectrum ] .",
    "the absorbed 0.22 kev luminosity in the extended emission is @xmath101 erg s@xmath102 , while its total unabsorbed luminosity is @xmath103 erg s@xmath102 , which is only 1.8% of the bolometric ( 0.1@xmath104 kev ) luminosity of @xmath105 erg s@xmath37 .",
    "a weak ( and probably constant ) soft x - ray excess in 3c 120 has also been found in _ exosat _",
    "observations by walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) , and in _ einstein _ data by turner et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .    with the model above",
    ", we find that @xmath20 yields @xmath106 , which corresponds to the probability of the absence of reflection of @xmath107 .",
    "the best - fit flux of the narrow line in our best - fit model with reflection is null .",
    "also , the best - fit parameters of the broad line remain virtually the same if we allow its flux to be independent of reflection .",
    "thus we hereafter consider only the line associated with compton reflection .",
    "the parameters of that model are given in table [ t : fits ] .",
    "note that @xmath54 and @xmath108 given there are not independent but instead related via eq .",
    "( [ eq : line ] ) , which also yield the line flux of @xmath109 @xmath45 s@xmath37 in this specific model . ( the corresponding @xmath7-@xmath15 error contour is shown in  [ s : comparison ] below . )    using this model except for allowing reflector to be ionized",
    ", we find the reflecting surface is close to neutral , with @xmath110 erg s@xmath37 cm , which implies that the dominant ion is fe xiii ( well below the region of resonant absorption ) .",
    "also , allowing the fe abundance to vary does not improve the fit and it has weak effect on its parameters ( cf .",
    "this confirms the validity of of equation ( [ eq : line ] ) . on the other hand , theoretical uncertainties on the fe k@xmath5 line flux from disk reflection ( ycki & czerny 1994 ) allow it to be within @xmath1111 of the values of george & fabian ( 1991 ) .",
    "if we use the lowest prediction on the disk line flux , the allowed narrow line is still rather weak , with @xmath112 ev .",
    "thus , given the limited statitics of our data , we can not rule out some contribution from a remote torus , either thomson - thin ( yielding only a narrow line as in the case above ) or thomson - thick ( yielding fractions of both the observed line and reflection ) .",
    "the gaussian fe k@xmath5 line shows evidence for a broadening and redshift ( see table [ t : fits ] ) .",
    "therefore , we also consider a model with the line emission and compton reflection [ tied via eq .",
    "( [ eq : line ] ) ] both originating in a relativistic disk (  [ s : models ] ) .",
    "we have found that this model provides as good a fit , with @xmath113 , as the one with a gaussian line and static reflection .",
    "its parameters are @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 kev , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 ev . with this physical model we re -",
    "examine the significance of the presence of the soft excess . without it ,",
    "the above model yields @xmath119 , which corresponds to the significance increased 99.5% .",
    "this shows that the physical requirement that both the line and the reflection continuum are broadened in the same way leads to an increase of the significance of the presence of a soft excess .",
    "then , we considered models with the continuum given by thermal comptonization ( including the soft plasma emission as in table [ t : fits ] ) .",
    "we use a model of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) , initially for spherical geometry with a homogeneous distribution of sources of seed photons , which we assumed to be a blackbody at a temperature of @xmath120 ev .",
    "we obtain a temperature of the scattering medium of @xmath121 kev , a thomson optical depth of @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "the fitted parameters weakly depend on the assumed geometry ; e.g. , a geometry with hot plasma regions in the form of cylinders on the surface of a disk yields @xmath126 kev , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 at @xmath130 .",
    "the latter geometry yields an anisotropy break appearing around the peak of the 2nd scattering order ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) , which could , possibly , account for the broken power - law spectral solution with the break at @xmath74 kev and no additional soft component described above .",
    "however , we have found that a coronal geometry without an additional soft component yields a relatively poor fit , @xmath131 with @xmath132 kev , @xmath133 . comparing to the thermal - compton above , the significance of the presence of a soft component is still 97% .",
    "if the temperature of seed photons is allowed to be free , @xmath134 ev , which constraint follows from the anisotropy break entering the fitted energy range .",
    "we also consider a model with a broken power - law primary continuum with a break at high energies .",
    "however , this model requires the break to be above our data , at @xmath135 kev , with the index below the break of @xmath136 and an unconstrained index above the break .",
    "this model also provides a relatively poor fit , with @xmath137 .",
    "thus , there is no evidence for a sharp spectral break at high energies in the data .",
    "the spectrum analyzed in  [ s : results ] has been integrated over the observation spanning more than 2 days ( see table [ t : log ] ) , during which the source varied .",
    "the lecs and mecs light curves are shown in figure [ f : var]a . in both instruments , the @xmath35 probability",
    "that the source were constant was @xmath138 independently of the temporal bin used .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed earlier on various time scales by _ exosat _ , _ rosat _ and _ asca _ ( maraschi et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter m91 ; grandi et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we see in figure [ f : var]a that the soft spectrum is more variable than the hard one .",
    "namely , the amplitude of the variations is @xmath139 in the 0.32 kev energy range and only @xmath140 in the 210 kev band .",
    "this variability pattern is driven by the spectrum becoming softer with increasing soft flux , as shown in figure [ f : var]b .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient between the hardness ratio and the soft count rate is @xmath141 , and the probability that the 2 quantities are correlated is @xmath142 .",
    "a similar anticorrelation of the x - ray flux and spectral index was found on longer time scales in _ einstein _ data by halpern ( 1985 ) and in _ exosat _ data by m91 and grandi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    in order to find the range of the spectral index , @xmath7 , corresponding to the anticorrelation shown in figure [ f : var]b",
    ", we have used the model of table [ t : fits ] in which we have varied ( only ) @xmath7 and then adjusted the normalization to match the 0.32 kev lecs rate of the extreme best - fit points in figure [ f : var]b .",
    "we have found that the range of @xmath7 matching the observed spectral variability is quite large , 1.702.03 ( significantly larger than the 90%-uncertainty range of the average @xmath7 in table [ t : fits ] ) .",
    "we have then investigated which physical process can be responsible for the observed behavior .",
    "a natural candidate here is thermal comptonization in a hot plasma cloud irradiated by a variable flux of soft seed photons , as suggested by m91 .",
    "if the power supplied to the cloud and its thomson optical depth , @xmath143 , are constant , its electron temperature , @xmath144 , will adjust itself to the variable seed flux as to satisfy energy balance .",
    "then , the higher the seed flux , the lower @xmath144 , and ( since a decrease of @xmath144 at a constant @xmath143 corresponds to an increase of the x - ray spectral index , @xmath7 ) the softer the x - ray spectrum .",
    "since the comptonized spectrum joins at low energies to the peak of the spectrum of the seed photons , this will also correspond to an increase of the soft x - ray flux .    to test",
    "whether this process can indeed reproduce the observed spectral variability , we have used a comptonization code by coppi ( 1992 , 1999 ) , with its present xspec version described in gierliski et al .",
    "this model is relatively similar to the one used in ",
    "[ s : results ] except for @xmath144 being calculated self - consistently ( rather than assumed ) from the fluxes in comptonized photons , @xmath145 , and in the seed photons irradiating the cloud , @xmath146 .",
    "thus , its main parameters are @xmath143 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , with @xmath146 giving the normalization of the spectrum .",
    "we assume that the plasma is purely thermal , and the seed photons are blackbody at @xmath147 ev .",
    "we then fit the time - averaged spectrum , and obtain the amplification factor of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "reflection is tied to the fe k line and the relativistic smearing is taken into account as in  [ s : results ] , yielding @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we also take into account the soft - excess emission of an optically thin plasma (  [ s : results ] ) , and obtain @xmath152 .",
    "we then vary _ only _ @xmath146 , increasing and decreasing it by a factor of 2 . unlike the power - law model above , we do not adjust the model normalization .",
    "the resulting predictions on the soft count rate and the spectral hardness are shown in figure [ f : var]b . given the simplicity of our assumption ,",
    "the agreement with the observed spectral variability is extremely good , yielding strong support to the picture of the x - ray variability driven by a variable flux of irradiating uv photons .",
    "the unabsorbed spectra corresponding to the inferred variability pattern are shown in figure [ f : spec_var ] .",
    "note that the shown uv and euv part corresponds only the blackbody photons irradiating the hot plasma , with photons emitted directly to the observer _ dominating _ actual uv spectra of 3c 120 ( see fig .  8 in m91 ) .",
    "we see that the average and the extreme spectra pivot in the @xmath15312 kev range .",
    "this is consistent with a lack of correlation of @xmath7 and the 210 kev flux found by walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) .    a result of walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) that @xmath7 is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the uv flux to the x - ray flux is then consistent with the variability pattern in figure [ f : spec_var ] , provided the uv flux incident on the hot plasma is proportional to that emitted towards the observer .",
    "this scenario is also supported by the finding of m91 that their highest uv state corresponds to the softest x - ray spectrum .",
    "note that walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) have suggested that the spectral variability in x - rays ( and the uv / x - ray correlation ) can be explained by thermal comptonization in a plasma with variable @xmath143 . for our obtained plasma parameters , we do not confirm this suggestion .",
    "namely , varying @xmath143 by a factor of 2 changes the soft count rate , but without any noticeable changes in the hardness ratio , in contrast to our successful model with variable @xmath146 .",
    "as we see in figure [ f : spec_var ] , a prediction of the thermal - compton model is that the lowest soft x - ray flux is associated with the highest flux in the @xmath15450 kev band as well as with the highest @xmath144 .",
    "unfortunately , the limited statistics of our pds data do not allow us to test this prediction .",
    "this can be tested in the future by the ibis detector aboard _ integral _",
    "( ubertini et al .  1999 ) .",
    "interestingly , the spectral variability of the black - hole binary cyg x-1 in the hard state does show a pattern similar to that in figure [ f : spec_var ] .",
    "namely , a relatively hard spectrum with @xmath155 has a high - energy cutoff corresponding to @xmath156 kev ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) whereas a relatively soft spectrum with @xmath157 has @xmath158 kev ( frontera et al .",
    "2001 ) and the 2 spectra intersect at @xmath159 kev ( see zdziarski , wen & paciesas 2001 ) .    in principle",
    ", the variability shown in figure [ f : var ] could also be a result of a variable @xmath46 .",
    "however , setting @xmath160 in our models of  [ s : results ] does not reproduce the highest count rate shown in figure [ f : var ] . for that",
    ", we have found that the intrinsic power law index would have to be @xmath161 . as already found in ",
    "[ s : results ] , such a @xmath7 gives a relatively bad fit to the average spectrum as well as it has not been observed by _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ ( see  [ s : comparison ] below ) .",
    "also , a model with variable @xmath46 has been considered by m91 , who ruled it out based on the extensive _ exosat _ monitoring . finally , that model would not explain the uv / x - ray correlation discussed above .",

    "we note first that a similar break appears in the _ rxte _ data ( see below ) , with the spectrum below 3.5 kev being significantly softer than that above it .",
    "however , this may result from calibration problems , as it is shown to be the case , e.g. , for a simultaneous _ asca_/_rxte _ observation of cyg x-1 ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) , and , accordingly , e00 have not taken into account the energy range below @xmath168 kev in their analysis .",
    "we have then looked at possible discrepancies between the _ asca _ sis and gis data .",
    "we have found that the sis data at @xmath169 kev and @xmath170 kev are somewhat harder and softer , respectively , than the gis data ( in both versions of the _ asca _ data of w98 and of sambruna et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , when we ignore the sis data above 5 kev and either sis or gis data below 1 kev , we obtain virtually identical parameters of the broken power - law fit , with only a slight change of the hard power law of @xmath171 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ( small ) discrepancy between the sis and gis data is _ not _ the cause of the 4-kev break , or , equivalently , of the spuriously strong and broad line appearing in fits with a single power law continuum .",
    "we also note that in the _ asca _ sample analyzed by w98 , a break at @xmath1724 kev appears also in the spectrum of 3c 382 and in one of 3 spectra of 3c 390.3 ( all observed in 199394 ) whereas is not seen in the spectra of 3c 445 , 3c 111 and the remaining two of 3c 390.3 ( from 199596 )",

    "we have refitted the _",

    "we find that the _ rxte _ data are compatible with the presence of an additional line component in addition to that coming from the reflector ( see   [ s : results ] ) .",
    "we obtain then continuum parameters similar to those of e00 , namely @xmath173 , @xmath174 , yielding @xmath175 .",
    "the equivalent widths of the reflection - related line and the additional line are @xmath176 ev and @xmath177 ev , respectively .",
    "the data prefer the reflection - related line to be narrow , with @xmath178 kev . in spite of these differences , the line parameters in the _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ data are still consistent with each other within 90% confidence .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath15 error contours for the _ rxte _ data and those from _ bepposax _",
    "( using the model of table [ t : fits ] ) are shown in figure [ f : reflection ] .",
    "we also note hard tails in the pca and hexte data above the energy ranges used by us .",
    "the presence of these tails , most likely due to residual inaccuracies in background subtraction , appear responsible for the very high e - folding energy ( @xmath179 kev ) and for the relatively large @xmath180 obtained by e00 .",
    "when the data containing the tails are not used , @xmath181 is unconstrained by the _ rxte _",
    "data , and we thus kept it fixed at 150 kev ( obtained from the _ bepposax _ data ) .",
    "thus , there is an overall agreement about the parameters of both the line and the hard x - ray continuum between the _ bepposax _ , _ asca _ and _ rxte _ data : @xmath1820.3 kev , @xmath183100 ev , @xmath1841.9 , @xmath1850.6 .",
    "a somewhat unclear issue is the form of the break or cutoff at soft @xmath186-rays .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "data do not allow us to determine it , as discussed above .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "data require a high - energy break or a cutoff . in the e - folded power - law model , shown in figure [ f : comparison ] , @xmath187 kev .",
    "also , an osse observation simultaneous with that by _ asca _ required the presence of a cutoff with @xmath188 kev at a significance of 99.95% ( w98 ) .",
    "however , we see that the average osse data shown in figure [ f : comparison ] above @xmath189 kev clearly lie above the predictions of this model for energies @xmath190 kev .",
    "this remains the case when the osse data ( at a free normalization ) are fitted together with the _ bepposax _ data , in which case the best - fit values are @xmath191 kev ( @xmath192 ) and @xmath193 kev in the e - folded power - law model and the spherical thermal - compton model , respectively .",
    "since the osse data show the source variability at energies @xmath194 kev ( w98 ) , it is possible that the cutoff energy is variable , and the spectrum at the time of the _ bepposax _ observation did have an exponential cutoff . on the other hand , the spectrum of 3c 120 might have a substantial high - energy tail due to a non - thermal continuum .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by osse observations of other radio galaxies , as discussed in w98 .",
    "in particular , the osse data might contain a contribution from non - thermal , doppler - enhanced , radiation of a jet . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we again fit the combined _",
    "bepposax_/osse data ( as above ) with the model of table [ t : fits ] but with an addition of a power law representing the jet emission .",
    "this yields yields @xmath195 ( which corresponds to the significance of adding the power - law component of only 75% ) and the best - fit @xmath196 ( which is almost unconstrained due to the low significance of adding that component ; other best - fit parameters are @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 kev )",
    ". the 1-kev normalization of the jet component is @xmath200 @xmath45 s@xmath37 kev@xmath37 when @xmath201 is fixed at 1.7 .",

    "cgro_/egret detection threshold .",
    "even though pointed several times , egret has not detected 3c 120 ( lin et al .",
    "thus , if such a power - law jet component exists , it has to be either very weak or have a strong break / cutoff at energies below those observed by egret . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no statistically significant evidence for its existence in the data .",
    "w98 have pointed out that blrgs appear , on average , to have less compton reflection , weaker f k@xmath5 lines and harder x - ray spectra than radio - quiet seyfert 1s .",
    "those conclusions have been confirmed by the studies of the _ bepposax _ and _ rxte _ data ( g00 , e00 ) . in particular , the mean of the best - fit values of @xmath7 and the standard error of measuring that mean in models with compton reflection in the above blrg samples from _ ginga _ ( w98 ) , _ bepposax _ ( g00 ) , and _ rxte _ ( e00 ) are @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively . for the sum of the 3 samples ,",
    "we obtain @xmath207 .",
    "all these values are less than the corresponding mean for seyfert 1s , which for the sample from _ ginga _ ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) and _ bepposax _ ( matt 2000 ) is @xmath208 and @xmath209 , respectively .",
    "( in both cases , ngc 4151 , a seyfert 1 with very strong x - ray absorption , has not been included for computing the mean . )",
    "these numbers clearly show that @xmath210 in blrgs is significantly lower ( by @xmath211 ) than that in seyfert 1s .",
    "the probability that the mean of the above joint sample of blrgs equals 1.95 ( i.e. , the mean of seyfert 1s of nandra & pounds 1994 ) is @xmath212 ( obtained from the student @xmath213 distribution ) . also , we note that _ all _ 15 best - fit values of @xmath7 in the above 3 samples of blrgs are less than @xmath214 of nandra & pounds ( 1994 ) . if @xmath7s of blrgs were sampled from the same distribution as that of seyfert 1s , the probability of such an event would be only @xmath215 .",
    "furthermore , we can test the hypothesis that the joint sample of blrgs has the mean of 1.95 _ and _ the standard deviation of 0.15 ( as in the sample of nandra & pounds 1994 ) , for which we obtain the probability of @xmath216 ( based on the normal distribution ) .",
    "we note that e00 stated that their distribution of @xmath7 did not differ from that of seyfert 1s from _",
    "ginga_. however , the probability that their values of @xmath7 ( 1.78 , 1.90 , 1.72 , 1.92 ) belong to the distribution with @xmath217 and @xmath218 is only 5% .",
    "furthermore , we should note the difference of @xmath219 between _ rxte _ and other x - ray instruments in fits to the crab as well as other sources ( e.g. , gierliski et al .  1999 ; done , madejski & ycki 2000 ) , which , if taken into account , would make the difference in @xmath214 between blrgs and seyfert 1s even more pronounced , reducing the above probability to @xmath220 .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of @xmath7 in blrgs is _ not disjoint _ from that in seyfert 1s .",
    "this can be noted by considering the intrinsic dispersion , @xmath221 , of the values of @xmath7 in the samples ( given by their standard deviations ) . for the blrgs samples from",
    "_ ginga _ , _ bepposax _ and _ rxte _ , @xmath222 , 0.08 , and 0.10 , respectively , while @xmath221 of their sum equals 0.14 .",
    "the dispersion in the seyfert-1 samples from _ ginga _ and _ bepposax _ ( nandra & pounds 1994 ; matt 2000 ) is @xmath223 and 0.20 , respectively .",
    "given the values of @xmath224 listed above , the distributions for blrgs and seyfert 1s significantly overlap ( which , we stress again , does not imply that the 2 distributions are indistinguishable ) .",
    "furthermore , blrgs obey an overall correlation between these @xmath7 and @xmath15 seen in seyferts ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 , hereafter z99 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ f : reflection ] ( where we can also note the @xmath225 offset between the _ rxte _ results and those of _",
    "ginga _ and _ bepposax _ ) .",
    "we see that blrgs ( including 3c 120 ) simply occupy a lower left part of the broader @xmath7-@xmath15 parameter space occupied by radio - quiet seyferts . also , the average strength of the broad component of the fe k@xmath5 line in radio - quiet seyferts with @xmath7 close to that of 3c 120 observed by _ asca _",
    "( lubiski & zdziarski 2001 ) corresponds to the strength of compton reflection consistent within error bars with that observed in 3c 120 .",
    "this implies a general similarity between the physical conditions in the x - ray sources of seyferts and blrgs ( including 3c 120 ) , but with some unknown parameter determining ( @xmath7 , @xmath15 ) in blrgs offset with respect to that in radio - quiet seyferts .",
    "we discuss this issue in the  [ s : geometry ] below .    the overall similarity between the x - ray properties of blrgs and radio - quiet seyferts is further confirmed by the variability pattern of 3c 120 ( fig.[f : var]b ) , where the x - ray spectrum becomes softer with the increasing x - ray flux .",
    "this pattern is the same as that often seen in radio - quiet seyfert 1s , e.g. , in ngc 5548 ( magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ) and ngc 4151 ( yaqoob & warwick 1991 ) .",
    "we also note that black - hole binaries in the hard state show a similar behavior ( e.g. , zdziarski , wen & paciesas 2001 ) .",
    "clearly , the dominant radiative process responsible for x - ray continua of many classes of compact objects is compton upscattering of soft photons by energetic electrons .",
    "less clear issues are the form of the electron distribution and the source of the seed soft photons . in the case of radio - quiet seyfert 1s , the form of the soft @xmath186-ray spectra from osse rules out distributions dominated by non - thermal electrons ( gondek et al .",
    "the strongest evidence for an electron distribution close to maxwellian with @xmath2100 kev and @xmath226 in seyferts comes from the average osse spectrum of ngc 4151 ( johnson et al .",
    "1997 ) and the combined average osse spectra of other seyferts ( zdziarski , poutanen & johnson 2000 ) .    in the case of 3c 120 ( as well as other blrgs , w98 ) ,",
    "there is a break or a cutoff in soft @xmath186-rays , but its form is not well determined .",
    "the thermal - compton model gives @xmath227130 kev , but the osse data above 100 kev lie somewhat above the predictions of this model , indicating a possible high - energy , non - thermal , tail .    on the other hand , the fact that the x - ray spectra of blrgs obey the @xmath15-@xmath7 correlation supports their predominantly thermal origin .",
    "as discussed in z99 , the most likely origin of the correlation is a feedback between cold and hot media .",
    "the cold medium compton reflects hard emission and provides blackbody seed photons for thermal - compton cooling of the hot , x - ray emitting , plasma .",
    "( if the electrons in the hot plasma were predominantly non - thermal , no relation of the x - ray slope to the rate of cooling would be required . ) furthermore , the observed softening of the x - ray spectrum with increasing flux ( figs .",
    "[ f : var]-[f : spec_var ] ) strongly supports the thermal - compton model with a variable flux of irradiating soft photons , as shown in ",
    "[ s : var ] .",
    "as stated above , the presence of the @xmath15-@xmath7 correlation implies that the seed photons comptonized in the hot plasma are emitted by a surrounding cold medium rather than intrinsically to the hot plasma .",
    "this is independently supported by results of wardziski & zdziarski ( 2000 , see their fig .  8) , who found that the expected strength of magnetic field in accreting sources in luminous agns ( such as 3c 120 ) is far too weak to provide enough seed photons via thermal synchrotron emission for comptonization to account for the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "the best - fit thermal - compton models (  [ s : results ] ) have @xmath144 ( @xmath22850 kev ) too low for the plasma clouds with @xmath229 and sizes @xmath230 to be made predominantly of @xmath231  pairs , as follows from consideration of equilibrium between pair production and annihilation ( stern et al .  1995 ; svensson 1996 ) .",
    "pair - dominated plasmas are only marginally possible for the highest @xmath144/lowest @xmath143 compatible with the data at 90% confidence , @xmath232 kev , @xmath233 , provided the active regions are small enough ( svensson 1996 ) . on the other hand",
    ", a modest non - thermal tail in the electron distribution could greatly enhance the pair - production rate , easing the above constraint .",
    "thus , our data do not significantly constrain the pair content in the x - ray emitting plasma in 3c 120 .",
    "we note that even if the plasma is pair - dominated , the presence of a distinct @xmath231  annihilation feature around 511 kev is unlikely ( macioek - niedwiecki , zdziarski & coppi 1995 ) .",
    "to conclusively resolve the issue of the presence of pairs , high signal - to - noise data up to @xmath74 mev ( e.g. , from the ibis/_integral _ detector ) are required .",
    "two main disk geometries have been invoked for accreting x - ray sources : a patchy corona above a cold accretion disk , and a hot accretion disk with an overlapping cold medium ( either an outer cold disk , cold blobs or both ) .",
    "as we show below , both of those possibilities appear viable for 3c 120 , and blrgs in general .    in the case of coronal geometry ,",
    "the values of @xmath144 and @xmath7 fitted to the _ bepposax _ spectrum of 3c 120 (  [ s : results ] ) strongly rule out either a homogeneous corona or active regions located directly on the disk surface , from considerations of energy and pair balance ( stern et al .",
    "on the other hand , models with static active regions elevated above the disk to a height comparable to their size can fit 3c 120 , see svensson ( 1996 ) . in this geometry ,",
    "the fitted @xmath234 can be explained by a partial obscuration of the reflecting disk surface by the active regions .",
    "however , in order to produce harder spectra , like those of other blrgs , the emitting region should be even more separated from the cold accretion disk ( e.g. , svensson 1996 ) , but in that case the predicted @xmath235 and @xmath15 would increase with decreasing @xmath7 , _ opposite _ to the observed @xmath7-@xmath15 correlation ( fig .",
    "[ f : reflection ] ) .",
    "this problem can be solved by mildly relativistic motion of emitting plasma away from the disk , in which case both hard spectra and little reflection are obtained ( beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "the dashed curve in figure [ f : reflection ] shows a specific version of this model , as computed in z99 .",
    "we see that it can approximately reproduce the values of @xmath7 and @xmath15 of blrgs .",
    "this model has been claimed to be untenable for blrgs by e00 on the grounds that radio jets in blrgs are highly relativistic , with @xmath236 .",
    "however , radio jets ( in particular the relativistic jet in 3c 120 , walker 1997 ) are observed on scales much larger than @xmath237100 inferred from the observed fe k@xmath5 line broadening .",
    "the process of jet formation remains not well understood , but it is quite likely that the matter in the jet originates in an accretion disk . in that case , there has to be an inner region with a mildly relativistic wind velocity before @xmath236 is reached . that inner region may be then responsible for the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the main alternative model involves a hot accretion disk ( shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) .",
    "advection in the flow results in a branch with ineffective cooling as well as it limits the possible maximum luminosity and the optical depth of an inner flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "the strength of reflection depends on the amount of overlap of the hot disk with an outer cold disk .",
    "the less overlap , the less effective cooling by blackbody photons emitted by the cold disk and the harder the x - ray spectrum . results of a simple calculation of this effect by z99 are shown by the solid curve in figure [ f : reflection ] .",
    "we see that this model is also roughly capable of explaining the data for 3c 120 and most other blrgs . in the case of 3c 120 ,",
    "the overlap is required by the relatively large fitted value of @xmath15 since a sharp radial transition between the hot and cold phases yields @xmath238 ( see z99 ) .",
    "both models explain the anticorrelation between the soft x - ray flux and the spectral hardness as being due to the increased cooling of the hot plasma by emission of the cold disk . in the hot accretion disk model ,",
    "this can naturally be associated with the cold disk moving inward . in the outflow model ,",
    "an increased soft flux can be directly due to an increase of the accretion rate .",
    "the fact that blrgs have harder spectra with less reflection than those average for seyfert 1s indicates that some physical parameter ( presumably the same that leads to the strong radio emission and jet formation in blrgs ) leads ( on average ) either to stronger coronal outflows ( in the disk - corona model ) or to larger inner radii of the cold disk ( in the hot / cold disk model ) than in the case of radio - quiet seyferts .      in  [ s : results ] ,",
    "we have compared 3 pairs of models with and without an additional soft component . in the case of static reflection and a gaussian line , the fit improvement due to adding emission of an optically - thin thermal plasma has 98% significance .",
    "however , the model without that component has a line with a large width incompatible with the assumed static reflection .",
    "when both the line and reflection are relativistically smeared , this significance increases to 99.5% . finally , this significance for coronal comptonization regions ( which soft x - ray spectrum differs from a power law ) is 97% . using the last model , we have also demonstrated that the broken - power law fit in ",
    "[ s : results ] can not be physically justified as an approximation to the comptonization anisotropy break .",
    "thus , combining our spectral analysis with physical constraints we find the presence of a soft x - ray excess in the data to be confirmed at a high significance .",
    "the optically - thin emission is likely to come from a larger , kpc - scale , region .",
    "extended thermal components are commonly detected in soft x - rays from 3c radio galaxies , especially of the fr i type ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) .",
    "a recent analysis of _ rosat _ data has shown the presence of a hot gaseous environment in the blrg 3c 382 ( prieto 2000 ) , which x - ray spectrum is rather similar to that of 3c 120 ( w98 , g00 ) .",
    "in fact , a re - analysis of the _ rosat_/hri image of 3c 120 ( d. harris , private communication ) appears to show an extended halo , with the 0.22 kev luminosity emitted beyond the core radius of @xmath239 ( 6.5 kpc ) comparable to that emitted by the optically - thin plasma in our spectral model (  [ s : results ] ) .",
    "this result strongly supports the actual presence of the soft excess in 3c 120 ( also found in _",
    "data by walter & courvoisier 1992 ) .",
    "alternatively , the optically - thin emission can come from an intercloud medium within the broad - line region .",
    "the emission measure obtained by us is , in fact , consistent with the typical intercloud density ( @xmath240 @xmath241 ) and the size of the broad - line region in 3c 120 of @xmath242 light - days , inferred from reverberation techniques ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "a somewhat worse fit was obtained with an additional steep power law , which could represent emission from a soft x - ray jet .",
    "however , the only resolved feature away ( @xmath243 ) from the nucleus in the _ rosat_/hri image of 3c 120 ( harris et al .  1999 ) emits a negligible soft x - ray luminosity , @xmath244 of the total x - ray/@xmath186-ray luminosity , which makes this model relatively unlikely .",
    "also , the soft power law fitted by us could also represent a high - energy extension of the uv bump present in 3c120 ( m91 ) .",
    "this , however , requires rather high temperatures of the uv emitting medium , which could , in principle , be achieved in a transition layer between the disk and the corona ( e.g. , czerny & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "this ( together with the observed variability pattern ,  [ s : var ] ) would require the soft x - ray excess to vary together with the main x - ray component , which may be in conflict with results of walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the pattern of spectral variability shown in figure [ f : spec_var ] shows a variable power law index .",
    "the resulting average spectrum will be concave as the softest and hardest power law will dominate in the lowest and highest energies , respectively",
    ". this concave spectrum can , in principle , be responsible for the fitted soft excess .",
    "thus , we can not conclusively determine the nature of the soft component due to the limited x - ray imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of _ bepposax_. to achieve this goal , observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ are highly desirable .",
    "our _ bepposax _ data clearly show a continuum due to reflection of an x - ray power law with @xmath2451.9 from a cold material .",
    "the significance of the presence of reflection is @xmath246 and the solid angle of the reflector is @xmath247 ( @xmath248 for the e - folded power - law incident continuum ) . the reflection is accompanied by a fluorescent fe k@xmath5 line with an equivalent width ( @xmath249 ev ) fully consistent with originating entirely from the reflector .",
    "the line is moderately broad , and combining our spectral constraints with those from _",
    "asca _ and _ rxte _ ( which data show an overall agreement with those of _ bepposax _ ) yields @xmath2500.3 kev .",
    "if this line comes from a keplerian disk in a schwarzschild metric , the inner radius of the emitting region is @xmath251 .",
    "we find the presence of a high - energy break or cutoff in the _ bepposax _ data .",
    "we can fit the data by either an e - folded power law or thermal comptonization , obtaining @xmath252 kev , @xmath253130 kev , respectively . in the latter model ,",
    "we also detect a relatively weak ( but significant at a @xmath255 confidence ) soft excess .",
    "it is best - fitted by emission from an extended thermal plasma at @xmath256 kev , which model is supported by an independent finding of an extended soft x - ray halo from 3c 120 .    we find strong spectral variability during the 2-day observation , corresponding to @xmath7 varying from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and correlated with the soft x - ray flux .",
    "the variability is very well modeled by thermal comptonization in a hot plasma with a constant @xmath143 which temperature adjusts to a variable flux of irradiating uv photons .",
    "the 3c 120 data obey the general correlation between the power - law slope and the strength of compton reflection found in seyferts and black - hole binaries .",
    "interpretation of this correlation involves feedback between a thermal comptonizing plasma and a cold medium , yielding support for our thermal - compton spectral model .",
    "our data are consistent with two geometries : an outflow above the surface of a disk , or a hot inner disk surrounded by an overlapping cold disk .",
    "both homogeneous and static patchy corona models can be ruled out .",
    "we confirm ( at a very high confidence level ) that blrgs have harder x - ray spectra , less compton reflection and weaker fe k@xmath5 lines than those average in radio - quiet seyferts .",

    "<S> we study a broad - band x - ray observation by _ bepposax _ of the broad - line radio galaxy 3c 120 . </S>",
    "<S> the primary x - ray continuum is well described by a power law with the photon index of @xmath0 and a high - energy break or a cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained e - folding energy of @xmath1300 kev corresponds to @xmath2 kev in thermal - compton models . </S>",
    "<S> a soft x - ray excess is found at a statistical significance of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our physical best - fit model of the excess is optically - thin emission from an extended plasma ( with a luminosity of @xmath4 of the total x - ray luminosity ) , which interpretation is supported by an independent finding of an extended soft x - ray halo in 3c 120 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a moderate compton reflection component together with a moderately broad fe k@xmath5 line with an equivalent width ( @xmath6 ev ) fully consistent with the strength of reflection , indicating their origin in an optically - thick accretion disk extending relatively close to the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we observe strong spectral variability during our 2-day observation with @xmath7 varying from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and correlated with the soft x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> the variability is very well modeled by thermal comptonization in a hot plasma irradiated by a variable uv flux . </S>",
    "<S> both a hot patchy corona outflowing with a mildly relativistic velocity away from a cold disk and a hot inner accretion flow overlapping with the cold disk are viable geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an outflow in the first case and an overlap between the hot and cold phases in the second case are required by energy balance and the observed strength of compton reflection . </S>"
