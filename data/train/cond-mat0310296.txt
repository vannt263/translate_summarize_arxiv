    "a simple liquid can not sustain shear stress under a static condition .",
    "however , at molecular length and time scales ( i.e. time scales of the order of the relaxation time of the liquid ) , it is known that a liquid behaves much like a solid with a viscoelastic character @xcite .",
    "one can understand such a phenomenon qualitatively as follows . on molecular length",
    "scales a dense liquid develops solid - like structures due to slowing down of diffusional structural relaxation and consequently it can support a shear wave .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of hard sphere liquids and experiments on liquid argon support this picture @xcite . on the theoretical end ,",
    "such a behavior can be understood in terms of viscoelastic models@xcite .    in recent years",
    "there have been experiments probing ` brownian motion ' of polysterene spheres in bacterial baths @xcite .",
    "these experiments point to a crossover from superdiffusive to diffusive behavior of the mean - square displacement of the polysterene beads suspended in a bacterial bath .",
    "this effect is similar to ballistic to diffusive transition in colloids @xcite where the borderline for such a transition is given by the viscous damping time @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the mass of the brownian particle and @xmath2 the friction coefficient ) , which for a polysterene bead of diameter @xmath3 is about @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the case of a bacterial bath one notices that such a transition takes place at a time of about @xmath5 .",
    "this characteristic time scale @xmath6 increases with the number density @xmath7 of bacterial cells in the bath .",
    "the length scale @xmath8}$ ] , which is the root mean square displacement at @xmath9 also increases with @xmath7 .",
    "these observations point to the formation of correlated structures in the form of bacterial swirls which have been observed in these systems .",
    "in fact , one finds that @xmath10 is indeed of the order of the spatial scales of these swirls ( @xmath11 ) . to sum up ,",
    "one of the key observations coming out of these experimental studies is the emergence of a time scale and a corresponding length scale in the brownian motion of a polysterene bead suspended in a bacterial bath .",
    "this time scale @xmath6 increases with the number density @xmath7 of the bacterial bath , indicating the appearance of solid - like ordering over length scales around @xmath8}$ ] . in a dense liquid",
    "such ordering takes place on molecular length scales . in the present experiments the bacterial bath can be viewed as a scaled up liquid with a typical relaxation time scale @xmath12 in contrast to a colloidal liquid characterized by a time scale @xmath13",
    "we now describe in some more quantitative detail the crossover from super - diffusive to diffusive behavior in a bacterial bath .",
    "consider the dynamics of a bead of mass @xmath1 suspended in a bacterial bath @xcite in terms of a phenomenological langevin - type equation : @xmath14 where @xmath2 @xcite is the friction coefficient of the fluid .",
    "the collisional force @xmath15 experienced by the bead due to  kicks \" from the swirls of bacteria has a zero mean and is exponentially correlated in time with a time scale @xmath6 corresponding to the lifetime of a swirl .",
    "thus @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 the einstein diffusion coefficient .",
    "such an analysis leads to the following behavior for the mean square displacement of the bead . at short times ( @xmath19 )",
    "the motion of the bead is ballisticlike with @xmath20 whereas at long times ( @xmath21 ) it is diffusive @xmath22@xcite .",
    "more recent experiments on correlated bacterial motion@xcite also indicate the emergence of a long time scale @xmath6 increasing with the number density @xmath7 of bacteria . one interesting observation that comes out of the study",
    "@xcite is an enhancement of the viscosity @xmath23 of the bacterial bath .",
    "this enhanced viscosity is proportional to the large time scale @xmath6 emerging in the problem . in this paper",
    "we show that this _ crossover time scale @xmath6 _ is connected to a _ viscous to an elastic transition in a bacterial bath . _ which is of the order of the lifetime of a swirl .",
    "] let us consider the following model which interpolates between a purely viscous response and a purely elastic one for a liquid of viscosity @xmath23 and high frequency rigidity modulus @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 here @xmath26 is the @xmath27 component of the shearing stress tensor corresponding to the strain rate @xmath28 . on taking the fourier - laplace transform of eq.([vis ] ) one notices that the viscoelastic approximation corresponds to replacing the zero frequency shear viscosity @xmath23 by a frequency dependent shear viscosity : @xmath29 defining @xmath30 to be the relaxation time , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ vislap ] ) as @xmath31 therefore on long time scales for which @xmath32 one expects the flow to be viscosity ( @xmath33 ) dominated .",
    "as one starts probing shorter time scales , one expects a transition from a viscous response to an elastic one to take place for @xmath34 .",
    "since for a bacterial bath @xmath35 we arrive at the following important quantitative point .",
    "_ unlike a colloidal bath where the onset of propagating shear waves takes place on time scales @xmath13 , in a bacterial bath we predict that this would happen on time scales @xmath12_. thus , if a bacterial bath is perturbed at a frequency of @xmath36 one would notice a transition from a viscous relaxing behavior to an _ elastic propagating one_. piezoelectric bimorphs can be used to produce and detect controlled shear motions at a frequency @xmath37 @xcite in a bacterial bath .",
    "in contrast , in order to see the propagation of shear waves in a colloidal liquid one needs to perturb it at a high frequency @xmath38 .",
    "a bacterial bath thus provides us with a `` scaled up '' non - equilibrium statistical mechanical system .",
    "this is the key qualitatively and quantitatively interesting observation made in this paper .",
    "we will analyze the emergence of shear waves in some more detail below .",
    "an analysis based on memory function formalism can be used to obtain a statistical mechanical description of the transverse current fluctuations in a bacterial bath . in this formalism the spectrum @xmath39 of transverse current fluctuations ( i.e. the fourier - laplace transform of the transverse current autocorrelation function @xmath40 ) takes the form : @xmath41 } .",
    "\\label{transc}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the pertinent memory function which converges to the hydrodynamic viscosity @xmath23 in the long wavelength and long time limit . modelling the memory function in the time domain as @xmath43",
    "we arrive at the following expression for the real part @xmath44 of the spectrum @xmath39 of transverse current fluctuations : @xmath45 } .",
    "\\label{transcurr}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the wave vector dependent lifetime of correlated structures in the bacterial bath ; @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the mass density of a bacterial swirl .",
    "we can now establish the criterion for the existence of propagating transverse modes . from eq.([transcurr ] ) it is clear that the condition for @xmath44 to have a peak at a nonzero frequency , i.e. the threshold condition for shear waves to propagate at a finite speed is @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding value for the critical wavevector is @xmath51 which corresponds to a length scale of the order of the spatial scale @xmath10 of a bacterial swirl .",
    "thus , as one starts sweeping over wavevectors , the form of the spectrum @xmath44 changes from a profile peaked around @xmath52 for @xmath53 to one peaked around a finite nonzero frequency @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath56 ) .",
    "using @xmath57 , @xmath58 and an appropriate value of @xmath49 based on experimental observations @xcite one can thus calculate the high frequency rigidity modulus @xmath24 for a bacterial bath .",
    "there have been some interesting studies of brownian motion of spherical probes in wormlike micelles@xcite where they study the role of polymer solutions in determining diffusion behavior of probes .",
    "the focus of the work presented here is quite different from that .",
    "we focus on a super - diffusive to diffusive behavior of the type that is observed , for instance , in a simple liquid where a ballistic to diffusive transition takes place at a typical relaxation time scale @xcite .",
    "this leads to an interesting viscoelastic effect . to summarize",
    ", we predict an _ onset of shear waves _ in a bacterial bath at @xmath37 as a result of structural ordering on _ larger length scales _ compared to that in a dense viscous colloidal liquid .",
    "this is a consequence of a large spatial scale arising from the swirl size of the bacteria forming the bath .",
    "this enables us to view a bacterial bath as a ` scaled up ' dense viscous liquid .",
    "furthermore , our work points to an _ independent test _ of structural ordering in a bacterial bath .",
    "we expect this work to generate interest in testing the predictions through computer simulations and experiments in bacterial baths .",
