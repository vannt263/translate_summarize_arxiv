    "dwarf galaxies are by far the most numerous galaxies in the universe ( e.g. mateo 1998 ) and play a crucial role in our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "they are proposed to be the building - blocks in hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation ( kauffmann et al .",
    "dwarf galaxies are typically metal - poor ( e.g. mateo 1998 ) , and have low stellar masses .",
    "the low metallicities of these systems make them having similar conditions of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "therefore , dwarf galaxies at the local universe can be used as a proxy to reveal the physical properties of some galaxies at the early universe .",
    "based on their morphological properties and luminosity , dwarf galaxies can be classified into different types , e.g. , blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , dwarf irregulars ( dis ) , and etc .",
    "bcds , which are the focus of the current paper , have dramatically different properties compared to normal dwarf galaxies ( zwicky 1966 ; gil de paz et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter g03 ) .",
    "they are small , gas - rich ( hi mass fraction typically higher than 30% ; please see section 2.3 and 3.1 ) extragalactic objects . being metal - poor ( @xmath0 , here @xmath1 ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2001 ; asplund et al .",
    "2009 ) ; e.g. terlevich et al .",
    "1991 ; izotov et al .",
    "1994 ; izotov & thuan 1999 ; hunter & hoffman 1999 ) , these galaxies are allowing us to study the star formation and chemical enrichment in a near - primordial environment .",
    "as such , they are important to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "bcds are spectroscopically characterized by a faint , blue optical continuum accompanied , in most cases , by intense and narrow emission lines , due to the intense star formation activity distributed in one to several star - forming regions ( cairs et al .",
    ". des have smooth visual appearances and low gas content , and they represent the bright , gas - poor dwarf galaxies which have little star formation ( e.g. binggeli 1994 ) . by contrast , dis are characterized by a lack of spiral arms and an irregular visual appearance ( see review by hunter 1997 ) .",
    "they have low dust content ( e.g. , calzetti 2001 ) and large gas reservoirs ( see , e.g. , hoffman et al .",
    "central surface brightness increases with increasing luminosity in all of these types of dwarf galaxies ( see recent review of tolstoy et al . 2009 ) , thus it seems natural to consider a possible evolutionary relationship between bcds , dis and des ( e.g. thuan 1985 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "however , the relation between bcds , dis , and des / dsphs remains unclear .",
    "current knowledge bearing on this question comes mainly from analysis of the photometric properties ( such as structure , surface brightness profile , and color ) of these three types of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. thuan 1985 ; james 1994 ; papaderos et al . 1996 ; noeske et al .",
    "2000 ; gil de paz & madore 2005 ; vaduvescu et al .",
    "the results from different authors seem to be contradictory .",
    "for example , thuan ( 1985 ) suggests that bcds and dis are the same type of galaxy , differing only in their present star formation rate , and they can evolve into des .",
    "however , james ( 1994 ) obtains an opposite result that bcds are probably des undergoing starburst activities , while dis are a fundamentally distinct population from them . the results in papaderos et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that bcds have a brighter central surface brightness and a smaller exponential scale length than dis and des at a given @xmath2-band luminosity .",
    "however , gil de paz & madore ( 2005 ) claim that at least @xmath315% of bcds in their sample have structural properties compatible with being des ( also see papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ) experiencing a burst of star formation , whereas vaduvescu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) conclude that bcds have similar structures to dis .",
    "recently , vaduvescu & mccall ( 2008 ) suggest that there are strong connections among bcds , dis , and des since these galaxies lie precisely on a fundamental plane defined by the @xmath4-band absolute magnitude , the central surface brightness , and the neutral hydrogen line width ( also see mccall et al . 2012 ) .",
    "some other attempts to address this issue rely on the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "richer & mccall ( 1995 ) show that [ o / fe ] for a number of field des are larger than those in field dis at similar luminosities and conclude that there is unlikely an evolutionary connection between des and dis .",
    "vaduvescu et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter vmr07 ) argue that the evolution of bcds has been similar to that of dis since they have the same metallicity - gas fraction correlations",
    ". however , the sample in vmr07 is too small ( 14 bcds ) , and therefore might suffer large uncertainties .",
    "moreover , the correlation between metallicity and the gas fraction for bcds and dis shows large dispersions ( see figure 10 in vmr07 ) .    in our previous works , we have studied the luminosity ( or mass)-metallicity ( _ l - z _ ) relation ( zhao et al .",
    "2010 ; hereafter zgg10 ) , stellar population and star formation ( zhao et al . 2011 ; hereafter zgg11 ) for a sample of bcds .",
    "our results show that bcds are old systems currently experiencing starbursts , and follow a well - defined _ l - z _  relation .",
    "based on these two works and g03 , along with hi  data compiled from literature ( see reference in table 1 ) , we can further investigate the evolution of gaseous and chemical properties of bcds .",
    "in this paper , we will explore correlations among different galactic parameters , i.e. oxygen abundance , stellar mass , gas mass , baryonic mass , and gas mass fraction .",
    "we also compare these relations for morphologically different types of bcds and dis .",
    "our investigations on such correlations may shed some light on the answer to the question of whether there is an evolutionary connection between bcds , dis and des .",
    "the paper is organized as following : section 2 describes the sample of bcds and the data . in section 3 ,",
    "we first calculate the gas masses using the compiled hi  fluxes and derive the stellar masses , and then present several relationships involving stellar mass , gas mass and oxygen abundance .",
    "we also do some comparisons between dis and bcds in this section . based on the results shown in section 3",
    ", we discuss possible evolutionary connections between different types of dwarf galaxies , and gas flows in bcds , in section 4 .",
    "a brief summary is given in the last section .",

    "the stellar mass , @xmath231 , of a galaxy , can be derived from its luminosity and mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath232 ) , which can be estimated by comparing observed galaxy colors ( e.g. bell & de jong 2001 ) , broadband spectral energy distributions ( e.g. walcher et al .",

    "due to the ongoing starburst activities in bcds , we prefer to use the near infrared luminosity ( @xmath234 ) and @xmath235 to calculate the stellar mass .",
    "this is because that the @xmath236-band luminosity is relatively less sensitive to recent star formation activity and dust extinction , and can well approximate the stellar mass of a galaxy . the @xmath235 ratio - color relation , as given by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) , is applied to correct for the dependence of @xmath235 on star formation history . for our metal - poor bcds , we adopt the result derived with metallicity @xmath237 . in addition , 15 galaxies in our sample have both optical spectra and nir photometric data .",
    "therefore , we can compare the derived stellar masses .",
    "we find that the nir - based stellar masses are systematically larger ( 0.11 dex with a dispersion of 0.23 dex ) than spectrum - based ones .",
    "therefore , we subtract this systematic difference from the nir - based stellar masses . the results obtained with this method",
    "are also listed in table 1 , as represented by 1 in column 10 .",
    "eleven galaxies of our sample have neither optical spectra nor nir photometry . for these galaxies we use @xmath216-band data and the @xmath238-color relation in bell & de jong ( 2001 ) to calculate their stellar masses .",
    "the @xmath216-band data might be more affected by recent star formation and extinction than nir data . to check to what extent",
    ", we compare the @xmath216-band - based stellar masses with spectrum - based ones for 21 galaxies . we find that , in general , @xmath216-band - based stellar masses are 0.16 dex ( with a dispersion of 0.27 dex ) larger than spectrum - based ones .",
    "hence , a correction of -0.16 dex is applied to the @xmath216-band - based stellar masses , as represented by 4 in column 10 of table 1 .    as shown above ,",
    "there exist some offsets between the stellar masses derived with different methods .",
    "the most possible reason causing this offset is the star formation histories ( sfhs ) , as discussed in gallazzi & bell ( 2009 ) . for galaxies with busty ( or continuous )",
    "sfhs , such as bcds , the one color - based mass - to - light ratio is generally overestimated by 0.1 - 0.2 dex ( gallazzi & bell 2009 ) , which agrees well with our results .",
    "the dust might also play a role in this discrepancy since we do not correct for the internal extinction for the optical data .",
    "however , dust extinction decreases the luminosity and reddens the optical color . to first - order , these effects cancel out , and the estimated stellar mass of a galaxy is almost unaffected even if a moderate internal extinction of @xmath239 mag is assumed ( using the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) extinction law ) . the uncertainty in the derived stellar mass depends majorly on the uncertainties of models , galaxy evolution prescription , and sfhs , which are all of order of 0.1 - 0.2 dex or less ( bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopt a statistical uncertainty of 0.3 dex for our results .    the stellar masses for the di sample are derived with a two - component (  young \" plus  old \" ) method ( lee et al . 2003 ) . to check whether this method is consistent with ours , we calculated the @xmath240 using the @xmath241 color and @xmath242-color relation given by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) for the di sample , and then compared them with those derived with the two - component method .",
    "we found that the one - color based @xmath242 is systematically larger by 0.14 dex , with a scatter of 0.11 dex , than that derived with the two - component method .",
    "this is generally in accordance with the result described above .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the methods used to determine the stellar masses for the di and bcd sample are consistent .      the total mass of atomic hydrogen , @xmath243 , in solar masses , can be derived from the hi  21 cm observations by using the following equation ( roberts 1975 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ) : @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the 21 cm flux integral in jy km s@xmath218 and @xmath246",

    "is given by @xmath247 where x is the fraction of the gas mass in the form of hydrogen , here adopted to be 0.733 ( lee et al .",
    "2003 ) in consideration of the similar range of metallicity and the consistency between the di and bcd samples . in table 1 we include the logarithm of the total gas mass for our bcd sample , calculated from @xmath245 ( collected from literature ; see references in table 1 ) and the distance modulus included in the second column .",
    "the gas fraction , which is a natural parameter for quantifying to what degree a galaxy has exhausted its available fuel supply , is defined as @xmath248 where the total mass in baryons , @xmath249 , is taken to be the mass of gas and stars .",
    "the gas fraction is a distance - independent quantity , because the gas mass and stellar mass are both derived from electromagnetic fluxes .",
    "derived gas fractions for the sample of bcds are summarized in table 1 . for the bcds in our sample ,",
    "about 75% have their @xmath250 , and the median value of @xmath251 is 0.57 .",
    "the total gas mass and stellar mass in our bcd sample both range from @xmath252 to @xmath253 @xmath254 .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of total gas mass as a function of stellar mass for e - type and i - type bcds . the solid line is a reference line for the case when the two qualities are the same .",
    "we find that , almost all i - type bcds lie above the @xmath255 line , whereas more than half of the e - type bcds just below this line , indicating that i - type bcds tend to have larger gas masses than e - type bcds at a given stellar mass . for i - type bcds , except for the apparent merging system , mrk 108 , whose gas content is extraordinarily high , the gas mass well correlates with the stellar mass , namely galaxies with a larger stellar mass also contains higher gas masses .",
    "the e - type bcds seem to have a similar @xmath256 relation when @xmath257 @xmath254 . while at the high - mass end ( @xmath258 ) , galaxies tend to have lower gas contents comparing to the lower mass counterparts . as a comparison , in figure 2 we also plot the data for field dis which are adopted from lee el al .",

    "we plot the number distribution of gas fraction , @xmath259 , in e- and i - type bcds , and field dis . as mentioned above ,",
    "i - type bcds are generally more gas - rich than e - type bcds .",
    "the separation between these types of bcds is more striking in figure 3 .",
    "the @xmath260 for e - type bcds shows a wide distribution and ranges from @xmath261 to @xmath262 , and has a median value of @xmath263 .",
    "however , the distribution of @xmath260 for i - type bcds is much narrower , and looks similar to that for field dis .",
    "i - type bcds concentrate between @xmath264 ( 14 out of 17 ) , while relatively more field dis have @xmath265 .",
    "the median values of @xmath260 are @xmath266 and @xmath267 , for i - type bcds and field dis , respectively .    to quantify the significance of the difference or similarity of the gas content among these different types of galaxies , we perform a nonparametric statistical test , the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "the k - s test for the i - type sample against the e - type sample rejects the null hypothesis ( that these two data sets can be derived from a same parent population ) at a @xmath268 significance level . on the other hand ,",
    "the k - s tests give probabilities of @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 , for the dis vs i- and e - type bcds , all bcds as a whole , data sets , respectively .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the gas fraction distributions of i- and e - type bcds are much different , whereas the gas fraction distributions of dis and bcds seem to be indistinguishable . nevertheless , we caution that such analysis is possibly limited by the small numbers of the samples .",
    "we show the gas fraction of different types of galaxies plotted against their stellar mass in figure 4 . at the low - mass end ( @xmath272 ) , in general",
    ", the gas mass is roughly independent on the stellar mass ( i.e. proportional to the baryonic mass ) . at higher masses",
    ", however , the relation exhibits a break and becomes considerably steeper since the gas has been more efficiently converted to stars in higher stellar mass galaxies .",
    "from figure 4 we can see that most bcds and field dis distributes similarly in the @xmath259-@xmath231 plot .",
    "however , at a given stellar mass , the gas fractions for e - type bcds have a larger span and a lower mean value than those for i - type bcds and field dis , which confirms that e - type bcds are generally more gas - poor .",

    "field dis have a shallower @xmath279 relation than bcds , but are mixed with bcds in the plot . combining this difference with the fact that i - type bcds are more gas - rich than e - type bcds ( see section 3.2 )",

    "the dashed and dot - dashed lines superposed in figure 7 are the respective fitting results for i - type bcds and dis .",
    "these results show that the baryonic mass - metallicity relations for i- and e - type bcds have similar slopes , which are a bit steeper than that of field dis . however , e - type bcds appear to lie at a higher oxygen abundance comparing with i - type ones at a given baryonic mass , which again seems to suggest that e- and i - type bcds might be at different evolutionary phases and/or have different progenitors .",
    "in fact , bcds also have steeper _ l - z _  and mass - metallicity ( _ m - z _ ) relations than dis ( zgg10 ; zahid et al .",
    "kunth & stlin ( 2000 ) show that there exist offsets between the @xmath2 band _ l - z _  relations of bcds , dis and des / dsphs , in the sense that at a given @xmath2 luminosity it becomes relatively more metal - deficient following the des / dsphs , dis and bcds sequence .",
    "this offset persists even only comparing the metallicities of the old populations in dis and des / dsphs ( grebel et al .",

    "( 2008 ) find the same phenomenon in the _ m - z _  relations of dis and des / dsphs . in the current work , however , we find that dis distribute in between the two types of bcds in the baryonic - metallicity relation .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary connections , if exist , between des , dis , and bcds may be complicated .",
    "the relation between metallicity and gas fraction can be used to check different chemical evolution models .",
    "the closed - box model predicts a linear correlation between the logarithm of the inverse gas fraction @xmath283 and the oxygen abundance by number , @xmath284 , namely ( e.g. lee et al . 2003 ) @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the yield of oxygen and we have assumed that the fraction of gas in the form of hydrogen is @xmath287 ( solar value ) .    a comparison of the observed oxygen abundances to those predicted by closed - box models ( thick solid line ) is shown in figure 8 , which indicates that few of the galaxies in these bcd and di samples agree with a closed - box chemical evolution .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies appear to have oxygen abundances less than that expected by closed - box models ( with a salpeter imf ) , which imply varying imf , and/or gas inflows / outflows in these galaxies .",
    "it is also interesting to find that i - type bcds and dis occupy a similar region in this plot , whereas e - type bcds extend to the most metal - rich and gas - poor region .",
    "this indicates that ( 1 ) these galaxies follow a similar chemical evolution path ( e.g. experiencing similar gas flows ) , but at different phase ( e.g. e - type bcds are more evolved than dis and i - type bcds ) ; or ( 2 ) e - type bcds experience different gas flows from dis and i - type bcds ( see below ) .",
    "the effects of inflows and/or outflows have been described by many authors ( e.g. , edmunds 1990 ; dalcanton 2007 ; erb 2008 ; matteucci 2008 ; spitoni et al .",
    "in particular , dalcanton ( 2007 ) shows that inflows are very efficient in reducing the effective yield , @xmath288 , for gas - poor galaxies while outflows are more effective in changing @xmath288 in gas - rich galaxies .",
    "erb ( 2008 ) and matteucci ( 2008 ) introduce a model in which galaxies have inflows / outflows proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "this model adopts the instance recycling and mixing approximations , and the infalling gas is assumed to have no metal , while the enriched outflows is considered to have the same metallicity as the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this model , we can change two free parameters , the amount of outflow @xmath289 and inflow @xmath290 in unit of the sfr of the galaxy , to reproduce the observed oxygen abundance .",
    "two more parameters can be varied , if necessary , i.e. , the true yield @xmath291 ( i.e. imf ) and the fraction @xmath292 of mass still locked in stars .    in figure 8",
    "we also plot the predicted metallicity - gas fraction relations from this model using different parameters .",
    "we adopt @xmath286 as 1 and @xmath293 of the true oxygen yield predicted by the closed - box model with a salpeter imf(@xmath294 ; meynet & maeder 2002 ) , and vary @xmath289 and @xmath290 to reproduce the dependence of oxygen abundance on the inverse gas fraction . the parameter @xmath292 is a slowly decreasing function of time , as more stars leave the main sequence , but can vary in quite a small range .",
    "it is expected to be @xmath295 at @xmath296 yr and @xmath297 at @xmath298 yr ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) for sub - solar metallicity galaxies with a salpeter imf . given the age of these galaxies ( see , e.g. zgg11 ) , we have used @xmath299 , in despite of that the results are not very sensitive to the chosen value .    for a salpeter imf , as shown in figure 8 , the pure inflow model ( black dotted lines ) with a variable rate can not explain the observed metallicity - gas fraction relation , ( especially for e - type bcds ) , which is consistent with the finding in spitoni et al .",
    "small inflow rate predicts a higher metallicity than the observed one , whereas high inflow rate can not reach the gas - poor region .",

    "in this section we will mainly discuss the possible evolutionary connections between bcds , des and dis .",
    "there have been several evolutionary scenarios , both from observational and theoretical aspects , between bcds , des , and dis ( see papaderos et al .",
    "1996 for a review ) .",
    "however , the question of whether there is an evolutionary connection between these three types of dwarf galaxies have not been achieved a solid answer yet . as mentioned in section 1 ,",
    "some apparently contrary results are present in previous studies on the basis of observational measurements .    for the bcds in our sample ,",
    "metallicity correlates with gas mass and total baryonic mass , in the sense that more massive systems are more abundant in metals .",
    "for these two correlations , i - type bcds show similar slopes to e - type ones . however , i - type bcds are generally more metal - poor and gas - rich than e - type ones at a given gas / baryonic mass . although field dis seem to have a shallower slope relative to bcds , they are well mixed with bcds in the distributions of @xmath279 and @xmath300 plots .",
    "moreover , in the plot of metallicity - gas fraction relation , i - type bcds generally occupy a region differing from e - type ones .",
    "our results may shed some light on the evolutionary connection between the three types of dwarf galaxies .",
    "i- and e - type bcds might be at different evolutionary phases and/or have different progenitors .",
    "for example , if some e - type bcds are formed from des ( e.g. silk et al .",
    "1987 ) , whereas i - type ones are formed from dis , then this part of e - type bcds should be more evolved than i - type ones .",
    "this scenario is also supported by the fact that many e - type bcds show structural properties compatible with des ( papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ; gil de paz & madore 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , field dis show chemical and gaseous properties in between i- and e - type bcds , which suggests that they could be connected to both types of bcds ( e.g. thuan 1985 ; davies & phillipps 1988 ) .    as discussed in papaderos et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the interchanges between dis , bcds and des need gas outflows / inflows to get involved , which is very consistent with our result that most bcds should have experienced gas flows during their lives .",
    "indeed , observations have provided ( direct ) evidence for gas flows in bcds ( e.g. , papaderos et al .",

    "we have presented a detailed studies on the gaseous and chemical properties of a sample of 53 bcds , which is selected from g03/zgg10 sample . according to their morphological information , this sample of bcds",
    "is divided into two subsamples : e- and i - type bcd samples .",
    "an e - type bcd contains an elliptical outer component while an i - type bcd has an irregular outer halo .    for both types of bcds , various correlations among metallicity , gaseous , stellar and baryonic mass , and gas fraction ,",
    "are investigated .",
    "we find that in general , ( 1 ) more massive systems are more metal - rich , ( 2 ) a galaxy having a larger stellar mass also contains more gas , but a smaller gas fraction , ( 3 ) i- and e - type bcds have similar slopes of the @xmath279 and @xmath300 relations , but i - type bcds are generally more gas - rich and metal - poor .",
    "based on the comparisons of these correlations , we suggest that i- and ( at least a part of ) e - type bcds might be likely at different evolutionary stages and/or having progenitors . by comparing the metallicity - gas fraction relation for our sample with those predicted by chemical evolution models , we conclude that most bcds",

    "<S> in this paper , we report our studies on the gaseous and chemical properties of a relatively large sample ( 53 members ) of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of correlations among the oxygen abundance , stellar mass , gas mass , baryonic mass , and gas fraction are present both for e- and i - type bcds , which are classified according to loose & thuan ( 1985 ) and show elliptical and irregular outer haloes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations of i - type bcds show similar slopes to those of e - type ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , in general , e - type bcds are more gas - poor and metal - rich than i - type ones at a given baryonic mass . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that e - type bcds , at least a part of them , and i - type ones might be likely at different evolutionary phases and/or having different progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation of the correlation between oxygen abundance and gas fraction shows that bcds appear to have not evolved as isolated systems , but to have experienced some gas flows and/or mergers . </S>"
