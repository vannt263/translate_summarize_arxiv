    "recent cosmological and astrophysical data obtained with observations done thanks to the supernova cosmology project , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and the planck satellites , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and x - ray experiments @xcite give clear indications that the observable present day universe is experiencing a phase of expansion with accelerated rate , which is practically the expansion with accelerated rate which the universe undergoes , with the first happened during the inflationary period . the present day",
    "cosmic acceleration is one of the biggest challenges in the understanding of the standard models of gravity and particle physics .",
    "+ three main different classes of models have been suggested and well studied till now with the aim to give a proper explanation to the accelerated expansion of the present day observable universe :    1 .   the cosmological constant ( cc ) @xmath13 model ; 2 .",
    "dark energy ( de ) models ; 3 .",
    "theories of modified gravity models .",
    "the first and also the simplest candidate introduced with the aim to explain the present day observed accelerated expansion of the universe is the cosmological constant @xmath13 , which can be considered as an extra term added to einstein s equations .",
    "one of the main features of the cosmological constant @xmath13 is that it has an equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath14 exactly equal to @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 . according to what we know thanks to the quantum field theory ( qft ) , a cut - off at the planck ( or at the electro - weak scale ) leads to the production of a cosmological constant @xmath13 which is of the order of @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) , respectively , times bigger than the value we are able to observe .",
    "the fact that we still do not have a fundamental symmetry which is able to put the precise value of the cosmological constant @xmath13 to exactly zero ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) or , instead , to a very small value ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) produces the so - called cosmological constant problem , also known as fine tuning problem .",
    "moreover , it is also well - known that the cosmological constat @xmath13 model is affected by another problem , which is the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem states that the dm and the vacuum energy are almost equal at the present epoch of the universe even if they had an independent evolution and they had an evolution starting from different mass scales .",
    "many proposals have been suggested till now with the purpose and the hope to obtain an explanation to the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "+ the second class of models which are suggested and widely studied with the aim to give a plausible explanation to the present day accelerated expansion of the universe considers dark energy ( de ) models .",
    "+ the observational evidences of the cosmic accelerated expansion imply that , if , on cosmological scale , the theory of einstein s general relativity ( gr ) is valid , we must have that the present day observable universe must have as dominant component an unknown missing energy component which has some particular features , in particular : 1 ) its pressure @xmath21 must be sufficiently negative if it wants to be able to produce the rate of accelerated expansion of the universe we are able to observe and 2 ) it must not be clustered on cosmological scales ( i.e. on large scale length ) .",
    "the present day observed cosmic accelerated expansion of the universe can be described , in relativistic cosmology , introducing a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath22 and pressure @xmath21 satisfying the following condition : @xmath23 ( which implies that the pressure @xmath21 must be negative in order the condition is satisfied ) .",
    "this kind of fluid with a sufficient negative pressure @xmath21 in order to satisfy the condition @xmath24 is referred as dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the fact that the relation @xmath23 must be satisfied leads to the fact that the eos parameter @xmath25 ( defined as the ratio of the pressure @xmath21 and the energy density @xmath26 ) satisfies the following condition : @xmath27 .",
    "instead , from an observational point of view , it is still a challenging task to constrain its exact value . the fundamental theory which can explain the microscopic physics of de is still not known up to now , for this reason scientists continue to reconstruct and suggest different possible models which are mainly based on its macroscopic behavior .",
    "+ furthermore , recent cosmological experiments and observations have clearly indicated that the largest part of the total energy density @xmath28 of the present universe is contained in the two dark sectors @xcite , i.e. de and dm , which represent , respectively , the 68.3@xmath29 and the 26.8@xmath29 of the total energy density of the present day observable universe .",
    "we also know that the baryonic matter ( bm ) we are able to observe with our scientific instruments contributes only for approximately the @xmath30 of the total energy density @xmath28 of the present day universe .",
    "moreover , we have that the contribution produced by the radiation term to the total cosmic energy density @xmath28 can be safely considered practically negligible , i.e we have that @xmath31 . + other different candidates introduced and suggested for the de problem are given by the dynamical de scenarios with a time dependent eos parameter @xmath14 , then not anymore constant . according to analysis of the available sne ia observational data",
    ", it has been derived that time - varying de models lead to a better fit compared with a model with cosmological constant @xmath13 .",
    "there are two main different categories suggested for dynamical de scenarios : ( i ) scalar fields models , which include k - essence @xcite , quintessence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , phantom @xcite , dilaton @xcite and quintom field @xcite , ( ii ) interacting de models , which include for example chaplygin gas @xcite and agegraphic de ( ade ) models @xcite .",
    "+ the complete description of the de features and nature must come from a consistent theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) . unfortunately , we still do not have a complete and widely accepted theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) and then some approximations for this theory can be made : some examples are given by the loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) and string theory .",
    "+ the third and last class of models proposed in order to give an explanation to the present day accelerated expansion of universe involves extended theories of gravity , which correspond to a modification of the action of the gravitational fields .",
    "some of the most famous and studied models of modified gravity are the @xmath32 modified gravity model ( with @xmath33 being the torsion scalar ) , braneworld models , the @xmath34 modified gravity model ( with @xmath35 being the gauss - bonnet invariant defined as @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the ricci curvature tensor and @xmath38 being the riemann curvature tensor ) , the @xmath39 modified gravity model ( with @xmath40 being the ricci scalar curvature ) , the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model , the @xmath41 modified gravity model , the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) model and the brans - dicke model @xcite .",
    "+ using the holographic principle which was recently introduced by fischler @xmath42 susskind @xcite , a model dubbed as holographic de ( hde ) model has been recently proposed in the paper of li @xcite .",
    "the hde model is one of the most famous and studied candidate of de @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the holographic principle assumes a fundamental role in both black hole and string theories .",
    "it was recently demonstrated in the work of cohen et al .",
    "@xcite that , in the framework of the qft , the uv cut - off , which is indicated with @xmath43 , is related to the ir cut - off , which is given by @xmath44 , due to the limitations produced by the formation of a black hole .",
    "if the vacuum energy @xmath45 density produced by the uv cut - off is given by the relation @xmath46 , then we have that the total energy density of a given size @xmath44 must be less or at least equal to the mass corresponding to the system - size black hole , i.e. we must have that : @xmath47 which implies that : @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the reduced planck mass and @xmath50 represents the newton s gravitational constant .",
    "if the largest possible cut - off @xmath44 of the system is that one which is able to saturate the inequality given in eq . ( [ 1cinzia ] )",
    ", we derive the following expression for the energy density @xmath45 of the hde model : @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents a dimensionless constant parameter .",
    "it has been obtained that , in the case of a universe that is not flat ( i.e. for a value of the curvature parameter which is different from zero ) the value of such constant is given by @xmath53 while for a flat universe ( i.e. when the curvature parameter is equal to zero ) , we have that the value of @xmath52 is given by @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the expression of the energy density @xmath26 of the hde model can be also obtain using a different approach @xcite .",
    "it must be here underlined that the black hole entropy @xmath55 has an important role in the derivation of the hde energy density @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , we know that the derivation of the hde energy density strongly depends on the entropy - area relation given , in einstein s gravity , by the relation @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 gives the area of the black hole horizon ) . according to the laws of the thermodynamics of black holes @xcite , a maximum value of the entropy in a box with a dimension of @xmath44 ( which is also referred as bekenstein - hawking entropy bound ) , is given by the relation @xmath58 , which goes as the area @xmath57 of the box ( given approximatively by the expression @xmath59 ) rather than the volume @xmath60 of the box ( which is given by @xmath61 ) .",
    "moreover , for macroscopic systems having some self - gravitation effects which can not be ignored , we have that the expression of the bekenstein entropy bound ( which is indicated with @xmath62 ) can be obtained multiplying the energy @xmath63 , given by the relation @xmath64 , and the linear size @xmath44 of the system . if we impose that the bekenstein entropy bound must be smaller than the bekenstein - hawking entropy ( i.e. , if we impose that @xmath65 , which implies that @xmath66 ) , we obtain the same result obtained from energy bound arguments , i.e. we obtain that @xmath67 .",
    "+ using the holographic principle , cohen et al . @xcite recently proposed that the vacuum energy density must be proportional to the hubble parameter @xmath68 . in this particular model , both the fine - tuning and coincidence problems can be solved , but it is still not possible to give a reasonable explanation to the present day cosmic accelerated expansion of the universe since the effective equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath69 for such vacuum energy is equal to zero , then it is different from what it is requested for the hde model . in a recent paper ,",
    "li @xcite suggested that the future event horizon of the universe can be used as possible ir cut - off .",
    "this de model not only has a reasonable value for the de energy density but it also leads to an accelerated solution for the cosmological expansion .",
    "+ jamil et al .",
    "@xcite studied the eos parameter @xmath5 of the hde model choosing a newton s gravitational constant @xmath70 which is not constant but it is time dependent , i.e. we have @xmath71 ; furthermore , they obtained that the eos parameter @xmath5 can be significantly modified when the low - redshift @xmath72 limit is considered .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite studied the hde model in order to obtain an inflationary epoch in the early evolutionary stages of our universe .",
    "the hde model was recently considered in other works with different ir cut - offs , for example the hubble horizon , the particle horizon and the future event horizon @xcite .",
    "moreover , correspondences between some scalar field models and the hde model have been recently proposed @xcite , while in other works , the hde model was accurately studied in different modified gravity theories , like for example scalar - tensor gravity , @xmath73 , dgp model , braneworld and brans - dicke cosmology @xcite . + different hde models",
    "have also been constrained and tested by using different astronomical and cosmological observations @xcite and also thanks to the anthropic principle @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the hde model fits well cosmological data obtained using the data obtained from observations of sneia and cmb radiation anisotropies @xcite . + the definition of the entropy - area relation can be modified considering quantum effects which are motivated from the loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "the relation entropy - area @xmath74 has an interesting modification ( correction ) , i.e. the power - law correction @xcite which arises in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields in and out the horizon .",
    "+ the power - law corrected entropy - area relation @xmath75 has the following specific form @xcite : @xmath76,\\label{powerlawentropyold}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the term @xmath77 is given by the following power - law relation : @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 indicating two constant parameters , @xmath81 being the uv cut - off at the horizon and @xmath82 being a fractional power which depends on the amount of mixing of ground and excited states . for a large horizon area ( i.e. for @xmath83 ) , the contribution given by the term @xmath84 to the entropy @xmath75 can be considered practically negligible and , therefore , the mixed state entanglement entropy asymptotically approaches the ground state ( bekenstein - hawking ) entropy . +",
    "another useful way to write the expression of the entropy area relation @xmath75 for the power - law corrected entropy is given by the following relation : @xmath85 with @xmath2 representing a dimensionless constant parameter and the term @xmath86 is a constant which is defined as follows : @xmath87 where the term @xmath88 indicates the cross - over scale .",
    "moreover , we have that the quantity @xmath89 gives the area of the horizon ( with the term @xmath90 indicating the radius of the horizon ) .",
    "the second term present in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) gives the power - law correction to the entropy - area law . in order",
    "the entropy is a well - defined quantity , we need to have that the parameter @xmath2 is positive defined , i.e. we must have that the condition @xmath91 must be satisfied .",
    "motivated by the relation defined in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , a new version of hde ( also known with the name of power - law entropy - corrected hde ( plechde ) model ) was recently introduced as follows : @xmath92 with @xmath93 being a positive dimensionless parameter and @xmath94 begin a positive exponent .",
    "+ in the limiting case of @xmath95 ( or , equivalently , for @xmath96 ) , eq .",
    "( [ lgo2 ] ) reduces to the well - known expression of the hde energy density . the correction term present in eq .",
    "( [ lgo2 ] ) is of the same order of to the first one only when @xmath44 assumes a very small value .",
    "then , at the very early evolutionary phases and stages of our universe history ( i.e. , when the universe underwent the inflationary phase ) , the contribution of the correction term in the plechde energy density can be safely considered relevant but , when the universe became larger , the plechde energy density reduced to the ordinary hde energy density .",
    "therefore , plechde model can be also considered as a model of entropic cosmology which is able to unify the early - time inflation and late - time cosmic acceleration of the universe .",
    "+ in some recent works , hoava @xcite recently introduced a new theory of gravity which is renormalizable with higher spatial derivatives in four dimensions .",
    "this theory leads to the einstein s gravity ( i.e. to gr ) with non - vanishing value of the cosmological constant @xmath13 in the infrared ( ir ) limit and it also have some improved behaviors and features in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regime .",
    "hoava gravity can be also considered similar to a scalar field theory previously proposed by lifshitz @xcite in which we have that the temporal dimension @xmath97 has a weight equal to three if the space dimension has a weight of one .",
    "for this reason , the gravity theory proposed by hoava is also known with the name of hoava - lifshitz gravity . the hoava - lifshitz gravity has been extended and studied in detail in some papers , like for example @xcite , and it has been applied as a possible cosmological framework of our universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , hoava - lifshitz theory is not lorentz invariant ( with the exception of the ir limit ) , test particles do not follow geodesics , it is non - relativistic and we also have that the speed of light @xmath98 diverges in the uv limit .",
    "we have four different versions of hoava - lifshitz theory of gravity : ( i ) with projectability condition , ( ii ) without projectability condition , ( iii ) with detailed balance and ( iv ) without detailed balance . having a first look",
    ", it seems that this model of quantum gravity ( qg ) has a well defined ir limit and it also reduces to general relativity , but as it was obtained by mukohyama @xcite , hoava - lifshitz gravity behaves like general relativity plus dm .",
    "for some relevant works on the scenario where the cosmological evolution is ruled by hoava - lifshitz gravity see @xcite .",
    "+ because of these characteristics , a great effort in extending , examining and improving the physical features and properties of the theory itself have been done @xcite .",
    "furthermore , applications of hoava - lifshitz gravity as a cosmological context produces the hoava - lifshitz cosmology , which has some interesting features . for example",

    "<S> * abstract * : in this paper , we study the power law entropy corrected holographic dark energy ( plechde ) model in the framework of a non - flat universe and of hoava - lifshitz cosmology with infrared cut - off given by recently proposed granda - oliveros cut - off , which contains one term proportional to the hubble parameter squared @xmath0 and one term proportional to the first time derivative of the hubble parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this cut - off is characterized by two constant parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> for the two cases corresponding to non - interacting and interacting de and dark matter ( dm ) , we derive the evolutionary form of the energy density of de @xmath4 , the equation of state ( eos ) parameter of de @xmath5 and the deceleration parameter @xmath6 . using the parametrization of the eos parameter @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the expressions of the two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the statefinder parameters @xmath10 , the snap and lerk cosmographic parameters and the squared speed of the sound @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the values of the quantities we study for different values of the running parameter @xmath12 and for different set of values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . + * keywords * : dark energy ; hoava - lifshitz ; granda - oliveros cut - off . </S>"
