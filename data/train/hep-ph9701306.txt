    "the cp and t violation is a fundamental and important problem of the particle physics and cosmology .",

    "the answer is yes if the neutrinos have masses and complex mixing angles in the electroweak theory .",
    "the neutrino oscillation search is a powerful experiment which can examine masses and mixing angles of the neutrinos .",
    "in fact the several underground experiments have shown lack of the solar neutrinos@xcite and anomaly in the atmospheric neutrinos@xcite , implying that the neutrinos have masses .",

    "the cpt theorem gives the relation between the transition probability of anti - neutrino and that of neutrino , @xmath18 which relates cp violation to t violation : @xmath19      let s consider how large the t(cp ) violation can be in long base line experiments with the assumed mass square differences eq.[eq : mass ] . in long baseline experiments neutrinos have energy of several gev s and the distance of several hundreds km .",

    "neutrinos , however , go through not vacuum but matter , the surface of the earth .",
    "there is an effect by matter .",

    "it requires to subtract such effect in order to deduce the pure cp violation effect@xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible , because the matter effect is proportional to @xmath17 while @xmath46 is constant .    in the matter with constant density requires the exchange of the production point and the detection point and the time reversal of @xmath47 in matter is in general different from @xmath48@xcite . ]",
    ", we have a pure t violation effect @xmath49 , though we do not observe a pure cp violation effect because of an apparent cp violation due to matter .",
    "the pure t violation effect is given by the eq.[eq : bwp ] with mixing matrix and mass square differences in matter .      to calculate how large the t violation is , we have to know the mixing matrix and mass square differences in matter .",
    "when a neutrino is in matter , its matrix of effective mass squared @xmath50 for weak eigenstates is@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath9 is given by eq.[eq : mixingmatrix ] .",
    "this is diagonalized by a mixing matrix @xmath53 as @xmath54 .    up to the leading order of @xmath6 ,",
    "the the eigenvalues of effective mass square(@xmath55 ) and the mixing matrix @xmath53 are given by , @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 with @xmath59    using them , @xmath60 in matter , @xmath61 , takes the form .",
    "@xmath62      for example we consider this case because as mentioned earier this case seems most likely to be realized .",
    "i show the result calculated up to the leading order of two small parameter @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then we have the effective masses @xmath66 and `` mass square difference ratio '' in matter @xmath67 note that @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath61 is given by , @xmath69    the key quantity @xmath70 in matter(see eq.[eq : atbest2 ] ) is then , @xmath71 same as that of vacuum .",
    "using the argument similar to that used to derive equation for t violation in vacuum , we obtain the t violation effect @xmath72 at peaks , where we choose the mean neutrino energy @xmath17 to satisfy ( see table [ table1 ] ) @xmath73    the size of t violation in matter is same as that in vacuum .",
    "incidentally i may remark that there is no correction of o(@xmath74 ) to this value because the limit @xmath75 is smooth .    in the case of large mixing angles",
    "@xcite , @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 are allowed and @xmath79 .",
    "] for example . then the size of t violation @xmath80 we may see a few % of t violation .",
    "numerically it is also confirmed with slowly changing density , which satisfies the condition @xmath81 , up to o(@xmath82 ) .",
    "i assumed the density takes the following form : @xmath83 with @xmath84 and various @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we have examined mainly t violation in the long base line experiment with the assumption that @xmath46 is much smaller than the matter effect `` @xmath87 '' and @xmath88 , that is both the solar neutrino deficit and atmospheric neutrino anomalies are attributed to the neutrino oscillation violation effect . in this case",
    "we can not see pure cp violation because of matter .",
    "a fer % of t violation is , however , observable depending on the parameters for neutrino .",
    "more exactly we may see t violation of o(@xmath89 ) .",
    "the reason of o(@xmath89 ) is as follows : the probability of cp and t violation effect should vanish for @xmath90 0 , and therefore be proportional to @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath93 by the dimensional analysis .",
    "we expected an enhancement for t violation , that is , it is proportional to not o(@xmath89 ) but o(@xmath94 ) .",
    "we have , however , cp and t violation of o(@xmath89 ) because in the limit that @xmath75 they must be smoothly connected to the vacuum case .    99 gallex collaboration , p. anselmann _ et al _ , phys",
