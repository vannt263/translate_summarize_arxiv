    "this article is aimed to demonstrate that the critical behavior of the heisenberg principle ( hp ) can be used as a characterization of qpts as well as entanglement properties , in particular in systems of photons .",
    "since qpts are driven by quantum fluctuations of the fields that define the physical structure of the system , it is rather natural to focus on the simplest measure of those fluctuations , the product @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , and importantly , fluctuations appear in the calculation of the entanglement of many important physical models @xcite .    in the case of light - matter systems , one can derive the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath3 of the photon mode @xmath4 .",

    "<S> quantum phase transitions are often embodied by the critical behavior of purely quantum quantities such as entanglement or quantum fluctuations . in critical regions , we underline a general scaling relation between the entanglement entropy and one of the most fundamental and simplest measure of the quantum fluctuations , the heisenberg uncertainty principle . then , we show that the latter represents a sensitive probe of superradiant quantum phase transitions in standard models of photons such as the dicke hamiltonian , which embodies an ensemble of two - level systems interacting with one quadrature of a single and uniform bosonic field . </S>",
    "<S> we derive exact results in the thermodynamic limit and for a finite number @xmath0 of two - level systems : as a reminiscence of the entanglement properties between light and the two - level systems , the product @xmath1 diverges at the quantum critical point as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize our results to the double quadrature dicke model where the two quadratures of the bosonic field are now coupled to two independent sets of two - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> our findings , which show that the entanglement properties between light and matter can be accessed through the heisenberg uncertainty principle , can be tested using bose - einstein condensates in optical cavities and circuit quantum electrodynamics . </S>"
