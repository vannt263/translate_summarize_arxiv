    "existence of extra neutral gauge bosons has been predicted in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "string - inspired models and grand - unification ( gut ) models usually contain a number of extra @xmath7 symmetries , beyond the hypercharge @xmath8 of the sm .",
    "the exceptional group @xmath1 is one of the famous examples of this type @xcite .",
    "these extra @xmath7 s are broken at some intermediate energy scales between the gut and the electroweak scales .",
    "phenomenologically , the most interesting option is the breaking of these @xmath7 s at around tev scales , giving rise to extra neutral gauge bosons observable at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "recent developments in model buildings also result in new models that contain extra gauge bosons .",
    "for example , little higgs models @xcite with additional gauge groups predict a number of new gauge bosons ; the sm gauge bosons propagating in the extra dimensions after compactification can give rise to kaluza - klein towers of gauge bosons @xcite ; stueckelberg @xmath0 model connecting a hidden sector to the visible sector in the context of dark matter @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "we will denote these neutral extra gauge bosons generically by @xmath0 for the general discussion in this introduction section .",
    "collider experiments such as cdf @xcite and d  @xcite at the tevatron have been searching for the neutral extra gauge bosons @xmath0 , mainly through its leptonic decay modes .",
    "the leptonic mode is a very clean channel to probe for @xmath0 since it may give rise to a discernible peak above the drell - yan background right at the @xmath0 mass , provided that the size of the coupling strength to sm quarks and leptons is not too small .",
    "currently , the best limit comes from the negative search at the tevatron .",
    "the lower mass bound on @xmath0 is about @xmath9 gev for a number of @xmath0 bosons of the @xmath1 type and a stronger bound of almost @xmath10 gev for the sequential @xmath0 , which has exactly the same coupling strength and chiral couplings as the sm @xmath11 boson that can be served as a bench mark .",
    "the lhc with just an integrated luminosity of about @xmath12 pb@xmath4 has already set limits on @xmath0s @xcite almost as good as those from the tevatron . with more luminosity accumulated in the current lhc",
    "run the limit on @xmath0 will improve substantially in the near future .",
    "most of previous studies on @xmath0 bosons focused on the decays into sm fermions , and the corresponding limits were obtained based on the decay into leptons .",
    "this scenario is not necessarily a must , but just for simplicity and fewer choices of parameters . indeed ,",
    "when the mass of @xmath0 is more than a tev or even larger it has chances of decaying into other exotic particles that must be included in the model for various theoretical reasons .",
    "for instance , in gut models or in little - higgs models there are other fermions needed to cancel the anomalies , the @xmath0 could decay into these exotic fermions if their masses are not too heavy .",
    "another example is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with electroweak - scale susy partners and a @xmath0 which could also decay into sfermions and higgsinos . in a recently proposed @xmath0-mediated susy - breaking model @xcite ,",
    "supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector is communicated by a @xmath0 boson to the visible sector .",
    "the low - energy spectrum includes a @xmath0 boson of a few tev and light gauginos , such that the @xmath0 can also decay into susy particles other than the sm fermions .    in this work",
    ", we consider a scenario of @xmath0 boson , which arised from @xmath7 symmetry breaking at around tev scale , in the context of weak - scale supersymmetry , in which all susy partners are relatively light ( a few hundred gev ) except for the squarks ( may of order @xmath13 tev ) .",
    "such a @xmath0 may come from breaking of one of the @xmath7 s in @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , or @xmath14",
    "@xcite etc .",
    "once we specify the @xmath7 charges for the matter superfields and higgs superfields , the couplings of @xmath0 to mssm particles are determined .",
    "we study the decays of @xmath0 and its production at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the decays of @xmath0 will be modified when the susy particle masses are only of order a few hundred gev , which will then affect the leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate how much the limits from the tevatron will be affected , because of the reduction in the leptonic branching ratio .",
    "we also study how much the sensitivity at the lhc will be reduced when the susy decay modes are open for the @xmath0 boson . finally , we study the prospect of using the susy decay modes of the @xmath0 to search for the @xmath0 boson itself and investigate its properties .",
    "we note that some related works had appeared in literature , for example in refs .",
    "however substantial improvements over these previous works have been made in this work .",
    "these include    1 .   ref .",
    "@xcite focused on how the presence of supersymmetric and other exotic particles of @xmath1 models in the @xmath0 decay can affect the @xmath0 boson discovery at the tevatron and the lhc . in our work , we used the most current updated limit on @xmath15 to put limits on the mass of various @xmath0 bosons .",
    "we have illustrated the case of decaying into sm particles only and the case of including both susy and sm particles .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 mass limits have to be relaxed by @xmath16 gev if including susy particles in the decay .",
    "@xcite was written in 2004 and certainly our paper used the newest 2011 data . for the lhc sensitivity we worked out the more realistic energy - luminosity combinations ( 7 tev , 10 tev , 14 tev ) . refs .",
    "@xcite did not know about the options of 7 and 10 tev at their time .",
    "@xcite focused on how the discovery potential of sleptons can be improved via the decay of @xmath0 into a slepton pair .",
    "they also studied various lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) scenarios and used distributions to determine the masses of sleptons , gauginos , and the @xmath0 boson . in our work , in addition to the slepton - pair , we also studied the @xmath0 decays into a chargino pair and into a neutralino pair .",
    "we have shown clearly that the presence of @xmath0 is visible in the transverse - mass spectrum .",
    "one can therefore measure the transverse - mass spectrum and determine if there is a @xmath0 boson .",
    "this spectrum can also be utilized to estimate the mass differences , and couplings of @xmath0 to sleptons , neutralinos , and charginos .",
    "this can help us to understand the underlying supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",
