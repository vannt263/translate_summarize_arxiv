    "the missions of @xmath8factories under constructions are ( i ) to test the cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) _  la _ kobayashi - maskawa scheme @xcite , and ( ii ) to find out any new flavor violation and especially new source of cp violation beyond the km phase in the sm with three generations .",
    "the latter is well motivated by the fact that the km phase in the sm may not be enough to generate the baryon number asymmetry in the universe . in terms of physics view point , the second mission seems more exciting one , since it could uncover a veil beyond the sm and provide an ingredient that is necessary to explain baryon number asymmetry of the universe .",
    "then , one has to seek for a possible signal of new physics in rare decays of @xmath8mesons and cp violation therein .",
    "one could choose his / her own favorite models to work out the consequences of such model to the physics issues that could be investigated at b factories .",
    "or one could work in the effective field theory framework , in a manner as much as model - independent as possible .",
    "in the following , we choose the second avenue to study the possible signals of new physics that could be studied in detail at @xmath9 factories",
    ". then we give explicit examples ( that satisfy our assumptions made in the model independent analysis ) in supersymmetric ( susy ) models with gluino - mediated @xmath10 transition .",
    "if one considers the sm as an effective field theory ( eft ) of more fundamental theories below the scale @xmath11 , the new physics effects will manifest themselves in higher dimensional operators ( dim @xmath12 \\geq 5 $ ] ) that are invariant under the sm gauge group .",
    "several groups have made a list of dimension-5 and dimension-6 operators in the last decade @xcite .",
    "assuming the lepton and baryon number conservations , there are about 80 operators that are independent with each other .",
    "it would be formidable to consider all of such operators at once , even if we are interested in their effects in @xmath9 physics .",
    "however , if we restrict to @xmath13 , only two operators become relevant : @xmath14 after the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking ( @xmath15 is the higgs vacuum expectation value ) . here",
    "s are dimensionless coefficients .",
    "thus the above operators can be recasted into the following form : @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 in the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite ) and @xmath19 the operator @xmath20 is obtained from @xmath21 by the exchange @xmath22 .",
    "similarly one can expect a new physics contribution to @xmath23 : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is obtained from @xmath27 by the exchange @xmath28 .",
    "these two processes @xmath29 and @xmath23 are unique in the sense that they are described in terms of only two independent operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 whatever new physics there are .",
    "this fact makes it easy to study these decays in a model indepdent manner @xcite .",
    "the sm predictions for the @xmath32 at the @xmath33 scale are ( in the limit @xmath34 ) @xmath35 note that @xmath36 in the sm is suppressed compared to @xmath37 by @xmath38 , because @xmath39 boson couples only to the left - handed fermions .",
    "such terms proportional to @xmath40 will be neglected in our work by setting @xmath34 whenever they appear . on the other hand",
    ", this chirality suppression needs not be true in the presence of new physics such as left - right symmetric ( lr ) model or in a certain class of supersymmetric models with specific flavor symmetries . such new physics contributions can be parametrized in terms of four complex parameters , @xmath41 where @xmath42 are new complex numbers , whose phases parametrize the effects of the new sources of cp violation beyond the km phase in the sm .",
    "the sm case corresponds to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is convenient to define the ratio @xmath45 as following : @xmath46 in many interesting cases , this parameter @xmath45 is real @xcite as assumed in this work",
    ".    implications of new physics contributions to @xmath23 have been discussed by various group in conjunction with the possible solutions for the discrepancies between theoretical expectations and the data on the semileptonic branching ratio of and the missing charms in @xmath9 meson decays , and the unexpectedly large branching ratio for @xmath47 .",
    "it has been advocated that @xmath48 $ ] can solve these problems simultaneously @xcite . however",
    ", this claim is now being challenged by the new measurement @xmath49 cl ) @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we impose this new experimental data , rather than assume that the @xmath50 is large enough to solve the aformentioned puzzles in @xmath9 decays .",
    "in the presence of new physics contributions to @xmath13 , there should be also generic new physics contributions to @xmath51 through electromagnetic penguin diagrams .",

    "penguin contribution to @xmath0 is supressed relative to the photonic penguin by a factor of @xmath64 , and thus neglected in this work .",

    "iv , we will encounter examples for both @xmath67 and @xmath68 in general susy models with gluino - mediated flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) . in principle , there are many more dim-6 local operators that might contribute to @xmath0 @xcite . in the presence of so many new parameters ,",
    "it is difficult to figure out which operators are induced by new physics , since we are afforded only a few physical observables , such as @xmath69 and the tau polarization asymmetry @xmath70 in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it would be more meaningful to consider the simpler case before we take into account the most general case to figure out which operators are significantly affected by new physics .    up to now , we considered @xmath71 and @xmath72 relevant to @xmath73 , assuming new physics significantly contributes to @xmath1 and @xmath2 through dim-5 operators , eqs .",
    "( 2)(5 ) . in doing so",
    ", five more complex numbers ( @xmath74 ) have been introduced .",
    "if we further assume that the new physics does not induce new operators that are absent in the sm , we can drop @xmath75 by setting @xmath76 , thereby reducing the number of new parameters characterizing new physics effects into three complex numbers @xmath77 s ( or , equivalently @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "still the number of new parameters are larger than the physical observables at our disposal . however , in many interesting cases ( and especially susy models with gluino - mediated @xmath80 transition that is to be described in sec .",

    "therefore , we will assume that both @xmath45 and @xmath60 are real hereafter , and we are end up with 4 real parameters , which we choose to be @xmath81 and @xmath60 .",

    "our work is different from these previous works in a few aspects .",
    "first of all , we include the possibility that there is a new physics contribution to @xmath95 with a new cp violating phase ( i m @xmath96 ) .",
    "this necessarily calls for studying the direct cp violation in @xmath82 as advocated by kagan and neubert @xcite , and invalidates the most previous works on the model - independent determination of @xmath97 s .",
    "secondly we include the recent experimental constraint on @xmath98 , instead assuming that it can be large enough to solve the semileptonic branching ratio problem in @xmath9 decays .",
    "finally , we assume that the new physics does not introduce any new operators with chiralities different from those in the sm , and simply modifies the wilson coefficients of @xmath99 .",
    "thus our analysis does not consider the left - right symmetric extension of the sm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give basic formulae for the relevant physical observables such as @xmath93 , @xmath100 , etc . as functions of four real parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath60 . in sec .",

    "let us discuss the minimal sugra model with universal soft mass terms at gut scale , in which typical values of @xmath45 and @xmath60 are @xmath194 and @xmath195 respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the predictions in the minimal sugra model are very close to the dots in fig .",
    "[ fig_ch0 ] .",
    "namely , in the sugra case , there are two bands for the possible @xmath193 for a given @xmath93 , whereas in our case , @xmath193 can be anywhere in between becasue of the presence of a new cp - violating phase given by @xmath196 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_ch5 ] and [ fig_ch-5 ] , we show similar plots for @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "this choice of @xmath45 covers a large class of new physics as discussed in ref .",
    "implications of these figures are almost the same as fig .  1 , except that there is now rather strong constraint from @xmath85 ( e2 ) . in this case",
    "we can have larger direct cp violation in @xmath82 upto @xmath199 .",
    "also the ( e2 ) constraint removes substantial parts of available @xmath200 and @xmath201 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ch5 ] ( @xmath197 ) , compared to fig .",

    "[ fig_ch-5 ] ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath203 correlation is almost identical to the case with vanishing new phase @xmath204 . from figs .",
    "[ fig_ch0][fig_ch-5 ] , it is clear that the existence of a new cp violating phase not only can generate a large cp asymmetry in @xmath205 , but can it also induce quite a lot deviations of various observables in @xmath0 for @xmath206 and @xmath207 . for @xmath188 and @xmath197",

    "if the experimental data on @xmath212 and @xmath180 show large deviations from their sm values , it would indicate that @xmath45 and/or @xmath60 are complex , or some new physics contributes to @xmath128 ( with a possibly new cp violating phase ) , and/or even generates @xmath213 and possibly other dimension-6 @xmath214 operators with different chiralities from @xmath122 in the sm .",

    "this task will be possible , only after b factories accumulate the data for the first several years . or one might have to consider the modified @xmath128 and new operators that are not possible in the sm .",
    "in the previous section , we presented model - independent analysis of physics related with @xmath127 assuming there is a new cp - violating phase and both @xmath45 and @xmath60 are real . in this section , we wish to present specific models that satisfy such assumptions .",
    "let us consider the fcnc in generalized susy models , in which squark mass matrices are nondiagonal in the basis where fermion mass matrices are diagonal .",
    "in this case , there can be a potentially important contributions to the fcnc processes and cp violation that arise from flavor changing @xmath223 vertices @xcite .",
    "the sources of susy fcnc are the nondiagonal @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",

    "there are some models in the literature which fall into these two categories .",
    "as discussed below , the case ( i ) does not contribute to @xmath52 so that @xmath228 ( or , @xmath102 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the case ( ii ) contributes to @xmath52 as well as to @xmath65 and @xmath229 .",
    "also , there would be generically other contributions from @xmath230 and @xmath231 loops . if these loop effects are competent with the gluino - mediated loop effects we consider in the following , then our assumption that both @xmath45 and @xmath60 are real would not be true any longer . in the following , we assume that these ( susy ) electroweak loops are indeed negligible compared to the gluino mediated fcnc loop amplitudes .",
    "the latter is enhanced by @xmath232 , as usually assumed .",
    "however there is a suppression factor in the latter case , the mixing angle in the squark sector given by @xmath233 ( or , @xmath234 in the mass insertion approximation ) .",
    "also the heavy squark - gluino loops will be suppressed compared to the charged higgs - top , chargino - stop and neutralino - down squarks , unless all the susy particles have similar masses so that squark and gluinos are not too heavy .",
    "so one has to keep in mind that our assumption may break down for too small mixing angle in the squark sector or too heavy squark / gluino . with this caveat in mind , new physics contributions considered here depend on only one new phase so that @xmath45 and @xmath60 are real , as assumed in the previous section .",
    "in order to estimate the @xmath77 in the generalized susy models with gluino - mediated fcnc , we consider both the vertex mixing ( vm ) method and the mass insertion approximation ( mia ) .",
    "the latter approximation is good , when squarks are almost degenarate .",
    "the corresponding expressions can be obtained from the former expressions by taking a suitable expansion in @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is a suitable average mass of almost degenerate squarks .",
    "on the other hand , in the scenario in which the susy fcnc and susy cp problem are solved by decoupling of the ( nearly degenerate ) first two generation squarks such as in the effective susy models , there is a large hierarchy between the first two and the third squarks so that the mia is no longer a good approximation . in such case",

    "[ fig_conv ] ( a ) and the following paragraph ) .",
    "however if all the squarks ( including the third family squarks ) are heavier than @xmath294 tev , the motivation for the low energy susy is lost , since the fine tuning problem is reintroduced .",

    "the impact on @xmath193 is less striking than the @xmath273 case , but there is still a modest enhancement upto 1.44 of @xmath193 over its sm value which may be also detectable at b factories .",
    "one interesting feature of the @xmath226 mixing case is that the observables we show in figs .",
    "[ fig_lr03 ] and [ fig_lr08 ] can probe the effects of very heavy squark masses @xmath296 gev for @xmath297 .",

    ". however , this is just an artifact of our requirement @xmath298 tev , as described at the end of the previous paragraph .",
    "this is because we have fixed @xmath265 , since the heavier squark mass @xmath236 for a fixed @xmath265 implies the heavier gluino mass @xmath299 .",

    "the effect on @xmath193 is larger for the lighter squark mass as usual .",
    "next let us consider the case ( ii ) : @xmath227 insertion . in this case ,",
    "the susy breaking terms are the main source of the flavor changing @xmath227 mixing , which are not related with the yukawa couplings in principle .",
    "therefore , the mia may not be always valid , depending on the superparticle spectra .",
    "for example , a class of models @xcite,@xcite falls into this case where the @xmath227 mixing dominates .",
    "these models @xcite @xcite predict that @xmath256 mixing is order of @xmath303 .",
    "the mass spectra of the down - squarks in the model @xcite are nearly degenerate , whereas in the model @xcite only the @xmath304 , gauginos and the lightest neutral higgs are relatively light compared to @xmath305 tev .",
    "therefore , one can use the mia for the first models @xcite , whereas one has to use the vertex mixing for the second model @xcite .",
    "below , we will consider the mia case first . in the mass insertion approximation , @xmath306 in this case we consider two different choices for @xmath307 in order to compare our results with other existing literatures : @xmath308 @xcite and @xmath309 @xcite . as",

    "[ fig_px03 ] and [ fig_px1 ] ) .",

    "there would be some intrinsic theoretical uncertainties in such estimates of nonleptonic exclusive @xmath9 decays .",
    "on the contrary , the direct cp violation in @xmath29 can provide independent informations on @xmath307 with less theoretical uncertainties , since we are dealing with the inclusive decay rate .",
    "in any rate the observable @xmath210 can play an important role in probing a new cp violating phase in @xmath9 decays if the condition @xmath315 is met .",

    "only the third generation squarks are lighter than @xmath305 tev , and the 1st and the 2nd generation squarks simply decouple .",
    "therefore , we can keep only the third family squarks ( @xmath328 ) in the sum over the squark mass eigenstates , since others are all heavier than @xmath294 tev and/or the relations ( 40),(49 ) hold .",
    "after one imposes the experimental informations on @xmath93 and @xmath272 , one gets the allowed regions for @xmath275 and @xmath193 for a given phase @xmath270 , as shown in figs .",

    "only the third generation squarks are light , the strongest bound on the lighter stop comes from lep experiments @xcite , and @xmath334 gev is not excluded yet by lep experiment .",

    "however , this large @xmath210 quickly diminishes as @xmath338 gets heavier , and @xmath339 for @xmath340 gev .",

    "the @xmath227 insertion can generate a large direct cp violation in @xmath341 if there is a new cp violating phase associated with the squark mass matrix , @xmath342 , whereas there can be no significant change in @xmath193 compared with the sm case .",
    "also the deviation from the sm diminish very quickly as stop gets heavier . practically speaking",
    ", it would be impossible to notice the new physics effects if @xmath282 gev unless @xmath343 , for which new physics signal can be visible for heavier stop until @xmath344 gev if @xmath265 is not too large .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath226 mixing case , for which the new physics effects can increase @xmath193 up to 2.15 , and the @xmath210 can be as large as 11 @xmath335 for fairly large stop , @xmath345 gev and @xmath346 ( see fig .",
    "although @xmath210 and @xmath193 are not sensitive to the @xmath227 insertion for @xmath347 , there is another observable which is complementary to our observables : namely , cp violating lepton asymmetry in b decays discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for larger @xmath348 , direct cp violations in nonleptonic",
    "@xmath9 decays through @xmath349 penguin operators can provide additional informations @xcite .",
    "again , different channels are sensitive to different types of new physics , and it will be helpful to study as many modes as possible in order to find out new physics signals at b factories .",
    "in conclusion , we considered the possible new physics effects on the @xmath0 through the modified @xmath13 vertex .",
    "the cp violation in @xmath341 can be very different from the sm expectation ( @xmath350 ) , and the branching ratio and @xmath351 in @xmath0 can be affected by the new physics contributing to @xmath13 . in particular , the usual model - independent extraction of the wilson coefficients @xmath97 may be useless in the presence of new physics that modifies the @xmath32 with a new cp - violating phase ( namely , i m @xmath96 ) . therefore , not only is the cp asymmetry in @xmath341 a sensitive probe of new physics that might be discovered at @xmath8factories , but also it is indispensable for the model - independent analysis of @xmath0 . search for @xmath210 is clearly warranted at @xmath8factories .",
