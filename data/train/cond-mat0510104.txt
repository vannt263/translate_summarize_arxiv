    "we find that the @xmath0 order moments are independent on the multiplicative noise intensity . on the other hand the behavior of the @xmath1 order moments",
    "is strongly affected by the presence of a source of external noise .",
    "we find anticorrelated time behavior of the species densities .",
    "comparing our results with those obtained by calculating the same quantities within a coupled map lattice ( cml ) model  @xcite , we conclude that the anticorrelated oscillations of the species concentrations are strictly related to non - overlapping spatial patterns  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results could match data from a real ecosystem , whose dynamics is affected by the random variability of the environment , and could provide useful tools to predict behavior of biological species  @xcite .",
    "-0.2 cm our system is described by a time evolution model of lotka - volterra equations , within the ito scheme , with diffusive terms in a spatial lattice with @xmath2 sites @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote respectively the densities of species @xmath6 and species @xmath7 in the lattice site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the growth rate , @xmath10 is the diffusion constant , and @xmath11 indicates the sum over all the sites . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are statistically independent gaussian white noises with zero mean and unit variance , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the intensities of the multiplicative noise which models the interaction between the species and the environment , and @xmath16 is the interaction parameter .      -0.2 cm depending on the value of the interaction parameter , coexistence or exclusion regimes take place .",

    "these two regimes correspond to stable states of the lotka - volterra s deterministic model  @xcite .",
    "moreover periodical and random driving forces connected with environmental and climatic variables , such as the temperature , modify the dynamics of the ecosystem , affecting both directly the species densities and the interaction parameter .",

    "a bit less than @xmath39 , we observe a synchronization between the jumps and the periodicity of the rate @xmath20 .",
    "this synchronization phenomenon is due to the choice of the @xmath23 value , which stabilizes the jumps in such a way they happen for high values of the jump rate , that is for values around the maximum of the function @xmath20 .",
    "this causes a quasi - periodical time behavior of the species concentrations @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can be considered as a signature of the stochastic resonance phenomenon  @xcite in population dynamics  @xcite .",
