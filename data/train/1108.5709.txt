    "the common muon and proton apparatus for structure and spectroscopy ( compass )  @xcite is a fixed - target experiment at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "it is a two - stage high - resolution spectrometer that covers a wide range of scattering angles and particle momenta .",
    "the spectrometer is equipped with hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters so that final states with charged as well as neutral particles can be reconstructed .",
    "a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) in the first stage can be used for particle identification .",
    "it is able to separate kaons from pions up to momenta of 50  @xmath2 .",
    "the target is surrounded by a recoil proton detector ( rpd ) that measures the time of flight of the recoil protons using two scintillator barrels .",
    "compass is connected to the m2 beam line of the sps which can deliver secondary hadron beams with a momentum of up to 300  @xmath2  and a maximum intensity of  @xmath7 .",
    "the negative hadron beam that was used for the analyses presented here has a momentum of 190  @xmath2  and consists of 96.8  % @xmath3 , 2.4  % @xmath8 , and 0.8  % @xmath9  at the target .",
    "two cherenkov differential counters with achromatic ring focus ( cedar ) upstream of the target are used to identify the incoming beam particles .",
    "diffractive dissociation reactions are known to exhibit a rich spectrum of produced states . in these events",

    "is dominant .",
    "the @xmath10 then decays into a @xmath12-body final state .",
    "the process @xmath13 is characterized by two kinematic variables : the square of the total center - of - mass energy , @xmath14 , and the squared four - momentum transfer to the target , @xmath15 .",
    "it is customary to use the variable @xmath16 instead of @xmath11 , where @xmath17 is the minimum value of @xmath18 for a given invariant mass of @xmath10 .",
    "in a partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) of the pilot run data taken in 2004 , a significant spin - exotic @xmath19 resonance was found at around 1660  @xmath20  in @xmath21 final states produced in @xmath3  diffraction on a pb target at squared four - momentum transfers of @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the resonance parameters are consistent with the disputed @xmath23 claimed in this channel by other experiments  @xcite .    in 2008 compass",
    "has acquired large data sets of diffractive dissociation of 190  @xmath2  @xmath3  on a @xmath24h@xmath25 target . the trigger included a beam definition and the rpd , which ensured that the target proton stayed intact and also introduced a lower bound for @xmath26 of about 0.1  @xmath27 .",
    "events with charged particle trajectories outside the spectrometer acceptance and those , where the beam particle traversed the target unscattered , were vetoed . in the offline data selection events",
    "were required to have a well - defined primary interaction vertex inside the target volume .",
    "diffractive events were enriched by an exclusivity cut around the nominal beam energy . after all cuts the @xmath28  sample from the 2008 run contains  events .    in the pwa the isobar model  @xcite",
    "is used to decompose the decay @xmath29 into a chain of successive two - body decays .",

    "the spin - density matrix is determined by extended maximum likelihood fits performed in 20  @xmath20  wide bins of the three - pion invariant mass @xmath38 . in these fits no assumption is made on the produced resonances @xmath30 other than that their production strengths are constant within a @xmath38 bin .",

    "one expects that an isovector state should decay equally into charged and neutral @xmath0 states , if the decay proceeds via an isobar with isospin 1 , whereas for an isoscalar isobar the intensity in the neutral decay channel should be half of that in the charged one .",
