    "in 1985 , starting from the hylleraas functional @xcite and using the interelectronic distance @xmath0 as a correlation factor , kutzelnigg derived the seminal form of the mp2-r12 equations .",
    "@xcite this explicitly - correlated method ( more formally stated together with klopper in 1987 @xcite ) was later extended to higher level of theory and more accurate correlation factors @xmath1 , @xcite such as gaussian geminals @xmath2 or slater geminals @xmath3 the resulting `` f12 methods '' achieve chemical accuracy for small organic molecules with relatively small gaussian basis sets @xcite and are quickly becoming the first - choice method for high accuracy . @xcite    however , the inclusion of the correlation factor @xmath4 dredged up an old problem : in addition to two - electron integrals ( traditional ones and new ones ) , three - electron integrals over @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as well as four - electron integrals over @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 arise . except when one uses gaussian geminals , @xcite",
    "these integrals are not known analytically and , at that time , the only way to evaluate them would have been via expensive gauss - legendre quadratures .",
    "@xcite additionally , citing kutzelnigg and klopper , @xcite  _ even if fast procedures for the evaluation of these integrals were available , one would have to face the problem of the large number of these integrals ; while that of two - electron integrals is @xmath11 , there are @xmath12 three - electron and @xmath13 four - electron integrals .",
    "the storing and manipulating of these integrals could be handled only for extremely small basis sets . _ \"    undoubtedly , in the late 80 s , the two - electron integrals technology was still in development .",
    "@xcite nowadays , though still challenging , these integrals could be computed much more effectively via judicious recursive schemes , designing the quadrature only to the fundamental integrals .",
    "@xcite another important remark is that the actual number of _ significant _ ( i.e.  greater than a given threshold ) three- and four - electron integrals in a large system , is , at worst , @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "these kinds of scaling are achievable , for example , by exploiting robust density fitting @xcite or upper bound - based screening methods .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , the success of the r12 method was due to the decision of avoiding three- and four - electron integrals entirely through the insertion of the _ resolution of the identity _ ( ri ) @xcite @xmath16 in this way , three- and four - electron integrals are approximated as linear combinations of products of more conventional two - electron integrals .",
    "of course , the accuracy of the ri approximation relies entirely on the assumption that the auxiliary basis set is sufficiently large ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , in the general context of explicitly correlated methods , it is licit to ask : what is the suitable method evaluate three- and four - electron integrals ?",
    "it not clear to us that such method is ri .",
    "in fact , eschewing the ri approximation would offer at least two advantages : i ) smaller one - electron basis as the larger auxiliary basis set would not be required anymore ; ii ) the three- and four - electron integrals would be computed exactly .",
    "in a recent paper , @xcite we reported recurrence relations ( rrs ) to compute three - electron integrals over gaussian basis functions for multiplicative general operators of the form @xmath18 . here , we generalize our previous study to four - electron integrals .",

    "starting from this master operator , one can easily derive the rrs for various operators arising in explicitly - correlated methods following simple diagrammatic rules ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] ) .    here , we have derived three types of rrs : i ) starting from the fundamental integrals , vertical rrs ( vrrs ) allow to increase the angular momentum over the bra centers ; ii ) the transfer rr ( trr ) redistributes angular momentum between centers hosting different electrons , and can be used instead of the vrr on the last bra center ; iii ) the horizontal rrs ( hrrs ) enable to shift momentum from the bra to the ket centers corresponding to the same electronic coordinate .",
    "importantly , hrrs can be applied to contracted integrals .    finally , after carefully studying the different paths one can follow to build up angular momentum ( see fig .  [",
