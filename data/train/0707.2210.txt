    "the existence of @xmath0he trimers has also been demonstrated .",

    "@xcite measured a bond length of @xmath3  for @xmath0he@xmath1 , which indicates that this dimer is the largest known diatomic molecular ground state .",
    "based on this measurement they estimated a scattering length of @xmath4  and a dimer energy of @xmath5 mk @xcite .",
    "further investigations concerning @xmath0he trimers and tetramers have been reported in @xcite , but with no results on size and binding energies .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , we are not aware of any experimental results on binding energy and size of the asymmetric helium trimer consisting of two @xmath0he and one @xmath2he atoms .",
    "many theoretical calculations of the helium three - atomic systems were performed in the past for various interatomic potentials .",
    "variational , hyperspherical , and faddeev - type techniques have been employed in this context @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath0he trimer has two bound states of total angular momentum zero : a ground state of about @xmath6 mk and an excited state of about @xmath7 mk .",
    "experimentally this efimov - type excited state has not yet been observed .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the year 2006 is noticeable due the first convincing experimental evidence for the efimov effect in an ultracold gas of caesium atoms  @xcite .    due to the smaller mass of the @xmath2he atom ,",
    "the @xmath2he@xmath0he system is unbound .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath2he@xmath0he@xmath1 trimer exists , though with a binding energy of about 14 mk . in contrast to the symmetric case , there is no excited state in the asymmetric @xmath2he@xmath0he@xmath1 system .",
    "phase shifts of @xmath0he@xmath0he@xmath1 elastic scattering at ultra - low energies have been calculated for the first time in @xcite both below and above the three - body threshold .",
    "an alternative _ ab initio _ calculation was performed in @xcite , but only below the threshold .",
    "the only available results on the @xmath2he@xmath0he@xmath1 phase shifts were obtained in @xcite .",
    "for completeness we notice that zero - range models are able to reproduce the @xmath0he@xmath0he@xmath1 scattering situation @xcite .    in what follows we present our results on binding energies and scattering observables in the helium three - atomic systems obtained mainly with the lm2m2 potential by aziz and slaman @xcite .",
