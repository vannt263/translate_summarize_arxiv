    "it has been recognized that liquid helium is especially well suited for homogeneous cavitation studies . on the one hand , it can be prepared in a high - purity state , avoiding heterogeneous cavitation driven by impurities in the liquid .",
    "besides , experimental techniques have been developed @xcite that focus a short burst of ultrasound into a small volume of bulk liquid , thus preventing cavitation on defects at the walls of the experimental cell .",
    "on the other hand , helium remains liquid down to zero temperature ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this allows to address quantum cavitation , a phenomenon that may appear at very low temperatures.@xcite    heterogeneous cavitation produced by impurities purposely introduced in the liquid is also interesting by itself,@xcite and in a series of recent experiments the case of heterogeneous cavitation caused by electrons ( electron bubble explosions ) has been addressed in detail.@xcite another interesting case of heterogeneous cavitation in liquid @xmath0he thoroughly studied is that caused by the presence of quantized vortices acting as cavitation seeds.@xcite    in this work we attempt a theoretical description of electron bubble explosions using a @xmath2-dependent density functional approach we have employed in a series of studies on cavitation and nucleation in liquid helium ( see ref . for a comprehensive review ) in conjunction with a realistic electron - helium ( e - he ) effective potential .",
    "our results are in agreement with those obtained in refs . and for @xmath0he , and in ref . for @xmath1he , covering a wider temperature range .",

    "2 we present the results obtained using the capillary approximation . in the case of electron bubbles ,",
    "this approximation has been considered realistic enough to yield semi - quantitative results for critical pressures and thermal to quantum crossover temperatures , and constitutes a useful guide to the results obtained within density functional ( df ) theory . in sec .",
    "3 we present the df plus hartree electron - effective potential approach together with the results obtained for @xmath0he using this method . in sec .",

    "in this simple model , the electron is confined in an impenetrable spherical well potential of radius @xmath3 .",
    "the total energy of the e - he system can be written as a function of the radius as@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pressure applied to the system , @xmath6 is the surface tension of the liquid , and @xmath7 is its dielectric constant .",

    "when the liquid is depressed below its saturation vapor pressure , the absolute minimum becomes local , and @xmath17 also displays a local maximum .",
    "the metastability region in the @xmath18 plane extends between the liquid - vapor coexistence line down to the instability line .",
    "consequently , metastable bubbles can be formed at positive and negative pressures as well . in that region ,",

    "cavitating liquids undergo phase separation before they reach the stage of global unstability .",

    "we will show that for electron bubbles , the critical pressure @xmath30 at which it happens is very close to @xmath22 , a result already obtained in ref . .",
    "as a general rule , the presence of impurities in the liquid results in a sizeable decrease of @xmath31 . quantized vortices in liquid @xmath0he play the same role as impurities , and their presence also decrease @xmath31 ( refs . ) as well as the degree of critical supersaturation in @xmath1he-@xmath0he liquid mixtures.@xcite    within the capillary approximation , the dynamical evolution of the electron bubble can be parametrized by one single collective variable , namely the radius of the bubble . in this case , it is rather simple to describe quantum and thermal cavitation regimes on the same footing , continuously passing from one to the other .",
    "this is accomplished by the use of the functional integral method ( fim)@xcite thoroughly described in ref . .",
    "we now recall its essentials .",

    "thermal activation is no longer possible .",
    "however , cavitation may proceed by quantum tunnelling .",
    "the transition from one regime to the other is very abrupt , so that a thermal - to - quantum crossover temperature @xmath40 may be defined by indicating whether nucleation takes place thermally @xmath41 or quantically @xmath42 . in the limit of zero temperature ,",
    "cavitation is purely quantal , but for @xmath43 thermally assisted quantum cavitation is the physical process .",
