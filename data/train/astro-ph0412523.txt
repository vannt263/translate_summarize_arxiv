    "sx phoenicis stars ( sxps ) are the population ii short period pulsators , in most respects similar to much more numerous @xmath3 scuti stars , which are the population i objects .",
    "both types occupy the low luminosity end of the cepheid instability strip in the h - r diagram .",
    "it is not clear whether there are any systematic differences in pulsation properties between the two types .",
    "the incidence of high amplitude pulsation once seemed much higher among sxps but now , with improved cluster photometry , many low amplitude sxps are being detected ( pych et al .",
    "2001 , mazur et al .",
    "2003 , kaluzny & thompson 2003 , kaluzny et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "what makes sxps interesting in a wider context is that they are blue straggler stars ( bss ) found in a large number in globular and old open clusters .",
    "this means that they have unusual life history which is not well understood as it can not be explained in terms of the standard single star evolution scenario .",
    "the problem of bss origin is being debated for decades .",
    "historically , the first explanation was that the objects are products of evolution of the mass receiving component in close binary systems ( mccrea 1964 ) .",
    "later scenarios involving mergers of main sequence stars were mostly considered .",
    "the scenarios included mergers of primordial binaries after a gradual decrease of the orbit ( e.g. carney et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as direct stellar collisions in dense cluster cores ( e.g. lombardi et al .",
    "it is not clear how much imprints of the past evolution should be left in individual bss .",
    "this depends on the efficiency of chemical element and angular momentum mixing - the processes still poorly understood in stellar interior physics .",
    "understanding the origin and internal structure of bss is a challenging task for stellar evolution theory .",
    "the answer is of interest not only for this field but also for globular cluster research .",
    "as emphasized by lombardi & rasio ( 2002 ) , collisions and mergers of stars which lead to bss formation , play an important role in evolution of these systems .",
    "pulsation data on sxps are potential sources of accurate constraints on models of bss .",
    "each measured frequency of an identified oscillation mode is such a constraint .",
    "admittedly , mode identification is difficult unless we have evidence that the excited modes are radial .",
    "double mode radial pulsators seem quite frequent among sxps .",
    "the two accurately measured numbers yield strong constraints on stellar mass and heavy element content in the interior .",
    "data on nonradial mode frequencies could be even more interesting .",
    "in particular , determination of the frequency splitting provides certain mean value of the rotation rate in the interior .",
    "furthermore , there are nonradial modes whose frequencies are very sensitive to the extent of the element mixing beyond the convective core boundary",
    ". of great interest in the context of the debated bss origin is seeking evidence for presence of close companions manifesting themselves through cyclic period variations or tidally induced variability .",
    "what makes sxps interesting for stellar pulsation theory is the large diversity of their pulsation forms . in a relatively narrow period range ,",
    "extending from less than half to two hours , we encounter both the multimode low - amplitude pulsation , typical for main sequence dwarfs , and the monomode high - amplitude pulsation , typical for cepheids . according to linear nonadiabatic calculations",
    ", there are many unstable modes in sxps .",
    "however , finite amplitude development of the instability is not understood .",
    "this is the most outstanding unsolved problem of the theory .",
    "a sample of sxps with well constrained mean parameters may provide a key information what makes a star to become a dwarf- or a giant - type pulsator .",
    "the globular cluster @xmath2 centauri houses the largest number of sxps of all systems in our galaxy ( kaluzny et al . 2004 ) . having a large number of objects with well determined luminosities is an obvious advantage .",
    "the fact that the stars can not be assumed coeval and of the same chemical composition ( rey et al .",
    "2000 ) is a complicating factor .",
    "the cluster is atypical .",
    "data on sxps may prove useful in disentangling its evolution .    in the next section we survey observational data on all sxps in @xmath2 cen which includes frequency analysis . in section 3 we compare mean photometric parameters of sxps with the corresponding values calculated for standard evolutionary models .",
    "we also provide information on pulsation properties of these models based on the linear nonadiabatic analysis .",
    "section 4 is a star by star analysis of individual objects in which we compare their observational properties with theoretical models . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "@xmath2 centauri contains the most numerous population of variable stars among globular clusters of the galaxy ( clement et al .",
    "however until the mid 1990ies there was only one sx phe - type variable known in the field of the cluster .",
    "it was v65 , which in fact turned out later to be a foreground star",
    ". however , not much later kaluzny et al . ( 1996 , 1997 ) reported a discovery of 25 sxps , most of which must be members of the cluster .",
    "subsequent work done by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2004 ) increased the number of sxps in the field of @xmath2 centauri to 69 , making it the richest in these variables among all globular clusters of our galaxy .",
    "kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provide extensive photometry for 61 sxps collected during two years .",
    "this photometry contains from 532 to 755 @xmath4 and over 150 @xmath5 measurements for each variable .",
    "it is an excellent data base for analyzing multi - mode behavior and extracting information on physical properties of individual objects .",
    ".basic properties of sx phe - type variables in field of @xmath2 cen.[t1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition , @xmath2 cen is the first globular cluster for which the case project ( thompson et al . 2001 ) determined the distance .",
    "the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data for an eclipsing binary ogle gc17 yielded an apparent distance modulus of @xmath6 mag ( kaluzny et al .",
    "it is the most precise and reliable distance determination for this cluster and will be used in our work for calculating the absolute magnitudes of sxps belonging to @xmath2 cen .",
    "we will also use the mean color data dereddened with the color excess @xmath7 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis , 1998 ) to place individual objects in the h - r diagram .",
    "the full list of sxps located in the field of @xmath2 centauri containing main periods , amplitudes , mean magnitudes and colors is provided in table 1 .",
    "1 shows color - magnitude diagram around blue stragglers region of @xmath2 cen .",
    "points and open circles denote constant stars and sxps , respectively .",
    "not all stars in the sxps region are variables .",
    "this is hardly surprising , as we have the same situation in the @xmath3 scuti domain .",
    "presumably these apparently constant objects are very low amplitude pulsators .",
    "many sx phe stars exhibit multiple periods hence their analysis poses specific challenges .",
    "arguably the most advanced project in terms of both extent of its photometry and multitude of detected periods , the whole earth telescope ( wet ) , employed either the prewhitening _ or _ synthesis methods in their analysis ( kepler , 1993 ) . from the statistical point of view",
    "the two methods correspond to gauss - seidel ( g - s ) and newton - raphson ( n - r ) solutions of the least squares problem ( lsq ) .",
    "on one hand , a current astronomical practice favors the synthesis ( n - r ) method , employing the covariance matrix with large extra - diagonal coefficients .",
    "presence of close frequencies and/or their combinations in the synthesis method yields near singular normal equations and may produce large near cancelling terms in the solution , creating the @xmath8 problem and yielding solutions with excess amplitudes . on the other hand , the method recommended to deal with singularity in least squares fitting ( lsq ) is by means of the singular value decomposition ( svd , e.g. press et al . , 1986 ) .",
    "in the svd procedure the near singular terms of the covariance matrix are set small , resulting in choice of the solution with minimum norm ( minimum amplitudes in the present context ) .",
    "this resembles somewhat the prewhitening method , where implicitly all extra - diagonal terms are set zero ( gray & desikachary , 1973 ) .",
    "we are unaware of any paper comparing merits of the prewhitening and synthesis methods in rigid mathematical ( statistical ) terms .",
    "we employ the prewhitening and synthesis methods in parallel to analyze our sx phe light curves .",
    "we employed no more than 6 harmonics in prewhitening and in most cases just 2 or 3 harmonics for the @xmath9 mode and one harmonic for other modes .",
    "the values of ( fundamental ) frequencies were adjusted by nonlinear iterations , their harmonics / combinations were tied to the base frequencies .",
    "the resulting frequencies are listed in table 2 .",
    "the both methods yielded consistent frequencies for all strong detections , corresponding to the aov statistics @xmath10 .",
    "we observed no adverse effect of reappearance of the frequencies once prewhitened .",
    "ambiguity , if any , arose occasionally due to aliasing and it manifested with equal strength in both the prewhitening and synthesis methods .",
    "such cases are marked in table 2 with superscript @xmath11 .",
    "the novelty in our approach , as compared with wet , is in use of the multi - harmonic aov periodogram ( schwarzenberg - czerny , 1996 ) .",
    "it employs orthogonal functions and is able to combine power from harmonics ( nh=2 harmonics were combined in practice ) .",
    "importance of use of orthogonal functions in period search was argued by lomb ( 1976 ) , ferraz - mello ( 1981 ) , scargle ( 1982 ) and foster ( 1994 ) .",
    "advantage in combining harmonics is two - fold : they contribute extra power for the base frequency and at the same time reduce power in the residuals .",
    "any method sensitive to the harmonics ( e.g. phase folding and binning and the present case of fourier fit ) is prone to produce sub - harmonics in the periodogram .",
    "the subharmonic pose little problem in practice as they are easily identified by tight packing of aliases .",
    "there exist exact relations between power in the data , root - mean square ( rms ) of the residuals and the aov statistics @xmath12 employed in the present case ( e.g. schwarzenberg - czerny , 1999 ) .",
    "detection of frequencies poses special case of hypothesis testing in statistics . in our case",
    "the detection criterion @xmath13 roughly corresponded to mode amplitude exceeding 4 times its standard deviation @xmath14 .",
    "any frequencies near / below that detection limit are deemed unsafe and indicated with superscript @xmath15 in table 2 .",
    "the purpose of listing these marginal detections ( @xmath16 ) is solely to indicate deviations of residuals from pure noise and not to ponder on frequencies .",
    "an example of our results for nv324 is shown in fig .",
    "the panels show anova periodograms ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1996 ) .",
    "the uppermost panel is computed for the original data and reveals the dominant peak with its aliases .",
    "the remaining ones are computed for the data after subtraction of all so far identified frequencies and significant combinations of thereof .",
    "3 shows the light curves of nv324 associated with all six periods found .",
    "each light curve , phased with the particular period , was prewhitened with five remaining periods and their harmonics .",
    "note the asymmetry of the three upper light curves which is typical for pulsating stars .",
    "the window function is a concept associated with the power spectrum . strictly speaking it does not apply for the anova periodogram .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "2 numerous window - like structures are present around principal frequencies .",
    "we refrain here from discussion of amplitudes . on one",
    "hand theory results on amplitudes are unreliable ( sect .",
    "[ s4 ] ) . on",
    "the other hand lsq fits of multifrequency light curves often suffer from large correlation of parameters , indicating large error ellipses despite small variances .",
    "we address this problem only indirectly here by relying our analysis on a large sample of stars with very extensive coverage of observations .",
    "application of two independent reduction methods benefitted us in that we checked against any computation errors as well as gained insight into repeatability and reliability of our results .",

    "they could also arise as the result of mass exchange in binary systems .",
    "this possibility may be contemplated only in the case of very large mass loss on the lower red giant branch .",
    "applicable models would have rather low mass ( @xmath74 ) , most of which contained in the helium core .",
    "such models were once considered by dziembowski and kozowski ( 1974 ) for high amplitude @xmath3 scuti stars , called then dwarf cepheids .",
    "we found two cases of stars with long periodicities that may be interpreted as due to the tidally induced distortion .",
    "this could be an indirect evidence for binarity .",
    "possible implications for the mechanism of bss formation are interesting .",
    "therefore , the two objects deserve further studies to check the interpretation .",
    "this could be done by searching for induced pulsation period changes ( current data do not allow to reject nor confirm the proposal ) or by means of radial velocity measurements .",
    "our search for rotationally split triplets resulted in three plausible cases .",
    "for nv309 the inferred equatorial velocity would be about 60 km / s , and for nv317 it would be about 80 or 120 km / s , depending on three frequency peaks involved .",
    "for v197 the interpretation of all three close peaks as @xmath1 triplet results in equatorial rotational velocity of about 10 km / s .",
    "we found considerable diversity in pulsational behaviour ranging from that typical for main sequence @xmath3 scuti stars characterized by low amplitude and multimode variability to high amplitude cepheid - like monomode pulsations .",
    "this is quite amazing bearing in mind the fact that the spread in @xmath4 brightness is only about one magnitude . to give the picture of the observed diversity , fig .",
    "8 shows the phased light curves of the monoperiodic pulsators from our sample .",
    "examples of @xmath3 scuti - like behaviour are objects like v219 , nv294 , nv295 and nv296 . these are among the faintest and the hottest stars in our sample . amongst the faintest objects",
    "there are also some relatively high amplitude pulsators ( v198 , v249 and nv313 ) but all of them are suspected for being undermassive .",
    "the star v199 , whose light curve resembles those of cepheids or rr@xmath39 stars , is amongst most luminous objects .",
    "other high amplitude objects are multiperiodic . among them",
    "there are five classical double mode pulsators i.e. stars with fundamental and the first overtone excited .",
    "these objects were crucial for deriving constrains on masses and metallicities . in three of them we detected additional , apparently nonradial modes .",
    "coexistence of high amplitude radial modes with low amplitude nonradial modes was first seen by walraven , walraven and balona ( 1992 ) in the @xmath3 scuti star ai vel ( see also poretti 2003 ) . in some of our cases the nonradial modes",
    "are located close to radial modes in the frequency spectrum but not in all , just like in ai vel .",
    "three clean cases of spectra consisting of a dominant peak surrounded by close low amplitude peaks are v195 , v197 and nv321 .",
    "these are possible analogs of blazhko rr@xmath39 stars .",
    "we are thankful to dr .",
