    "whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) resonators play an important role in modern optics , with applications as laser cavities  @xcite , resonant filters  @xcite , optical switches  @xcite , and precision sensors  @xcite among other areas .",
    "they have been recently used for magnetometry  @xcite based on the ideas of cavity optomechanics@xcite .",
    "wgm resonator based optomechanical magnetometry combines the ultra - high optical transduction sensitivity of wgm resonators with the giant magnetostriction of materials such as terfenol - d , achieving high sensitivity while allowing room - temperature operation and simple optical readout .",
    "these advantages may enable applications in areas such as geophysical surveying  @xcite , tests of fundamental physics  @xcite , medical imaging  @xcite , and space exploration  @xcite .",
    "optomechanical magnetometers based on microscale on - chip wgm resonators have achieved 200 pt hz@xmath0 magnetic field sensitivity at megahertz frequencies  @xcite .",
    "however , due to a combination of noise sources at low frequency and poor low frequency mechanical response , magnetic field sensing in the hertz to kilohertz frequency range was only possible using inherent mechanical nonlinearities within the magnetostrictive material .",
    "this indirect approach caused a sacrifice in sensitivity to 110 nt hz@xmath0 .",
    "the hertz - kilohertz frequency range is crucial to many applications including , for instance , magnetic anomaly detection @xcite , geological surveying @xcite and magnetoencephalography @xcite .",
    "to enable highly sensitive magnetic field sensing in this regime , we have developed a centimeter - scale crystalline wgm resonator based magnetometer , which features reduced thermomechanical noise , lower frequency mechanical resonances , and higher optical quality factor than previously demonstrated optomechanical magnetometers . by embedding the magnetostrictive material ( terfenol - d ) within the wgm resonator , sub 10  nt  hz@xmath0 sensitivity was achieved over most of the frequency band from 127  hz to 600  khz , with a peak sensitivity of 131  pt  hz@xmath0 at 127  khz .",

    "the wgm resonator was fabricated using the ultra - precision machining facility at the australian national university , housing a moore nanotech 250 upl diamond turning lathe .",
    "wgm resonators are particularly well - suited for fabrication by diamond turning due to their cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we fabricated the resonator from caf@xmath2 due , primarily , to the previously demonstrated capability to achieve exceptionally high optical quality factors using this material  @xcite .",
    "the fabrication process of the magnetometer is shown in fig .",
    "[ resonator](a ) . a bulk of caf@xmath2 crystal , which was attached to a ceramic pedestal using a vacuum compatible epoxy glue ( epo - tex 353nd ) , was first rough - cut to form a wgm resonator with a diameter of 16  mm .",
    "lathing was also used to bore a void in the top of the crystal wgm structure .",
    "the void was machined to a diameter 30 @xmath1 m larger than the actual size of the disk of terfenol - d ( of diameter and thickness approximately 12  mm and 4  mm , respectively ) .",
    "the 15  @xmath1 m gap was the minimum that allowed the epoxy glue , due to its viscosity , to uniformly fill the interface of the two materials .",
    "next , we machined the final wgm structure with the radius of curvature of the resonator s rim of 1.616  mm  @xcite .",
    "the final step is to polish the resonator to achieve an extremely smooth surface , i.e. , a high intrinsic optical quality factor . using the lathe to rotate the wgm resonator and ensuring that the resonator is precisely centred on the rotational axis",
    ", polishing was accomplished using a polishing pad and diamond slurry . starting with 0.5  @xmath1 m particle size , large chips on the surface of the resonator left after cutting",
    "were removed and using progressively smaller particle sizes down to 0.05  @xmath1 m , the final polishing was achieved .",
    "the physical structure of the resonator is shown in fig .",

    "i.e. , it provided the magnetic field signal . to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the sensor , a large modulation was applied to the eom , transferring approximately half of the optical power into 13.6  mhz sidebands .",
    "it was found that only 40 @xmath1w of off - resonant light was required at the photoreceiver to resolve the noise of the optical field over the photoreceiver electronic noise floor .",
    "a coil with diameter of 6.5 cm and a total of 60 turns was positioned above the resonator , and used to generate the signal magnetic field to be detected .",
    "the strength of this field was calibrated using a commercial hall probe [ hirst gm04 ] .",

    "the structure in the system response is dominated by the three of mechanical eigenmodes of the device .",

    "[ result](b ) .",
    "note that the dispersive feature at the fundamental radial breathing mode resonance frequency ( @xmath20  khz ) results from interference of the response of that mode and the background response of the device .",
    "inspection of the measured error signal power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ result](a ) ) shows that the thermomechanical noise of all of these three mechanical eigenmodes is beneath the laser phase noise floor , indicating that the precision of magnetic field measurement with this device will be limited by laser noise rather than thermomechanical noise . above 140 khz ,",
    "the system response is suppressed with increasing frequency , with complex structure existing due to the presence of multifold higher frequency mechanical resonances .",
    "[ result](c ) shows the sensitivity measured over the frequency range from 127  hz to 600  khz .",
    "a peak sensitivity of 131  pt  hz@xmath0 is achieved at 126.75 khz , close to the eigenfrequencies of the mechanical crown and second order radial breathing modes , while similar sensitivity is also achievable at frequencies close to the fundamental radial breathing mode .",
    "evidently , the sensitivity is enhanced by these mechanical resonances , and outperforms previous cavity optomechanical magnetometers in the same frequency range by around three orders - of - magnitude .",
    "the best previously reported result had sensitivity above 130  nt  hz@xmath0 over the full range of the measurements we report here  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of our current device is limited by laser phase noise at frequencies below 540 khz and shot noise above that frequency .",
    "consequently , improved sensitivity could be achieved using phase stabilization  @xcite , increased optical power , or higher optical quality factors , until eventually the thermomechanical noise floor is reached  @xcite .",
    "quality factors as high as @xmath21 have been realized for millimeter - scale caf@xmath2 wgm resonator at 1550 nm and at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "our sensitivity therefore could be further enhanced by fabricating a higher @xmath22 resonator .",
    "the sensitivity could also be enhanced by engineering the structure of the device for improved overlap between the motion of mechanical eigenmodes and the stress applied by the terfenol - d  @xcite .",
    "estimates based on ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that sensitivities in the range of femtotesla may be obtainable with a full optimization .",
