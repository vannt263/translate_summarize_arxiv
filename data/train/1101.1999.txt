    "according to the deconfined - criticality scenario,@xcite in two dimensions , the phase transition separating the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) and antiferromagnetic phases is continuous ; naively,@xcite such a transition should be discontinuous , because the adjacent phases possess distinctive order parameters such as the vbs coverage pattern and the sublattice magnetization , respectively .",

    "the biquadratic interaction ( unlike the magnetic frustration ) is tractable with the quantum monte carlo method . the deconfined criticality is realized by tuning the spatial anisotropy.@xcite that is , as the interchain interaction increases , a transition from the vbs phase to either nematic or antiferromagnetic phase occurs.@xcite meanwhile , it turned out that the ring - exchange ( plaquette - four - spin ) interaction also induces the vbs phase even for @xmath7 . extensive monte carlo simulations@xcite support the deconfined - criticality scenario ; the results are compared with ours in sec .
