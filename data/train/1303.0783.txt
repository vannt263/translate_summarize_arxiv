    "picture1.eps    iopra changes the directionality , as well as randomizing the connections of the original network , without changing the degree of any node . hence ,",
    "if the initial network  is a random network , e.g. an erds - rnyi ( er ) network or a scale - free network generated by the configuration model , where the connections are originally laid at random , iopra changes only the directionality @xmath0 .",
    "however , if we apply iopra to  a nonrandom network , e.g. a lattice , the resulting network has not only a different directionality but also a more randomized structure .",
    "we start with  a bidirectional network @xmath49 , and use the link resetting algorithm ( lra ) to change the directionality ( see algorithm  [ lraalgo ] in appendix c ) .",
    "we randomly choose a fraction @xmath0 of the bidirectional link pairs from @xmath49 .",
    "then , we randomly choose only one unidirectional link from each bidirectional link , and randomly relocate the selected unidirectional links to a place without any link .",
    "in this work , we only apply lra to er networks . in this case , the in- and out - degree of the generated directed network follow the same binomial degree distribution  as the original network .",
    "however , the in - degree and out - degree of any node in the generated network  may differ from those in the original network @xmath49 . when lra is applied to other types of networks , such as the power - law networks , the original in- and out - degree distributions",
    "are destroyed , and tend to be binomial .    in summary ,",
    "two types of directed binomial networks can be generated : one is generated by iopra ( called the iopra directed binomial networks ) , whose nodes have the same in - degree and out - degree ; the other , created by lra ( called the lra directed binomial networks ) , has the same in- and out- degree distribution , while allowing the in- and out- degree of any node to be different .",
