    "an important goal of system biology is to understand the mechanisms that govern the protein regulatory dynamics .",
    "the so - called feedback loop is believed to be widely present in various eukaryotic cellular processes and regulates the gene expression of a broad class of intracellular proteins .",
    "it is usually understood that in the feedback loop transcription factors are regulatory proteins which activate transcription in eukaryotic cells ; they act by binding to a specific dna sequences in the nucleus , either activating or inhibiting the binding of rna polymerase to dna ; mrna is transcribed in the nucleus and is in turn translated in the cytoplasm .    in the practice of modeling the feedback loop , time delays in signaling pathways of regulatory processes",
    "are sometimes treated zero , or assumed to be a parameter which is varied to fit in experimental data in order to simulate the dynamics that can be generated .",
    "however , data fitting - in may not always satisfy all purposes of the investigations .",
    "for instance , a model may faithfully simulate the period of the oscillations but not the amplitude .",
    "moreover , regulatory signaling achieved through transportation of intracellular substances is closely related to the concentrations of mrna and the corresponding proteins , which means that the time delay in the signal pathway may be factually not a constant but a function dependent on the state of the regulatory network .",
    "it is then an interesting problem to investigate whether or not modeling the state - dependent time delay may achieve a more comprehensive description of the regulatory dynamics , extending the applicability of the current models for regulatory dynamics with constant time delays .    in this work , we begin with the prototype model for hes1 system and discuss how to model the diffusion time considering the effect of the fluctuation of concentrations of the substances in question which in turn leads to a model with state - dependent time delays .",
    "the next natural questions are how the model with state - dependent delays effect differ or improve from those with only constant delays , how the diffusion time is related to the fluctuation of the concentrations and , in particular , how the stability of the steady state and the bifurcated periodic oscillations depends on the state - dependent delay . in this paper",
    ", we answer these questions based on the model to be established .    we organize the remaining of the paper as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we model the diffusion time in regulatory dynamics and set up a prototype system of differential equations with state - dependent delay for the hes1 system . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we consider a general model with state - dependent delay and conduct linear stability analysis of the equivalent model and conduct a local hopf bifurcation analysis of the system using the multiple time scale method .",
    "numerical simulations on the model of hes1 system with state - dependent delay will be illustrated in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "we conclude the investigation at section  [ sect5 ] .",
    "in this section , we motivate the modeling of diffusion time delay with the hes1 regulatory system .",
    "hes1 is a protein which belongs to the basic helix - loop - helix ( bhlh , a protein structural motif ) family of transcription factors .",
    "it is a transcriptional repressor of genes that require a bhlh protein for their transcription . as a member of the bhlh family , it is a transcriptional repressor that influences cell proliferation and differentiation in embryogenesis .",
    "hes1 regulates its own expression via a negative feedback loop , and oscillates with approximately 2-hour periodicity @xcite .",
    "however , the molecular mechanism of such oscillation remains to be determined @xcite .",
    "mathematical modeling of hes1 regulatory system has been an active research area in the last decade .",

    "since mrna is typically transcribed in nucleus and then translated to cytoplasm for protein synthesis , there exists transcriptional and translational delays in the real reaction kinetics . for a better description of the intracellular processes , ( [ ode - hes1 ] )",
    "was extended into the following model of delay differential equation ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are transcriptional and translational delays , respectively .",
    "this model was able to simulate oscillatory solutions with the period and mrna expression lag in good agreement with some experimental data .",
    "the transcriptional and translational time delay are usually assumed to be constant and it is then a natural problem to model the time delays in order to investigate the effect of the varying time delays on genetic regulatory systems .    for simplicity , we combine the reaction or transcription time with the translation time between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and call the combination is the diffusion time which will be denoted by @xmath11 . in such a way @xmath9 in ( [ dde - hes1 ] ) is re - defined to be the mrna diffusion time and @xmath10 the protein diffusion time .",
    "that is , both are assumed to be the time for diffusion processes , and the termination of one diffusion process incurs that of the other .",
    "that is , we assume that    1 .   @xmath12 .",
    "now we drop the subscripts for the variables @xmath13 and @xmath10 in the following presentation , and turn to the modeling of the part of diffusion time due to spatial translation .",
    "let @xmath14 to be the time to homogenize a newly produced solute ( mrna or protein ) in the cell solvent , @xmath15 be the transcription time which will be assumed to be a constant . from fick",
    "s first law of diffusion , we know that the diffusion time for a newly produced solute to homogenize in a cell is not necessarily a constant but is dependent on the concentration gradient . to model the diffusion time delay ,",
    "let us suppose that we put a drop ( or subtract a drop ) of solute in a cup of solvent with concentration @xmath16 which has taken account of the new drop .",
    "the diffusion time @xmath14 to homogenize depends on the homogenized concentration @xmath17 of the solute in the cup without taking account of the new drop .",
    "therefore the diffusion time to homogenize the new drop depends on the concentration difference @xmath18 .",
    "the next problem is how @xmath14 depends on the concentration difference @xmath18 . in order to derive a reasonable modeling of @xmath11 ,",
    "we virtually assume that the directed distance of the central locations of concentrations @xmath16 and @xmath19 is @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is small .",
    "it is known that the diffusion time @xmath11 is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath21 ) and approximately satisfies @xmath22 .",
    "then by fick s first law we know that the diffusion flux ( @xmath23 ) is proportional to the existing concentration gradient under the assumption of steady state .",
    "namely , @xmath24 can be approximated by @xmath25 . to obtain an approximation of @xmath11",
    "we reduce @xmath21 from the aforementioned expressions of @xmath14 and @xmath24 .",
    "namely , @xmath26 can be approximated through @xmath27then we have @xmath28 . in the following ,",
    "we assume that    1 .",
    "there exist constants @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "namely , we assume that the diffusion time is linearly dependent on the fluctuation of the concentrations of mdna .",
    "moreover , if the concentrations are in their equilibrium states , the diffusion time becomes the transcriptional delay @xmath15 .",
    "note that before arriving at assumption ( a2 ) , we assumed a virtual distance @xmath20 in order to use fick s law while we have no intention to incorporate spatial information in the model .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion of spatial - temporal modeling of the hes1 and p53-mdm2 intracellular dynamics .",
    "we remark that such type of state - dependent delay has appeared in position control @xcite modeling the state - dependent traveling time of the echo , and in regenerative turning processes @xcite modeling the cutting time of one round of turning .",
    "now we obtain the following state - dependent delay differential equations , @xmath31 which provides another view on the models ( [ ode - hes1 ] ) and ( [ dde - hes1 ] ) : if we assume that the transcription and translation of the newly produced solute is instant , namely , @xmath32 , then we have model ( [ ode - hes1 ] ) which is a system of ordinary differential equation .",
    "if we assume that the transcription and translation of the newly produced solute needs a constant positive time , then we have model ( [ dde - hes1 ] ) which is a system of delay differential equation with constant delay .",
    "we should point out that our intention in this paper is to establish a model of genetic regulatory dynamics which can generalize the available models with constant delays while allowing the variability of the time delay .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that system with the state - dependent delay in the form of @xmath33 with @xmath34 being inhomogeneous linear can be transformed into models with both discrete and distributed delay which greatly facilitated the qualitative analysis of such type of models @xcite . in the next section",

    "starting from model ( [ sdde - general-1 ] ) of differential equations with threshold type state - dependent delay , we obtained model ( [ tranformed - general ] ) with constant delay equivalent to ( [ sdde - general-1 ] ) under assumptions ( b1 ) , ( b2 ) and ( b3 ) , by using a time domain transformation . system   ( [ tranformed - general ] ) provides a possibility to investigate the dynamics of the original system near the equilibrium points .",
