    "the aim of this work is to calculate an electron recombination rate with tungsten ions that are impurities in the fusion plasma .",
    "the current theoretical database for the rate coefficients from adas ( atomic data and analysis structure @xcite ) is not reliable .",
    "tungsten is a vital element for iter ( international thermonuclear experimental reactor ) and jet(joint european torus ) since it is used as plasma - facing material and for a divertor of the machine , which collects the heat produced by fusion plasma @xcite .",
    "thus some contamination of the core plasma by tungsten ions is unavoidable .",
    "detailed knowledge of the reaction rates of tungsten ions with electrons in plasma ( such as excitation , ionisation , and recombination ) is very important for the fusion plasma modelling and an efficient energy production from the fusion plasma .",
    "the problem with multiply charged tungsten ions and many other ions with several electrons in an open @xmath11-shell is that there is a very dense spectrum of chaotic multi - electronic compound resonances there which dominates the recombination rate .",
    "the interval between these resonances may be smaller than 10@xmath12  ev , and the total number of important configuration state functions ( csfs ) may reach billions @xcite . in these circumstances ,",
    "their mixing becomes chaotic and extremely sensitive to any unaccounted perturbation ( such as higher order correlation and quantum electrodynamics corrections )  @xcite .",
    "traditional approaches to the calculation based on the dielectronic recombination are not directly applicable here .",
    "instead , we must deal with the multi - electronic recombination .",
    "we have developed a consistent statistical theory  the many - body quantum chaos ( mbqc ) statistical theory  @xcite  in which the electron capture cross section into the multi - electronic resonances is expressed in terms of the dielectronic `` doorway '' resonances broadened by the coupling to the multi - electronic excitations .",
    "the recombination cross section is obtained as a product of this capture cross - section and the fluorescent yield for the multi - electronic compound states @xcite .",
    "the mbqc statistical theory predicts the results averaged over a small energy interval containing many compound resonances . due to the very dense spectrum of the compound resonances and finite experimental energy resolution",
    ", this averaging also happens in the experimental data .",
    "previously , we studied electron recombination in au@xmath10 using the statistical theory  @xcite .",
    "these works found that the measured @xmath13-fold enhancement of the recombination rate over the predicted direct radiative rate at low energies ( less than or about 1 ev ) @xcite is explained by the dense spectrum of compound resonances containing chaotic mixtures of many electron basis states .",
    "a similar enhancement was calculated for the recombination with w@xmath5  @xcite that is also in agreement with measurements at the heavy - ion storage ring  @xcite . in  @xcite we calculated the fluorescence yield in the same framework which enabled us to calculate the electron recombination rate over a larger electron energy range .",
    "finally , our most recent work in the series examined the electron capture cross section in the many - electron determinant basis and in the basis of configuration state functions with definite total electron angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "the result shows that both methods give nearly the same outcome for the electron capture via compound resonance states .    in this paper",
    "we apply our mbqc statistical theory to the problem of electron recombination with multiply charged tungsten ions with open @xmath11-shells . in sections  [ sec : spectrum ] and",
    "[ sec : statistical ] we summarize the theory , including specific details of relevance for these ions .",
    "electron recombination rates with w@xmath5 and nearby ions w@xmath3 and w@xmath4 have been measured and calculated in refs .",
    "comparison of our calculations with the experimental data from these papers is presented in sec .",

    "we also predict the electron recombination rates for the other ions w@xmath0 ( @xmath14  25 ) where experimental data are not available and future measurements may be prohibitively complicated or even impossible using present methods .",
    "these ions may have significant abundance in the plasma at certain temperatures ( about @xmath15 ev for w@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "finally we convolve the recombination cross sections with an isotropic maxwellian electron energy distribution to obtain thermally - averaged recombination rates for all eight ions for use in plasma modelling .",
    "these are presented in figures  [ fig : temrate1 ] and [ fig : temrate2 ] and are the main result of this work .",

    "that is , we include all spectroscopic orbitals with principal quantum number @xmath25 and orbital angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "this is sufficient for the calculation of the excitation spectrum near the ionization threshold of the compound ion w@xmath27 .",
    "the second step is to find a list of many - electron configurations for target and compound ions using this basis by distributing the electrons of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 shells among the 31 relativistic ( @xmath30 ) orbitals ( @xmath31  @xmath32 , @xmath33 ",

    "we very briefly present the main results in this section .",
    "the theoretical resonant recombination process @xcite may be depicted as follows : @xmath90 the first step of the process shows that the projectile electron is captured in a resonance state of the compound ion .",
    "the system is stabilized radiatively in the second step .",
    "the first step is reversible ( by the autoionization ) .    in the standard resonance theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the recombination cross section is a fraction of the total ( capture ) cross - section : @xmath91 .",
    "the factor @xmath92 is called the branching ratio or the fluorescence yield since the autoionization and the radiative decay compete with each other in the process ( [ eq : recombination ] ) .",
    "this factorization enables one to deal with the calculations of the capture cross - section and the fluorescence yield separately .",
    "note that values of @xmath92 may be different for different resonances , however in the statistical theory we actually calculate an energy - dependent average value of @xmath92 .      using the optical theorem expressing the total cross section via the forward scattering amplitude and ( [ eq : breit - wigner ] ) for the compound state wave functions , we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the summation over compound resonances may be replaced by the sum over dielectronic doorway states ( the basis components which are directly connected to the continuum by the coulomb interaction ) .",

    "note that according to ( [ eq : ccs ] ) the width of the dielectronic resonance is dominated by the spreading width @xmath106 which characterises an ` internal decay ' : i.e. the mixing of the dielecronic state with other several - excited - electron components of the compound state .",

    "@xcite significantly exceeds the autoionization and radiative widths . if necessary",

    "for w@xmath6 there are no published experimental data and we use @xmath179 ( ev)@xmath177 . we have also taken the average value @xmath179 for w@xmath4 since this seems natural for the ion between w@xmath3 and w@xmath5 . note that all rates obtained using these fits ( red short - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate1 ] ) are in agreement with our calculated rates ( black solid lines ) .",
    "finally , the plasma rate coefficient is calculated by convolution of the recombination cross section with an isotropic maxwellian electron energy distribution since the recombination process takes place in hot plasma @xcite .",
    "it can be calculated by taking integration of merged - beam electron recombination rate @xmath180 as @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the plasma electron temperature . in this work",
    "we have performed the calculation starting from 1 ev to 240 ev in 1  ev energy steps . in one of our previous works  @xcite",
    "we have shown that for small energies ( less than 1 ev ) our theory recovers the enhancement in the measured recombination rate .",
    "therefore , we have extrapolated our result for the rate to the energy interval of @xmath183 ev without calculation , just to estimate the contribution of energies below 1 ev to the integral .",
    "we have not done this extrapolation for other ions instead they are taken constant in less than 1 ev .",
    "this is acceptable since a significant abundance of highly charged tungsten ions in plasma appears at temperatures above 100 ev , where the energy integration interval of @xmath183 ev is not important .",
