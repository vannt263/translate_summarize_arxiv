    "whilst a rather detailed description of the vulcanization transition has emerged over the past few years within the context of a mean - field approximation  @xcite , the picture of this transition beyond the mean - field level is less certain .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide a description of the vulcanization transition beyond the mean - field approximation via the application of renormalization group ( rg ) ideas to a model that incorporates both the quenched randomness ( central to systems undergoing the vulcanization transition ) and the thermal fluctuations of the constituents ( whose change in character is the fundamental hallmark of the transition ) .",
    "our aim is to shed some light on certain universal properties of the vulcanization transition within the framework of the well - controlled and systematically improvable approximation scheme that the rg provides , viz .",
    ", an expansion about an upper critical dimension that we shall see takes the value six .",
    "we remind the reader that the vulcanization transition is an equilibrium phase transition from a liquid state of matter to an amorphous solid state .",
    "( in addition to the technical reports cited above  @xcite , we refer the reader to some informal accounts of the physics of the vulcanization transition  @xcite . )",
    "the transition occurs when a sufficient density of permanent random constraints ( e.g.  chemical crosslinks)the quenched randomness ",
    "are introduced to connect the constituents ( e.g.  macromolecules ) , whose locations are the thermally fluctuating variables . in the resulting amorphous solid state ,",
    "the thermal motion of ( at least a fraction of ) the constituents of the liquid undergo a qualitative change : no longer wandering throughout the container , they are instead localized in space at random positions about which they execute thermal ( i.e.  brownian ) motion characterized by random r.m.s",
    ".  displacements .",
    "our approach to the vulcanization transition is based on a minimal landau - wilson effective hamiltonian that describes the energetics of various order - parameter - field configurations , the order parameter in question having been crafted to detect and diagnose amorphous solidification .",
    "this order parameter and effective hamiltonian can be derived ( along with specific values for the coefficients of the terms in the effective hamiltonian ) via the application of replica statistical mechanics to a specific semi - microscopic model of randomly crosslinked macromolecular systems ( rcmss ) , viz . , the deam - edwards model  @xcite ; this procedure is described in detail in ref .",
    "more generally , the form of the minimal model can be determined from the nature of the order parameter , especially its transformation properties and certain symmetries that the effective hamiltonian need possess , along with the assumptions of the analyticity of the effective hamiltonian and the continuity of the transition .",
    "this system - nonspecific strategy for determining the minimal model was applied in ref .",
    "there , it was shown that by regarding the effective hamiltonian as a landau free energy one could recover from it the mean - field description of both the liquid and emergent amorphous solid states known earlier from the analysis of various semi - microscopic models  @xcite . the mean - field value of order parameter in the solid state",
    "encodes a function rather than a number , and it possesses a certain mean - field universality ,  by which we mean that ( as the transition is approached from the amorphous solid side ) both the exponent governing the vanishing of the fraction of constituents localized ( i.e.  the gel fraction ) and the scaled distribution of localization lengths of the localized constituents turn out to depend not on the coefficients in the landau free energy but only on its qualitative structure . support for this mean - field picture of the amorphous solid state ,",
    "in the form of results for the localized fraction and scaled distribution of localization lengths , has emerged from extensive molecular dynamics computer simulations of three - dimensional , off - lattice , interacting , macromolecular systems , due to barsky and plischke  @xcite . in order to provide a unified theory of the vulcanization transition that encompasses the liquid , critical and random solid states , we shall in the present work",
    "be adopting this landau free energy as the appropriate landau - wilson effective hamiltonian .",
    "we shall be focusing on the liquid and critical states , rather than the amorphous solid state , and shall therefore be concerned with the order - parameter correlator rather than its mean value . along the way , we shall therefore discuss the physical content of this correlator , why it signals the approaching amorphous solid state , and how it gives rise to an associated susceptibility whose divergence mark the vulcanization transition .",
    "given the apparent precision of the picture of the amorphous solid state resulting from the mean - field approximation  @xcite , the reader may question the wisdom of our embarking on program that seeks to go beyond the mean - field approximation by incorporating the effects of fluctuations .",
    "we therefore now pause to explain what has motivated this program .",
    "( i )  below six spatial dimensions , mean - field theory necessarily breaks down sufficiently close to the vulcanization transition .",
    "although , as we shall also see , the region of crosslink densities within which fluctuations play an important role is narrower for dimensions closer to ( but below ) six and for longer macromolecules , it is by no means necessary for this region to be narrow for shorter macromolecules and for lower - dimensional systems ; thus , systems for which the fluctuation - dominated regime is observably wide certainly exist .",
    "( ii )  whilst there have been many successful treatments of critical phenomena beyond the mean - field approximation in systems with quenched randomness , these have , by and large , been for systems in which the emergent order was not of the essentially random type under consideration here or in the spin glass setting  @xcite .",
    "instead the emergent order has typically been of the type arising in pure systems , albeit perturbed by the quenched disorder .",
    "we are motivated here by the challenge of going beyond mean - field theory in the context of a transition to a structurally random state of matter .",
    "( iii )  the vulcanization transition has often been addressed from the perspective of gelation / percolation theories  @xcite . whilst this perspective can be ( and certainly has been ) taken beyond the mean - field level , it possesses but a _ single _ ensemble , and therefore does not incorporate the effects of _ both _ quenched randomness and thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "given that an essential aspect of the vulcanization transition is the impact of the quenched random constraints on the thermal motion of the constituents , the _ a priori _ identification of the vulcanization transition with gelation / percolation is thus a nontrivial matter .",
    "by contrast with the gelation / percolation - type of approaches , the analysis given in the present paper applies directly to the vulcanization transition exhibited by thermally fluctuating systems and driven by quenched random constraints .",
    "it should therefore shed some light on the relevance of the gelation / percolation - type perspective for the vulcanization transition , as we shall discuss in sec .",

    "we begin by examining the self - consistency of mean - field theory by estimating the impact of fluctuations perturbatively , which results in the construction of a ginzburg criterion and the identification of six as being the appropriate upper critical dimension .",

    "all these elements have been discussed in detail elsewhere , and we shall therefore be brief . as the reader will see , although its construction follows a quite conventional path , the theory does possess some intricacies .",
    "we shall therefore take various opportunities to shed some light on the physical meaning of its various ingredients .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "how does this potts field theory compare the vulcanization field theory that we have been analyzing in the present paper ?",
    "the potts field theory has , a cubic interaction , as does the vulcanization field theory , and therefore its upper critical dimension is also six . if we examine the rg analysis of the potts field theory ( in an expansion around six dimensions )  @xcite we see that , at the one - loop level , diagrams identical in form ( i.e.  those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : renorm ] ) enter the renormalization of the various vertices .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath62 limit the rg flow equations for the two theories turn out to be identical .",
    "this striking result is connected to the following observations : ( i )  in potts case , aside from the @xmath7-dimensional integrals corresponding to the diagrams , the coefficients in the flow equations are determined by the contractions of potts - tensor indices associated with each cubic vertex , these contractions being the origin of the @xmath58-dependence of the coefficients in the flow equations .",

    "( [ eq : rg_cons_sum_3+],[eq : ftwoint ] ) ] .",
    "( iii )  despite the explicit differences in the forms of the two theories , it turns out that , in the @xmath62 limit , the integrals and the combinatorics conspire to produce precisely the same flow equations . in some delicate way , which we do not fully understand , the constraints on the wavevector summations in the vulcanization theory play a similar role to the field - index contractions in the potts theory .",
    "having discussed the similarities of the potts and vulcanization approaches , let us now catalogue the many distinctions between them : ( i )  the potts field theory has a multiplet of @xmath58 real fields on @xmath7-dimensional space ; the vulcanization field theory has a real singlet field living on @xmath54-fold replicated @xmath7-dimensional space .",
    "( ii )   the potts field theory represents a setting involving a _ single _",
    "ensemble  @xcite , the ensemble of percolation configurations , whereas the vulcanization field theory describes a physical problem in which _ two _ distinct ensembles ( thermal and disorder ) play essential roles . as such , the vulcanization field theory is capable of providing a unified theory not only of the transition but also of the structure , correlations and ( e.g.  elastic ) response of the emerging amorphous solid state .",
    "this is already manifested at the mean - field level , inasmuch as the vulcanization field theory presents an order parameter that is far richer in its physical content that the one presented by the potts model .",
    "( iii )  the entire symmetry structures possessed by the percolation and vulcanization field theories are quite different .",
    "the potts field theory has translational and rotational invariance ( in unreplicated space ) , along with the discrete symmetry of @xmath54-fold permutations of the field components .",
    "the vulcanization field theory has the symmetries of the independent translations and rotations of the @xmath54 replicas of space , along with the discrete symmetry of @xmath54-fold permutations amongst the replicas .",
    "( iv )  the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking at the percolation and vulcanization phase transitions is distinct .",
    "the percolation transition ( in its potts representation ) involves the spontaneous breaking of the ( @xmath62 limit ) of a _ discrete _ @xmath54-fold permutation symmetry .",
    "by contrast , the vulcanization transition involves the spontaneous breaking of the ( @xmath62 limit of the ) _ continuous _ symmetry of relative translations and rotations of the @xmath25 replicas ; the permutation symmetry remains intact in the amorphous solid state , as does the symmetry of common translations and rotations of replicated space .",

    ", fluctuations destroy the percolation transition only at and below the the lower critical dimension of unity .",
    "whilst there are these apparent distinctions between the percolation and vulcanization approaches , especially in low dimensions , there is also evidence in favor of some sort of sharp correspondence between the physics of percolation and vulcanization coming from the computation of critical exponents near the upper critical dimension .",
    "this apparent dichotomy can , however , be reconciled if we carefully delineate between three logically distinct physical properties pertaining to rcmss and other randomly constrained systems : ( i )  macroscopic network formation ( by which we mean that constraints are present in sufficient density to connect a nonzero fraction of the constituents into a giant random molecule ) ; ( ii )  random localization ( by which we mean the change in thermal motion of a nonzero fraction of the constituents from wandering throughout the container to fluctuating only over finite distances from their random mean positions ) ; and ( iii )  the acquisition of rigidity ( by which we mean the emergence of a nonzero static shear modulus ) . within mean - field theory ( and",
    "hence above six spatial dimensions ) , these three properties go hand in hand , emerging simultaneously at the phase transition . at and below six dimensions",
    "they appear to continue to go hand in hand ( although , strictly speaking , we have not yet investigated the issue of the acquisition of rigidity beyond mean - field theory )  until one reaches two dimensions where we believe this broad picture will change ( as we shall discuss shortly ) .",
    "thus , it appears that , within the limited sphere of issues concerning amorphous solidification that percolation - based approaches are capable of addressing , such approaches do not lead one astray . in other words ,",
    "the superposition of thermal fluctuations on the positions of the constituents of the macroscopic network that emerges as the constraint density is increased towards the phase transition does not lead to any changes in the critical exponents governing percolation - type quantities : disorder fluctuations appear to play a more important role than do thermal fluctuations , as far as the percolative aspects of the critical phenomenon are concerned .",
    "this brings up the interesting issue of the nature of the vulcanization transition and its relationship with the percolation transition as the dimensionality of space is reduced to the neighborhood of two spatial dimensions , two being the lower critical dimension of the vulcanization transition .",
    "( the ideas reported in this paragraph result from an ongoing collaboration with h.  e.  castillo  @xcite . )  indeed , the case of two dimensions is especially fascinating in view of the fact that there is a conventional percolation transition in two dimensions , whereas the thermal fluctuations are expected to be sufficiently prominent to destablize the amorphous solid phase , in which case the macroscopic network formation no longer occurs simultaneously with the random localization of constituents of the network .",
    "it is tempting to speculate  @xcite that in two dimensions an anomalous type of vulcanization transition ( not accompanied by true localization ) continues to happen simultaneously with percolation transition .",
    "as the constraint density is tuned from below to above criticality , the amorphous solidification order parameter would remain zero , whereas the order - parameter correlations would change from decaying exponentially to decaying algebraically with distance .",
    "one might say that ( constraint - density controlled ) cluster fragmentation ( rather than the thermal excitation of lattice defects , as in regular two - dimensional melting ) would be mediating the melting transition .",
    "if this scenario should happen to be borne out then , at sufficiently high crosslink densities one would have a quasi - amorphous solid state  the random analogue of a two - dimensional solid  @xcite  exhibiting quasi - long - range positional order but of a random rather than regular type . by implementing these ideas via an effective field theory that describes low - energy excitations of the amorphous solid state ,",
    "we hope to construct a picture of the vulcanization transition and the emergent rigid state in and near two spatial dimensions .",
    "such a development would complement the approach to the vulcanization transition , presented here , which is based on expanding about the upper critical dimension , e.g. , by providing access to critical exponents via an expansion about two rather than six dimensions .",
