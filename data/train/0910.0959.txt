    "the @xmath0 production is commonly accepted as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma formed in high energy nuclear collisions . the @xmath0 elliptic flow which is sensitive to the early space - time evolution of the colliding system carries dynamic information on the new state of matter , if it is formed in the early stage .",
    "since the recently observed @xmath0 elliptic flow at rhic energy  @xcite is with large uncertainty and can not differentiate from various @xmath0 production mechanisms , it needs more precise experimental and theoretical studies .    the charm quark number in the partonic phase increases with the colliding nuclear energy .",
    "when the energy is high enough , the coalescence of those uncorrelated charm quarks becomes a significant source for @xmath0 production .",
    "the @xmath0 regeneration and its competition with the primordial @xmath0 production have been discussed in different models  @xcite . to calculate the fractions of",
    "the initially produced and regenerated @xmath0s for the nuclear modification factor and transverse momentum distribution , we set up the charmonium transport equations  @xcite with both gain ( regeneration ) and lose ( suppression ) terms in the partonic phase . in this paper , we calculate the @xmath0 elliptic flow in nuclear collisions at sps , rhic and lhc energies in the frame of the transport model .",
    "taking the fact that charmonia are heavy particles , the distribution function @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in transverse phase space at mid - rapidity can be described by a boltzmann equation  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the charmonium transverse momentum , transverse coordinate , invariant time and impact parameter , @xmath8 is the charmonium transverse velocity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are dissociation and regeneration rate calculated from the gluon dissociation process @xmath11 and the reverse process . from the large single electron elliptic flow measured at rhic  @xcite , charm quarks",
    "are supposed to be kinetically thermalized in the hot medium .",
    "the temperature , baryon chemical potential and medium velocity appeared in the gluon and charm quark thermal distributions are determined from the 2 + 1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamics . solving the coupled transport equation for @xmath0 and the hydrodynamic equations for the space - time evolution of the partonic phase , one can obtain the @xmath0 distribution function @xmath12 and in turn the nuclear modification factor @xmath13 and the averaged transverse momentum square  @xcite .",
    "the initially produced charmonia from nucleon - nucleon hard processes carry high momentum , and the gluon multi - scattering effect before the two gluons fuse into a charmonium leads to a further transverse momentum broadening  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the high @xmath14 @xmath0s in the final state are dominated by the initial production . on the other hand , the thermalized charm quarks in the hot medium",
    "satisfy the thermal distribution , and the regenerated charmonia are with low momentum and thus dominate the @xmath0 production at low @xmath14 region .",
    "the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows the fractions of initially produced and regenerated @xmath0s as functions of @xmath14 for central pb+pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "it is easy to see that the low @xmath14 region is governed by regeneration and the high @xmath14 region is characterized by initial production .",
    "the elliptic flow @xmath15 describes the asymmetric degree of the particle momentum in transverse space , @xmath16 . at sps energy",
    ", there are only few charm quarks produced at the initial stage of the collisions .",
    "therefore , the regeneration can be safely neglected . in this case , the initial production controls the system , and the non - thermalized @xmath0s can not feel the collective flow of the thermalized medium .",
    "the only source for the @xmath0 elliptic flow is the leakage effect described by the free streaming term on the left hand side of the transport equation ( [ transport ] ) : @xmath0s with high @xmath14 are easier to escape the hot medium in the direction where the fireball is thinner .",
    "therefore , the final state @xmath0s are no longer isotropic and leads to finite value of @xmath15 . however ,",
    "due to the expansion of the fireball , the asymmetry in geometry decreases with time , and the elliptic flow due to such geometry configuration is very small in comparison with the collective effect .",
    "we show on the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] the elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at impact parameter @xmath17 fm . at sps ,",
    "the elliptic flow is extremely small due to the lack of regeneration .",
    "the fraction of regeneration for @xmath0 increases with centrality monotonously . at rhic ,",
    "the regeneration becomes important and its contribution to the total @xmath0s is even around @xmath18 in central au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , for semi - central collisions where the elliptic flow reaches the maximum , the system is still controlled by the initial production and the @xmath0 elliptic flow is still very weak , as showed in the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the situation at lhc is very different .",
    "the formed fireball is much larger , hotter and longer lived , almost all the initially produced @xmath0s at low and intermediate momentum are eaten up by the medium , and the @xmath0 production with @xmath19 gev is dominated by the regeneration , see the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] . in this case",
    "the @xmath0s from the recombination of thermalized charm quarks carry large elliptic flow , and the maximum value at about @xmath20 gev reaches @xmath21 .",
    "we have assumed charm quark thermalization at any @xmath14 , the elliptic flow from the regeneration thus increases monotonously with @xmath14 .",
    "while this is not true at high @xmath14 , it does not change the full @xmath15 remarkably , since the high @xmath14 region is dominated by the initial production .",
    "note that the shape of the @xmath22 is quite different from what observed for light quark hadrons  @xcite which is saturated at high @xmath14 .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath0 elliptic flow at lhc is expected to be much larger than that at sps and rhic , due to the dominance of the regeneration mechanism and the full thermalization of charm quarks .",
