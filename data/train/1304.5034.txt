    "wireless cellular networks offer nowadays possibility to watch tv on mobile devices , which is an example of a real - time content streaming .",
    "this type of traffic demand is expected to increase significantly in the future . in order to cope with this process ,",
    "network operators need to implement in their dimensioning tools efficient methods allowing to predict the quality of this type of service .",
    "the quality of real - time streaming ( rts ) is principally related to the number and duration of _ outage incidents _  ( hopefully short ) periods when the network can not deliver to a given user in real - time the requested content of the required quality . in this paper",
    "we propose a stochastic model allowing for an analytic evaluation of such metrics .",
    "it assumes a traffic demand with different radio conditions of calls , and can be specified to take into account the parameters of a given wireless cellular technology .",
    "we develop expressions for several important performance characteristics of this model , including the mean time spent in outage and the mean number of outage incidents for a typical streaming call in function of its radio conditions .",
    "these expressions involve only stationary probabilities of the ( free ) traffic demand process , which is a vector of independent poisson random variables describing the number of users in different radio conditions .",
    "we use this model to analyze rts in a typical cell of a 3gpp long term evolution ( lte ) cellular network assuming orthogonal intra - cell user channels with the peak bit - rates ( achievable when there are no other users in the same cell ) close to the theoretical shannon s bound in the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , with the extra - cell interference treated as noise .",
    "these assumptions lead to a radio resource constraint in a multi - rate linear form .",
    "namely , each user experiencing a given signal - to-(extra - cell)-interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) requires a fixed fraction of the normalized radio capacity , related to the ratio between its requested and peak bit - rates .",
    "all users of a given configuration ( experiencing different sinr values ) can be entirely satisfied if and only if the total required capacity is not larger than one .    in the above context of a multi - rate linear radio resource constraint , we analyse some natural parametric class of _ least - effort - served - first _ ( lesf ) service policies , which assign service to users in order of their increasing radio capacity demand , until the full capacity ( possibly with some margin ) is reached .",
    "the capacity margin may be used to offer some `` lower quality '' service to users temporarily in outage thus realizing some type of fairness with respect to unequal user radio - channel conditions .",
    "this class contains an optimal and a fair policy , the latter being suggested by lte implementations .    in order to evaluate explicitly the quality of service metrics induced by the lesf policies we relate the mean time spent in outage and the mean number of outage incidents for a typical streaming call in given radio conditions to the distribution functions of some linear functionals of the poisson vector describing the steady state of the system .",
    "we calculate the fourier transforms of these functions and use a well - known fourier transform inversion method to obtain numerical values of the quantities of interest .",
    "we also study the mean throughput during a typical streaming call evaluating the expectations of the corresponding non - linear functionals of the poisson vector describing the steady state of the system via the monte carlo method .    using this approach",
    ", we present a thorough study of the quality of rts with lesf policies in the aforementioned markovian setting . for completeness",
    "we present also some pure - simulation results illustrating the impact of a non poisson - arrival assumption .",
    "let us now recollect a few _ related works _ on the performance evaluation of cellular networks .",
    "in early 80 s , wireless cellular networks were carrying essentially voice calls , which require constant bit - rates ( cbr ) and are subject to admission control policies with blocking ( at the arrival epoch ) to guarantee these rates for calls already in service .",
    "an important amount of work has been done to propose efficient call admission policies  @xcite",
    ". policies with admission conditions in the multi - rate linear form have been considered e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "progressively , cellular networks started carrying also calls with variable bit - rates ( vbr ) , used to transmit data files .",
    "the available resources are ( fairly ) shared between such calls and when the traffic demand increases , the file transfer delays increase as well , but ( in principle ) no call is ever blocked .",
    "these delays may be evaluated analytically using multi - rate linear resource constraint in conjunction with multi - class processor sharing models ; cf e.g.  @xcite .",
    "recently , users may access multimedia streaming services through their mobile devices  @xcite .",
    "they are provided via cbr connections , essentially without admission control , but they tolerate temporary interruptions , when network congestions occur .",
    "one may distinguish two types of streaming traffic . in _",
    "real - time streaming ( rts ) _ ( as e.g. in mobile tv ) , considered in this paper , the portions of the streaming content emitted during the time when the transmission to a given user is interrupted ( is in outage ) are definitely lost for him ( unless a `` secondary '' , lower - rate streaming is provided during these periods ) . in _",
    "non - real - time streaming ( nrts ) _ ( like e.g. , video - on - demand , youtube , dailymotion , etc ) , a user starts playing back the requested multimedia content after some initial delay , required to deliver and buffer on the user device some initial portion of it . if further transmission is interrupted for some time making the user buffer content drop to zero ( buffer starvation ) then the play - back is stopped until some new required portion of the content is delivered .",
    "several papers study the effect of the variability of the wireless channel on the performance of a single streaming call ; see for e.g.  @xcite , @xcite . in  @xcite vbr transmissions and rts",
    "are considered jointly in some analytical model , however the number and duration of outage periods are not evaluated . in @xcite the tradeoff between the start - up delay and the probability of buffer starvation is analyzed in a markovian queuing framework for nrts streaming .",
    "we do not consider any cell - load balancing ; see  @xcite for some recent work on this problem in the video streaming context .",
    "also , @xcite consider some admission control policies to guarantee non - dropping of multimedia calls due to caller impatience and/or handoffs .    _",
    "the remaining part of this paper _ is organized as follows . in section  [ s.wireless ]",
    "we will present our model for the evaluation of the quality of rts in wireless cellular networks .",
    "technical proofs of the results presented in this section are postponed to the appendix , where they are given in a more general context .",
    "section  [ s.numerical ] specifies our model to be compliant with the lte cellular networks specification and presents numerical results regarding the quality of rts in these networks .",
    "in this section we present a new stochastic model of rts in cellular networks .",
    "we consider the following scenario of multi - user streaming in a cellular network .",
    "geographically distributed users wish to obtain down - link wireless streaming of some ( typically video ) content , contacting base stations of a network at random times , for random durations , requesting some fixed streaming bit - rates .",
    "we consider a uni - cast traffic ( as opposed to the broadcast or multi - cast case ) , i.e. ; the content is delivered to all users via private connections .",
    "different classes of users ( calls ) need to be distinguished , regarding their radio channel conditions , requested streaming bit - rates and mean streaming times .",
    "each user chooses one base station , the one with the smallest path - loss , independently of the configuration of users served by this station .",
    "thus , we do not consider any load - balancing policy .",
    "if a given base station can not serve all the users present at a given time , it temporarily stops streaming the requested content at the requested rate to users of some classes , according to some given policy ( to be described ) , which is supposed to preserve a maximal subset of served users .",
    "we call these ( classes of ) users with the requested bit - rate temporarily denied _ in outage_. the users in outage will not receive the part of the content which is emitted during their outage times ( this is the principle of the rts )",
    ". we will also consider policies , which offer some `` best - effort '' streaming bit - rates for some classes of users in outage , thus allowing for example to keep receiving the requested content but of a lower quality .",
    "users , which are ( temporarily ) denied even this lower quality of service are called _ in deep outage_.      in this paper we assume that users are connected to the serving antennas via orthogonal single - input - single - output ( siso ) channels allowing for the peak - rate close to the theoretical shannon s bound in the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) model , with the ( extra - cell ) interference treated as noise .",
    "we will also comment on how to model multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) and broadcast channels .",
    "the quality of channel of a given user depends on the path - loss of the signal with respect to its serving base station , a constant noise , and the interference from other ( non - serving ) base stations .",
    "these three components determine its signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "both path - loss form the serving station and interference account for the distance and random propagation effects ( shadowing ) .",
    "our main motivation for considering a multi - class model is to distinguish users with different sinr values . in other words ,",
    "even if we assume that all users require the same streaming times and rates , we still need a multi - class model due to ( typically ) different sinr s values of users in wireless cellular networks",
    ".      we will present and analytically evaluate performance of some ( realistic ) streaming policies in the context described above",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the following characteristics :    * fraction of time spent in outage and in deep outage during the typical call of a given class , * number of outage incidents occurring during this call , * mean throughput ( average bit - rate ) during such call , accounting for the requested bit - rates and for the `` best - effort '' bit - rate obtained during the outage periods .      in what follows we describe a mathematical model of the rts that is an incarnation of a new , more general , stochastic service model with capacity sharing and interruptions presented and analyzed in the appendix  [ s.model ] .",
    "this is a single server model which allows to study the performance of one tagged base station of a multi - cellular network satisfying the above system assumptions .",
    "more details on how this model fits the multi - cell scenario will be presented in section  [ s.numerical ] .",

    "different classes of calls are independent from each other .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the number of calls of a given class requesting streaming from a given bs at time @xmath9 ; see section  [ s.userslocations ] in the appendix for a formal definitions of these variables in terms of arrival process and service times .",

    "we call @xmath16 the _ traffic demand _ ( per base station ) of class @xmath17 .",
    "users are supposed to be offered the requested streaming rates for the whole requested streaming times . however , due to limited wireless resources , for some configuration of users @xmath12 , the requested streaming rates @xmath18 may be not achievable . following the assumption of orthogonal awgn siso wireless channels ( with the ( extra - cell ) interference treated as noise ) available for users of a given station , we assume that the requested rates are achievable for all calls present at time @xmath9 if @xmath19 for some non - negative vector @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the maximal ( peak ) bit - rate of a user of class @xmath17 , whose channel conditions are characterized by @xmath2 .",

    "we can interpret the ratio between the requested and maximal bit - rates @xmath31 as the _ resource demand _ of a user of class @xmath17 .",
    "note that the configuration of users @xmath12 can be entirely served if and only if the total resource demand satisfies the constraint @xmath32 this is a _ multi - rate linear resource constraint_.      if the requested streaming rates are not achievable for a given configuration of users @xmath12 present at time @xmath9 , then some classes of users will be temporarily put in outage at time @xmath9 , meaning that they will receive some smaller bit - rates ( whose values are not guaranteed and may depend on the configuration @xmath12 ) .",
    "these smaller , `` best - effort '' bit - rates may drop to 0 , in which case we say that users are in deep - outage .",
    "let us recall that the times at which users are in outage and deep outage do _ not _ alter the original streaming times ; i.e. the streaming content is not buffered , nor delayed during the outage periods .",
    "we will define now a parametric family of service polices for which _ classes with smaller resource demands have higher service priority_. in this regard , in the remaining part of the paper we assume ( without loss of generality ) that the resource demands of users from different classes are ordered @xmath33 .",

    "[ r.lesf ] the lesf@xmath42 policy is _ optimal _ in the following sense : given constraint  ( [ e.merlang ] ) and the assumption that the classes with smaller resource demands have higher priority , this policy allows to serve the maximal subset of users present in the system . for the same reason any lesf@xmath43 policy with @xmath44 is clearly sub - optimal . in order to explain the motivation for considering such policies",
    ", one needs to extend the model and explain what actually happens with classes of users which experience outage . in this regard , note that @xmath45 is the actual fraction of the server capacity consumed by the users which are not in outage .",
    "the remaining server capacity @xmath46 ( which is not needed to serve users in classes @xmath47 ) can be used to offer some `` lower quality '' service ( e.g. streaming with lower video resolution , etc ) to the users in classes @xmath48 which are in outage . note by  ( [ e.lesf ] ) that the remaining server capacity under the policy lesf@xmath43 is at least @xmath49 hence , the server accepting the class @xmath50 as the least - priority class being `` fully '' served , leaves enough remaining capacity to be able to make the same effort ( allocate service capacity @xmath51 ) for all users in outage in classes whose service demand exceeds @xmath52 by no more than @xmath53 .",
