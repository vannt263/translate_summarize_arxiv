    "the best fit value of @xmath149 is still consistent with that obtained in section  [ sec : fit ] ( @xmath150 ) within @xmath151 error but its uncertainty ( @xmath152 ) is large .",
    "compared with the constraints on @xmath128 obtained for the single power - law @xmath153 relation , the larger uncertainty of @xmath7 obtained here is mainly because the relative larger uncertainties in the slope of the broken power - law @xmath153 relation adopted here lead to larger uncertainties in the estimations of the mbh mass densities compared with that for the single power - law @xmath3 relation adopted above .",
    "the @xmath8 obtained here ( @xmath154 ) is also substantially smaller than that obtained for the single power - law @xmath3 relation , mainly because of the relatively higher zero - point of the broken power - law given by @xcite .    in the analysis in section  [ sec",
    ": fit ] , we also adopt the single power - law form for the @xmath4 relation given by @xcite , which is largely consistent with those estimated by others ( see references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite updated the @xmath4 relation and found that this relation for the barred galaxies may be different from that for those non - barred galaxies / ellipticals .",
    "if assuming that the @xmath4 relation is the same as that for ellipticals at @xmath155 [ i.e. , @xmath156 with an intrinsic scatter of 0.29 ] and the same as that for the barred galaxies at @xmath157 [ i.e. , @xmath158 with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath159 ; see table  2 in @xcite ] , we find @xmath160 .",
    "the constraint obtained here for @xmath7 is substantially different from that obtained in section  [ sec : fit ] , which suggests a significant negative evolution of the velocity dispersion of individual big galaxies , i.e. , the velocity dispersions of big galaxies decrease by @xmath161 , which is marginally compatible with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario as recently proposed by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the @xmath8 obtained here is slightly higher than that obtained above for a single power - law @xmath4 relation , which is mainly due to the smaller intrinsic scatter of the adopted @xmath162 relation and the smaller normalization for the relation at @xmath163 .",
    "both of those factors lead to slightly smaller mbh mass densities in all the redshift bins and hence slightly higher @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper , we study the cosmic evolution of the @xmath3 relation and the @xmath4 relation by a global method , independent of individual mbh mass estimates .",
    "we have estimated the cosmic evolution of mbh mass densities over the redshift range of @xmath6 .",
    "the mbh mass densities are estimated from both the smfs / vdfs of normal galaxies determined by recent observations using the @xmath3 and @xmath4 relations , and the agn x - ray lfs according to the simple @xcite argument . by matching the mbh densities estimated from the normal galaxies with that from the agn x - ray lfs",
    ", we obtain global constraints on the evolution of the @xmath3 relation and the @xmath4 relation .",
    "we find that the @xmath3 relation evolves with redshift positively , i.e. , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , though the significance level is not high ; however , a @xmath7 larger than @xmath118 is excluded at the @xmath119 level .",
    "we also find that the @xmath4 relation appears not to positively evolve with redshift ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "our results suggest that the mbh mass growth precedes the bulge mass growth but the galaxy velocity dispersion does not increase with the mass growth of the bulge after the quench of nuclear activity , which is roughly consistent with the two - phase galaxy formation scenario proposed by @xcite in which a galaxy roughly double its masses after @xmath12 due to accretion and minor mergers while its velocity dispersion drops slightly .",
