    "in recent time , the nature of power laws and spheres of their use became of interest in applications  @xcite . for real networks",
    "one has proposed several models describing the occurrence of the power law ; the most known one is the preferential attachment model  @xcite . in linguistics , mechanisms of the occurrence of zipf and heaps laws",
    "were thoroughly studied in the time of b.  mandelbrot  @xcite .",
    "papers containing empirical studies and mathematical models also appear regularly nowadays ( see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein ; for the mathematical motivation of this paper see  @xcite ) . however , there are no commonly accepted explanations of the fact that in reality with some values of parameters the power law does not adequately describe processes under consideration  @xcite . here",
    "we try to answer this question , considering probabilities of the occurrence of various trajectories in a homogeneous markov chain .",

    "usually one describes frequencies of words occurrences with the help of a power law asymptotics  @xcite . but note that the power law is irrelevant in hieroglyphic scripts @xcite .    as the initial model explaining the power law of decrease of frequencies of occurrences of english words we consider the model of the word generation process consisting in the sequential independent random addition of various symbols ( letters and the space ) , each of which has a fixed probability ( the monkey model ) .",
    "this model has a long history , but the power character of the asymptotics of the sorted list of word frequencies has been strictly justified for it only recently  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study one natural generalization of this model , namely , the model with the markov connection of neighboring symbols .",
    "such model was studied by b.  mandelbrot  @xcite ; however , he has mainly considered a particular case of the occurrence of the power asymptotics .",
    "as appeared , in dependence of the matrix of transition probabilities , the ordered list of frequencies of all possible trajectories of a markov chain can have essentially different asymptotics .",
    "thus , let us consider a homogeneous markov chain with discrete time and with a finite set of states @xmath0 such that @xmath5 ( see @xcite for the terminology and equivalent statements given below ) .",

    "in this paper we prove that in a typical case the asymptotics of the function @xmath3 has a power character , and define its exponent from the matrix of transition probabilities .",
    "if this matrix is block - diagonal , then with some specific values of transition probabilities the power asymptotics gets ( logarithmic ) addends .",
    "but if this matrix is rather sparse , then probabilities quickly decrease ; namely , the rate of asymptotics is greater than that of the power one , but not greater than that of the exponential one .",
    "we also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential order of decrease and obtain a formula for determining the exponent from the transition probability matrix and the initial distribution vector .",
