    "the actual formation scenario for the supermassive bhs is still not certain @xcite .",

    "@xmath10 ) of the bhs in the globular clusters @xcite . at present the object of the intermediate mass range has not been directly found yet .",

    "nowadays , we can produce a dynamic bh by computer .",
    "we have two representative scenarios for forming a dynamic bh promptly . here",
    "we neglect accretion , since the standard timescale for this process is considerably longer than the dynamical one .",
    "the first one is the merger of equal mass , binary bhs .",
    "based on the current numerical simulations of the binary bhs , there may exist an upper spin limit for the newly formed bh .",
    "the binary composed of non - spinning individual bhs leads to the final maximum spin of the newly formed bh of @xmath13 ( @xmath3 is the angular momentum and @xmath4 the gravitational mass of the newly formed bh ) @xcite , while the spinning individual bhs in arbitrary direction leads to a final bh spin of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , test particle approximation in bh perturbation approach including the superradiance effect leads to a final bh spin of @xmath15 @xcite . in theory , we have the following discussion to support the existence of the upper spin limit of the newly formed bh .",
    "if the plunge phase of the binary bhs is characterised by the physical quantities at a certain separation radius , namely the isco ( innermost stable circular orbit ) of a newly formed bh , then there may exist an upper limit to the spin of the newly formed bh because most likely there exist a radially unstable condition at the isco under which the binary begins to collide and form a new bh .",
    "the next one is gravitational collapse of a uniformly rotating relativistic star . in this scenario , the maximum spin of the bh exists by the following discussion .",
    "first , a star contracts itself to the mass shedding limit , conserving the angular momentum of the system .",
    "then , so far as the system contains sufficient angular momentum , the star evolves along the mass shedding sequence quasi - stationary , releasing the mass and angular momentum .",
    "once the star reaches the critical onset of collapse because of relativistic gravitation , it begins to collapse @xcite . from the collapse of a uniformly rotating supermassive star , the final spin of a newly formed bh is around @xmath16 @xcite .

    ", we are in these decades able to extract fruitful features of bhs in the frequency band of @xmath17  @xmath18 .",
    "potential sources of high signal to noise events in this frequency range are quasi - periodic waves arising from nonaxisymmetric bars in collapsing relativistic stars and from the inspiral of binary bhs for example ( e.g.  ref .",

    "the weyl scalar @xmath135 contains both outgoing waves and back - scattered waves by the curvature when we measure the quantity in finite radius from the centre . in order to focus on the outgoing waves , we monitor the waveform at three different locations , and investigate all of them .",
    "since all three locations are considered as radiation zone of gravitational waves from the source , the gravitational field of all three locations is weak , and back - scattered waves only play a secondary role .",

    "we adjust the time axis of all three waveforms by assuming that gravitational waves propagate with the speed of light , and plot them in the same panel in figs .",
    "[ fig : gw1comp ] and [ fig : gw2comp ] .",
    "in fact , we use the following relation @xmath136 to adjust the time .",
    "although there is some difference in the magnitude of the amplitude , the global features look the same . investigating all three waveforms , we find that the outgoing waves contain three features .",
    "the first is that there appears a burst wave as the collapse goes on .",
    "the second is that once the bh forms , there is a damping wave which corresponds to a characteristic oscillation of the dynamic bh .",
    "the third is that there is a continuous wave after the damping one .    in order to identify the cause of continuous waves after the ringdown",
    ", we first investigate the azimuthal modes of the rest mass density .",

    "we investigate @xmath139 and @xmath91 diagnostics at 4 different radii for models i and ii in figs .",
    "[ fig : md1rm1 ]  [ fig : md2rm2 ] . although the saturation amplitude for different radii is different for each @xmath140 diagnostic , we find the following features .",
    "the azimuthal diagnostics begin to amplify efficiently after the apparent horizon has appeared in the hypersurface .",
    "this feature raises a question as to whether the amplification of the azimuthal diagnostics is directly connected with the configuration of the bh .",
    "the saturation amplitude of each @xmath140 diagnostics is quite similar at the same radius .",
    "the saturation amplitude decreases as the radius becomes far from the bh .",
    "this feature suggests that the matter which is very close to the bh may play a key role for generating the quasi - periodic waveform after the ringdown .",
    "next , we investigate the bh configuration to identify a possible cause of the continuous waves .",
    "we compute @xmath115-pole moment of the ricci scalar @xmath141 and the imaginary part of the weyl curvature @xmath101 on the apparent horizon throughout the evolution .",
    "we also compute @xmath115-pole moment of the same scalar curvatures using the configuration of a kerr bh .",
    "we use the area of the horizon and the nondimensional kerr parameter @xmath142 for computing @xmath115-pole moment .",
    "then , we compare each @xmath115-pole in both dimensional definition with the bh area in figs .",
    "[ fig : mm1ra ]  [ fig : mm2ia ] , and nondimensional one in figs .",
    "[ fig : mm1r ]  [ fig : mm2i ] .",
    "we find the following two features .",
    "the first is that after @xmath143 time from the formation of the dynamic bh , it is described as a kerr bh is within a relative error of several percents .",
    "if we take the dimension of @xmath115-poles into account through the area of the bh , @xmath115-pole of the dynamic bh approaches the one of a kerr in figs .",
    "[ fig : mm1ra ] and [ fig : mm1ia ] after @xmath144 , and in figs .",
    "[ fig : mm2ra ] and [ fig : mm2ia ] after @xmath145 .",
    "therefore the bh configuration becomes nearly the same as a kerr after @xmath146 from the bh formation .",
    "this statement suggests that the cause of continuous waves may be related to the matter instability , since the bh configuration is nearly the same as a kerr .",
    "the other is that the odd @xmath115-pole moment has large deviation from that of a kerr .",
    "this may be accepted fact as the nonaxisymmetric configuration of the rotating bh , as it traces the violent phenomenon at the bh formation .",
    "one caution from this feature is that the bh mass and angular momentum are settled down after @xmath143 from the bh formation time ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : mj1 ] and [ fig : mj2 ] ) , that the bh is almost regarded as a kerr .",
    "for example , the half - life period of the bh oscillation @xmath147 is @xmath148 , since the quasinormal mode frequency of a kerr bh of @xmath149 is @xmath150 for @xmath151 , @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "the fact leads to the conclusion that we can not extract the `` stationary '' mass and angular momentum of the dynamic bh by quasinormal ringing in principle .",
    "those ringing waves represent vibration of a transient dynamic bh , not a `` stationary '' one .",
    "we investigate the formation of the dynamic bh through gravitational collapse by means of three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in general relativity .",
    "we particularly focus on the configuration of a dynamic bh and find the following two features .",
    "we investigate two different definitions for the angular momentum of a dynamic bh in order to check the validity of the approximated killing vector approach .",
    "we compare two results from two different definitions for the angular momentum and find that we are able to extract precisely the bh mass and angular momentum even if we use the approximated killing vector .",
    "the fact also indicates that our cases of gravitational collapse are very close to axisymmetric .",
    "we also demonstrate the method to extract @xmath115-pole moment of the dynamic bh precisely without using the approximated killing vector .",
    "this finding opens a new field of investigating the bh itself by extracting the properties of @xmath115-poles of the curvatures on the horizon .",
    "we compare the configuration of the dynamic bh with that of the kerr , using multipole moment of the curvatures on the horizon .",
    "we find , as a result , that the quasistationary stage of the newly formed bh is approximately described by a kerr bh .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the whole spacetime is approximately represented by a kerr , since we only investigate the trapped surface of the horizon , just a local structure of the whole spacetime .",
