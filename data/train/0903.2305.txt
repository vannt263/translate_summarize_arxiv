    "the spin - hall effects ( she ) are a family of phenomena in condensed matter systems in which an applied longitudinal electric field gives rise to a transverse spin current .",
    "the spin current arises from the transverse separation of spin species in the system , and the physics driving the separation mechanism can be rather distinct across different systems .",
    "the earliest prediction of transverse spin separation was made by dyakonov and perel in the 1970s,@xcite who studied the spin - dependent scattering mechanisms of carriers with localized impurities .",
    "the class of she s which occur as a result of the spin - orbit interaction of carriers with impurities are referred to in the literature as _ extrinsic_. conversely , there are _ intrinsic _ forms of the she , which have become an active field of research in more recent years,@xcite following two seminal papers : the first by murakami _",
    "et al . _  which predicts a she of holes in @xmath0-doped semiconductors described in the luttinger model,@xcite and the other by sinova",
    "_ et al . _  in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) formed in semiconductor heterostructures with rashba spin - orbit coupling.@xcite both effects are finite in the absence of disorder , and are characterized by a pure transverse spin current generated from the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the band structure of the system .",
    "previous studies@xcite have shown that the she described in ref .",
    "[ ] for infinite rashba systems vanishes when one includes vertex corrections to model the effects of impurity scattering .",
    "however , the effect may still be manifested in finite - sized systems@xcite such as in mesoscopically confined 2degs [ ] ( e.g.  in quasi one - dimensional quantum wires ) , or in the presence of magnetic impurities.@xcite in this work , we will analyze the she in rashba systems without considering vertex corrections ( i.e.  in line with the original treatment in ref .   [ ] ) .",
    "instead , we will provide a phenomenological explanation of the vanishing she based on our own analysis later in the paper .",
    "in constrast , the she in the luttinger hole system is robust to vertex corrections.@xcite + it is intriguing that the two she s in refs .  [ ] and [ ] , although both intrinsic in nature , appear to originate from distinct mechanisms . the former effect in ref .",
    "[ ] is an adiabatic effect described via a gauge potential which arises from the relaxation of hole spins to an effective magnetic field in momentum @xmath1 space .",
    "the topological berry curvature@xcite of the gauge potential has the physical significance of a magnetic field in momentum space , and affects the trajectory of carriers in much the same way as a classical magnetic field does in real space .",
    "here , the resulting magnetic lorentz force in momentum space manifests itself as an additional ( anomalous ) velocity in real space .",
    "the semiclassical equations of motion of carriers in the presence of the berry curvature have been derived previously,@xcite and will be revisited for the luttinger system in this article .",
    "it is found that the real space trajectory of holes along the transverse direction is spin - dependent , thus resulting in a finite she .",
    "the she in rashba systems,@xcite on the other hand , was derived originally from a semiclassical analysis of electron spin dynamics in a rashba 2deg system , with no apparent relation to the @xmath2-space topology . in the analysis,@xcite electrons",
    "were found to gain a momentum - dependent out - of - plane spin polarization in the presence of rashba soc and an external electric field , leading to a transverse separation of spins .",
    "it is often stated in the literature that the effect arises from the @xmath2-anisotropic precession of spins.@xcite as part of the motivation for this paper , we will clarify the mechanism and show that the effect is in fact an adiabatic effect in which spins become aligned to momentum - dependent effective magnetic fields .    from a heuristic viewpoint , the physical mechanism of the two she s [ ] are clearly distinct : in the former , carriers acquire a spin - dependent anomalous velocity , whilst in the latter they acquire a momentum - dependent spin - polarization . our motivation for this paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we ask whether the she in rashba systems can also be formulated within an adiabatic framework , and , secondly , whether the physical mechanisms of the two she s can be unified . in order to describe the rashba",
    "she under an adiabatic formulation , it is instructive to make note of several points : ( 1 ) the adiabatic berry curvature of momentum space of the rashba system vanishes except as a @xmath3-function singularity at @xmath4.@xcite therefore , the spin - dependent anomalous velocity in the rashba system vanishes for electrons with @xmath5 and thus does not contribute any transverse spin current .",
    "in contrast , the spin - hall current in the luttinger system results from the dirac monopole curvature @xmath6 of momentum space , ( 2 ) in the rashba she , spins become tilted out - of - plane which appears contradictory to the adiabatic regime whereby they are assumed to follow perfectly the in - plane rashba field , and ( 3 ) although the berry curvature in the rashba system exists only at a singular point in @xmath2-space , the resulting berry phase is finite , and previous studies have shown that the spin - hall conductivity in the rashba system is related to the berry phase through the kubo formula.@xcite    in this article , we find that the above remarks ( 1)-(3 ) can be consolidated into a consistent adiabatic theory that emerges from a consideration of the explicit time - dependence of she systems",
    ". in particular , a gauge field @xmath7 naturally appears in time space upon applying a unitary transformation to the system , which has the physical significance of a magnetic field in the transformed system .",
    "this magnetic field couples to the electron spin , and is shown to precisely account for the she in the rashba system in the adiabatic limit ; here , this limit amounts to the spins following the direction of the _ sum _ of the rashba field and the new effective field . furthermore , the berry phase can be equivalently expressed in terms of the adiabatic components of the gauge field @xmath7 .",
    "thus , a gauge field description can be attributed to both intrinsic she s , although their respective gauge fields are defined in different spaces ( momentum and time ) .",
    "having identified that both intrinsic she s arise from gauge fields in the adiabatic limit , we finally embark on the problem of unifying the physical origin of the two effects . in the presence of an external electric field ,",
    "the momentum and time spaces become coupled through the usual drift equation of charged carriers .",
    "remarkably , by analyzing carefully the equations of motion of a general soc model , it is found that the anomalous velocity due to the berry curvature in momentum space is in fact a direct result of the effective magnetic field component arising from @xmath7 . in this sense , the common origin of the two seemingly disparate she s is clarified .",
    "let us briefly review the mechanism for the she of holes in @xmath0-doped semiconductors reported in ref .",
    "the effective luttinger hamiltonian for holes in the valence band of conventional semiconductors is given by@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are valence - band parameters defining the effective hole masses , @xmath11 is the momentum operator , @xmath12 is the vector of spin-@xmath13 matrices , and @xmath14 is the potential energy ( in our notation , a hat @xmath15 signifies an operator while an over - arrow @xmath16 signifies a vector ) .",
    "the holes described by have a well - defined chirality , @xmath17 . because of the chirality - squared term in the hamiltonian , states with opposite signs of chirality ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are degenerate ( they correspond to the light - hole and heavy - hole bands , respectively ) . in the presence of an external electric field",
    "@xmath20 , the potential energy term is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron charge . parameterizing the momentum vector @xmath23",
    ", we proceed to define a @xmath24 unitary matrix @xmath25 , @xmath26 which aligns the reference spin axis to be along the direction of @xmath2 , i.e.  it satisfies the relation @xmath27 .",
    "the effective , diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath28 then reads @xmath29 in the last term of , the position operator @xmath30 acts as a partial derivative in momentum space , and we obtain from the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath31 : @xmath32 thus , under the local transformation , the position operator transforms into covariant form , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a gauge field in reciprocal space . thus far , the transformation @xmath35 is exact .",
    "being a pure gauge field , @xmath36 induced by the transformation has no associated curvature .",
    "assuming adiabatic transport , in which we neglect mixing between the light - hole and heavy - hole bands , and applying an abelian approximation within each hole band , we are left with only the diagonal gauge field components of the respective @xmath37 hole band subspaces .",
    "explicitly , the abelian gauge fields are given by @xmath38 where the superscript _ ad .",
    "_  denotes adiabatic transport , and @xmath39 is the hole chirality .",
    "the corresponding gauge invariant quantity ( which is thus related to a real physical effect ) is the curvature tensor @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 the curvature @xmath40 above is frequently called the berry curvature in momentum space . in the present case , a simple calculation reveals that the berry curvature is @xmath42 i.e.  it is a dirac monopole with strength @xmath43 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath2-space curvature has important implications on carrier dynamics .",
    "in particular , @xmath40 can be regarded as a magnetic field in @xmath2-space , which gives rise to a @xmath2-space lorentz - type force .",

    "the final term in is the lorentz - type force in @xmath2-space , and is equivalent to an additional velocity of electrons corresponding to the so - called anomalous karplus - luttinger term.@xcite substituting the expression for the curvature into the equation of motion , the anomalous velocity component is given by @xmath46 which is perpendicular to both the applied electric field @xmath20 and @xmath2 . since the chirality of the holes has sign @xmath47 @xmath48 for hole spins ( anti-)parallel to the electron momentum , the anomalous velocity is also perpendicular to the spin @xmath12 , and points along opposite directions depending on the sign of the chirality .",
    "this transverse separation of the spins gives rise to the she of holes in the luttinger system .",
    "we now analyze the berry curvature in momentum space for the case of the linear rashba soc,@xcite which is present in two - dimensional electron gases formed in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "we begin with the generalized spin - orbit hamiltonian , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the effective electron mass , @xmath10 is the soc strength , @xmath51 is the vector of pauli spin matrices , @xmath52 is a momentum - dependent effective magnetic field , and @xmath21 in the presence of an external electric field @xmath20 .",
    "the above hamiltonian captures the physics of many other types of soc , including the linear and cubic dresselhaus@xcite and strain - induced@xcite soc systems .",
    "the luttinger hamiltonian can also be transformed to be of this general form when re - cast in terms of the so(5 ) clifford algebra as was done in ref .  [ ] , although this representation is in a 5-dimensional space rather than the usual spin-@xmath53 space .",

    "the velocity along the @xmath195-th coordinate is given by hamilton s equation : @xmath196 , \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{p_i}{m}-\\gamma \\frac{\\partial \\vec{b}(\\vec{k})}{\\partial p_i}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}. \\label{veli.eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the magnetic field is time - dependent , the spins see an additional magnetic field @xmath155 . assuming that spins align to @xmath197 , the spin vector , to first order , is given by @xmath198",
    ". writing the spin - orbit field @xmath199 , the partial derivative in eq .   can be expanded into its magnitude and directional parts as @xmath200 .",
    "taking the adiabatic limit @xmath201 , the second term in the velocity expression becomes @xmath202 writing @xmath203 , where the summation over @xmath204 is implicit , and rearranging the terms we then get @xmath205 the first term in the above equation represents a velocity term that is due to the inhomogeneity of the spin - orbit field @xmath83 in momentum space , i.e.  it is the reciprocal space analogue of the stern - gerlach force .",
    "remarkably , the second term in eq .   is the anomalous velocity of electrons due to berry s curvature in @xmath2-space .",
    "this becomes clearer when written in terms of the magnetic field vector @xmath206 , @xmath207 we find that this is exactly the anomalous velocity component in eq .  , which arises from the berry s curvature in @xmath2-space . by letting the spin vector to be aligned anti - parallel to the net magnetic field , @xmath208 in eq .  , the correct spin - dependence of the anomalous velocity can be obtained .",
    "thus , we have shown that the anomalous velocity due to the berry curvature actually arises because of the @xmath155 magnetic field component , which in turn is related to the time component of the gauge field .",
    "this gauge field component therefore plays an equally important role in the she in the luttinger system , as it does in the rashba one , and acts as the unifying bridge between the two effects .",
    "the primary motivation for this paper is to establish the link between the two intrinsic she s reported in refs .  [ ] , which has not been clarified hitherto .",
    "we first considered the intrinsic she in the luttinger system , which is driven by the spin - dependent anomalous velocity due to the non - trivial curvature of momentum space .",
    "however , this theoretical picture is not applicable in the planar rashba system .",
    "instead , the she in the rashba system was shown to arise from spins acquiring a component ( in the adiabatic sense ) along an additional effective magnetic field @xmath155 , arising from the time - dependence of the system .",
    "this field component was shown to be described by a gauge field in time space .",
    "finally , we showed that in the adiabatic limit , @xmath155 is also the origin of the anomalous velocity due to the momentum space berry curvature .",
    "thus , we conclude that the intrinsic she s in the two systems are simply different manifestations of @xmath155 , and that this term provides a unifying link between the two effects .",
    "consider the dynamics of the spin vector @xmath209 in a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath122 , @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the coupling factor . to solve the above equation , we freeze the time - dependence by transforming to a rotated coordinate frame at each point in time , such that the @xmath124-axis is aligned with the magnetic field . a spin vector @xmath212 defined relative to the coordinate frame at time @xmath103 , is expressed as the vector @xmath213 in the coordinate frame at time @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the generator of infinitesimal rotations ( see fig .",
    "[ spin_prec.fig ] ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath216 is not unique ; however , specifically choosing @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the unit vector @xmath219 as seen in the rotated frame , coincides with the parallel transport of the coordinate frames.@xcite suppose we have a vector representing the spin , @xmath209 , in the rotated frame at time @xmath103 . at time @xmath214 , this vector becomes [ relative to frame @xmath214 ] @xmath221 where @xmath222 .",
    "for infinitesimally small @xmath223 , we may write @xmath224 [ in frame @xmath103 ] @xmath226 [ in frame @xmath214 ] . the right - hand - side of the resulting equation becomes @xmath227 .",
    "rearranging , and taking the limit @xmath228 , we have @xmath229 therefore , as seen in the laboratory frame , there is an additional , effective magnetic field @xmath230 .",
