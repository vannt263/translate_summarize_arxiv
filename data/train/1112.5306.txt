    "in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions performed at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) elliptic flow  the second fourier coefficient @xmath0 that quantifies the azimuthal anisotropy in the measured particle distributions  has been found to be large @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a significant @xmath0 is a clear signature of pressure formation in the system .",
    "it is also consistent with predictions from relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite : at non zero impact parameter the overlap area of the colliding nuclei is eccentric in the transverse coordinate plane .",
    "this spatial anisotropy is translated first into a flow - velocity anisotropy during the hydrodynamical evolution and , finally , at the decoupling of the system , into a measurable momentum - anisotropy of final - state particle distributions .",
    "recently it was found out that geometrical fluctuations in the nucleon transverse positions generate initial state anisotropies @xcite also for odd harmonics @xmath1 .",
    "nowadays , the experiments at rhic and lhc have been able to measure non zero flow coefficients up to @xmath2 @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there have also been considerable developments in event - by - event hydrodynamical modeling @xcite , thanks to which it has become possible to study the higher harmonics @xcite and @xmath3 at mid rapidity @xcite .",
    "studies based on hydrodynamics have shown that all initial - state anisotropies are transferred to the final measurable flow values in a similar way as eccentricity is translated to elliptic flow .    in the past few years much effort",
    "has been put on developing viscous hydrodynamics @xcite and it has turned out that the elliptic flow and especially the higher harmonics are sensitive to the ( shear ) viscosity @xmath4 @xcite . since the final flow observables closely reflect the initial - state spatial anisotropies , the uncertainties in the assumed ( or computed ) initial state",
    "are transferred to the computed final - state flow observables . in the studies where",
    "one has tried to estimate the shear viscosity - to - entropy ratio , @xmath5 , using elliptic flow measurements , one has seen that the initial eccentricity differences between different initial state models lead to large uncertainties in the extracted value of @xmath5 @xcite . for determining the shear viscosity from the flow measurements ,",
    "it is very important to chart all the relevant uncertainties in the computation of the initial asymmetries .",
    "the glauber model @xcite is usually a key element in computing the initial states for hydrodynamical modeling of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "some years back , most hydrodynamical calculations assumed smooth initial states where the ( energy or entropy ) densities were assumed to scale with the density of binary collisions or wounded nucleons computed from the optical glauber model ; see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "now that the importance of the initial density fluctuations has been realized , monte carlo glauber ( mcg ) modeling has become more frequently used .",
    "so far the black disk ( hard - sphere ) modeling of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interactions has been the standard choice @xcite in these studies , although also more involved probabilistic ways to model the @xmath6 interactions have been known for a long time @xcite .    for mcg modeling",
    ", one needs the nucleon configurations inside the colliding nuclei as an input for each event . in the simplest approximation the nucleons",
    "are assumed point - like and the nucleon positions are obtained by just randomly sampling the woods - saxon number density distribution . however , to improve the modeling , @xmath6 correlations should also be considered , as suggested in refs .",
    "experimental evidence for the two - body @xmath6 correlations generating high - momentum components of the nuclear wave function @xcite , are discussed in refs .",
    "furthermore , recent studies in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that the effects from including more realistic @xmath6 correlations are not negligible e.g. in the generated initial eccentricity .    in this paper",
    "we study for au - au collision at rhic energies , two different uncertainties in computing the initial state asymmetries from the mcg model : one related to the modeling of the inelastic @xmath6 collisions between nucleons from different nuclei , and one related to the @xmath6 correlations in the nucleon configurations in each of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucl conf ] we outline how the initial nucleon configurations can be obtained taking the @xmath6 correlations into account .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction ] , we present two different ways to model the inelastic @xmath6 primary collisions . the studied initial - state anisotropies are defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropy ] , and results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the initial state of a nucleus in the mcg calculations is usually taken as a collection of particles distributed according to a probability distribution given by the corresponding ( woods - saxon ) number density distribution measured in electron scattering experiments .",
    "given the complexity of the nuclear many - body problem , the effects of spatial , spin and isospin dependent correlations among the nucleons are usually overlooked and the nucleons are positioned randomly for each of the simulated events .    recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how such an approach can be modified by including initial states , which are prepared in advance , in the commonly used computer codes . also , a method to produce such configurations was introduced .",
    "the method is based on the notion of a nuclear wave function @xmath7 , which contains the nucleonic degrees of freedom and which is used to iteratively modify the positions of randomly distributed nucleons using the metropolis method so that the final positions correspond to the probability density given by @xmath8 .",
    "the method is constructed to reproduce the same nucleon number - density distribution as the usual one and , in addition , to reproduce the basic features of the two - nucleon density in the presence of the @xmath6 correlations .",
    "the model wave function is taken in the form ( _ 1, ... ,_a)=^a_i < j_ij(_1, ... ,_a ) , where @xmath9 is the uncorrelated wave function and @xmath10 are correlation operators ; here , @xmath11 denotes the position , spin and isospin projection of the @xmath12-th nucleon .",
    "the correlation operator contains a detailed spin - isospin dependence , which is as follows :    [ massi1 ] _",
    "ij=&f^c(r_ij ) + f^(r_ij)_i_j + f^(r_ij)_i_j + & + f^(r_ij)_i_j_i_j + f^t(r_ij)_ij + & + f^t(r_ij)_ij_i_j + ... ,    where @xmath13 is the relative distance between nucleons @xmath12 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pauli spin and isospin operators , respectively , and @xmath17 is the so - called tensor operator ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) which depends on the spin and spatial variables of nucleons @xmath12 and @xmath14 . in the most general case ,",
    "the sum extends over a number of channels that are the same as the one appearing in modern nucleon - nucleon potentials used to successfully describe a variety of properties of light and medium - heavy nuclei within different _ _",
    "ab initi__o approaches . when all the correlation functions in eq .",
    "( [ massi1 ] ) , except the first one [ @xmath18 , vanish , we have the central correlation case .    in this paper",
    "we will consider configurations produced both with the central correlations only ( denoted in the following by _ central _ ) and with a full set of the six correlation functions of eq .",
    "( [ massi1 ] ) ( denoted by _ full _ ) , including the tensor operator .",
    "these correlation functions @xcite were developed by variational method for nuclei lighter than @xmath19au considered in this paper ; nevertheless , they represent the best approximation that we can offer , since no corresponding calculations exist for heavy nuclei .",
    "more specifically , we used correlation functions obtained for @xmath20ca .",
    "many recent theoretical works support the universality of @xmath6 correlations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "we justify the use of @xmath20ca correlation functions by the observation that they differ very little from those obtained for @xmath21o ; @xmath20ca is a large enough nucleus to neglect additional differences with @xmath19au due to @xmath22 dependence in this context , as well as differences arising from the fact that correlation functions were obtained for doubly magic , symmetric nuclei such as @xmath21o and @xmath20ca .",
    "moreover , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - body densities resulting from configurations obtained using these correlations are clearly more realistic than the completely uncorrelated ones .    the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite allows in principle to deal with any set of correlations ; nevertheless , although the state dependent correlations introduce an extra computational effort due to their non commutative nature , they can be treated up to a certain degree . in this paper",
    "we have used configurations including two - body full correlations , and configurations of three - body clusters surrounding each of the nucleons , induced by full correlations .",
    "genuine three - body correlations will also be discussed in the following .",
    "we work in the glauber model framework @xcite , neglecting the effects of inelastic diffraction that lead to fluctuations of the strength of the @xmath6 interactions @xcite . to generate the inelastic @xmath6 collisions of interest here",
    ", we use the following two different approximations for deciding whether a collision between the nucleons @xmath12 and @xmath14 from different nuclei takes place :     _ black disk _ approximation , used recently , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one assumes the two nucleons to interact inelastically with a probability one if their transverse separation @xmath23 is within a radius defined by the inelastic @xmath6 cross section @xmath24 , [ bdisk ] ^2_ij ;     _ profile function approach _ , where the probability of an inelastic interaction between the nucleons @xmath12 and @xmath14 is given by [ intprob ] p(_ij)=1-|1-(_ij)|^2 , and where the profile function @xmath25 is expressed in terms of the total and elastic @xmath6 cross sections as follows : [ gamma ] ( _ ij)=e^-b^2_ij/(2b ) , with @xmath26 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath27 can be derived in the born approximation of the potential - scattering formalism , by parametrizing the @xmath6 elastic scattering amplitude as @xcite [ ampl ] f()=e^-b q^2 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants to be determined , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for ultra - relativistic energies . for the small - angle scatterings of interest here",
    ", the vector * q * corresponds to the difference between the incoming and scattered wave vectors in the transverse plane , and @xmath32 relates to the scattering angle as @xmath33 .",
    "we fix @xmath28 to the measured @xmath34 on the basis of the optical theorem , [ opt_th ] ^tot_nn = im[f ( ) ] .",
    "the profile function in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) is obtained as a fourier transform , [ gammb ] ( _ ij)=d^2e^-i_ijf ( ) , and the elastic @xmath6 cross section from this as [ elas ] ^el_nn = d^2_ij|(_ij)|^2 .",
    "thus , we have [ ssel ] ^el_nn&= & , + [ stot ] ^tot_nn&=&^el_nn+^in_nn , and @xmath29 can be fixed on the basis of measured cross sections . for the current set - up at @xmath35  gev , we take @xmath36  gev@xmath37 and @xmath38  mb , which correspond to @xmath39  mb and @xmath40  mb .    finally , using eqs .",
    "( [ opt_th ] ) , ( [ elas ] ) and ( [ stot ] ) , we arrive at the probability function of eq .",
    "( [ intprob ] ) , whose integral over the transverse separation gives the inelastic @xmath6 cross section : ^in_nn&=&d^2_ij(2 re(_ij)-|(_ij)|^2 ) + [ inel ] & = & d^2_ij(1-|1-(_ij)|^2 ) .      in this section",
    "we define the initial state anisotropies , which are studied in this work .",
    "we focus on the first three harmonics @xmath41 : dipole asymmetry , eccentricity , and triangularity .",
    "higher harmonics are left out since they are more complicated due to the fact that they can be mainly originating from the lower harmonics @xcite . also , from the experimental results we know that the second and third harmonics are the largest ones .",
    "we calculate the asymmetries from the wounded nucleon positions which are obtained from the mcg model . in the following ,",
    "the angle brackets denote an average over wounded , or participant , nucleons .",
    "the asymmetries are defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a weight and @xmath44 is an orientation angle that is obtained as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is always placed in the correct quadrant .",
    "these quantities are always calculated in the center - of - mass of the wounded nucleon system .",
    "we choose to use @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath47 for @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we also study the fluctuations of the initial - state asymmetries since the current flow analysis methods are sensitive to the fluctuations of the flow coefficients @xcite .",
    "since final flow values reflect the initial - state asymmetries , the fluctuations of the flow coefficients should follow the initial - state fluctuations .",
    "we define the fluctuations of the anisotropies as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the asymmetry in event @xmath12 and @xmath54 denotes the average over @xmath55 events .",
    "first we look how the interaction models and @xmath6 correlations affect the number of the participants ( @xmath56 ) and binary collisions ( @xmath57 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wounded ] we have plotted these as a function of the impact parameter .",
    "one can see that in central collisions the results are the same with both interaction models , but when impact parameter becomes large , @xmath58  fm , i.e. , when only the edges of the nuclei collide and when the number of participants and binary collisions are of the same order , the difference between models is over 5  % .",
    "this holds both for wounded nucleons and binary collisions . from fig .",
    "[ fig : wounded ] it can be seen that the effects of @xmath6 correlations on these quantities are very small .     with uncorrelated configurations ( black solid line ) ; the profile function approach with central @xmath6 correlations ( red squares ) ; and the profile function approach with full @xmath6 configurations ( blue circles ) .",
    "the insets show the ratios of the last three cases to the black disk + uncorrelated one , with corresponding notations.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]   with uncorrelated configurations ( black solid line ) ; the profile function approach with central @xmath6 correlations ( red squares ) ; and the profile function approach with full @xmath6 configurations ( blue circles ) .",
    "the insets show the ratios of the last three cases to the black disk + uncorrelated one , with corresponding notations.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]      next , we consider the two different interaction models discussed in sec .  [ sec : interaction ] and present their effects on the anisotropies defined above . in these calculations",
    "the @xmath6 correlations are neglected for clarity ; the effects of these correlations will be studied in the next section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction eps ] we have plotted the anisotropies @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 as a function of @xmath63 using the black disk and profile function approaches to model the inelastic @xmath6 collisions . the black disk approximation results in larger dipole asymmetry @xmath60 , eccentricity @xmath61 , and triangularity @xmath62 .",
    "in all cases , the obtained asymmetries in the profile function approach are slightly ( @xmath64  % ) smaller than in those in the black disk case .",
    "apparently , toward peripheral collisions , we have more fluctuations and a less - well - defined shape with the profile function approach , hence a smaller @xmath59 .     as a function of the number of participants .",
    "results shown are for the two different interaction models . in these plots",
    "no @xmath6 correlations are taken into account.,width=340 ]    the difference between these two cases is negligible in most central collisions for every @xmath65 .",
    "when moving toward peripheral collisions , the results start to deviate from each other and the largest difference is approximately on the order of 10% . in central collisions most of the nucleons experience several collisions and , thus , the details of the collision model are not very important . in peripheral collisions , however , more and more of the nucleons collide only once or twice , meaning that the interaction model details start to play a role .",
    "one must also remember that as we saw from fig .",
    "[ fig : wounded ] , the events with the same impact parameter are mapped to slightly smaller @xmath66 values with the black disk interaction model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction sigma ] we plot the relative fluctuations of the initial - state anisotropies . here",
    "the order of the curves is opposite compared to the @xmath59 when @xmath50 , @xmath67 .",
    "this means that at least partly the difference in the relative fluctuations is explained simply by the fact that the absolute value is slightly higher in the case where the relative fluctuations are smaller . for @xmath60",
    "the relative fluctuations are larger with black disk interaction , indicating that then also the absolute fluctuations are larger with black disk than profile interaction .     as a function of number of participants .",
    "results are shown with two different interaction models . in these plots",
    "no @xmath6 correlations are taken into account .",
    ", width=340 ]    the relative fluctuations of @xmath60 show a decreasing trend when approaching central collisions but the impact - parameter dependence is relatively weak .",
    "on the other hand , the relative fluctuations of @xmath61 clearly depend on the impact parameter . in central collisions",
    "the fluctuations are large since the system is azimuthally very symmetric , and toward peripheral collisions the fluctuations decrease , since the collision area becomes clearly eccentric .",
    "triangularity @xmath62 has yet another behavior : its relative fluctuations stay approximately constant when @xmath68 .",
    "since the triangularity is created purely by the fluctuations in the positions of wounded nucleons , we can expect that the relative fluctuations have no centrality dependence .",
    "all in all , @xmath69 and @xmath70 have only a mild centrality dependence , while @xmath71 exhibits a clear dependence on the centrality .",
    "in addition , we conclude that for these relative fluctuations , the @xmath6 interaction model uncertainties do not play a major role .",
    "next , we investigate the effects of different models for the initial state @xmath6 correlations .",
    "we have chosen to use the @xmath72 collision profile function in these calculations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation eps ] we have plotted the obtained anisotropies with three different @xmath6 correlations : no correlations at all , only central correlations and full correlations . from all panels",
    "we see that no correlations and full correlations are very close to each other , but the central correlations have a smaller anisotropy .     as a function of number of participants .",
    "results are shown with different @xmath6 correlations and using the @xmath72 collision profile function approach.,width=340 ]    in all cases the difference between central correlations and the two other cases is largest at central collisions and it gets smaller toward peripheral collision .",
    "nucleon correlations are most important in the middle of the nucleus since the nucleon density is largest there .",
    "thus , in the central collisions , where most of the wounded nucleons come from the middle of the nuclei , the effect on anisotropies is largest .",
    "when moving toward the peripheral collisions , the relative amount of wounded nucleons coming from the edges of nuclei is increasing .",
    "thus , in very peripheral collisions where only the edges are overlapping , the effect disappears .",
    "we must bear in mind that central correlations have only repulsive character ; their effect can be mimicked by an ad - hoc exclusion radius , as shown in ref .",
    "full state - dependent correlations , instead , have a complex structure , which causes nucleons to be at a given average distance in the nucleus and results in nuclear binding and its saturation with increasing @xmath22 . partially including these full correlations and     as a function of the number of participants .",
    "results are shown with different @xmath6 correlations and using the @xmath72 collision profile approach.,width=340 ]    disregarding three - body repulsion , as it is explained below , produces the net result of working in the opposite direction of repulsion , for the considered quantities .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation sigma ] , we plot the relative fluctuations of anisotropies with different initial state @xmath6 correlations .",
    "we can see that inclusion of full correlations brings the results back toward the uncorrelated case ; this is less evident for @xmath73 .",
    "however , now the difference is small in the central collisions and it is largest in the semi peripheral collisions .",
    "the difference again vanishes at the most peripheral collisions .",
    "the results obtained with realistic configurations deserve some discussion .",
    "the production of configurations with full realistic correlation functions differs substantially from the central correlations case , since in the realistic description there are several spatially - dependent correlation functions complemented with spin- and isospin - dependent operators , as shown in eq .  .",
    "at this stage , we have performed a truncation of the chains induced by realistic correlations at the level of three - particle chains ; in principle , due to the non commutativity of the operators in eq .",
    ", the chains are @xmath22-body operators .",
    "moreover , we restricted our calculations to three particles which are within a given radius from the active particle in the metropolis algorithm .",
    "it should be stressed that these kinds of simplifications are not        suggested by specific physics arguments but are rather dictated by the enormously increasing computing time . as a result ,",
    "the truncation obviously induces some amount of uncertainty in our results .",
    "the overall trend , that the full correlations seem to bring the results back toward the no correlation case , is nevertheless what we wish to emphasize here .    in order to illustrate the effect of the truncation",
    ", we have repeated the calculation with configurations including only two - body , realistically correlated clusters ( 2b only ) , and compared with the three - body calculation outlined above ( 3b chains ) .",
    "the results for @xmath74 are compared with the corresponding uncorrelated and central correlation case in fig .",
    "[ fig : full correlations ] .",
    "interestingly , it can be seen that the full correlations with the 2 body chains cause an effect into the opposite direction than the more advanced 3b chains do .",
    "although beyond the scope of this paper , it would be interesting to study how sensitive the considered anisotropies , and also the higher moments of participant matter distribution , are to the higher - order chains of two - body state - dependent correlations and to the genuine three - body correlations which we have not included here .",
    "the outcome of such a study is , however , difficult to predict , due to the complicated interplay of attraction and repulsion between the three particles in different spin and isospin states .",
    "in this paper we have charted some of the uncertainties in the computation of the initial state anisotropies from the monte carlo glauber model .",
    "we used two different ways of modeling the inelastic interactions between the colliding nucleons .",
    "the difference between these two cases gives us an estimate about the uncertainties related to this part of the model : in central collisions the details of the interaction model play a minor role , but in the peripheral collisions such details can cause uncertainties up to 10% in the first three harmonics @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we also checked that with these two interaction models the difference in the number of wounded nucleons and binary collisions remains small in central collisions , but at impact parameters 10 - 15 fm the difference can be around 10% .",
    "we also note that during the writing process of this article , a similar nucleon interaction model study was released in ref .",
    "the main differences to our study are the different form of the elastic @xmath6 scattering amplitude as well as the treatment of the @xmath6 correlations .",
    "we also presented a study of the effects of @xmath6 correlations with an update of correlated configurations and extended discussion as compared with the previous published papers on this subject .",
    "we confirmed that the inclusion of centrally correlated nucleon configurations produce the effects to eccentricity and its relative variance as was claimed by ref .",
    "@xcite . as a new result",
    ", we observed that the inclusion of realistically correlated configurations ( two - body full correlations , three - body chains ) seems to essentially cancel this effect and bring the results back close to the no correlations case .",
    "the effect is similar for dipole asymmetry and triangularity as for eccentricity .",
    "however , we also showed that there are still uncertainties caused by the truncation done in the nucleon configuration calculation with full correlations and we expect three - body correlations to play a role .    in this paper we studied two sources of additional uncertainty in the monte carlo model calculations for the initial state anisotropies .",
    "the uncertainty caused by the studied effects to these anisotropies was found to be maximally of the order of 10% . now that  thanks to the recent developments in event - by - event hydrodynamics  more precise comparisons of flow coefficients between the data and the theory are becoming possible , it is important to chart all the relevant uncertainties to this precision , so that the qcd matter properties could eventually be determined from the measured particle spectra and their azimuthal asymmetries .",

    "<S> in hydrodynamical modeling of heavy - ion collisions , the initial - state spatial anisotropies are translated into momentum anisotropies of the final - state particle distributions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , understanding the origin of the initial - state anisotropies and their uncertainties is important before extracting specific qcd matter properties , such as viscosity , from the experimental data . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we review the wounded nucleon approach based on the monte carlo glauber model , charting in particular the uncertainties arising from modeling of the nucleon - nucleon interactions between the colliding nucleon pairs and nucleon - nucleon correlations inside the colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the differences between the black disk model and a probabilistic profile function approach for the inelastic nucleon - nucleon interactions , and investigate the influence of initial - state correlations using state - of - the - art modeling of these . </S>"
