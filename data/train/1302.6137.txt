    "consequently , the influence of scattering due to the random chemical potential can not be neglected .",
    "as expected , the flows of velocities @xmath2 and @xmath26 are heavily dependent on the magnitude of @xmath27 . according to expression ( [ eq_rg_vdf ] ) , it seems that the running behavior of the velocity ratio @xmath25 ( or @xmath190 ) is independent of the disorder strength @xmath27 .",
    "however , this is artificial . in the present problem , the flow equation of @xmath25 ( or @xmath190 )",

    "( [ fig_v_f - v_d ] ) . therefore , there is no fixed point of the fermion velocities @xmath2 and @xmath26 in this case .",
    "we interpret this as an indicator of the instability of the quantum phase transition in the presence of the random chemical potential .    for completeness",
    ", we would like to make brief statements with various types of disorders present .",
    "in general , there may be a certain number of kinds of disorders in realistic physical problems @xcite .",
    "first , we consider a case in presence of the random chemical potential and random mass ( and/or random gauge potential ) . since the random mass and random gauge potential are both irrelevant , the marginal random chemical potential dominates and destroys the fixed points @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the corresponding fixed points would remain for a combination of two irrelevant cases of random mass and random gauge potential .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the overall effects of disorders by investigating the three types of disorders separately .",
    "in an actual @xmath17-wave cuprate superconductor , the fermion velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the gapless nodal qps are not equal . indeed , the ratio @xmath180 may be as low as @xmath206 @xcite . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_numerical ] , the value of this ratio @xmath180 will be extremely influenced by @xmath14-ordering fluctuations in the proximity of quantum critical points .",
    "since the ratio plays an important role by entering a number of physical quantities @xcite , it is natural to expect numerous intriguing effects due to the significant changes in the ratio @xmath180 . in this section",
    ", we primarily address the behavior of superfluid density and critical temperature at different quantum critical points .",
    "the superfluid density is an important quantity that characterizes the fundamental feature of the @xmath17-wave superconducting state . in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the superfluid density is known to exhibit a linear @xmath10-dependence as @xcite @xmath207 with a coefficient proportional to the inverse of the velocity ratio @xmath180 . here",
    ", @xmath208 is the superfluid density at zero temperature in the underdoped region @xcite , where @xmath115 and @xmath38 represent the doping concentration and lattice spacing , respectively . for non - interacting nodal qps",
    ", the velocity ratio takes a bare constant , @xmath209 @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "an intimately related quantity is the critical temperature @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath210 where @xmath115 is the doping concentration .",
    "close to the critical point of the @xmath14 matrix state , due to the strong @xmath14-order - parameter fluctuations , the velocity ratio flows upon lowering the energy scale .",
    "the effects of velocity renormalizations should be taken into account . to study these in detail , after including the flow of velocities , eqs .",

    "this leads to the suppression of the superfluid density in case the @xmath18 @xcite and growth in the rest of the cases .",
    "the numerical results for superfluid densities and critical temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_tem - rho ] ) .",
    "as mentioned , based on the fixed point @xmath22 for @xmath224 , the superfluid density and critical temperature are both suppressed . on the other hand , they are slightly increased in the case of @xmath101 . furthermore , to the case @xmath121 , it exhibits substantial enhancements owing to the running flow to @xmath225 . since plenty of approximations are unavoidably employed during the calculations , we need to point out here that the quantitative enhancements may not be reliable .",
    "however , the qualitative increments of superfluid density and critical temperature would be unambiguous .",
    "next , we discuss the effects caused by disorders , including random mass , random gauge potential , and random chemical potential . according to the analysis in sec .",
    "[ subsec_disorder ] , the disorder strength @xmath27 is irrelevant both for random mass and for random gauge potential",
    ". therefore , the behavior of the superfluid density and critical temperature mentioned in the previous paragraph are unchanged in the presence of these two types of disorders . by comparison ,",
    "quantum phase transitions are unstable against the random chemical potential .",
    "this suggests that the corresponding fixed points do not exist .    in brief",
    ", we conclude that distinct behaviors of physical quantities , such as superfluid density and critical temperature , will be generated by the influence of singular velocity renormalization near the presumable @xmath14-ordering quantum critical points . as a consequence ,",
    "this leads to a possible way to determine the @xmath14-ordering quantum critical points by seeking these singular behaviors .",
    "this may be of great help to understand the complicated phase diagram and many anomalous features of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "in summary , we investigate unusual renormalizations of the fermi velocity @xmath2 and gap velocity @xmath3 of nodal qps close to diverse quantum critical points classified by vertex matrices ( [ eq_s_psi - phi ] ) in the @xmath17-wave superconducting dome . according to the spirit of the rg method @xcite , the series of rg equations@xmath226both in clean limit and in the presence of three types of static disorders , namely",

    "in particular , we calculate the superfluid density and critical temperature .",
    "they are affected sensitively by approaching these fixed points .",
    "superfluid densities and critical temperatures are both suppressed , slightly increased , and significantly enhanced for cases @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "three types of disorder effects on these fixed points are also examined .",
    "we present a series of coupled rg equations of fermi velocity @xmath2 , gap velocity @xmath26 , and disorder strength parameter @xmath27 .",
    "after both analytical and numerical computations , we find that fixed points obtained in the clean limit are robustly stable in the presence of random mass and random gauge potential .",
    "however , these fixed points are destroyed in the presence of a random chemical potential which is marginal .",
    "therefore , this is responsible for the instabilities of quantum phase transitions .",
    "the corresponding effects on physical quantities are also studied .",
    "compared to the clean limit , the behaviors of physical quantities controlled by fixed points , such as the superfluid density and critical temperature depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig_tem - rho ] ) , are unchanged when a random mass or random gauge potential is included .",
    "on the other hand , the effects of quantum critical fluctuations on physical observables can be neglected due to the fixed points broken in the presence of a random chemical potential .",
    "the occurrence of quantum phase transition stems from competition among ground state phases @xcite .",
    "the physical behavior of a system is influenced significantly within a wide scope of the phase diagram , especially near quantum critical points where fluctuations are divergent @xcite . by studying various quantum phase transitions in a superconducting dome",
    ", the critical behavior of physical quantities can be captured .",
    "remarkably , this provides a helpful clue to confirm or even locate the very existence of quantum critical points by means of detecting these singular behaviors .",
