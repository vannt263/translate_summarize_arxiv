    "modern measurements of the casimir force@xcite have been actively pursued since 1997 ( reviews@xcite contain the description of all experiments performed up to 2001 and 2009 , respectively ) . in this period",
    "it has been conclusively demonstrated that the casimir force can be reproducibly measured using modern laboratory techniques .",
    "the obtained results have found prospective applications ranging from nanotechnology@xcite to constraining parameters of fundamental physical theories beyond the standard model.@xcite    the lifshitz theory@xcite of the van der waals and casimir forces has been applied to two semispaces made of real materials at nonzero temperature@xcite and generalized for interacting surfaces of arbitrary shape.@xcite the comparison between the measurement data and computations using the lifshitz theory with particular dielectric permittivities has shown areas of disagreement .",
    "it was found that theoretical predictions obtained using the dielectric permittivity of the drude model are excluded by the data of three precise experiments@xcite on indirect dynamic determination of the casimir pressure between two parallel metallic plates performed in the configuration of a sphere above a plate by means of a micromachined oscillator at separations from 0.16 to @xmath2 m ( note that in the modern phase of measurements of the casimir force the experimental configuration of two parallel plates was used only in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the same data were found consistent with the lifshitz theory combined with the generalized plasma - like model.@xcite coincidently it was proven@xcite that the lifshitz theory combined with the plasma model satisfies the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) , but violates this fundamental physical principle when the dielectric permittivity of the drude model for metals with perfect crystal lattices is used . keeping in mind that the dielectric response of metals for real electromagnetic fields is correctly described by the drude model , whereas the plasma model is an approximation applicable only at sufficiently high frequencies , these results initiated continuing discussions.@xcite",
    "specifically , it was suggested to carefully check all approximations used in the computations , in particular , the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) , reconsider the role of such background effects as electrostatic patch potentials and surface roughness , and to determine the role of variations in optical data of the au films .",
    "results similar in spirit were obtained with dielectric surfaces .",
    "thus , measurements of the difference in the casimir forces between an au - coated sphere and si plate in the presence and in the absence of a laser pulse on a plate measured by means of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) at short separations were found to be consistent with the lifshitz theory when neglecting the dc conductivity of dielectric si in the dark phase.@xcite the same measurement data exclude the lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity of si taken into account in the absence of a laser pulse.@xcite measurements of the thermal casimir - polder force between @xmath3rb atoms belonging to the bose - einstein condensate and sio@xmath4 plate@xcite agree well with the lifshitz theory neglecting the dc conductivity of sio@xmath4 , but were found@xcite in clear disagreement with the same theory including the dc conductivity in the computations . on the theoretical side , it was demonstrated@xcite that the lifshitz theory for dielectrics with included dc conductivity violates the nernst heat theorem",
    ". theoretical and experimental advances in the casimir effect , including the unresolved problems , are discussed in the book,@xcite whereas reviews@xcite present details of experiments with fluids and semiconductors , respectively .    recently",
    "two more experiments were performed .",
    "the first of them@xcite was performed by means of a torsion pendulum .",
    "it reports observation of the thermal casimir force at large separations @xmath5 m between a spherical lens of @xmath6 cm radius of curvature and a plane plate both coated with au , as predicted by the lifshitz theory using the drude model .",
    "this experiment did not directly measure the casimir force but up to an order of magnitude larger total force presumably determined by large electrostatic patches.@xcite the casimir force was extracted using a fitting procedure with two fitting parameters .",
    "the results of this experiment are in contradiction with two earlier torsion - pendulum experiments performed at large separations,@xcite and with dynamic measurements by means of micromachined oscillator.@xcite these results have been called into question in the literature.@xcite the second of two recent experiments measured the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and an indium tin oxide ( ito ) plate using an afm in the static mode.@xcite it was shown that the uv treatment of an ito plate results in up to 35% decrease in the magnitude of the casimir force . on the basis of the lifshitz theory this was explained by the mott - anderson phase transition of the ito plate under the influence of uv treatment from metal to dielectric state , where the dc conductivity of ito was omitted in computations . however , the inclusion of the dc conductivity of the uv - treated sample results in the contradiction of theoretical predictions with the experimental data .    keeping in mind that the lifshitz theory faces outstanding problems when using the most natural and well tested models of dielectric response ,",
    "it is important to perform more experiments on measuring the casimir force between au surfaces particularly using a laboratory setup different in technique and preparation of the test bodies and from those applied previously . in this paper",
    "we report measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated hollow glass microsphere and an au - coated sapphire plate by means of the dynamic afm operated in the frequency shift technique ( also referred to as frequency modulation ) .",
    "previously measurements of the casimir interaction between au surfaces , allowing discrimination between predictions of the drude and plasma models at short separations , were performed by means of a micromachined oscillator.@xcite the experiment@xcite with au - coated surfaces of a sapphire disk and a polystyrene sphere using the static afm was not enough precise to discriminate between different theoretical predictions .",
    "similar afm experiments have been performed in the dynamic mode using the phase shift@xcite and the amplitude shift@xcite techniques .",
    "these have also not been precise enough to distinguish between the various models . in the frequency shift technique",
    ", the gradient of the casimir force acting on the cantilever modifies the resonant frequency and the corresponding shift in frequency is recorded using a phase locked loop ( with application to afm the frequency shift technique is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the frequency shift technique is free from limitations inherent to the phase shift and amplitude shift techniques and leads to a factor of 10 larger sensitivity .",
    "this allows discrimination between different theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force using the afm .",
    "this experiment was performed at a lower pressure of @xmath0torr .",
    "much attention was paid to electrostatic calibration .",
    "specifically , all mechanical drifts were measured and the corresponding corrections in the measured quantities were introduced . as a result , the residual potential difference , the closest sphere - plate separation and the coefficient converting the frequency shift into the force gradient were found independent of separation distance .",
    "the numerical simulation of the electrostatic force due to electrostatic patch potentials was performed .",
    "it was shown that for both small and large patches the residual potential between the sphere and the plate would heavily depend on the separation for patch sizes of order or larger than this separation .",
    "the absence of such dependence in our measurements confirms the fact that the interacting regions of the test bodies used were free from work function inhomogeneities of a size scale which may significantly distort the total force measured .",
    "the gradient of the casimir force between the sphere and the plate was obtained in two different ways : from the total force ( electric plus casimir ) with different applied voltages and electric force subtracted ( 44 measurement sets ) and in an immediate way by the application of only the compensating voltage to counterbalance the residual potential difference ( 40 measurement sets ) .",
    "the mean gradients of the casimir force obtained in these two ways were found in good mutual agreement and in agreement with the measurements by means of the micromachined oscillator.@xcite the random , systematic and total experimental errors at a 67% confidence level have been determined .",
    "the experimental data were compared with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory . in so doing the corrections to the pfa obtained from exact calculations in the sphere - plate geometry",
    "were taken into account .",
    "computations of the gradient of the casimir force were performed taking the surface roughness into account .",
    "the roughness profiles were investigated using an atomic force microscope . in computations",
    "the optical data for the complex index of refraction of au from different sources have been used . the theoretical prediction using the drude model approach ( i.e. ,",
    "the tabulated optical data for the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity extrapolated to lower frequencies by the imaginary part of the drude model ) is excluded by the results of our measurements at a 67% confidence level over the separation region from 235 to 420 nm . the lifshitz theory combined with the generalized plasma - like model",
    "is shown to be consistent with the measurement data over the entire measurement range from 235 to 750 nm .",
    "we have also studied the oscillator system used in the experiment in the nonlinear regime and determined the application region of the linear equation used to convert the frequency shift of the oscillator into the gradient of the casimir force .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the experimental setup and scheme for dynamic measurements of the gradient of the casimir force in the frequency shift technique .",
    "electrostatic calibrations and related problems are considered in sec .",
    ", we pay special attention to the problem of patch potentials by performing numerical simulations of additional forces due to electrostatic patches or contaminants .",
    "all calibrations are performed with account of the mechanical drift in separation distances .",
    "section  iv contains measurement results for the gradient of the casimir force .",
    "we present the measurement data obtained in two ways , with applied compensating voltage and with applied different voltages with subsequent subtraction of the electric force . in sec .",

    "the role of nonlinear effects in dynamic measurements using an afm is discussed in sec .",
    "vi . in sec .",
    "vii the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .",
    "the main role in the setup for dynamic measurement of the gradient of the casimir force in the frequency shift technique [ see fig .  1(a ) ] is played by the detection system .",
    "this system consists of an afm cantilever with attached sphere , piezoelectric actuator , fiber interferometers , light source and phase locked loop ( pll ) .",
    "the detection system was placed in a high vacuum chamber [ see fig .",
    "the high vacuum down to @xmath7torr was created and sustained with the help of different pumps , valves , gauges and various vacuum feed - throughs .",
    "we begin the description of the setup with the vacuum system .    for the main vacuum chamber an @xmath8 six - way stainless steel cross was used .",
    "this chamber was mounted on a @xmath8 ion pump .",
    "the chamber was first evacuated by a turbo - pump backed by an oil - free dry scroll mechanical pump .",
    "the first two pumps can achieve a vacuum down to @xmath9torr .",
    "the ion pump allows to reach a vacuum of @xmath7torr .",
    "the vacuum chamber was separated from the turbo and mechanical pumps by a gate valve which can be closed when only the ion pump is to be used .",
    "the low vacuum pressure less than @xmath10torr was measured with a thermal - conductivity gauge . for measuring high vacuums of @xmath7torr",
    "an ionization gauge was used .",
    "the main vacuum chamber was supported on a damped optical table having a large mass to reduce the mechanical noise . for the electrical connections to elements inside the vacuum chamber",
    "d - type subminiature connections were used offering uhv feed - through with 25 pins which were hermetically sealed and insulated by means of glass ceramic bonding . for optical connections a home - built optical fiber feed - through was used made on a cf flange welded with a clean stainless tube .",
    "a cladding - stripped 1550 nm fiber was inserted through the steel tube and sealed using varian vacuum torr seal .",
    "we continue the description of the setup by acquaintance with the fiber interferometers [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) for more details ] .",
    "two fiber optic interferometers were used .",
    "one interferometer monitored the cantilever oscillation .",
    "the second recorded the displacement of the au plate mounted on the afm piezoelectric actuator . for constructing the interferometer",
    ", we used a 1550 nm single mode fiber which has extremely low bending loss and low splice loss compared to the standard smf-28 1550 nm fiber . a super luminescent diode with a wavelength of 1550 nm , served as the light source for the cantilever frequency measurement interferometer .",
    "the coherence length of the diode was @xmath11 m .",
    "a short coherence length is necessary to avoid noise from spurious interferences from unwanted reflections .",
    "an optical isolator with fc - apc connectors joined the diode to a 50/50 directional coupler .",
    "we used the typical fused - tapered bi - conic coupler at 1550 nm wavelength with return - loss of 55db relative to the input power . to reduce the signal power attenuation , we avoided bulkhead connectors which usually have @xmath12db power loss . a fiber coupled laser source with a wavelength of 635",
    "nm was used for the au plate displacement interferometer . in our experimental setup",
    ", we used a commercial anodized black xyz - stage [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] to move the fiber end vertically above and close to the cantilever .",
    "but the anodizing may significantly increase outgassing rates because of its porous structure .",
    "therefore special treatments were done before placing the xyz - stage into the high vacuum chamber .",
    "the xyz - stage was first disassembled and the parts scrubbed with strong solution of detergent in an ultrasonic cleaner .",
    "they were then rinsed with very hot water .",
    "next they were immersed in a 10% solution of sodium hydroxide ( naoh ) saturated with common salt ( nacl ) at @xmath13c .",
    "the parts were then polished in a conventional wheel polishing machine .",
    "they were then immersed in 10% solution of hydrochloric acid to obtain a bright finish .",
    "this was then followed by rinsing in di water and reassembly of the xyz stage using powder - free disposable plastic gloves . finally the xyz stage was rinsed with acetone followed by ethyl alcohol before insertion into the vacuum chamber .",
    "the interferometer system [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] used for measuring the frequency shift consists of the following parts .",
    "the output of the directional couplers was measured with ingaas photodetectors . a low noise photodetector and",
    "amplifier system was fabricated for the cantilever interferometer . to avoid any potential errors or noise from the divider or balancing system ,",
    "the ingaas diode was coupled to an opa627 low noise operational amplifier ( very high input impedance @xmath14 ) as a trans - impedance amplifier .",
    "the output of the interference signal was fed into a band - pass filter cascaded by low and high pass filter to cut off unwanted frequency bands .",
    "the high - pass filter helped us to remove the noise in the excitation signal from frequency modulation controller and the low - pass filter removed @xmath15 and environmental noise . for frequency",
    "demodulation we use a pll ( nano surf . ) .",
    "the pll frequency demodulator system combines a controller module and detector module to measure the force gradient induced resonant frequency shift .",
    "the output of the high pass filter was fed to the pll for the frequency demodulation .",
    "the output of the pll was connected to a piezoelectric transducer which drives the cantilever at its resonant frequency @xmath16khz with a constant amplitude .",
    "the oscillation amplitude of the cantilever was fixed at @xmath17 nm for all separations .",
    "the output of the low pass filter was used to form a closed loop proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) controller and to maintain constant separation distance between the fiber end and the cantilever during the frequency modulation detection .",
    "the distance was kept constant using a piezoelectric actuator with the pid controller .",
    "now let us consider the detection system .",
    "as mentioned above , the force gradient was measured between an au - coated plate and au - coated sphere attached to the cantilever [ see fig .",
    "in difference with previous experiments , to achieve high resonance frequencies ( and therefore low noise ) hollow glass microspheres and stiffer rectangular si cantilevers were used .",
    "the si cantilevers are conductive , which is necessary for electrical contact to the sphere .",
    "the surfaces of the hollow glass spheres are smooth as they are made from liquid phase .",
    "we followed a special procedure for cleaning the spheres before attachment to the cantilever .",
    "the sphere cleaning procedure removes organic contaminants and debris from the surface .",
    "the first step in the cleaning process was to make a 10ml solution of ethanol into which the spheres were deposited .",
    "this solution was thoroughly mixed in a vortex mixer for about 1 minute .",
    "then , using a pipette , the alcohol was extracted from the solution , leaving the spheres in the vial . to remove strongly attached adsorbates and debris , a 10 ml solution of hydrogen peroxide ( h@xmath4o@xmath4 ) was added to the vial .",
    "a vortex mixer was again used to mix for about 2min .",
    "the o@xmath4 gas released from the solution removed any attached debris from the spheres .",
    "next , the h@xmath4o@xmath4 was extracted with a pipette , and the spheres were immersed in 10ml of ethanol again . to completely separate the debris from the spheres , we centrifuged the alcohol / sphere solution , for 10  minutes . the large radius",
    ", clean hollow spheres float to the top of the mixture and the debris sediment to the bottom .",
    "we used a pipette to remove the spheres at the top and place them in a pyrex petri dish to dry .",
    "the dried spheres were then mounted on the conductive si cantilevers using ag epoxy .",
    "the cantilever - sphere system and a 10 mm in diameter sapphire disk were coated with au in an oil - free thermal evaporator described elsewhere.@xcite the sphere cantilever system was rotated to get a uniform coating .",
    "in contrast to previous experiments only the tip of the cantilever with the sphere was coated with au .",
    "complete coating of the cantilever leads to large decrease in its oscillation q - factor and loss of sensitivity .",
    "the thickness of the au coating was measured to be @xmath18 nm using an afm .",
    "the radius of the sphere was measured to be @xmath19 m using a scanning electron microscope .",
    "thus , the sphere coating was thicker and the sphere radius smaller than in the static afm experiment.@xcite    the cantilever with the sphere was placed in a specially fabricated holder [ see fig .  1(b ) ] containing two piezos ( first connected to the pid loop and the second to the pll ) .",
    "the au plate was mounted on top of a tube piezoelectric actuator from a commercial afm capable of traveling a distance of @xmath20 m .",
    "ohmic contacts were made to the au plate through a 1k@xmath21 resistor . to minimize electrical ground loops all the electrical ground connections were unified to the afm ground .",
    "the calibration of the tube piezoelectric actuator was done using the second interferometer and is described in previous work.@xcite to change the sphere plate distance using the piezoelectric actuator and avoid piezo drift and creep , a continuous 0.01hz triangular voltage signal was applied to the actuator .",
    "the chamber was evacuated using the turbo pump [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] to a pressure of @xmath9torr .",
    "next , the ion pump [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] was turned on and the turbo pump was isolated from the chamber by closing the @xmath22 gate valve .",
    "when chamber reaches @xmath0torr pressure , the experiment was started .",
    "the measurement scheme allowing determination of the gradient of the casimir force is the following . in a dynamic experiment using the frequency shift technique",
    "the total force gradient acting on the cantilever due to interaction of the sphere and plate surfaces modifies the natural resonance frequency of the oscillator . the corresponding change in the frequency @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the resonance frequency in the presence of external force @xmath25",
    ", @xmath26 is the separation between the sphere and the plate , is recorded by the pll .",
    "the total force @xmath25 is the sum of the electrostatic force @xmath27 and the casimir force @xmath28 @xmath29    note that even if no voltage is applied to the au plate and the au sphere is grounded , there is some residual potential difference @xmath30 between the interacting bodies .",
    "this is caused by different connections or work functions of sphere and plate materials from patches and adsorbates on their surfaces . to perform the electrostatic calibrations of our measurement system",
    ", the au coated plate was connected to a voltage supply operating with @xmath31v resolution . then",
    "11 different voltages @xmath32 in the range from 87.4 to 32.6mv were applied to the au plate , while the sphere remained grounded .",
    "starting at the maximum separation , the plate was moved towards the sphere and the corresponding frequency shift was recorded at every 0.14 nm . as was mentioned above",
    ", the sphere - plate force acting on the cantilever causes a change in the resonance frequency . in the linear regime",
    "it is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spring constant of the cantilever .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is an approximate one . in sec .",
    "vi it is obtained from the solution of a more complicated nonlinear problem and the application region of this equation is determined .",
    "the electric force entering eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is expressed as @xmath35 where the function @xmath36 can be written in the form@xcite @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the permittivity of the free space .",
    "for convenience in computations this function can be presented approximately@xcite as the sum of powers @xmath39 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the absolute separation @xmath26 is measured between the zero levels of the roughness on the surfaces of a sphere and a plate ( see sec .",
    "v ) . experimentally the absolute separation is found as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the plate movement due to the piezoelectric actuator and @xmath44 is the point of closest approach between the au sphere and au plate ( note that in this experiment the separation at the closest approach is much larger than the separation on contact of the two surfaces ) .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , one obtains @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here",
    ", the first term on the right - hand side is associated with the gradient of electrostatic force caused by a constant voltage applied to the plate while the sphere remained grounded .",
    "the second term is proportional to the gradient of the casimir force .",
    "below eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is used for the determination of the gradients of the casimir force from the measured data for the frequency shifts .",
    "to determine the gradients of the casimir force from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) one needs to know the precise values of the involved parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath44 .",
    "these can be determined by applying different voltages @xmath32 to the plate and investigating the parabolic dependence of the frequency shift expressed in arbitrary units on @xmath32 .",
    "the calibration procedure requires much care because errors in calibration parameters due , for instance , mechanical drift result in respective errors in the measured casimir force or its gradient .",
    "electrostatic calibrations in measurements of the casimir force have created much discussion in the literature.@xcite specifically , in some cases it was observed@xcite that the residual potential difference @xmath30 depends on separation : @xmath50 .",
    "this was attributed to the probable role of the patch potentials arising due to the polycrystal structure of metallic coatings@xcite or dust and contaminants on the surfaces @xcite ( for a pure coulombian interaction , similar to the applied voltages considered above , @xmath30 is separation - independent ) .",
    "it was even speculated@xcite that patches may render the experimental data@xcite at distances below @xmath31 m compatible with theoretical predictions based on the drude model .",
    "below we present the results of numerical simulation of the electrostatic force due to patch potentials and then describe the electrostatic calibrations .      here , we consider the force arising from a spatial distribution of electrostatic potentials on the surface of an au plate in close proximity to an au sphere for typical parameters of experimental interest .",
    "a realistic variation of the patch potentials was chosen in the range between @xmath51 and 90mv .",
    "this was based on the maximum difference in the workfunctions between the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 crystal orientations of au.@xcite the electrostatic force between the au plate with patches and the grounded au sphere was numerically simulated using 3-dimensional finite element analysis commercial software package ( comsol multiphysics ) .    for this purpose an additional package of the ac / dc module of comsol multiphysics , which is software specifically designed for problems with electrodynamics and electrostatics , was used . the physical system used in the simulation",
    "was drawn with the cad module of comsol multiphysics and the boundary conditions discussed below were assigned .",
    "we first drew a @xmath54 m diameter sphere and @xmath55 plate ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the sphere and plate were placed inside a rectangular box held at constant potential . to represent the patches , square grids of various sizes",
    "were made on the plate .",
    "the size of the grids varied between 300 nm to 6000 nm .",
    "random potentials between 90 to + 90mv were assigned to the patches using a random number generator .",
    "there was no height difference between the patches and the surrounding .",
    "after that , the governing equation , that needs to be solved , with the given boundary conditions was defined .",
    "for the electrostatic force between two metallic objects in vacuum with applied voltages to the plate , the governing equation is the poisson equation : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the relative permittivity set equal to unity and @xmath58 is the potential .",
    "the numerical program solves the electric field and potential at each coordinate in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "it finds the force for a given configuration of potentials on the surfaces .",
    "the force acting on the sphere was obtained by integrating the maxwell stress tensor along the sphere boundary .",
    "the boundary conditions were as follows .",
    "the sphere , and the external box were grounded ( potentials were set equal to zero ) .",
    "the sphere and plate were positioned at some distance @xmath26 .",
    "first the force only due to the patches , @xmath59 , was calculated . here",
    "the potential applied to the plate is kept at zero and only the patches have nonzero potentials .",
    "next , the sphere - plate force for various potentials @xmath58 applied to the plate , @xmath60 , was calculated , when the patch potentials were set to zero .",
    "the value of the applied potential @xmath58 to the plate was varied till @xmath61 .",
    "this value of @xmath58 is equal to @xmath30 , the potential that is necessary to compensate the electrostatic force from the patches .",
    "zero electrostatic sphere - plate force was confirmed for the plate with patches by applying a potential of @xmath30 to the plate .    to achieve the highest resolution in solving the electrostatic problem we used the following parameters for generation of the surface mesh :",
    "1 ) the maximum element size is @xmath62 ; 2 ) maximum element size scaling factor is 1 ; 3 ) element growth rate is 1.2 ; 4 ) mesh curvature factor is 0.2 ; 5 ) mesh curvature cutoff is 0.001 ; 6 ) resolution of narrow regions is 1 . the latter parameter was used to control the number of elements generated in a narrow region . among these parameters , 3)6 )",
    "are very important if a finer mesh is required , especially for complicated objects with sharp , narrow edges or small holes .",
    "now we consider the results of the influence of the random distribution of electrostatic patch potentials on the electrostatic force between the gold sphere and plate .",
    "the investigations were performed for periodic patches with random electrostatic potentials distribution for different sphere - plate separations .",
    "the corresponding compensation voltage @xmath30 when @xmath61 was found at every separation .    in the finite element analysis method the errors mainly result from the discretization of the surface mesh elements .",
    "to obtain the necessary precision and optimize the computation time , the number of mesh elements was restricted to 243122 . to calibrate the simulation , the theoretical force",
    "was compared to that obtained from the numerical simulation . in these checks a uniform plate with no patches was used .",
    "the sphere and plate were placed at 100 nm separation .",
    "the voltage @xmath58 was applied to the plate and the corresponding @xmath60 was found using the numerical simulation .",
    "the value was found to be precise to within 0.23% of the theoretical value .",
    "this was repeated for several sphere - plate separation distances between 501000 nm .",
    "first the role of large patches was studied .",
    "patch sizes of @xmath63 were used on the plate .",
    "the distance between the patches was kept at @xmath64 m .",
    "the residual potentials that will compensate the electrostatic force of the patches were found for sphere - plate separation distances from 50 nm to 1000 nm .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) as solid squares .",
    "the residual potential was found to change as a function of the separation distance .",
    "the change decreases with separation and is very small at 1000 nm even for these @xmath64 m patches .",
    "next the separation distance between the patches was increased to @xmath65 m , while the patch size remained fixed .",
    "the calculations were repeated as before for different sphere - plate separation distances and results are shown as solid circles in fig .",
    "the same exercise was repeated for @xmath66 m distance between the patches and the compensation voltage found is shown as solid triangles in the same figure .",
    "it is clear from the figure that while the values of the compensation potential are different for different separation distances the dependence of @xmath30 on separation is very similar .",
    "this shows that even for these relatively large patches it is possible to obtain a region of separation distance on the order of a micron where the compensation potential is relatively independent of separation distance .",
    "next we investigated the role of smaller patches of size @xmath67 .",
    "the distances between the patches were fixed at 600 nm .",
    "the simulation was repeated and the compensation voltage was found for separation distances between 50 nm and 1000 nm .",
    "the values are shown as solid triangles in fig .",
    "the @xmath30 is found to vary as a function of the separation distance from 9mv to 21mv .",
    "then the patch size was decreased to @xmath68 while the patch - patch distance remained fixed .",
    "the simulations were repeated and the compensation voltage as a function of separation is shown as solid circles in fig .",
    "the smaller patches are seen to lead to smaller @xmath30 which also varies less with separation distance .",
    "the variation seems to be correlated with the patch size and the @xmath30 varies little for separation distances greater than the patch size .",
    "then the patch size was further reduced to @xmath69 and simulations repeated for the same patch - patch distance . for these smaller patches",
    "the plate size was reduced to @xmath70 to optimize the computation time .",
    "the results of the compensation voltages are represented by solid squares in fig .",
    "it is clear that the compensation voltage @xmath30 of the smaller patches have a correspondingly weak dependence on the separation distance .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath69 patches have a @xmath30 which is almost independent of the separation distance particularly above 300 nm .",
    "it should be mentioned that the crystallite sizes observed on the au coated plates used in experiments are even less than 300 nm .",
    "this implies that clean samples where the patch effects originate only from crystallite size should show a @xmath30 that is independent of sphere - plate separation distance .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the values of @xmath30 between 8 and 9mv computed are similar to those observed in experiments .",
    "this lends credence to the notion that the patches present in experiments are of similar size and potential as has been simulated .    at the same time ,",
    "patches or surface contaminants of about @xmath71 m size , like those considered recently@xcite in order to make the experimental data@xcite compatible with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory combined with the drude model , lead to a very strong dependence of @xmath30 on the separation distance at separations up to a few hundred nanometers [ see the upper line marked by solid triangles in fig .",
    "in several experiments@xcite it was experimentally found , however , that @xmath72 over the entire measurement range .",

    "we will return to this point in the next section in connection with our measurements .",
    "now we describe how the parameters of our measurements , @xmath30 , @xmath44 and @xmath49 were determined by means of electrostatic calibrations .",
    "we begin with the determination of @xmath30 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) it can be seen that the frequency shift @xmath73 has a parabolic dependence on the voltage @xmath32 applied to the plate and reaches a maximum at @xmath74 .",

    "the curvature of the parabolas is related to @xmath48 and includes the closest separation and the cantilever parameter @xmath49 .",
    "thus , these parameters can be also extracted from the fit . in order to test for systematic errors in the fitting parameters",
    ", the fitting procedure was repeated many times at different distance ranges .    in the first step , 11 different voltages @xmath32",
    "were applied to the plate and the corresponding frequency shift signal due to the total force gradient was measured .",
    "then , we subtracted any drift of the frequency shift signal . for this purpose",
    "we used the fact that for separations larger than @xmath71 m the total force between the sphere and plate is below the instrumental sensitivity . at these separations ,",
    "the noise is far greater than the signal and in the absence of systematic errors the signal should average to zero",
    ". then the correction due to the drift in sphere - plate separation can be measured .",
    "the effect of the drift can be observed in fig .",
    "4(a ) , where 8 repeated measurements of the frequency shift signal @xmath76 as a function of the sphere - plate separation change @xmath77 are shown for same applied voltage to the plate .",
    "drift causes the separation to increase by around 1 nm in 700s , where 100s correspond to the time taken to make the one measurement [ note that positional precision much better than 1 nm is achieved in this experiment as observed in fig .",
    "4(a ) ] . to calculate the drift rate , the change in position at one frequency shift signal is plotted as a function of time as shown in fig",
    ".  4(b ) .",
    "this was repeated for 15 different signals and the average drift rate was found to be 0.002 nm / s .",
    "the separation distances in all measurements and between subsequent measurements were corrected for this drift rate .",
    "after applying the drift correction the residual potential @xmath30 between the sphere and plate was found .",
    "the frequency shift signals at every 1 nm separation were found by interpolation ( data acquisition was done every 0.14 nm ) . from the parabolic dependence of the electric force gradient shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath30 can be identified at the position of the parabola maxima .",
    "the frequency shift signal was plotted as a function of the applied voltages @xmath32 at every separation and the corresponding @xmath30 and curvature of the parabola @xmath48 were found .",

    "the mean systematic error equal to 0.86mv is shown by the horizontal line . the random error in the mean",
    "@xmath30 averaged over all separations is equal to 0.04mv .",
    "this finally leads to a mean @xmath78mv where the total error of 0.9mv is determined at a 67% confidence level . as can be seen from fig .",
    "5(a ) , the mean @xmath30 is independent of separation over the entire measurement range . to check this observation ,",
    "we have performed the best fit of @xmath30 to the straight line [ see fig .",

    "it was found that the slope is @xmath79mv / nm , i.e. , the independence of @xmath30 on separation was confirmed .",

    "the total error in the mean value of @xmath30 does not influence the systematic error in the measurement scheme with fixed @xmath30 which is mostly determined by instrumental noise ( see sec .",

    "according to our discussion , the patches due to different crystal orientations of the polycrystal sample , surface contaminants and dust may lead to different dependences of @xmath30 on @xmath26 . specifically ,",
    "our simulations show that @xmath30 depends only slightly on @xmath26 for patch sizes smaller than the separation distance .",

    "the influence of this type of patches is automatically taken into account in our measurements either in the value of subtracted electric force or in the value of applied compensating voltage ( see sec .",

    "it also follows that @xmath30 depends heavily on @xmath26 for patch sizes of order or larger than the separation distance . according to fig .",
    "4 , in our experiment @xmath30 remains constant up to @xmath80 nm .",
    "thus , the existence on our plate of patches of more than 2000 nm size discussed in the literature@xcite is incompatible with our measurement data for @xmath30 .",

    "iii , the dependence of @xmath30 on separation was observed in different experiments on the casimir force ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "it might be caused for different reasons including the mechanical drift considered above . in each case",
    "the specific reason can be only determined from a complete analysis of the setup and all the details of that particular experiment .",
    "the next step was to determine the separation distance at closest approach @xmath44 and the coefficient @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "as was explained above , these parameters can be found from the dependence of the parabola curvature @xmath48 on distance @xmath26 . the corresponding theoretical expression for parabola curvature was fit to the measured data for @xmath48 as function of the separation distance .",
    "a least @xmath75-procedure was used in the fitting and the best values of @xmath44 and @xmath49 were obtained .",
    "the fitting procedure was repeated by keeping the start point fixed at the closest separation , while the end point @xmath81 measured from the closest separation was varied from 750 nm to 50 nm . in fig .",
    "6(a ) the @xmath44 so determined is shown as a function of the end point used in the fit .",
    "the systematic errors in the determination of @xmath44 from the fit vary between 0.36 nm and 0.48 nm . in plotting fig .",
    "6(a ) we have included the correction to the mechanical drift of separations , as described above .",
    "the values of @xmath44 are seen to be independent on @xmath81 indicating the absence of errors resulting from @xmath43 calibration .",
    "similarly the value of the coefficient @xmath49 was also extracted by fitting the @xmath48-curve as a function of separation to theoretical expression .",
    "the results obtained after the inclusion of the correction due to mechanical drift are shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) . here , the systematic errors vary between 0.13khzm / n and 0.19khzm / n . the independence on @xmath81 again indicates the absence of errors resulting from @xmath43 calibration .",

    "in this section we present the data obtained for the gradient of the casimir force as a function of separation and determine the random , systematic and total experimental errors .",
    "the data for the gradient of the casimir force are obtained in two ways : with applied compensating voltage and with different applied voltages with subsequent subtraction of the gradient of electric force .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the measured in an earlier experiment.@xcite      to compensate the residual potential difference between the sphere and the plate one should apply to the plate the potential @xmath74 . then the electric force vanishes and from eq .",

    "if computations are performed using the plasma model approach only slightly different maximum amplitudes are allowed .",
    "they are equal to 7.11 , 16.2 , 20.5 , and 33.4 nm at the same respective separations .",
    "note that the use of full eqs .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq28 ] ) opens opportunities for performing measurements in the nonlinear regime . in this case",
    "the immediately measured quantity would be the frequency shift to be compared with theoretical computations using eqs .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) or ( [ eq28 ] ) with different dielectric properties of boundary surfaces .",
    "in the foregoing we have presented the results of precise measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a plate by means of an afm operated in the dynamic regime . from several modifications of dynamic measurements",
    "the most sensitive frequency shift technique has been employed which has never been used before in experiments on the casimir force using an afm .",
    "this was connected with creation of significantly different setup adapted for dynamic measurements , use of higher vacuum and hollow glass microspheres of smaller radius .",
    "special attention was devoted to electrostatic calibrations of the setup , i.e. , to a problem which created much discussion in previous literature .",
    "we have addressed in much detail both the problem of electrostatic patches and contaminants on the surface and the problem of dependence of the calibration parameters on separation between the test bodies .",
    "it is well known that many different models of patches were discussed in the literature leading to varying predictions of additional electrostatic forces from large@xcite to negligibly small.@xcite to address this problem , we performed numerical simulation of the electrostatic force due to the patch potentials and have shown that for both relatively small and large patches the residual potential between the sphere and the plate would be separation - dependent for patch sizes of order or larger than the separation .",
    "this adds importance to the second problem , i.e. , to the separation - dependence of the calibration parameters .",
    "experimental investigation of this problem demonstrated that the calibration parameters are constant if the corrections to mechanical drift are introduced .",
    "our measurement data for electric forces unequivocally exclude the predicted@xcite large electrostatic force from the polycrystal structure of au coatings . on the other hand",
    ", the observed independence of the residual potential difference on separation rejects the hypothesis@xcite of large contaminants on the surface , which could decrease significantly the enormously large effect of a polycrystal structure , but , as follows from our simulations , lead to the separation - dependent residual potential .",
    "these findings are in line with the fact that the surfaces of the au - coated sphere and the plate in our experiment have been subjected to a multistep cleaning procedure and would be unlikely to have large contaminants .",
    "thus , our conclusion is that the experimental data are in favor of the model of patches proposed previously.@xcite    it should be stressed that the mean gradient of the casimir force as a function of separation has been measured in our experiment in two independent ways ( with applied compensating voltage and with applied different voltages to the plate with subsequent subtraction of electric forces ) .",
    "the obtained results were found in excellent agreement in the limits of total experimental errors .",
    "the latter were determined as combinations of random and systematic errors at a 67% confidence level .",
    "the mean measured gradients of the casimir force were converted into the pressure between two parallel plates and compared with respective results measured in the most precise experiment performed by means of micromachined oscillator.@xcite the mean casimir pressures determined in both experiments were found in excellent agreement over the entire measurement range .    the mean measured gradients of the casimir force were compared with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory with no fitting parameters . in so doing two theoretical approaches proposed in the literature were used based on the drude and plasma models of dielectric permittivity .",
    "the contribution of surface roughness was calculated to be less than 0.13% of the force gradients .",
    "the measured data were shown to be consistent with theoretical results obtained using the generalized plasma - like model over the entire measurement range .",
    "theoretical predictions computed using the drude model approach were excluded by the data over the separation region from 235 to 420 nm at a 67% confidence level with measurements at every nanometer .",
    "the nonlinear regime of our oscillator was investigated , and the linearity in the region of used experimental parameters was confirmed .",
    "it is pertinent to note that one experiment alone performed at a 67% confidence level would be not enough to falsify application in casimir physics of a well tested and commonly used theoretical model . in this",
    "regard our experiment should be considered as an additional independent argument to more precise experiments ( up to 99.9% confidence level ) performed using another experimental technique.@xcite    the main result on the exclusion of the drude model by the data deserves special discussion .",
    "it is common knowledge that response of metallic materials to real electromagnetic fields is correctly described by the drude model , whereas the plasma model is only an approximation valid in the region of sufficiently high frequencies .",
    "experiments using a micromachined oscillator@xcite demonstrated that in the lifshitz theory not the drude but the plasma model is supported by the data .",
    "thereafter many attempts were undertaken to rule out this conclusion .",
    "this is the reason why one more experiment , using an alternative laboratory setup , is highly desirable . in our experiment , using a dynamic afm in a frequency modulation technique , we confirmed the results of previous measurements performed by means of a micromachined oscillator .",
    "we also addressed the problem of patch potentials , independence of the calibration parameters on separation and applicability of the linear regime of the dynamic afm .",
    "in addition , an independent comparison between experiment and theory beyond the pfa has been made with no fitting parameters .",
    "nevertheless the drude model approach was again excluded by the data .",
    "one can conclude that the exclusion of this approach to a theoretical description of the casimir interaction between metallic surfaces received a more complete experimental confirmation . keeping in mind similar experiments with semiconductor and dielectric test bodies discussed in sec .",
    "i , a thorough analysis of all the assumptions in the basics of the lifshitz theory seems pertinent .",
