    "the first dozen of years in the 21st century may be recognized as the starting point of the exotic hadron renaissance . in textbooks ,",
    "hadrons are explained as @xmath3 ( mesons ) or @xmath4 ( baryons ) composites , and many of the hadron masses are well described in the quark model .",
    "this common understanding of hadrons becomes doubtful in these years .",
    "starting from @xmath5  @xcite , we have found many hadronic states which we can not understand in the nave quark model .",
    "for example , a penta quark state @xmath6 is claimed to be observed at leps  @xcite , while its existence is still controversial  @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is a typical and clear exotic hadron  @xcite : its mass is close to @xmath8 threshold and we expect it contains @xmath9 , and it has a positive charge .",
    "thus the minimum quark content of @xmath7 is @xmath10 .",
    "understanding the structure of exotic hadrons is important in order to construct a new scheme over the quark model to categorize hadrons including normal and exotic ones .",
    "there are mainly two - types of structure considered for exotic hadrons .",
    "one of them is compact multi - quark structure , and the other is hadronic molecule structure .",
    "these two types of structure would have different sizes .",
    "we expect that a multi - quark state has a similar size to normal hadrons , while the deuteron , a well - known hadronic molecule , has a much larger size than normal hadrons .",
    "another aspect of exotic hadron physics is that it is related to the hadron - hadron interaction .",
    "the existence of @xmath11 below the @xmath12 threshold leads to various aspects of @xmath12 interaction .",
    "similarly , once the pole position of the @xmath13 dibaryon ( @xmath14 ) is fixed , @xmath0 interaction is strongly constrained .",
    "high energy heavy ion collisions would provide unique information on exotic hadron structure and hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "various hadrons are produced abundantly in heavy ion collisions , and it is natural to expect that exotic hadrons are also produced .",
    "the dynamics of high energy heavy ion collisions is so complex that statistical argument becomes valid ; we may dare to say , heavy - ion collisions are simple and clean . via the hadron - hadron correlation measurement",
    ", it is in principle possible to extract the resonance pole above the strong decay threshold .    in this proceedings ,",
    "we discuss the exotic hadron structure and hadron - hadron interaction in view of heavy - ion collisions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exhic ] , we demonstrate that the production yield is sensitive to hadron size . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ll ] , we discuss @xmath0  correlation and its relation to @xmath0  interaction .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed so far to gain energy in exotic states .",
    "based on the diquark picture and color - magnetic interaction , exotic hadron states including heavy - quarks should exist in some channels .",
    "the color - magnetic interaction is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the quark mass .",
    "then in a state made of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 denotes a heavy quark ) , a diquark @xmath19 component would be favored rather than a mesonic molecule component @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is one of theoretically proposed hadronic states made of @xmath22  @xcite . since the strong decay to @xmath23",
    "is forbidden by the angular momentum conservation and its predicted mass is lower than the @xmath24 , @xmath25 may have a small width",
    ". a hadronic molecular state with the same quantum number is also predicted in the pion - exchange model  @xcite .",
    "the pion couples @xmath26 and @xmath27 states and pseudo - scalar and vector meson masses are close with heavy - quarks ( heavy - quark symmetry ) , then the two `` states '' ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) couple strongly and @xmath25 can gain energy .",
    "it is a challenge to clarify the structure and mechanism for each of the exotic states to exist .",
    "one of the key quantity to distinguish a multi - quark state and a hadronic molecule state is the size : when it is a multi - quark state such as a diquark pair @xmath19 , the confining force between the diquarks would make the system compact . when it is a hadronic molecule such as a @xmath28 bound state , the exotic hadron size would be determined by its binding energy or the range of the pion - exchange .",
    "recent work on @xmath11 sheds light on this idea  @xcite .",
    "they have proposed that the evidence of the @xmath12 picture of @xmath11 may be found in the negatively large squared charge radius , which may be observed in the electric form factor .",
    "we have proposed that we can utilize high - energy heavy - ion collisions to obtain knowledges on the exotic hadron size  @xcite . at rhic and lhc ,",
    "abundant hadrons are produced and their yield ratio is well described by the statistical model , which assumes thermal equilibrium at freeze - out  @xcite . we expect the statistical model also works for the exotic hadron production , which is calculated to be frequent enough .",
    "one of the problems of the statistical model is its prediction power for resonance states . for example , the statistical model overestimates the yield of @xmath30 by a factor of two or more .",
    "this discrepancy is explained based on the coalescence ( recombination ) model , which uses the internal wave function thus includes the angular momentum effects  @xcite .",
    "since the reaction time at rhic and lhc is not very long , it may not be reasonable to understand the equilibrium hadron production literally and we may need underlying hadron production mechanisms which result in statistical distribution of ground state hadrons .     as a function of mass ( left ) and @xmath31 ( right ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]   as a function of mass ( left ) and @xmath31 ( right ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]    in order to discuss the production mechanism dependence , we compare the results of the coalescence model and the statistical model at rhic and lhc . we adopt the setup proposed by chen and his collaborators  @xcite .",
    "hadron yields in statistical model , @xmath32 are obtained at the transition ( hadronization ) temperature @xmath33 and volume @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the degeneracy , fugacity , and chemical potential of the hadron @xmath38 .",
    "light quarks ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are considered to reach approximate chemical equilibrium .",
    "since charm and bottom quarks are produced from initial hard scattering and their numbers are much larger than the equilibrium values , we put the fugacity @xmath41 for hadrons which contains charm and bottom quarks .",
    "we have fixed the fugacity of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks to reproduce the expected number of charm and bottom quark number from initial hard scattering .",
    "the yield of a hadron @xmath38 in the coalescence model is given as , @xmath42      f_w(x_1 , \\cdots , x_n ; p_1 , \\cdots , p_n ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\simeq & \\frac{g_hv(m\\omega)^{3/2}}{(4\\pi)^{3/2 } }      \\frac{(2t/\\omega)^l}{(1 + 2t/\\omega)^{n+l-1 } }      \\prod_{j=1}^n \\frac{n_j ( 4\\pi)^{3/2}}{g_j v(m_j\\omega)^{3/2 } }      \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1 } \\frac{(2 l_i ) ! ! } { ( 2l_i+1 ) ! ! } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the wigner function of the constituents and the intrinsic states , respectively , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the temperature and volume at coalescence , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the degeneracy , yield and mass of the @xmath50-th constituent ( hadron or quark ) , @xmath51 is the sum of constituent masses , and @xmath52 denotes the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath53-th jacobi coordinate and their sum is @xmath54 .",
    "coalescence model calculations are performed at the hadronization temperature @xmath55 and the freeze - out temperature @xmath56 for the quark and hadronic coalescence , respectively . we have assumed a harmonic oscillator wave functions , whose frequency is given as @xmath57 for hadrons made of @xmath58 and @xmath59 quarks .",
    "for hadrons containing strange , charm and bottom quarks , we fit the statistical model results of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 and obtain @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcs ] , we show the ratio of the hadron yields in the coalescence and statistical models , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes the hadron yields per unit rapidity in the coalescence or statistical model .",
    "first , we note that the ratio for normal hadrons ( open triangles ) is in the range of @xmath67 ( gray band ) . here",
    "`` normal '' hadrons are defined as particle states considered to be made of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for mesons and baryons , respectively ; lowest mass states for given quantum numbers ( @xmath68 and flavor ) of pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath69 ) , vector mesons ( @xmath70 ) , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 baryons .",
    "we also categorize @xmath73 and @xmath74 as normal hadrons .",
    "secondly , the coalescence model is found to predict smaller yields of compact multi - quark states .",
    "when we use the same hadron size parameter as that of normal hadrons , an addition of a @xmath40-wave , @xmath75-wave , or @xmath59-quark leads to a suppression factor of 0.36 , 0.093 , or 0.029 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "thus compact multi - quark states are suppressed  @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature found in the coalescence - statistical ratios is the enhancement of spatially extended hadronic molecules .",
    "let us consider the two - body @xmath40-wave coalescence in isotropic environment .",
    "the coalescence yield is given as the convolution of the intrinsic wigner function and the thermal distribution of the relative coordinate , @xmath76^{-d/2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is the width in the intrinsic wigner function in the spatial ( momentum ) coordinate , @xmath79 is the reduced mass , and @xmath45 is the temperature at coalescence .",
    "we have assumed here the spatial gaussian source with the radius @xmath80 . when the minimum uncertainty @xmath81 is assumed , the above yield shows a maximum when the spatial - to - momentum width ratio of the intrinsic wigner function is the same as that of the source , which reads @xmath82 . as an example , in the case of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , the optimal value of the oscillator frequency is @xmath86 , which is much smaller than that of normal hadrons , @xmath87 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rcs ] , we show the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath88 . in the present calculation",
    ", we have assumed that the source size is large enough .",
    "these results include three - body hadronic molecules , but the trend is the same .",
    "the coalescence favors hadrons whose shape in the phase space is similar to that of the source , then the large source size and moderate @xmath45 prefer extended hadrons in coalescence .    if the coalescence is the underlying mechanism of the statistical model , the coalescence model would give better predictions of the hadron yields including resonances and exotic hadrons , and we can utilize high - energy heavy - ion collisions as a ruler of the hadron size ; smaller and larger yields for compact multi - quark states and spatially extended hadronic molecule states , respectively .",
    "where is the @xmath13 dibaryon , @xmath14 ? this is a long standing problem in hadron physics . in 1977 , jaffe pointed out that double strange dibaryon made of 6 quarks ( @xmath89 ) may be deeply bound below the @xmath0 threshold due to the strong attraction from color magnetic interaction  @xcite .",
    "dedicated experiments have been performed to find the @xmath14 particle in these 35 years .",
    "deeply bound @xmath14 was denied by the observation of double @xmath90 hypernuclei .",
    "for example , a double @xmath90 hypernucleus @xmath91 was found to decay weakly in the nagara event , and the observed energy of @xmath91 is @xmath92 below the @xmath93 threshold  @xcite .",
    "if the mass of @xmath14 is below @xmath94 , @xmath91 should decay to @xmath95 strongly .",
    "the reason why the attraction is weaker than expected may be the determinant - type 3-quark interaction  @xcite , which is repulsive in the @xmath14 channel  @xcite .",
    "while the deeply bound @xmath14 is denied , the attraction in the @xmath14 channel may generate a pole in the weakly bound or resonance region .",
    "there are some hints in recent experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the kek - e522 experiment observed a bump in the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "recent lattice qcd studies imply that @xmath14 should exist as a bound state in the su(3 ) limit and/or with heavy pion masses  @xcite .",
    "thus the physics of the @xmath14 particle is a long - standing as well as current problem .",
    "existence of the @xmath14 particle state is closely related to the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the @xmath14 particle pole is , if exists , near the @xmath0  threshold , and it is natural to expect that @xmath14 contains a significant component of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0  interaction is important also for the dense matter equation of state ( eos ) . in many of theoretical calculations ,",
    "@xmath90 fraction in dense neutron star matter is compatible with the neutron fraction , then the strength of the @xmath0  interaction may affect the eos .",
    "until now , available information on @xmath0  interaction is scarce .",
    "we know that it is weakly attractive from the @xmath0  bond energy in @xmath91 , @xmath96 . from @xmath97 , the scattering length and the effective range in the @xmath0  @xmath98 channel",
    "are obtained as @xmath99  @xcite or @xmath100  @xcite , but in principle we can not determine two low energy scattering parameters from one observed value of @xmath101 .",
    "thus other observational information on @xmath0  interaction has been desired .",
    "one of the ways is to observe the binding energies of various double @xmath90 hypernuclei , as planned in the j - parc e07 experiment .",
    "another available observable is the @xmath0  correlation in nuclear reactions .",
    "actually , kek - e522 experiment  @xcite has demonstrated that @xmath0  invariant mass spectrum is enhanced in the low energy region compared with the phase space estimate and the classical transport model calculation , implying that @xmath0  interaction is attractive . in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "abundant @xmath90 particles are produced , and we can measure the @xmath0  relative momentum correlation , which contains information on @xmath0  interaction .",
    "this idea is not new .",
    "it was proposed in 80s that we can fix resonance parameters , when the source size is small  @xcite .",
    "the correlation at low relative momenta was proposed to be useful to discriminate the sign of the scattering length @xmath102 , provided that the source size is large  @xcite ; when @xmath0  has a bound state ( @xmath103 ) , the scattering wave function must have a node at @xmath104 in order to be orthogonal to the bound state wave function , then we may find the suppression of the correlation .",
    "now rhic and lhc have the vertex detectors , and we can really obtain the @xmath0  correlation data in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we here discuss @xmath0  correlation in heavy ion collisions in view of @xmath0  interaction .",
    "two particle correlation at low relative momentum from a chaotic source is known to be sensitive to the source size and the two particle interaction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0  correlation function is given as , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the relative wave function having the relative momentum @xmath107 in the final state , @xmath108 is the relative wave function in the @xmath109wave , and @xmath110 denotes the source function . in obtaining the second line ,",
    "we have made following two approximations .",
    "( 1 ) the single particle source function has a gaussian profile whose width is independent of momentum , then the source function in the relative coordinate is given as @xmath111 . ( 2 ) only the @xmath109wave relative wave function is modified from the free case by the @xmath0  interaction .",
    "interaction models . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]    the correlation function is determined by the source function and the relative wave function , the latter of which is sensitive to the @xmath0  interaction .",
    "we compare the results with several types of @xmath0  interactions .",
    "the first type of @xmath0  interactions is the nijmegen models  @xcite , which are based on a meson and meson - pair exchange picture of baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "the second type of baryon - baryon interaction is the quark model interaction fss2  @xcite , which takes account of the pauli blocking at the quark level , gluon exchanges between quarks , and meson exchanges .",
    "we also compare the results of a one - boson exchange @xmath0  interaction , ehime potential  @xcite .",
    "since the ehime potential is proposed before the nagara event , it assumes a smaller @xmath0  bond energy , @xmath112 , than that obtained in the nagara event . in actual calculations ,",
    "we use two range gaussian potentials which fit the scattering length and effective range for nijmegen and ehime potentials . for fss2",
    ", we use a phase - shift equivalent local potential , derived by using the inversion method based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : size ] , we show the source size dependence of the @xmath0  correlation @xmath114 .",
    "calculated results using fss2 , as an example , are compared with the rhic - star data  @xcite .",
    "when the source size is small , @xmath115 has a long tail in the high momentum region .",
    "thus we can obtain the source size by fitting the correlation at high momenta .",
    "the optimal source radius @xmath80 depends on the @xmath0  interaction , but the data suggest that the apparent source size of @xmath90 is around @xmath116 , which is smaller than the pion and kaon source",
    ". this difference may be due to the flow effects . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] , we show the size dependence of the @xmath0  correlation with flow effects .",
    "transverse flow generally extends the range of finite correlation to a higher momentum region . extending the correlation to higher",
    "momentum means that the flow makes the apparent radius smaller than the actual source size .",
    "we find that the @xmath90 source size may be in the range @xmath117 when we take a reasonable flow parameter @xmath118 ( the transverse rapidity is given as @xmath119 ) .",
    "this source size would be consistent with the proton source size .",
    "after fitting the tail region , we can discriminate the @xmath0  interaction from the behavior of @xmath114 at small @xmath120 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hll ] , we compare the results from several @xmath0  interactions .",
    "it seems that nijmegen model d ( nd ) with the hard core radius of @xmath121 , nijmegen soft - core 97 model ( nsc97f ) , and quark model interaction ( fss2 ) are consistent with the rhic - star data .",

    "the feeddown effects have been known to be decisive for the @xmath123 correlation .",
    "the @xmath123 correlation at low momentum is suppressed by the coulomb repulsion , and the gamow factor correction recovers @xmath114 to be around unity . in high - energy heavy - ion collisions",
    ", we have protons also from the decay of heavier particles , such as @xmath124 .",
    "there is no coulomb suppression in the @xmath125 channel , and the pionic weak decay does not change the baryon momentum much . as a result ,",
    "@xmath125 correlation in the reaction region strongly affects the @xmath123 correlation .",
    "compared with the @xmath123 correlation , the feeddown effects on the @xmath0  correlation are expected to be small .",
    "there is no coulomb suppression in the @xmath0  channel , and the particles which decays into @xmath90 are limited .",

    "there exists an exception , @xmath127 , which we can not exclude experimentally .",

    "we have discussed the exotic hadron size and hadron - hadron interactions in terms of the hadron yield and hadron - hadron correlation in heavy ion collisions .    in the first part , we have demonstrated that heavy ion collisions may play a role of the hadron size ruler : in the framework of the coalescence model , a hadron with a large size would be produced more abundantly compared with the statistical model result .",
    "the mechanism of this enhancement is argued in a simple two body coalescence case , and we have found that coalescence favors hadrons whose shape in the phase space is similar to that of the source . if this coalescence mechanism also applies to other reactions , the yield of compact multi - quark states may be larger than the statistical model result in @xmath141 reaction",
    ". thus it will be valuable to investigate exotic hadron production in @xmath141 collisions .",
    "we have assumed that the source size is large enough in heavy - ion collisions , but it is necessary to take account of the finite size effects in @xmath141 , where the source size would be compatible with the hadron size .    in the second part , we have discussed the @xmath0  interaction and its effects on the @xmath0  correlation , which is recently measured at rhic  @xcite . based on a gaussian source assumption and by considering the decay effects of @xmath127 , we have compared the data with calculated results using several types of @xmath0  interaction .",
