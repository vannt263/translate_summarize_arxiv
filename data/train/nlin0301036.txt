    "charge transport in dna is an interesting subject because of its role for biological functions such as dna repair after radiation damage and biosynthesis , and , on the other hand , because of the possibility of building electronic devices based on biomaterials  @xcite .",
    "when a charge moves along the double dna strand it is accompanied by a local deformation of the molecule , forming a polaron .",
    "simple , but powerful models of dna are based on the one proposed by peyrard ",
    "bishop @xcite , in which the only variables are the distances between bases within each base pair .",
    "the corresponding hydrogen bonds are described by morse potentials . in the context of polaron dynamics ,",
    "a tight  binding system coupled with the bond distances is used for the description of the charge dynamics . in this case , as the deformation of the helix is small a harmonic approximation of the bond potentials is considered enough giving rise to a holstein model  @xcite .    however , the helical structure of dna is thought to play a key role in its functional processes and recently steric models of the molecule",
    "have been introduced in the context of vibrational motion  @xcite and charge transport  @xcite . as it will be shown in this article , the value of the parameter @xmath0 that couples the electronic transfer integral and the distance between nucleotides is of particular importance , determining to a great extent the degree of charge localization and its mobility properties .",
    "however there is no experimental evidence of its value .",
    "previous works  @xcite have dealt with very small values of @xmath0 , because the angular deformations of the helix had to be small in compliance with the linear approximations performed in the expressions of the distances between nucleotides .",
    "one conclusion of these works are that charge transport in dna is mediated by coupling of the charge carrying unit with the hydrogen ",
    "bond deformations , and that this transport survives to a small amount of parametric and structural disorder . however , we show in this work , taking into account the full equations of the model , that for larger values of @xmath0 a completely different regime appears . in this regime charge transport",
    "is mediated by local winding and unwinding of the helix . moreover ,",
    "this regime is more robust with respect to disorder than the one mediated by the coupling with the hydrogen  bond distances .",
    "in order to describe the dynamic of a dna chain , we consider a variant of the _ twist - opening _ model  @xcite , which itself is a modification of the peyrard  bishop model taking into account the helical structure of the molecule and the torsional deformations induced by the opening of the base pairs .",
    "each group of sugar , nucleotide and base will be considered as a single , non ",
    "deformable object , with mass @xmath1 , which is an averaged estimation of the nucleotide mass .",
    "as we are interested in base pair vibrations and not in acoustic motions , we fix the center of mass of each base pair , @xmath2 , the two bases in a base pair are constrained to move symmetrically with respect to the molecule axis . moreover , the distances between two neighboring base pair planes shall be treated as fixed , because in the axial direction dna seems less deformable than within the base pair planes  @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "all bond potentials will be treated as harmonic ones .",
    "this can be justified because charge transport is related with small deformations of the double chain .",
    "furthermore , as the angular twist and the radial vibrational motion evolve on two different time scales , they can be considered as decoupled degrees of freedom in the harmonic approximation  @xcite .",
    "thus , the position of the n  th base pair is represented by the variables @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the radial displacement of the base pair from the equilibrium value @xmath5 , and @xmath6 its angular displacement from equilibrium angles with respect to a fixed external reference frame .",

    "although this method does not guarantee mobility , it nevertheless proves to be successful in a wide parameter range .      in absence of diagonal disorder , and if the parameter @xmath0 is small enough ( @xmath108 ) , it is not possible to move the polarons by perturbing the angular variables .",

    "the charge probability moves with uniform velocity along the lattice with apparently constant profile .",
    "the movement of the charge is accompanied by a relatively large radial deformation ( @xmath109 ) and a negligible angular lattice deformation ( @xmath110 ) .",

    "perturbations of the radial variables can not activate mobility .",
    "this is a consequence of the different contributions of the radial and angular components in the discrete gradient .     and an initial kick @xmath117 in the angular velocities , corresponding to a kinetic energy of the perturbation @xmath118 ev .

    "the charge probability apparently moves with constant velocity and constant profile .",
    "2 .   there are relatively large radial and angular deformations travelling with the charge ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) .",
    "the velocity of the polaron increases initially with the kinetic energy of the perturbation but tends to be approximately constant , as fig .",
    "[ ve_o ] shows .",
    "it decreases slowly with @xmath0 .",
    "this moving excitation remains localized even for large perturbations .",
    "there remains a small radial oscillation localized at the starting site .",
    "also an angular deformation travels with opposite direction and phase than the angular pulse moving with the charge .     added to the ground state in the ordered case .",
    "squares correspond to the radial movability regime ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "circles correspond to the mixed regime with radial activation ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "triangles correspond to the mixed regime with angular activation for the same value of @xmath123 .",
    "stars correspond to the twist movability regime ( @xmath124 ) . ]",
    "it is possible , for intermediates values of the parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath125 ) , that the polaron can become mobile by perturbing any set of variables , the radial or the angular ones .",
    "nevertheless , the movement is rather different as shown in fig  [ ve_o ] , when the polaron propagation is activated by means of radial perturbations , its characteristics are similar to the radial movability regimen , and likewise when it is activated by angular perturbations .",
    "in general , radial movability requires less energy and has higher velocity than the angular one , as shown in fig .",
    "there exists a small interval of perturbations energies , for which the movement can be activated by means of both kind of perturbations .",
    "the velocities obtained are similar but the evolution of the spatial variables are rather different .",
    "it is worth remarking that the limits of these regimes are not exact , depending on the kinetic energy of the perturbation , but we have intended to present a general picture .",
    "the consequences for the tail analysis of the radial movability regime has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we use this simple but useful instrument to perform a similar study of the twist movability regime .",
    "the tails of the moving polaron have small amplitude and therefore their dynamics is to a great extent linear .",
    "the linear equations corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ electron]-[angular ] ) in the ordered case are : @xmath126 according to these equations , the variables @xmath4 are driven by the nonlinear terms and we will not consider them here .",
    "we propose the moving tail modes @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which will be valid ( relatively ) far from the head of the moving polaron and while @xmath129 .",
    "these modes comply with the observed phenomena of similar exponential decay for @xmath130 and @xmath6 and that the second magnitude is a deformation and not an oscillation .",
    "substitution into the first and third equations leads to : @xmath131 the velocity in physical units is @xmath132 .",
    "the inverse characteristic length can be related to the participation number by @xmath133 certainly @xmath134 and @xmath98 are determined by the full linear equations and depend on @xmath0 , but in this way we can relate the values of @xmath134 with the numerical results for @xmath98 . within the twist movability regime the values of @xmath98 change from 5 to 12 , which correspond to values for @xmath134 , 0.74 and 0.33 , and for @xmath135 , 3.17 and 3.11 ( @xmath136 ) , respectively . for @xmath134",
    "small , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the numerical results vary from 2.1 to 3.4 , i.e. , they are in good agreement with the values of this tail analysis , taking into account the drastic simplification of the model . moreover , they are also coherent with the numerical observation that the velocity of the polarons practically does not depend on the kinetic energy of the perturbation , as fig .",
    "[ ve_o ] shows .",
    "the conclusion is that in this regime the polaron is basically _ riding _ on the angular wave .",
    "equations ( [ eq : linpol ] ) can be used to obtain the wave number @xmath140 and the charge energy @xmath89 and to compare them with the numerical data with good results , with @xmath141 and energies slightly below @xmath142 ( scaled units ) .",
    "this last value corresponds to the extended ground state with @xmath143 and @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "if an amount of disorder in the on  site energies @xmath92 is introduced , with random values @xmath145 , we find that moving polarons exist below a critical value @xmath146 . beyond this value polarons",
    "can not be moved as found in ref .",
    "the most relevant results are :    1 .   in the radial movability regime",
    ", mobility is very sensitive to disorder .",
    "only a small degree of disorder allows activation of polaron motion ( e.g. , if @xmath122 , @xmath147 ev ) .",
    "2 .   in the twist movability regime",
    "the moving polaron is very robust with respect to disorder ( e.g. , if @xmath124 , @xmath148 ev ) .",
    "3 .   for the mixed regime",
    ", angular activation leads to more robust ( but slower ) polarons than radial activation .",
    "if @xmath94 is high enough , only angular activation is possible .",
    "the movement is very similar to the ordered case .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the influence of the radial and angular perturbations on the properties of moving polarons in a three  dimensional , semi  classical , tight ",
    "binding model for dna in both the ordered and disordered case .",
    "there exist three different regimes depending on the parameter @xmath0 that describes the coupling of the transfer integrals with the deformations of the hydrogen bonds : a )  radial movability , with charge transport activated only by perturbing the radial variables ; b )  twist movability , with charge transport activated by angular perturbations ; c )  mixed regime .",
    "the properties of the moving polarons are different in each regime . in general , the mobility induced by angular activation is more robust with respect to parametric disorder , the polarons have lower velocity , and the activation energies are higher than in the radial movability regime .    we have found that charge transport along the dna chain is strongly influenced by the value of @xmath0 . therefore , experimental observations of charge transport in real dna could help to determine this crucial magnitude , which , in turn , is necessary to understand the phenomenon of charge transport in dna .",
