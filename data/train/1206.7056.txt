    "monochromatic gamma - ray lines have been suggested long ago as signature for pair - annihilation of dark matter ( dm ) particles @xcite . during the past decades many dm candidates",
    "have been discussed , the most popular ones being weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the context of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "more recently , also decaying dark matter has been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of decaying gravitino dark matter is the consistency with thermal leptogenesis , contrary to standard wimp dark matter @xcite .    during the past years",
    "the large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite , on board the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , has searched with unprecedented sensitivity for photon lines from 30  mev to 300  gev .",
    "stringent constraints on decaying and annihilating dark matter have been obtained from searches in the energy range @xmath0  gev based on 11 months of data  @xcite , and in the range @xmath1  gev based on 23 months of data  @xcite .",
    "the search region used in these analyses covers the whole sky except for the galactic disk ( @xmath2 ) plus a @xmath3 region around the galactic center .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed independently based on publicly available data corresponding to 27 months in ref .",
    "no indications for gamma - ray lines were found .    in a recent analysis ,",
    "that is based on optimized search regions around the galactic center , and takes 43 months of fermi - lat data into account , a hint for a gamma - ray feature in the energy range @xmath4  gev is reported  @xcite . when interpreted in terms of a gamma - ray line  @xcite , the significance obtained from the statistical uncertainties in the search regions close to the galactic center is @xmath5 .",
    "the significance is reduced to @xmath6 when correcting for the bias introduced by selecting the search regions .",
    "while the excess is currently under an active debate  @xcite , the claim has been further strengthened by a recent analysis  @xcite , which confirms the existence of an excess , as well as its spectral shape , with even higher statistical significance than the one claimed in ref .",
    "in addition , indications are found that the excess originates from a relatively narrow region of a few degrees around the galactic center , possibly with a small offset within the galactic plane .",
    "hopefully , the question about the existence of the spectral feature and its precise properties will be settled in the near future .",
    "assuming that the feature is real , the question about its origin is of great interest .",
    "while an astrophysical explanation might eventually be identified , a spectral feature in this energy range can arise rather generically from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles . in this paper",
    "we compare decaying and annihilating dark matter based on two prototype models : decaying gravitinos and wino / higgsino - like wimps which annihilate predominantly into two w - bosons . in both cases",
    "we treat the branching ratios into @xmath7 ( gravitino ) and @xmath8 ( wino / higgsino ) final states as free parameters to account for some model dependence .",
    "note that we do not demand thermal freeze - out for wimps .",
    "higgsinos and winos can be nonthermally produced in gravitino decays , compatible with leptogenesis @xcite , or , alternatively , in moduli decays  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall compare interpretations of the tentative 130  gev photon line in terms of decaying and annihilating dark matter in a sequence of increasing assumptions : we first consider constraints from continuum gamma - rays , which are independent of charged cosmic rays and the dark matter distribution ( section  2 ) .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of constraints from antiprotons , which depend on the propagation model ( section  3 ) .",
    "we then analyze the implications of the spatial distribution of the fermi - lat excess ( section  4 ) and draw our conclusions ( section  5 ) .",
    "since the dark matter particle is required to be electrically neutral , the annihilation or decay into photons is typically suppressed compared to channels involving for example electroweak gauge bosons or the higgs boson , as well as quarks or leptons . the subsequent decay and fragmentation of these annihilation or decay products",
    "gives rise , among others , to an emission of gamma rays with a broad spectrum in the energy range @xmath9 gev below the line .",
    "therefore , one expects that the line flux is accompanied by an associated continuum flux with the same spatial distribution , whose strength depends on the relative size of the annihilation or decay rates into photons and into other standard model particles . as compared to the sharp feature resulting from the direct decay into photons , the continuum emission has a less characteristic spectral shape and is therefore much harder to disentangle from the background gamma - ray flux in the galactic center region  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "one expects a much larger total flux in the continuum compared to the line , and therefore it is important to check up to which level a continuum emission is acceptable . apart from the center of the galaxy , the continuum flux of gamma rays can be constrained , _ e.g. _ , by the emission seen within the galactic halo  @xcite , from galaxy clusters  @xcite , or from dwarf galaxies  @xcite . in general",
    ", a comparison of the various constraints from different targets is affected by the uncertainties related to the dark matter density distribution in the different environments .",
    "we will not enter into the details of this discussion here , but instead follow a very conservative approach .",
    "namely , we consider the same data sets for the photon flux that have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to search for a gamma - ray line signal .",
    "however , instead of using only a line as the template , we add a contribution from the continuum flux , and test whether the combined spectrum yields a satisfactory fit to the data .",
    "this strategy has the advantage that it is not affected by uncertainties related to the actual dark matter distribution , because both the line and the continuum fluxes are generated from the same source .",
    "concretely , we consider a spectral template for the fit given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for dark matter annihilation ( decay ) .",
    "the spectrum of secondary photons originating from the decay and fragmentation of quarks , leptons or electroweak gauge bosons produced in annihilation or decay processes is denoted by @xmath14 , while @xmath15 denotes the extragalactic contribution resulting from the superposition of redshifted photons  @xcite .",
    "both will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath16 determines the strength of the dark matter flux .",
    "the background is assumed to follow a power law within the considered energy range ( see  @xcite for possible caveats ) .",
    "both the normalization @xmath17 and the slope @xmath18 of the background @xmath19 are taken as fit parameters . for a given dark matter profile and search region ,",
    "@xmath16 can be easily converted into the dark matter annihilation cross section @xmath20 or partial lifetime @xmath21 into monochromatic photons .",
    "the continuum spectrum is in general given by the sum of two components .",
    "the first one arises from redshifted monochromatic photons with extragalactic origin .",
    "for decaying dark matter it is given by  @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 are the cosmological density parameters , assuming a spatially flat @xmath24cdm model , @xmath25 is the dark matter density , @xmath26km / s / mpc is the hubble constant with @xmath27 , @xmath28gev/@xmath29 is the critical density , @xmath30 is the speed of light , and the factor @xmath31 appears because of the normalization chosen in ( [ eq : templatedecayingdm ] ) . for the search regions 3 and 4 of  @xcite and the various density profiles , the prefactor in ( [ eq : lineeg ] ) is of the order @xmath32 .",
    "the second contribution to the continuum gamma spectrum arises from the weighted sum of the spectra produced by annihilation or decays , excluding @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of photons per energy and per annihilation / decay resulting from each mode , and @xmath36 is the corresponding branching ratio . for the line",
    ", we use the same shape as in  @xcite based on the instrument response function of the fermi - lat detector ( fwhm@xmath37 ) , which has somewhat broader tails compared to a gaussian , and also smooth the step function appearing in the extragalactic contribution ( [ eq : lineeg ] ) accordingly .",
    "the continuum flux is determined using pythia 8.1  @xcite . in order",
    "to increase the sensitivity to the continuum flux we use the data presented in  @xcite over the full energy range @xmath38 gev , taking the more finely binned data where they are available ( @xmath39 gev ) .",
    "we show our results for both the source and ultraclean event classes as defined in the pass 7 version 6 data release , corresponding to 43 months of data  @xcite .",
    "the former class yields better statistics due to an increased effective area , and the latter a lower contamination with charged cosmic rays . for both",
    ", the zenith - angle cut is @xmath40 .",
    "as discussed above , the constraints arising from the relative strength of monochromatic and continuum gamma rays are rather insensitive to the dark matter profile .",
    "for definiteness , we assume an einasto profile  @xcite normalized to a local density @xmath41 unless stated otherwise ( see section  [ sec : profile ] for details ) .",
    "lastly , we require that @xmath42 as a conservative lower limit for the background power law index @xcite , while its normalization is freely varied . for performing the fit we use the profile likelihood method as detailed in  @xcite , with @xmath43c.l .",
    "statistical errors obtained by varying @xmath16 ( with fixed @xmath44 ) and profiling over @xmath17 and @xmath18 until the @xmath45-value has decreased by 3.84 .",
    "we checked that our statistical analysis reproduces the best - fit values and confidence intervals in  @xcite using the smaller energy window and a single line up to @xmath46 for regions 2 - 4 , both data samples and all density profiles .",
    "when including @xmath44 in the fit , we use @xmath47 to obtain the @xmath43c.l .",
    "regions , corresponding to the @xmath48 distribution that is expected for two parameters of interest when keeping @xmath44 fixed , while it is somewhat steeper than @xmath48 when including @xmath44 in the fit , lying between a @xmath49 and @xmath48 distribution .",
    "therefore the confidence regions assuming @xmath48 may be regarded as conservative . ] .",
    "we will comment on the dependence on the various assumptions later on .      for decaying gravitino dark matter , which we consider as representative example , we take the decay channels @xmath50 apart from @xmath7 into account .",

    "although the best - fit values for the considered search regions are compatible with each other , they are in tension with the lower limits on the lifetime obtained by the recent analysis of the fermi collaboration @xcite , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbarp ] .",
    "note that the fermi analysis is based on a rather wide search region , and therefore sensitive to the dark matter flux originating in the halo of the milky way .",
    "due to the linear scaling of the flux with the dark matter density in the case of decaying dark matter , one typically expects a larger flux from the halo compared to the center than for annihilating dark matter .",
    "thus , for the case of decaying dark matter the gamma - ray line should have been observed also within the search region used by the fermi collaboration , provided that the radial distribution of dark matter can be well described by the considered nfw or einasto profiles .",
    "the discrepancy is less pronounced for the contracted profiles which are more cuspy towards the galactic center . on the other hand , for annihilating dark matter ,",
    "the cross section required to explain the fermi gamma - ray feature is compatible with earlier upper limits assuming nfw or einasto profiles  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this tension disfavors the explanation of the excess in terms of decaying dark matter .",
    "however , because of the large uncertainty of the actual dark matter distribution close to the galactic center as compared to the halo @xcite , and since one can not exclude large systematic uncertainties at present @xcite , we believe that it would be premature to rule out decaying dark matter as an explanation of the fermi excess based on this tension .",
    "in light of tentative evidence for a gamma - ray line observed by fermi - lat near the galactic center , we have investigated the consequences for several prototype scenarios of decaying and annihilating dark matter , motivated by supersymmetric models with gravitino , higgsino or wino - like lsp .",
    "we find that , independently of the actual dark matter distribution , the consistency of continuum and monochromatic contributions to the photon spectrum from dark matter decay or annihilation requires a branching ratio into monochromatic photons larger than @xmath109 .",
    "both higgsino and wino dark matter can be ruled out because of a too large continuum flux , independently of the production mechanism , while gravitino dark matter with wino nlsp is compatible .",
    "we have also investigated constraints arising from the primary antiproton flux , which depend on the adopted propagation model .",
    "the resulting limits are comparable to the ones from continuum gamma - rays for annihilating dark matter , but can be more important for decaying dark matter .",
    "the morphology of the tentative excess , if confirmed , could yield valuable information on the distribution of dark matter close to the galactic center . when assuming conventional nfw or einasto profile functions , the required partial lifetimes for decaying dark matter @xmath110s are in tension with lower limits obtained from the galactic halo .",
    "this tension is less pronounced for more cuspy contracted profiles .",
    "if decaying gravitino dark matter is indeed responsible for the excess , the dark matter density should be enhanced in the galactic center region compared to conventional models .",
