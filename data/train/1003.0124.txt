    "fractal conception @xcite has become a widespread idea in contemporary science ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "characteristic feature of fractal sets is known to be the self - similarity : if one takes a part of the whole set , it looks like the original set after appropriate scaling .",
    "formal basis of the self - similarity is the power - law function @xmath3 with the hurst exponent @xmath4 ( for time series , value @xmath5 is reduced to the fluctuation amplitude and @xmath6 is the interval size within which this amplitude is determined ) .",
    "while the simple case of monofractal is characterized by a single exponent @xmath4 , a multifractal system is described by a continuous spectrum of exponents , singularity spectrum @xmath7 with argument @xmath8 being the exponent deforming measures of elementary boxes that cover the fractal set @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameter @xmath8 represents a self - similarity degree of a homogeneous function being intrinsic in self - similar systems @xcite ( in this way , within nonextensive thermostatistics , this exponent expresses the escort probability @xmath9 in terms of the original one @xmath10 @xcite ) . in physical applications , a key role",
    "is played by the partition function @xmath11 with @xmath6 as a characteristic size of boxes covering multifractal and the exponent @xmath12 connected with the generalized hurst exponent @xmath7 by the relation @xmath13 .",
    "as fractals are scale invariant sets , it is natural to apply the quantum calculus to describe multifractals . indeed , quantum analysis is based on the jackson derivative @xmath14 that yields variation of a function @xmath15 with respect to the scaling deformation @xmath16 of its argument @xcite .",
    "first , this idea has been realized in the work @xcite where support space of multifractal has been proposed to deform by means of action of the jackson derivative ( [ 1 ] ) on the variable @xmath17 reduced to the size @xmath6 of covering boxes . in this letter , we use quite different approach wherein deformation is applied to the multifractal parameter @xmath8 itself to vary it by means of finite dilatation @xmath18 instead of infinitesimal shift @xmath19 .",
    "we demonstrate below that related description allows one to generalize definitions of the partition function , the mass exponent , and the averages of random variables on the basis of deformed expansion in power series over difference @xmath20 .",
    "we apply the formalism proposed to consideration of multifractals in mathematical physics ( the cantor binomial set ) , econophysics ( exchange currency series ) , and solid state physics ( porous surface condensates ) .",
    "following the standard scheme @xcite , we consider a multifractal set covered by elementary boxes @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "its properties are known to be determined by the partition function @xmath23 that takes the value @xmath24 at @xmath25 , in accordance with the normalization condition . since @xmath26 for all boxes @xmath27 , the function ( [ z ] ) decreases monotonically from maximum magnitude @xmath28 related to @xmath29 to extreme values @xmath30 which are determined in the @xmath31 limit by maximum probability @xmath32 on the positive half - axis @xmath33 and minimum magnitude @xmath34 on the negative one . in the simplest case of the uniform distribution @xmath35 fixed by the statistical weight @xmath36",

    "as the second example we consider the time series of the currency exchange of euro to us dollar in the course of the 2007  2009 years which include financial crisis ( data are taken from website www.fxeuroclub.ru ) .",

    "moreover , we restrict ourselves by consideration of the coefficients ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) of the lowest orders @xmath49 which make it possible to visualize a difference between fractal characteristics of the time series intervals pointed out . along this way , we base on the method of the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite to find the mass exponent @xmath12 , whose use arrives at the dependencies depicted in figure [ currency ] .    ) at @xmath108 for the time series of the currency exchange of euro to us dollar ; related entropy coefficients ( [ entropy ] ) at @xmath108 ( b ) and @xmath180 ( c ) ( bold dots correspond to the time interval before financial crisis , circles  after crisis).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",

    "thus , this example demonstrates visually that generalized multifractal characteristics elaborated on the basis of the developed formalism allow one to study subtle details of self - similarly evolved processes .",
    "the last example is concerned with macrostructure of condensates which have been obtained as result of sputtering of substances in accumulative ion - plasma devices @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of such a process is that its use has allowed to obtain the porous condensates type of those that are shown in figures [ surface]a and [ surface]b for carbon and titanium , respectively .",

    "comparing these dependencies , we can convince that difference between the carbon condensate , which has strongly rugged surface , with the titanium one , becomes apparent already at use of the fractal dimension and entropy coefficients ( [ lambda ] ) , ( [ entropy ] ) related to the lowest order @xmath108 .",
    "thus , in the case of multifractal objects with strongly different structures the use of usual multifractal characteristics is appeared to be sufficient .",
    "generalizing the multifractal theory @xcite , we have represented the partition function ( [ z1 ] ) , the mass exponent ( [ tau ] ) , and the average @xmath155 of self - similarly distributed random variable as deformed series in power of difference @xmath20 .",

    "the study of the cantor set has shown that both fractal dimension coefficients ( [ lambda ] ) and entropies ( [ entropy ] ) coincide with usual multifractal characteristics in the lowest order @xmath108 , but display very complicated behaviour at @xmath110 .",
    "on the contrary , consideration of both carbon and titanium surface condensates has shown that their macrostructures can be characterized by use of usual fractal dimension and entropy coefficients related to the order @xmath108 .",
    "much more complicated situation takes place in the case of the time series type of currency exchange series . here",
    ", a difference between various series is displayed for the fractal dimension coefficients already in the lowest order @xmath108 , but the entropy coefficients coincide at @xmath108 , but become different at @xmath180 .",
