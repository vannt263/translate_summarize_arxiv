    "electron quantum optics can be regarded as the fermionic counterpart of standard quantum optics based on photons  @xcite .",
    "the latter is built on three crucial ingredients : phase - coherent photon waveguides , beam splitters , and single - photons sources .",
    "therefore , to perform quantum - optics experiments with electrons , a huge effort has been invested to transfer these ingredients to solid - state devices . in this respect ,",
    "the edge states of quantum hall systems provide suitable phase - coherent wave - guides for electrons , because transport is ballistic due to their intrinsic chirality  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the electron counterpart of photon beam splitters is then naturally found in quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) , which make it possible to mix and recombine the incoming electron fluxes  @xcite , just as the photon beam splitters separate the photon beam into transmitted and reflected components .",
    "finally , the single - electron source has been recently experimentally realized .",
    "this has been achieved by means of driven mesoscopic capacitors ( mcs )  @xcite or lorentzian voltage pulses  @xcite , thus accomplishing the receipt needed to implement electron quantum optics .",
    "these achievements have paved the way for realizing fascinating experiments : quantum tomography protocols to measure single - electron decoherence,@xcite the investigation of indistinguishability and fermionic statistics via antibunching effects in two - particle interferometric setups  @xcite and the detection of charge fractionalization in the presence of interactions@xcite represent notable examples .",
    "recently , two - dimensional topological insulators ( 2d tis )  @xcite have also been considered as an interesting playground for implementing electron quantum optics experiments  @xcite . here",
    ", two electron waveguides emerge on the edge , one for spin - up and one for spin - down electrons .",
    "however , contrary to standard one - dimensional systems , the bulk topological properties force the two species to propagate in opposite directions and time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) prevents backscattering between the two channels  @xcite .",
    "therefore , 2d tis support phase - coherent ballistic transport on the edges  @xcite .",
    "the role of beam splitters can be played by qpcs , and it is noteworthy that the range of possible applications is even richer than for qh systems because the incoming electrons have a larger number of possible scattering channels due to the additional spin degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mesoscopic capacitors implemented in 2d tis inject pairs of electrons instead of single electrons because of kramers degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "this richness leads to a novel antibunching phenomenon termed @xmath4 dip  @xcite in contrast to the pauli dip observed in qh channels  @xcite , and can be exploited to create ac current sources which can be tuned to induce either pure charge or pure spin currents@xcite .",
    "moreover , the injection of two - particle ( electrons or holes ) states is very attractive for the creation and manipulation of entanglement in solid - state devices  @xcite , which is at the basis of quantum information processing  @xcite , so that creation of entanglement in 2d tis has been recently proposed  @xcite .    , @xmath5 with tunnel junction 1 at @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "spin up and spin down edge states are depicted in red and blue respectively .",
    "the antidot is driven by a time - dependent potential @xmath8.,width=302 ]    in this work we consider the device schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : antidotqshdouble ] , which consists of a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) antidot  @xcite acting as a mc  @xcite .",
    "the antidot can be realized either by mechanically etching the sample or , in the case of inas / gasb quantum wells , by gating the central region and thus causing a transition from qsh to trivial insulator  @xcite . in both cases",
    ", a pair of helical edge states appears around the antidot , in addition to the ones appearing at the external edges of the bar .",
    "the antidot is tunnel - coupled to both the two edges of the qsh bar .",
    "contrary to the edge states , whose energy spectrum can be assumed to be continuous , the finite size of the antidot makes its spectrum discrete with an energy spacing @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the fermi velocity and @xmath11 the radius of the antidot . by applying a time - periodic gate voltage @xmath8",
    ", its energy levels can be shifted periodically above and below the fermi level of the edges , thus allowing the antidot to operate as a mc , able to periodically inject kramers pairs of electrons or holes .",
    "contrary to previous proposals  @xcite , which always considered coupling with a single edge , we characterize the ability of the driven antidot to inject particles into both edges : one electron is injected into one edge , and its time - reversal partner is injected either into the same edge , with opposite spin because of pauli principle , or in the other one , with arbitrary spin orientation .",
    "therefore , we expect the injection process to be much richer than the one occurring when the mc is coupled to a single edge , in which case the only possibility in the presence of trs is to inject the two electrons forming the kramers pair into the same edge with opposite spin .",
    "this richer scenario is particularly interesting when turning the attention to entanglement production .",
    "indeed , the injected state is in general a superposition of many different orthogonal states , and we show that entanglement production is possible only when the mc is coupled to both edges .",
    "this modification also leads to peculiar transport properties from which we can extract information about the entanglement created .",
    "in particular , by considering the two - terminal setup of fig .  [",
    "fig : antidotqshdouble ] , we find that if the kramers pair is injected into a single edge then exactly one particle is collected in each detector , while the possibility to split the kramers pair in the two edges give rise to alternative scenarios in which both particles are collected at the same contact .",
    "therefore , we are able to relate the concurrence , which measures the entanglement production , to the zero - frequency noise produced in a simple two - terminal configuration , thus providing a direct connection between quantum effects and standard transport measurements . furthermore , we show that the efficiency of the device , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ratio between the number of emitted entangled states and the total one , is very high compared to previous proposals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] , we solve the dynamical scattering problem for the driven helical antidot coupled to the edges of the 2d ti . in particular , we compute the current injected in each channel and demonstrate that exactly one electron and one hole kramers pair are injected in each cycle of the drive .",
    "we also compute the zero - frequency noise and discuss the conditions under which the different channels are correlated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement ] , we introduce the concurrence @xmath0 and the efficiency @xmath1 , which measure the ability of the device to generate entangled states .",
    "we show that even though there is no entanglement at perfect efficiency ( @xmath12 for @xmath13 ) , the efficiency in the case of maximally entangled emitted states is very high compared to previous proposals , namely we find @xmath14 for @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we establish a direct connection between these quantities and the zero - frequency noise measured in the two terminal configuration , which one can easily measure in experiments .",
    "we also suggest an alternative protocol to detect the entanglement via violation of a clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality  @xcite . section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "to characterize the mc we need to solve the dynamical scattering problem  @xcite associated with the tunneling processes between the edge states and the driven antidot .",
    "we define the scattering states on the edges and around the antidot as @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are scattering amplitudes , @xmath19 are the incoming amplitudes and @xmath20 $ ] accounts for the phase acquired by the electron when moving in the time - dependent potential .",
    "note that , within our choice of coordinates @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : antidotqshdouble ] ) , left - moving spin up and right - moving spin down electrons propagate on the edges , while right - moving spin up and left - moving spin down propagate around the antidot . the wave - functions in eq .",
    "are connected to each other through the scattering matrices of the qpcs as @xmath22 for the lower tunnel region , while at the upper one @xmath23 the form of the scattering matrices @xmath24 is  @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the spin - preserving and spin - flipping tunneling amplitudes respectively and @xmath28 the amplitude probability for electrons to remain on the same channel without tunneling at @xmath29-th qpc .",
    "note that backscattering is forbidden due to trs , which also implies  @xcite @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the total tunneling probability through the @xmath29-th qpc , with @xmath32 . by inserting the expressions evaluated from eq .   into eq .   and",
    "allows one to find the scattering amplitudes as a function of the incoming amplitudes @xmath19 .",
    "although it is possible to solve the problem for a more general driving potential  @xcite , for simplicity and sake of clarity we only present the solution in the adiabatic regime in which the driving is very slow , which corresponds to calculating the frozen scattering matrix  @xcite with @xmath33 . by modelling @xmath34 ,",
    "the adiabatic regime occurs for @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the period of the potential ( @xmath37 being a phase shift ) and @xmath38 the dwell time spent by the kramers pair on the antidot .",
    "the constant part of the potential @xmath39 accounts for a detuning of the nearest level in the antidot from the fermi level , and we assume that the amplitude of the oscillating potential @xmath40 , such that only one antidot level crosses the fermi level at the resonance times @xmath41 . this is a necessary condition to inject a single electron and a single hole kramers pair per cycle , otherwise multiple pairs can be injected .    in the adiabatic regime",
    "the outgoing amplitudes are related to the incoming ones as @xmath42 , where the frozen scattering matrix @xmath43 , written in the basis @xmath44 , reads    @xmath45    a few comments are in order concerning eq .  .",
    "the zeros correspond to the absence of backscattering , which is guaranteed as long as trs is preserved .",
    "moreover it is easy to check that @xmath46 under the exchange @xmath47 in the tunneling parameters . in the limit @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( or vice versa ) the antidot",
    "is coupled to a single edge  @xcite and all the off - diagonal matrix elements vanish .",
    "finally , if only one type of tunneling processes is possible ( either @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) , the matrix elements connecting incoming and outgoing states with different spin vanish as expected .",
    "the frozen scattering matrix still implicitly depends on time through the phase factors containing @xmath52 , after making the replacement  @xcite @xmath53 .    for small transmission probability @xmath54 the antidot energy levels",
    "are well resolved and the scattering matrix @xmath43 deviates from unity only around resonance  @xcite .",
    "we can therefore expand the matrix elements of @xmath43 around the resonance times @xmath55 to lowest order in the tunneling amplitudes as    @xmath56    with @xmath57 , and @xmath58 corresponding to the inverse tunneling rate through the @xmath29-th barrier , with @xmath59 .      in order to characterize the device we compute the emitted current .",
    "the current injected into the spin @xmath60 channel through the @xmath29-th tunnel region is obtained from eq .   as  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fermi distribution function . at low temperature",

    "finds that a charge @xmath65 is injected through the @xmath29-th barrier during a time interval @xmath66 around @xmath67 , while the same charge is adsorbed around @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the total charge injected by the mc around @xmath67 , when the antidot level is driven above the fermi energy , is @xmath69 , corresponding to the emission of exactly one kramers pair . on the other hand , when the antidot level is pushed below the fermi energy around @xmath68 an opposite charge @xmath70 is injected , the antidot adsorbing a pair of electrons from the edges .      to characterize the device we now study on the current - current correlations between the different channels",
    ". in particular we are interested in the zero - frequency symmetrized noise spectral power  @xcite ( @xmath71 ) @xmath72 by neglecting the thermal contribution , which is valid if @xmath73 , only the shot noise contributes , and in the adiabatic regime eq .",

    "electron and hole emissions contribute independently , @xmath76 , and are equal , @xmath77 . after lengthy but straightforward algebra",
    "we obtain  @xcite    @xmath78    firstly , we notice that a sum rule holds for the zero - frequency noise , @xmath79 .",

    "the other correlation functions are in general different from zero .",
    "however in the presence of a single type of scattering ( either @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) , channels with opposite spin are uncorrelated , so that @xmath82 .",
    "finally we note that all the matrix elements vanish if the antidot is coupled to one edge only ( @xmath83 ) . in this case",
    "the kramers pair can be emitted only in one edge with opposite spin , due to trs .",
    "therefore , there is no uncertainty in the emitted state and the electron source is noiseless .",

    "contrary to these proposals , the multiple tunneling processes from the mc to the different edges which exist in the setup of fig .",
    "[ fig : antidotqshdouble ] lead to a richer scenario for the investigation of entanglement properties .",

    "the collection of two electrons in the right ( left ) contact identifies the fifth ( sixth ) state , so that no entanglement is present in this case",

    "simple algebra gives the expression for the concurrence for the postselected state @xmath103 in eq .   as @xmath104 it is worth pointing out that the concurrence does not depend on the geometrical parameters @xmath91 . in this sense ,",
    "the entanglement is insensitive to the detailed geometry of the device in fig .",
    "[ fig : antidotqshdouble ] , and is not affected , for instance , by the antidot being closer to one of the two contacts .",
    "this is due to the weak influence of dephasing mechanisms on the properties of the helical edge states . indeed , in the presence of dephasing",
