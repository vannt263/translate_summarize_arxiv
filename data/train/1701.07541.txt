    "in recent years , high - contrast imaging surveys have discovered many wide - orbit substellar companions , which are located at tens to hundreds of au from their host stars and have masses of a few to tens of @xmath8 .",
    "some of these companions have features indicative of accretion disks , including optical and near - infrared emissions such as h@xmath0 , br-@xmath9 , and pa-@xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , high dust extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , and infrared excess from dust emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected that disks could be common among young substellar companions because the main formation mechanisms  collapse of prestellar cores , fragmentation of circumstellar disks , and core accretion plus subsequent scattering ",
    "can all produce disk - bearing companions .",
    "each mechanism , however , can leave distinct imprints on disk properties .",
    "for instance , objects formed by disk fragmentation may have higher disk masses and accretion rates compared to those formed by prestellar core collapse @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", scattering can be destructive to disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and unlike stars , low - mass objects are not efficient to accrete new disks from the natal molecular clouds after scattering @xcite . characterizing disks of substellar companions therefore provides a new avenue for studying wide companions mass assembly history .",
    "in addition , if gas emission lines such as co can be spatially and spectrally resolved , the dynamical mass of the central object can be determined assuming a keplerian velocity field .",
    "since masses are usually derived by comparing observables to theoretical predictions , this dynamical approach has great potential to calibrate evolutionary models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , disk masses , sizes , structure , and lifetimes ultimately regulate satellite formation and satellite - disk interaction .",
    "as wide companions are well separated from their host stars , they offer a clear view to the relevant physical processes .",
    "still , imaging disks around very low - mass companions remains challenging ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "simulations have shown that they tend to be compact because they are tidally truncated at @xmath51/3 of the hill radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for objects in nearby star - forming regions ( @xmath5100 to 150 pc ) , their disks are probably not larger than @xmath55 to 30 au in radii , which in turn requires a @xmath1101 resolution to resolve them in ( sub)millimeter . with the advent of alma , it is now possible to directly image and characterize these disks .",
    "@xcite showed that gsc 6214 - 210 b has a dust mass of @xmath110.15  @xmath7 in its disk .",
    "@xcite also found that only @xmath110.04 @xmath7 of dust is present in the disk around gq lup b. most notably , @xcite and @xcite detected fw tau c s accretion disk in 1.3 mm dust continuum and @xmath12co ( 21 ) emission , respectively .",
    "@xcite inferred a dust mass of 12 @xmath7 , sufficient to form satellites analogous to the galilean moons .    here",
    "we present the alma 1.3 mm map of the gq lup system , a pre - main - sequence star with a 1040  @xmath13  companion at @xmath5110 au projected separation .",
    "both components have been shown to exhibit accretion signatures ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . with a @xmath5@xmath6 resolution",
    ", we resolve the primary star s accretion disk .",
    "the companion s disk is , however , not detected .",
    "we also present the 0.61  imaging of the system using the magellan adaptive optics ( magao ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and derive mass accretion rates from h@xmath0 intensities .",
    "gq lup a is a classical t tauri star ( ctts ) with a spectral type of k7ev ( @xcite , @xcite ) in the lupus i cloud ( @xmath5150 pc ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations suggested that it is 25 myr old , with a photospheric temperature of 4300 k and a mass of 1.05 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "photometric monitoring indicated that it has an inclination of 27@xmath15 and a rotation period of 8.45 days @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most studied cttss due to many features indicative of active accretion onto the star from a circumstellar disk , such as brightness variations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , inverse p - cygni profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , optical veiling ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , very intense magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and strong excess from near to far - infrared ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion disk was first imaged at 1.3 mm dust continuum emission by @xcite using the submillimeter array .",
    "the disk is compact , low - mass , and possibly tidally truncated .",
    "@xcite presented far - infrared spectra taken with @xmath16 pacs and proposed that the 63  excess may come from crystalline water ice in the outer disk .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the alma 870  and co ( 32 ) imaging of the disk and derived a gas - to - dust ratio well below typical ratios in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the substellar companion gq lup b was discovered by @xcite , and its common proper motion was soon confirmed @xcite .",
    "mass estimates are very model - dependent , but most studies overlap in the range of @xmath510 to 40 @xmath8 ( see table 1 of @xcite for published results ) . like the primary star",
    ", gq lup b is believed to harbor an accretion disk .",
    "lines of evidence include red @xmath17 compared to young free - floating objects @xcite , the 1.28  pa-@xmath10 emission line ( @xcite ; but also see @xcite and @xcite ) , and overluminosity in the @xmath18 f606w flux @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission , along with optical continuum excess , were detected by @xcite .",
    "a relatively high accretion rate @xmath19 was derived by modeling the continuum excess as a hot hydrogen slab @xcite .",
    "the dust mass in the disk was shown to be @xmath110.04 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the spin and the barycentric radial velocity ( rv ) of gq lup b using high - dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "they showed that compared to the giant planet @xmath10 pic b , gq lup b spins slowly because it is still contracting and gaining angular momentum from its disk .",
    "their new rv estimate , together with the astrometric monitoring in @xcite , has provided constraints on its orbit .",

    "gq lup was observed with alma in cycle 3 on ut 2015 , november 1 with the band 6 receiver and 41 12-m antennas reaching a maximum baseline of 14969.3 meters .",
    "three of the 4 available basebands were configured for continuum observations to search for dust emission , each with 128 15.625 mhz channels for a total of 2 ghz continuum bandwidth , and centered at 233.0 , 246.0 , and 248.0 ghz .",
    "the final baseband was centered at 230.538 ghz with 3840 0.122 mhz ( hanning smoothed to a resolution of 0.244 mhz , or 0.32 km s@xmath37 ) channels to search for @xmath12co ( 21 ) emission from our targets .",
    "scans on gq lup were interleaved with the phase calibrator qso j1534 - 3526 .",
    "the total on - source time was 11.19 minutes .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way with the ` casa ` software package , using the water vapor radiometry data and qso j1534 - 3526 for gain calibration , qso j1427 - 4206 for bandpass calibration , and qso j1337 - 1257 for flux calibration . the calibrated data were fourier inverted and deconvolved from the beam using the msmfs - clean algorithm @xcite with no frequency dependence , clean components which are point sources and 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 times the size of the beam , and natural weighting for the best sensitivity .",
    "we produced a continuum map from all four basebands , excluding channels in the @xmath48 to 15 km s@xmath37 range of the co baseband to avoid contaminating our map with co emission .",
    "the final 1.3 mm continuum map was produced after four iterations of phase - only self - calibration using a model produced from the clean algorithm .",
    "we show the 1.3 mm continuum map in figure [ fig : alma_cont ] .",
    "the continuum map has an rms of 39 @xmath49jy beam@xmath37 , with a synthesized beam of @xmath50 and position angle of @xmath51 .",
    "beam ( 8.1 au @xmath52 4.7 au at a distance of 150 pc ) is shown as a yellow oval .",
    "north is up and east is left . ]      in the continuum map there is a clear detection of a source located at 15@xmath5349@xmath541209 , @xmath3835390543 .",
    "accounting for gq lup a s proper motion ( @xmath55 mas yr@xmath37 , @xmath56 mas yr@xmath37 ; @xcite ) , this is coincident with its reported position at 15@xmath5349@xmath541210 , @xmath3835390512 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we measured a flux of @xmath57 mjy for this source .",
    "as we know the position of gq lup b , we can search a smaller region of the image with a lower detection threshold for emission .",
    "noise in our alma map is highly gaussian , so we would expect 68% of the peaks to be within 1@xmath58 of zero , 95% to be within 2@xmath58 , and so on . in a 01 diameter region around the known position of gq lup b",
    "there are 4 beams , so we would expect @xmath50.2 noise peaks above 2@xmath58 , but @xmath591 noise peak above 3@xmath58 , so any peak above 3@xmath58 is likely real .",
    "however , we did not detect any emission from gq lup b.      to place an upper limit on the disk mass of gq lup b , we inserted fake sources into our image in a 01 diameter area around the known position of gq lup b , and used our source finding routine to search for them .",
    "we varied both the disk size and the flux of the input sources , and for each disk size / flux combination we calculated the percentage of the fake sources that were recovered in the map .",
    "for each disk size , we set the upper limit on disk flux to be the minimum flux for which 99.7% ( @xmath60 ) of the input fake sources were detected .",
    "flux upper limits can be converted into dust mass upper limits by assuming the dust is optically thin and using the standard prescription @xcite , @xmath61 we used the standard assumption of a characteristic dust temperature of @xmath62k and a 1.3 mm dust opacity of @xmath63 2.3 @xmath64 g@xmath37 .",
    "we used a distance of 150 pc to gq lup .",
    "upper limit on the dust mass of the gq lup b disk as a function of disk radius .",
    "the disk has a flux of @xmath110.3 mjy corresponding to @xmath110.25 @xmath7 of dust if it is a point source , or a flux of @xmath111.1 mjy corresponding to @xmath111 @xmath7 of dust if it reaches 1/3 hill radius ( @xmath57.5 au ) .",
    "we note that the recent 870  imaging by @xcite placed a much stronger constraint on the dust mass , @xmath110.04 @xmath7 . ]    in figure [ fig : upper_limits ] we show a plot of the upper limit on gq lup b s disk mass as a function of disk radius .",
    "the calculation ran from a point source disk to a disk with a radius of 50 mas .",
    "this radius corresponds to a third of the hill radius for gq lup b , which is expected to be the upper limit on the size of the disk .",
    "this calculation also assumed that the projected separation of 0721 is equal to the semi - major axis of the companion s orbit .",
    "the hill radius , and therefore the expected disk radius upper limit , would be larger if the system has a larger separation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : alma_cont ] , the disk around the primary star is strongly detected at 1.3 mm continuum .",
    "we fit the visibility data for gq lup a with a series of two disk models to constrain the parameters of the disk .",
    "we modeled the disk with a detailed radiative transfer modeling scheme , using the radmc-3d code @xcite to produce disk models .",
    "our model included a central protostar with a temperature of 4300 k and luminosity of 1 @xmath65 , consistent with the measured values ( see table [ tab : prop_gqlup ] ) .",
    "it also included a dusty protoplanetary disk , for which we used two different density prescriptions .",
    "model a used the density profile of a flared power - law disk , @xmath66 @xmath67 ^ 2\\right ) , \\text {   with}\\ ] ] @xmath68 we allowed the disk mass ( @xmath69 ) , inner and outer disk radii ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , the surface density index ( @xmath9 ) , scale height index ( @xmath10 ) , and scale height at 1 au ( @xmath72 ) , to vary as free parameters .",
    "model b used the surface density profile of a flared accretion disk with a radial power - law distribution of viscosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath73.\\ ] ] the parameters for model b were the same as those of model a , with the exception of the critical radius @xmath74 , beyond which the surface density drops exponentially .",
    "this replaced the disk radius , beyond which the density drops to zero in model a. we also supplied dust opacities to the models .",
    "we assumed that dust grains are 70% astronomical silicate and 30% graphite @xcite following a power - law distribution of dust grain sizes , with a minimum size of 5 nm , a maximum size of 3 mm , and a power law exponent of @xmath383.5 .",
    "this produced a 1.3 mm opacity of 2.25 @xmath75 g@xmath37 , in good agreement with the typical value assumed for disk mass calculations .",
    "we used radmc-3d to calculate the temperature throughout the density distribution . following this we produced synthetic images with raytracing of the protostar model , and",
    "fourier transformed the images to produce model 1.3 mm visibility profiles .",
    "we fit these models directly to the visibility data using the markov chain monte carlo code ` emcee ` @xcite .",
    "` emcee ` uses an affine - invariant mcmc ensemble sampler , which employs a series of walkers that step through parameter space and converge on the best fit .",
    "we positioned 200 walkers throughout a large region of parameter space and allowed them to move towards regions of lower @xmath76 .",
    "we show the best fit parameters for each model in table [ tab : disk_parameters ] , and images , residuals , and visibilities for the best - fit models in figure [ fig : models ] .",
    "gq lup was observed on ut 2015 , april 16 in the simultaneous differential imaging ( sdi ) mode @xcite of the visao camera ( @xmath77 field of view , 79 mas plate scale ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rotator was off to facilitate angular differential imaging ( adi ) @xcite .",
    "weather was photometric with low ground level winds .",
    "seeing varied from 07 to 08 .",
    "ao parameters and exposure time are listed in table [ tab : magao_obs ] .",
    "images in the h@xmath0 ( 656 nm ; @xmath78 = 6.3 nm ) and continuum ( 643 nm ; @xmath78 = 6.1 nm ) channels were separated , dark subtracted , registered and centered , and then the median radial profile of each image was subtracted from itself .",
    "after these basic reduction steps , we then proceeded to employ the klip algorithm @xcite for psf subtraction with adi .",
    "our implementation of the adi+klip algorithm allows for the selection of many parameters , including the size of the search region , a minimum rotation requirement , and the number of modes @xcite . the following sequence of steps was taken to find a set of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) optimizing reduction parameters in an unbiased way .",
    "first , an initial reduction was carried out to locate the companion .",
    "this employed a search annulus from 50 to 150 pixels ( 04 to 12 ) , minimum of 2.5 pixels of rotation at the inner edge between the image being reduced and basis images , and modes ranging from 5 to 30 .",
    "after psf subtraction , images were de - rotated and the final image was formed as the 5@xmath58-clipped mean .",
    "the final image was then unsharp - masked with a 20-pixel gaussian kernel , and then smoothed with a 5-pixel gaussian .",
    "unsharp masking acts a high - pass filter , removing the stellar halo and the residual low - spatial frequency noise remaining after psf subtraction .",
    "given the low quality correction which yielded an fwhm much larger than @xmath79 , the psf was oversampled by the diffraction limited plate scale of the visao camera .",
    "gaussian smoothing ( low - pass filter ) hence smooths pixel - to - pixel noise .",
    "the companion was readily seen in the h@xmath0 channel with s / n @xmath5 5 using 8 modes , but no detection was evident in the continuum channel ( upper panels of figure [ fig : magao_alma ] ) .",
    "next , we injected negative planets @xcite with the same search region , using 8 modes to form an initial estimate of the planet flux , finding @xmath80h@xmath0 @xmath5 8.7 mag as the planet brightness which minimized the standard deviation in an aperture with radius of 1 fwhm at the location of the companion .",
    "it is difficult to estimate uncertainties using the negative planet technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and optimizing the reduction parameters on the companion itself risks biasing results due to speckles .",
    "to address these issues , we conducted a grid search over the parameters , testing on an ensemble of positive fake planets injected at the same separation but at a range of position angles . to conduct this search in a reasonable amount of time we employed the `` findr '' distributed computing ( cloud - based ) data reduction system @xcite . in all trials , a negative planet with the above estimated brightness",
    "was injected at the location of the detection to avoid cross - talk .",
    "planet injection was performed on the dark - subtracted / registered / centered images , and then the radial profile was subtracted .",
    "the parameters tested are given in table [ tab : halpha_redux ] , and the klip algorithm was applied for each possible combination .",
    "the final combined image at each combination was filtered as above .",
    "the optimum parameters were determined as those which maximized the mean s /",
    "n on the ensemble of positive fake planets injected at 8.7 mag brightness .",
    "the flux of the companion was then determined by comparing its photometry when reduced with those optimum parameters to the positive fake planet results .",
    "uncertainties were estimated from the standard deviation of the results from the fake planets .    at the optimum parameters , gq",
    "lup b was detected in h@xmath0 at s / n @xmath5 6.3 with a contrast of 8.60 @xmath81 0.16 mag .",
    "for comparison , the h@xmath0 contrast in @xcite is @xmath57.1 mag ( zhou , y. 2016 , private communication ) .",
    "the contrast at 643 nm is @xmath828.81 mag ( 3@xmath58 upper limit ) .",
    "we also found that gq lup a s h@xmath0 flux is @xmath50.60 mag brighter than its 643 nm continuum due to active accretion .",
    "we derived the mass accretion rates for gq lup a and b following @xcite and @xcite . in brief , we computed the h@xmath0 line luminosity @xmath83 , used it to derive the accretion luminosity @xmath84 , and applied the energy equation @xmath85 to determine @xmath36 .",
    "since we did not observe a standard star at @xmath86 band , we estimated gq lup a s average @xmath86 brightness to be 11.0 mag by averaging literature fluxes in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , with no attempt to homogenize photometric systems .",
    "the uncertainty was taken to be 0.7 mag as @xcite found that gq lup a s @xmath86 flux can change by 1.4 mag over its 8.45-day rotation period . to recover the true @xmath83",
    ", we also have to correct for dust extinction , which is @xmath87 mag to the star @xcite but unknown to the companion . as a result ,",
    "our @xmath36 estimate for gq lup b should be considered a lower limit .",

    "our @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 detections of gq lup b are also shown in figure [ fig : magao_alma ] .",
    "we estimated gq lup b s fluxes by injecting fake planets .",
    "for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the primary star in the unsaturated data was used to create fake planets . for @xmath1 , since we did not acquire any unsaturated data , we estimated the peak height of the primary star in the saturated data from its beam splitter optical ghost @xcite .",
    "then , we flagged the saturated core , assigned the peak value to the center , and fit a two - component gaussian to create a psf template . to compensate for flux loss from data reduction , including filtering , we injected fake planets at the same separation from the star but with different position angles , and repeated the data reduction procedures .",
    "we found that throughputs were @xmath8298% for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but only @xmath532% for @xmath1 as it involved more aggressive spatial filtering and so higher losses of low spatial frequency flux . compensating for these flux losses , we derived contrasts of @xmath106 mag , @xmath107 mag , and @xmath108 mag for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .    to perform absolute photometry , we compared gq lup a to the standard star gj 440 .",

    "this is consistent with no inner clearing , because the resolution of our observations does not allow us to well constrain the inner radius below @xmath54.5 au .",
    "since there is unlikely any gaps or companions hidden within the disk , gq lup b was probably not scattered to its current orbit , but instead formed in - situ like binary stars , as we discuss more in section [ discussion ] .",

    ", it is likely that larger disk radii than we conclude here would be acceptable .",
    "indeed , the strong constrains we place here based on this analysis may instead be an indication of a high degree of inclination for the orbit .",
    "since the inclination of gq lup a s disk , @xmath556 , is consistent with orbital solutions in @xcite and @xcite , here we investigate if the star s disk and the companion s orbit can be possibly in the same plane .    in figure",

    "@xcite argued that scattering might be the most favorable scenario for gq lup b where it originally formed close to the star , but was scattered outward by a more massive body .",
    "search for a close - in massive companion to the star have not yielded positive results .",
    "deep ao imaging in @xcite excluded any object as bright as gq lup b outside @xmath518 au .",
    "similarly , rv monitoring rejected objects massive than 0.1 @xmath14 within 2.6 au @xcite , but @xcite speculated that a massive brown dwarf might reside only a few au s from the star in order to explain their observed 0.4 km s@xmath37 rv change in two years .",
    "however , if such an inner object exists , morphology of gq lup a s disk can be used to infer its presence since it may sculpt a gap or hole .",
    "the inner edge of a circumbinary disk can be truncated at approximately 2 to 3 times the binary separation @xcite , corresponding to a @xmath510 au hole for the brown dwarf companion posited by @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "neither the 0.3  to 1.3 mm disk sed @xcite nor our alma 1.3 mm disk - resolved map find evidence of a gap or central clearing in the disk .",
    "thus , it is quite unlikely that another massive body is very close to the primary star to serve as the scatterer .",
    "in addition , scattering often induces a very eccentric orbit ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but for gq lup b , orbital solutions with low eccentricities are more probable , as shown in section [ section : tidaltruncation ] .",
    "therefore , all lines of observational evidence suggest that in situ formation via disk fragmentation or prestellar core collapse is more likely the formation pathway of gq lup b. this is in line with the null result of the dedicated ao search for scatterers in other systems @xcite ; thus , core accretion plus subsequent scattering is perhaps not responsible for most substellar companions on wide orbits .",
    "observationally distinguishing prestellar core collapse from disk fragmentation requires high - resolution imaging toward the earliest phase in star formation .",
    "recent studies suggest that prestellar core collapse can be effective to form very wide ( @xmath821000 au ) binary or multiple star systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while disk fragmentation may form more compact systems with separations of tens to hundreds of au between the components ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at @xmath5110",
    "au from the host star , gq lup b seems to fit nicely to the disk fragmentation scenario .    for fragmentation to occur ,",
    "gq lup a s disk must have been very massive and presumably more extended than 50 to 100 au , since circumstellar disks are expected to become gravitationally unstable beyond that radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is sometimes suggested that the disk plane and the companion s orbital plane should be coplanar because the companion formed in the disk .",
    "however , dynamical interactions with other fragments in the parent disk can gradually alter the initial configuration , thereby creating inclined systems @xcite . as a result , even though in section [ section : geometry ] we have shown that gq lup b s orbital plane is probably not coplanar with gq lup a s disk , disk fragmentation remains a possibility .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that properties of circumsubstellar disks provide an observational diagnostic to distinguish disk fragmentation from prestellar core collapse .",
    "they predicted higher disk masses and accretion rates for objects formed via disk fragmentation , because they have longer time to accrete and thus retain a more massive disk .",
    "the discrepancy between the two scenarios is more profound for very low - mass companions , especially @xmath1110 @xmath8 .",
    "the authors also predicted that , under the disk fragmentation framework , low - viscosity circumsubstellar disks tend to have masses and accretion rates higher than that of high - viscosity ones , because higher viscosity facilitates angular momentum transport and disk dissipation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gi ] we overplot substellar companions fw tau c , gsc 6214 - 210 b , and gq lup b on the figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "objects formed by disk fragmentation have a roughly constant disk mass , in drastic contrast to the monotonic correlation @xmath176 for prestellar core collapse . while fw tau c has a rather massive disk , considering the large dispersion in the @xmath176 correlation ( @xmath810.7 dex ; @xcite ) , it is still consistent with both formation scenarios .",

    "thus , it appears that gq lup b has no gaseous moons , while a few earth - like moons may have formed in early times when the disk was more massive . as @xcite and our alma observations find that gq lup b s disk is deficient in dust , forming earth - like satellites is no longer possible . only tiny rocky moons analogous to the moon ( @xmath50.012 @xmath7 ) may still form out of the remaining material ( @xmath110.04 @xmath7 ) .",

    "<S> we report the alma 1.3 mm and magellan adaptive optics ( magao ) h@xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 observations of the gq lup system , a classical t tauri star with a 1040 @xmath4 substellar companion at @xmath5110 au projected separation . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the accretion rates for both components from the observed h@xmath0 fluxes . in our @xmath5@xmath6 resolution alma map , </S>",
    "<S> we resolve gq lup a s disk in dust continuum , but no signal is found from the companion . </S>",
    "<S> the disk is compact , with a radius of @xmath522 au , a dust mass of @xmath56 @xmath7 , an inclination angle of @xmath556 , and a very flat surface density profile indicative of a radial variation in dust grain sizes . </S>",
    "<S> no gaps or inner cavity are found in the disk , so there is unlikely a massive inner companion to scatter gq lup b outward . </S>",
    "<S> thus , gq lup b might have formed in situ via disk fragmentation or prestellar core collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that gq lup a s disk is misaligned with its spin axis , and possibly with gq lup b s orbit . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis on the tidal truncation radius of gq lup a s disk suggests that gq lup b s orbit might have a low eccentricity . </S>"
