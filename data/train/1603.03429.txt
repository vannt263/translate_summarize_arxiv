    "as our knowledge of physics improves , more and more the general theory of relativity is showing to be a fundamental theory . among many important results that could be listed ,",
    "the recent detection of gravitational waves by the ligo experiment @xcite is just one example .    although , when considering non - gravitational interactions there are still some questions to be answered .",
    "an interesting aspect to be observed is the preferential role of the gravitational interactions in this theory , as all interactions are coupled to the gravity by the gravitational constant _",
    "g _ in the right - hand side of the einstein equations .",
    "a fundamental question is if the gravitational interaction really is a preferential kind of interaction or if all interactions may be considered in an equivalent way .",
    "another question that may be posed is how a system where the gravity is negligible if compared with the other kinds of interactions may be considered in a geometrical approach",
    ". some interesting results of these ideas at the quantum level have been shown in @xcite and @xcite . in this work , this possibility will be studied and the formulation of the basic ideas will be made in terms of the interaction of a point - like particle with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the theory of general relativity ( gr ) describes the gravitation as a geometrical effect . in this way , in absence of non - gravitational forces , any particle will follow a geodesic path on a given curved space - time ( hereafter s - t ) as described by the geodesic equation [ geod ] + = 0 .",
    "being a geometrical effect , it implies that the evolution of each particle in a gravitational field is independent on their characteristics such as charge , mass or spin .",
    "a different situation is the case of a charged particle interacting with an electromagnetic field ( hereafter ) , in which the trajectory is determined by [ force ] + = f^ , where @xmath0 is the mass of the particle and @xmath1 is the lorentz force which depends on the particle s charge .",
    "then , when introducing interactions other than gravitation in the usual formulation of gr , the dynamics of particles is not ( completely ) described in geometrical terms .    in this work ,",
    "we want to _ effectively _ describe the electromagnetic interaction as a geometrical phenomena .",
    "that is , we begin with the assumption that the path followed by a charged particle in presence of an , correspond to a geodesic in a certain curved s - t , which we will call the particle s proper space - time ( ) . thinking in this way , each particle is in free fall in its own s - t , which must necessarily depend on the interaction between the particle and its environment ( the external fields ) .",
    "then , we must carefully distinguish between this abstract s - t ( the ) and the s - t which is perceived by the observer in the laboratory ( our s - t ) .",
    "we will call this last one the background space - time ( ) .    to our knowledge",
    ", there is no theory at present which totally describes the electromagnetic interaction in a geometric way .",
    "many people have care about this issue , moved for example by einstein s spirit which in its own words is :  the idea that there are two structures of space independent of each other , the metric - gravitational and the electromagnetic , is intolerable to the theoretical spirit \" ( aspden @xcite , and barnett @xcite ) .",
    "hermann weyl ( pauli @xcite , see also @xcite ) , developed a generalized version of riemann geometry to describe the electromagnetism in a geometrical way .",
    "even though it was a very deep theory in which he has able to obtain the maxwell equations by just using geometry , this formalism was practically abandoned , as it predicts some effects which are not consistent with observations ( pauli @xcite )    it s not the purpose of this work to give a geometric description of electromagnetism , but just to gain some insights on how to proceed in order to effectively describe the interaction of a charged particle and an .",
    "some useful results can be obtained with this approach as it was done for example , in the work of barros @xcite , in which by using the spherical symmetry in the interaction of electron with a proton in the hydrogen atom , he managed to obtain a minkowski - like metric and it allows him to obtain the spectrum of the system which is very close to the observed one .",
    "this work is organized in four sections . in section 1 .",
    "we make the weak field approximation and the limit of small velocity to get a first relationship between the metric of the , the external  and the particle mass and charge .",
    "section 2 .",
    "sets the main ideas on how to obtain the metric for the  in more general cases .",
    "section 3 and 4 .",
    "give the applications of the present formalism and its comparison with the results of the special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "in the last section the conclusions will be drawn .",
    "the first step in order to construct the  is to determine it in the weak field limit and its relation with a flat s - t , in a way similar to the one that is done in the general relativity theory .",
    "+ in the weak field approximation we can think of the  as described by a metric @xmath2 which is a small perturbation of the . for simplicity we shall take this  to be flat and so described by the minkowski metric @xmath3 [ g ] g_=_+h",

    "then , in terms of @xmath186 , yields 3cdt= , 3c(t - t_0)=2+u^2/3|^u_u_0 with @xmath187 the value of @xmath186 at @xmath188 . taking @xmath189 , and using again the variable @xmath108",
    "we get @xmath190 this equation gives the time as a function of the position .",
    "however we can isolate the variable @xmath108 as a function of time , and the reader can check that this leads to 1 + 3z=-1 + + ^3/2 , with @xmath191    figure [ fig : geodesics ] shows a set of geodesics for different initial conditions : @xmath192 .",
    "the cases @xmath193 and @xmath194 , start with negative velocity and approach to the return point ( in this case , the origin ) , then go back to the @xmath195 region .",
    "the other case is for initial conditions @xmath196 and @xmath197 , so they are always moving away from the origin .",
    "the initial velocities for each case , can be obtained from = , which yields @xmath198        in this plot we explicitly see that due to the initial conditions and the return position , the particle never approach the region @xmath199 ( here @xmath200 , this makes the  described by free of singularities .",
    "we see also that basically each curve is equal to the other up to a displacement , this agrees with translational invariance as we would expect .",
    "in this work we have introduced the concept of  as a geometric tool to describe the interaction between a punctual particle and an electromagnetic external field . in this formalism",
    "we have considered the particle path as being a geodesic in a curved space - time , and so , the electromagnetic force could be understood in a purely geometric way .    with those considerations we have seen in section [ lorentz ] that the geodesic equation in the  leads to the lorentz force in the limit of weak field and small velocities .",
    "this allowed us to relate the metric in the  with the em potential . in section [ ch : campofmn ]",
    "we have proposed general statements about the characteristics a the  beyond the weak field approximation which allowed us to make some applications in section [ sec : appl ] . in particular , we have obtained the field equations that define this geometry which are similar to the einstein s equations , where in general , the energy - momentum tensor have information of both , the particle and the external field .",
    "we have seen however , that those field equations violate gauge invariance , as they are only valid in a specific gauge .",
    "this is a question that must be studied more carefully and will be left for future works .",
    "we have also confirmed that the present treatment is compatible with sr in the limit of small velocities and weak fields ( see section [ comparing ] ) , that means that the general behavior of the particle has been obtained .",
    "an interesting result is that it is possible to find connexions to the usual formulation , and the conditions in order to observe these connections are determined .",
    "thinking in these terms , the proposed theory may be seen as a generalization of the usual theory ."
