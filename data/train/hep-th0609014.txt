    "orbifold compactifications have played a prominent role in string theory ever since their advent in  @xcite ,  @xcite . over the years , toroidal orbifolds have served as simple models to test new structures and phenomena in string theory such as dualities . moreover",
    ", they provide a rich playground for phenomenologial studies of semi  realistic string compactifications .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate more recent issues such as properties of orientifold compactifications and the ensuing @xmath0 low energy effective field theories as well as the stabilization of the moduli in these theories .    the initial impulse for the present paper arose from the search for orientifold compactifications in type iib string theory which allow the complete stabilization of all khler moduli .",
    "the occurrence of a large number of moduli , i.e. free parameters in the low energy effective field theory , is a malady that most commonly used string compactifications suffer from . in  @xcite , a mechanism ( kklt )",
    "was proposed that stabilizes the dilaton and all geometrical moduli and moreover leads to a meta ",
    "stable de sitter vacuum .",
    "the complex structure moduli and the dilaton are stabilized via background 3form fluxes , whereas the khler moduli are fixed via non  perturbative effects : a superpotential is generated either via euclidean d3brane instantons wrapping a divisor in the compactification manifold  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , or by a gaugino condensate in the world ",
    "volume of d7branes wrapping such a divisor  @xcite ,  @xcite . for both mechanisms ,",
    "the divisors in question must fulfill certain topological properties : to be able to decide whether the khler moduli can be stabilized for a given compactification manifold , the knowledge of the topology of a full set of divisors , as well as the intersection ring , which enters the tree ",
    "level khler potential are needed .",
    "moreover , we need to know which khler moduli become non  geometric and which complex structure moduli disappear after the orientifold quotient , respectively .    to date , only few explicit examples which realize the proposed mechanism of moduli stabilization exist  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 orbifold was resolved and the f ",
    "theory lift of the correspondinging orientifold quotient provided indeed a working example for moduli stabilization  la kklt .",
    "a natural question then is whether the results of  @xcite extend to more general toroidal orbifolds , which are generically less symmetric and carry more non ",
    "trivial features than @xmath1 . to answer this question",
    "we have developed geometric methods for analyzing the topology of resolved orbifolds .",
    "since these methods are of general interest and lend themselves to many more applications than only those given by the initial motivation discussed above , a study dedicated to this subject exclusively is justified .",
    "an outline of this program was given in  @xcite .",
    "its application to the issue of moduli stabilization and in particular to the answer to the above question is given in our companion paper  @xcite .",
    "our paper builds the bridge between the moduli stabilization at the orbifold point in  @xcite and at the large volume limit in  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "it is in particular shown how to stabilize the non  geometric khler moduli .    with the methods discussed in the present paper , a given toroidal orbifold can be resolved to yield a smooth calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "while the methods of toric geometry allow us to resolve the singularities locally , the knowledge of the structure of the covering space , i.e. the @xmath2 , allows us to glue the resolved patches together in the correct fashion .",
    "we are able to determine the topology of all divisors that arise naturally in our construction .",
    "moreover we explain how to determine the full intersection ring of the resulting calabi  yau manifold . in a second step ,",
    "we provide the transition to the orientifold quotient .",
    "this quotient corresponds from a geometric point of view to a @xmath3 quotient of the smooth calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning , toroidal orbifolds have already lent themselves to numerous applications in string theory in the past .",
    "one one hand , this is due to their simple structure which they inherit from the covering torus , while on the other hand they exhibit the non  trivial nature of a generic calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "the lesson is that the singular orbifold quotient is merely a special , degenerate point in the moduli space of a smooth calabi ",
    "yau manifold and that this smooth manifold is actually the object of interest .",
    "it is the construction of this object that we focus on , as well as the transition to the orientifold quotient .",
    "the orientifold quotient is the relevant object for all models in type ii string theories featuring d  branes .",
    "we provide explicit examples of models where the number of geometric moduli is reduced after taking the quotient , i.e. models with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : orbifolds ] , we briefly discuss the different possible orbifold constructions . in section  [ sec : local ] , the resolution of the orbifold singularities in a local set - up using the methods of toric geometry is treated . in section  [ sec : toric ] , the necessary background in toric geometry is given and the resolution process explained . in section  [ sec : exceptop ] , we state how to determine the topology of the divisors in the local resolved geometries . in section  [",
    "sec : localexamples ] , we apply these techniques to explicitly perform the resolution of the singularity of @xmath6 .    while the material in the preceding sections is mostly standard , sections  [ sec : global ] and  [ sec : orientifolds ] form the core part of the new material presented in this paper . in section  [ sec : global ] , we give the general method of constructing a smooth calabi ",
    "yau manifold from the resolved local patches discussed in the previous section . in section  [ sec : fixedsets ] , the fixed point configurations of the singular orbifold and the counting of the exceptional divisors arising from the resolution are reviewed . in section  [ sec : intersectionring ] , we show how to obtain the linear relations among the divisors in the global model and present the method to calculate the full intersection ring of the smooth calabi  yau manifold , albeit not necessarily in an integral basis . with the knowledge of the preceding section we can demonstrate in section  [ sec : topology ] how to determine the topology of these divisors . in section",
    "[ sec : twistedcplx ] , we shed light on the origin of the twisted complex structure moduli , a topic on which so far only very little is known . as in section",
    "[ sec : local ] we apply these general methods in section [ sec : globalexamples ] to the examples of @xmath7 on the root lattices of @xmath8 and @xmath9 and two @xmath1 shift orbifolds .",
    "the transition from the smooth calabi ",
    "yau manifold to its orientifold quotient is made in section  [ sec : orientifolds ] . in section",
    "[ sec : actions ] , we consider the global orientifold involution and its relation to the involutions on the local patches .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the occurrence of divisors which are not invariant under the global involution , leading to @xmath10 , and of complex structure moduli which are invariant , leading to @xmath5 .",
    "both of them are non  geometric moduli . in section  [ sec : oring ] we explain how the intersection ring of the orientifold quotient is obtained from the one of the calabi  yau manifold .",
    "the global configuration of the orientifold  plane and the resulting charges , which have to be canceled are discussed in section  [ sec : tadpoles ] .",
    "the orientifold quotients of some of the examples of section  [ sec : globalexamples ] conclude the topic .",
    "we end with concluding remarks and a brief outlook in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : toricpatches ] , the resolutions of all the local orbifold singularities which we encounter in the examples are collected .",
    "the remaining appendices give the details of a few more examples , namely @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 on several lattices , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "a fundamental problem in string theory is the classification of string compactifications .",
    "@xmath16 theories in four dimensions can be obtained as compactifications of type ii string theories on calabi  yau manifolds .",
    "therefore we need a list of calabi  yau manifolds .",
    "we will focus on a particular class of such manifolds , namely resolutions of torus orbifolds . in this section , we will review the present content of this list and indicate to which part we will restrict ourselves in the remainder of the article . for compiling this list , we need topological criteria to decide which calabi  yau manifolds are equivalent .    an important but expensive calculational tool to settle the question of possible equivalences is the classification of real six manifolds by c.t.c .  wall @xcite . applied to calabi ",
    "yau manifolds it states that two simply connected manifolds @xmath17 and @xmath18 are of the same topological type , i.e. are diffeomorphic , if besides the hodge numbers , the triple intersection numbers @xmath19 and the linear forms @xmath20 are the same , possibly up to an integer linear basis transformation @xmath21 in the khler cone of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if the bases can only be related by a rational linear transformation , the spaces are rational homotopy equivalent . only finitely",
    "many diffeomorphic types can exist in a rational homotopy equivalence class .    to date",
    "there is no complete classification of torus orbifolds and their resolutions in three dimensions . for several simple classes there are partial classifications .",
    "coxeter orbifolds with @xmath22 abelian and not containing any shifts were classified in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the latter also take into account discrete torsion .",
    "however , there are also examples of non  coxeter orbifolds , e.g. in  @xcite . for abelian orbifolds including shifts",
    "there is a result in  @xcite .",
    "the classification by borcea and voisin in  @xcite and  @xcite of calabi  yau threefolds with involutions coming from automorphisms of k3s has a partial overlap with the previous two classifications .",
    "to our knowledge , there is no classification for @xmath22 non  abelian with or without shifts . in two dimensions ,",
    "there is a classification of torus orbifolds without shifts by fujiki  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the statements of these partial classifications are of differing richness . while all of them state the allowed groups and their actions , some of them also determine topological quantities like the euler number , the hodge numbers , or even the intersection ring .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and  @xcite provide the hodge numbers , while  @xcite does not .",
    "voisin  @xcite even explicitly calculates the intersection ring of the manifolds in her list . in the following two sections we present a general method to determine the topology of resolutions of abelian torus orbifolds , including the intersection ring , the linear forms @xmath23 and the topology of the divisors . for a discussion of the relation between the vanishing of @xmath23 and torus orbifolds",

    ", we will consider two orbifolds with @xmath82 with one , respectively two shifts included which were introduced in  @xcite .",
    "they are related to the schoen calabi ",
    "yau manifold  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) with @xmath83 , and to the enriques calabi  yau manifold  @xcite ,  @xcite with @xmath84 .",
    "in this section , we examine the resolution of the singularities of toroidal orbifolds . close to an orbifold fixed point , which is a quotient singularity , the geometry looks like @xmath85 .",
    "this non - compact local geometry is conveniently described as a toric variety",
    ". we will not give the full definitions here but refer the reader to the literature , chapter 7 of  @xcite for example gives an easily accessible introduction , and  @xcite for the necessary details .",
    "we will give the description of these local orbifolds in terms of their fans , resolve the singularities by blowing up the orbifold fixed points and give the intersection properties along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "a systematic way to resolve abelian orbifold singularities is toric geometry  @xcite . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we summarize some of the basic facts about toric geometry .",
    "an @xmath86dimensional toric variety takes the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 , and the algebraic torus @xmath89 acts by coordinatewise multiplication .",
    "the set @xmath90 is a subset that remains fixed under a continuous subgroup of @xmath89 and must be subtracted for the variety to be well defined .",
    "the action of @xmath89 is encoded in a lattice @xmath91 which is isomorphic to @xmath92 and by its fan @xmath93 .",
    "a fan is a collection of strongly convex rational cones in @xmath94 with the property that each face of a cone in @xmath93 is also a cone in @xmath93 and the intersection of two cones in @xmath93 is a face of each .",
    "the @xmath95dimensional cones in @xmath93 are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the codimension @xmath95submanifolds of @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , the one  dimensional cones correspond to the divisors in @xmath96 . the fan @xmath93 can be encoded by the generators of its edges or one  dimensional cones , i.e. by vectors @xmath97 . to each @xmath98",
    "we associate a homogeneous coordinate @xmath99 of @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath89 action is encoded on the @xmath98 in @xmath100 linear relations @xmath101 to each @xmath98 we assign an invariant monomial @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is an element of the lattice dual to @xmath91 .",
    "these monomials are the local coordinates of @xmath96 .",
    "we are only interested in calabi ",
    "yau orbifolds @xmath104 of dimensions @xmath105 , so we require @xmath96 to have trivial canonical class .",
    "this translates to demanding that all but one of the @xmath98 lie in the same affine hyperplane one unit away from the origin @xmath106 .",
    "this means that the last component of all the @xmath98 ( except @xmath106 ) equals one .",
    "thus , the @xmath98 form a cone @xmath107 over the polyhedron @xmath108 spanned by the @xmath98 , @xmath109 with apex @xmath106 .",
    "this allows us to draw toric diagrams in two ( one ) dimensions instead of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the fan @xmath93 associated to the singularity @xmath85 is obtained as follows : we have a single three ",
    "dimensional cone in @xmath93 , generated by @xmath112 .",
    "a generator @xmath113 of @xmath22 of order @xmath86 acts on the coordinates of @xmath114 by @xmath115 for such an action we will adopt the shorthand notation @xmath116 . the calabi - yau condition is trivially fulfilled as the orbifold actions are chosen such that @xmath117 and @xmath118 . then the local coordinates of @xmath96 are @xmath119 . to find the coordinates in @xmath91 of the generators @xmath98 of the fan , we require the @xmath120 to be invariant under the action of @xmath113 .",
    "this results in finding two linearly independent solutions to the equation @xmath121 the divisors corresponding to the 1dimensional cones @xmath98 will be denoted by @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath96 is smooth if all the top  dimensional cones in @xmath93 have volume one . here",
    ", there is only one such cone whose volume is @xmath123 , hence @xmath96 is singular .",
    "there is a standard procedure for resolving singularities of toric varieties .",
    "it consists of adding all lattice points in @xmath91 which lie in the polyhedron @xmath108 in the affine hyperplane at distance one which is spanned by the generators @xmath98 .",
    "adding points only in this hyperplane ensures that the the canonical class of the variety is not affected , i.e. the resulting manifold is still calabi  yau .",
    "for the fan @xmath93 this means that the corresponding one  dimensional generators @xmath124 are added to it and that it has to be subdivided accordingly .",
    "we denote the refined fan by @xmath125 . in",
    "@xcite it is shown that these new generators can be related ( in the case @xmath110 ) to the group elements of @xmath22 as follows : @xmath126 where @xmath127 represents the corresponding group element @xmath128 .",
    "the corresponding exceptional divisors are denoted @xmath129 .",
    "to each of the new generators we associate a new homogeneous coordinate which we denote by @xmath130 , as opposed to the @xmath131 we associate to the original @xmath98 .",
    "let us pause for a moment to think about what this method of resolution means .",
    "the obvious reason for enforcing the criterion  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) is that group elements which do not respect it fail to fulfill the calabi ",
    "yau condition : their third component is no longer equal to one . but what is the interpretation of these group elements that do not contribute ?",
    "another way to phrase the question is : why do not all twisted sectors contribute exceptional divisors ?",
    "a closer look at the group elements shows that all those elements of the form @xmath132 which fulfill  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) give rise to inner points of the toric diagram .",
    "those of the form @xmath133 lead to points on the edge of the diagram .",
    "they always fulfill  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) and each element which belongs to such a subgroup contributes a divisor to the respective edge , therefore there will be @xmath134 points on it .",
    "the elements which do not fulfill  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) are in fact anti  twists , i.e. they have the form @xmath135 .",
    "since the anti  twist does not carry any information which was not contained already in the twist , there is no need to take it into account separately , hence also from this point of view it makes sense that it does not contribute an exceptional divisor to the resolution .",
    "the case @xmath111 is even simpler .",
    "the singularity @xmath136 is called a rational double point of type @xmath137 and its resolution is called a hirzebruch  jung sphere tree consisting of @xmath134 exceptional divisors intersecting themselves according to the dynkin diagram of @xmath137 .",
    "the corresponding polyhedron @xmath138 consists of a single edge joining two vertices @xmath139 and @xmath140 with @xmath134 equally spaced lattice points @xmath141 in the interior of the edge . after having added the generators , we have to subdivide the fan .",
    "the subdivision of the fan @xmath93 into @xmath125 corresponds to a triangulation of the toric diagram . in general , there are several triangulations , and therefore several possible resolutions .",
    "they are all related via birational transformations .",
    "the diagram of the resolution @xmath142 of @xmath143 contains @xmath123 simplices , yielding @xmath123 three - dimensional cones of volume one .",
    "hence @xmath142 is smooth .",
    "this variety can , of course , also be written in the form  ( [ eq : toricvariety ] ) where @xmath100 is now the number of additional generators @xmath124 .",
    "their defining relations  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) are , after clearing the denominators , precisely the @xmath100 linear relations  ( [ eq : linrels ] ) which encode the @xmath144 action .",
    "the divisors corresponding to such a linear combination are `` sliding divisors '' in the compact geometry , as we will discuss in great detail in section  [ sec : intersectionring ] .",
    "finally , the excluded set @xmath90 is obtained as follows : take the set of all combinations of generators @xmath98 and @xmath124 of one  dimensional cones in @xmath93 that _ do not span a cone _ in @xmath93 and define for each such combination a linear space by setting the coordinates associated to the @xmath98 to zero .",
    "@xmath90 is the union of these linear spaces , i.e. the set of simultaneous zeros of coordinates not belonging to the same cone . in the case of several possible triangulations , it is the excluded set @xmath145 that distinguishes the different resulting geometries .    in the dual diagram ,",
    "the geometry and intersection properties of a toric manifold are often easier to grasp than in the original toric diagram .",
    "the divisors , which are represented by vertices in the original toric diagram become faces in the dual diagram , the curves marking the intersections of two divisors remain curves and the intersections of three divisors which are represented by the faces of the original diagram become vertices . in the dual graph , it is immediately clear which of the curves are compact .",
    "the curves at the intersection of two exceptional divisors are the exceptional curves .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a matrix @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 contains as its rows the vectors @xmath98 and @xmath124 ; the columns of @xmath148 contain the linear relations  ( [ eq : linrels ] ) between the divisors , i.e. @xmath149 . from the rows of @xmath148 , which we denote by @xmath150 , we can read off the linear equivalences between the divisors .",
    "( note that two divisors @xmath151 and @xmath152 are linearly equivalent if and only if they are homologically equivalent . ) for most applications , it is most convenient to choose the @xmath153 to be the generators of the mori cone .",
    "the mori cone is the space of effective curves , i.e. the space of all curves @xmath154 with @xmath155 for all divisors @xmath156 .",
    "it is dual to the khler cone . in our cases ,",
    "the mori cone is spanned by curves corresponding to two  dimensional cones .",
    "the generators for the mori cone correspond to those linear relations with which all others can be expressed as positive , integer linear combinations .",
    "we will briefly review the method of finding the generators of the mori cone .",
    "it can be found e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "we present it here adapted to our context .    1 .   in a given triangulation ,",
    "take the three - dimensional simplices @xmath157 ( corresponding to the three - dimensional cones ) .",
    "take those pairs of simplices @xmath158 that share a two  dimensional simplex @xmath159 .",
    "2 .   for each such pair",
    "find the unique linear relation among the vertices in @xmath160 such that 1 .",
    "the coefficients are minimal integers and 2 .",
    "the coefficients for the points in @xmath161 are positive .",
    "3 .   find the minimal integer relations among those obtained in step 2 such that each of them can be expressed as a positive integer linear combination of them .",
    "next , we want to investigate the intersection properties of the divisors of the resolved variety @xmath142 .",
    "the general rule for triple intersections is that the intersection number of three distinct divisors is 1 if they belong to the same cone and 0 otherwise .",
    "the set of collections of divisors which do not intersect because they do not lie in the same come forms a further characteristic quantity of a toric variety , the stanley",
    " reisner ideal .",
    "it contains the same information as the exceptional set @xmath162 .",
    "intersection numbers for triple intersections of the form @xmath163 or @xmath164 can be obtained by making use of the linear equivalences between the divisors .",
    "since we are working here with non  compact varieties at least one compact divisor has to be involved . for intersections in compact varieties",
    "there is no such condition .",
    "the intersection ring of a toric variety is  up to a global normalization  completely determined by the linear relations and the stanley",
    " reisner ideal .",
    "the normalization is fixed by one intersection number of three distinct divisors .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath148 are the intersection numbers between the curves @xmath153 and the divisors @xmath165 .",
    "we can use this to determine how the compact curves of our blown  up geometry are related to the @xmath153 .",
    "there are two types of exceptional divisors depending on whether the the corresponding point lies in the interior or sits on the boundary of the toric diagram .",
    "the latter case can easily be discussed by looking at the dual toric diagram.we see that it corresponds to the two  dimensional situation with an extra non  compact direction , hence it has the topology of @xmath166 .",
    "we therefore turn to the divisors corresponding to points in the interior of the toric diagram .",
    "for that purpose we recall the notion of the star of a cone @xmath167 , denoted @xmath168 , which is the set of all cones @xmath169 in the fan @xmath93 containing @xmath167 . in our situation , the topology of an exceptional divisor @xmath129",
    "is then determined in terms of @xmath170 .",
    "this means that we simply remove from the fan @xmath93 all cones , i.e. points and lines in the toric diagram , which do not contain @xmath124 .",
    "the diagram of the star does not need to be convex anymore .",
    "then we compute the linear relations and the mori cone for the star .",
    "this means in particular that we drop all the simplices @xmath157 in the induced triangulation of the star which do not lie in its toric diagram . as a consequence",
    ", certain linear relations of the full diagram will be removed in the process of determining the mori cone .",
    "the generators of the mori cone of the star will in general be different from those of @xmath93 .",
    "once we have obtained the mori cone of the star we can rely on the classification of compact toric surfaces .",
    "this tells us that any toric surface is either a @xmath171 , a hirzebruch surface @xmath172 , or a toric blow - up thereof .",
    "the generator of the mori cone of @xmath171 is of the form @xmath173 for @xmath172 the generators take the form @xmath174 since @xmath175 is isomorphic to @xmath172 .",
    "finally , every toric blow - up of a point adds an additional independent relation whose form is @xmath176 we will denote the blow - up of a surface @xmath177 in @xmath86 points by @xmath178 .    also the exceptional divisors corresponding to points on the boundary of the toric diagram can be dealt with using the star . since the geometry is effectively reduced by one dimension , the only compact toric manifold in one dimension is @xmath179 and the corresponding generator is @xmath180 where the 0 corresponds to the non - compact factor @xmath181 .",
    "however , this is not yet the full story , since our toric variety @xmath182 is actually three - dimensional . in particular , the stars are in fact cones over a polygon .",

    "we do not need to look at all elements , since some of them are merely the anti - twists of others and therefore give rise to the same fixed sets .",
    "since the fixed points were determined on the covering space , we have to check if they all give rise to distinct equivalence classes . except for the prime orbifolds , i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath264 ,",
    "this is in general not the case .",
    "some of the fixed points are mapped to other fixed points by some group element and are therefore identified in the quotient .",
    "when we will count the number of exceptional divisors , i.e. @xmath26 , below , it is crucial to only count one divisor per equivalence class . in the following ,",

    "to get an idea of how exactly the local patches will be glued , it is useful to have a schematic picture of the configuration , i.e. the intersection pattern of the singularities . in this picture , each complex coordinate is shown as a real coordinate axis and the opposite faces of the resulting cube of length 1 are identified .",
    "the fixed point loci are represented by their projections to the real coordinates .    in some cases ,",
    "not all information that will be necessary for us later will be captured by looking at the fixed sets under a single group element .",

    "this case is the only instance of intersecting fixed lines where the intersection point itself is not fixed under a single group element , and arises only for @xmath266 orbifolds with both @xmath86 and @xmath267 even .",
    "we now perform the blowups of the local patches as described in section  [ sec : toric ] and appendix  [ sec : toricpatches ] , glue the patches together and figure out the number of divisors in the compact model .    the divisors are either inherited from the divisors of the covering torus or originate from the blow - ups of the fixed loci under the group action .",

    " 2 in  @xcite .",
    "the orbifold group acts on these forms by @xmath270 .",
    "therefore , we immediately see that the three forms @xmath271 are invariant and descend to forms on the orbifold .",
    "if , in addition , it happens that for all generators @xmath272 @xmath273 simultaneously for some @xmath274 , then we get an additional pair of 2forms on the orbifold .",

    "( [ eq : twistfour ] ) and @xmath191 for which @xmath279 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : twistsixi ] ) .    for the exceptional divisors we need to consider the fixed loci which , as we have seen in the previous section , are either fixed lines or fixed points .",
    "the corresponding toric patches of the blown  up fixed loci are all determined along the lines of section 2 and can be found in appendix [ sec : toricpatches ] .",
    "the fixed lines come from twists of the form @xmath280 or cyclic permutation thereof .",
    "the corresponding singularities locally have the form of @xmath281 . in the global setting ,",
    "the singular loci are @xmath282 curves of such @xmath281 singularities where @xmath283 , the order of the orbifold group @xmath22 in @xmath265 .",
    "the possible values for @xmath95 are @xmath284 , and @xmath285 .",
    "the fixed points come from twists of the form @xmath286 which locally look like @xmath287 .",
    "isolated fixed points correspond to toric diagrams with only internal , compact exceptional divisors .",
    "when the fixed point sits on a fixed line of order @xmath95 , its toric diagram has @xmath288 exceptional divisors on one of its boundaries , if the fixed point sits at the intersection of two ( three ) fixed lines , it has exceptional divisors on two ( three ) of its boundaries . in our examples ,",
    "the twists occur either in their standard embeddings or permutations thereof .",
    "the permutations merely interchange the coordinates , the number and configuration of exceptional divisors remains the same as in the standard form .",
    "we are now presenting the count of the exceptional divisors for all our examples .",
    "most cases are straightforward .",
    "there are only two possible complications : one is that the lines fixed under several group elements lie on the same locus . the correct way of counting them is to always count the fixed line of highest order .",
    "the other is that several fixed points under different group elements lie in the same loci .",
    "there are actually two different ways of counting them , one of which requires no knowledge whatsoever of the form of the local patches .",
    "it is enough to know the loci and conjugacy classes of the fixed points .",
    "for this first method , we simply count each fixed point as many times as it arises under the different group elements .",
    "this automatically gives the right number .",
    "the second method involves the toric patches as given in the above tables . to decide which of the patches of the group elements that leave the point invariant to use , we look if the point sits on any ( intersection of ) fixed line(s ) .",
    "we choose the patch with the right configuration of exceptional divisors on its boundaries to match the order of the fixed lines it sits on .",
    "so if the fixed point sits for example on the intersection of two order two and one order six fixed lines , we choose the @xmath289patch with one , one and five exceptional divisors on its boundaries .",
    "the patch contributes exactly the number of compact exceptional divisors one would expect from the first counting scheme , so the two methods are consistent .",
    "there is a purely combinatorial way to determine the intersection ring of the resolved torus orbifold .",
    "this method is completely analogous to the one in section  [ sec : toric ] . recall that there we determined the intersection numbers between three distinct divisors , as well as those divisors which never intersect , and then used the linear relations to compute all the remaining intersection numbers . in the global situation",
    "we proceed in the same manner .",
    "the inherited divisors @xmath290 and the exceptional divisors @xmath291 together form a basis for the divisor classes of the resolved orbifold .",
    "this basis is in general not an integral basis . in addition , there are further natural divisors which will be expressed in terms of linear combinations of these basis elements",
    ". these additional divisors are simply planes lying at fixed loci of the orbifold action : @xmath292 , where @xmath293 runs over the fixed loci in the @xmath294th direction . in terms of the local toric patches they correspond to the non - compact divisors",
    "@xmath122 , e.g. in ( [ eq : pq ] ) .",

    "consider the local toric patch before blowing up .",
    "the fixed point lies at @xmath302 and in the limit as @xmath303 approaches this point , we find the relation between @xmath290 and @xmath122 to be @xmath304 .",

    "the local topology of the divisors in the cases  e[item : e2 ] ) and  e[item : e3 ] ) has also been discussed in that section , and found to be ( a blow  up of ) @xmath401 .",
    "the @xmath181 factor is the local description of the @xmath282 curve on which there were the @xmath281 singularities whose resolution yielded the @xmath179 factor .    for the determination of the topology of the resolved curves , it is necessary to know the topology of @xmath282 .",
    "this can be determined from the action of @xmath402 on the respective fundamental domains . for @xmath403",
    ", there are four fixed points at @xmath404 , and @xmath405 for arbitrary @xmath169 .",
    "the fundamental domain for the quotient can be taken to be the rhombus @xmath406 $ ] and the periodicity folds it along the line @xmath407 $ ] .",
    "hence , the topology of @xmath408 without its singularities is that of a @xmath179 minus 4 points .",
    "for @xmath409 the value of @xmath169 is fixed to be @xmath410 , respectively , and the fundamental domains are shown in figure  [ fig : fundomains ] .    , @xmath409 .",

    "e[item : e2 ] ) , there are no further fixed points , so the blow  up procedure glues in points in this @xmath179 .",
    "the topology of such an exceptional divisor is therefore the one of @xmath411 . in the case",
    "e[item : e3 ] ) , the topology further depends on the possible fixed points lying on these fixed lines .",
    "this depends on the choice of the root lattice for @xmath265 , and can therefore only be discussed case by case .",
    "this will be done in the examples in section  [ sec : globalexamples ] and in all the appendices .",
    "the general procedure consists of looking at the corresponding toric diagram .",
    "there will always be an exceptional curve whose line ends in the point corresponding to the exceptional divisor .",
    "( in the example @xmath6 discussed in section  [ sec : z6-i ] , this is the curve @xmath412 in the diagram on the left hand side of figure  [ fig : fstarsixi ] . )",
    "this exceptional curve meets the @xmath179 ( minus some points ) we have just discussed in the missing points and therefore the blow  up adds in the missing points .",
    "any further lines ending in that point of the toric diagram correspond to additional blow ",
    "ups , i.e. additional @xmath179s that are glued in at the missing points .",
    "therefore , for each fixed point lying on the fixed line and each additional line in the toric diagram , there will be a blow  up of @xmath413 .",
    "if there are @xmath325 elements in the equivalence class of the fixed line , the topology in the case  e[item : e2 ] ) is quite different .",
    "this is because the @xmath325 different @xmath282s are mapped into each other by the corresponding generator in such a way that the different singular points are permuted .",
    "when forming the invariant combination by summing over all representatives , the singularities disappear and we are left with a @xmath414 . hence , in the case  e[item : e2 ] ) without fixed points , the topology of @xmath415 is @xmath416 .",
    "similarly , the topology of the divisors @xmath312 depends on the structure of the fixed point sets lying in the divisor .",
    "recall that these divisors are defined by @xmath417 .",
    "the orbifold group @xmath22 acts on these divisors by @xmath418 for @xmath419 and @xmath420 . since @xmath421",
    ", the resolved space will not be a calabi ",
    "yau manifold anymore , but a rational surface or a ruled surface over a @xmath414 .",
    "this is because for resolutions of this type of actions , the canonical class can not be preserved .",
    "( in more mathematical terms , no crepant resolution exists . ) in order to determine the topology , we will use a simplicial cell decomposition , remove the singular sets , glue in the smoothening spaces , i.e. perform the blow  ups , and use the additivity of the euler number .",
    "this has to be done case by case .",
    "if , in particular , the fixed point set contains points , there will be a blow  up for each fixed point and for each line in the toric diagram of the fixed point which ends in the point corresponding to @xmath122 .",
    "another possibility is to apply the techniques of toric geometry in section  [ sec : toric ] to singularities of the form @xmath136 for which @xmath422 .",
    "as before , we also have to take into account whether the equivalence class of the fixed point set defining @xmath423 consists of a single element or more .    note that when embedding the divisor @xmath423 into a ( calabi  yau ) manifold @xmath17 in general , not all the divisor classes of @xmath423 are realized as classes in @xmath17 . in the case of resolved torus orbifolds , this is because the underlying lattice of @xmath423 is not necessarily a sublattice of the underlying lattice of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the fixed point set of @xmath423 as a @xmath424 orbifold can be larger than the restriction of the fixed point set of the @xmath2 orbifold to @xmath423 . in order to determine the topology of @xmath423 we have to work with the larger fixed point set of @xmath423 as a @xmath424 orbifold .",
    "it turns out that there is always a lattice defining a @xmath2 orbifold for which all divisor classes of @xmath423 are realized in @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , we observe that the topology of all those divisors which are present in several different lattices is independent of the lattice .",
    "the divisors @xmath290 contain by definition no component of the fixed point set .",
    "however , if fixed lines are present , they can intersect fixed lines in points . if there are no fixed lines piercing them , the action of the orbifold group is free and their topology is that of a @xmath424",
    ". otherwise , the intersection points have to be resolved in the same way as for the divisors @xmath312 . in this case , their topology is always that of a k3 surface .    we can also use the intersection ring to study the topology of these divisors .",
    "if we describe the divisor @xmath177 ( which can be of any type , i.e. @xmath425 , @xmath400 or @xmath423 above ) of the calabi  yau manifold @xmath17 by an embedding @xmath426 then we have the associated short exact sequence for the tangent bundles @xmath427 and @xmath428 and the normal bundle @xmath429 of @xmath177 in @xmath17 : @xmath430 by the adjunction formula  @xcite @xmath431 , we can relate the topology of @xmath177 to that of @xmath17 .",
    "expanding @xmath432 and using the restriction formula @xmath433 , we obtain @xmath434 which gives the relation between the chern classes of @xmath177 and the topological numbers of @xmath17 . furthermore",

    "since we already determined the topology of the divisors @xmath290 , @xmath312 and @xmath365 , i.e. the euler numbers @xmath436 and @xmath439 , we can cross  check them with the self  intersection numbers in the intersection ring .",
    "we can also explicitly check the number of blow ",
    "ups of @xmath177 . on one hand , it is known  @xcite that the holomorphic euler characteristic is a birational invariant , which means that it does not change under blow  ups . on the other hand",
    "we know that blowing up a surface adds a 2cycle to it , hence increases the euler number @xmath439 by 1 .",
    "therefore , the self ",
    "intersection number @xmath440 is decreased by 1 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath440 restricted to @xmath177 becomes @xmath441 , where @xmath442 is the canonical divisor of @xmath177 .",
    "like @xmath436 and @xmath439 , @xmath443 is a characteristic quantity of an algebraic surface @xmath177 .",
    "we have collected these three numbers for the basic topologies that we found above in the following table : @xmath444 the invariants of the blow ",
    "ups of these surfaces are then obtained from the above observations .",
    "the second use of  ( [ eq : s3 ] ) is to determine @xmath445 in  ( [ eq : c2.s ] ) from the topology of @xmath177 .",
    "there are two types of complex structure deformations . loosely speaking",
    ", we can deform the complex structure of the underlying torus with a given lattice , or we can deform the fixed point set .",
    "the former type of deformation corresponds to the untwisted complex structure moduli at the orbifold point while the latter correspond to the twisted complex structure moduli .",
    "the deformations of the complex structure of the underlying tori has been studied in great detail in  @xcite .    to study the twisted complex structure moduli we therefore have to look at the fixed point set .",
    "isolated fixed points do not admit any complex structure deformations .",
    "hence , we need only consider fixed lines .",
    "however , if there are fixed points on them , their complex structure again can not be deformed .",
    "so , we are left with fixed lines without fixed points . in the previous section ,",
    "we have argued that after resolving the singularities they yield exceptional divisors which are ruled surfaces over a @xmath179 or a @xmath414 .",
    "these ruled surfaces can also be viewed as an algebraic family of algebraic curves ( here rational curves @xmath179 ) parametrized by the base curve @xmath187 . for any smooth complex projective threefold @xmath17 with such a family of algebraic curves",
    "there is a map @xmath446 which sends the 1cycle @xmath399 on @xmath187 to the 3cycle @xmath447 traced out by the fiber curve @xmath448 as @xmath449 traces out @xmath399  @xcite . since the fibers @xmath448 are algebraic cycles , the dual map on the cohomology respects the hodge decomposition and yields a map @xmath450 . for our varieties",
    "@xmath187 is either a @xmath179 or a @xmath414 .",
    "since @xmath451 and @xmath452 , only the ruled surfaces over @xmath414 give such a map .",
    "hence we find that @xmath453 where the sum runs over the curves @xmath153 with topology @xmath414 parametrizing exceptional curves which come from the resolution of @xmath454 singularities .",
    "to reiterate in plain language , each equivalence class of order @xmath86 fixed lines without fixed points on them contributes as many twisted complex structure moduli as the fixed line has @xmath179 components in its resolution , namely @xmath134 .",
    "this is precisely the situation e[item : e2 ] ) in section  [ sec : topology ] .",
    "we note that this situation has a well  known analogue for hypersurfaces in toric varieties . in that case",
    "the complex structure deformations split into polynomial and nonpolynomial ones .",
    "the former correspond to deformation of the hypersurfaces while the latter corresponds to deformations of a certain ambient toric variety .",
    "the nonpolynomial deformations also come from curves of @xmath136 singularities .",
    "after resolution of the singularities these become families of @xmath179s parametrized by the curve , in other words , ruled surfaces and a similar reasoning applies  @xcite .        in order to find the fixed point sets , we need to look at the @xmath113 , @xmath455 and @xmath197twists . @xmath456 and",
    "@xmath457 yield no new information , since they are simply the anti  twists of @xmath455 and , @xmath113 .",
