    "since the seminal work of hawking [ 1 ] and bekenstein [ 2 ] , we have understood that black holes behave as thermal objects containing characteristics such as temperature , entropy and etc . hawking radiation has not yet been directly observed , of course ; a typical stellar mass black hole has a hawking temperature of well under a micro - kelvin , far lower than that of the cosmic microwave background temperature @xmath5 .",
    "however the thermal properties of black holes are studied in the literature and there is well understood that they have temperature @xmath6 and entropy @xmath7 in the above equations @xmath8 is the horizon surface area , @xmath9 is the corresponding surface gravity which is constant over the event horizon , @xmath10 is newtons coupling constant and @xmath11 is plank coupling constant .",
    "one can obtain value of the surface gravity by applying the second law of the black hole thermodynamics : @xmath12 where @xmath13is the angular velocity and @xmath14 is the electric potential on the horizon . also ",
    "@xmath15  and  @xmath16  is electric charge and mass of the black hole respectively .",
    "the surface area of the event horizon of a black hole never decreases so that @xmath17 in a typical thermodynamic system , temperature is a measure of average energy of microscopic constituents ; entropy counts the number of microstates and etc .",
    "however one can see that the bekenstein - hawking entropy depends on both planks and newtons constants and so statistical mechanic description of black hole thermodynamics might be tell us something profound about quantum gravity [ 3,4 ] .",
    "+ in this article , we study thermodynamics of the rn spherically symmetric static black hole ( charged schwarzschild black hole ) .",
    "we calculate temperature @xmath18 and heat capacity @xmath19 exhibiting with ",
    "@xmath4-transition type of second order on the critical hyper - surface @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes to volume of the rn black hole ( see figures 1,2,3 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-transition type is happened usually at low critical temperatures as @xmath22 for liquid helium .",
    "the transition goes between two liquid phase , both in equilibrium with a gas phase .",
    "liquid @xmath23 exhibits a second order transition which can be interpreted as a bose - einstein condensation modified by strong interatomic interactions . below the critical temperature",
    "the liquid is a  superfluid  which appears to have zero viscosity and manifests quantum behavior on a macroscopic scale ( see [ 5 ] page 152 ) .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "+ in section 2 we called rn black hole metric as an spherically symmetric static metric solution of einstein - maxwell equation . also we obtain its thermodynamic state equation where the electromagnetic field source treats as dark matter perfect fluid with negative barotropic index @xmath24 in section 3 we derive temperature and heat capacity of the rn black hole by applying the bekenstein - hawking entropy theorem .",
    "section 4 denotes to summary and discussion of the paper .",
    "the rn spherically symmetric static space time is metric solution of the einsteins equations @xmath25 where@xmath26 is stress energy tensor of electromagnetic field @xmath27 with nonzero components @xmath28 given in units @xmath29 this stress tensor treats same as anisotropic dark perfect fluid with equation of state as @xmath30 where dark matter density @xmath31 and pressure @xmath32 is defined in terms of the stress tensor components such as follows .",
    "@xmath33 which for diagonal stress tensor one can obtain radial pressure @xmath34 and transverse ( tangential ) pressure @xmath35 as @xmath36 corresponding metric solution described in @xmath37 coordinates system is obtained as @xmath38 where @xmath16 is the @xmath39 mass and @xmath15 is the electric charge .",
    "there is an event horizon at @xmath40 and a cauchy horizon at @xmath41 all of horizons ( event , apparent and cauchy ) exist for @xmath42 with particular choice @xmath43 ( lukewarm type of rn black hole ) we have @xmath44 with @xmath45 the rn metric solution ( 2.5 ) leads to schwarzschild metric and we will have @xmath46 [ 6,7 ] . in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to a typical situation @xmath47 for which the horizon equation @xmath48 corresponds to a black hole horizon located at the hyper - surface @xmath49 then we study rn black hole temperature and heat capacity at constant charge @xmath50 volume @xmath51 and temperature @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the rn black hole space time is a spherically symmetric static charged black hole with no electric current density @xmath53 and so ( 1.3 ) reduces to the following form .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is black hole temperature in units @xmath56 , ",
    "@xmath57  is surface gravity and @xmath58 is electric potential . using ( 3.1 ) and",
    "the horizon radius ",
    "@xmath40  for which surface area of the event horizon become @xmath59 one can obtain exactly , the rn black hole temperature and electric potential respectively such as follows .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 which are real functions with @xmath62 we are now in position to obtain heat capacity of the rn black hole as @xmath63 where we defined @xmath64 one can show simply that the re - scaled heat capacity @xmath65 diverge to infinity at critical value @xmath66 [ 8 ] .",
    "this result agrees with the work of davies [ 9 ] and so appears that there is a phase transition of the rn black hole at the critical point @xmath67 . in the case of lukewarm type its temperature and also heat capacity",
    "is eliminated .",
    "the black hole system with positive heat capacity can be in equilibrium with a surrounding heat bath .",
    "but the black hole become disequilibrium with negative heat capacity and so radiates its energy [ 9 ] .",
    "the equation ( 3.3 ) shows that the electric potential has not singular point and so there is not exist infinite discontinuity in the electric potential ( see also eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) in ref .",
    "but meitei et al are shown in ref .",
    "[ 11 ] , that the electric potential at constant temperature @xmath68 exhibits with a discontinuity at the critical point @xmath69 furthermore they claimed that this discontinuities may be merely an artefact of the change in the slope of the @xmath70 vs. @xmath16 curve when @xmath71 and so the rn black hole dose not exhibited really with phase transition .",
    "+ however this problem is maintained still as questionable . hence we seek phase transition property of the system here by deriving the rn black hole heat capacity defined in terms of its temperature and volume such as follows .",
    "the equation ( 3.2 ) can be rewritten as @xmath72 the rn black hole volume can be written as @xmath73 eliminating mass parameter @xmath16 between ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) we obtain @xmath74 applying ( 3.8 ) , the temperature ( 3.6 ) become @xmath75 inserting ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) the equations ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) leads to the following relation .",
    "@xmath76 which is independent of charge quantity @xmath15 .",
    "the above heat capacity takes an infinite value on the critical hyper - surface @xmath77inserting ( 3.11 ) the relation ( 3.8 ) corresponds to the condition @xmath78 applying ( 3.12 ) , the equations ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) leads to the following relations respectively . @xmath79 and @xmath80 corresponding to critical radius ( the apparent horizon radius ) @xmath81{\\frac{3v_c}{4\\pi}}=r_{+}(m , x_c)=\\frac{3m}{2}$ ] ( see eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) ) .",
    "one can rewrite dimensionless form of the heat capacity ( 3.10 ) such as follows .",
    "@xmath82 in which @xmath83 is dimensionless temperature and volume of the rn black hole .",
    "asymptotic behavior of the heat capacity ( 3.15 ) at high temperatures become @xmath84 which is independent of temperature .",
    "the above negative heat capacity corresponds to disequilibrium radiating hot mini rn black hole @xmath85 at low temperatures we obtain @xmath86 corresponding to fat cooled rn black hole @xmath87 which is in equilibrium with a surrounding heat bath .",
    "diagram of the dimensionless heat capacity ( 3.15 ) is plotted against dimensionless temperature @xmath88 in figure 1 for particular constant volumes @xmath89 ( dot line ) , @xmath90 ( dash line ) and @xmath91 ( solid line ) respectively .",
    "heat capacity ( 3.15 ) is plotted against dimensionless temperature @xmath88 at constant dimensionless volume @xmath89 ( dot line ) , @xmath90 ( dash line ) and @xmath91 ( solid line ) respectively .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    it shows that ",
    "@xmath4-transition type of second order phase transition . comparing the curves given in figure 1",
    ", one can result that the phase transition can be happened at low temperature for fat cooled rn black hole @xmath92 also one can obtain same results for heat capacity at constant temperature @xmath93 exhibiting with  @xmath4-transition type at high temperatures for mini hot rn black hole ( see figure 2 ) .     heat capacity ( 3.15 ) is plotted against dimensionless volume @xmath94 at constant dimensionless temperatures @xmath95 ( dot line ) , @xmath96 ( dash line ) and @xmath97 ( solid line ) respectively . ,",
    "width=302,height=264 ]    negative temperatures in figure 3 corresponds to negative heat capacity of the rn black hole as well as positive temperatures .",
    "negative temperatures have several features physically .",
    "for instance bose - einstein condensation phase transition at negative temperature are happened [ 12 ] .",
    "dark matter perfect fluid with negative pressure corresponds boson fields with negative temperatures which can be support big rip singularity of the expanding universe in the finite future [ 13 ] . also negative temperature can be create an attractively interacting ensemble of ultra - cold bosons which are stable against collapse for arbitrary atom numbers [ 14 ] ( see also [ 15 ] ) .",
    "heat capacity ( 3.15 ) is plotted against dimensionless volume @xmath94 and dimensionless temperature @xmath88 .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]",
    "the transition from negative to positive values in the heat capacity can be characterized by critical exponents obeying the scaling laws [ 11,16 ] . however the quantum analogue of supper - radiance makes it difficult to treat rigorously the physical peculiarities caused by the singular behavior of heat capacity [ 9,17 ] .",
    "the thermodynamic analogy in the black holes physics , which we have discussed here for rn type of black holes with arbitrary mass @xmath16 , has so far been confined to equilibrium thermodynamics on the critical hypersurface @xmath98 for instance second order ",
    "@xmath4-transition of the rn black hole heat capacity at constant volume treats same as phase transition of liquid helium ( see figures 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the liquid @xmath23 contains two liquid phase , both in equilibrium with a gas phase at low temperatures [ 5 ] .",
    "originally the phase transition phenomena comes from disequilibrium thermodynamics which describes irreversible transitions of a system between its states and the processes taking place when the system passes to the state of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "a general analysis of the problems of disequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes can be found in [ 18,19,20,21](see also [ 3 ] ) . in this article",
    "we result that sigh of heat capacity of a single rn black hole is changed and there is happened a double  @xmath4  type second order phase transition at regime @xmath99 defined on the critical hypersurface @xmath100 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "hence one can ask a question : do exhibit ensembles of rn mini black holes with phase transitions ? what is quantum approach of the problem under consideration ? as a future work we try to obtain a suitable answer to these questions by regarding ideas presented by chevalier et al [ 22 ] about mean metric of ensembles of black holes .",
