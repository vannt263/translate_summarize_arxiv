    "this element expires at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the window size or length .",
    "the sliding window model is useful for moving object search , stock analysis or sensor network analysis , where only recent events may be important and reduces memory requirements because only a small window of data is used .      in this paper ,",
    "a new method called @xmath9 has been proposed , that generates the predicted values for the original stock time series data . here ,",
    "we first perform preprocessing upon the historical stock time series data to generate the sequence of approximated values using multi scale segment mean approach @xcite . then , we use these approximated sequence of values for the predicting process .",
    "to forecast , we use the euclidian distance approach to find the nearest neighbor objects to identify the similar set of objects as used in @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath9 is estimated by computing the percentage of error based on the difference between the predicted value and the actual known value for each test samples .",
