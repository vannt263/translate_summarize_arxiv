    "it is well known that to solve an electrodynamic problem external with respect to a metal , one can use the impedance boundary conditions @xcite @xmath0 ,     \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the tangential components of electric and magnetic vectors at the metallic surface ; @xmath3 is the unit external normal vector to the surface of the metal ; @xmath4 is the two - dimensional surface impedance tensor .",
    "its real and imaginary parts define the dissipated energy and the phase shift of the reflected electromagnetic wave respectively ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "if for an inhomogeneous metal the penetration depth of an electromagnetic wave @xmath5 is much less than a characteristic size @xmath6 of the surface inhomogeneity , omitting the terms of the order of @xmath7 , the local values of the impedance can be used in the boundary conditions ( 1 ) . in this case eqs.(1 ) are usually called the local leontovich ( the impedance ) boundary conditions @xcite . the surface inhomogeneity can be due to the inhomogeneity of the properties of the metal or / and the surface roughness .",
    "the elements of the local surface impedance tensor of an inhomogeneous metal are functions of position on the surface .",
    "if the metal surface is rough , the components of the unit vector @xmath3 depend on position too .",
    "the more complex is the geometry and composition of the surface , the more complex is the solution of the problem .",
    "when the surface inhomogeneity is strong , the solution requires cumbersome numerical calculations .",
    "the structure of electromagnetic fields in the immediate vicinity of the inhomogeneous metallic surface is very complex too .",
    "the fields above the surface are represented by incident , reflected , scattered and evanescent waves . however , sometimes it is sufficient to know the reflected electromagnetic wave only , not going into details of the field distribution near the surface .    in",
    "what follows , when calculating we assume that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vacuum wavelength .",
    "when inequalities ( 2 ) are fulfilled , only the fields averaged over the surface inhomogeneities `` survive '' far ( at the distance much greater than the vacuum wavelength ) from a stochastically or periodically inhomogeneous metallic surface . to calculate these fields ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the effective surface impedance relating the tangential averaged fields at a plane close to the real metallic surface ( or coinciding with this surface , if the surface of the metal is flat ) .",
    "we define the effective impedance tensor with the aid of equations similar to eqs.(1 ) for a homogeneous metal with the flat surface , let us say , @xmath10 : @xmath11 ; \\eqno ( 3)\\ ] ] @xmath12 is the unit normal vector to this plane , @xmath13 denote an average over the plane @xmath10 . in the case of a stochastically inhomogeneous surface",
    "the averaging is carried out over the ensemble of realizations of the inhomogeneities ; if the inhomogeneity is a periodic one , the brackets denote the average over the period . if the tensor @xmath14 is known , when calculating the averaged electromagnetic fields we return to the reflection problem from a homogeneous flat surface .",
    "the general way providing the correct result for the effective impedance is to derive equations for the averaged electromagnetic fields both in the metal and in the medium over the metal ( we assume it to be vacuum ) , as well as the boundary conditions for these fields at the metal - vacuum interface . by proceeding from these equations",
    "the tensor @xmath14 can be calculated .",
    "the similar method is used rather often when calculating effective characteristics of inhomogeneous media .",
    "it goes back to the pioneering works of i.m.lifshitz and his co - authors .",
    "however , mostly this regular method is applicable when the inhomogeneity amplitude is small and the perturbation theory can be used ( with regard to the calculation of the effective impedance see @xcite ) .",
    "the exact solutions for effective characteristics of strongly inhomogeneous media can be found very rarely .",
    "one of examples is the calculation of the effective static conductivity of some two- dimensional inhomogeneous metals @xcite .",
    "the other example is a quite new result for the effective surface impedance of an inhomogeneous metal with flat surface @xcite .",
    "it is valid in the frequency region of the local impedance boundary conditions applicability .",
    "recently this solution was used when calculating the effective impedance of strongly anisotropic polycrystalline metals both under the conditions of normal @xcite and anomalous skin effect @xcite .    in @xcite the expression for the effective impedance",
    "was obtained with the aid of the general scheme .",
    "herein we present much more straightforward reasoning leading to the same result and extend it to the case of rough metallic surfaces .",
    "this result is a nonperturbative one with respect to the inhomogeneity amplitude .",
    "it is exact up to the limits of the local impedance boundary conditions ( 1 ) applicability .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "some general remarks useful when calculating the effective impedance are given .",
    "in section 3 the simple way to derive the expression for @xmath15 in the case of flat inhomogeneous surfaces is presented . as an example , we analyze in details the case of one - dimensional strongly nonhomogeneous periodic strip - like local impedance . in section 4",
    "we present the algorithm allowing us to calculate the effective impedance in the case of one - dimensional rough surface .",
    "the obtained formulas are used to calculate the effective impedance associated with a lamellar grating . the s- and",
    "p - polarization states are examined separately .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "suppose the local impedance tensor @xmath4 is a known .",
    "a plane wave @xmath16 is incident upon the surface from the region @xmath17 .",
    "the metal occupies the volume beneath the plane @xmath18 .",
    "the surface of the metal is assumed to be the plane @xmath18 itself , or it is the plane @xmath19 perturbed by a roughness .",
    "for the sake of definiteness we suppose that the surfaces does not stand out over the plane @xmath10 .",
    "suppose the surface inhomogeneity is a stochastic or a periodic one .",
    "for a rough surface its profile is defined .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be the total electromagnetic vectors in the region @xmath22 .",
    "we extract the averaged electric and magnetic vectors : @xmath23 if @xmath24 , the fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent mainly evanescent waves damping at the distances of the order of @xmath6 above the surface . when @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a distance complying with the inequality @xmath29 , the leading terms in the expressions for the total fields are equal to their averaged values : @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electric and magnetic vectors of the reflected wave respectively .",
    "suppose we are interested in the averaged fields only . since no inhomogeneous parameters enter the maxwell equations in the vacuum , the averaging of these equations provides the standard maxwell equations for the averaged fields .",
    "our problem is to obtain the boundary conditions for the averaged fields with the aid of the exact eqs.(1 ) . comparing the last with eqs.(3 ) , we define the effective impedance . in what follows",
    "we solve this problem , reducing it to calculation of the magnetic field in the vicinity of infinitely conducting surface of the same geometry .    to start the calculation",
    ", we remind that the elements of the tensor @xmath4 are of the order of the ratio @xmath33 . consequently , in accordance with eqs.(1 ) , the tangential components of electric vector at the metallic surface are much less then the tangential components of magnetic vector .    next , at the surface of a metal the magnetic vector @xmath2 is approximately equal to the magnetic vector @xmath34 at the surface of a perfect conductor ( @xmath35 ) of the same geometry .",
    "the same is true in the immediate vicinity of the metallic surface .",
    "then at the plane @xmath19 @xmath36 @xmath37 is two - dimensional position vector at the plane @xmath19 . with regard to eqs.(1 ) the first nonvanishing term in the expression for the tangential electric vector @xmath1 at the metallic surface is @xmath38 .",

    "these small terms can not be taken into account in the framework of the local leontovich boundary conditions and , consequently , the averaged electric field can not be calculated more accurately .    in the case of a flat inhomogeneous metallic surface eqs.(3 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6.2 ) allow us to calculate the effective impedance .",
    "the obtained result can not be improved .",
    "it is exact up to the limits of local impedance boundary conditions applicability .",
    "the equations ( 5 ) and ( 6.1 ) allow us to define the effective impedance for a rough metallic surface too .",
    "however , the method of calculation is not so straightforward ( see section 4 ) .",
    "when the aforesaid argumentation is taken into account , the result of @xcite for the effective impedance of an inhomogeneous metal with a flat surface , @xmath43 is almost obvious .",
    "indeed , in the case of normal incidence of an electromagnetic wave upon the flat surface @xmath18 of a perfect conductor the magnetic vector at the surface is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the amplitude of the magnetic field of the incident wave .",
    "this vector does not depend on position at the surface .",
    "thus , with the aid of eqs.(5 ) and ( 6.2 ) we have : @xmath46 .",
    "\\eqno ( 8)\\ ] ] comparing eqs.(8 ) with eqs.(3 ) , we obtain eq.(7 ) .",
    "this result is correct for any metal with inhomogeneous flat surface both under the conditions of normal and anomalous skin effect .",
    "suppose the local impedance tensor of an isotropic inhomogeneous metal is one - dimensional periodic strip - like function : @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , where @xmath49 @xmath50 is the period .",
    "all the parameters , namely , @xmath6 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the local impedances is @xmath53 , @xmath54 are compatible with inequalities ( 2 ) .",
    "we use this example not only to illustrate how simple the effective impedance can be calculated with the aid of eq.(7 ) , but also to visualize the difference between the fields in the immediate vicinity of one - dimensional inhomogeneous metallic surface for the s- and p- polarization states .    with regard to eq.(7 ) for both polarizations the effective impedance is @xmath55 however , the difference between the polarizations exhibits itself in the values of the fields near the surface . to complete the picture , for both polarizations",
    "we calculate the fields above the metal and the time- averaged pointing vector @xmath56}/4\\pi$ ] defining the time - averaged energy flux .",
    "the continuity equation for this vector , @xmath57 , represents the energy conservation law ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "let the magnetic vector of the incident wave be @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the only nonzero component of the total magnetic vector above the metal can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the amplitude of the reflected wave and @xmath61 represents the evanescent waves .",
    "with regard to the maxwell equations the components of the electric vector are @xmath62 @xmath63 we see that to calculate the components of the electric vector @xmath64 up to the terms of the order of @xmath65 allowed in the framework of the local impedance boundary conditions applicability , we need to know the amplitudes of the evanescent waves @xmath66 ( @xmath67 up to the terms of the order @xmath68 .    according to eqs.(1 ) in the p - polarization state @xmath69 .",
    "we fourier analyze this equation making use of eqs.(11 ) and ( 12.1 ) .",
    "then , omitting the terms of the order of @xmath70 , we obtain the coefficients @xmath66 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 . as a result up to the terms of the order of @xmath65 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 we introduce @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the real and the imaginary parts of the function for an arbitrary @xmath80 , but trying to be short we do not present here the relevant expressions . ] @xmath81 of the complex argument @xmath82 : @xmath83    note , all the corrections taking into account the finite conductivity of the metal are of the order of the input impedances @xmath84 and @xmath54 .",
    "next , the expression for the magnetic field , eq.(14.1 ) , is just the same as if calculated for the p - polarized wave incident upon a homogeneous metallic surface with the impedance @xmath15 .",
    "however , the evanescent waves contribute to the electric field . in equations ( 14.2 ) and",
    "( 14.3 ) they are represented by the terms including the functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these terms are exponentially small when @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) .    from eqs.(14 )",
    "it follows that for the p - polarization state up to the terms of the order of @xmath65 the pointing vector @xmath89(the superscript @xmath90 indicates the polarization ) can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 far from the surface ( @xmath87 ) the component @xmath93 of the pointing vector is exponentially small , and the component @xmath94 .",
    "at the surface @xmath95 and the component @xmath96 is defined by the local impedance : @xmath97 , if @xmath98 and @xmath99 , if @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to see that along with eq.(16 ) the components of the vector @xmath101 can be written as @xmath102 where the vector @xmath103 and @xmath104    from eq.(16 ) it follows that in the p - polarization state in addition to equation @xmath105 we also have @xmath106 .",
    "thus , in the p - polarization state the vector @xmath107 satisfies the same set of equations as the electric vector in two - dimensional electrostatic problems . making use of this analogy we introduce a complex potential @xmath108 for the pointing vector @xmath109 : @xmath110 at the plane @xmath111 equations @xmath112 define the equipotential lines for",
    "the vector @xmath109 , and equations @xmath113 define the force lines of this vector .",
    "evidently , far from the surface ( @xmath114 ) the force lines are parallel to the @xmath115 axis . near the surface ( @xmath116 )",
    "they are distorted due to the influence of evanescent waves .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us examine the limiting case of very strong inhomogeneity : @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "with regard to eq.(10 ) the relevant effective impedance is @xmath120 , and according to eq.(19 ) the complex potential is @xmath121 the force lines corresponding to this potential are given by equations @xmath122 where @xmath123 defines the position of the given line far from the surface .",
    "these force lines are shown in fig.1 ( full lines ) .",
    "all the lines being distributed uniformly far from the surface , meet at the point @xmath124 on the surface .",
    "immediately near the surface the force lines are the straight lines @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "it can be easily verified that the complex potential defined by eq.(20.1 ) is the same as the electrostatic complex potential of the system of charged straight lines that are perpendicular to the plane @xmath127 and intersecting this plane at the points @xmath128 .",

    "the total electric vector above the metal is @xmath130 @xmath131 is defined in eq.(11.2 ) ; @xmath132 corresponds to the reflected wave and @xmath133 represents the evanescent waves .    to define the fourier coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath134 we use the boundary conditions ( 1 ) .",
    "omitting the terms of the order of @xmath135 , we obtain @xmath136 ( compare with eq.(13 ) ) .",
    "then in terms of the variables @xmath137 and @xmath115 our result for the fields above the surface is @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140    in contrast to the p - polarization state the evanescent waves contribute both to the electric and magnetic fields near the metallic surface .",
    "next , the contributions of evanescent waves to the components of the magnetic vector are of the order of @xmath141 ( compare with eqs.(14 ) ) .    of course , in accordance with the energy conservation law in the s- polarization state the components of the time - averaged pointing vector satisfy the equation @xmath142 .",
    "the curl of this vector is not equal to zero and , consequently , in the s - polarization state no complex potential can be introduced .    to define the equation for the force lines of the vector @xmath143",

    "@xmath123 defines the position of the line far from the surface .",
    "immediately near the surface the force lines are the straight lines @xmath149 . for the given value @xmath123 the slope @xmath150",
    "is defined by the equation @xmath151 these force lines are shown in fig.1 ( dashed lines ) .    summarizing the results of this section we would like to emphasize that the main difference between the two polarizations is the presence of the terms of the order of @xmath152 in the expressions for the components of the magnetic vector in the s - polarization state .",
    "in this section we show that if the metallic surface is rough , to calculate the effective impedance it is sufficient to know the magnetic vector @xmath153 near the surface of a perfect conductor of the same geometry .",
    "the main problem is to calculate the components of this vector . in the general case they depend on the surface geometry and , as a rule , on position at the surface .    we restrict ourselves with one - dimensional rough homogeneous metallic surfaces only . to be definite ,",
    "let us suppose that our one - dimensional surface is a periodic one , @xmath50 is the period .",
    "a part of the surface is the plane @xmath10 itself , and each period has a deepening with a throat of the length @xmath154 ( fig.2a ) .    in the case of the p - polarization state",
    "we calculate the relevant element of the effective impedance tensor for an arbitrary surface profile . for the s - polarization state",
    "we perform the calculation for one - dimensional lamellar gratings .",
    "we use this example to show the difference between the polarizations .    to show the method of calculation ,",
    "let us suppose that we know the vector @xmath153 for a given surface profile . with regard to the definition ( 3 ) of @xmath15 and eq.(4.2 ) we have that far from the surface ( @xmath155 ) the fields are the same as the ones above a flat metallic surface with the impedance equal to @xmath15 .",
    "this means that far from the surface the only nonzero component of the time- averaged pointing vector is @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the amplitude of the magnetic field in the incident wave . on the other hand , since near a metallic surface",
    "the magnetic vector @xmath158 is nearly the same as @xmath153 , at the rough metallic surface itself the time - averaged pointing vector is @xmath159 @xmath3 is the unit external normal vector to the surface ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy conservation law requires @xmath160 , and , consequently , the energy fluxes through the infinitely distant surface and the surface of the metal are equal",
    ". then @xmath161 the integration is carried out along one period of the line bounding the surface at the @xmath127 plane .",
    "the last equation enables us to calculate the real part of the effective impedance . to calculate @xmath162 we take into account that",
    "though no absorption happens when an electromagnetic wave reflects from a rough surface of the perfect conductor , a phase shift takes place . in other words ,",
    "some pure imaginary surface impedance can be associated with the rough surface of the perfect conductor .",
    "it is easy to understand that its leading term is of the order of @xmath163 ( we remind that @xmath164 ) . since @xmath165 ,",
    "in the case of the finite conductivity the same pure imaginary surface impedance defines the leading term in the expression for @xmath162 .",
    "now , supposing that @xmath166 , with the aid of eq.(3 ) we can define @xmath162 as the ratio of the tangential electric and magnetic fields averaged across the plane @xmath10 .",
    "the result for the averaged tangential magnetic vector is rather obvious .",
    "indeed , eq.(3 ) have the form of the boundary conditions for a flat metallic surface .",
    "consequently , the leading term in the expression for the averaged tangential magnetic field is @xmath167 .",
    "this statement is true both for a metallic surface and the surface of the perfect conductor .",
    "next , when @xmath166 , only the throat of the deepening contributes to the averaged electric field : @xmath168 if the magnetic vector @xmath153 is known , the last integral can be calculated with the aid of the stokes theorem or one of its modifications ( see below ) .    concluding this subsection we would like to note , that the components of the vector @xmath153 depend on the parameter @xmath164 ( see eq.(2 ) )",
    "we show that when calculating the leading terms of @xmath169 and @xmath162 , we need to know the field @xmath153 up to the terms independent of this small parameter only .",
    "in what follows p- and s- polarization states are examined separately .",
    "let us start with the p - polarization state ( the magnetic vector @xmath171 is parallel to the rulings ) .",
    "with regard to our notations the relevant element of the effective impedance tensor is @xmath172 .",
    "it is easy to see that when a p - polarized wave is incident upon one- dimensional rough surface of a perfect conductor , and the characteristic sizes of the surface profile are compatible with inequalities ( 2 ) , in the vicinity of the surface the expression for the magnetic field @xmath173 can be written as @xmath174 .",
    "( in appendix 1 we calculate @xmath173 for an infinitely conducting lamellar grating . )",
    "as far as the terms of the order of @xmath175 falls outside the framework of the local impedance boundary conditions applicability , the corrections @xmath176 has to be omitted when calculating @xmath177 with the aid of eq.(27.3 ) .    next , to calculate the averaged tangential electric field @xmath178 entering eq.(28 ) , we write the stokes theorem : @xmath179 =   \\oint{\\rm d}{\\bf r}{\\bf e}^{per}. \\eqno ( 29)\\ ] ] the integral in the left - hand side of eq.(29 ) is taken over the cross- section of the deepening ( @xmath180 ) ; the integral in the right - hand side is carried out in the clockwise direction over the contour and the throat of the deepening .",
    "now , taking into account that on the surface of the perfect conductor the tangential electric field is equal to zero , with the aid of the maxwell equations we obtain @xmath181 the integral in the right - hand side of eq.(30 ) is of the order of @xmath182 , @xmath183 is the area of the deepening . since according to eqs.(2 ) the value of @xmath184 , when calculating the leading term in the expression for @xmath185 we again use the approximation @xmath186",
    ".    let @xmath187 be the length of the surface contour with respect to one period .",
    "now , for an arbitrary shape of the deepening we can write the expression for the effective impedance leaving only the leading terms of @xmath177 and @xmath162 : @xmath188    we see that independently of the shape and the size of the deepening @xmath189 and @xmath190 , being of the order of @xmath191 multiplied by a characteristic size of the surface profile , is much greater than @xmath192 . from eq.(31 ) it follows that in the p- polarization state an intensification of absorption due to the surface roughness , is merely geometrical effect relating to an increase of the area of the absorbing surface .",
    "let us estimate the maximum value @xmath193 of @xmath194 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath193 corresponds to the maximum permissible value of the ratio @xmath195 .",
    "taking account of the inequalities ( 2 ) , suppose the length @xmath196 is of the order of the vacuum wavelength @xmath197 and the period @xmath50 is of the order of the penetration depth @xmath5 . then , since @xmath198 , we have @xmath199 .",
    "( we would like to recall that for good metals @xmath200 . )",
    "of course , this is only the upper bound of the permissible value of @xmath201 .",
    "however , the estimate shows that when the length of the contour is much greater then the period ( @xmath202 ) , the value of @xmath201 exceeds @xmath203 significantly .",
    "such increase of the effective impedance has to manifest itself as giant absorption of the incident p - polarized wave .",
    "the surface with @xmath202 can be realized , for example , in such a way .",
    "suppose a planar metallic surface has periodic grooves .",
    "suppose the boundary of the groove is a branching line ( fig.2.b ) .",
    "let us say , this line has a fractal structure .",
    "then the ratio @xmath204 can be very large and , consequently , the value of the @xmath205 close to @xmath193 can be achieved . when the throats of the grooves are sufficiently narrow , almost all absorption takes place inside `` the pockets '' beneath the plane @xmath10 .",
    "it is much more difficult to calculate the effective impedance relating to the s - polarization state ( the electric vector @xmath207 is parallel to the rulings ) . in our notations",
    "this is the element @xmath208 of the effective impedance tensor .",
    "the point is that for this polarization the magnetic vector @xmath153 varies significantly in the vicinity of the surface . inside the grooves",
    "the strength of the magnetic field exponentially decays when the distance from the plane @xmath19 increases .",
    "next , in contrast to the p- polarization state , evanescent waves generated in the region @xmath22 , contribute to the leading term of the tangential magnetic field @xmath209 . as a result even for rather simple surfaces , such as lamellar grating",
    ", the value of @xmath206 can be calculated only numerically .",
    "let us write down the general expression for @xmath206 .",
    "suppose the surface of the metal is of the type shown in fig.2a , and we know the vector @xmath210 in the vicinity of the surface",

    "there are some regular methods allowing us to calculate the magnetic vector at the surface of a perfect conductor in the small roughness limit .",
    "however , if the surface roughness is not small , analytical solutions can be obtained for some specific surfaces only .",
    "therefore , as an example , we examine an infinitely conducting lamellar grating ( fig.2c ) .",
    "we assume that all the sizes of the contour , namely the period @xmath50 , the width of the rectangular grooves @xmath154 , the depth of the grooves @xmath222 as well as @xmath52 , are in agreement with inequalities ( 2 ) .",

    "we must note that a similar problem was solved in @xcite by l.a.vainshtein , s.m.zhurav , a.i.sukov .",

    "however , the values of @xmath280 for deep ( @xmath271 ) grooves obtained in the present work ( the stars in fig.3a ) are approximately twenty percents less than the results of @xcite . trying to find out the origin of this discrepancy and to verify our approach , in @xcite we examined the system investigated in @xcite using two different approaches .",
    "we reproduced the perturbation theory calculations of @xcite with the aid of the modal functions method used in the present work .",
    "the results were the same as in @xcite .",
    "then we repeated the calculation with the aid of eq.(27.3 ) . comparing the results we obtained the same twenty percents difference .",
    "the analysis of @xcite showed that the only source of the discrepancy could be in application of the perturbation theory .",
    "unfortunately , we were not successful in detecting accurately why the standard perturbation theory used in @xcite and @xcite led to the results differing from the results obtained with the aid of our approach based on eq.(27.3 ) .",
    "however , we found some reasons allowing us to assume that in this problem the standard perturbation theory was not justified properly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to note that the aforementioned difference is not of principle for qualitative description of the results obtained when analyzing the reflection of s - polarized waves from lamellar gratings .",
    "on the basis of the local impedance boundary conditions ( 1 ) we examined several metallic systems with strong surface inhomogeneities . for each system",
    "we calculated the effective surface impedance tensor .",
    "our results are exact within the accuracy of eqs.(1 ) .",
    "if the surface of an inhomogeneous conductor is flat , the effective impedance is equal to the values of the local impedances averaged over the surface ( see eq.(7 ) ) . as an example",
    ", we examined a flat metallic surface with one - dimensional periodic strip - like local surface impedance . in this case",
    "the effective impedance is an isotropic tensor : @xmath281 ; @xmath15 is defined in eq.(10 ) .",
    "we analyzed the role of evanescent waves paying special attention to the difference between the p- and s - polarization states .",
    "we showed that in the p - polarization state the evanescent waves did not contribute to the magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the surface . on the contrary , in the s - polarization state",
    "just the evanescent waves provide the main contribution to the magnetic field taking account of the finite conductivity .    for this problem we also calculated the components of the time - averaged pointing vector @xmath282 . for normally incident waves the force lines of the vector @xmath282 being directed along the @xmath283 axis far from the surface ( @xmath284 ) become distorted near the surface .",
    "the stronger is the surface inhomogeneity , the more the distortion of the lines .",
    "we showed that in the p - polarization state the pointing vector was defined by the complex potential @xmath285 ( @xmath286 ) ( see eq.(19 ) ) .",
    "the aforementioned difference in the contribution of evanescent waves to the magnetic field is the reason why a complex potential can not be introduced in the s - polarization state .",
    "when the inhomogeneity is very strong ( narrow strips with rather large impedance separated by wide strips with very small impedance ) , for both polarizations all the force lines of the vector @xmath282 meet at the surface in the narrow regions where the local impedance is big ( see fig.1 ) . in the p - polarization state",
    "the equation for these lines is just the same as the equation for the force lines of the vector @xmath287 in the electrostatic problem for the periodic system of charged straight lines .    as an example of calculation of the effective impedance in the case of a conductor with rough surface we analyzed a periodic 1d surface of homogeneous isotropic conductor depicted in fig.2a . in this case",
    "the effective impedance is a tensor whose elements differ significantly , when the grooves are rather deep .    in the p - polarization state the electromagnetic field penetrates into the grooves on the surface . in our frequency region",
    "this means that the magnetic field @xmath173 is nearly constant in the immediate vicinity of the surface . as a result ,",
    "the surface as a whole takes part in absorption of p - polarized waves .",
    "this leads to a significant enlargement of absorption : the longer the length of the surface profile , the more the real part of the element of the effective impedance tensor relating to the p - polarization state ( see eq.(31 ) ) . in the framework of our approximation",
    "the upper bound for the real part of this element of the effective impedance tensor is of the order of one .",
    "the surfaces showing the giant absorption of p - polarized waves ( @xmath288 ) can be realized , for example , if the contour of the grooves is a strongly branching line .    in the s - polarization state evanescent waves",
    "contribute to the magnetic field in the vicinity of the surface . as a result at the surface",
    "the components of the magnetic vector @xmath153 depend on coordinates .",
    "the most important that inside the grooves all the fields decay exponentially with the increasing distance from the plane @xmath10 .",
    "no simple expressions for this element of the effective impedance tensor can be obtained . for each surface",
    "the calculation has to be done separately beginning from the calculation of magnetic field near the infinitely conducting surface of the same geometry .    as an example we examined the lamellar gratings shown in fig.2c .",
    "recently many authors studied scattering from surfaces having rectangular grooves .",
    "these surfaces are of interest because they can be manufactured very easily providing a possibility to check theoretical results .",
    "most of the investigations have been devoted to resonant enhancement processes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the frequency region examined in these works does not comply with the inequalities ( 2 ) defining the framework of the effective impedance approach applicability .",
    "our numerical results obtained when calculating the effective impedance associated with the lamellar grating for the s - polarization state are shown in figs.3 and fig.4 .",
    "although in the s - polarization state the presence of the grating leads to an increase of the real part of the effective impedance too , even for very deep grooves it can not achieve such giant values that are possible in the p - polarization state .",
    "taking into account that in the case of an arbitrary 1-d surface profile s - polarized waves do not penetrate into deep grooves , we can generalize our result : if an arbitrary 1-d surface profile has rather deep grooves , the effective impedance associated with this surface is a strongly anisotropic tensor .",
    "its element relating to the p - polarized state is much greater than the element relating to the s - polarized state .",

    ". then from eqs.(a.3a ) it follows that up to the terms independent of @xmath239 @xmath309 within the same accuracy from eq.(a.5 ) we have @xmath310 thus , inside the grooves the modal function with @xmath311 gives the main contribution to the magnetic field .",
    "next , the amplitudes of evanescent waves are negligibly small in comparison with the amplitude of the reflected wave . with regard to eq.(a.1 ) and eq.(a.2 ) this means that in the vicinity of the surface the magnetic field is nearly constant : @xmath312 .",
    "in the s - polarization state when calculating the components of the magnetic vector @xmath153 , special attention has to be drawn to the corner points of our lamellar grating .",
