    "compact and flattened circumstellar structures are commonly seen around t  tauri stars at the class  ii stage of evolution for low - mass young stellar objects .",
    "observations in molecular lines reveal that these structures exhibit keplerian motion , and therefore correspond to centrifugally - supported circumstellar disks @xcite .",

    "0 protostars , observations in molecular lines show primarily infalling motion only in their circumstellar disk - like structures @xcite . when rotation also is detected , the rotational velocity is too small for the circumstellar disk - like structures to be centrifugally supported @xcite .",
    "by contrast , an increasing number of studies have been successful at finding keplerian motion in the circumstellar disks of class  i objects @xcite .",
    "the masses of their circumstellar disks span the range @xmath10.0040.06  @xmath5 , and are therefore comparable to the masses of circumstellar disks around class  ii objects . their radii span the range @xmath1100300 au , also comparable to the sizes of circumstellar disks around class  ii objects .",
    "recently , tobin et al . (",
    "2012 ) reported the detection of a keplerian disk around l1527  irs , which they claim to be an object in transition from class 0 to i and therefore the youngest protostar known to exhibit a keplerian circumstellar disk .",
    "the abovementioned results suggest that the transition from primarily infalling disk - like structures to keplerian circumstellar disks around protostars occurs sometime during their evolution from class 0 to class i.    although theoretical models have no problem forming disk - like structures around protostars , in many models these structures are not centrifugally supported and hence do not exhibit keplerian motion ( these disk - like structures are therefore commonly referred to as pseudodisks ) .",
    "naively , if the infalling material from the surrounding dense core conserves angular momentum , eventually the rotational velocity of this material should match the keplerian velocity and hence a centrifugally - supported disk form around the protostar .",
    "in many theoretical models , however , the inclusion of magnetic fields so effectively transports angular momentum outwards through magnetic braking that no centrifugally - supported structures ever form ( e.g. , mellon & li 2008 ; 2009 ; li , krasnopolsky , & shang 2011 ) . from a series of three - dimensional mhd simulations of collapsing bonnor - ebert spheres , machida et al .",

    "the disks produced in their simulations , however , do not become centrifugally - supported over radial sizes of @xmath7100  au until nearly all of the material in their parental dense core has been exhausted , and furthermore have masses of a few to a few hundred times the mass of their central protostars and hence do not exhibit keplerian motion . both the mass and motion of the centrifugally - supported disks produced in the simulations by machida et al .",
    "( 2011a ; 2011b ) do not match those inferred for the keplerian circumstellar disks of class  i protostars .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that machida et al .",
    "( 2011a ; b ) were able to successfully produce centrifugally - supported disks around protostars may provide important insights on how keplerian circumstellar disks form around protostars .",

    "source b must therefore have drove a stronger outflow in the recent past that carved out the observed outflow cavity .",
    "our observation of l1551  ne reported in paper  i was made with the submillimeter array ( sma ) in its extended configuration and in the 0.9-mm continuum as well as @xmath10co  ( 32 ) and c@xmath0o  ( 32 ) lines .",

    "evident in these maps and the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams described below , we hereafter adopt a systemic velocity for l1551  ne of @xmath18 = 6.9 km s@xmath4 . over the blueshifted range ( @xmath18 = 4.26.1",

    "the redshifted emission close to the systemic velocity can be seen to be more strongly weighted towards the east of the protostellar system whereas the blueshifted emission more strongly weighted towards the west .",
    "thus , there appears an east ( red ) to west ( blue ) velocity gradient at low velocities close to the systemic velocity .",
    "figure [ br18 ] shows the combined ( @xmath19 ) and new maps ( @xmath20 ) integrated over the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components ( @xmath21 ) , the low - velocity blueshifted component ( @xmath22 ) , and the low - velocity redshifted component ( @xmath23 ) . in the high - velocity components , the blueshifted and redshifted emission",
    "are well - separated and located to the north and south , respectively , of the protostellar system .",
    "the orientation of these blueshifted and redshifted components and hence the orientation of their velocity gradient match well with the orientation of the major axis of the circumbinary disk , suggesting that the high - velocity components primarily trace the keplerian circumbinary disk as found in paper i. in the low - velocity components , blueshifted emission is seen towards the north of the binary components as in the high - velocity components ; on the other hand , redshifted emission is seen not just to the south but also to the north of the binary components . along the minor axis , the intensity of the low - velocity redshifted emission is weighted towards the east of the protostellar system and that of the low - velocity blueshifted emission weighted towards the west , indicating an east ( red ) to west ( blue ) velocity gradient along the minor axis at velocities close to the systemic velocity as mentioned earlier .",
    "this velocity gradient along the minor axis is clearly seen in the p - v diagram of c@xmath0o ( 32 ) as we describe next .",
    "figure [ pv ] ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) shows the p - v diagrams in c@xmath0o , derived from the combined images , along the major ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) and minor ( @xmath28 @xmath27 ) axes of the circumbinary disk and passing through the position of source a. along the major axis , the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components are individually separated and located to the north and south , respectively , of source a. the emission at higher velocities is concentrated closer to source a than that at lower velocities , a characteristic feature of keplerian disks as illustrated by the blue curves corresponding to the keplerian rotation - curve derived in paper i for the circumbinary disk .",
    "in addition to the features tracing keplerian rotation , around the systemic velocity there also is a spatially - extended redshifted feature toward the north of the source a ( not seen previously in paper  i ) ; this feature arises from the low - velocity redshifted component towards the north of the binary components mentioned above . along the minor axis",
    ", the p - v diagram exhibits a clear velocity gradient at velocities relatively close to the systemic velocity ( again not previously seen in paper  i ) as indicated by the arrows in the lower left panel of figure [ pv ] .",
    "by contrast , no velocity gradient is evident along the minor axis at higher velocities .",
    "the velocity gradient seen at relatively low velocities along the minor axis therefore reflects the motion of the eastern low - velocity redshifted and western low - velocity blueshifted components . for purely keplerian rotation",
    ", no velocity gradient should be evident along the minor axis , and indeed no velocity gradient is seen along the minor axis for the high - velocity components .",
    "the observed velocity gradient along the minor axis for emission at relatively low velocities , seen here for the first time from observations sensitive to larger - scale structures than in paper  i , therefore indicates motion not related to keplerian motion . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the nature of this newly - discovered component .",
    "as described in the previous section , we find that the c@xmath0o ( 32 ) emission surrounding l1551  ne exhibits two distinct velocity components : ( i ) high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components that are more spatially - extended along the north - south than east - west directions , and which show a velocity gradient along the more spatially - extended north - south direction .",
    "these components trace a keplerian circumbinary disk as identified in paper  i ; and ( ii ) low - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components that also are more spatially - extended along the north - south than east - west directions , but which unlike the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components show a velocity gradient along the less spatially - extended east - west direction .",
    "below , we consider two alternative explanations and offer our opinion for the likely nature of the low - velocity components .",
    "one possible interpretation for the low - velocity components is a molecular outflow . from observations with the jcmt , moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the co  ( 3 - 2 ) emission around l1551  ne exhibits blueshifted and redshifted line wings ( at velocities",
    "@xmath72.5 km s@xmath4 from the systemic velocity ) in spectra taken towards the west and east , respectively , of the protostellar system",
    ". they attributed the emission in the line wings to a molecular outflow driven by l1551 ne .",
    "furthermore , near - ir [ fe ii ] observations of l1551 ne show knotty jets driven by source a that are blueshifted to the south - west and and redshifted to the north - east @xcite .",
    "thus , the line wings in co  ( 3 - 2 ) as well as jets driven by source  a share the same sense in velocity gradient in the sky as the low - velocity c@xmath0o ( 32 ) emission reported above .",
    "if the low - velocity blueshifted and redshifted c@xmath0o ( 32 ) components indeed trace a molecular outflow , then based on their projected velocity ( @xmath10.5 km s@xmath4 ; see black arrows in figure [ pv ] ) and projected separation from source a ( @xmath12@xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath1280  au ) , and assuming that the outflow emerges perpendicular to the keplerian circumbinary disk ( inclination of @xmath29 @xmath1 62@xmath9 ; see paper  i ) , the deprojected outflow velocity is then @xmath30 @xmath1 0.5 km s@xmath4 / @xmath31 @xmath1 1.0 km s@xmath4 and the deprojected spatial separation of the individual outflow components @xmath32 @xmath1 280  au / @xmath33 @xmath1 320 au from source a. by comparison , at their separation from the protostellar system , the escape velocity is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational constant and @xmath36 is the mass of the protostellar system (= 0.8 @xmath5 ; paper i ) .",
    "we find @xmath37 @xmath1 2.1 km s@xmath4 , a factor 2 higher than the deprojected outflow velocity mentioned above of @xmath30 @xmath1 1.0 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the low - velocity components are therefore bound to the protostellar system .",
    "indeed , the low - velocity components reach much lower blue- and redshifted velocities ( @xmath38 km s@xmath4 from the systemic velocity ) than the co ( 32 ) outflow observed with the jcmt , even though the jcmt observations probe regions much further away from l1551  ne than that spanned by the low - velocity components . furthermore",
    ", contrary to expectations for a molecular outflow driven along the east - west directions , the low - velocity components are even more spatially - extended along the north - south than east - west directions .",
    "alternatively , we consider the possibility that the low - velocity components correspond to gas co - planar with but lying just beyond the keplerian radius of the circumbinary disk .",
    "as described in @xmath113 , the major axis of the circumbinary disk is orthogonal to the projected axes of the [ fe ii ] jets from source a ; if indeed the plane of the circumbinary disk is perpendicular to the axis of the jets , the western part of the disk plane would then correspond to the far side and the eastern part of the disk plane to the near side .",
    "correspondingly , the western low - velocity blueshifted component would then be located on the far side and the eastern low - velocity redshifted component the near side .",
    "the low - velocity components would therefore be infalling towards the circumbinary disk along the disk plane .",
    "the infall velocity , @xmath39 , can be roughly estimated from the velocity gradient seen for the low - velocity components along the minor axis of the circumbinary disk in the p - v diagram of figure [ pv ] . at the opposing locations of the low - velocity components ,",
    "the velocity shift across the minor axis is @xmath11.0 km s@xmath4 ( see arrows in figure [ pv ] ) . at an inclination of @xmath29 @xmath1 62@xmath9 for the circumbinary disk ,",
    "the infall velocity along the disk plane is therefore @xmath39 @xmath1 ( 1.0 km s@xmath4/2 ) / sin 62@xmath9 @xmath1 0.6 km s@xmath4 .    to see if the above interpretation offers a good fit to the observed p - v diagrams , we have generated p - v diagrams based on a simple toy model to compare with the observed p - v diagrams .",
    "our model comprises a geometrically - thin disk as was adopted to model the keplerian circumbinary disk described in paper  i , but with a velocity field now described by :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the radius along the disk , @xmath29 is the disk inclination , @xmath42 the rotational velocity of the disk ( i.e. , the portion corresponding to the keplerian circumbinary disk ) , @xmath43 the radial ( infall ) velocity of the disk ( i.e. , the portion corresponding to the low - velocity components ) , @xmath44 the keplerian radius , and @xmath39 an adopted constant infall velocity beyond the keplerian radius . like in paper  i",
    ", we adopt @xmath36 = 0.8 @xmath5 , @xmath29 = 62@xmath9 , a disk position angle of @xmath45 = 167@xmath9 with the dynamical center at source a , and an internal velocity dispersion @xmath46 = 0.4 km s@xmath4 . to model the intensity distribution of the disk ,",
    "we adopt an intensity profile that resembles the intensity distribution of the c@xmath0o emission as derived from the moment 0 map ( the c@xmath0o emission shows no evidence for candidate circumstellar disks associated with the two binary components as seen in the continuum at 0.9  mm and reported in paper  i ; we therefore believe that the observed c@xmath0o is dominated by emission from the circumbinary disk . ) .",
    "that is , we fitted two - dimensional gaussian structures to the observed moment 0 map of figure  [ mom0 ] to represent the intensity distribution of the disk ; we found that a minimum of three gaussian components were required to produce a satisfactory fit , comprising two relatively compact gaussians each centered on the two peaks seen in the moment 0 map , along with a much broader gaussian to capture more extended emission surrounding the two peaks . by varying the keplerian radius ( @xmath44 ) and the infall velocity beyond the keplerian radius ( @xmath39 )",
    ", we found from trial and error a model p - v diagram that we judged ( by eye ) to provide a satisfactory fit to the observed p - v diagrams . to generate the model p - v diagrams , first each trial velocity field for the disk",
    "was converted into the line - of - sight velocity on the disk plane , and then model velocity - channel maps created from the line - of - sight velocity map , the model moment 0 map , and the assumed internal velocity dispersion ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the model p - v diagrams were then generated from the model velocity - channel maps .",
    "the model described above ignores a potential envelope component ( corresponding to the parental dense core of l1551  ne ) in which the the disk component is embedded , and which if not completely recovered in our sma observations introduces artifacts in the maps constructed from the available data and also the velocity field derived from these maps ( e.g. , p - v diagrams ) . to simulate the effect such an envelope would have on our model p - v diagrams",
    ", we have added an envelope component to the disk component described above so that our final model comprises a disk embedded in a spherically - symmetric envelope . using the @xmath47-coverage attained in our sma observations",
    ", we made mock observations of the model velocity - channel maps having different @xmath44 and @xmath39 for the disk component as described above and the parameters for the envelope component as described below to generate model visibilities , and then fourier - transformed and cleaned the model visibilities to produce simulated - observed model velocity - channel maps .",
    "the latter maps are then used to derive simulated - observed model p - v diagrams .",
    "we decided upon the parameters of the model envelope component in the following manner .",
    "a c@xmath0o ( 32 ) spectrum taken with the cso towards the center of l1551  ne exhibits two distinct components : one centered at @xmath48@xmath16.7 km s@xmath4 that has a narrower velocity width of @xmath10.68 km s@xmath4 , and the other centered at @xmath48@xmath17.0 km s@xmath4 that has a broader velocity width of @xmath12.2 km s@xmath4 @xcite . the central velocity and velocity range spanned by the broader component are similar to those of the c@xmath0o ( 32 ) emission that we mapped with the sma . indeed ,",
    "a comparison of the sma c@xmath0o ( 32 ) spectrum with the cso c@xmath0o ( 32 ) spectrum shows that virtually all of the flux in the cso spectrum is recovered in our sma observation in the ( @xmath48 ) velocity range @xmath13.95.4 km s@xmath4 and @xmath18.79.4 km s@xmath4 ( although the poor s / n of the cso spectrum in the line wings prevents us from precisely estimating the amount of the recovered flux ) .",
    "by contrast , around the systemic velocity , we miss in our sma observations a significant amount of flux present in the cso spectrum . in the lower blueshifted - velocity range",
    "6.46.8 km s@xmath4 , the amount of the recovered flux is only 78@xmath15 of the cso flux , whereas in the lower redshifted - velocity range 7.27.5 km s@xmath4 , the amount of recovered flux is 3040@xmath15 .",
    "much the missing flux corresponds to the narrower component in the cso spectrum described above ; this component must therefore correspond to a spatially - extended envelope .",
    "unfortunately , there are no available single - dish maps of the c@xmath0o ( 32 ) emission around l1551 ne and so the structure and the kinematics of this envelope are unclear .",
    "observations of l1551 ne in the 850 @xmath49 dust continuum emission with scuba on the jcmt show that the size of the surrounding dusty envelope is @xmath19@xmath508@xmath178@xmath508 @xcite .",

    "the model that invokes only keplerian rotation in the disk ( keplerian only model ) shows that the blueshifted and redshifted components lie at distinct opposite quadrants in the p - v plane , such that emission at higher velocities is located closer to the center than that at lower velocities ; these characteristics are similar to those seen in the p - v diagrams for the observed high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components . this model , however , can not reproduce the observed spatially - extended low - velocity component to the north of source a in the p - v diagram along the major axis .",
    "furthermore , in the p - v diagram along the minor axis , the model incorporating only a keplerian disk does not reproduce the observed velocity gradient at velocities relatively close to the systemic velocity .",

    "provides an excellent fit to the gross spatial - kinematic morphology of the observed c@xmath0o emission as captured in the p - v diagrams ( irrespective of whether of not the disk is embedded in a spatially - extended envelope ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the low - velocity components newly detected here in observations sensitive to larger - scale structures than those in paper  i most likely trace infalling gas located just beyond the keplerian circumbinary disk first detected in paper  i. we note that the model ( constant ) infall velocity beyond the keplerian radius of @xmath39 @xmath10.6 km s@xmath4 ( arrows in figure  [ pv ] ) is smaller than the expected free - fall velocity ( red curves in figure  [ pv ] ) onto a central stellar mass ( for both binary components combined ) of @xmath36 = 0.8 @xmath5 over the radial range from the protostellar system ( source a ) plotted in figure [ pv ] ; e.g. , at a radius of @xmath1300  au ( the keplerian radius ) , the predicted free - fall velocity is @xmath12.2 km s@xmath4 .",
    "instead , the model infall velocity of @xmath10.6 km s@xmath4 at @xmath41=300 au implies a central stellar mass of only @xmath10.06 @xmath5 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the formal value for the mass of the protostellar system estimated from the keplerian motion of the circumbinary disk of 0.8@xmath53 @xmath5 ( uncertainty corresponding to the fwhm of the @xmath54-squared curve ; see paper i ) .",
    "the smaller - than - expected infall velocity may indicate that the infalling material is decelerated ( presumably by gas pressure , if not also turbulence ) as it reaches close to the keplerian disk . on the other hand , we emphasize that , in our toy model , we did not include any rotation in the infalling region . we have attempted a number of models that connect the rotational profile of the keplerian disk at @xmath44 to the outer infalling region using a @xmath55 rotational profile , but such velocity profiles can not reproduce the low - velocity redshifted component to the north apparent in the observed p - v diagram along the major axis .",
    "this failure to connect the keplerian to the infalling region using a sensible rotational profile may indicate an abrupt increase in the rotational velocity progressing inwards from the infalling region to @xmath44 .",
    "although theoretical models have so far only investigated the possible formation of keplerian circumstellar disks around single protostars , we anticipate the same models to reach their same conclusions on the formation of keplerian circumbinary disks around the closely - separated components of a binary protostellar system like l1551  ne .",
    "indeed , the mass ( @xmath10.030.12 @xmath5 ; paper  i ) and size ( outer radius @xmath1300  au ) of the keplerian circumbinary disk around l1551  ne , a class  i object , is comparable to the masses and sizes of circumstellar disks observed around single class  i protostars .    as mentioned in section  1 , despite the ever increasing evidence for keplerian circumstellar disks around class i protostars ,",
    "many theoretical models continue to have difficulty forming such disks around protostars .",
    "mellon & li ( 2009 ) and li , krasnopolsky , & shang ( 2011 ) have conducted thorough 2-d axisymmetric simulations of the collapse of rotating and magnetized singular isothermal cores , in which they included non - ideal mhd effects such as ambipolar diffusion , the hall effect , and ohmic dissipation .",
    "their detailed investigations show that even in the case of moderately magnetized cases ( mass - to - flux ratio @xmath56 @xmath210 ) , magnetic braking is strong enough to remove essentially all of the angular momentum of the material that accretes onto the central object and thus suppress the formation of any sizable ( @xmath7 several au ) centrifugally - supported disks .",
    "they argued that effects not included in their models such as outflow stripping of protostellar envelopes that anchor the magnetic field and/or enhanced magnetic diffusivity due to the turbulent - induced reconnection may be required to form keplerian disks with radii @xmath7 100  au .",
    "machida et al . ( 2011a ; b ) have performed 3-d magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of bonnor - ebert spheres with different initial rotations and magnetic fields . under a broad range of conditions",
    ", they were able to successfully form centrifugally - supported disks with radii @xmath7100 au , although not until near or at the end of the main accretion phase . because the mass of the circumstellar disk in their model is considerably larger ( by a factor of @xmath12100 ) than that of the central protostar ( see also vorobyov 2009 ) , however , the circumstellar disk does not exhibit keplerian motion and is subject to fragmentation .",
    "as mentioned above , li , krasnopolsky , & shang ( 2011 ) argued that the simulations performed by machida et al .",
    "( 2011a ; b ) are severely affected by numerical diffusivity of the magnetic fields .    in the case of l1551",
    "ne , our toy model that adequately reproduces the observed p - v diagrams comprises a circumbinary disk having motions dominated by keplerian rotation inside a radius of @xmath1300  au ( the keplerian radius ) and infall ( with an infall velocity considerably smaller than the free - fall velocity ) outside this radius .",
    "such a break between predominantly rotational and predominantly infalling motions can be seen in the theoretical simulations by machida et al .",
    "( 2011a ; 2011b ) , although as mentioned above these simulations produce much more massive centrifugally - supported circumstellar disks ( which moreover do not exhibit keplerian motion ) than are actually observed .",
    "the abrupt decrease in rotational velocity between the inner and outer regions of this disk indicates that angular momentum is effectively transported outwards , presumably by magnetic braking as invoked in theoretical models , beyond the keplerian radius . within the keplerian radius",
    ", we can not easily quantify any deviation in the measured velocity field from keplerian motion , although some loss of angular momentum is required for material to move through the circumbinary disk and eventually accrete onto the protostellar system .",
    "to explain the difference in the effectiveness at which angular momentum is transported outwards within and beyond the keplerian radius in the circumbinary disk , we borrow ideas from machida et al .",
    "( 2011a ; 2011b ) as well as add our own .",
    "one reason may be the difference in the plasma @xmath6 between the inner and outer regions of the disk , which is defined as , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the magnetic flux density and the thermal pressure , respectively @xcite . strictly speaking , plasma @xmath6 applies only to highly - ionized gas . in the present situation of weakly - ionized and primarily molecular gas , the magnetic field",
    "is well coupled to the molecular gas through free electrons and ions , at least in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field . under such circumstances",
    ", the gas pressure refers not only to the ionized component , but also the neutral component ; i.e. , the total gas pressure , which in the present situation is dominated by the pressure of the molecular gas . to",
    "that we add the likelihood that the ionization fraction decreases dramatically between the outer and inner regions of the disk . at smaller",
    "radii , the thermal pressure is likely to be higher because of the higher gas density and temperature ; consistent with this idea , the inferred infall velocity is smaller than the expected free - fall velocity near the keplerian radius , presumably because the infalling material is decelerated as it moves into regions of higher gas pressure .",
    "in addition , ohmic dissipation of magnetic fields becomes increasingly more effective in denser regions closer to the protostar where cosmic rays do not penetrate as easily to ionize the molecular gas ( machida et al .",
    "2011a ; 2011b ) , and to which we add also because free electrons become increasingly depleted by adsorption onto dust grains in denser gas .",
    "as a consequence , the plasma @xmath6 can increase and the ionization fraction decrease significantly towards smaller radii , and hence the control exerted by magnetic fields on the molecular gas become dramatically weaker at smaller radii . in this scenario , magnetic braking becomes ineffective within a certain ( the keplerian ) radius , outside of which magnetic braking can operate effectively ; this scenario nonetheless requires the initial infalling matter that forms the keplerian disk to have retained appreciable angular momentum .",
    "the transition between good and poor magnetic control of the molecular gas may occur quite abruptly not only at a certain radius , but also at a particular stage in the evolution of a protostellar system as the mass and hence density of the circumbinary disk grows . in our toy model ,",
    "the transition between predominantly infalling to predominantly keplerian motion in the circumbinary disk is infinitely sharp , a situation which is of course not physical ; rather , our toy model suggests that this transition must occur over an annular region that is too narrow to be probed at the angular resolution of our observations .",
    "finally , we consider the possible future evolution of the keplerian circumbinary disk in l1551  ne as it continues to accumulate mass from infalling material . on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , an excitation temperature of c@xmath0o ( 32 ) of 42  k @xcite , and a c@xmath0o abundance of 1.7 @xmath17 10@xmath60 @xcite , we estimate a mass for the infalling component detected in our observations of @xmath10.0023 @xmath5 . for an infall velocity derived in our model of 0.6 km s@xmath4 at a radius of 300 au ,",
    "the mass - infall rate is therefore ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath19.6 @xmath17 10@xmath60 @xmath5 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this value is , incidentally , comparable to the estimated mass - infall rate onto the keplerian circumstellar disk of l1527 irs of @xmath16.6 @xmath17 10@xmath60 @xmath5 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the envelope around l1551  ne has a mass ( in both molecular gas and dust ) of @xmath10.39 @xmath5 as inferred from its dust continuum emission at 0.85  mm observed with the jcmt @xcite .",
    "if this entire envelope drains onto the keplerian circumbinary disk at the abovementioned mass - infall rate , the latter can continue to accumulate mass for the next @xmath10.39 @xmath5 / 9.6 @xmath17 10@xmath60 @xmath5 yr@xmath4 @xmath1 4.1 @xmath17 10@xmath61 yr .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the typical timescale estimated for the class i evolutionary stage ( @xmath12.5  6.7 @xmath17 10@xmath61 yr ; hatchell et al . 2007 ) .",
    "thus , the keplerian circumbinary disk of l1551  ne may continue to grow in mass until the end of the main accretion phase . because the total mass of the keplerian circumbinary disk would then become comparable to the present mass of the protostellar system , however",
    ", this disk may become unstable to fragmentation if all the mass that falls onto the keplerian circumbinary disk remains there .",
    "of course , rather than growing too much in mass and fragmenting , much of the material in the keplerian circumbinary disk may accrete onto the protostellar components and/or be ejected or entrained in an outflow .",
    "we have conducted follow - up observations of the binary protostellar system l1551 ne in c@xmath0o ( 32 ) with the sma in its subcompact and compact configurations .",
    "we presented results made from the new data alone , as well those from combining the new data with that taken previously with the sma in its extended configuration ( paper  i ) .",
    "together , the combined data cover spatial scales spanning the range @xmath11402000 au . from the resulting maps and p - v diagrams",
    ", we found :    \\1 .",
    "an elongated feature around the binary protostellar system with an outer dimension of @xmath11000 au @xmath17 800 au as shown in figure [ mom0 ] .",
    "the dimensions of this feature are significantly larger than those of the keplerian circumbinary disk reported in paper i of @xmath1600 au @xmath17 300 au imaged only with the extended configuration of the sma . the major axis of this feature matches well with the major axis of the keplerian circumbinary disk , and is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a as well as the major axis of an outflow cavity centered on source b. this feature therefore traces a circumbinary disk or disk - like structure whose major axis , and presumably also equatorial plane , is perpendicular to outflows from the binary protostellar components",
    "the velocity field of the circumbinary disk - like structure can be decomposed into two distinct components as seen in the velocity - channel maps of figures  [ ch18][br18 ] and most clearly in the corresponding p - v diagrams of figure  [ pv ] .",
    "one component comprises high - velocity ( @xmath620.5 km s@xmath4 ) blueshifted and redshifted emissions located towards the north and south , respectively , of the binary protostellar system , as seen in paper  i. the other component comprises low - velocity ( @xmath630.5 km s@xmath4 ) blueshifted and redshifted emissions located towards the west and the east , respectively , of the binary protostellar system , seen here for the first time .",
    "the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components are distinctly separated in space and aligned along the major axis of the circumbinary disk .",
    "their velocity field is consistent with keplerian motion , and so these components are associated with the keplerian circumbinary disk identified in paper  i. * conversely * , the low - velocity components shows weak redshifted emission to the north in addition to strong redshifted emission to the south ( the latter just like the high - velocity redshifted component ) of the binary protostellar system , as well as an east ( red ) to west ( blue ) velocity gradient along the minor axis of the circumbinary disk .",
    "+ we made a toy model comprising a circumbinary disk - like structure that exhibits pure keplerian motion ( for a binary protostellar mass of 0.8 @xmath5 , as derived in paper  i ) in its inner region and pure infalling motion at a constant velocity in its outer region , and which is surrounded by a diffuse envelope . from this toy model",
    ", we generated model maps for different keplerian radii and infall velocities .",
    "we then made mock observations of these model maps with the same @xmath47-coverage as that attained in our observations with the sma to generate simulated - observed model maps , and from the latter derived simulated - observed model p - v diagrams to compare with the observed p - v diagrams .",
    "we found that :    \\3 .",
    "the inclusion or exclusion of a diffuse envelope , the parameters for which we could only roughly estimate , do not change in an important manner the simulated - observed model p - v diagrams .",
    "the best - fit toy model requires motion in the disk to change from ( pure ) keplerian to ( pure ) infall at a radius of @xmath1300  au , the keplerian radius .",
    "the low - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components mentioned above trace primarily the outer infalling portion of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the best - fit infall velocity is 0.6 km s@xmath4 , which is smaller than the expected free - fall velocity of @xmath12.2 km s@xmath4 at the keplerian radius .",
    "we tried , but were unable , to connect the motions within and beyond the keplerian radius with a power - law rotational profile in a manner compatible with the observed p - v diagrams , suggesting that the transition between infall and rotation occurs over a region much narrower than can be studied in our observations .",
    "+ we considered the implications of our results for the formation of keplerian circumbinary disks around protostellar systems :    \\4 .",
    "the lack of detectable rotation in the infalling component implies that angular momentum is effectively transported outwards in the outer region ( i.e. , beyond the keplerian radius ) of the circumbinary disk .",
    "on the other hand , angular momentum is not effectively transported outwards in the inner region ( i.e. , within the keplerian radius ) of the same disk .",
    "borrowing in part ideas from machida et al .",
    "( 2011a ; 2011b ) but also adding our own , we suggest that this difference in effectiveness at which angular momentum is transported outwards may be caused by the very different plasma @xmath6 , the ratio of the gas to magnetic pressure , along with the different ionization fractions of the molecular gas in these two regions . beyond the keplerian radius ,",
    "the plasma @xmath6 is relatively small and the ionization fraction relatively high so that magnetic fields have effective control of the molecular gas , allowing angular momentum to be efficiently transported outwards through magnetic breaking . within the keplerian radius ,",
    "the plasma @xmath6 increases whereas the ionization fraction decreases , so that magnetic fields no longer have effective control of the molecular gas and hence magnetic braking becomes ineffective .",
    "consistent with the idea of strong gas pressure near the keplerian radius , the inferred infall velocity is smaller than the expected free - fall velocity near the keplerian radius , presumably because the infalling material is decelerated as it moves into regions of higher gas pressure .",
    "the transition between good and poor magnetic control of the molecular gas may occur quite abruptly not only at a certain radius , but also at a particular stage in the evolution of a protostellar system as the mass and hence density of the circumbinary disk grows .",
    "the inferred mass - accretion rate onto the keplerian circumbinary disk is @xmath19.6 @xmath17 10@xmath60 @xmath5 yr@xmath4 .",
    "given that the mass in the surrounding dense condensation is @xmath10.39 @xmath5 , there is sufficient material to feed the keplerian circumbinary disk at the abovementioned mass - accretion rate for the next @xmath14.1 @xmath17 10@xmath61 yr , which is comparable to the typical timescale estimated for the class i evolutionary stage .",
    "a large fraction of this material , however , must either accumulate onto the central protostellar system and/or be ejected or entrained in an outflow for the circumbinary disk to remain stable throughout its subsequent evolution .",
    "+ we close by offering a few thoughts on what future work ought to be conducted to better inform models to reproduce the keplerian circumbinary disk of l1551  ne as well as test the ideas proposed above for the differences in effectiveness at which angular momentum is transported outwards within and beyond the keplerian radius in the disk .",
    "our observations with the sma indicate that the transition from predominantly infalling to predominantly keplerian motion occurs within an annular strip having an angular width of @xmath12@xmath16 where the observed radial velocity changes by @xmath10.5 km s@xmath4 ( figure [ pv ] ) .",
    "observations with alma should be able to easily probe the kinematics of this transition region , and reveal how the infall and rotational velocities change with radius so as to compare with theoretical models ( e.g. , such as those by machida et al .",
    "2011a ; 2011b ) .",
    "single - dish mapping of l1551 ne in c@xmath0o ( 32 ) , combined with our sma data , will permit studies of infall and rotation , and hence the transport of angular momentum , from the outer region of the envelope ( at @xmath71500 au ) to the keplerian circumbinary disk .",
    "observation of ionic molecules such as hco@xmath64 and n@xmath65h@xmath64 at high angular resolutions can be used to look for differences in ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between the keplerian circumbinary disk and the surrounding infalling regions , and hence test our idea that differences in ionization fractions play an important role in how effectively magnetic fields can exert control over molecular gas in the different regions .",
