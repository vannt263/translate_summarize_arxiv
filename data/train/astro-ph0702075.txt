    "most of this energy breaks out of the magnetosphere in a fireball of plasma expanding at relativistic speeds which produces the initial spike of giant flares .",
    "the oscillating tail that follows this spike , displaying many tens of cycles at the neutron star spin , is interpreted as due to a  trapped fireball \" , which remains anchored inside the magnetosphere ( the total energy released in this tail is @xmath16  erg in all three events detected so far , comparable to the energy of a @xmath17 g trapping magnetospheric field ) .",

    "this is more than two decades higher than the energy of the other giant flares observed so far , the 1979 march 5 event from sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite and the 1998 august 27 event from sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite .",
    "only one such powerful flare has been recorded in about 30 yr of monitoring of the @xmath20 known magnetars in sgrs .",
    "the recurrence time in a single magnetar implied by this event is thus about @xmath21  yr . the realisation that powerful giant flares could be observed from distances of tens of mpc ( and thus might represent a sizeable fraction of the short gamma ray burst population ) motivated searches for 2004 dec 27-like events in the batse grb database @xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the recurrence time of powerful giant flares obtained in these studies range from @xmath22 to 600  yr per galaxy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 to 20 times longer than inferred above .",

    "find that the location of 10 - 25% of the short grbs in the batse catalogue correlates with the position of galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath24  mpc ) , suggesting that a fraction of the short grbs may originate from a population of powerful giant flare - like events .",
    "a 2004 dec 27-like event in the galaxy could not be missed , whereas several systematic effects can reduce the chances of detection from large distances ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) . rather than regarding the 2004 dec 27 event as statistically unlikely",
    ", one can thus evaluate the chances of a recurrence time of hundreds of years , _ given _ the occurrence of the 2004 dec 27 hyperflare .",
    "we estimate that , having observed a powerful giant flare in our galaxy in @xmath25  yr of observations , the bayesian probability that the galactic recurrence time is @xmath26  yr is @xmath27 , whereas the @xmath28 confidence upper limit is @xmath29  yr .",
    "we thus favor smaller values and assume in the following @xmath30  yr .    in @xmath31  yr ( that we adopt for the sgr lifetime ) ,",
    "about 70 very powerful giant flares should be emitted by an sgr , releasing a total energy of @xmath32  erg .",
    "we note that if the giant flares emission were beamed in a fraction @xmath33 of the sky ( and thus the energy released in individual flares a factor of @xmath33 lower ) , the recurrence time would be a factor of @xmath33 shorter .",
    "therefore the total release of energy would remain the same .",
    "if this energy originates from the magnetar s internal magnetic field , this must be @xmath34  g @xcite .",
    "this value should be regarded as a _",
    "lower limit_. firstly , the magnetar model predicts a conspicuous neutrino luminosity from ambipolar diffusion - driven field decay , an energy component that is not available to flares . including this",
    ", we estimate that the limit above increases by @xmath35 60% and becomes @xmath36 g. secondly , ambipolar diffusion and magnetic dissipation should take place at a faster rate for higher values of the field @xcite .",
    "therefore estimates of the internal b - field based on present day properties of sgrs likely underestimate the value of their initial magnetic field .",
    "very strong toroidal b fields are expected to be generated inside a differentially rotating fast spinning neutron star , subject to vigorous neutrino - driven convection instants after its formation @xcite .",
    "a field of several @xmath37 g can be generated in magnetars that are born with spin periods of a few milliseconds @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , values up to @xmath38  g can not be ruled out .    in the following",
    "we explore the consequences of these fields for the generation of gravitational waves from newborn magnetars .",
    "we parametrize their ( internal ) toroidal field with @xmath39  g , ( external ) dipole field with @xmath40  g and initial spin period with @xmath41 .",
    "the possibility that fast - rotating , magnetically - distorted neutron stars are conspicuous sources of gravitational radiation has been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "more recently , work has been carried out in the context of the magnetar model , for internal magnetic fields strengths of @xmath42  g @xcite . in the following",
    "we show that for the range of magnetic fields discussed in section 2 , newly born , millisecond spinning magnetars are conspicuous sources of gravitational radiation that will be detectable up to virgo cluster distances @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic pressure from the toroidal b - field deforms a magnetar into a prolate shape , with ellipticity @xmath43 , where the brackets indicate a volume - average over the entire core @xcite .",
    "as long as the axis of the magnetic distortion is not aligned with the spin axis , the star s rotation will cause a periodic variation of the mass quadrupole moment , in turn resulting in the emission of gravitational waves , gws , at twice the spin frequency of the star . + free precession of the ellipsoidal ns is also excited and , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , its viscous damping drives the symmetry axis of the magnetic distortion orthogonal to the spins axis , if the ellipsoid is prolate , _",
    "i.e. _ if the magnetic field is toroidal . therefore , viscous damping of free precession in newly born magnetars leads to a geometry that maximizes the time - varying mass quadrupole moment , and gw emission accordingly .",
    "however , the power emitted in gws scales as @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the gw signal , for a given toroidal b - field , depends critically on the initial value and early evolution of the spin period .",
    "the spin evolution of a newborn magnetar is determined by angular momentum losses from gws , electromagnetic dipole radiation and relativistic winds . according to @xcite ,",
    "the latter mechanism is negligible except for external dipole fields @xmath45  g and we will neglect it here .",
    "the spin evolution of a newborn magnetar under the combined effects of gw and electromagnetic dipole radiation is given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the angular velocity , + @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the neutron star radius , @xmath51 the gravitational constant and @xmath52 the speed of light .",
    "this gives a spin - down timescale of @xmath53 the condition for the newly formed magnetar to become an orthogonal rotator before loosing a significant fraction of its initial spin energy is @xcite : @xmath54 if condition ( [ condition ] ) is met , the magnetar quickly becomes a maximally efficient gw emitter , while its spin period is still close to the initial one . in this case",
    ", the instantaneous signal strain can be expressed as : @xmath55 where the distance @xmath56 is in units of the virgo cluster distance and the angle - averaged strain is that given by @xcite .",
    "we estimate the characteristic amplitude , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of cycles over which the signal is observed . using equation ( [ strain ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath59 under the conditions discussed above , strong gw losses are not quenched immediately after the magnetar birth but rather extend in time , typically from days to a few weeks , before fading away as a result of the star spin - down .",

    "matched - filtering represents the optimal detection strategy for long - lived , periodic signals , also in those cases where their frequency is slowly evolving over time .",
    "this process involves the correlation of the data stream with a discrete set of template signals that probe the relevant space of unknown parameters : the sky position ( 2 _ extrinsic _ parameters ) and the 2 _ intrinsic _ parameters that control the evolution of the gw phase ( see eq.([general ] ) ) .",
    "template spacing in the parameter space is chosen appropriately , so as to reduce to a value less than , say , 10% ( depending on the sensitivity one wants to achieve ) the fraction of the intrinsic signal - to - noise ratio that is lost in the cross - correlation .",
    "dallosso & re ( 2006 ) have recently investigated in detail a matched - filtering ( coherent ) search strategy for the expected signal from newly formed magnetars in the virgo cluster .",
    "given the two ( uncorrelated ) parameters involved in the signal frequency evolution , this approach implies an unaffordable computational cost .",
    "a huge number of templates @xmath67 would be required to cover the relevant parameter space ( the plane @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 ) with a sufficiently fine grid that the intrinsic signal - to - noise ratio would not be too degraded .",
    "although this calculation is rather idealized , the resulting number of templates is so large that no realistic calculation could decrease it by the several orders of magnitude needed to make the search feasible .",
    "the search for this new class of signals represents however a challenge that must be investigated in greater depth . we are currently studying a hierarchical approach to the problem , a process where coherent and incoherent stages of the search are alternated as to reduce the computational requirements by a large factor , at the price of a relativeley modest loss in sensitivity to the signal .",
    "a ns spinning at @xmath35 ms period has a spin energy @xmath70 erg and the spindown timescale through magnetic dipole radiation and/or relativistic particle winds is extremely short , from a few weeks to @xmath35 one day for dipole fields in the ( @xmath71 g range . in standard magnetar scenarios ,",
    "most of the initial spin energy is expected to be rapidly transferred to the surrounding supernova ejecta through these spindown mechanisms @xcite .",
    "therefore , present - day snrs around known magnetar candidates should bear the signature of such a large energy injection . for initial spin periods less than 3 ms ,",
    "the injected energy would be @xmath72 erg , making these remnants significantly more energetic than those surrounding ordinary nss ( @xmath73 erg s@xmath6 ) . + the x - ray spectra of the snrs surrounding known magnetar candidates ( two apxs and two sgrs ) studied by vink et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , do not show any evidence that their total energy content differs from that in remnants surrounding common nss ( @xmath74 erg ) : this result constrains magnetar parameters at birth . @xcite",
    "deduced from their measurements an initial spin @xmath75 ms for the above mentioned sources , assuming that all the spin - down energy is emitted through electromagnetic radiation and/or particle winds , and thus absorbed by the surrounding ejecta in the early days of spindown .",
    "their limit period is long enough to rise a serious question as to the viability of the @xmath3 dynamo scenario for generating the large - scale magnetic fields of magnetars .",
    "models that do not rely upon very short spin periods at birth , such as the flux - freezing scenario suggested by @xcite , would be favored by these results .",
    "+ however , given the possibility that newly formed magnetars be strong gw emitters in their early days , we show that the results by @xcite can be accounted for within this framework .",
    "most of a magnetar s initial spin energy could indeed be released through gws , without being absorbed by the expanding remnant shell .",
    "therefore , the results of x - ray studies can be used within our model to constrain the initial combination of @xmath76 .",
    "the general expression for the total energy emitted via gws is given by : @xmath77        we insert eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) and the expression for the gw luminosity of an elliptically distorted , spinning object into eq .",

    "a third one derives from the fact that the remaining fraction ( @xmath86 ) of the initial spin energy is available for being transferred to the ejecta through magnetodipole radiation . by assuming that all this energy is effectively transferred to the snr",
    ", we get : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the spin - down energy injected in the expanding shell , constrained by the results of @xcite to be @xmath89 erg .",
    "we use the results of @xcite , according to which a 1.4 m@xmath90 ns has a radius @xmath91 km and a moment of inertia @xmath92 g @xmath93 . note that , by these numbers , one obtains the following relation between the measured @xmath94 and @xmath95 of nss and the corresponding value of the dipolar magnetic field at the magnetic pole ( our @xmath68 ) g @xmath93 and @xmath96 km .",
    "use of the most up to date parameters is required , given the strong dependence of the two competing torques on the exact value of the magnetic fields . ] : @xmath97 as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ gwsall ] ) , dipole magnetic fields stronger than @xmath98 g rapidly quench the expected s / n ratio of gw signals from newly formed magnetars .",
    "therefore , we restrict our investigation to polar dipole fields @xmath99 . from eq .",
    "( [ secondrelation ] ) we see that , once @xmath100 is given , both @xmath81 and @xmath101 are determined ( one can indeed use any of the three as the free parameter ) . the first expression of eq .",
    "( [ defx ] ) thus provides a relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "+ we have repeated this procedure for five values of the ratio of the gw over the magnetodipole torque ( @xmath100 ) and , for each of them , obtained the implied values of @xmath101 and @xmath81 and a curve @xmath69 vs. @xmath68 .",
    "[ bplane ] summarizes our results .",
    "loci in the @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 plane for which fast spinning , ultramagnetized magnetars are consistent with the energetic constraints derived by @xcite are drawn for the five chosen values of @xmath100 or , equivalently , the initial spin period ( since @xmath102 is fixed ) .",
    "details are given in the caption .",
    "+ in summary , we have first identified a range of initial conditions ( spin period , internal and external magnetic field ) , within which newly formed magnetars can be interesting targets for next generation gw detectors .",
    "then we have calculated that , within most of that same region , magnetars should emit less than @xmath103 ergs through magnetodipole radiation ( cfr . @xcite and fig .",
    "[ bplane ] ) .",
    "this is compatible with the limits inferred through recent x - ray observations of snrs around present - day magnetar candidates .",
    "the energy liberated in the 2004 december 27 flare from sgr  1806 - 20 , together with the likely recurrence rate of these events , points to a magnetar internal field strength of @xmath104  g or greater .",
    "such a field likely results from differential rotation in a millisecond spinning proto - magnetar and deforms the star into a prolate shape .",
    "magnetars with these characteristics are expected to be very powerful sources of gravitational radiation in the first days to weeks of their life .",
    "an evolving periodic gw signal at @xmath105  khz , whose frequency halves over weeks , would unambiguously reveal the early days of a fast spinning magnetar .",
    "prospects for revealing their gw signal depend on the birth rate of these objects .",
    "the three associations between an axp and a supernova remnant ( ages in the @xmath106  yr range ) implies a magnetar birth rate of @xmath107  yr@xmath6 in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore the chances of witnessing the formation of a magnetar in our galaxy are slim .",
    "a rich cluster like virgo , containing @xmath108 galaxies , is expected to give birth to magnetars at a rate of @xmath109 1 yr@xmath6 .",
    "a fraction of these might have sufficiently high toroidal fields that a detectable gw is produced . + it has been recently found that snr shells around some magnetar candidates have comparable expansion energies to standard snr shells .",
    "this implies that either the ns was not initially spinning as fast as required for an @xmath3 dynamo to amplify its field to magnetar strengths , or that most of its initial spin energy was emitted in a way that did not interact with the ejecta .",
    "gws have indeed such property . if the internal magnetic field of newly formed magnetars is @xmath110 g , comparable to the lower limit estimated through the enegetics of the dec 27 giant flare , then their gw emission can be strong enough to radiate away most of their initial spin energy .",
    "the required amount of energy emitted through gws is indeed such that , had these magnetar candidates been at the distance of the virgo cluster , they would have been revealed by a ligo ii - class gw detector .    therefore , gws from newly formed magnetars can account naturally for the recent x - ray observations of snrs around galactic magnetars .",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn at present is that newborn , fast spinning magnetars represent a potential class of gw emitters over virgo scale distances that might well be within reach for the forthcoming generation of gw detectors .    3 abbott , b .",
