    "it is well known that during last three decades a lot of attention is paid to the investigation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theories ( qft ) under influence of different external conditions . in particular ,",
    "the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gross - neveu ( gn ) @xcite type models are among the most popular @xcite .",
    "there are several basic motivations for this interest .",
    "since low dimensional theories have a rather simple structure , they can be used in order to develop our physical intuition for different physical phenomena taking place in real ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world ( such as dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite , color superconductivity @xcite etc ) .",
    "another example of this kind is the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking induced by external magnetic fields , i.e. the magnetic catalysis effect ( see the recent reviews @xcite and references therein ) . for the first time",
    "this effect was also studied in terms of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn models @xcite .",
    "in addition , low dimensional models are useful in elaborating new qft methods like the large-@xmath3 technique @xcite and the optimized expansion method @xcite etc",
    ".    however , a more fundamental reason for the study of these theories is also well known .",
    "indeed , there are a lot of condensed matter systems which , firstly , have a ( quasi-)planar structure and , secondly , their low - energy excitation spectrum is described adequately by relativistic dirac - like equation rather than by schrdinger one .",
    "we suppose that some physical system is localized in the spatially two - dimensional plane perpendicular to the @xmath4 coordinate axis of usual tree - dimensional space .",
    "moreover , there is an external homogeneous and time independent magnetic field @xmath5 tilted with respect to this plane .",
    "the corresponding ( 3 + 1)-dimensional vector potential @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 we assume that the planar physical system consists of quasi - particles ( electrons ) with two spin projections , @xmath101/2 , on the direction of magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , it is also supposed that their low - energy dynamics is described by the following ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gross - neveu type lagrangian @xmath11\\psi_{ka}+ \\frac{g}{n}\\left ( \\sum_{k=1}^{2}\\bar \\psi_{ka}\\psi_{ka}\\right ) ^2 , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and the summation over the repeated index @xmath13 of the internal @xmath14 group is implied . for each fixed value of @xmath15 and @xmath13 the quantity @xmath16 in ( 1 )",
    "means the dirac fermion field , transforming over a reducible 4-component spinor representation .",
    "we suppose that spinor fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath13 ) correspond to electrons with spin projections 1/2 and -1/2 on the direction of an external magnetic field , respectively . in ( 1 )",
    "the @xmath19-term is introduced in order to take into account the zeeman interaction energy of electrons with external magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "hence , in our case @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the spectroscopic lande factor and @xmath0 is an electron magnetic moment , i.e. the bohr magneton . the model ( 1 )",
    "is invariant under the discrete chiral transformation , @xmath23 .",
    "certainly , there is the @xmath14 invariance of the lagrangian ( 1 ) .",
    "finally note that at @xmath24 the quasi - particle spectrum of the model ( 1 ) is just the same as in the monolayer graphene @xcite , but at @xmath25 one can interpret our results as occurring in the @xmath3-layered system .    in the following we use an auxiliary theory with the lagrangian density @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and from now on @xmath29 ( in this formula and below the summation over repeated indices is implied ) .",
    "clearly , the lagrangians ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are equivalent .    in the leading order of the large-@xmath3 approximation ,",
    "the effective action @xmath30 of the considered model is expressed by means of the path integral over fermion fields @xmath31[d\\psi_{ka}]\\exp\\bigl(i\\int { \\cal    l}\\,d^3 x\\bigr),\\ ] ]    in the leading order of the large-@xmath3 expansion the tdp is defined by the following expression : @xmath32      the tdp of the gn model with single @xmath14 multiplet of dirac spinors and at nonzero values of a chemical potential and @xmath35 was obtained , e.g. , in @xcite . taking into account the fact that in our case each of two @xmath14 multiplets has its own chemical potential @xmath36 , one can easily generalize the results of @xcite and find the following expression for the renormalized tdp of the gn model ( 1 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the tdp @xmath40",
    "suppose for a moment that @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath42 .",
    "there is a straight line @xmath43 in the @xmath44-plane , tangent to a critical curve @xmath45 at the point @xmath46 , such that the whole @xmath44-region above @xmath43 belongs to a symmetric phase of the model .",
    "it is clear that @xmath47 moreover , any straight line @xmath48 with @xmath49 crosses the region of the @xmath44-plane , corresponding to a chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "now , as it was intended from the very beginning , we suppose that @xmath5 and @xmath19 are dependent quantities and , furthermore , that the external magnetic field @xmath5 is perpendicular to a system plane , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "hence , in the case under consideration only the points of the straight line @xmath52 of the above mentioned @xmath44-plane are relevant to a real physical situation ( evidently , @xmath53 ) .",
    "so , if @xmath54 , i.e. at sufficiently small values of @xmath55 , then the straight line @xmath56 as a whole is above the line @xmath43 ( [ 26 ] ) , and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is forbidden in the system . however , if the coupling constant @xmath55 is greater than @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 and the line @xmath56 is below @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , in this case the straight line @xmath51 crosses the region of the @xmath44-plane with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , at @xmath59 chiral symmetry might be broken only for some finite interval of @xmath35-values .",
    "it means that the magnetic catalysis effect at @xmath60 and @xmath1 , i.e. when the zeeman interaction of electrons with magnetic field is taken into account , is qualitatively different from the case with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , i ) at @xmath61 the external ( arbitrary small ) magnetic field @xmath35 induces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at arbitrary values of @xmath41 , whereas at @xmath1 chiral symmetry might be broken by @xmath35 only at @xmath62 .",
    "ii ) if @xmath59 , then at @xmath1 the chiral symmetry is allowed to be spontaneously broken only for rather small values of @xmath35 , i.e. at @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "the symmetry is restored at sufficiently high values of @xmath65 .",
    "in contrast , if the zeeman interaction is neglected , we have @xmath66 for arbitrary @xmath41 .    to illustrate these circumstances we made some numerical investigations of the tdp ( [ 2300 ] ) at @xmath50 .",
    "for example , we have found that at @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 the corresponding critical values @xmath70 of the perpendicular magnetic field at which there is a restoration of the chiral symmetry are the following , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the dynamical electron mass ( or the gap ) @xmath74 vs @xmath35 in the particular case @xmath69 is presented in fig .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the gap is an increasing function vs @xmath35 up to a critical value @xmath75 , where it vanishes sharply , i.e. the first order phase transition occurs .",
    "now let us consider the general case when @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 . in this case",
    "the mass gap @xmath74 is really a function of two independent quantities , @xmath35 and @xmath42 , with an additional evident physical constraint @xmath78 . investigating properties of the global minimum point of the tdp ( [ 2300 ] ) , depending on @xmath35 and @xmath42 , it is possible to obtain a corresponding phase portrait of the model . for a typical value of the parameter @xmath69 the phase structure of the model",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "it is clear from the figure that at arbitrary small and perpendicular external magnetic field @xmath5 , such that @xmath79 ( see the previous paragraphs ) , the system is in the chiral symmetry broken phase 2 .",
    "then , the chiral symmetry can be restored by two qualitatively different ways .",
    "first , one may increase the strength of @xmath5 , or , second , it is possible simply to tilt @xmath5 with respect to a system plane . in the last case , not too high deflection angle @xmath80 of the magnetic field is needed ( @xmath81 , where @xmath80 is the angle between @xmath5 and the normal to the system plane ) in order to restore the symmetry .",
    "+      +      now , let us consider the magnetization @xmath82 of the system under influence of an external tilted magnetic field at @xmath41 . at fixed angle @xmath80 between @xmath5 and the normal to the system plane",
    ", we define the magnetization by the following relation @xmath83 where @xmath74 is the mass gap .",
    "it is possible to obtain @xmath84 where the notations of the expression ( [ 2300 ] ) are used .",
    "the plot of the function ( [ 28 ] ) @xmath82 vs @xmath35 is presented in figs 3 and 4 in two particular cases @xmath69 and @xmath85 , correspondingly , at fixed value of @xmath42 such that @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear from these figures that in the region of small values of @xmath35 the quantity ( [ 28 ] ) is a highly oscillating function .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is fixed .",
    "since all terms of the series in ( [ 28 ] ) are positive quantities , one can conclude that in the region of sufficiently small @xmath35 magnetization as a whole are also positive quantities .",
    "hence , at small values of @xmath35 the ground state of the model is a paramagnetic one .",
    "the situation can be changed , if @xmath35 approaches @xmath42 . in this case , depending on the relation between dimensionless parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 , one can obtain quite different magnetic properties of the ground state . really , if @xmath89 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "4 ) , then the magnetization is positive for all physical values of @xmath35 , @xmath90 , and the system is in the paramagnetic ground state . however , for a sufficiently small values of @xmath91 there is an interval of rather large values of @xmath35 , the magnetization @xmath82 are negative quantities , so we have in this case a diamagnetic ground state of the system .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "3 a graph of the magnetization @xmath82 vs @xmath35 is drown at fixed @xmath42 and at @xmath92 .",
    "clearly , in this case the system is in the paramagnetic state if @xmath93 , and it is a diamagnetic one at @xmath94 .",
    "it is possible to find the following asymptotic behavior of the magnetization ( [ 28 ] ) at @xmath95 and arbitrary fixed @xmath42 ( recall , @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 remark , the leading asymptotic term in this expression , i.e. the first term in the right hand side of ( [ 30 ] ) , is the magnetization corresponding to the tdp with zero @xmath35 component of an external magnetic field .",
    "moreover , an infinite series in ( [ 30 ] ) is no more than fourier expansion of the periodic function @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "its period is equal to unity and in the interval @xmath100 it looks like @xmath101 .",
    "note , in condensed matter systems , both nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite , magnetic oscillations usually occur in the presence of chemical potential @xmath102 , i.e. in the systems with @xmath103 magnetic oscillations are absent as a rule .",
    "however , as it follows from our consideration in systems with planar structure magnetic oscillations can be induced even at @xmath103 by tilting the external magnetic field with respect to a system plane .",
    "in the present section we study the influence of an external magnetic field on the properties of the initial model ( 1 ) at @xmath104 , i.e. at supercritical values of the bare coupling constant , @xmath105 .",
    "recall , when the zeeman interaction is not taken into account the chiral symmetry breaking , induced originally in this case by a rather strong coupling , is enhanced additionally by external magnetic field ( see , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "it means that dynamical mass of electrons is an increasing function vs @xmath35 throughout the interval @xmath106 ( in this case @xmath107 does not influence the properties of the model ) .",
    "it turns out that zeeman interaction drastically changes properties of the model .",
    "first , let us suppose that external magnetic field @xmath5 is directed normally to a system plane , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath60 . for simplicity , we fix the value of @xmath55 by the relation @xmath108 . investigating in this case the tdp ( [ 2300 ] ) as well as the gap equation , we have found the behavior of the mass gap @xmath74 vs @xmath35 ( it is the curve 1 in fig .",
    "it turns out that up to a some critical value @xmath109 ( such that @xmath110 ) the enhancement scenario is realized , i.e. the mass gap is an increasing function vs @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , in this chirally broken phase the gap @xmath74 takes rather large values , such that @xmath111 .",
    "consequently , the contribution to the magnetization @xmath82 coming from the zeeman interaction vanishes , i.e. all terms of the series in ( [ 28 ] ) are zero . as a result",
    ", the magnetization in this phase is completely determined by an interaction of @xmath5 with orbital angular momentum . due to this reason @xmath82 is negative at @xmath112 ( see fig . 5 , where the curve 2 corresponds to a magnetization ) , and the ground state of this phase is a diamagnetic one .",
    "then , in the critical point @xmath113 the mass gap @xmath74 jumps to a significantly smaller nonzero value , and there is a phase transition of the first order to another chirally broken phase .",
    "further increasing of @xmath35 leads to a restoration of the chiral symmetry at @xmath114 , where @xmath115 .",
    "it is a second order phase transition , since in this point the mass gap @xmath74 continuously turns into zero ( see fig .",
    "note also that both in the second chirally broken phase ( at @xmath116 ) and in the chirally symmetric one ( at @xmath117 ) the magnetization of the system is positive , i.e. the ground states of these phases are paramagnetic ( see fig .",
    "now , a few words about a response of the system with @xmath104 upon an arbitrarily directed external magnetic field , i.e. when @xmath118 . numerical investigations of the tdp ( [ 2300 ] ) , where for simplicity we put @xmath108 , bring us to the phase portrait of the model presented in fig .",
    "the number 1 corresponds to a chirally symmetric paramagnetic phase , whereas notations 2 and 3 are used for two different chirally broken phases .",
    "the first of them , i.e. the phase 2 , is a diamagnetic with @xmath119 , however the second one , i.e. the phase 3 , is a phase with paramagnetic ground state , since in this region @xmath120 .",
    "note , at @xmath104 one can also observe the oscillations of the magnetization only in the chirally symmetric phase 1 when @xmath121 .",
    "as it is clear from figs 5 and 6 the presence of the zeeman interaction significantly changes the behavior of the chiral symmetry under influence of an external both perpendicular and tilted magnetic field at @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath1 the enhancement of a chiral condensation in this case takes place only at sufficiently small values of @xmath42 , i.e. in the phase 2 of fig .",
    "6 ( it means that fixing the tilting angle of the magnetic field we obtain the growth of the mass gap @xmath74 at increasing @xmath42 ) .",
    "further increasing of @xmath42 leads ultimately to a chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "+      clearly , for other relations between @xmath122 and @xmath0 , i.e. at @xmath123 , the @xmath124-phase portrait of the model might be quite different from fig .",
    "to imagine the phase structure of the model for an arbitrary , but fixed , relation between @xmath122 and @xmath0 it is very convenient to use for its description the new dimensionless parameters , @xmath125 and @xmath126 assuming for a moment that @xmath127 and @xmath128 are fully independent quantities , it is possible to investigate the behavior of the global minimum point of the tdp ( 25 ) as a function of @xmath127 and @xmath128 and then to obtain the @xmath129-phase portrait of the model depicted in figs 7 and/or 8 .",
    "( the line l of these figures should be ignored in this case .",
    "note also that in fig .",
    "8 the phase portrait is depicted for a more extended region of the parameter @xmath128 . ) there one can see only three different phases which were already presented in fig .",
    "so we use the same notations for them , 1 , 2 and 3 . in reality",
    ", there is a constraint between @xmath127 and @xmath128 which is due to the physical requirement @xmath78 . in terms of @xmath127 and",
    "@xmath128 it looks like @xmath130 , where @xmath131 , i.e. not the whole @xmath129-plates of figs 7 and 8 can be considered as a phase diagram , but only those areas which are below the line l. the points of the line l correspond to a perpendicular external magnetic field , i.e. we have @xmath132 on the line l. clearly , if the quantity @xmath131 varies , then the line l of figs 7 and 8 changes its slope and , as a result , the allowed physical region which is below l is also changed .",
    "however , the positions and forms of the critical curves in figs 7 , 8 are not changed at different values of the parameter @xmath133 .",
    "it is easily seen from fig . 8",
    "that inside the interval @xmath134 the critical curve @xmath135 of the phase diagram can be approximated by a straight line with a slope coefficient @xmath136 . extrapolating this behavior of the curve @xmath135 to the region with higher @xmath128-values",
    ", one can conclude that a typical phase portrait of the initial model corresponding to the weak coupling @xmath122 , such that @xmath137 , is presented in fig .",
    "7 ( it is the region just below the line l ) . in this case",
    "the line l certainly crosses critical curve @xmath135 of a phase portrait , i.e. it passes through several different phases , including the chirally symmetric phase 1 . as a result",
    ", one can see that at @xmath138 the chiral symmetry is always restored at @xmath139 irrespective of the magnetic field directions ( even at a perpendicular magnetic field ) .",
    "in particular , the case @xmath140 was considered in details in the previous section iv a , and fig .",
    "7 at @xmath140 coincides with the phase diagram of fig . 6 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath141 then a typical phase portrait of the model is depicted in fig .",
    "8 ( it is a region which is below and/or to the right of the line l ) . clearly , in this case the line l does not cross any of the critical curves of the phase diagram , and at arbitrary values of a _ perpendicular _ magnetic field the chiral symmetry can not be restored , since we move along the line l when @xmath50 increases . however , if @xmath42 reaches the values corresponding to @xmath142 , then in this case at fixed @xmath143 it is also possible to restore the symmetry by tilting the magnetic field away from the normal direction . in particular , if the parameter @xmath127 lies , e.g. , in the interval @xmath144 ( see fig .",
    "8) , then a number of phase transitions can occur in the system that are also caused only by the inclination of an external magnetic field .",
    "+      now let us estimate the order of magnitude of the magnetic field at which the phase transitions of figs 6 , 7 , 8 might take place in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional condensed matter systems . to this end",
    "it is necessary to take into account in the lagrangian ( 1 ) the fermi velocity of quasi - particles @xmath145 . using the same calculational technique as in sec .",
    "ii of the present paper and/or , e.g. , in @xcite , it is possible to obtain the thermodynamic potential @xmath146 for the case @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , there is a very simple connection between @xmath146 and the renormalized tdp ( [ 2300 ] ) corresponding to @xmath147 .",
    "namely , one should perform in ( [ 2300 ] ) the replacements @xmath148 , @xmath149 ( note , the zeeman term @xmath150 remains unchanged in this case ) and then multiply the obtained expression by the factor @xmath151 .",
    "suppose that @xmath104 .",
    "then , in the particular case of @xmath152 the tdp @xmath146 thus obtained from the tdp @xmath153 of the case @xmath147 has already the global minimum at the point @xmath154 ( it is the mass gap of the system ) .",
    "since in all numerical calculations of the case @xmath147 an arbitrary dimensional quantity is converted into a dimensionless one by multiplying it with an appropriate powers of @xmath122 , in the case @xmath145 the powers of @xmath155 should be used instead .",
    "so , at @xmath145 the analogs of the @xmath129-phase diagrams of figs 7 , 8 are just the same figures , but with the new @xmath156- , @xmath157-axes , where @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "( in the following , when referring to figs 7 , 8 in the case @xmath145 , we imply that instead of @xmath127 and @xmath128 the new parameters @xmath156 and @xmath157 should be used in these figures . )",
    "the line l , below which the physical region is arranged , has the form @xmath160 , where @xmath161 .",
    "it is clear from figs 7 , 8 that at @xmath46 and @xmath145 the phase transition of the first order occurs at in - plane magnetic field @xmath162 corresponding to @xmath163 , i.e. @xmath164 . since the value of the mass gap @xmath165 in condensed matter systems is typically of the order of 1 - 10 mev , one can easily obtain that the magnitude of the critical magnetic field @xmath162 is of order of 14 - 140 teslas , correspondingly .",
    "it is clear from figs 7 , 8 that at @xmath34 the magnitudes of @xmath42 , at which one can observe phase transitions , are even less and might be as small as 0.7@xmath162 .",
    "if @xmath166 and @xmath167 , as in graphene , then the slope factor @xmath168 of the line l is approximately equal to 10@xmath169 at @xmath170 mev , whereas it is of order of 10@xmath171 at @xmath172 mev , i.e. @xmath173 .",
    "hence , just the phase diagram of fig .",
    "8 refers to graphene - like planar systems .",
    "note , up to now we have estimated phase transitions in the systems with @xmath166 .",
    "however , still smaller values of the critical magnetic field @xmath162 are realized in the planar gapless semiconductors at smaller values of @xmath174 , e.g. , at @xmath175 .",
    "in addition , in this case the slope factor @xmath168 of the line l might be extremely small , i.e. @xmath176 .",
    "so , just the phase diagram of fig . 6 with a variety of phase transitions is relevant for such condensed matter systems .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that the effects which are due to the zeeman interaction can be observed in real condensed matter systems at reasonable laboratory magnitudes of external magnetic fields .",
    "in the present paper we investigate ( at zero temperature and chemical potential ) the response of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gn model ( 1 ) upon the action of external magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the model describes a four - fermion self - interaction of quasi - particles ( electrons ) with spin 1/2 .",
    "in addition , it describes the interaction of @xmath5 both with orbital angular momentum of electrons and with their spin .",
    "the last is known as the zeeman interaction , and it is proportional to electron magnetic moment @xmath0 which is a free model parameter in our consideration .",
    "so at @xmath61 the properties of the model were considered , e.g. , in @xcite , where in particular it was established that an external perpendicular magnetic field @xmath177 induces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at @xmath178 , or it enhances chiral condensation at @xmath105 .",
    "( such an ability of an external magnetic field is called the magnetic catalysis effect . )",
    "moreover , in this case the system responds diamagnetically on the influence of external magnetic field , i.e. its magnetization is negative . in addition , there are no magnetic oscillations of any physical quantity if the zeeman interaction is not taken into account .    in the paper",
    "we study the modifications that appear both in the magnetic catalysis effect and in the magnetization phenomena of the system when zeeman interaction is taken into consideration , i.e. at @xmath1 . to this end",
    ", we have obtained in the leading order of the large-@xmath3 expansion technique the renormalized thermodynamic potential @xmath179 ( [ 2300 ] ) , where @xmath96 .",
    "the behavior of the global minimum point of this quantity with respect to @xmath180 defines the phase structure of the model , whereas its derivative with respect to @xmath42 gives us the magnetization .",
    "note also that the renormalized tdp ( [ 2300 ] ) depends no more on the bare coupling @xmath181 .",
    "instead , it appears the dependence of the tdp on the new finite parameter @xmath55 ( note that the values @xmath41 ( @xmath104 ) correspond to the region @xmath178 ( @xmath105 ) . )",
    "the main results of our investigations are the following .",
    "\\i ) we have found that at @xmath1 and @xmath41 there is a critical coupling constant @xmath57 such that at @xmath59 an arbitrary rather weak external magnetic field @xmath5 induces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking provided that there is not too great a deviation of @xmath5 from a vertical as well as that @xmath182 , where @xmath183 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at @xmath184 chiral symmetry can not be broken by an external magnetic field .",

    "\\ii ) suppose that @xmath1 , @xmath62 and chiral symmetry is broken , i.e. @xmath5 has a rather large @xmath35 component .",
    "then chiral symmetry can be restored simply by tilting magnetic field to a system plane , i.e. without any increase of its modulus @xmath42 .",
    "\\iv ) if @xmath1 and @xmath104 , then the phase structure and magnetic properties of the model are much richer than in the case of @xmath187 , @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , it is clear from figs 6 , 7 and 8 that at non - vanishing zeeman interaction the phase portrait of the model contains at least two chirally nonsymmetric phases , denoted as 2 and 3 . in the phase 2 , which is a diamagnetic one ,",
    "the enhancement of the chiral symmetry is occurred , whereas in the paramagnetic phase 3 it is absent . moreover , if in addition the parameter @xmath188 , then at sufficiently high values of @xmath42 ( even at a perpendicular magnetic field ) the restoration of the chiral symmetry is occurred in the model .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath2 and @xmath104 only the diamagnetic phase 2 with enhancement of the chiral symmetry breaking is realized in the model at arbitrary values and directions of @xmath5 , such that @xmath189 .",

    "8 can be extrapolated to the region @xmath190 by a straight line with a slope coefficient @xmath136 , we see that at @xmath104 and @xmath191 the line l of fig . 8",
    "does not cross any of the critical curves of the figure .",
    "so , in this case at an arbitrary perpendicular magnetic field chiral symmetry can not be restored . however , tilting the magnetic field away from a normal position , it is possible to restore the symmetry . as our numerical estimates show ( see in sec .",
