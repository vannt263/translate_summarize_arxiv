    "the idea that globular clusters ( gcs ) are good tracers of very early events in the lives of galaxies was put forward many years ago ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a thorough description of all the important aspects is given , for example , in @xcite .",
    "however , some key issues , such as the relation between gcs and galaxy field stars , still remain as open questions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if such a relation does exist , some galaxy properties could be described in terms of the characteristics of their globular cluster systems ( gcs ) .",
    "a tentative approach in this direction ( @xcite ) assumes that gcs formation efficiency depends on chemical abundance , and leads to a quantitative connection between field stars and gcs . in turn",
    ", this type of connection allows further analysis of the different gcs - galaxy formation scenarios found in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work we present new photometry for the gcs of five early - type galaxies , using the imaging capabilities of the gmos instruments on the gemini telescopes .",
    "this is part of a long term study to obtain both imaging and spectra for these gcs .",
    "our first spectroscopic results were published for ngc 3379 @xcite , ngc 3923 @xcite and ngc 4649 ( @xcite ) . in particular , we aim at a detailed characterization of the most relevant photometric features of each gcs , such as colour bimodality , galactocentric colour gradients , spatial distributions , and the presence ( or absence ) of the so called `` blue tilt '' in the colour - magnitude diagrams of the gcs .",
    "all of these results will be later analyzed in combination with the final spectroscopic sample .",
    "additionally , a search for ultra compact dwarf ( ucd ) candidates was performed in each galaxy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the galaxy sample is described in section 2 , photometric observations and data handling in section 3 , results in terms of colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams , colour histograms , spatial distributions , galactocentric colour gradients and gc integrated luminosity functions are presented in section 4 and , finally , a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "our sample consists of five nearby early - type galaxies that cover a range of mass .",
    "these galaxies have been imaged in several filters over multiple pointings with the gmos instrument on the gemini telescopes .",
    "basic data for the sample studied in this paper , ordered by decreasing luminosity ( and presumably decreasing mass ) are listed in table [ tsample ] .",

    "we have adopted the distance modulus from the surface brightness fluctuation method presented by @xcite .",
    "this provides an homogeneous source which can easily be converted to other distance scales , such as that of @xcite . in the following we give a short description of each galaxy with references to earlier work pertaining to their gcs .",

    "the images taken with the _ i@xmath0 _ band filter on gemini south show considerable fringing .",

    "galaxy light subtraction was done using an iterative combination of the sextractor background modelling approach ( @xcite ) and median filtering , in a similar way to that presented in @xcite .",
    "this procedure was implemented in a script which yields a catalogue of all the objects detected by sextractor and a galaxy light subtracted image .",
    "this software gives better results than iraf tasks such as daofind .",
    "as in @xcite , the _ i@xmath0 _ band objects list was adopted as input for the subsequent photometry . at the distance of the targets listed in table [ tsample ] most of the gcs",
    "would be expected to be unresolved ( starlike ) sources .",
    "the daophot package @xcite within iraf was used to obtain psf magnitudes for all objects detected by sextractor , and they were then separated into resolved and unresolved objects following the outline presented in section [ clas ] .",
    "after that , aperture photometry was obtained for all the resolved objects . for this purpose",
    "we have used the phot task with a fixed 2 arcsecond aperture .",
    "this means that we have good photometry for unresolved and marginally resolved objects .",
    "a `` master '' catalogue of resolved and unresolved objects was built by combining photometry of objects successfully measured in all three filters .",
    "we searched in the gsa for standard star fields observed during the same nights as our targets and the comparison field .",
    "they were re - reduced using the same biases and flats applied to our science frames . the synthetic transformation from @xcite",
    "was adopted to obtain the _",
    "g@xmath0 , r@xmath0 , i@xmath0 _ standard magnitudes .",
    "because of the small number of the available standards , usually 3 - 4 stars , and their very limited range in airmass , this calibration was suitable only for establishing a mean zero - point value for our frames , and not for a more complete evaluation of the coefficients in airmass or colour ( see table [ tphot ] ) . thus , we measured these zero points , and we used the atmospheric extinction coefficients given by the gemini web page .",
    "ngc 4649 is an exception because standards were not observed at the same night as our program fields .",
    "so , in this case , we adopted the mean zero points obtained from the three sets of standards ( about five stars per field ) observed during the gemini north gmos run of march 2007 .    for each galaxy , the field with the best overall seeing in the three filters and having a corresponding standard stars field ,",
    "was adopted as the reference for the photometry .",
    "a list of common objects in each field was used to obtain any small zero point differences among the pointings .",
    "finally , we applied the galactic extinction coefficients given by @xcite , and used their table 6 to transform them into _ a@xmath23 , a@xmath24 _ and _ a@xmath25_. thus we quote extinction corrected magnitudes and colours in this paper .",

    "deep gmos multi - colour photometry has been obtained for the gcs of five early type galaxies .",
    "the primary results of this study , that will be combined with the spectroscopic results for a further discussion in a following paper , are :    * all the studied gcs show bimodal integrated colour - distributions .",
    "even the less clear case , ngc 524 , appears bimodal when analyzed with the rmix software .",
    "the adoption of a mass to luminosity ratio @xmath133= 8 indicates a minimum stellar mass close to @xmath134 for our galaxy sample , i.e. , all these systems are above the minimum mass where bimodality becomes detectable as a common feature ( @xcite ) . * the mean colour of the peaks of red gcs",
    "follow a well defined luminosity - colour relation in the sense that these peaks become redder with increasing galaxy luminosity .",
    "this is indicative of a larger gcs chemical abundance scale for the most luminous galaxies which , being more massive , are also able of a more efficient enrichment .",
    "we note that the most massive system in this work ( ngc 4649 ) lies outside the plane defined by gc systems in the logarithmic 3-d space determined by galaxy stellar mass , projected stellar mass density and gcs formation efficiency , possibly indicating a merger past history as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the gc blue peaks , in turn , show no significant correlation or , possibly , only a very mild one , with galaxy luminosity a situation already noted in the literature @xcite . *",
    "an empirical _ ( g@xmath0-i@xmath0 ) _ vs [ z / h ] relation was obtained based solely on gmos data . a linear fit yields : @xmath15=3.51(\\pm 0.21 ) ( g'-i')_0   - 3.91 ( \\pm0.20)$ ] , which provides a good approximation , although the eventual presence of a second order term at the low metallicity end will require the inclusion of more gcs . * a comparison of the colour spreads of both blue and red gcs , once transformed to metallicity , clearly indicates that both populations are widely different in terms of chemical abundance , a fact that when associated with the different spatial distributions of these subpopulations , strongly indicates a distinct nature for the two populations . * a number of resolved / marginally resolved gc candidates were detected in all five galaxies .",
    "some of them are spectroscopically confirmed as gcs in the literature . in principle",
    "the gcs upper mass shows a dependence with galaxy luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) and then the detection of resolved clusters could be a more frequent situation in these systems",
    ". however , further analysis will require the inclusion of distance effects .",
    "* a population of ultra compact dwarf ( ucd ) candidates ( resolved and unresolved ones with 15 @xmath14 _ m@xmath40 _ @xmath14 12 ) were also detected in all the galaxies .",
    "ngc 3923 shows the highest number of associated objects , followed by ngc4649 and ngc 3115 .",
    "this result indicates that ucds are indeed a common feature although the small size of our sample does not allow a definite conclusion in statistical terms .",
    "* this paper reports the first detection of the so called `` blue tilt '' in ngc 4649 using ground based observations . as a first approach we adopted a linear relation between gc colours and magnitudes although ,",
    "as shown by @xcite on the basis of a more numerous gcs sample , the tilt may exhibit some degree of curvature that becomes more evident for the brightest clusters .",
    "the tilt translates into an approximate mass - metallicity relation , given by _ z",
    "@xmath2 @xmath3_. this result is in excellent agreement withe the mean trend obtained by @xcite . *",
    "all the gcs density profiles are reasonably well fitted by a power law , although , in the case of ngc 4649 , an r@xmath98 dependence produces a better fit in terms of the residuals . as found in other galaxies ,",
    "the red gcs show a more concentrated spatial distribution than the blue ones , again lending support to the idea that bimodality is a real and distinctive feature and not a mere result of a particular colour - metallicity relation . *",
    "we confirm the very low spatial concentration of the ngc 3923 gcs found by @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these authors , we find a significant difference of the areal density slopes of the red and blue gcs .",
    "* we have measured radial colour gradients for the blue and red gc subpopulations separately , and find evidence for statistically significant gradients in several galaxies out to several effective radii ( tens of kpc ) .",
    "the steeper ones are those present in the two s0 galaxies included in the sample .",
    "these galaxies have smaller stellar masses than the brightest ellipticals in this study showing shallower gradients .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who find a non monotonic behaviour of colour gradients with galaxy mass .",
    "a possible interpretation of this trend assumes that more massive galaxies may have experienced mergers that lead to a dilution of the chemical gradients . * like in other studied systems , the red gc subpopulation has similar colours to the galaxy halo stars in their inner region .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that most of the galaxy luminosity in these regions comes from a diffuse stellar population associated with these clusters ( e.g. , ffg07 ) . *",
    "the tom and @xmath64 were determined for the gclf of ngc 4649 and ngc 3115 . in the case of ngc 3923 , only @xmath64 was fitted .",
    "this parameter and the density profiles were used to obtain the total gcs populations , and the specific frequency @xmath124 of these galaxies . the highest @xmath135 value was obtained for ngc 3923 , followed by ngc 4649 , @xmath136 .",
    "we have obtained new estimations of the ngc 3115 and ngc 3379 specific frequencies ; @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",

    "<S> this paper presents deep high quality photometry of globular cluster ( gc ) systems belonging to five early - type galaxies covering a range of mass and environment . </S>",
    "<S> photometric data were obtained with the gemini north and gemini south telescopes in the filter passbands _ g@xmath0 _ , _ </S>",
    "<S> r@xmath0 _ , and _ </S>",
    "<S> i@xmath0_. the combination of these filters with good seeing conditions allows an excellent separation between gc candidates and unresolved field objects . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our previously published spectroscopic data indicates a contamination level of only @xmath110 percent in our sample of gc candidates . </S>",
    "<S> bimodal gc colour distributions are found in all five galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> most of the gc systems appear bimodal even in the _ </S>",
    "<S> ( g@xmath0-r@xmath0 ) _ vs _ ( r@xmath0-i@xmath0 ) _ plane . </S>",
    "<S> a population of resolved / marginally resolved gc and ultra compact dwarf candidate*s * was found in all the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> a search for the so - called `` blue tilt '' in the colour - magnitude diagrams reveals that ngc 4649 clearly shows that phenomenon although no conclusive evidence was found for the other galaxies in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this `` blue tilt '' translates into a mass - metallicity relation given by _ z @xmath2 @xmath3_. this dependence was found using a new empirical _ ( g@xmath0-i@xmath0 ) _ vs [ z / h ] relation which relies on an homogeneous sample of gc colours and metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> this paper also explores the radial trends in both colour and surface density for the blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - rich ) gc subpopulations . as usual , the red gcs show a steeper radial distribution than the blue ones . </S>",
    "<S> evidence of galactocentric colour gradients is found in some of the gc systems , being more significant for the two s0 galaxies in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> red gc subpopulations show similar colours and gradients to the galaxy halo stars in their inner region . </S>",
    "<S> a gc mean colour - galaxy luminosity relation , consistent with _ [ z / h ] @xmath4 _ , is present for the red gcs . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of the total gc populations and specific frequency s@xmath5 values is presented for ngc 3115 , ngc 3923 and ngc 4649 .    </S>",
