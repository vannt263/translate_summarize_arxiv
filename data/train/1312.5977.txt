    "despite being an extremely succesful theory to predict the outcome of experiments with particles and other microscopic objects , quantum mechanics ( qm ) is believed by many to be incomplete or , at least , not fully understood .",
    "in particular , the  strange \" or non - classical phenomena of qm , like self - interference and born s rule , are described in terms of abstract mathematical objects .",
    "although some have been ready to interpret the complex - valued wavefunction as a real object , wavefunctions are generally seen as mathematical tools serving to calculate probabilities from their square moduli .",
    "contrasting to real - valued mathematics and one - to - one mapping between real variables and observables of classical theories , the standard description is thus sometimes considered as purely operational .    in this paper a model is presented that , although very simple in terms of mathematical development and formalism , seems to be able to predict probability fields of at least free particles , and particularly self - interference , without using schrdinger equation or wavefunctions . unlike the standard qm picture , the proposed model only uses integer - valued quantities and arithmetic operations . in particular , it assumes a discrete spacetime under the form of an euclidean lattice .",
    "the proposed approach describes individual particle trajectories as random walks .",
    "transition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are either randomly associated to the particles during their preparation , or stored in the lattice sites they visit during the walk .",
    "non - relativistic qm predictions are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly - prepared ensembles of particles .",
    "the proposed model goes beyond ensemble interpretations @xcite in the sense that it describes the behavior of individual particles . with respect to de broglie ",
    "bohm mechanics @xcite , or deterministic trajectory representation @xcite , the proposed model introduces a non - deterministic behavior but does not appeal to non - localities .",
    "intrinsec ideterminism is already contained in stochastic interpretations of qm that are , however , mostly aimed at retrieving the schrdinger equation from a classical equation of motion plus a stochastic force .",
    "the born probability rule remains unexplained in this context @xcite , or is founded on the definition of probability density of particles as the squared intensity of an associated wave @xcite .",
    "this latter assumption is not used in the proposed approach , which in contrast predicts nonclassical consequences of born rule ( as double - slit interference ) only from the random walk features .",
    "the idea of lattice or discrete - time algorithms that reproduce particle propagation in the continuum limit is also not new .",
    "however , the proposed model uses the lattice only as the support for particle motion , not for wavefunctions or other mathematical operators as , e.g. , in @xcite . while other random walks or spacetime quantizations @xcite are able to reproduce the emergence of schrdinger equation from pure combinatorics , again the born probability rule and thus intereference are not explained in such models , while naturally emerges in the proposed one . in order to reproduce interference , antiparticles are not appealed to , as in some abstract lattice gas models for waves @xcite , nor negative probabilities .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the assumptions concerning spacetime , which naturally lead to heisemberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "section  3 describes the model for free motion without quantum forces and retrieves de broglie relation and schrdinger equation .",
    "section  4 describes the model with quantum forces and shows numerical results for several self - interference scenarios .",
    "section  5 is just a short introduction to possible extensions to treat interacting particles and the transition to relativistic qm .",
    "the proposed model assumes that the spacetime is inherently discrete . limiting for simplicity the analysis to one dimension @xmath0 , that means that only values @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are meaningful .",
    "noninteger values of space and time are simply impossible in this picture .",
    "the two fundamental quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the size of the lattice that constitutes the space and the fundamental temporal resolution , respectively .    under this assumption ,",
    "a particle s history consists of a succession of points @xmath7 in the spacetime , where @xmath8 is the discrete index that describes advance in history , here denoted as  iteration \" .",
    "advance in time is unidirectional and unitary , that is , @xmath9 follows necessarily @xmath10 .",
    "advance in space is still unitary but bidirectional .",
    "if in a certain iteration a particle resides at the location @xmath11 of the spatial lattice , in the next iteration the particle can only reside at locations @xmath12 , @xmath11 , or @xmath13 .",
    "the local velocity of this mechanism , @xmath14 , is a random variable that can take only the three discrete values @xmath15 , as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : single ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : interf ] .",
    "consider for the moment only free motion , without interference , such that @xmath16 .",
    "the observable velocity of the particle as the result of a observation process lasting @xmath17 iterations or time steps ( @xmath17 is arbitrary ) would be @xmath18 the maximum velocity that a particle can reach is the speed of light @xmath19 .",
    "light trajectory in the positive direction corresponds to @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "consequently to ( [ eqn : v ] ) , one constraint to the fundamental lattice quantities is necessarily @xmath22    another consequence of ( [ eqn : v ] ) is that to determine the average velocity of a particle , an observer should wait in principle a time @xmath17 tending to infinity .",
    "every observation lasting a finite number of iterations @xmath17 will give an approximation of @xmath23 .",
    "consider , e.g. , @xmath24 .",
    "the observed velocity can be @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "thus the uncertainty on @xmath23 is @xmath19 in absolute value . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the possible outcomes for the sample mean are @xmath19 , @xmath29 , @xmath26 , @xmath30 , and @xmath27 .",
    "thus the uncertainty on @xmath23 is @xmath29 in absolute value .",
    "extending these considerations , the uncertainty on @xmath23 after an observation lasting @xmath17 iterations is @xmath31 in lattice units .",
    "moreover , an observation lasting @xmath17 iterations necessarily implies a change in the position of the particle .",
    "the span of the particle during the observation ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "thus the uncertainty on the position of the particle at the end of the observation is @xmath34 in lattice units .    using the two results above , and denoting @xmath35 and @xmath36 the uncertainties of velocity and position as a function of observation horizon @xmath17 , the relationship @xmath37 holds .",
    "the latter equation resembles the heisenberg uncertainty principle since it fixes an inverse proportionality between the uncertainty with which the velocity of a particle can be known and the uncertainty with which its position can be known .",
    "multiplying by the particle mass @xmath38 , and comparing ( [ eqn : heis ] ) to heisenberg uncertainty principle , one obtains that the two fundamental lattice quantities are related to the planck constant , @xmath39 the term @xmath40 ( the solid angle of a sphere ) holds for three - dimensional spaces . in our example case of a one - dimensional space , this term reduces to 2 , the measure of the unit 1-sphere .",
    "thus , combining ( [ eqn : cc ] ) with the accordingly modified ( [ eqn : hbar ] ) , the values for the fundamental lattice quantities are obtained as @xmath41 and @xmath42 note that the compton wavelength is retrieved as twice the fundamental lattice size @xmath5 .",
    "the role of mass is not completely clear at this point .",
    "likely , general relativity will serve to integrate it into the picture .",
    "this section will first describe the equations of motion of a free particle in the proposed model .",
    "then , the stochastic variables associated with the motion will be analyzed .",
    "finally , the equivalence with the wavefunction picture and schrdinger equation will be retrieved .",
    "this section describes the propagation rules of a particle on the lattice , or its _",
    "dynamics_.      as stated in the previous section , time can only increase by one unit at each iteration .",
    "time is re - initialized to zero whenever the particle interacts with the environment ( external forces ) .",
    "this event is called _ preparation _ in the following .",
    "we might introduce a stochastic variable representing time at an iteration @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the most recent iteration when the particle has undergone preparation , that is , has interacted with the environment and has been actualized .",
    "however , @xmath46 would have a deterministic distribution , @xmath47 and thus it will be often replaced by its support @xmath48 in the following .",
    "consider now spatial dynamics . at each iteration ,",
    "the particle might jump to one of the nearest neighboring sites of the lattice , or stay at rest .",
    "the actual local trajectory is not deterministic , i.e. , it is not a prescribed function of previous parts of trajectory .",
    "rather , the local trajectory has the characteristics of a random walk .",
    "this point is very important and it implies that an intrinsic randomness affects the particle motion . generally , there is a different transition probability for each of the three possible transitions . in free motion without interference or external forces , these probabilities do not change with time . let me denote the transition probabilities @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "of course , @xmath52 moreover , the proposed model assumes that the expected value of @xmath53 is imprinted to the particle .",
    "this imprint is to be attributed to the preparation and is actualized every time the particle interacts with the environment ( in a way to be considered later ) .",

    ", the proposed model assumes that @xmath60 equation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) might be also interpreted in the following way : energy is the average of the  time energy \" and the  space energy \" , where the former contribution is always one , since time can only advance by one unit .",

    "the equations in the previous section , in fixing the probability of each jump at each iteration @xmath43 , define the trajectory of the particle as a random walk .",

    "consider the scenario where particles are emitted from a source located at the site @xmath66 of the lattice with an intrinsic value of @xmath54 , and thus of @xmath59 , determined by the preparation .",
    "time interval between two emissions is very large , so to exclude any interactions between successive particles .",
    "moreover , the single source excludes quantum interference .",
    "after one iteration or , equivalently , time step , the particle has a probability @xmath67 to be at the site @xmath68 , a probability @xmath69 to be at the site @xmath70 , and a probability @xmath19 to be at the site @xmath71 .",
    "after two iterations , the probabilities are : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",

    "the function ( [ eqn : rhop ] ) has a limit for large @xmath10 s that can be derived in two equivalent ways . on the one hand , the equation of motion ( [ eqn : xstoc ] ) can be reviewed in the continuum limit as a stochastic differential equation reading @xmath87dn + \\sqrt{\\mathrm{var}}[\\mathcal{v}_{n}]db ,      \\label{eqn : sde}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is a brownian motion with zero mean and unit variance .",
