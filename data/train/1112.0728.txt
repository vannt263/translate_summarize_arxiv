    "over the last decade , the observational data from supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr)@xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao)@xcite and the large scale structure surveys @xcite have confirmed that our universe at present is going through an accelerated expanding phase . till date , there has been a large number of proposals to explain such an accelerated expansion .",
    "this includes the inclusion of an unknown homogeneous matter component having a large negative pressure ( cosmological constant being the simplest example of such fluid ) , modification of gravity at large scale as well as considering the back - reaction of small scale inhomogeneities in the matter distribution .",
    "although inclusion of cosmological constant in the energy budget of the universe is a minimal way to explain the late time cosmological acceleration which is also allowed by all cosmological observations , but at the same time it is plagued with the fine tuning and the cosmic coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "scalar field models with generic features can alleviate these problems and provide an alternative to cosmological constant .",
    "these dynamical scalar field models of dark energy are broadly classified into two categories : fast roll and slow roll models dubbed freezing and thawing models . for details , see the reference @xcite . among these , thawing scalar field models are particularly interesting as they can naturally mimic equation of state very close to @xmath5 which is preferred by all the observational data .",
    "on the other hand , information about the abundance of collapsed structures as a function of mass and redshift is an important tool to study the matter distribution in the universe @xcite .",
    "a large number of cluster surveys are ongoing or being planned to be set - up in near future , e.g. , planck , erosita , wfxt which would detect a large number of clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mass functions of galaxy clusters have been measured through x - ray surveys @xcite , via weak and strong lensing studies @xcite , using optical surveys , like the sdss @xcite as well as through sunayev - zeldovich effect @xcite . in the last decade",
    "several authors have been involved in such studies and have found that the dark energy not only affects the expansion rate of the background and the distance - redshift relation but also the growth of structure in the universe @xcite .",
    "the investigation by @xcite is particularly interesting in this regard .",
    "they have analyzed the predicted cluster - size halo redshift distribution on the bass of two cluster surveys : one is the future x - ray survey based on the e - rosita satellite and the other one is the sunayev - zeldovich survey based on the south pole telescope .",
    "they found that the predictions of most of the popular dark energy models can be clearly distinguished from the concordance @xmath0cdm model based on the observations that one can have from these two surveys .",
    "hence dark energy is expected to have an impact on observables such as cluster number counts and lensing statistics @xcite .",
    "therefore , the studies of galaxy clusters would provide a useful tool to constrain the model parameters and would help to infer the properties of dark energy by discriminating among the different dark energy models .",
    "although the proper way to understand the effect of dark energy in the non - linear regime of structure formation is through the n - body numerical simulations @xcite , one can also use a simpler semi - analytical methods which are in reasonable agreement with n - body simulations .",
    "one such example is the spherical collapse model @xcite using the press - schechter formalism@xcite . to overcome the problem of over - prediction of number of low(high ) mass halos at the current epoch for the above model ,",
    "an elliptical collapse model was later proposed by @xcite .",
    "this paper extends the previous work by @xcite by further studying the most general analytic form of halo mass function introduced by @xcite for thawing type scalar field dark energy models with various potential and examine how does the de affect the abundance of cdm halos by measuring the galaxy cluster number counts .",
    "we consider both the canonical and non - canonical form of thawing dark energy models .",
    "for the completeness of the study we check the results for homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous dark energy cases .",
    "we discuss how much they deviate from the conventional @xmath0cdm model through the linearly extrapolated density contrast @xmath6 at the redshift of collapse , the number density of halo mass at some particular redshifts of collapse and also through the total cluster number counts .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "have studied the constraints on different dark energy models through cluster number counts .",
    "they assumed the cpl parametrization @xcite to model different dark energy models .",
    "but it was recently shown by @xcite that this parametrization does not correctly represent all the thawing class of scalar field models .",
    "moreover this parametrization is also not suitable for thawing scalar fields with non canonical kinetic term . hence in our analysis",
    ", we do not assume any parametrization that represents thawing class of models .",
    "instead , we consider the full system of coupled scalar field plus einstein s equations for the thawing class of scalar fields .",
    "we also put constraints on our model using the presently available cluster number data from massive x - ray clusters as obtained by @xcite . in doing this",
    "we concentrate on canonical scalar field models that deviate significantly from @xmath0cdm behaviour .",
    "the results shows that present data is not suitable to constrain the thawing scalar field potentials as well as other cosmological parameters like @xmath2 , although one can get significant constrain on the parameter @xmath3 , the rms mass fluctuation today at @xmath7 scale and a lower bound on @xmath4 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the thawing dark energy models for both canonical and non - canonical kinetic term .",
    "we discuss the background evolution for such fields considering the difference type of potentials e.i .",
    "@xmath8 ,  @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and also pngb type . in section 3 ,",
    "we sketch the derivation of the equations to calculate the linearly extrapolated density contrast , @xmath12 , at the collapsed redshift .",
    "then , we describe the halos mass function introduced by @xcite and calculate the number density and the total cluster number counts for our de models . in section 4 , we discuss the observational constrain on the thawing models and finally we draw conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in what follows , we consider a flat , homogeneous and isotropic background universe driven by non - relativistic matter and dark energy of thawing type , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "these thawing type dark energy models are characterized by the fact that in the early universe the scalar field is frozen by very large hubble damping and the scalar field starts evolving slowly down its potential at the later time .",
    "so , the equation of state ,  @xmath14 initially starts with @xmath15 and slowly departs from it in the later time .",
    "we consider both ordinary scalar field with canonical kinetic term as well as tachyon type scalar field having born - infeld type kinetic term which are minimally coupled to the gravity sector @xcite .",
    "the equation of motions for the canonical scalar field and the tachyon field are given by    @xmath16    respectively , where dot represents the differentiation w. r. t the cosmic time @xmath17 and the hubble parameter , @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the scale factor , @xmath21 is the background matter density and @xmath22 represents the dark energy density with @xmath23 .",

    "the prime denotes derivative with respect to ln@xmath30 .",
    "we solve this system of equations numerically for the mentioned potentials providing the initial conditions for @xmath31 and @xmath28 as @xmath32 , @xmath33 . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", one can easily see that smaller the value of @xmath34 , more the scalar field evolution similar to that of cosmological constant @xmath0 . to check for the maximum deviation from the cosmological constant @xmath0 , we set @xmath33 . for @xmath26",
    "we choose its initial value in such away so that to get required value at present .",
    "the different types of potential we considered are @xmath35 ,  @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and they correspond to @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "we also considered the pseudo - nambu goldstone boson model ( pngb ) @xcite which has been characterized by the potential : @xmath41\\ ] ] with @xmath42 . to solve the above of system of equations",
    ", one needs a third initial condition for @xmath26 .",
    "the parameters for the potentials , @xmath43 or @xmath44 can be related to this initial value for @xmath26 .",
    "moreover this initial value for @xmath26 can be related to its value at present , @xmath45 .",
    "hence once we choose the form of the potentials and the initial values for @xmath31 and @xmath28 as mentioned above , the only free parameter for the background evolution is @xmath45 or @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of the potential parameters can be known from its value .    similarly , for the thawing tachyon field models , the autonomous system of equations is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here",
    "also we set the initial conditions similar to the canonical scalar field case and consider the power law potentials as mentioned above .",
    "for the detail calculations see @xcite .",
    "one can see the behaviour of the equation of state parameter @xmath49 from the figure [ fig : wz ] for the various models we considered .",
    "the different models have a maximum deviation when one approaches the present day however they behave almost identically in the past .     for different scalar field and tachyon models .",
    "solid curves represent different tachyon models with @xmath50 respectively from top to bottom , dashed curves from top to bottom represent different scalar field models with same potentials as in tachyon .",
    "dotted curve represents pngb model .",
    "the studies of the mass function of collapsed objects like clusters of galaxies can be used to constrain the cosmological models and can help to infer the properties of dark energy . in what follows",
    "we calculate the halo mass function for the de models considered in this paper .",
    "as our interests lie in finding the halo - mass of cdm matter in presence of thawing dark energy , we need to study the perturbation of matter inhomogeneity in order to calculate the linear density contrast at the time of collapse .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite and @xcite for some earlier works regarding spherical collapse formalism with dark energy models .",
    "we consider a spherical region of radius @xmath52 evolving in a cosmologically expanding background .",
    "the dynamics of this spherical region is essentially governed by the raychaudhuri equation , @xmath53   p\\label{eq : raychaudh}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the density of scalar field and the matter density inside the cluster respectively .",
    "it is easier to solve the equations after normalizing at the turn around point , so we define new variables : @xmath56 where the subscript @xmath17 denotes the turn around time .",

    "this is purely an assumption to simplify the analysis and is not necessarily true .",
    "but one should note that the @xmath68 is function of the background scale factor @xmath30 outside the cluster , but inside the cluster , it is a function of the radius @xmath52 of the spherical region .",
    "hence the actual behavior of the equation of state @xmath68 with time will be different inside and outside the over density , which is similar to the work by @xcite .",
    "[ c][c][1][0]*@xmath69 * [ c][c][1][0]*@xmath70 *     in addition , the linear density contrast @xmath71 obeys the equation : @xmath72 we calculate the linear over density @xmath73 at the epoch when the spherical region described by equation ( [ eq : raychaudh ] ) collapses to a point , @xmath74 by solving equation ( [ eq : lineardensity ] ) . here",
    "we assume that the virialization epoch is approximately twice of the turn around epoch .",
    "we should mention that this condition may get violated in some cases , like a dark energy model with phantom equation of state .",
    "but as we are considering here scalar field models , we never go to the phantom region of the equation of state .",
    "hence this relation still holds for our case . for the initial condition @xmath75",

    ", the abundance of cdm halos have been studied widely . theoretically , press and schetcher were the first to describe the abundance of these cdm halos as a function of their mass with the assumption that the fraction of the volume of the universe that has collapsed into objects of mass @xmath85 at a redshift @xmath86 follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "the comoving number density of clusters which have collapsed ( i.e. , virialized ) at certain redshift @xmath86 and have masses in the range @xmath87 can be expressed as : = -f((z ) ) [ dndm ] where @xmath88 is defined as mass function .",
    "the standard press - shechter mass function is of the form : f ( ; ps ) = .",
    "although it provides a good general representation of the observed distribution of clusters , due to the discrepancy of over - prediction ( under - prediction ) of the number of low ( high ) mass halos at the current epoch , @xcite introduced an ellipsoidal model of the collapse of perturbations .",
    "this sheth - tormen ( st ) mass function gives better fits to simulated mass function by reducing this discrepancy substantially .",
    "it has the form : f ( ; st ) = a ; it contains three parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 which we set into @xmath91 and @xmath92 for all the models we considered .",
    "the press - shechter case is recovered for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the accuracy of the st mass function has been found to be limited .",
    "in fact , recent high - quality n - body simulations have been used to find fitting functions which work far better than st mass function for varying dark energy models @xcite .",
    "however , we would keep working with the st mass function in this paper , keeping in mind that this may introduce @xmath95 errors in our calculations @xcite .",
    "since we are only studying the viability of using future surveys in distinguishing between dark energy models , this much error can be tolerated at this stage . in case one",

    "the cluster data that we have used , can not constrain @xmath2 .",

    "on the other hand , figure [ fig8:chis8 ] implies that although one can get a strong constraint on the parameter @xmath3 , it is not possible to constrain the form of the potential for the thawing models as the parameter @xmath127 is unconstrained .",
    "this is hardly surprising as we have already seen that the data on cluster counts can distinguish between thawing models mainly in the redshift range @xmath130 .",
    "however , the data set used in this analysis contains only three clusters in this redshift range . using the parameters appropriate for these observations",
    ", we find that the difference in the cluster counts for various models is of the order of a few , which is similar to the statistical uncertainties . in other words",

    "will be useful in constraining the models .",
    "to summarize , we investigate the cluster abundance in cosmological scenario where the universe is dominated by the thawing class of scalar dark energy .",
    "we consider both the ordinary scalar field with canonical kinetic term as well as tachyon field with dbi form of kinetic energy .",
    "moreover , we consider a variety of potentials that can give rise to suitable cosmological scenario different from concordance @xmath0cdm model . to study the formation of collapsed structures , we consider homogeneous dark energy as well as dark energy scenario where dark energy takes part in the virialisation process .",
    "we consider the press - schetcher formalism modified by @xcite to calculate the mass function .",
    "subsequently , we show that there exists significant difference in the number counts between different dark energy models and the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we also constrain our model using presently available observational data for cluster number counts .",
    "we show that although the present data is not suitable enough to distinguish thawing class of models , one can still get a reasonably strong constraint on the cosmological parameter @xmath3 as well as a lower bound on the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "given the fact that a large number of cluster surveys are currently ongoing as well as a number of future surveys are being planned , cluster number counts can be a smoking gun to distinguish different dark energy models from the @xmath0cdm .",
    "our present work is one preliminary step towards that direction .",
    "this work can be extended to freezing class of scalar field models as well as for models with non minimally coupled scalar fields .",
