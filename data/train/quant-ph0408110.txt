    "last two decades the phenomenon of squeezing , especially squeezed states in quantum optics attracted a lot of attention ( see , for example @xcite where the review of nonclassical states of light is presented ) . an important contribution to the theory of squeezed states",
    "was made by infeld and plebaski in studies @xcite , whose results were summarized in @xcite .",
    "plebaski introduced the following family of states , described by the vector : @xmath0 \\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{2}\\log a\\left(\\hat{x}\\hat{p}+\\hat{p}\\hat{x } \\right)\\right ] |\\psi\\rangle , \\label{plebst}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are position and momentum operators , respectively , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are real parameters , and @xmath6 is an arbitrary initial state . evidently , the first exponential in the right - hand side of ( [ plebst ] ) is the displacement operator written in terms of the hermitian quadrature operators .",
    "its properties were studied in @xcite .",
    "the second exponential is the special case of the squeezing operator ( see eq .",
    "( [ sq - op ] ) below ) .    for the initial vacuum state ,",
    "@xmath7 , the state @xmath8 ( [ plebst ] ) is exactly the squeezed state in modern terminology , whereas choosing other initial states one can obtain various generalized squeezed states .",
    "in particular , the choice @xmath9 results in the family of squeezed - number operator states , which were considered in @xcite .    in the case @xmath10 ( considered in @xcite ) , we arrive at the states known nowadays under the name `` displaced number states .",
    "'' plebaski gave the explicit expressions describing the time evolution of the state ( [ plebst ] ) for the harmonic oscillator with a constant frequency and proved the completeness of the set of `` displaced''-number operator states .",
    "infeld and plebaski @xcite performed a detailed study of the properties of the unitary operator @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a generic inhomogeneous quadratic form of the canonical operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 with constant @xmath15-number coefficients .",
    "stoler @xcite showed that the minimum - uncertainty states can be obtained from the oscillator ground state by means of the unitary operator depending on the complex number @xmath16 , creation @xmath17 and annihilation @xmath18 operators @xmath19 , \\label{sq - op}\\ ] ] which was later on named the `` squeezed operator . '' in the second paper of @xcite the operator @xmath20 was written for real @xmath16 in terms of the quadrature operators as @xmath21 $ ] , which is exactly the form given by plebaski @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which the minimum - uncertainty states preserve their form were studied , for example , in @xcite .",
    "plebaski squeezing operator can be also used to construct the specific scheme of measuring quantum states called squeeze tomography  @xcite .",
    "below we review this scheme and give a short description of other tomography methods .",
    "one of possible methods to create squeezed states is using time - dependent hamiltonians , e.g. , hamiltonian of parametric oscillator . the system with squeezing  @xcite and quantum damping  @xcite",
    "is also described by such hamiltonians .",
    "we will illustrate the squeezing phenomenon using the example of the damped oscillator .",
    "the quantum states are described either by wave functions  @xcite ( pure states ) or by density matrix  @xcite ( mixed states ) .",
    "the attempts to find a description of the quantum states which more closely resembles to the classical picture give rise to the quasidistribution functions in phase space of field quadratures as wigner function  @xcite , sudarshan  glauber @xmath22-function  @xcite , husimi @xmath23-function  @xcite .",
    "recently it was understood that the states can be associated with the standard probability distribution functions .",
    "this understanding emerged when the relation between the marginal distribution function for photon homodyne quadrature ( optical tomogram ) and wigner function was found  @xcite .",
    "optical tomography of quantum states was used to measure the quantum states of squeezed light  @xcite .",
    "the optical tomograms depending on a rotation angle parameter were generalized  @xcite to the case of symplectic tomograms of quantum states , which depend on a field quadrature and two additional real parameters .",
    "the symplectic and optical tomograms depend on random continuous variables ( homodyne quadrature components ) .",
    "there exists another tomographic scheme to measure the quantum states .",
    "this scheme uses probability distributions of discrete random variable @xmath24 , which has the physical meaning of number of photons  @xcite .",
    "another tomographic scheme is based on spin tomography  @xcite , where discrete random variable is the spin projection @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the aim of our paper is to discuss the new tomographic representation which we called squeeze tomography .",
    "the squeeze tomogram uses the discrete random variable @xmath27 , which is the photon number analogously to the case of photon - number tomography .",
    "the examples of the squeeze tomograms for the coherent states  @xcite , even and odd coherent states  @xcite , thermal states , and squeezed states  @xcite will be considered .",
    "squeezed states can be generated by the parametric excitation of oscillator . in the case of parametric oscillator , the hamiltonian is described by @xmath28 where we take @xmath29 . there",
    "exist the time - dependent constants of the motion which can be extracted from the noether s theorem considering variations along the classical trajectories  @xcite @xmath30 where the complex time - dependent function @xmath31 satisfy the classical equation of motion @xmath32 with initial conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which led to satisfy the commutation relation @xmath35 = 1 \\ .\\ ] ] we may find packet solutions of the schrdinger equation which are eigenstates of operator @xmath36 with complex eigenvalues @xmath37 .",
    "they have the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 variances of the position and momentum of parametric oscillator in these correlated coherent states can be calculated , and results are @xmath40 thus , for @xmath41 , the above states are squeezed states .",

    "schrdinger uncertainty relation @xmath43 then for cases where @xmath44 or @xmath45 are less than 1 , the squeezing phenomenum is present  @xcite .",
    "another example of squeezed states is related to the caldirola ",
    "kanai hamiltonian , which is used to describe dissipative systems .",
    "they introduced a system described by the lagrangian @xmath46 in this case , the equation of motion is @xmath47 the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath48 which can be quantized directly because it is quadratic in position and momentum operators .",
    "generally @xmath49 is used to be chosen .    in the same way as we did for the parametric oscillator",
    ", we can define generalized annihilation and creation operators for the quantum case through the relation @xmath50 where @xmath51 the generalized coherent wave functions are given by @xmath52 the time - dependent probability distribution in position representation can be rewritten as @xmath53    the statistical properties of these states are given by @xmath54 the dispersion and correlation satisfy the robertson  schrdinger uncertainty relation @xmath55 .",

    "these matrix elements ( tomograms ) have the physical meaning of photon distribution functions in the state described by the density operator @xmath80 . to measure the tomogram one has to take the initial photon state with density operator @xmath56 .",
