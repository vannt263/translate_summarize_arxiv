    "scattering theory in periodic structures has many important applications in diffractive optics @xcite , where the periodic structures are often named as gratings .",
    "the scattering problems have been studied extensively in periodic structures by many researchers for all the commonly encountered waves including the acoustic , electromagnetic , and elastic waves @xcite .",
    "the governing equations of these waves are known as the helmholtz equation , the maxwell equations , and the navier equation , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we consider the scattering of a time - harmonic elastic plane wave by a biperiodic rigid surface , which is also called a two - dimensional or crossed grating .",
    "the elastic wave scattering problems have received ever - increasing attention in both engineering and mathematical communities for their important applications in geophysics and seismology .",
    "the elastic wave motion is governed by the three - dimensional navier equation .",
    "a fundamental challenge of this problem is to truncate the unbounded physical domain into a bounded computational domain .",
    "an appropriate boundary condition is needed on the boundary of the truncated domain to avoid artificial wave reflection .",
    "we adopt the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) technique to handle this issue .",
    "the research on the pml technique has undergone a tremendous development since brenger proposed a pml for solving the time - dependent maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "the basis idea of the pml technique is to surround the domain of interest by a layer of finite thickness fictitious material which absorbs all the waves coming from inside the computational domain .",
    "when the waves reach the outer boundary of the pml region , their values are so small that the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed .",
    "various constructions of pml absorbing layers have been proposed and investigated for the acoustic and electromagnetic wave scattering problems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "combined with the pml technique , an effective adaptive finite element method was proposed in @xcite to solve the two - dimensional diffraction grating problem where the one - dimensional grating structure was considered . due to the competitive numerical performance , the method was quickly adopted to solve many other scattering problems including the obstacle scattering problems @xcite and the three - dimensional diffraction grating problem @xcite . however",
    ", the pml technique is much less studied for the elastic wave scattering problems @xcite , especially for the rigorous convergence analysis .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent study on convergence analysis of the elastic obstacle scattering problems .",
    "recently , we have proposed an adaptive finite element method combining with the pml technique to solve the elastic scattering problem in one - dimensional periodic structures @xcite . using the quasi - periodicity of the solution",
    ", we develop a transparent boundary condition and formulate the scattering problem equivalently into a boundary value problem in a bounded domain . following the complex coordinate stretching ,",
    "we study the truncated pml problem and show that it has a unique weak solution which converges exponentially to the solution of the original scattering problem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend our previous work on the one - dimensional periodic structures in @xcite to the two - dimensional biperiodic structures .",
    "we point out that the extension is nontrivial because the more complicated three - dimensional navier equation needs to be considered .",
    "the analysis is mathematically more sophisticated and the numerics is computationally more intense .",
    "this work presents an important application of the pml method for the scattering problem of the elastic wave equation .",
    "the elastic wave equation is complicated due to the coexistence of compressional and shear waves that have different wavenumbers . to take into account this feature , we introduce two potential functions , one scalar and one vector , to split the wave field into its compressional and shear parts via the helmholtz decomposition . as a consequence",
    ", the scalar potential function satisfies the helmholtz equation while the vector potential function satisfies the maxwell equation . using these two potential functions",
    ", we develop an exact transparent boundary condition to reduce the scattering problem from an open domain into a boundary value problem in a bounded domain .",
    "the energy conservation is proved for the propagating wave modes of the model problem and is used for verification of our numerical results .",
    "the well - posedness and exponential convergence of the solution are established for the truncated pml problem by developing a pml equivalent transparent boundary condition .",
    "the proofs rely on a careful study of the error between the two transparent boundary operators .",
    "two numerical examples are also included to demonstrate the competitive behavior of the proposed method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model problem of the elastic wave scattering by a biperiodic surface and formulate it into a boundary value problem by using a transparent boundary condition . in section 3 , we introduce the pml formulation and prove the well - posedness and convergence of the truncated pml problem . in section 4 , we discuss the numerical implementation of our numerical algorithm and present some numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method . the paper is concluded with some general remarks in section 5 .",
