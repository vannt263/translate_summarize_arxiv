    "as described in section 3.2 , @xmath97 is affected by the kaiser effect that enhances the clustering signal at all scales and by phot - z errors , that are modelled by using an exponential cut - off in the z - space power spectrum . for our sample of ccl",
    "agn the typical error on phot - zs is @xmath128=0.012@xmath129 = 0.052 at @xmath19=3.4 .",
    "this implies a cut - off scale @xmath107 = 43.45 h@xmath4mpc ( see equation 13 ) . including the phot - z damping in the modeling of @xmath97 , we derived the best - fit bias by using equation 14 and the @xmath122 minimization technique with 1 free parameter in the range s=1 - 50 h@xmath4mpc .",
    "in particular , for the z - space 2pcf measured using the generalized clustering estimator we derived b = 6.53@xmath130 . for the sample of 212 agn with known spec or best - fit phot - zs for which the classic clustering estimator is used , we derived b = 6.96@xmath42 .",
    "these values are in perfect agreement with the bias obtained from the projected 2pcf with @xmath3 = 200 h@xmath4mpc .",
    "this confirms that the convergence of the projected 2pcf observed only at large scales ( @xmath121200 h@xmath4mpc ) is due to large phot - z errors .",
    "in fact , for large redshift errors and small survey area it is necessary to integrate the correlation function up to large scales to fully correct for them .",
    "we also estimated the bias using the z - space 2pcf for 107 agn with known spec - zs .",
    "in general , we do not expect spec - zs to be affected by large errors .",
    "if we do not include the phot - z damping in the model of @xmath97 , we obtain for this sample a bias b = 5.86@xmath131 , which is lower than b = 7.5@xmath44 obtained using the projected 2pcf and @xmath3 = 200 h@xmath4mpc .",
    "a better fit of @xmath97 and a larger bias can be obtained only if we include in the model spec - z errors of the order of @xmath10 = 0.02 - 0.025 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath10 = 0.020 ( cut - off scale @xmath107 = 16.7 h@xmath4mpc ) and @xmath10 = 0.025 ( @xmath107 = 20.9 h@xmath4mpc ) , we derived b = 7.4@xmath132 and b = 8.01@xmath46 , respectively .",
    "however , given the low statistics , smaller values of @xmath10 and then of the bias can not be ruled - out . this error redshift is larger than what is expected for a spectroscopic sample of agn",
    "however , the presence in the spectroscopic sample of @xmath520% of the objects ( 21/107 ) with a low quality flag ( i.e. flag = 1.5 , corresponding to low quality spectra , and therefore not fully reliable redshift , but with known phot - z such that @xmath1330.1 ) could explain both the improvement of the fit including such an error in the analysis and the increase of the bias with increasing @xmath3 up to @xmath5200 h@xmath4mpc when using only agn with spectroscopic redshift .",
    "in this section we compare our results with previous measurements using cosmos agn at z@xmath53 and with previous studies at similar redshift .",
