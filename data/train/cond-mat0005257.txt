    "the mean - field phase diagram follows from the simple variational procedure for the functional  ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "it contains disordered , commensurate , and various stable  @xcite and metastable  @xcite periodic phases .",
    "the most important among the latter is almost sinusoidal , @xmath8 with weak higher harmonics  @xcite .",
    "although represented in terms of the one - component ( real ) order parameter , the periodic phases like  ( [ us ] ) are generally incommensurate with respect to the underlying lattice . from the other side ,",
    "it was stated  @xcite that incommensurate orderings , including those close to the commensurabilities of the ii class , should have to be represented by at least two quantities , i.e. , by the amplitude and the phase of some periodic modulation .",
    "this expectation originates from the experience with the i class of ic systems , characterized by at least two - dimensional order parameters .",
    "more specifically , the incommensurate orderings are then most often represented by the modulation of the phase of a complex order parameter . since the model  ( [ fe ] ) apparently does not comprise a phase variable , it was interpreted as a reduction , appropriate only for the description of the commensurate ordering , of some richer physical models that include at least two coupled modes , i.e. , one - component order parameters .",
    "the explicit landau model with this property was formulated by levanyuk and sannikov  @xcite , and widely explored afterwards  @xcite .",
    "the alternative approaches along same lines , attempting primarily to explain the phase diagram for betaine calcium chloride dihydrate ( bccd ) , were also proposed  @xcite .",
    "the physical arguments for such general approach to insulators from the ii class were given by heine and mcconnell  @xcite .",
    "coming back to the model  ( [ fe ] ) , it is important to emphasize that , either already bearing the whole physical relevance ( like in charge density wave materials  @xcite ) , or being derived from a more complex starting scheme  @xcite , it accounts for the cross - over between orderings with real and complex order parameters . in that sense the solutions like  ( [ us ] ) are examples of the mean field approximation for the latter .",
    "this can be most easily recognized by looking at the dispersion of the quadratic part of the expansion  ( [ fe ] ) in the reciprocal space , with the biquadratic ( `` bottle bottom '' ) dependence on the wave number ( see eq .  [ dis ] ) .",
    "this dispersion is an expansion around a pair of symmetry related minima , that in addition takes properly into account the symmetry condition on evenness with respect to the center ( or the boundary ) of the brillouin zone . in this sense",
    "the model  ( [ fe ] ) can be qualified as the basic one for the ii class , while the more complex landau expansions  @xcite are necessary in , physically possible , but non - generic cases when two or more hybridized modes are simultaneously close to instability .    in order to justify the above statement at the mean field level",
    ", one has to prove that incommensurate periodic states of the model  ( [ fe ] ) fulfill the crucial general property of incommensurately modulated orderings , namely that for each of them there exists a goldstone mode with the frequency @xmath9 that vanishes at @xmath10 , and generally has a finite slope ( phase velocity ) @xmath11 in the long wavelength limit @xmath12 .",
    "such mode should exist in the whole control parameter ( e.g. temperature ) range of ( meta)stability for a given state .",
    "it would correspond to standard acoustic phason branches for ic orderings in the materials of the i class .",
    "the existence of the goldstone mode in incommensurate states like  ( [ us ] ) for the materials of the ii class is to be contrasted to a widely accepted belief  @xcite that these states do not have a phason mode .",
    "the requirement @xmath13 guarantees the presence of translational degeneracy of the ordered state . in the particular case  ( [ fe ] ) this means that the periodic solutions should be invariant to translations @xmath14 with arbitrary @xmath15 .",
    "this is obviously fulfilled , since the kernel in the functional  ( [ fe ] ) does not depend explicitly on @xmath16 .",
    "it remains to find out whether there exists a goldstone mode with a _ nontrivial _ dispersion [ @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and , if so , to determine its properties at the critical lines of the phase diagram for the model  ( [ fe ] ) . with this aim ,",
    "we calculate in the present work the spectra of collective modes for all basic orderings that follow from the corresponding euler - lagrange equation . to this end",
    "we generalize the usual eigenvalue problem for collective modes to the systems with non - standard free energy densities , in particular to those like  ( [ fe ] ) with higher order terms in the gradient expansion . details of this method are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . combining analytic and numerical analysis",
    "we show that the goldstone modes for the incommensurate orderings like  ( [ us ] ) exist in the whole range of their stability .",
    "furthermore , it appears that collective modes of the model  ( [ fe ] ) have some peculiar , experimentally observable , properties . for illustration",
    "we discuss the contribution of collective modes to the dielectric response of the ii class materials for which the order parameter coincides with their electric polarization .    in sec .",

    "[ el ] resemble to that of @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , for all of them the phase velocities of goldstone modes vanish as the parameter @xmath37 tends towards both edges of metastability for a given solution  @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted to @xmath36 for @xmath32 , which remains finite at one edge , i.e. , at @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "the straightforward use of the above bloch basis  ( [ bloch ] ) leads to the dielectric susceptibility for the incommensurate state @xmath32 , expressed in terms of branches of collective modes . in the static limit which is under consideration here",

    "the expansion of @xmath50 in powers of @xmath27 does not contain the term linear in @xmath27 , i.e. , in the lowest order approximation it is given by @xmath51 the residual sum in eq .",
    "[ sci ] includes the contributions from massive collective modes , i.e. , those with finite gaps @xmath52 .",

    ", this coefficient vanishes together with the function @xmath58 at the transition to the disordered state ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "since @xmath36 remains constant , it becomes clear from the expression  ( [ sci ] ) that in this limit the finite contribution to @xmath56 comes from the residual sum . when calculated directly , by expanding the linear response equation in powers of @xmath60 , this contribution reads  @xcite @xmath61\\,\\,.\\,\\ , \\label{scp}\\ ] ] the previous calculations  @xcite were limited only to the leading term in this expansion .",
    "the careful inspection of the residual sum in  ( [ sci ] ) shows that it contributes to the susceptibility  ( [ scp ] ) only via one mode , denoted by @xmath62 in fig .  1 .",
    "we note that the oscillatory strength  ( [ ost ] ) of the lowest massive mode @xmath63 vanishes , so that it does not contribute to the susceptibility  ( [ sci ] ) .",
    "the mode @xmath62 `` survives '' the phase transition at @xmath45 , and remains the only contribution , presented by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "the dielectric susceptibility in the disordered state at @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 thus , at the phase transition from the incommensurate to the disordered state the dielectric susceptibility varies continuously , but with a finite jump in @xmath66 at @xmath44 .    to summarize the above discussion of the dielectric responses @xmath56 and @xmath67",
    ", we show in fig .  2 their dependence on the parameter @xmath68 ( i.e. on temperature ) .",
    "other parameters are fixed .",
    "2 also includes the susceptibility for the commensurate solution @xmath69 , which is stable in the ranges @xmath70 for @xmath33 , and @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "it is separated from the disordered state @xmath73 by the second order transition at the line @xmath74 , and from the incommensurate state @xmath32 by the first order transition , defined by the line @xmath75 .",
    "the static susceptibility of the commensurate state @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the dispersion for the corresponding unique collective mode that follows from eq .",
    "[ eta ] after inserting @xmath79 .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ scd ] ) and  ( [ scc ] ) that the static susceptibility shows a standard type of divergence at the line of the second order transition from the disordered to the commensurate state , @xmath74 . from the other side , @xmath80 has a finite value at the stability edge ( @xmath81 ) for @xmath76 in the regime of coexistence with the incommensurate state @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we propose an asymmetric behavior of the susceptibility as one passes through the hysteresis range ( in , e.g. , temperature ) , bounded by the values @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the parameter @xmath37 .",
    "namely , as shown in fig .  2 , by cooling through the incommensurate state one ends with the divergence of @xmath56 before passing into the commensurate state at @xmath83 , while by heating through the commensurate state one passes into the incommensurate state at @xmath82 with the jump in the susceptibility equal to @xmath84_{\\lambda = \\lambda_c}$ ] .    due to the existence of other metastable periodic solutions  @xcite in the above coexistence range of the parameter @xmath37 , the temperature variation of the susceptibility",
    "may be even more complicated than that schematically presented in fig .  2 .",
    "the more detailed analysis  @xcite shows that , provided that for a given material and in particular circumstances some of these states are stabilized , the static susceptibility will diverge at both edges of their stability ranges , again , like in the case of the state @xmath32 , due to the vanishing of phase velocity for the corresponding goldstone modes .",
    "since these stability ranges are rather narrow in comparison with @xmath85 , the stabilization of highly nonsinusoidal periodic states  @xcite would be manifested by dramatic variation of susceptibility in relatively short temperature intervals .",
    "in the above analysis it was clearly shown that the model  ( [ fe ] ) , although formulated in terms of a single and real order parameter , provides the existence of the acoustic goldstone mode for the incommensurate ordering . for small wave numbers ( @xmath86 )",
    "this mode simply generates compressions and dilatations of the sinusoidal modulation @xmath87 , i.e. , its physical content is same as that of standard phason mode for incommensurate orderings in the ii class of ic systems .",
    "amplitude fluctuations of this modulation are generated through higher , massive modes from fig .  1 .",
    "still , the lowest among these massive modes have some peculiar properties . for one of them",
    "the gap tends to zero by approaching the transition from , e.g. , the sinusoidal state to the disordered state .",
    "however this mode is not optically active .",
    "the whole optical activity at this transition comes from the another massive mode in order , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in contrast to standard approaches  @xcite , the dielectric functions for all ( meta)stable states are here strictly represented in terms of collective modes .",
    "we are thus able to distinguish modes with finite contributions in the optical response from those with no dipolar polarization .",
    "note that the present analysis of dielectric response is limited to systems with uniform commensurate orderings ( those with @xmath2 ) .",
    "the extension to systems with dimerizations , as well as the equivalent treatment of collective modes and dielectric response of extended landau models for ic systems of class i  @xcite , are under current investigations .",
    "the above analysis shows that incommensurate states that follow already from the simplest basic version of the model  ( [ fe ] ) for the ic systems of class ii , have the same physical properties as those of class i , represented in terms of the complex order parameter .",
    "this model is still insufficient for the explanation of rich phase diagrams of some well - known representatives of class ii , like thiourea and bccd . in this respect",
    "the question which remains is , how to make an appropriate extension without invoking an additional order parameter , in a way analogous to the recent proposal for the class i  @xcite , that would as well stabilize other commensurate states with wave numbers close to @xmath2 or @xmath88 .",
