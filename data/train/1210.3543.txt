    "during its development , human kind has transgressed various stages of fundamentally different ecological and technological characteristics . in line with dramatic population growth ,",
    "an increasing interaction with the biosphere and a domination of ecosystems took place . during the neolithic revolution , around 10,000bce",
    ", hunter - gatherer societies were progressively replaced by agrarian ones with far - reaching consequences such as the formation of settlements .",
    "the industrial revolution is considered as the most carving development affecting all areas of human life and coming along with the systematic exploration of fossil energy sources .    from an economic point of view , the increasing significance of services is understood as an additional level of development .",
    "in fact , agrarian , industrial , and service sectors are commonly denoted primary , secondary , and tertiary , respectively .",
    "however , the production forms do not completely replace each other but are complements and economies have more or less contributions from each sector .",
    "current theories and models on sectoral development are largely influenced by the work of clark , fisher , and fourastie who developed the ` three - sector hypothesis ' in the first half of the 20th century , describing development as a process of shifting economic activities from the primary via the secondary to the tertiary sector @xcite .",
    "their research was mainly based on observed historical shifts of workforce between sectors in today s more developed countries .",
    "further recently , approaches have concentrated on describing the relationship between shifts in sectoral labor allocation or gross domestic product ( gdp ) shares and economic development , often focusing on specific countries or regions @xcite . yet",
    ", the universality of the three - sector hypothesis has been challenged , since it does not well represent labor allocation in today s developing countries @xcite .",
    "different from the historical pathways of industrialized countries , shifts of labor force from the primary to the secondary sector have been relatively low .",
    "instead , advancement of the tertiary sector appears disproportionate early , which has been related to excessive urbanization and different structural conditions @xcite .",
    "while existing work has mainly focused on modeling patterns observed in the united states or in western europe , applying a similar analysis in a universal model does not exist to the best of our knowledge .",
    "furthermore , attention has mainly been given to sectoral resource allocation , e.g.  labor input , rather than to economic output , e.g.  the fractions of gdp .",
    "thus , the objective is to develop a parsimonious description of a countries sectoral composition of gdp , which is also able to capture the early advancement of the tertiary sector observed in developing countries .",
    "we consider a country @xmath0 and it s sectoral gdp composition , where the fractions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , correspond to the agricultural , industrial , and service sector contributions , respectively .",
    "the fractions of the three sectors add up to unity , @xmath4 .    with economic development , i.e.  increasing gdp / cap , the shares of the gdp shift between the sectors .",
    "we assume the transfer occurs according to a system of ordinary differential equations @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the @xmath7 of the gdp / cap ( the natural logarithm is used in order to compensate for the broad distribution of gdp / cap values ) and @xmath8 are country - specific parameters .    , industrial @xmath2 , and service @xmath3 ,",

    "a strong regionality can be observed and neighboring countries tend to belong to the same types .",
    "it is apparent that most developed countries belong to either type  1 or type  2 . at this stage",
    "it is not clear what the decisive factor is and further analysis including other economic data could help to pinpoint the most relevant influences of the countries economic paths .",

    "[ fig : collapse](a)-(c ) we plot the transformed data and separate the three most frequent types for better visibility into panels .",
    "the data generally collapses onto the unity diagonal , despite few countries where deviations are partly due to the fact that values before 1995 have been excluded from the fitting ( see above ) but the values are still displayed for completeness .",
    "the collapse suggests universality @xcite and supports the applicability of the proposed model .",
    "for the set of countries with reasonable fitting , some of the parameters are correlated non - linearly , i.e.  @xmath12 and @xmath14 as well as @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus , by introducing global parameters , the number of country - specific ones could be reduced .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is weakly correlated with @xmath6 , suggesting that  from the ensemble point of view",
    "( [ eq : sola ] ) has rather a log - normal shape , which indicates that the system is not ergodic .",
    "we would like to note that since @xmath6 is the logarithm of the gdp / cap , @xmath1 decreases as a power - law with the gdp / cap .",
    "studying the asymptotic behavior of the types as defined in tab .",
    "[ tab : types ] , it turns out , that types  1 and  2 converge to @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "the model is confined to specific ranges of @xmath6 , e.g.  @xmath80 for negative parameter @xmath14 .",
    "thus , it is important to keep in mind that fitting the model only characterizes the transfer as it is included in the data .",
    "this means , the obtained parameters only capture the behavior of the past .",
    "finally , @xmath71 is plotted versus the fraction of urban population for the year 2005 in fig .  [",
    "fig : collapse](d ) .",
    "the two quantities are correlated with a correlation coefficient of @xmath72 . despite not being completely linear ,",
    "the correlations are considerable , implying that low agrarian contribution to the economy s gdp comes along with less rural population . in order to visualize the relation to overall economic output",
    ", figure  [ fig : collapse](d ) also includes averages and standard deviations of those countries belonging to gdp / cap quartiles , i.e.  the quarter of all countries with highest gdp / cap , the second quarter of countries , etc . as one can see , with increasing gdp / cap , rurality and agrarian gdp share decrease . in other words ,",
    "a high degree of urbanization comes along with economic development or vice versa .",
    "this can be related to the finding that per capita socio - economic quantities such as wages , gdp , number of patents applied , and number of educational and research institutions increase by an approximate factor of @xmath81 with increasing city size @xcite .",
    "however , as timberlake @xcite has pointed out , in the case of developing countries an `` overurbanization '' with fast growing urban populations and excessive employment in the service sector can also hinder economic growth .",
    "not without reason most developing countries in our model belong to type  3 , where economic growth is associated with a sectoral transfer from service to industry .    in summary ,",
    "we propose a system of ordinary differential equations to characterize the development of the sectoral gdp composition . despite being very simple and involving only 4 country - specific parameters",
    "( @xmath12 has only the character of shift along @xmath6 ) , the model fits for the majority of the countries in the world .",
    "relating agrarian and industrial fractions , we collapse the data of all countries and all years onto a straight line .",
    "this could be used as an alternative approach to fit the parameters by means of non - linear techniques .",
    "we find that according to the parameter ranges , the countries belong to eight different types .",
    "most countries are found in three of them ; the members are distinct in geography and state of economic development .",
    "this suggests that countries with low current gdp / cap follow a different path from early developed countries .",
    "our results could indicate a relation between transfer patterns and economic development .",
    "further analysis of additional socio - economic data could shed light on reasons of economic failure or success .    as with any model ,",
    "our approach is a strong simplification of reality .",
    "also , we assume that parameters are fixed over time and countries follow a given development pathway .",
    "this may be justified by cultural , bio - climatic , and structural conditions , which have been consistent over the period of observation . on the other hand ,",
    "a transition between characteristic pathways is possible . for workforce distribution of 22 countries from the former soviet union and central as well as eastern europe",
    ", such a transition analysis has been performed using another simple model based on the three - sector hypothesis @xcite .",
    "a similar transition analysis could be an extension of the work presented .",
    "since it has been found that countries tend to develop goods which are similar to those they currently produce @xcite and that economically successful countries are extremely diversified @xcite , it could be also of interest , to extend the analysis to the level of products , in order to enable a more detailed analysis .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of a `` quaternary '' sector @xcite in our model might provide additional insights , but sufficient data is not ( yet ) available . in this context",
    "we would also like to note that many developing countries exhibit an informal service sector which is not included in the official figures .",
    "similarly , in developed countries the products can be very complex so that the separation between industrial and service sector might be fuzzy .",
    "accordingly , already the data analyzed in this study is likely to be affected by inaccuracies .",
