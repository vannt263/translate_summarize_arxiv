    "@xmath0-hypergeometric systems ( or gkz - systems or simply hypergeometric systems ) are systems of linear partial differential equations on the complex affine space @xmath5 . although they were already considered in works by j.  hrabowski @xcite and by i.  m.  gelfand , m.  i.  graev and a.  v.  zelevinsky @xcite , the systematic study of hypergeometric systems started with the paper by i.  m.  gelfand , m.  m.  kapranov and a.  v.  zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "each of these systems , denoted by @xmath6 , is determined by a pair @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an integer @xmath9 matrix of rank @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a parameter vector .",
    "an @xmath0-hypergeometric system @xmath12 is defined by the @xmath10 euler operators @xmath13 for @xmath14 and the toric operators @xmath15 associated with each pair @xmath16 such that @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 stands for the monomial differential operator @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    for generic parameters @xmath21 ,",
    "the holomorphic solutions of @xmath6 at nonsingular points can be described by using the so - called @xmath22hypergeometric series ( see @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite and subsection [ gevrey - solutions - at - infinity ] ) .",
    "we are interested in divergent @xmath22hypergeometric series solutions . to study them we use the notion of slopes defined in the general setting by y. laurent @xcite .",
    "if the matrix @xmath0 is pointed ( which means that the column vectors of @xmath23 lie in an open half - space with boundary passing through the origin in @xmath24 ) , m. schulze and u. walther @xcite have described the slopes of @xmath6 with respect to coordinates varieties , generalizing previous work in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these slopes are closely related to the irregularity of the system @xcite and the existence of non convergent gevrey series solutions of this system .",
    "gevrey series solutions of @xmath6 were studied by the second author in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite where the authors treat particular cases ) .",
    "modified hypergeometric systems were introduced by the fourth author @xcite in order to study solutions of hypergeometric systems along a curve @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "each of them is determined by a tuple @xmath28 where @xmath0 and @xmath29 are as before , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 ( or simply @xmath33 ) the matrix @xmath34 throughout this paper , we do not always assume that @xmath0 is pointed , but we assume that @xmath35 is . note that when @xmath0 is pointed , then @xmath35 also is .",

    "modified @xmath0-hypergeometric system _ : @xmath37 with @xmath38 running over all @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "here we denote @xmath41 .",
    "the modified system is defined on the space @xmath42 with coordinates @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) be the weyl algebra in @xmath46 .",
    "the left ideal in @xmath44 generated by the operators in ( [ eq : mgkz1 ] ) , ( [ eq : mgkz2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : mtoric ] ) is also denoted by @xmath36 if no confusion arises .",
    "the left @xmath44-module @xmath47 is denoted by @xmath48 . by @xcite",
    "the @xmath44-module @xmath48 is holonomic for any @xmath49 .",
    "the system @xmath6 is a summand of the modified system on the space @xmath50 .",
    "more precisely , denote @xmath51 with coordinates @xmath52 and consider the map @xmath53 defined by @xmath54 .",
    "the pullback image of the ideal @xmath36 by @xmath55 equals the ideal of differential operators on @xmath56 generated by @xmath6 and @xmath57 .",
    "notice that this last ideal is nothing but the hypergeometric ideal associated with the matrix @xmath58 and the parameter vector @xmath59 . as usual",
    "we denote this ideal by @xmath60 .",
    "let us consider the local analytic situation .",
    "let @xmath61 be the sheaf of holomorphic differential operators on @xmath62 and @xmath63 the quotient sheaf @xmath64 .",
    "by the previous observation , the hypergeometric @xmath61-module @xmath65 is the extension to @xmath66 of the pullback module @xmath67 considered as a @xmath68module on the first space @xmath69 . since @xmath55 is a biholomorphic map both @xmath70-modules @xmath71 and @xmath72 are isomorphic .",
    "we can describe solutions of the original hypergeometric system @xmath6 associated to the weight vector @xmath26 via solutions of the modified system .",
    "series solutions of @xmath6 have been studied in @xcite and @xcite where the authors constructed convergent series solutions associated to the regular triangulation induced by a generic weight vector @xmath4 .",
    "the construction is generalized as follows @xcite : assume that @xmath11 is very generic ( this condition is essential in the construction ) .",
    "suppose that the initial ideal @xmath73 has a solution of the form @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "then the monomial @xmath74 can be extended to a formal series solution @xmath76 of @xmath6 .",
    "we call the series @xmath77 a series solution of @xmath6 associated to the weight vector @xmath4",
    ". the series is divergent in general .",
    "we are interested in giving an explicit expression of a solution of @xmath6 whose asymptotic expansion is @xmath77 .",
    "a standard method , in the theory of ordinary differential equations , to construct such an expression is the laplace integral representation and the borel transformation of divergent series .",
    "this method has been successful in the study of global analytic properties of solutions of ordinary differential equations , see , e.g. , the book by w. balser @xcite and the references therein .",
    "then it is a natural problem to construct a laplace integral representation corresponding to the divergent series solution @xmath77 associated to the weight vector @xmath4 . our modified system , which is a system of differential equations for @xmath78 ,",
    "is used to give an answer to this problem .",
    "a key ingredient of our study is the fact that the modified hypergeometric system @xmath36 is transformed into the hypergeometric system @xmath79 associated with the matrix @xmath80 and parameter @xmath81 , by the formal inverse fourier transform @xmath82 , @xmath83 , which enables us to study the modified system using the theory of hypergeometric systems ( see subsection [ section - fourier ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath84 and @xmath85 the system @xmath6 is generated by @xmath86 .",
    "the modified system @xmath36 for @xmath87 , @xmath31 is generated by the three operators @xmath88 , and the inverse fourier transformation of @xmath36 is generated by @xmath89 which is equal to @xmath90 .",
    "we study the behavior of solutions of @xmath36 near the hyperplane @xmath91 in the space @xmath62 and we will give laplace integral representations of its solutions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ generalities - slopes ] we recall y. laurent s definition of the slopes of a finitely generated @xmath44-module with respect to a hypersurface .",
    "in section [ section - irregularity - gkz ] we recall the use of umbrellas for the description of the slopes of a hypergeometric system given by schulze and walther @xcite , then we summarize the construction of the gevrey solutions given in @xcite and extend some of these results to the case of the gevrey solutions at infinity .    in section [ section",
    ": irregularity - mgkz ] we prove that the formal inverse fourier transform , with respect to @xmath92 , of a modified hypergeometric system is an @xmath0-hypergeometric system and we use this fact to describe the slopes of the former by using the umbrella of the latter .",
    "we construct , associated with any slope of the modified system @xmath63 , a basis of its gevrey solutions , modulo convergent power series , when the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath93 are very generic , see theorem [ formal - modulo - convergent ] .",
    "moreover , for @xmath11 very generic we construct a basis of formal series solutions of the modified system for any @xmath94 and @xmath26 , see theorem [ theorem - dimension-1 ] .",
    "if in addition @xmath4 is generic this basis is reduced to a single element .",
    "later , in sections [ section : borel ] and [ section : borel_transform_revisited ] , we prove under some assumptions that this solution is an asymptotic expansion of a laplace integral representation of a solution by the borel summation method ( theorem [ borel - thm ] and section [ section : borel_transform_revisited ] ) . as an application , we give an asymptotic error evaluation of finite sums of formal series solutions of original @xmath0-hypergeometric systems with irregular singularities studied in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ( see theorem [ borel - thm ] , the inequality ( [ eq : asymptotic_expansion ] ) , and section [ section : borel_transform_revisited ] ) .",
    "example [ example12 ] illustrates the application for the simplest @xmath0 .",
    "several integral representations have been studied for solutions of regular holonomic hypergeometric systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they play a prominent role in the study of @xmath0-hypergeometric functions",
    ". however , there have been few studies of integral representations for solutions of irregular @xmath0-hypergeometric systems .",
    "we would like to point out that integral representations of holomorphic solutions of irregular @xmath0-hypergeometric systems have been recently given by a. esterov and k. takeuchi @xcite by using the so called rapid decay homology cycles .",
    "our laplace integral representation , which we propose in this paper for giving an analytic meaning to divergent series solutions , is different from their representation : the integrand of our representation is an @xmath0-hypergeometric function associated to a homogenized configuration of @xmath0 ( section [ section : borel ] ) .    in section [ section :",
    "borel_transform_revisited ] we illustrate how , under some conditions , the study of the irregularity of @xmath63 along @xmath92 gives an analytic meaning to the gevrey series solutions of @xmath95 , along coordinate varieties , constructed in @xcite .",
    "more precisely we prove ( see proposition [ bounded - growth ] ) that they are asymptotic expansions of certain holomorphic solutions of @xmath95 .",
    "an interplay of algebra ( slopes and formal series ) and analysis ( borel summation method ) is a main point of this paper . in order to make a comprehensible presentation to readers from several disciplines ,",
    "we often review some well - known facts to experts .",
