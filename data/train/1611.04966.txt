    "the study of the dynamics of qcd at finite temperature and density has been the subject of an intensive study , motivated by the heavy - ion experiments running e.g. at cern @xcite and rhic @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the lattice formulation has been one of the most promising frameworks which allows to investigate the properties of the non - perturbative regime of qcd at non - zero temperature . for pure su(3 ) yang - mills theory at finite temperature , a first - order transition is found at a critical temperature @xmath0 mev  see , for example , @xcite and references therein . for temperatures below @xmath1",
    ", the gluons are confined within color - singlets , whereas for @xmath2 the gluons become deconfined and behave as massive quasiparticles .",
    "the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition is the polyakov loop , defined on the lattice as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the time - oriented link .",
    "its space - averaged value @xmath5 is a measure of the free energy of a static quark .",
    "the behaviour of the polyakov loop as a function of the temperature is connected with a spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry .",
    "the wilson gauge action and the integration measure are invariant under a center transformation , where the temporal links on a hyperplane @xmath6 are multiplied by an element of the su(3 ) center group @xmath7 .",
    "under such a center transformation , the polyakov loop transforms as @xmath8 . for temperatures below @xmath1",
    ", the local phase of the polyakov loop is equally distributed among the three sectors , and therefore @xmath9 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath10 sectors are not equally populated ( a manifestation of a spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry ) and thus @xmath11 .    in this proceeding , we focus on several aspects of the landau gauge gluon propagator at finite temperature , computed via lattice qcd simulations . like other propagators of fundamental fields ( e.g. quark and ghost propagators ) ,",
    "gluon two - point functions encode information about non - perturbative phenomena , such as confinement and deconfinement .",
    "at finite temperature , the gluon propagator has the following tensor structure @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the transverse and longitudinal projectors respectively : @xmath15    [ lattsetup ]    cccccc temp .",

    "the temperature is defined by adjusting the lattice temporal size , @xmath19 .",
    "following our first reports @xcite , where we saw a measurable dependence of the gluon propagator at finite @xmath20 on the lattice volume , we have carefully chosen the lattice parameters of the various monte carlo simulations in order to keep the physical ( spatial ) volume at a constant value @xmath21 .",
    "simulations have been made in coimbra @xcite with the help of chroma @xcite and pfft @xcite libraries .",
    "the results shown here are for renormalized longitudinal and transverse propagators , and for a renormalization scale @xmath22gev . for details about the renormalization procedure",
    "see @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ plot3d ] we show how the propagators behave as functions of momentum and temperature . note the sharp transition for the longitudinal component at @xmath23 , and the turnover of the tranverse component in the infrared region , for @xmath24 .",
    "it is well known that a euclidean momentum - space propagator of a ( scalar ) physical degree of freedom @xmath25 oughts to have a klln - lehmann spectral representation @xmath26 where the spectral density @xmath27 contains information on the masses of physical states described by the operator @xmath28 . in @xcite",
    "a method is presented which allows to compute the spectral density of gluons and other ( un)physical degrees of freedom , for which the spectral density is not strictly positive .",
    "the method relies on tikhonov regularization combined with the morozov discrepancy principle .",
    "here we discuss some preliminary results @xcite for the spectral density associated to the gluon propagator at finite temperature , together with the temporal correlator @xmath29 note that @xmath30 in some range of @xmath31 implies a negative spectral density , hence positivity violation and gluon confinement . on the other hand , a positive @xmath32 says nothing about the sign of @xmath27 .    in fig .",
    "[ postrans ] we plot @xmath32 for the tranverse component . we conclude that the positivity is violated for all temperatures .",
    "furthermore , a careful inspection reveals that the time scale for positivity violation decreases with the temperature . in fig .",
    "[ speclong ] we plot , for a number of selected temperatures , the spectral density of the longitudinal component .",
    "the plots show that the momentum scale at which the spectral density becomes negative seems to increase with the temperature .",
    "all these results suggests that , for sufficiently high temperatures , the spectral density may be strictly positive and , therefore , gluons would behave as quasi - particles .",
    "in this section we investigate whether the gluon propagator at finite temperature behaves as a massive - type bosonic propagator @xcite .",
    "we consider a yukawa - type ansatz @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gluon mass and @xmath35 the overlap between the gluon state and the quasi - particle massive state .    the simplest definition for a gluon mass scale is given by @xmath36 .",
    "our results for a mass scale considering this definition can be seen in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ gmass ] . of course",
    ", a more realistic estimate for the gluon mass can be obtained by fitting our lattice data in the infrared region to the ansatz described in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) .",
    "it turned out that the lattice data for the transverse propagator is not compatible with such ansatz .",
    "the results for the longitudinal propagator can be seen in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ gmass ] .",
    "as seen in fig . [ plot3d ] , @xmath37 and @xmath38 show quite different behaviours with @xmath20 .",
    "the gluon propagator is usually computed such that @xmath39 i.e. in the so - called @xmath10 sector 0 . in this section",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the gluon propagator in the other @xmath40 @xmath10 sectors sector @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath42 , and the @xmath10 sector @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 . ] and compare with the results for the zero sector . to achieve such goal , for each configuration in a given ensemble , we applied a center transformation considering all @xmath45 , thus obtaining 3 different configurations related by @xmath10 transformations , with the very same value for the wilson action .",
    "each configuration is then rotated to the landau gauge .",
    "finally , each of the three gauge configurations is classified according to the phase of @xmath46 .    in fig .",
    "[ z3 - 324 ] , we can see the typical behaviour of the gluon propagator in the different @xmath10 sectors for a temperature well above @xmath1 . for the longitudinal component ,",
    "the propagator in the @xmath40 sectors is strongly enhanced relative to the @xmath47 sector . on the other hand ,",
    "the tranverse propagator in the @xmath40 sectors is suppressed if compared with the @xmath47 sector .",
    "however , for temperatures below @xmath1 , the picture changes  see fig .",
    "[ z3 - 269 ] . in this case , the three propagators for the different @xmath10 sectors are indistinguishable .",
    "a comparison of the markov chain history for temperatures below and above @xmath1  see fig .",
    "[ z3-mc ]  allows one to conclude that the difference of the longitudinal propagator between the different @xmath10 sectors can be used as a criterion to identify whether a given configuration is in the confined or deconfined phase .",
