    "we have discovered a 63  ms radio pulsar , psr  j1105@xmath06107 , during a recent search for pulsars using the 64  m radio telescope at parkes , nsw , australia .",
    "most pulsars with similar rotation periods fall into one of two categories : those that are young and energetic , the short spin period a result of a relatively recent birth , or those that have been mildly recycled by a binary companion , like the original binary pulsar , psr b1913 + 16 , which has a spin period of 59  ms .",
    "thus , a 63  ms radio pulsar is an important find , worthy of further investigation .    here",
    "we report on the discovery and follow - up timing observations of psr  j1105@xmath06107 , and show that it is a member of the first category above , namely young and energetic .",
    "pulsars are hypothesized to have been born in supernovae ; the existence of a young pulsar therefore requires us to consider whether there is an associated remnant of a supernova explosion . in the case of psr  j1105@xmath06107",
    ", we consider its possible association with the known remnant g290.1@xmath00.8   ( msh 11@xmath06_1_a ) which lies nearby on the sky .",
    "in addition , the existence of an energetic pulsar requires us to consider whether there should be associated high - energy emission , since magnetospheric x - ray and @xmath4-ray emission , generally representing a significant fraction of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity , very likely holds clues to the yet - elusive pulsar emission mechanism .",
    "we show that psr  j1105@xmath06107  should be detectable at high energies , and consider whether the known egret @xmath4-ray source 2eg j1103@xmath06106  is associated with the pulsar .",
    "psr  j1105@xmath06107  was discovered with the parkes telescope in 1994 july in a search at a central radio frequency of 1420  mhz .",
    "the search targeted ob runaway stars in the hope of detecting new pulsar / ob star binaries .",
    "psr  j1105@xmath06107  was discovered while pointing at the b4v star hd96264 , but the follow - up observations described below rule out any association .",
    "the details of the search will be described elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 96 timing observations of psr  j1105@xmath06107  were obtained between 1993 july 8 and 1996 july 4 at parkes . of these , 91 were obtained at central radio frequencies ranging from 1390 to 2050  mhz .",
    "the remaining five observations were obtained at 660  mhz in 1995 july .",
    "all data taken before 1995 were obtained using filter - bank timing systems ( 2 @xmath5 64 @xmath5 5  mhz at 1520  mhz and 2 @xmath5 256 @xmath5 0.125  mhz at 660  mhz ) that have been described in detail elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most data from after 1995 were obtained using the caltech correlator - based pulsar timing machine ( @xcite ) , which has @xmath6 lags across 128  mhz in each of two separate frequency bands .",
    "typically , correlator observations were made at central frequencies of 1420 and 1650  mhz simultaneously .",
    "compared to the filter - bank system , the correlator s narrower frequency channels resulted in less channel dispersion smearing and hence finer time resolution .",
    "filter - bank data were recorded on tape and folded off - line ; correlator data were folded on - line .",
    "average profiles were convolved with high signal - to - noise ratio templates to yield pulse arrival times .",
    "the average profile at 1650  mhz shown in figure  [ fig : prof ] was obtained by aligning and summing numerous individual correlator profiles .",
    "the profile at 1420  mhz is similar , while the two components obvious in figure  [ fig : prof ] can not be resolved in the 660 mhz data because of dispersion smearing .",
    "resulting arrival times were analyzed using the standard tempo pulsar timing software package ( @xcite ) together with the jpl  de200 ephemeris ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical arrival time uncertainties were @xmath1250  @xmath7s for @xmath110  min integrations with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath120 at frequencies above 1390  mhz .",
    "arrival times at 660  mhz had uncertainties approximately twice as large .    in the timing analysis ,",
    "the pulsar dispersion measure ( dm ) was first determined from delays across the observed bands and then refined using 15 arrival times measured in 1995 july , including all five measured at 660  mhz .",
    "this was to ensure good frequency coverage , and no contamination from long - term timing noise so common to young pulsars .",
    "the measured dm is ( @xmath8 )  pc  @xmath9 and during the subsequent timing analysis it was held fixed at this value . to minimize contamination of the timing position from long - term timing noise , we `` pre - whitened '' the data ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", fitting for sufficiently many frequency derivatives ( four ) to render the residuals approximately gaussian distributed , determined by eye .",
    "the timing position , determined while fitting for these derivatives , is given in table  [ ta : parms ] , and was subsequently held fixed . finally , we measured the best period and period derivative , also given in table  [ ta : parms ] .",
    "the uncertainties in all parameters are 1@xmath10 statistical uncertainties , obtained assuming equal weighting for all arrival times .",
    "the pulsar s surface magnetic field @xmath11  g , and its spin - down luminosity @xmath12  erg  s@xmath2 , where the neutron star moment of inertia @xmath13 is taken to be @xmath14  g  @xmath15 .",
    "the pulsar s characteristic age @xmath16  kyr .",
    "post - fit residuals , obtained after removing the timing model given in table  [ ta : parms ] , are shown in figure  [ fig : res ] . in the plot , uncertainties are typically much smaller than the size of the symbol .",
    "the timing noise , interpreted as irregularities in the neutron star s rotation , is obvious .",
    "we can quantify the amount of timing noise , as prescribed by arzoumanian et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , by measuring @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and for @xmath19  s. for psr  j1105@xmath06107  we find @xmath20 , which is consistent within the scatter with @xmath21 parameters for other young pulsars .",
    "the pulsar s small @xmath22 , as well as the large amount of timing noise , suggest that psr  j1105@xmath06107  is an excellent candidate for glitches .",
    "indeed we can not rule out some contamination of the timing parameters by a slowly - relaxing glitch that occurred before 1993 july ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) . that the timing observations for psr  j1105@xmath06107  reported here extend back a full year before the pulsar s discovery requires some explanation . in general , raw , dispersed , and unfolded",
    "filter - bank timing data are recorded and archived on tape . by chance ,",
    "psr  j1105@xmath06107  lies less than one parkes 1420  mhz primary beam - width from the pulsar psr j1103@xmath06101 , which was discovered in 1992 july , as part of a major search for pulsars near supernova remnants ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dm toward psr j1103@xmath06101 is only 75  pc  @xmath9 , indicating that it is a foreground object .",
    "once the discovery of psr  j1105@xmath06107  was made and its proximity to psr j1103@xmath06101 realized , the archived raw data for the latter were retrieved , dedispersed , and folded at the former s parameters.6107  was not detected as part of the kaspi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) search because it was outside the parkes search beam . only in 1993",
    "july was the correct timing position for psr j1103@xmath06101 determined .",
    "observations made after that date had the telescope pointing at psr j1103@xmath06101 s refined position , which was closer to that of psr  j1105@xmath06107 . ]",
    "psr  j1105@xmath06107  is located near the galactic supernova remnant g290.1@xmath00.8 , also known as msh 11@xmath06_1_a ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of a young pulsar to a supernova remnant suggests that they may have been formed in the same explosion .",
    "alternatively they may be coincidentally superposed on the sky ; the galactic plane is replete with pulsars and supernova remnants and the possibility of chance alignment is non - negligible . indeed a spurious association is not implausible , as the true remnant of the pulsar s birth may well have faded from view ( @xcite ) , and the explosion that produced g290.1@xmath00.8  may not have produced a neutron star .",
    "here we consider whether there is a genuine association between psr  j1105@xmath06107  and g290.1@xmath00.8 .",
    "the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) dm - distance model places psr  j1105@xmath06107  at a distance of 7  kpc , given its dm and galactic coordinates . the uncertainty on this distance is estimated to be @xmath125% .",
    "thus , the range consistent with the dm - distance model is 59  kpc . regions of enhanced free - electron density ( like h ii regions ) along the line - of - sight can result in an overestimate of the pulsar s distance from its dm .    the distance to g290.1@xmath00.8  has been estimated many times in the literature .",
    "first , hi absorption measurements made by dickel ( 1973 ) suggest that the remnant is probably at 34  kpc .",
    "the @xmath23 relation , which is known to be very uncertain , suggests a distance of 36  kpc ( clark & caswell 1976 ) .",
    "other authors have suggested that the remnant is more distant ( 1214  kpc ) , on the basis of its optical morphology and h@xmath24 to [ s ii ] ratio , which are more typical of older ( hence larger ) remnants like the monoceros ring ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , rho ( 1995 ) concluded from the neutral hydrogen absorption component of the remnant s x - ray spectrum ( see below ) that the distance is @xmath17  kpc , consistent with the pulsar distance , although this method has large uncertainties .",
    "independently , rosado et al .  ( 1997 ) argued that the remnant must be at @xmath17  kpc , on the basis of the kinematics of the optical emission , although they too concede that the estimate is uncertain given the complexity of the field .",
    "thus , overall , the estimated distances to the remnant are generally consistent with that of the pulsar within the substantial uncertainties ; an association is therefore plausible .",
    "the age @xmath25 of a radio pulsar is given by @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is its current spin period , @xmath28 is its spin period at birth , and @xmath29 is its braking index .",
    "the braking index @xmath29 is defined by the pulsar spin - down @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a positive constant that depends on the magnetic dipole moment and moment of inertia of the rotating neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath33 , and hence can be determined from timing observations in the absence of strong timing noise .",
    "the characteristic age is defined as @xmath34 , which assumes that @xmath35 ( true for a simple dipole ) and @xmath36 . for psr  j1105@xmath06107 , @xmath37  kyr .",
    "however , the short spin period for psr  j1105@xmath06107compared with other , younger pulsars ( e.g. psr b1509@xmath058 , @xmath38  kyr , @xmath39  ms ) suggests that @xmath36 does not necessarily hold in this case , and that the true age may be smaller .",
    "alternatively , if the braking index @xmath40 , as is the case for all pulsars for which it has been measured , then @xmath22 is an underestimate .",
    "notable is the recent measurement by lyne et al .",
    "( 1996b ) of @xmath41 for the vela pulsar .",
    "figure  [ fig : age ] shows how the true age of psr  j1105@xmath06107  depends on @xmath28 for four values of @xmath29 . for small @xmath28",
    ", the pulsar s age may be anywhere between 63 and 250  kyr .",
    "for @xmath42 , the pulsar s age must be smaller than 63  kyr , independent of @xmath29 .",
    "if we assume the pulsar was born with a spin period of @xmath43  ms , as for the crab pulsar , then @xmath44  kyr .",
    "age estimates for the remnant depend strongly on its distance .",
    "milne et al .  ( 1989 ) estimated the remnant to be only 2.2  kyr old , assuming the smallest distance estimate .",
    "rho ( 1995 ) suggests the remnant is somewhat older , @xmath110  kyr .",
    "the resemblance of the optical emission to that of the monoceros ring , whose age is @xmath45  kyr ( @xcite ) , suggests a much larger age for g290.1@xmath00.8 .",
    "if it is associated with psr  j1105@xmath06107 , the most likely range of true pulsar ages requires the remnant to have an age significantly larger than the milne et al .",
    "estimate , more in line with the more recently suggested hypotheses that it is at a greater distance .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr ] shows the location of the pulsar with respect to the remnant .",
    "it lies just over two remnant radii from the approximate remnant geometric center .",
    "its location , well outside the remnant boundaries , argues against an association ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , for a distance of 7  kpc , and assuming the age of the system to be 63  kyr , the transverse velocity of the pulsar , if it is associated with the remnant , is @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 , larger than the mean pulsar transverse velocity ( @xcite ) , but much less than has been suggested for pulsars in other proposed associations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and well within the range of measured pulsar velocities ( @xcite ) . thus , that the pulsar lies well outside the remnant does not necessarily rule out an association ; it would require the pulsar transverse velocity to exceed the mean remnant expansion velocity by more than a factor of two , not unreasonable if the remnant is expanding into a dense environment , as is suggested by its axisymmetric morphology .",
    "radio maps of the region closer to the pulsar show no evidence for any emission that might suggest another , closer supernova remnant , or a bow shock nebula ( a. green , personal communication ) .",
    "perhaps interestingly , the pulsar s inferred trajectory approximately bisects the remnant along its line of symmetry .",
    "seward ( 1990 ) and rho ( 1995 ) presented x - ray images of g290.1@xmath00.8  that show that the emission is centrally peaked .",
    "this is in contrast to the radio morphology which is more shell - like .",
    "this suggests that g290.1@xmath00.8  is like the supernova remnant w44 ( @xcite ) , which , like w28 and 3c400.2 ( @xcite ) , has centrally peaked x - ray emission but shell - like radio morphology .",
    "the central x - ray emission in these remnants is thermal .",
    "one possible interpretation is that the emission is due to the evaporation of dense cloudlets that survived the initial blast wave , rather than a central neutron star , as is the case for remnants with centrally peaked radio and non - thermal x - ray emission , such as the crab nebula . since the morphology suggests that this is also true of g290.1@xmath00.8 , there is no evidence for a central point source that would argue against an association with psr  j1105@xmath06107 .",
    "we note also that w44 , w28 , and 3c400.2 are relatively old remnants , all having estimated ages greater than 10  kyr .",
    "a measurement of the proper motion for psr  j1105@xmath06107  is highly desirable for determining whether it is associated with g290.1@xmath00.8 .",
    "if the association is real , the pulsar proper motion should be @xmath122  ( 63  kyr/@xmath25 )  mas  yr@xmath2 , independent of the distance .",
    "a timing proper motion will not be forthcoming , given the large amount of timing noise exhibited by the pulsar ( figure  [ fig : res ] ) .",
    "also , its low flux density ( see table  [ ta : parms ] ) will make interferometric observations using currently available telescopes difficult , although pulse gating may improve the feasibility .",
    "a measurement of the pulsar s scintillation speed through observations of its radio dynamic spectrum , a technique recently used by nicastro , johnston & koribalski ( 1996 ) to argue against an association between the radio pulsar psr  b1706@xmath044 and the supernova remnant g343.1@xmath02.3 , may provide some evidence against an association if a small speed is found . however , this will be difficult again because of the pulsar s low flux density .",
    "a large pulsar velocity away from the remnant could be confirmed by the presence of h@xmath24 emission from a bow shock nebula ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , although a lack of such emission could be due to an absence of ambient neutral hydrogen , and would not disprove an association .      at a distance of 7",
    "kpc , given its large spin - down luminosity ( table  [ ta : parms ] ) , psr  j1105@xmath06107  ranks 19th in a list of rotation - powered pulsars ordered by @xmath47 .",
    "six of the seven top spots are held by known @xmath4-ray pulsars ( the seventh being the millisecond pulsar psr j0437@xmath04715 ) , while most of the top 30 are known x - ray sources . on this list ,",
    "psr  j1105@xmath06107  ranks 15 spots higher than the known x - ray and @xmath4-ray pulsar psr  b1055@xmath052 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , psr  j1105@xmath06107is a good candidate to be an observable high - energy emitter .",
    "in fact , the radio timing position of psr  j1105@xmath06107  ( table  [ ta : parms ] ) lies well inside the 95% confidence @xmath48 error ellipse of the second egret catalog source 2eg j1103@xmath06106  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath4-ray source was referred to in the first egret catalog as gro  j1110@xmath060 ( @xcite ) , and is near , but outside , the error box of the second cos - b catalog source 2cg 288@xmath000 ( @xcite ) . reported @xmath49  mev fluxes of 2eg j1103@xmath06106  show no evidence for significant variability , consistent with its interpretation as a rotation - powered pulsar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the sources are associated , the estimated mean flux of 2eg j1103@xmath06106  suggests that psr  j1105@xmath06107  converts approximately 3% of its spin - down luminosity to high - energy @xmath4-rays for a beaming angle of 1.0  sr , comparable with the efficiencies of the vela pulsar and psr b1706@xmath044 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are 18 radio pulsars within 10@xmath50 of the galactic plane that have higher @xmath47 than psr b1055@xmath052 for which pulsations have not yet been detected by egret , omitting millisecond pulsars . with",
    "the discovery of psr  j1105@xmath06107 , four of these lie within the 99% confidence contours of unidentified egret sources .",
    "by contrast , of 268 known radio pulsars within 10@xmath50 of the galactic plane whose energetics should be below the egret threshold for detection , only two lie within the 99% confidence contours of unidentified egret sources ( @xcite ) . assuming that this control group is spatially distributed like the young pulsars , using poisson statistics , the probability for four coincidences among the 18 energetic pulsars is @xmath51 .",
    "even conservatively accounting for the possibility that the control group is less concentrated near the galactic plane ( for example , by assigning it a significantly larger mean z - height ) , we find that the probability for four coincidences must be under @xmath11% , although exact probabilities are difficult to estimate given the uncertainties in pulsar distances and spatial distributions , and in unidentified egret source properties .",
    "even so , the evidence argues strongly that at least three of the four coincidences of high @xmath47 pulsars with the unidentified egret sources are real .",
    "furthermore , yadigaroglu & romani ( 1997 ) showed that most of the unidentified low - latitude egret sources such as 2eg j1103@xmath06106  are likely to be young pulsars like psr  j1105@xmath06107 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the association between psr  j1105@xmath06107  and 2eg j1103@xmath06106is likely .",
    "however , only the detection of @xmath4-ray pulsations at the radio period will demonstrate the association unambiguously .",
    "several authors have argued that the @xmath4-ray source 2eg j1103@xmath06106 , as well as gro  j1110@xmath060 and 2cg 288@xmath000 , are associated with the carina complex , which includes the peculiar star @xmath52car , open clusters tr 16 , tr 14 , and several ob associations , with the @xmath4-rays being produced by cosmic ray interactions in the intercluster gas , or by @xmath52car itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the identification of 2eg j1103@xmath06106  with psr  j1105@xmath06107  does not necessarily preclude these interpretations , since 2eg j1103@xmath06106  may be a composite of several sources . indeed there is marginal evidence that its emission is extended ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of a luminous young pulsar near the @xmath4-ray source casts some doubts on alternative interpretations .",
    "sturner & dermer ( 1995 ) suggested that gro  j1110@xmath060 is associated with the supernova remnant g291.0@xmath00.1 ( msh  11@xmath06_2 _ ) , with the emission a result of cosmic ray interactions with the remnant . with the revisions made in the second egret catalog ,",
    "the source is now closer to the position of psr  j1105@xmath06107  and g290.1@xmath00.8 ; this and the discovery of psr  j1105@xmath06107  suggest that their proposed model is not relevant to this particular @xmath4-ray source .",
    "kaaret & cottam ( 1996 ) suggested that 2eg j1103@xmath06106  is a young pulsar associated with the ob association car 2 .",
    "the measured distance to the association is 2.2  kpc ( @xcite ) , which is inconsistent with the dm - derived distance of 7  kpc for psr  j1105@xmath06107 , suggesting that the association lies in the foreground .",
    "if the pulsar actually is in the cluster , its association with g290.1@xmath00.8  is doubtful because the remnant dimensions would suggest that it is much younger than the pulsar , and it would be hard to understand the pulsar s position so far outside the remnant since the latter would have had less time to decelerate . in this case , the pulsar should be a bright x - ray source , with x - ray luminosity @xmath53  erg  s@xmath2  @xmath54 ( @xcite ) , and should be easily detected by x - ray satellites such as _",
    "we have reported the discovery and follow - up timing observations of psr  j1105@xmath06107  which show it to be young and energetic .",
    "we have considered its proximity to the supernova remnant g290.1@xmath00.8  and show that an association between the two is possible , and could be confirmed or disproved by proper - motion measurements .",
    "we have also considered a possible association of psr  j1105@xmath06107  with the egret source 2eg j1103@xmath06106  and conclude that it is likely .",
    "it is remarkable that this interesting pulsar was found serendipitously in a search unrelated to either egret sources or supernova remnants , while recent targeted searches of both have been done but have met very limited success .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . that psr  j1105@xmath06107  was missed by a survey including",
    "g290.1@xmath00.8  is not surprising given the pulsar s low flux density and large angular displacement from the remnant .",
    "if the association between psr  j1105@xmath06107  and g290.1@xmath00.8  is one day proven , it , and other plausible pulsar / snr associations in which the pulsar lies outside the remnant boundaries ( see @xcite for a review ) , would argue strongly that care must be taken to search a large area around the remnant , not just inside .",
    "either way , the discovery of psr  j1105@xmath06107  suggests that deeper searches of the error boxes of unidentified egret sources for radio pulsars are warranted .",

    "<S> given its estimated distance , psr  j1105@xmath06107  is therefore likely to be observable at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is coincident with the known cgro / egret source 2eg j1103@xmath06106 ; we consider the possible association and conclude that it is likely . </S>"
