    "skeletal striated muscles are tissues that contract in order to produce the movement of the body .",
    "the fundamental contractile unit of the muscle is the _ sarcomere _ which is composed of two types of filaments , actin and myosin , in an arrangement that allows them to slide past each other @xcite . upon nervous stimulation ,",
    "@xmath0 ions flow into the muscle cell and expose binding sites located on the actin filament @xcite .",
    "the myosin thick filament consists of myosin ii motor proteins with a lever arm structure that bind to the binding sites on the actin thin filament and , via atp hydrolysis , change its conformation , resulting in a `` power stroke '' that propels the myosin filament on top of the actin filament @xcite .",
    "comparison of skeletal muscle cells in different vertebrates reveals that the lengths of their sarcomeres are almost identical .",
    "the length of the thick filament is usually found to be close to 1.6 @xmath1 m , while the length of the thin filament is typically in the @xmath2 @xmath1 m range @xcite .",
    "this fact is striking considering the different tasks that different muscles perform in different species . here , we argue that this remarkable feature of muscles is closely related to the ability of the myosin ii motors to work in cooperation , which may be jeopardized by the elasticity - mediated crosstalk ( emc ) effect arising from the compliance of the actin filament @xcite . during muscle contraction , the application of opposite forces ( the motor forces vs.  the external load ) on the actin filaments causes large force fluctuations .",
    "this leads to an increase in the elastic energy stored in the filaments that can be lowered if the the duty ratios of the myosin ii motors are changed .",
    "our analysis shows that , in contracting muscles , the emc effect causes the attachment probability of motors to become non - uniform ( spatially dependent ) .",
    "this feature negatively affect muscle performance since it hampers the ability of the motors to cooperate efficiently .",
    "interestingly this undesired phenomenon becomes significant only when the system size exceeds that of the sarcomere , which provides a plausible explanation for the similarity of the sarcomeres in muscle cells across vertebrates .",
    "our current understanding of the mechanics of muscle contraction is very much influenced by two classical works .",
    "the first one is a.  v.  hill s work ( 1938 ) @xcite , in which the muscle was represented through a combination of elastic , contractile , and resistive ( viscous ) elements .",
    "hill postulated that in overcoming the viscous resistance , the contracting muscle does work and produces heat . through a general notion of energy balance and some empirical relations between the rate of heat production during muscle contraction and the contraction velocity , hill derived his famous equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the load opposing the contraction ,",
    "@xmath5 is the contraction velocity , @xmath6 is the isometric load ( i.e. , the load for @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants . although generally considered as a phenomenological force - velocity relationship rather than a thermo - mechanical expression , hill s equation has drawn much attention because of its simplicity and the agreement it shows with experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "the second seminal work is huxley s crossbridge theory from 1957 that provides a molecular - level interpretation for muscle contraction @xcite . within the model ,",
    "the myosin motor heads interact with specific binding sites along the actin filament to form elastic crossbridges .",
    "when a motor is attached to a binding site , the crossbridge stretches and force is applied on the actin filament , resulting in the relative movement of the actin ( thin ) and myosin ( thick ) filaments past each other .",
    "the attachment and detachment of motor heads to and from the actin filament are governed by `` on '' and `` off '' rate functions that regulate the fraction of crossbridges ( i.e. , attached motors ) , and which depend on the stretching energy of the crossbridges .",
    "the `` on '' and `` off '' rates were chosen by huxley to obtain a good fit with hill s experimental data for the force - velocity relationship [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : hill ] ) ] .",
    "huxley s work , together with the development of improved methods for experimental determination of the sarcomere s micro - structure @xcite , as well as new biochemical measurements of atp activity @xcite , have provided a fruitful field for further investigations . in 1971 ,",
    "a widely accepted four - state scheme for the mechanochemical cycle of myosin ii has been introduced by lymn and taylor @xcite .",
    "more recently duke @xcite , and later others @xcite , have come up with models that integrated the lymn - taylor scheme into the crossbridge model .",
    "duke s model ( like huxley s ) treats the motor heads as elastic elements with strain - dependent on and off rates .",
    "the model assumes that the viscous friction forces can be neglected in the equation of motion of the contracting muscle .",
    "the latter assumption remains controversial , and several alternative models incorporating viscous effects have been also proposed for the contractile process @xcite .",
    "both classes of models have been successful in producing hill s force - velocity relationship .",
    "another major success of the theoretical models is their ability to show that the fraction of working ( force - producing ) motors , @xmath10 , increases with the load @xmath4 .",
    "this feature has been recently observed by lombardi and co - workers @xcite who showed , by using x - ray scattering and mechanical measurements on tibialis anterior muscles of frogs , that @xmath10 increases from roughly @xmath11 for @xmath12 to @xmath13 for the maximal isometric load .",
    "related patterns of collective behavior also emerge in models for motor protein motility assays @xcite .",
    "specifically , several ratchet models have shown that when two groups of antagonistic motors are engaged in a `` tug - of - war '' competition , their detachment rates may be considerably varied @xcite .",
    "another setup , closely related to muscle contractility , is a single class of motors that work against the force produced by an optical trap @xcite .",
    "one of the factors that significantly alters the detachment rates is the elasticity - mediated crosstalk ( emc ) , whose effect on muscle contractility is studied here using a simple spring - bead model .",
    "before presenting our model and its results , we first wish to examine more closely the experimental results of ref .  @xcite . to this end , it is useful to define the dimensionless variables @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the maximum contraction velocity at @xmath12 . when expressed in terms of these variables , hill s equation ( [ eq : hill ] ) takes the dimensionless form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hill2 ] ) satisfies both the relation that @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( load - free contraction ) and @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( isometric contraction ) .",
    "the other important notion in relation to muscle contraction is the observed ( see fig .",
    "3(d ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) increase in @xmath10 with @xmath4 , which is well approximated by the linear relationship @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the attachment probability for @xmath20 and @xmath22 , respectively . to match the experimental data , we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "since the sarcomere contracts at a constant velocity , then newton s first law of motion implies that the forces generated by the motors are balanced by the external load @xmath4 and the friction forces in system .",
    "the latter originate from two sources : the surrounding medium and the crossbridges .",
    "the balance of forces reads @xmath28 the expression in brackets on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton ] ) can be identified as the force per motor @xmath29 it includes a positive `` active force '' , @xmath30 , and a negative `` motor - friction force '' characterized by the motor friction coefficient @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this linear force - velocity relationship is consistent with the experimental results shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : newton ] ) we have the counter external load , @xmath32 , and the friction force caused by the surrounding medium , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , both normalized per motor .",

    "( [ eq : hill2 ] ) with @xmath39 we further note that for @xmath19 ( @xmath40 ) , the following expression can be derived for @xmath41 if eq .",

    "( [ eq : f_vmax ] ) , yields @xmath45 . when this last result , together with the values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) , one arrives to @xmath46 , which is within the range @xmath47 where the constant @xmath18 is typically found for skeletal muscles @xcite .",
    "notice that in order to match the experimental data , we included viscous terms in our derivation , which ( as noted above ) is a matter of controversy . nevertheless , it is important to recognize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) has a well defined limit when both @xmath48 and @xmath31 vanish , provided that @xmath49 is finite .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the relevance of the emc effect to skeletal muscle contraction . fig .  [",
    "fig : sarcomere](a ) shows a schematics of the sarcomere structure , consisting of an array of parallel actin thin filaments surrounded by thick filaments of myosin motors .",
    "adjacent sarcomeres are connected end - to - end to form _",
    "myofibrils_. the ends of the actin filaments are anchored at the _ z - line _ , which transmits the external load to the actin filaments .",
    "our model of the sarcomere is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sarcomere](b ) .",
    "the elastic actin filament is modeled as a chain of @xmath50 monomers connected by @xmath51 elastic springs with spring constant @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that a motor exerts a force of magnitude @xmath41 on the actin filament in the attached state , and no force in the detached state .",
    "the other model parameter is the attachment probability of the motors , @xmath10 . as discussed above ,",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath10 vary with @xmath5 .",
    "our model neglects spatial ( motor - to - motor ) and temporal variations of @xmath10 and @xmath41 _ at a given _ @xmath5 , so these two quantities represent the typical attachment probability and motor force , respectively .",
    "as we will demonstrate below , it is the emc effect that leads to spatial variations in the _ effective _ ( mean ) attachment probability of the motors , which we will denote by @xmath53 ( to be distinguished from the uniform `` bare '' attachment probability  @xmath10 ) .",
    "the motor forces work against the opposite external force which is applied on the @xmath50-th last monomer",
    ". the tug - of - war competition between the motor forces and the external force stretches the actin filament . denoting by @xmath54 the elastic energy of the filament ,",
    "the statistical weight of a configuration with @xmath55 connected motors is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the thermal energy .",
    "we treat the elastic energy as an equilibrium degree of freedom ( of a system which is inherently out - of - equilibrium ) because the mechanical response of the filament to the attachment or detachment of motors is extremely rapid and occurs on time scales which are far shorter than the typical attachment time of the motors .",
    "the elastic energy @xmath54 is calculated as follows @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath58 the force applied on the @xmath59-th monomer , where @xmath60 or @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and , @xmath63 or @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the total elastic energy is the sum of spring energies , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the force applied on the @xmath59-th spring .",
    "the forces @xmath67 are calculated as follows : we first calculate the mean force @xmath68 , and define the excess forces acting on the nodes : @xmath69 .",
    "the force on the @xmath59-th spring is then obtained by summing the excess forces applied on all the monomers located on one side of the spring : @xmath70 .",
    "the model is studied by using monte carlo simulations with trial moves that attempt to change the state ( connected or disconnected ) of a randomly chosen motors . for each move attempt ,",
    "the elastic energy @xmath54 of the chain is recalculated , and the move is accepted or rejected according to the conventional metropolis criterion with the statistical weights given by @xmath71 .",
    "in half sarcomere , each thick filament has about 150 motor heads @xcite . to simulate muscles operating under conditions of optimal force generation",
    ", we assume that there is a full overlap between the thick and thin filaments @xcite , and consider a chain with @xmath72 monomers .",
    "( the division by @xmath73 is due to the 1:2 ratio between thin and thick filaments ) we also simulate larger systems of @xmath74 and @xmath75 nodes and fix the model parameters to @xmath11 , @xmath76 pn , and @xmath77 n / m ( see discussion on how these values were set in @xcite ) .",
    "our simulation results for the mean attachment probability , @xmath78 , as a function of @xmath59 ( @xmath79 ) , the position of the monomer along the chain , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_i ] for @xmath80 ( a ) , @xmath74 ( b ) , and @xmath75 ( c ) .",
    "the simulations reveal that due to the emc effect , the attachment probability becomes a monotonically increasing function of @xmath59 .",
    "the origin of this feature is the fact that the springs are not equally stretched , as can be inferred from the above derivation of the elastic energy .",
    "generally speaking , attachment of a motor to a certain node @xmath59 leads to a reduction in the energy of the springs with @xmath81 . for each @xmath50",
    ", there is a single node ( @xmath82 ) where the attachment probability , @xmath83 , is independent of @xmath4 and takes a value which is very close to the bare attachment probability @xmath10 .",
    "the difference between the attachment probabilities at both ends of the chain ( i.e. , for @xmath84 and @xmath65 ) increases with both @xmath50 and @xmath4 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the variation in @xmath85 is quite small , becoming meaningful only at near - stall forces @xmath86 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath74 , the variations in @xmath78 are significant and may be as large as @xmath87 .",

    "this is not the case for @xmath75 , where @xmath53 exhibits a steady increase with @xmath4 .",
    "the increase in @xmath53 is due to the fact that at large forces ( notice that the applied loads are proportional to @xmath50 ) , the attachment probability @xmath78 becomes a rapidly increasing function of @xmath59 .",
    "the implication of the rise in @xmath92 is that the stall force _ per motor _ increases to @xmath93 ( from @xmath94 for @xmath80 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "the above results seem to indicate that for @xmath95 , the variations in @xmath78 may be sufficient to disrupt muscle performance .",
    "however , one needs to recall that the simulation results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_i ] correspond to fixed values of @xmath10 and @xmath41 , while in reality the values of these quantities vary with the shortening velocity @xmath5 . therefore , we also performed simulations where for each value of @xmath4 , the appropriate value of @xmath5 is chosen and , accordingly , the values of @xmath10 and @xmath41 are set .",
    "this has been done by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hill2 ] ) , ( [ eq : linear_r ] ) , and ( [ eq : linear_f ] ) , as outlined in appendix [ append ] .",

    "similarly to the results plotted in the above fig .",
    "[ fig : r_i](a ) , the results here indicate that @xmath85 remains fairly uniform for @xmath96 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the motor mechanochemistry , where at high and medium velocities @xmath5 the detachment of motors occurs after the completion of the power stroke . in the mechnochemical picture ,",
    "the detachment rate can be estimated by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the size of the power stroke ( @xmath99 nm @xcite ) , and this rate must be the same for all the motors . highly polarized detachment probability hampers the motors ability to cooperate and , thus , constitutes an undesired effect .",
    "notice that fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] features a small increase in the attachment rate near the z - line ( for @xmath100 ) .",
    "this , in fact , represents a `` positive '' effect , as it enables the muscle to sustain a larger load .",
    "we stress that the discussion here is relevant only for high and medium velocities where the motors attach , execute the power stroke , and then unbind . at very low velocities ( @xmath101 ) close to the isometric load ( @xmath102 ) , the motors may detach and reattach multiple times before the power stroke is completed @xcite .",
    "the number of attachments per power stroke need not be the same for all the motors and , therefore , variations in the attachment probabilities ( which are indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] at small values of @xmath103 ) can be tolerated in this limit without negative consequences for muscle contractility .",
    "we found that the emc effect leads to an increase in the attachment probability ( duty ratio ) of motors located near the z - line while , simultaneously , decreasing the attachment probability of the motors in the central part of the sarcomere ( m - line ) .",
    "the resulting variations in the attachment probabilities of the motors pose a serious problem for muscle performance because the detachment rate of the motors is primarily determined by the size of the power stroke and the muscle shortening velocity and , therefore , should be fairly uniform .",
    "we used a simple bead - spring model to demonstrate that this undesired effect can be almost neglected for half - sarcomeres consisting of less than approximately @xmath104 motors , which is precisely the `` universal '' size of half a sarcomere .",
    "recent advances in single molecule techniques @xcite open the opportunity for testing our theoretical predictions concerning the polarization of the attachment probability . specifically",

    "( [ eq : linear_f ] ) @xmath107}. \\label{eq : f0}\\ ] ] the determination of @xmath10 is slightly more complicated .",
    "the complication arises due to the fact that the bare attachment probability @xmath10 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : linear_r ] ) and ( [ eq : newton ] ) should be replaced with the effective attachment probability , @xmath53 , which is the experimentally measured quantity and which is not known a - priori .",
    "therefore , for each value of @xmath103 we simulated different values of @xmath10 and , using linear interpolation , determined the value of @xmath10 that yields the desired @xmath53 .",
    "as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath53 is quite small for high and medium velocities .",
    "another important comment is the following : if the excess forces used in the calculation of the elastic energy are expressed in units of the motor force @xmath41 , @xmath108 , then the boltzmann weight of a configuration with @xmath55 connected motors can be written as @xmath109 where @xmath110 . in the simulations presented in fig .",
