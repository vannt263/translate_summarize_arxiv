    "in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , @xmath8 and @xmath1 decays to light hadrons are expected to be dominated by the annihilation of @xmath9 quarks into three gluons or one virtual photon , with hadron decay partial widths that are proportional to the square of the @xmath9 wave function overlaps at the origin , which can be related to their leptonic decay widths @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ratio @xmath10 of branching fractions for @xmath1 and @xmath8 decays to the same final state should follow the rule : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes a branching fraction and @xmath13 is a particular hadronic final state .",
    "this relation is referred to as the  12% rule \" .",
    "although the 12% rule works well for some specific decay modes of the @xmath1 , the decay @xmath1 to @xmath14 exhibits a factor of 70 times stronger suppression than expectations based on this rule .",
    "this suppression in vector - pseudoscalar ( vp ) meson modes was first observed by markii @xcite , which is referred to as the  @xmath15 puzzle \" .",
    "further tests of this rule in the vp modes have been performed by cleo @xcite and besii @xcite , and have been extended to the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar meson ( pp ) , vector - tensor meson ( vt ) and multibody decays . although @xmath10 values have been measured for a wide variety of final states , most of them have large uncertainties due to low statistics @xcite .",
    "reviews of the rho - pi puzzle conclude that current theoretical explanations are unsatisfactory @xcite .",
    "more experimental results are desirable",
    ".    for charmonium @xmath16 decays to light hadrons @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the asymptotic behavior of the branching fraction from a pqcd calculation to leading twist accuracy gives @xcite : @xmath19\\sim \\left({\\lambda^2_\\textrm{qcd } \\over m_c^2 } \\right)^{|\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2|+2},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the helicities of the corresponding hadrons . here",
    "@xmath22 is the charm quark mass and @xmath23 is the qcd energy scale factor .",
    "if the light quark masses are neglected , the vector - gluon coupling conserves quark helicity and this leads to the helicity selection rule ( hsr ) @xcite : @xmath24 .",
    "if the helicity configurations do not satisfy this relation , the branching fraction should be suppressed .",
    "for the @xmath1 decays to vp [ @xmath25 or tp [ @xmath26 , the amplitudes are antisymmetric in terms of the final state helicities , since strong or electromagnetic interactions conserve parity .",
    "hence the amplitudes vanish when @xmath27 .",
    "nonvanishing amplitudes require the helicity configuration to satisfy the relation @xmath28 , which violates the hsr and the branching fractions are expected to be suppressed .",
    "strikingly , hsr - violating decays were recently observed in @xmath29 decays into vector - vector meson pairs by besiii @xcite , which strongly indicates the failure of the hsr @xcite . in an analysis of @xmath30 by besii  @xcite , evidence for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 refers to either @xmath33 or @xmath34 )",
    "was seen , but low statistics prevented a further study .    with the large @xmath1 data sample accumulated by the besiii experiment , new opportunities to precisely test the @xmath35 rule in the decays of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and to search for @xmath38 are available .",
    "such measurements can shed light on charmonium decay mechanisms and , therefore , be helpful for understanding the @xmath14 puzzle",
    ". in particular , the decay @xmath39 provides opportunities to study not only @xmath40 , but also the excited @xmath41 states , such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the decay @xmath44 also allows us to study the isospin violation decay @xmath45 , which is expected to proceed via electromagnetic ( em ) processes @xcite .",
