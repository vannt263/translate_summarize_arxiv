    "over the past two decades , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have constituted a pristine platform which has enabled numerous theoretical and experimental investigations ; see e.g.  @xcite . within this realm",
    ", the theme of nonlinear waves has received a significant amount of interest due to the wide tunability and range of possibilities available in the ever expanding number of experimental setups ; see e.g. for recent reviews  @xcite . in parallel , significant developments in the field of ( discrete , as well as continuum ) nonlinear optics",
    "@xcite have offered a complementary thrust especially in the study of solitary waves and their dynamics and interactions in such dispersive media .",
    "one of the particularly intriguing dynamical structures that was mathematically proposed  @xcite and experimentally realized  @xcite originally in optical systems , but which has garnered considerable recent interest in atomic becs consists of the dark - bright ( db ) solitary waves .",
    "the wide range of theoretical  @xcite and also of experimental  @xcite studies on this theme is , arguably , warranted by the special nature of this structure .",
    "more specifically , while bright solitons can not exist `` on their own '' in the repulsive inter - atomic interaction setting where dbs arise , the dark solitary waves play the role of an effective potential that enables the bound state trapping of the bright component .",
    "the result of this symbiosis is a robust db structure which has been experimentally monitored , e.g. , to oscillate with the customary harmonic confinement  @xcite , to be spontaneously produced by counterflow experiments  @xcite , and to form bound states  @xcite .",
    "additionally , su@xmath0-rotated variants of the db solitons have also been experimentally observed assuming the form of beating dark - dark solitons  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that two - dimensional generalizations of the db solitary waves have also been explored in the context of the so - called vortex - bright ( vb ) solitary waves  @xcite and have been observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "pairs of such vb states have also been recently considered  @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to connect this setup of the db solitary waves ( and especially of the bound states of their pairs ) with another notion that has been extensively explored in atomic becs , as well as in optics , namely that of the double well potential ( dwp ) .",
    "the prototypical realization of the latter in the context of bec relies on the combination of a parabolic trap with a periodic potential .",
    "the latter can be created in the form of an optical lattice , by the interference of laser beams illuminating the condensate  @xcite .",
    "the use of a dwp created as a trap for bec ( together with self - repulsive nonlinearity ) has revealed a wealth of new phenomena originally predicted theoretically , as e.g. in  @xcite , and subsequently observed in recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "these include the tunneling ( josephson ) oscillations for small numbers of atoms ; for higher atom numbers , more exotic states such as ones involving macroscopic quantum self - trapping were experimentally observed .",
    "prior to this work , as well as afterwards motivated by its findings , a wide range of theoretical studies investigated such dwp settings , examining issues such as few - mode reduced descriptions of the dynamics and symmetry - breaking bifurcations @xcite , quantum effects @xcite , and ( purely ) nonlinear variants of the dwp @xcite , among others .",
    "dwp settings and especially a signature feature therein , namely the potential presence of spontaneous - symmetry - breaking effects have also been studied in nonlinear - optical settings . there ,",
    "the formation of asymmetric states in dual - core optical fibers @xcite , self - guided laser beams in cubically nonlinear ( so - called kerr ) media @xcite , and optically - induced dual - core waveguiding structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite have been reported .",
    "in fact , it is this wide range of activities in the fields predominantly of optical and atomic physics that have led to books specifically dedicated to this subject  @xcite .",
    "recently , further experimental activity has ensured a renewed interest in this theme . in particular , the setting of two different hyperfine states of @xmath1rb was used to provide a remarkable manifestation of the symmetry - breaking transition ( i.e. , the pitchfork bifurcation arising in the double well because of the effective nonlinearity imposed by interatomic interactions )  @xcite .",
    "this enabled a full experimental mapping of the phase plane of the double well system with un - paralleled accuracy .",
    "additionally , extensions of the double well setting were considered in more complex higher dimensional settings such as a transversely elongated double well formulated within an atom chip in  @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present work is to explore the connections between the two above settings specifically by considering the realm of two db solitary waves and their existence , stability properties and nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we find , following up on the earlier investigation of  @xcite , that there are two possible stationary states consisting of db soliton pairs : one in which the bright `` pulses '' are in phase , and one in which they are out of phase .",
    "however , the latter configuration undergoes a symmetry breaking , destabilizing pitchfork bifurcation , which , in turn , produces a third branch whereby the bright components are asymmetric .",
    "this observation prompts us to examine the problem in the realm of double well potentials and two - mode approximations : more specifically , we consider the dark solitons as imposing ( when combined with the parabolic trap ) the effective dwp within which the bright component finds itself . by reverting to this effective dwp setting ,",
    "we are able to make explicit analytical predictions for the observed bifurcation that corroborate the full numerical observations .",
    "more generally , we are able to reconstruct the entire phase space in the plane of relative population imbalance versus relative phase of the two bright wavepackets .",
    "there is , however , one major difference compared to the static dwp which is the fact that in the present case the effective double - well is composed of a dynamic entity that is explicitly time dependent . numerous investigations @xcite-@xcite have shown that an externally imprinted driving of the dwp greatly affects the dynamics , leading for instance to stimulation or complete destruction of tunneling @xcite , chaotic tunneling currents @xcite or the creation of maximally entangled states on the many - body level @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the situation is even more involved , since the dark solitons effectively forming the double well obey their own equation of motion that is affected by the dynamics of the bright component inside this double well .",
    "we explore parameter regimes where this feedback effect between the two components strongly modifies the dynamics , steering away from the effective one - component picture and into a full two - component setting , where anharmonic and aperiodic motions can be observed .",
    "we will see that this last set of features distinguishes the db case from its vb analogue where many of these features ( tunneling , symmetry - breaking , etc . )",
    "can still be observed  @xcite , but the vortices are less responsive to the bright component s dynamics , forming a comparably fixed background substrate .",
    "our presentation of the above features will be structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the theoretical model of interest , while in section iii , we study the stationary states of the system and the symmetry - breaking bifurcations . in section iv , we analyze the system dynamics in the realm that can be captured by the two - mode , effective one - component approximation . in section",
    "v , we explore the limitations of the effective picture , by studying fully two - component dynamical scenarios .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",

    "( [ ceq ] ) can be found through continuation from the linear limit through the use of an iterative newton - raphson solver  @xcite . as trial wavefunctions",
    "we choose the lowest harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions where for the dark component we take the second excited state with two nodes and for the bright component either the ground state solution with no node that leads to the in - phase db soliton or the first excited state with one node that leads to the out - of - phase db soliton solution .",
    "to investigate the dynamics we employ a 4th order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "furthermore , in order to test the robustness of the stationary solutions , we employ a linear stability or bogoliubov de - gennes ( bdg ) analysis which consists of slightly perturbing the stationary solutions through the ansatz @xmath24 \\notag \\\\ \\psi_{d}(x , t)=e^{-i\\mu_{d}t}\\bigg [   \\phi_{d}(x)+\\epsilon\\sum_{k}\\bigg ( a_{k}(x)e^{-i\\omega_{k}t}+b_{k}^{*}(x)e^{i\\omega^{*}_{k}t } \\bigg ) \\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 are stationary solutions .",

    "the appearance of eigenfrequencies @xmath29 with a non - vanishing imaginary part implies dynamical instability .",

    "the corresponding phases are depicted.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the bdg analysis for the in - phase and out - of - phase solutions is shown in fig .  [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "as has been discussed in detail in numerous works ( see , e.g. , the review of  @xcite ) , the dbs constitute excited states of the system , a feature that is mirrored ( in their linearization ) through the emergence of so - called negative energy , or negative krein signature modes .",
    "for instance , for dark solitons in one - component becs , it was proved that an @xmath41-soliton state carries @xmath41 such modes  @xcite .",
    "these modes are particularly important since their potential collision with opposite ( positive ) krein signature modes gives rise to structural instabilities in the form of the so - called oscillatory instabilities or hamiltonian - hopf bifurcations .",
    "in the present setting the negative krein signature modes , also called anomalous modes , are depicted by red color in the bdg analysis of fig .",
    "interestingly , the symmetric , in - phase solution in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) possesses two anomalous modes which correspond to particle like oscillations ( in- or out - of - phase ) of the db solitons in the trap .",
    "this solution remains linearly stable in the considered regime of parameters , as can be seen from the lower panel that shows the imaginary part of the frequency spectrum which is zero .",
    "in contrast to this , fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , representing the spectrum of the out - of - phase solution , possesses three anomalous modes .",
    "the third anomalous mode that exists in this solution is due to the excited nature of the bright component wavefunction , which in the overall linear limit reduces to the first excited harmonic oscillator state .",
    "the dynamics of this third mode is found to correspond to an oscillating population imbalance between the two bright wave packets .",
    "this was first observed in the dissipative gpe framework ( for db pairs ) of  @xcite , where the third mode eigenfunction was added to the exact solution leading to the indicated imbalance .",
    "the out - of - phase bright components attract each other and in this case a negative energy linearization mode emerges that captures the tunneling of a fraction of the atoms from one atomic cloud ( i.e. , the one bright solitary wave ) to the other",
    ". an important additional feature of this mode is that over parametric variations ( such as the number of bright atoms @xmath42 ) , the mode may cross the origin of the spectral plane as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the resulting instability leads to a new , asymmetric stationary solution where the population of the bright component in the two dark solitons is different . following the antisymmetric ( out - of - phase ) branch to the point where it gets unstable and perturbing it with the corresponding instability eigenvector leads therefore to a new branch of stationary solutions whose bdg spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ; this asymmetric solution only exists past the relevant critical point of the eigenvalue zero - crossing while below it is identical to the antisymmetric branch .",
    "it possesses again three anomalous modes as the parental branch , but this new solution is linearly stable for all values of @xmath43 considered as can be seen from the imaginary part of the spectrum . at the point where the instability sets in in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , a symmetry breaking bifurcation of the pitchfork type occurs and the out - of - phase ( anti - symmetric ) branch gets unstable whereas a pair of new , stable asymmetric branches emerges .",

    "notice that the asymmetric branch only exists as such past the critical point of the eigenfrequency zero - crossing . below this value of @xmath42 , it coincides with the anti - symmetric branch .",

    "the inset shows a magnified view of the bifurcation point for better visibility.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this phenomenology is strongly reminiscent of the symmetry - breaking bifurcation in a dwp and hence inspires a theoretical approach to understand the relevant features .",
    "more specifically , in the case of negligible feedback of the bright component dynamics onto the dark component , another way to look at this symbiotic entity of the db solitons can be considered as follows . assuming a given ( stationary or time - dependent ) dark component wavefunction @xmath47 one may write @xmath48 and consider only the bright species in a single component problem with the effective gpe @xmath49\\psi_{b } \\label{ceqb}\\ ] ] as long as the time scales on which the dark solitons move and the tunneling dynamics of the bright component takes place are well separated , the effective double well potential in the equation above can be approximated as being time independent . in other parameter regimes ,",
    "the time dependence of the effective potential term and the dynamic feedback on @xmath50 can not be anymore neglected and the equation of motion of the dark solitons has to be included , that is the full two component gpe in eqs .",
    "( [ ceq ] ) has to be taken into account .",
    "let us focus for now on the first case where feedback is negligible and the solitons are essentially at rest ( such that the effective potential can be taken as time independent ) .",
    "we aim at a theoretical understanding of the bifurcation diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] making use of the effective one - component picture for @xmath51 . as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] already , the dark component wavefunction differs substantially for the in - phase and out - of - phase branch of the bifurcation diagram , due to the qualitatively different interaction between the db soliton entities .",
    "thus , for each of the two branches one has to use the appropriate @xmath50 in @xmath52 , taking into account the correct dark soliton equilibrium distance .",
    "then , for each of the two branches , @xmath52 is given by an effective dwp formed by the two solitons plus the harmonic trap , and solving eq .",
    "( [ ceqb ] ) yields two lowest eigenstates with even and odd parity , separated from all the higher eigenstates by a suitable energy bandgap .",
    "the idea then , in line with similar explorations in the dwp realm  @xcite is therefore to use a two - mode ansatz to describe the full wavefunctions near the linear limit given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the normalized symmetric and anti - symmetric eigenfunctions of the lowest two energy levels in the effective double well , respectively , and to use again an iterative continuation to reach larger values of @xmath42 . inserting this ansatz into eq .",
    "( [ ceqb ] ) , one can then use the analysis of the two mode expansion developed earlier ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) to deduce the critical values in the bright component particle number for which a symmetry breaking bifurcation of the pitchfork type emerges . in the symmetric branch",
    "no such bifurcation occurs whereas the anti - symmetric one becomes unstable at  @xcite @xmath55 with the critical value of the chemical potential @xmath56 ; @xmath57 is the energy difference between the lowest two eigenvalues of @xmath58 and the overlap integrals used in eq .",
    "( [ ncr ] ) utilize the symmetric and anti - symmetric eigenfunctions of the effective potential @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the analysis usually carried out for static double - well potentials , where both the symmetric and the anti - symmetric solution exist in one and the same external potential , a particular feature of the present setting is that we have to work with different double - well potential shapes for the two branches , due to the different dark soliton distances .",
    "we now apply eq .",
    "( [ ncr ] ) to estimate the critical values where the asymmetric branch emerges . as an input for the two - mode approach",
    ", we numerically solve the full gpe ( [ ceq ] ) for the out - of - phase db soliton pair and extract the wavefunction of the dark component .",
    "this is done for varying values of @xmath59 , while we fix @xmath60 , anticipating the rough position of the bifurcation point ( we have checked that a different choice of @xmath42 only weakly affects the results ) .",
    "for each @xmath59 we then construct the effective potential , find its lowest eigenstates and obtain the critical values from eq .",
    "( [ ncr ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the bifurcation point as a function of @xmath59 found from the full gpe and predicted by this effective potential two - mode approach is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; recall that in the case of the in - phase solution , no new branch bifurcates .",
    "the agreement is more and more exact with increasing @xmath61 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for larger particle numbers in the dark component the effective double - well gets deeper and the band gap becomes larger so that the two - mode approach in turn becomes more accurate .",
    "as will be seen in the dynamical simulations , the two - mode approaches based on these two different effective potentials are not only capable of capturing their respective fixed points as shown in the bifurcation diagram , but also the bjj phase space in the vicinity of these fixed points ( and only there ) .    ) and the galerkin two - mode approach for different @xmath61 as explained in the text.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    within the two - mode picture one can start from the symmetric and anti - symmetric wavefunctions in the respective effective potential and construct wavefunctions that are localized in the right and left well through @xmath62 with these localized wavefunctions one can expand the bright component in this basis according to @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the particle numbers in the left and right well respectively , @xmath65 the corresponding phases of the condensates in each well and @xmath66 . + in fig .",

    "they start therefore to oscillate away from the trap center until the harmonic trap counterbalances this motion . during the dynamics ,",
    "the parity symmetry of the bright component is fully preserved and there is no tunneling .",
    "the dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] is initiated by starting from the in - phase stationary db pair solution and suddenly switching the phase difference to a value close to @xmath79 .",
    "the db solitons experience a strong attractive force pointing towards the trap center and first start approaching each other .",
    "tunneling oscillations of the bright component are initiated . despite the complex dynamics seen in the full simulation of the coupled gpe system , within the two - mode projection one can still recognize parts of the old phase space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) . to illustrate this",
    ", markers have been added in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] which assign some specific points in phase space and show the time - order in which the trajectory is passed .",
    "naturally , an insistence to describe these types of evolution via a reduced phase - plane picture leads to meaningless results such as intersecting phase plane curves in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] clearly pointing out the insufficiency of the reduced description to capture the gpe picture .    .",
    "upper panel shows the density of the bright component , the lower panel that of the dark component.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    .",
    "the upper left panel shows the density of the bright component , the upper right panel that of the dark component .",
    "the lower left panel gives the reduced phase space picture and the lower right panel shows the population imbalance over time .",
    "markers show the time - order in which the trajectory is traversed .",
    "the starting point corresponding to a is the initial condition , b is reminiscent of plasma oscillations , c of self - trapped oscillations and d of @xmath79-oscillations.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "in the present work , we have illustrated the generic existence of two different stationary dark - bright soliton solutions in binary , repulsive , quasi - one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates .",
    "one of these two states possesses two bright solitary waves that are in - phase , while the other features an out - of - phase structure between these wavepackets .",
    "an instability of the out - of - phase two dark - bright soliton state was identified in the full system , leading to a symmetry - breaking bifurcation of an asymmetric state .",
    "mathematically , this was illustrated through the existence of an additional anomalous ( or negative krein signature ) mode associated with this asymmetry , which beyond a critical nonlinearity crosses to the imaginary eigenfrequency axis . to quantitatively address this symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation",
    ", we adopted an effective one - component picture wherein the dark solitons were assumed as constituting a fixed double well potential , within which the bright components evolved .",
    "this picture ( when appropriately taking into account the dark soliton equilibrium distances ) is very accurate in the vicinity of the stationary states and enables the observation of all the dynamical characteristics of the one - component double well potential system , including plasma and @xmath79-oscillations , as well as ( asymmetric ) self - trapped states .",
    "as expected , this static double well framework can not cover the full dynamics of the two - component gpe system , and indeed it was found to break down far from the stationary states . from a physical perspective , this breakdown arises due to the flexible nature of the double - well substrate , namely the fact that the feedback of the bright into the dark solitons leads the latter to dynamically evolve and oscillate as well , rather than retain the character as a fixed background potential . from the perspective of dynamical observations , this phenomenon led to the manifestation of other possible outcomes such as the periodic oscillation of the entire dark - bright soliton pair , or the aperiodic motion thereof .",
    "it is relevant to interject here a comment about the comparison of these features to the ones observed in a quasi - two - dimensional analogue of the system in  @xcite . in the analysis of two vortex - bright states in two dimensions the dark component",
    "s vortices were found to be less responsive to the bright component s tunneling dynamics , and if a slight particle - like precessional motion of the vortices was induced , its time scales were observed to be well separated from those of the tunneling oscillations .",
    "this is no longer true for the dark - bright solitons in one dimension where regardless of the ratio @xmath95 the solitons can be found to move ( under suitable initial conditions ) .",
    "a fundamental difference between the two - dimensional and the one - dimensional case is that the particle - type interaction between dark solitons is directed along their line of sight ( and thus aligned with the mass transfer of the tunneling bright component filling them ) , while the interaction between two vortices acts perpendicularly to their line of sight .",
    "furthermore , the topological nature of the vortices may impede a modification of their structural characteristics , while this is certainly not impossible in the dark soliton case , where the continuum of dark / gray soliton solutions may facilitate a back - action on the solitons forming the effective potential for the tunneling .",
    "the present work opens several possibilities that are worthwhile to consider for future studies .",
    "although all of the dynamics reported here are essentially localized in nature , we have not attempted to utilize the dynamical picture put forth e.g. in  @xcite about dark - bright soliton interactions in order to attempt to understand the observed phenomenology .",
    "this is certainly something that would be relevant to do , both at the level of stationary states , but also at that of the stability and of the observed dynamics .",
    "while the effective two - dimensional phase space reduction can be seen to be inadequate in certain regimes herein , it would be natural to expect that still a simplifying description with only few degrees of freedom ( taking into account , e.g. , also the dark soliton positions as dynamical variables ) may help in capturing the different features exhibited by the infinite dimensional gpe system",
    ". a relevant effort would certainly be worthwhile to undertake also in higher dimensions , including vortex - bright solitary waves in 2d and vortex - ring - bright solitary waves in 3d . in the case of the higher dimensional structures ,",
    "a more detailed understanding of the possible dynamical features and of the interactions between the coherent structures is still far from complete , although important recent steps are being made in that direction  @xcite .",
