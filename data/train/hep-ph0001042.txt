    "although during the last few decades much progress has been done in the theoretical study of hadron structure , the non - leptonic weak decays of hyperons still remain far from being well understood .",
    "this class of decays involve not only weak interactions but also low momentum strong processes , which have made their first principle calculation unfeasible so far .",
    "in this situation , different hadron models have been used to get the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "the available experimental information allows to determine both @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave decay amplitudes separately for various processes . in the case of",
    "the @xmath3-wave decays , the predictions given by quark models with qcd enhancement factors turn out to be quite successful ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these models , however , have serious difficulties in reproducing at the same time the empirical results in the case of the @xmath4-wave amplitudes .",
    "indeed , this seems to be a problem ( so called `` @xmath5 wave puzzle '' ) which is common to other approaches as e.g.  heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory@xcite , qcd sum rules@xcite , etc .",
    "a possible solution to the @xmath5 wave puzzle has been suggested some years ago within the context of chiral topological soliton models@xcite .",
    "it was shown that in these models the @xmath4-wave amplitudes receive , in addition to the standard pole diagrams , extra contributions from contact terms .",
    "then , it was speculated that these extra terms could provide a clue to this issue .",
    "unfortunately , at the time this suggestion was made such models were hampered by several serious problems , such as very poor predictions for the hyperon spectrum@xcite , far too small results for the @xmath3-wave non - leptonic decay amplitudes@xcite , etc .",
    "therefore , it was hard to draw definite conclusions about the real relevance of the contact terms . with the introduction of more refined methods to treat the chiral symmetry breaking terms in the effective action",
    "the situation has significantly improved .",
    "indeed , a scheme in which one introduces @xmath0 collective coordinates and the hamiltonian including a symmetry breaking piece is diagonalized exactly leads to very good results for the hyperon spectra , as well as reasonable predictions for different baryon properties ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown@xcite that within such scheme , and using a simple cabbibo current - current form for the weak interaction , one can obtain the correct @xmath3-wave absolute values .",
    "thus , we are now in position to verify whether chiral soliton models can provide a unified and consistent description of the hyperon non - leptonic decays . in this work",
    "we will describe the weak interactions by means of an effective weak chiral lagrangian which is more general than the cabbibo current - current coupling often used in previous skyrme model calculations @xcite , where the low energy coupling constants will be fixed to reproduce the known @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath6-meson decays .",
    "we will concentrate mostly in the dominant octet - like piece of this @xmath7 lagrangian , considering terms up to order @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , possible non - octet contributions will be considered for the particular case of the @xmath9 amplitude which , as well known , vanishes in the pure octet approximation .",
    "the non - leptonic hyperon decay amplitudes will be obtained by evaluating the corresponding matrix elements using the topological soliton model wave functions .",

    "ii we give a brief overview of the @xmath0 soliton model and introduce the octet - like weak effective chiral lagrangian to be used in the following two sections . in sec .",
    "iii and iv we describe the calculation of the @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave amplitudes respectively , and present the corresponding results .",
    "the impact of the non - octet - like components of the weak effective lagrangian is discussed in sec .",
    "v and in sec .",
    "vi we state our conclusions . finally , in the appendix we give some details concerning the evaluation of the matrix elements of the collective operators which appear in the calculation of the decay amplitudes .",
    "in chiral topological soliton models baryons are described as topological excitations of a chiral effective action which depends only on meson fields .",

    "however , to this order , it has been shown@xcite that the couplings considered in ( [ weaklag ] ) are sufficient to fit the known data on @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the absence of further information from the meson sector",

    "this is achieved using @xmath52 where @xmath53 . inserting this expression into @xmath54 and taking the appropriate matrix elements one",
    "can obtain the desired @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave decay amplitudes .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has been recently shown@xcite that if the cabbibo current - current form is used to describe the weak interactions , the present soliton model leads to a reasonably good description of the @xmath3-wave hyperon decay amplitudes . in this section",

    "( [ weaklag][kamval ] ) .    as usual",

    "thus from ( [ samp ] ) one obtains @xmath66 .",
    "the remaining @xmath61 amplitudes can be calculated by replacing eqs .",

    "our results for the @xmath61 amplitudes are summarized in table [ tasw ] , where we also quote the values corresponding to the quark model ( qm )  @xcite . following the usual convention ,",
    "the overall phase has been fixed to obtain @xmath71 real and positive .",
    "it can be seen from the table that the predictions obtained with set  a are about 15 % higher than those arising from set  b. in both cases , our results are somewhat below the experimental values . however , since the deviation is in the same direction for all processes ( notice that this is not the case for the qm values ) , the agreement is significantly improved if one considers the ratios between the different amplitudes . in general",
    ", it could be said that our results and those corresponding to the qm are of similar quality .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the present results with those of previous soliton calculations .",

    "the best agreement with empirical data has been obtained in ref.@xcite where , as done here , the baryon wavefunctions arise from an exact diagonalization of the su(3 ) collective hamiltonian . generally speaking the results reported in table  [ tasw ] are somewhat smaller ( in absolute value ) than those of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the present calculation is free from the uncertainties related to the question of whether ( and to which extent ) qcd enhancement factors have to be included in soliton calculations . here",
    ", such factors are already accounted for in the value of the low energy constants that appear in the weak lagrangian . on the other hand ,",

    "the author studies weak decays of hyperons in a chiral topological soliton model , starting with a @xmath7 lagrangian including six @xmath45 terms .",
    "as shown in the addendum , the cayley - hamilton theorem can be used to reduce these six terms to only four independent ones . moreover ,",
    "following the same steps as in our calculation , one arrives to further relations between the corresponding hyperon decay amplitudes . at the end",
    "one is effectively left with only two terms , which as done in the present work can be chosen to be those proportional to @xmath72 and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ weaklag ] ) . following ref.@xcite",
    ", one might try to see whether it is possible to find a set of coefficients for those terms capable to reproduce the empirical values for both kaon and hyperon decays . for this purpose , and",
    "in order to relate the coefficients with the hyperon amplitudes , the author of ref.@xcite makes use of the relation ( [ amp ] ) and takes the @xmath0 symmetric limit . in this way",
    "all decay amplitudes can be expressed in terms of one of them and the @xmath73 ratio .",
    "the use of empirical values for the latter leads to an incompatible system of equations , so that the author argues that this precludes a successful application of the chiral lagrangian model .",
    "we believe that the results found in the present work provide some ground to disagree with such strong conclusion .",
    "in fact , the relations in ref.@xcite are expected to be modified by @xmath0 breaking effects and by next - to - leading order corrections in @xmath74 , which in general introduce modifications to eq .",

    "it is well known that the usage of phenomenological values in ( [ bpole ] ) does not allow to get a good fit of the experimental values . in this sense ,",
    "the contact contributions have been suggested as a possible novel ingredient to solve the discrepancy .",
    "our results show , however , that the values for @xmath93 amount at most 1/10 of the empirical @xmath62 amplitudes .",

    "ii , the non - leptonic decay amplitudes are dominated by the octet - like components of the weak effective lagrangian , hence only these components have been considered in the previous two sections . on the other hand , we have also mentioned that this approximation leads to a vanishing @xmath59 @xmath3-wave amplitude .",
    "in fact , the experimental value of @xmath100 , although significantly smaller than the other measured @xmath3-wave amplitudes , is found to be different from zero . in this section we will investigate whether within the present model the standard non - octet - like contributions to the weak effective lagrangian are able to account for this difference .",
