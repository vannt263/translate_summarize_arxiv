    "diffusion is a fundamental macroscopic phenomenon in physical systems , which , for instance , characterizes the spreading of tracer particles in a solvent . at a mescoscopic scale",
    ", it can be traced to the cumulative effect of many `` random '' displacements , as in brownian motion @xcite . at the underlying microscopic scale , however , the dynamics of a system are deterministic",
    ". deterministic diffusion concerns the study of microscopic models whose deterministic dynamics also exhibit diffusive behavior at a macroscopic scale @xcite .",
    "a particularly appealing , physically motivated model which does exhibit this phenomenon is the periodic lorentz gas @xcite . here",
    ", independent point particles in free motion undergo elastic collisions with fixed hard disks in a periodic array .",
    "the diffusive motion can then be considered to be a result of the chaotic nature of the microscopic dynamics , according to which nearby initial conditions separate exponentially fast due to the convex nature of the obstacles .",
    "thus a cloud of ( non - interacting ) particles in this lorentz gas spreads out over time in a way similar to that of solutions of the diffusion equation , @xmath0 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle } \\sim 4 d t,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes the position of a tracer at time @xmath2 , with initial position @xmath3 , and the mean squared displacement is computed as an average @xmath4 over many realizations of this process .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath5 , is a constant which depends on the geometrical parameters of the system , i.e. , the underlying microscopic dynamics .",
    "the diffusion coefficient summarizes the macroscopic behavior of the system while capturing the microscopic properties of the dynamics that lead to it .",
    "a central question in deterministic diffusion is to understand how this dependence on the geometrical parameters comes about .",
    "this has been addressed in particular by machta and zwanzig @xcite , who showed that in the limit where the obstacles are close together , the motion reduces to a stochastic bernoulli - type hopping process ",
    "a _ random walk_between `` traps '' . by calculating the diffusion coefficient of this random walk",
    ", they were able to obtain a reasonable agreement with the numerically - measured value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the approach of machta and zwanzig was extended heuristically by klages and dellago @xcite , by including important physical effects not taken into account in the simple random - walk picture , namely a possibly non - isotropic probability of changing directions , and of crossing two traps at once .",
    "klages and korabel @xcite then provided an alternate approach , in which they employed a green - kubo expansion of the diffusion coefficient to obtain a series of increasingly accurate approximations , based on numerically - calculated multi - step transition probabilities .",
    "in one particular lorentz gas model , they showed that their results are in good agreement with this expansion , see also @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , as we emphasize below , the physical motivation , and indeed the physical meaning , of this approach , are not clear .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that in fact the correct expansion beyond the machta - zwanzig approximation is to incorporate this type of correction in the framework of _ persistent random walks_. in other words , to be consistent , memory effects of a given length , whether one or several steps , must be accounted for through their contribution at all orders in the green - kubo formula relating the diffusion coefficient to the velocity auto - correlations .",
    "this is physically strongly motivated , and provides the correct way of incorporating correlation effects , in principle , of any finite order .    in the usual periodic lorentz gas on a triangular lattice considered in @xcite , the model is sufficiently isotropic that higher order contributions are small and can be safely neglected . however ,",
    "when the correlation effects are very strong , this is no longer the case .",
    "we introduce a billiard model with this property and show that , whereas a green - kubo  type expansion fails except very close to the machta - zwanzig limiting case , the approximation based on a first - order persistent random walk is in reasonable agreement with the data . by further considering memory effects up to two successive steps , we find that the agreement between the numerically - measured diffusion coefficient of the billiard table and that of the second - order persistent random walk extends to an appreciably larger range of parameters .",
    "consider the periodic lorentz gas on a triangular lattice , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.table-hc ] .",
    "the centers of three nearby disks are identified as the vertices of equilateral triangles which , in our notation , will be taken to be of unit side length . denoting by @xmath6 the radius of the disks , we let @xmath7 denote the spacing between disks . when @xmath8 , the triangles form closed traps from which the tracer particles can not escape .",
    "if , however , @xmath9 , then we expect the particles to remain inside the cell for a long time before they can escape to another cell . this argument can be made precise using ergodic theory @xcite . given a tracer of unit velocity ,",
    "the mean trapping time @xmath10 is given in terms of the ratio of the cell area to the lengths of the holes by @xcite @xmath11 assuming that this time is longer than the typical decay of correlations , machta and zwanzig @xcite argued that the diffusion coefficient of the lorentz gas can be approximated by a memory - less random walk ( called the `` short - memory approximation '' in @xcite ) , @xmath12 where , in our notation , the lattice spacing @xmath13 .",
    "taking further account of memory effects , klages & korabel @xcite noted that the machta - zwanzig approximation ( [ dmz ] ) is the zeroth order expansion of a series given by the green - kubo formula for the diffusion coefficient : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the jump vector ( `` velocity '' ) between traps on the @xmath16th step , and @xmath17 are _ auto - correlations _ of the velocity at steps @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "the approach taken in @xcite was to truncate the expression at a finite value of @xmath16 , assuming that all higher - order correlations are @xmath18 .",
    "they showed that by numerically calculating the terms appearing in this equation , the results evaluated by this truncation converged to the numerically - obtained diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , this ad hoc truncation has no physical meaning : if @xmath19 , it is not true that higher - order correlations @xmath20 vanish .",
    "rather , assuming that the process has memory of the previous step alone  which we will refer to as the single - step memory approximation ",
    "one must compute the correlations @xmath17 in a consistent way , and evaluate the diffusion coefficient ( [ dcoef ] ) by taking all the @xmath16 s into consideration .",

    "is well developed , and consists of treating it as a random walk with internal states , which , in this case , describe the direction with which the walker arrives at a site .",
