    "this contribution to the volume dedicated to michel hnon is a comment and amplification of a theme he introduced in his phd thesis , defended in 1961 at the university of paris @xcite .",
    "evry schatzman was his advisor , and andr danjon ( by this time , an old man , born in 1880 ) chaired the committee .",
    "shortly afterwards , michel hnon went to princeton university , being invited by lyman spitzer .",
    "there he invented the famous `` hnon - heiles '' model , introduced as a student 3-month project for carl heiles . coming back to the phd thesis , it concerned a problem of astrodynamics , the dynamics of globular clusters . in the words of michel hnon ( this is an extract of a cv ) : `` in my thesis ( 1961 ) , i proposed that the evolution of a cluster under the effect of binary encounters leads to the formation of an infinite density cusp at the center ... later ( 1966 ) , i suggested the use of a monte carlo approach in order to speed up the numerical computation of cluster evolution ... this allowed me in particular to simulate what is now called the ' ' post - collapse evolution `` of a cluster and to show that it is characterized by a general expansion of the cluster , fed by a flow of energy out of the central binary star . ''    what makes globular clusters interesting and challenging is , among other things , their high central density and their spherical shape .",
    "they are local bound states of approximately ten thousand to one million stars , spread over a volume of several tens to about 200 light years in diameter . for example",
    "terzan 5 , see figure [ fig : terzan ] , which is located deep within our galaxy and slightly above the galactic plan , has the highest density of stars of all known globular clusters , about @xmath0 times the average concentration of stars in the milky way ; moreover it contains the largest number of millisecond radio pulsars ( rapidly rotating binary neutron stars ) .",
    "compared to other physical `` many body '' systems , globular clusters have the enormous advantage for theoreticians to depend on newton s attraction , a very well defined interaction law .",
    "but , from the point of view of statistical mechanics , the long range character of the gravitation potential makes impossible a study by gibbs - boltzmann statistical mechanics and one has to turn to other methods .",
    "this is what hnon did in his phd work .",
    "he mixed two approaches . at the time",
    "( early nineteen sixties ) , numerical computation was in a very early stage but hnon tried nevertheless to compare results of his numerical approach with those of his analytic work .",
    "he discovered that globular clusters , seen as an initial value problem with many interacting stars , tend to form , after a finite time , what he called an `` infinite density cusp '' at their center ( the word `` cusp '' is in his resum , not in the original text of his thesis ) .",
    "this cusp is only a mathematical idealization valid in the limit of a continuous density , instead of a gas of discrete point masses .",
    "he understood as well that , once the cusp is formed , in the real physical system of discrete masses , this center is actually a place where binaries form .",
    "he considered those pairs as a sink of negative energy , so that the singularity at the center is a source of positive energy for the rest of the cluster .    in this contribution we comment on these results , after many others who have investigated after hnon s work the theory of self - gravitating systems",
    "( see the recent papers @xcite and @xcite and references herein ) . in the next section we comment on the fact that statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems is an out - of - equilibrium problem , and we illustrate the role of pair formation in the simple 3-body case of jupiter - saturn orbiting around the sun . in section [ sec :",
    "equations ] we present the kinetic approach to the @xmath1 body self - gravitating problem , restricted to the collisionless ( mean - field ) case which is described by vlasov - newton ( also named vlasov - poisson throughout this paper , @xcite ) equation and explain how it can be solved by adding some conditions .",
    "we discuss more specifically the existence and properties of cusp - core _ steady - state _ solutions with finite mass and energy , obtained within the frame of isotropic distribution of both velocity and position .",
    "the solution we consider have singular potential @xmath2 ( and density @xmath3 ) at the center of the cluster .",
    "the potential obeys a modified lane - emden equation ( modified to ensure convergence of the total mass and energy of the cluster ) .    , from hubble space telescope .",
    ", height=192 ]    we show in subsection [ subsec : dim ] that a one parameter family of cusp - like solutions exists besides the steady solutions , with same mass .",
    "they display an oscillating behavior around the steady cusp - core solution , the amplitude of the oscillations increasing towards the center of the cluster as @xmath4 , namely periodic versus the variable @xmath5 . in subsection",
    "[ susec : nearcusp ] we comment on the way to treat the problem close to the center where a continuous vlasov - type description is not valid .",
    "we define a region @xmath6 where the graininess of the density must be taken into account ( where vlasov - poisson equation is not valid ) .",
    "this requires to solve the full dynamical problem of interacting point masses , and suggests to use a matching method for connecting this solution to the outer valsov - poisson one . in section [ sec : exact ] we discuss the role of the angular momentum .",
    "we point out the irrelevance of the isotropic velocity hypothesis in a dynamical problem starting with zero angular momentum , nevertheless we show that in this case a steady cusp - core solution exists if a pure radial motion is assumed , i.e. with zero angular momentum .",
    "this conclusion leads us to reconsider in section [ sec : collapsedust ] the gravitational collapse of a dust gas where initially masses are immobile .",
    "such a dust gas has been treated by mestel , larson and penston @xcite shortly after hnon s defense .",
    "they give an explicit analytical solution for its dynamics up to a finite time , at which the core density becomes singular .",
    "we suggest to search an after - collapse solution for this dust gas case which differs drastically from the fluid case where the matter accumulates at the center without crossing it . in the case of a dust gas",
    ", the flux of particles with negative velocity ( inward motion ) may cross the central part of the medium and continue their way with positive velocity ( outward motion ) .",
    "this yields a multivalued velocity field , which is impossible in dense matter , but allowed in a dust gas .",
    "somehow the dust gas represents a prototype for the study of evolution of a globular cluster or more generally of a system of self - gravitating point masses .",
    "gibbs - boltzmann equilibrium theory can not be applied to globular clusters because there is no well defined microcanonical ensemble . for a finite number @xmath1 of an _ isolated _ set of masses @xmath7 located in a finite domain ,",
    "the thermodynamical quantities are well defined : assuming that all microstates are equiprobable ( a postulate for hamiltonian systems ) , one can show that the most probable distribution @xmath8 of a macrostate ( specified by the number @xmath9 of particles contained in the @xmath10 microcells with size @xmath11 , namely @xmath12 ) , is the one which maximizes the boltzmann entropy    @xmath13    at fixed mass @xmath14 and energy . that gives the mean - field maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath15 where the gravity potential is a solution of the boltzmann - poisson equation @xmath16 , and where @xmath17 is the inverse temperature .",
    "moreover for non - rotating systems the maximum entropy state is spherically symmetric .",
    "however the above approach leading to the global maximum of the entropy fails to describe globular clusters because the density of states @xmath18 diverges when some particles can go to infinity or can get a very large kinetic energy ( in equation ( [ eq : dens - micro ] ) the energy is given by the relation @xmath19 ) .",
    "it means , among other things , that thermodynamical concepts like temperature , entropy , and so on can not be used to describe globular clusters even with a finite number of stars ( see below the 3 body case ) .",
    "therefore no equilibrium state exists , and the equilibrium state ( [ eq : boltzdistrib ] ) will never be reached .",
    "however it could be possible that long - lived metastable states exist , that are local maxima of @xmath20)$ ] at fixed @xmath21 and @xmath22 . kinetic theory is required to inform about the time scales and to predict which metastable equilibrium state",
    "are reached from given initial data .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that globular clusters , as we see them now , are the result of the evolution of an isolated set of @xmath1 stars , as argued in @xcite they could well be the result of a slow aggregation of stars already present in the galaxy .",
    "the microcanonical distribution    @xmath23    is defined in general for a system of energy @xmath21 as an uniform distribution of probability on the surface ( or manifold ) of constant energy .",
    "this probability distribution , to be well defined , requires that the total probability @xmath24 is well defined too .",
    "this total probability is the volume of the manifold of constant energy . in the case of gravitational interaction",
    ", this manifold of constant energy has an infinite volume so that the microcanonical partition function , or density of states @xmath24 , does not exist ( it is given by a diverging integral ) .",
    "this divergence is due to the fact that the potential energy is not bounded from below : at constant total energy , the kinetic energy of many masses may increase indefinitely at the expanse of the potential energy of a pair getting closer and closer .",
    "the most diverging part in the volume of phase space comes from configurations when only one pair becomes deeply bound to get a very large negative potential energy , although all the other stars get a large positive kinetic energy . usually , in a regular gibbs - boltzmann system with converging microcanonical partition function the point representing the state of the system",
    "explores in its dynamics the phase space uniformly in the course of time . the wandering in phase space of finite volume of the gibbs - boltzmann theory",
    "is changed for systems with gravitational interaction into an evergoing exploration of phase space . as argued in @xcite this situation",
    "is not so unusual : one meets something similar when dealing with a point diffusing by brownian motion in 1d : if one considers diffusion on a segment of finite length , statistical properties derived by time average are well defined and independent on time , because the equivalent of the microcanonical partition function is just the length of the segment . if one considers instead the diffusion on the full real line of infinite length ( and so with a diverging microcanonical partition function ) , any averaging will yield a time dependent result , the average squared abscissa will grow proportional to time , etc . similarly , in the exploration of phase space by 3 masses ( for instance ) in a box @xcite , no average quantity exists in general , only time dependent quantities .",
    "in particular the part of phase space giving the most diverging contribution to the divergence of the microcanonical integral is the one dominating the exploration for long time . in the present problem ,",
    "this maximal divergence is the one where a pair has an binding energy tending to minus infinity , an energy transferred to the kinetic energy of the other masses which grows to plus infinity , again to maximize the volume of phase space they explore .",
    "a case of such an exploration of infinite phase space is the one of a pair of masses in the gravity field of a large immobile mass , like jupiter and saturn orbiting in the field of the sun . of course",
    ", we know well that part of the phase space for this three - body problem is filled with quasi - periodic orbits , thanks to the kam theory . however , as the hnon - heiles model shows , another part is filled by random orbits and so can be understood , at least qualitatively , by using statistical methods ( instead of the perturbation methods first imagined by newton ) . therefore , in the case of this three - body problem sun+saturn+jupiter it is likely that the two planets will have a chance to make a close encounter which will put enough kinetic energy into the system to allow the evasion of one planet , by transferring the kinetic energy of the two close - to - keplerian orbits around the sun into the kinetic energy needed for the evasion . in this respect",
    "it is well possible that the 3-body problem bears some similarities with the @xmath1-body problem , @xmath1 large , where close interaction / collisions are responsible of the evaporation of stars out of the cluster @xcite .",
    "one may conjecture that the kam part of phase space ( associated to quasiperiodic motion , not described by a non smooth invariant measure ) will become of smaller and smaller relevance as the number of planets increases .",
    "therefore planetary systems with more than three or four big planets will likely not survive long because of this possibity of evasion after close encounter between two planets orbiting in the field of the star . in this respect",
    "it is relevant to point out the often observed `` numerical '' fact that ergodicity sets - in in non integrable systems with `` many '' degrees of freedom as soon as the number of freedom grows .",
    "one may conjecture that the relative weight of the kam part of phase space decreases with @xmath1 , number of freedom , in an exponential way , as does the chance of falling on quasi - periodic orbits with randomly chosen initial conditions .",
    "this example of planets orbiting in the gravitational field of a big star helps to explain what happens near the cusp of density at the center of a cluster .",
    "close enough to this cusp , the stars can not be considered anymore as belonging to a continuum .",
    "hnon derived from this remark an explanation for the pairing of stars occurring near the cusp and the idea that , because pairs may have a large negative binding energy , the cusp is a provider of positive energy to the rest of cluster .",
    "this is discussed in subsection [ susec : nearcusp ] below .",
    "in this section we outline the analytical approach to the mean - field theory of a large number @xmath1 of interacting point masses . as explained in @xcite , by taking advantage of this large number",
    ", one can carry a formal expansion in inverse powers of @xmath1 such that , at leading order , the dynamics is given by the solution of the vlasov - newton ( also called vlasov - poisson or mean - field equation @xcite ) . at next order with respect to the small parameter @xmath25 one has to add the boltzmann collision operator as a small perturbation , etc .",
    "the fundamental mathematical object of this mean field theory is the one - body distribution function , denoted as @xmath26 below , a function with positive or zero values depending on time @xmath27 , of the position @xmath28 and velocity @xmath29 of a star ( boldface are for vectors ) .",
    "mathematically this function does not have to be smooth : it can have all sort of discontinuities , the only constraint is that it must be positive or zero , and yield finite mechanical invariants : total mass , energy and angular momentum .",
    "moreover to make things simpler we shall assume that stars have all the same mass .",
    "we shall assume the validity of a coarse grained ( or mean - field ) picture , where each star moves in the average field of the others , which is correct in the limit @xmath1 large if the density remains finite .",
    "the main difference with ordinary thermodynamics is that , a priori , one does not know for this system the form of this one - body distribution function in a steady equilibrium state . in a regular thermodynamic system at equilibrium ,",
    "the velocity distribution is just a maxwellian . here",
    "this can not be true for point masses , because this velocity distribution should be multiplied by a function of the position representing something like a laplace equilibrium of positions in the self - consistent gravitational field .",
    "this would be in obvious contradiction with the assumption that this describes an equilibrium state because it yields a non zero weight to initial conditions of stars escaping to infinity if their velocity is large enough .",
    "therefore there is no equilibrium one - body distribution function , and one should instead look at the steady solutions of the vlasov - newton equation written below .",
    "we give first the vlasov - newton equation and explain how it can be solved by adding some conditions .",
    "then we discuss more specifically the existence and properties of solutions with a singularity of density near the center of the cluster , a singularity studied first by michel hnon .",
    "the number density of stars @xmath30 is normalized in such a way that @xmath31 the position - velocity distribution @xmath32 and the number density are related by the formula :    @xmath33    the vlasov - newton equation describes the evolution of @xmath32 .",
    "as it is first order it keeps formally the property that if initially @xmath32 is positive , it remains so at later ( and former ) times .",
    "this equation reads : @xmath34 with @xmath35 the steady solutions of vlasov - newton in the spherically symmetric case ( no global rotation ) depend on the two constants of motion in a spherically symmetric potential , the energy @xmath21 and the square of the angular momentum .",
    "let assume also ( as did hnon ) that the velocity distribution is isotropic , @xmath36 , then the distribution depends on the energy only , and poisson equation    @xmath37    writes @xmath38 where    @xmath39    and where @xmath40 is related to @xmath41 by @xmath42    this set of equations can be solved explicitly @xcite by writing @xmath43 as a function of @xmath40 and inverting abel s transform on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : equphi0 ] ) .",
    "this solution is not very easy to handle , so that we shall deal below with the equations in the form ( [ eq : vlasnew]-[eq : equphi0 ] ) .",
    "an important quantity is the value of the gravity potential at @xmath44 . by taking @xmath2 equal to @xmath45 at @xmath43 infinity , and assuming that @xmath46 vanishes at @xmath47 and at infinity , the value of the potential at the center of the spherical cluster , when it exists , is equal to @xmath48    here we shall consider another possibility , the case where this integral diverges for @xmath43 close to zero , making @xmath49 infinitely negative",
    "this does not violate any basic principle , but requires that @xmath3 diverges as @xmath43 tends to zero , but not too strongly in order that the total mass and energy of the globular cluster remains finite .",
    "this is the situation that we consider below in subsection [ subsec : cusp ] . before to do this , we look first at some properties of vlasov - newton equation .",
    "we already pointed out some properties of vlasov - newton kinetic equation ( [ eq : vlasnew ] ) , like the fact that if its solution is positive or zero at some time it remains so at later times .",
    "other properties are the conservation of mass ( and number of stars , two non equivalent properties if stars have unequal masses , something we do not assume ) of total momentum , angular momentum and total energy .",
    "those properties are well known , and we shall only state them . the total number of stars has been already defined in equations ( [ eq : nombretotal])-([eq : integra ] ) , the linear momentum is @xmath50 where @xmath7 is the mass of each star .",
    "the angular momentum is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the usual cross product of two vectors .",
    "lastly the total energy reads    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the gravity potential , solution in this general case of the 3d poisson equation @xmath55 @xmath30 being related to @xmath56 by equation ( [ eq : integra ] ) .",
    "this completes the list of the mechanical invariants , mass , linear and angular momentum and energy . in the present case",
    "there is also an infinite number of other invariants , namely the values of the distribution function .",
    "this is because the distribution function obeys an equation of the liouville type .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : vlasnew ] ) expresses that the probability density @xmath26 is conserved along the flow lines of the velocity field defined by the equation of motion @xmath57 and @xmath58 because of liouville theorem the 6d volume element @xmath59 in phase space is conserved in the course of time , so that the probability density in phase space is conserved along the flow lines .",
    "therefore any integral like @xmath60 is constant in the course of time , for any function @xmath61 such that @xmath62 is given by a convergent integral .",
    "this puts various constraints on the solutions of the vlasov - newton equation .",
    "first , because the values of @xmath63 are convected along the flow lines of the equations of motion just written , an infinite value of @xmath63 , as the one discussed below , has to be also present in the initial conditions .",
    "moreover this pointwise conservation of the values of @xmath56 implies that there is no restoring mechanism to ensure the smoothness of @xmath56 , this is because there is no diffusion of @xmath56 perpendicular to the flow lines defined by the equations of motion written above .",
    "therefore the conservation of the values of @xmath56 during the evolution does not help much to find the steady state reached from given initial data : adding a small perturbation to this initial data with a fast variation in phase space will change the distribution of values of @xmath56 to first order , but without any effect on the dynamics , because the acceleration @xmath64 is given by an integral over space which smooths out the fast variations of @xmath56 in phase space . because of the absence of diffusion in phase space in the direction normal to the flow lines , there is no obvious way to tackle this problem of finding the steady state resulting from a given initial condition for the vlasov - newton equation .",
    "nevertheless one can predict that there is no hope to get a distribution function with a finite time singularity if the initial data for @xmath56 are uniformly bounded because they have to remain so forever .",
    "there exists an exact free - fall solution of a sphere of dust ( _ i.e _ a gas without pressure interacting only by the gravitational interaction ) leading to a density cusp at the center after a finite time depending on the initial distribution of density inside the sphere , see section [ sec : collapsedust ] .",
    "this does not contradict the property that an initially bounded solution of vlasov - newton remains so at any time , because this gas of dust corresponds to a velocity distribution which is initially a dirac delta function , obviously not a smooth bounded function of the velocity .",
    "we consider the case @xmath2 tending to @xmath65 as @xmath66 , and try to find a distribution @xmath67 such that the solution of the spherical vlasov - poisson system ( [ eq : vlasnew]-[eq : equphi0 ] ) has finite mass and energy .",
    "we use the most straightforward method , starting with an assumed form of @xmath67 , integrate over the velocity to obtain the density @xmath68 , equation ( [ eq : integra ] ) , and solve poisson equation ( [ eq : equphi0 ] ) , to get the corresponding potential @xmath40 . let us recall the behavior of the solution if the energy distribution is given by the most simple formula , the truncated power law @xmath69 with @xmath70 real positive exponent , @xmath71 ( maximum energy ) is a constant which is introduced to ensure that @xmath56 has compact support , @xmath72 is heaviside function and @xmath73 a normalizing constant . in the following the distribution @xmath56 has no compact support because we shall assume that the energy can get infinite negative values .",
    "the mass - density is computed via equation ( [ eq : integra ] ) , integrating by parts over the velocities and setting @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the beta function , or    @xmath77    with @xmath78 .    assuming that the maximum energy is negative , @xmath79 , equation ( [ eq : equphi0 ] ) can be written in a scaled form as    @xmath80    when using the scaled variables @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83^{-1/2}$ ] . finally defining the quantity @xmath84 , which is positive inside the cluster and tends asymptotically to @xmath85 as @xmath86 , we obtain the lane - emden equation for the `` relative '' ( with respect to @xmath87 ) potential @xmath88 ,    @xmath89    the literature on this equation usually rejects solutions with a density cusp at @xmath90 because it leads to infinite mass when considering its behavior at large @xmath43 .",
    "for that reason we shall consider separately the behavior of the power law solution of lane - emden equation as @xmath43 tends to zero ( where @xmath88 tends to @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 where @xmath88 goes to zero .",
    "let us first consider the behavior of a diverging power law solution for @xmath93 , and find the range of parameter @xmath70 which gives finite mass and energy in the central part of the sphere",
    ". at large negative @xmath21 , the relation @xmath94 inserted into poisson s equation yields    @xmath95    or @xmath96    where the negative exponent @xmath97 is consistent with the behavior of @xmath63 at large negative @xmath21 .",
    "the expansion of poisson equation close to @xmath47 gives @xmath98    close to @xmath47 the total energy converges if the integral @xmath99 converges .",
    "this requires    @xmath100    that is equivalent to the condition @xmath101 for the negative exponent in @xmath102 note that the condition of convergence of mass is less stringent .",
    "the critical value of the exponent @xmath103 is exactly the classical critical power beyond which the `` smooth '' ( with finite central density ) solution of lane - emden equation has infinite radius and mass .",
    "this divergence of radius and mass also occurs for the cusp - like solution with @xmath70 larger than @xmath104 , as illustrated in fig.([fig : phi-6])-b , dashed line .",
    "let us consider the outer part of the cluster , the domain @xmath105 .",
    "in this domain , the relative potential must tend to zero .",
    "assuming a power - law behavior for the energy distribution , @xmath106 , and considering the case @xmath107 , it can be easily shown that the condition for the mass to be finite is @xmath108 the condition on the energy being less drastic . finally ,",
    "any expression of @xmath56 which behaves at small @xmath43 like @xmath109 , and at large @xmath43 as @xmath110 with @xmath70 and @xmath111 fulfilling respectively the relations ( [ eq : condn ] ) and ( [ eq : nprime ] ) , could be physically relevant with a cusp at the center .",
    "as an example the function @xmath112^{\\frac{n - n'}{2}}$ ] could be a candidate , or the simplest form , @xmath113    that we shall investigate because it is analytically tractable .",
    "inserting expression ( [ eq : fsum ] ) for @xmath67 in equation ( [ eq : integra ] ) , the density becomes the sum of two terms ,    @xmath114    so that using the scaled variables defined just above , the equation for the relative potential @xmath115 writes    @xmath116    where @xmath117 . defining a scaled density @xmath68 by dividing the density ( [ eq : rhosum ] ) by the constant @xmath118 ,",

    "the case of steady state of globular clusters with @xmath138 is a priori different of the core of a dense star : near the center of the globular cluster , one should instead take into account the graininess of the mass density , namely replace the continuum described by vlasov - newton by a discrete set of interacting masses as explained below , subsection [ susec : nearcusp ] . in principle",

    "the exponent @xmath17 is found by imposing that the equations so derived are ordinary differential equations of functions of @xmath221 although the equations one starts from are partial - differential equations for functions of @xmath43 and @xmath27 , like the density and velocity field .",

    "fundamentally , this is because even a finite time singularity does not guarantee that the self - similar solution is of the first kind .",
    "actually , it happens in this problem that the solution found numerically @xcite follows the laws of the self - similarity of the second kind .",
    "the pressure term , assumed to be of the same order of magnitude as the gravitational term in the first kind , becomes actually negligible compared to gravity .",
    "that transforms the problem into a second kind and brings a freedom in the exponents .",
    "the free exponent is found from asymptotic matching arguments , because the inner self - similar solution must match the outer one , a constraint not satisfied by the first kind solution .",
    "this remark shows how careful one must be when dealing with singularities due to the collapse of a self - gravitating gas with pressure - like effects .",
    "in addition we have to note that the kinetic theory introduces in the dynamics something more complex than just a density - temperature dependent pressure .",
    "the first difficulty met when trying to extend the theory of steady states to time dependent systems concerns the validity of the isotropic velocity distribution hypothesis .",
    "a priori the distribution @xmath222 depends on the energy @xmath21 and angular momentum modulus @xmath223 with @xmath224 ( jeans theorem , see @xcite for instance ) , then the isotropic spherical models require that the distribution @xmath225 is uniform with respect to the angular momentum @xmath223 .",
    "however this assumption is disputable , and rarely fulfilled in numerical studies which generally assume zero velocity everywhere in the star , that implies a distribution depending both of the energy and angular momentum as discussed below .",
    "let us take an initial condition with radially symmetric distribution of position , and zero velocity , @xmath226 , with @xmath227 the dirac distribution and @xmath228 .",
    "then the angular momentum is null at time @xmath229 , and one may write @xmath230 . after an infinitesimal time , all masses will begin to fall toward the center making the velocity distribution obviously anisotropic .",

    "the inward motion is described by a distribution of the form @xmath232 ( with @xmath233 the radial component of the velocity , and @xmath234 its 2d orthogonal component ) , which leads to the form @xmath235 now let us see if a steady distribution with @xmath231 formally exists .",
    "assuming that the steady motion keeps this purely radial velocity dependance , and that close to the center the energy distribution is given by the simple formula @xmath236 , the density becomes @xmath237 when we insert the differential expression @xmath238 .",

    "nevertheless it is possible to solve the problem of evolution at least for short times after the first singularity .",
    "we plan to return to this subject in the future .",
    "however there is simple case where one can continue the dynamics after the first singularity and even forever , the case where @xmath292 is constant , not depending on @xmath316 , initial radial distance . in this case",
    "all the dust sphere collapse at the same time on the center , this time being the one formerly denoted as @xmath218 which becomes independent on @xmath316 when @xmath68 is constant .",
    "what happens next is rather straightforward : all particles reaching the center at @xmath317 bounce back by following a reflected trajectory : their order in the radial direction is unchanged , as the fastest ones are those coming from the edge of the dust sphere .",
    "therefore the mass @xmath284 in equation ( [ eq : newt1 ] ) remains the same as it was before the singularity , the only difference with the dynamics before this singularity is that the radial velocities are now positive , directed outward . at time @xmath318",
    "all particles reach a motionless state at the same radial position as they had at time @xmath319 , the initial time for the beginning of the collapse",
    ". therefore , the motion of the whole dust sphere is periodic of period @xmath318 , with a complete stop at each period and a collapse to the center a time @xmath218 after this complete stop .",
    "indeed one expects this will be changed as soon as the initial density distribution @xmath292 is not a constant anymore .    an understanding , even limited , of the problem of the solution of the dynamics of the dust sphere in this case would be very valuable , because it would yield a sure understanding of what happens in the dynamics of masses interacting gravitationally .",
    "this contribution to the volume in tribute to michel hnon has been written in a perhaps slightly unusual way , considering a specific problem , the occurrence of a finite time singularity of density , or density cusp . as we have seen",
    "this occurrence requires a number of special conditions to be satisfied , the most stringent from the point of view of physics is likely the absence , or at least the smallness of angular momentum in the initial conditions . as usual in astrophysics ,",
    "this question of the initial conditions is very hard to answer .",
    "the case of the dust gas ( with no kinetic energy at the beginning ) shows at least that such a singularity is possible .",
    "globular clusters , on the time scale of the period of the motion in the average field of the cluster should be seen as steady objects . however , and as had been seen by hnon , stars inside the cluster tend to evaporate and one may wonder why such clusters are still there .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the observed clusters are the result of an imbalance between evaporation and aggregation of surrounding stars in the galaxy .",
    "they would be therefore more like dynamical than static equilibria , this being seen on the time scale of the ( rare ) binary encounters in the cluster which can put stars of the cluster on an escape trajectory or stars from the galaxy in a bound trajectory .",
    "therefore , if this is correct , the question of what happens on the `` short '' orbital time in the evolution of the cluster is unrelated to any physical stage in the history of real clusters .    as had been suggested for a rather long time it could be that `` dark matter '' is necessary to account for the rotation speed of galaxies .",
    "this speed has long been observed to be noticeably larger than expected from the balance between the centrifugal force of visible matter and the centripetal inertia force .",
    "if this dark matter is made of particles interacting with their kins or with the others by gravitation only , one might wonder how this halo of dark matter survived over time the evaporation following close encounters either with the same particles of dark matter or ordinary matter in the galaxy .",
    "this puts bounds on the properties of this dark matter , on their density and mass in particular .",
    "michel hnon was a provider of many new ideas in astrophysics and in other fields as well .",
    "this communication tried to show how bright were his beginnings in science and how inspiring they continue to be .",
    "the thesis of michel hnon has been published , practically word - to - word , in annales dastrophysique @xmath320 pp 369 - 419 on the same year as his defence ( 1961 ) . c. mouhot `` stabilit orbitale pour le systme de vlasov - poisson gravitationnel '' sminaire bourbaki , 64 me anne , 2011 - 2012 , no 1044 , arxiv : 1201.2275v2 [ math.ap ] .",

    "astrophys . * 114 * , p. 211 - 212",
    "( 1982 ) ) on the naming of what we call `` vlasov - newton '' equation .",
    "according to this note , vlasov was only a late contributor to the field , having been preceded by jeans . indeed associating , as we do ,",
    "the name of newton to this equation is justified because newton was first not only to solve the two - body problem but he walked also the first steps on the path toward the elucidation of the n - body problem , inventing perturbation theory to find the corrections of the motion of the moon due to tidal forces from the sun .",
    "this demonstrates the difficulty in associating names of scientists to equations : despite common belief , newton never wrote anything like a `` newton equation of motion '' , something done by leibnitz and by varignon . from a `` practical '' point of view the naming of this equation as `` vlasov - poisson '' or",
    "`` vlasov - newton '' follows the trend and makes it recognizable by scientists working in the field .",
    "the name suggested by hnon , `` collisionless boltzmann equation '' is somewhat ambiguous because `` collision '' is not such a straightforward concept .",
    "actually , vlasov - like equation provides the leading order in an expansion of the kinetic operator with respect to the small strength of the interaction .",
    "the next order term in this expansion is the boltzmann collision operator . for long range interactions ,",
    "the writing of this next order term is a non easy endeavor , and was done in the nineteen sixties only by balescu and lenard for plasmas .",
    "the computation of this next order `` boltzmann collision operator '' for gravitational interaction has not been done yet completely .",
    "luciani and pellat @xcite derived a formal expression for this operator by using angle - action variables but , to our knowledge , this has not been used in practical calculations . in particular",
    "it is unclear if , in the luciani - pellat collision operator , the dominant contribution comes from binary encounters screened by a kind of debye cloud , as in balescu - lenard , or from interactions of the global modes of oscillations of the globular cluster @xcite .",
