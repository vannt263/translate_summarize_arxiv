    "quantum transport phenomena that involve the carrier s spin degree of freedom have attracted a lot of attention during the past decade.@xcite a number of studies have analyzed the spin polarized transport in ballistic regime and reported intriguing phenomena,@xcite and have opened up the possibility of new spintronic devices .",
    "it is also interesting to study the spin - dependent transport in diffusive and chaotic regimes because the interference of coherent electron waves shows a number of characteristic effects when the spin degree of freedom is taken into consideration .",
    "one of the special characteristics of diffusive and chaotic systems is the fluctuating nature of transport coefficients such as conductance.@xcite it is well understood that such fluctuations do not depend on the details of the sample parameters , but depend only on the symmetry of the system.@xcite the two relevant symmetries here are time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and spin - rotation symmetry ( srs ) .",
    "trs is broken by applied magnetic fields or by magnetic scattering due to magnetic impurities or magnetic domain walls . if trs is broken , systems are classified as unitary , regardless of whether or not srs is broken .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction breaks srs but preserves trs , and in this case the systems are classified as symplectic .",
    "when the spin degree of freedom is taken into account , the description of the conductance fluctuations becomes more complex .",
    "conductance fluctuations of 2-dimensional systems which are coupled to the ising spin glass is reported.@xcite it has been reported that the reduction of variance of conductance takes place due to the zeeman splitting in the sample region .",
    "@xcite altshuler and shklovskii had shown that the variance of the conductance is described by@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a dimension - dependent factor that is of the order of unity .",
    "@xmath2 is equal to 1,2 and 4 for orthogonal , unitary and symplectic systems , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is equal to the number of noninteracting series of energy levels with @xmath4-fold spin degeneracy .",
    "recent works have pointed out that the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) in a chaotic quantum dot in the presence of spin - orbit scattering shows new features.@xcite they have shown that the ucf in the presence of spin dependent scattering is interesting not only from the theoretical point of view but also from the experimental view point .",
    "the transport properties of mesoscopic systems depend not only on the sample but also on the states in the leads through which currents flow into and out of the sample and through which voltages are measured.@xcite how the transport properties and the universality class are changed by modulating lead states is a very interesting question , especially when the spin degree of freedom plays a role .    in this paper , we investigate the influence of the spin scattering on transport properties in disordered systems .",
    "we consider magnetic impurities in sample region and the zeeman field in the lead .",
    "three types of magnetic impurities are considered .",
    "we call these ising , xy and heisenberg , depending on the number of spin components . in order to calculate two terminal conductance",
    ", we employ the transfer matrix method@xcite that is extended to include the spin degree of freedom .",
    "magnetic impurities remove the spin degeneracy and break trs in certain cases .",
    "we find that the variance of the conductance is halved as the number of spin components of the magnetic impurities increases . when the zeeman field is applied in a lead , a further reduction of the variance is observed .",
    "in order to observe the crossover of the universality class with the increase of the zeeman field in the lead , we study the level spacing distribution of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "part of this work has been presented in the international conference , `` localisation 2002.@xcite",
    "we consider a two dimensional ( 2d ) system connected to two electrodes .",
    "the 2d system is constructed in the @xmath5- and @xmath6- directions and the current flows in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "there is an exchange interaction between the electron spin and the static local spins in the system .",
    "the one - electron hamiltonian is @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electron at the site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 on the 2d square lattice . on - site",
    "energy @xmath11 denotes the non - magnetic random potential distributed independently and uniformly in the range @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the hopping is restricted to nearest neighbors .    .",
    "@xmath13 is set to be @xmath14 and @xmath15 . ]",
    "we investigate how the variance of the conductance distribution of @xmath16 changes due to the presence of @xmath17 .",
    "the variance of conductance distribution for @xmath16 is determined by the symmetry , which is controlled by the hopping term , @xmath18 . if it is set to @xmath19 unit matrix",
    ", @xmath16 belongs to the orthogonal class .",
    "@xmath16 belongs to the unitary class when @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a peierls phase which is distributed uniformly in the range @xmath22 . to realize systems belonging to the symplectic class,@xcite we set the hopping @xmath23 and @xmath24 where the parameter @xmath25 denotes the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the additional term @xmath17 is the spin scattering term .",
    "@xmath26 is the pauli spin matrix and @xmath27 is the static local spin .",
    "we consider three types of magnetic impurities : ising , xy and heisenberg where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath27 is set to unity , and their components are distributed randomly according to the uniform distribution on @xmath31-dimensional sphere , @xmath31(=1,2 or 3 ) being the number of spin components .    in order to calculate the conductance , we employ the transfer matrix method @xcite and extend it to include the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the conductance @xmath32 is given by the landauer formula@xcite as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the transmission matrix including the spin degree of freedom and @xmath35 is the transmission eigenvalue . in the present simulation , the system size is @xmath36 in units of the lattice spacing        in fig.1 we show the variance of conductance in the presence of magnetic impurities where @xmath16 belongs to the orthogonal class .",
    "@xmath13 is set to be 4.0 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath37 ensemble averages are taken for each data . when @xmath38 , there is no magnetic scattering and the variance is close to that expected for the universal conductance fluctuation of orthogonal systems.@xcite for convenience , let us denote the variance of @xmath39 for the conventional orthogonal class as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that in the case of @xmath38 , @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath40 is 1/2 for the chaotic cavity , 8/15 for the quasi-1d wire , 0.74 for 2d , and 1.2 for 3d systems , respectively.@xcite    in the presence of the ising type impurities , no spin flip processes occur as in the conventional non - magnetic system .",
    "however , the up spin and down spin electrons are described by different wave functions , because the exchange field of magnetic impurities lifts the spin degeneracy . with sufficiently large @xmath43",
    ", these wave functions are no longer correlated , and the variance is represented by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the conductance through the up ( down ) spin channel . since both of the variances @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 , the sum @xmath49 becomes @xmath50    while ising type impurities do not rotate the spin direction , the spin flip process occurs in xy type impurities .",
    "then the variance is simply given by @xmath51 , since the factor of 4 coming from the spin degeneracy in the conventional non - magnetic orthogonal class is missing . though the hamiltonian is complex due to @xmath52 , the statistics of the transmission eigenvalues as well as the energy level statistics are that of the orthogonal class .",
    "this can be seen if we define the time - reversal operator @xmath53 as @xmath54 , where @xmath3 denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "this operator is anti - unitary , satisfies @xmath55 and commutes with the hamiltonian of the system including xy type impurities .    for heisenberg and xy type impurities",
    ", spin flips occur .",
    "however , when @xmath17 includes the heisenberg type scatterers , the hamiltonian no longer commutes with the time - reversal operator , and the system is classified into the unitary class .",
    "therefore , the variance is further reduced by a factor of 2 .    from these results , the variance of conductance in the presence of impurities is given by @xmath56 we have numerically inverstigated a square 2d system , but the argument above is general , and this relation should be valid in other dimensions.@xcite    figure 2 shows the change of the variance when @xmath16 is in the unitary class .",
    "parameters are the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "we consider the random magnetic field and the phase in the transfer integral is given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) . without magnetic impurities ,",
    "the system belongs to the unitary class with spin degeneracy and the variance is @xmath50 .",
    "ising type magnetic impurities removes the spin degeneracy and the variance becomes @xmath48 .",
    "spin flips occur due to the xy type magnetic impurities and the variance becomes half of the ising case . as shown in fig .  2",
    ", the variance of the conductance when @xmath17 includes the heisenberg type impurities is the same as in the case of the xy type , because the hamiltonian of neither system commutes with the time reversal operator .",
    "the reduction of the variance is also obtained when @xmath16 includes the spin - orbit interaction and the hamiltonian belongs to the symplectic class ( fig .",
    "once the magnetic impurities are included , irrespectively of the type of the magnetic scatterers , the variance becomes @xmath57 from @xmath48 .",
    "belongs to the orthogonal class , @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "for the sample with the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we set @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution without zeeman splitting in a lead ( @xmath62 ) fits to the form of gse while that with zeeman ( @xmath63 ) fits to gue . ]",
    "we then address the question of whether or not transport properties and the universality class can change as a result of an asymmetric spin population in the leads , i.e. , when the number of up and down spin channels in the leads becomes asymmetric as a result of zeeman splitting . we show that even if the sample is unchanged , the universality class can change under certain conditions .",
    "we consider the zeeman field in one of the leads , setting the other lead zeeman field free .",
    "the transverse energy of the channel @xmath64 in the lead @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the number of sites in the transverse direction ( @xmath6-direction ) , and @xmath68 denotes the strength of zeeman splitting and @xmath69 is the spin index .",
    "the channel @xmath64 is a propagating mode if , @xmath70 being the fermi energy .",
    "for example , when we set @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the number of up ( down ) spin channels becomes 27 ( 15 ) for the sample of width 30 sites .",
    "figure 4 shows the variance in the presence of ising and xy type impurities in a system including zeeman splitting in a lead . in this simulation , we set @xmath58 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the system size is again set to be @xmath75 in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "the population of up and down spins in one lead is always set to be symmetric ( @xmath76 ) , and that in the other lead is varied ( @xmath77 ) .    from this figure",
    ", we observe that the variance becomes almost half due to the zeeman splitting in the leads , even if the sample region is not changed at all .",
    "the effect of zeeman splitting is similar to that of increasing the number of spin component of the magnetic impurities .",
    "it should be noted that if the direction of the zeeman field is the same as one of the spin components of the scatters , the reduction in not observed .",
    "for example , in the case of ising type scatterers , applying the zeeman field in the @xmath78-direction does not change the variance while the halving of the variance is observed if we apply the zeeman field in @xmath5- or @xmath6-direction . the same is true for the case of the xy type scatters .",
    "we need to apply the zeeman field in the @xmath78-direction to observe the halving of the variance .",
    "we then show that the zeeman field in the lead changes the universality class of the system . to detect the crossover of the universality classes , we investigate the spacing distribution @xmath79 where @xmath4 is the interval between neighboring transmission eigenvalues @xmath80 s .",
    "an ensemble of about @xmath81 samples is simulated to get good statistics .",
    "figure 5 shows the spacing distribution @xmath79 of the transmission eigenvalue @xmath80 for the sample with spin - orbit interaction . in the absence of zeeman splitting in the leads ( @xmath62 )",
    ", @xmath79 is close to the wigner surmise for the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) . on the other hand , with zeeman splitting in the leads ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "@xmath79 is close to that for the gaussian unitary ensemble(gue ) .",
    "the reason for this crossover is that the asymmetry of up and down spins in the lead destroys the self - dual property of the scattering matrix.@xcite to be specific , we consider the @xmath82 component of the s - matrix @xmath83 which describes the transmission from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "the self - duality requires @xmath86 which means that the transmission probability from @xmath87 to @xmath88 is the same as that from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "this symmetry is broken when we apply the zeeman field in the lead , which lifts the degeneracy of @xmath87 and @xmath90 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have studied the effect of spin scattering in disordered systems on the fluctuating nature of the conductance .",
    "we have considered magnetic impurities in a sample and calculated transport properties .",
    "our results show that the variance of conductance is halved as the number of spin components of the magnetic impurities increases .",
    "halving of the variance of the conductance is also obtained when the sample includes magnetic field or spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of the zeeman splitting in a lead .",
    "halving of the variance of conductance is obtained when the direction of the zeeman field contains the component different from the component(s ) of the magnetic scatterers .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the change of the variance in the superconducting - normal junction.@xcite analyzing the transmission eigenvalues , the universality class has been shown to be changed by the zeeman field in the lead .",
    "the results are summarized in table i and schematically shown in fig .",
    "6 .    before concluding , we relate our results with that of aleiner and falko.@xcite they have obtained for the chaotic system @xmath91 where @xmath92 indicates the kramers degeneracy and @xmath93 if the spin flip process is present and @xmath94 otherwise .",
    "@xmath951,2 or 4 is determined by the universality class . setting @xmath96 we recover their interesting result .",
    "for example , when @xmath16 is classified into the orthogonal class , and @xmath17 includes the xy type magnetic impurities , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which gives @xmath99 . therefore , the present results are the extension of aleiner and falko @xcite to higher dimensions and to the inclusion of the effect of the zeeman splitting in the lead",
